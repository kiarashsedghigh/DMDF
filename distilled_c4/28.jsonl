As evidence she mentions the \u201cmocking\u201d of Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s uncertainty about how to eat fried chicken.\nHowever, candidates of both genders are routinely mocked when they eat \u201cdown home\u201d food in an uptown manner. It happened to Donald Trump and John Kasich in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Sullivan ignores this history.\nSullivan notes that Kamala Harris\u2019 \u201clong-ago love life has been parsed.\u201d I assume she\u2019s referring to the story of her affair with Willie Brown, the then-married California power broker who got Harris appointed to two commissions.\nSullivan offers no explanation as to why this story should be off-limits. Instead, she conceals the reason why it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 the fact that the \u201clove life\u201d in question involved the most powerful figure in Bay Area, and arguably California, politics.\nIs there any reason to believe that, if a male politician\u2019s rise had been aided by a powerful female lover, the media would ignore it? Certainly not if the male politician were a Republican.\nSullivan also ignores the scrutiny over trivial matters that male candidates receive. In 2014, the Washington Post scrutinized Chris Christie\u2019s high school baseball career.\nSullivan\u2019s Exhibit A is not Gillibrand or Harris, though. Inevitably, Exhibit A is Hillary Clinton.\nSullivan remains convinced that the sexist media cost Clinton the election. In support of this proposition she cites. . .Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton says so in her book \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d so it must be true.\nWhen a bad joke is the best evidence Clinton/Sullivan can summon that the media favored Trump because of his gender, you can be pretty sure the claim is without merit.\nSullivan says that even minor flaws in female candidates are treated as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Clinton has been in the middle of three serious scandals, each of which led to intensive investigations (two of them during Democratic administrations) \u2014 Whitewater/Castle Grande, Benghazi, and the email scandal for which she narrowly escaped prosecution. Yet far from being \u201cdisqualified,\u201d Clinton won more votes than her Republican opponent.\nSullivan also accuses Kellyanne Conway of sexism for \u201cbelittling\u201d Harris, Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar while praising Howard Schultz and Michael Bloomberg. Has it occurred to Sullivan that Conway and her boss would like to see Schultz or Bloomberg run as independents?\nHarris, Gillibrand, and Klobuchar aren\u2019t similarly situated to Schultz and Bloomberg, both of whom fall outside of the contemporary Democratic party in one way or another. Beto O\u201dRourke, a mainstream Democrat, provides an apt comparison to the three female candidates. Sullivan acknowledges that Conway belittled him too.\n[W]e\u2019re a sexist society, and the media reflect and amplify this. In some cases, female voters aren\u2019t immune \u2014 39 percent of them preferred Trump to 54 percent for Clinton, according to Pew Research.\nEven at the Washington Post, Margaret Sullivan stands out as a hack."}

Still, words escaped me the night of the tornado.\nI sat huddled in the basement, my arms wrapped around my nightgowned knees, wondering what kind of danger I was in. But the storm passed within an hour - a blustery, capricious thing - and I survived to see the morning and the destruction the night had brought.

{"idx": "28003", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In \u201cThis Book is Overdue: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All\u201d (Harper, 288 pp. $25), writer Marilyn Johnson has created a nuanced and adoring look at modern librarians \u2014 how they are remaking America\u2019s public libraries in the internet Age while protecting the nation\u2019s civil liberties.\nJohnson\u2019s exquisite book taps into the radical changes that libraries are going through. She blows apart the librarian stereotypes of stiff, prim matrons. Librarians have blogs now, some have extensive tattoos and funky haircuts, but in Johnson\u2019s eyes, they are still committed \u201cintellectual social workers,\u201d educating whoever comes through their doors in the face of brutal budget cuts. Johnson tells of librarians who faced down the Bush administration over the Patriot Act, and of wild librarians who perform dance routines with wooden book carts at librarian conventions. Johnson has created an uncompromisingly optimistic book celebrating the thin red line of highly educated and often grossly underpaid men and women who keep Americans literate.\nJohnson, 55, was on staff at Esquire and Life Magazine and her last book was \u201cThe Dead Beat,\u201d a history of obituaries. She lives in Westchester, N.Y., where she spoke from her home by telephone with freelance writer Dylan Foley.\nQ. You've written this quirky book about modern librarians. Why?\nA. Librarians have had my back for so long. They helped me so much when I was a magazine writer and when I was writing my book on obituaries. With the new book, I realized I was writing about a profession that was undergoing seismic changes.\nQ. Could you tell us about the Connecticut Four, a small group of library administrators who, at great personal risk, battled the Bush administration on privacy abuses involving libraries under the Patriot Act?\nA. Librarians had been monitoring the Patriot Act since the beginning. These librarians are committed to patron privacy on their computers, feeling that this privacy is as sacred as the voting booth. You should have the right to check out anything you want without the government looking over your shoulder. When the Patriot Act was put in place, librarians realized right away that the government could rifle through your records without you even knowing about it. The attorney general at the time said they were hysterical, that the government wasn\u2019t going to be doing that. And of course, they were all over the libraries. These librarians faced gag orders and could not even talk to their spouses about what was happening. They risked jail time.\nThe court case happened in 2005, but privacy violations are still a serious issue under the Obama administration.\nQ. There seems be a gap between some librarians who are technophobes and often a younger generation that embraces blogs and virtual libraries to promote their work. How is the use of new technology shaping up?\nA. I found that there is not really an age demarcation. There are older librarians that are as technically savvy as anyone. There are also librarians that are not comfortable with the new technology. It takes a tremendous amount of attention and commitment to embrace the new technologies.\nQ. In your book, you tapped into wide social circles of librarians. What was your experience?\nA. One of the great things about these librarians is that they are out there on the web. Once you stumble on one, you find a whole group of them. Librarians make up one of the most connected professions."}

But something about the way Patsy sang and Dolly sang, and even later, Alison Krauss and Kathy Mattea. There was something about that that was so much more endearing to me, so much more universal. It took a lot more chances and was more chameleon-like.

They said that the jet had only just left the gate at JFK; and also claimed that as Cho was the executive in charge of cabin service it was only \u201cnatural\u201d for her to discipline cabin crew who were not giving proper service.\nThe South Korean public was not convinced. Bloggers and the Korean press lambasted Cho for her arrogance, and took to social media to mock her for going \u201cnuts\u201d. But the response wasn\u2019t just limited to jokes \u2013 it also gave voice to deep-rooted anger in South Korea.\nWhile global interest was sparked by such trivial air rage, the story has focused attention once more on one of the most painful sores in the flesh of South Korean society: the overweening influence and brazen behaviour of a small number of \u201cchaebol\u201d \u2013 vast and powerful family conglomerates that dominate the Korean economy, from airlines to famous electronics manufacturing brands and most things in between.\nWhile Korean Air is part of international airline alliance SkyTeam, within the company, the family members exercise enormous control. In theory, no aeroplane captain should be ordered by a company executive to change course once the plane had taxied away from the gate, but the chaebol system helps explain the genuflection and servile deference shown by the steward, and the aircraft\u2019s captain \u2013 employees who could not risk any defiance.\nThe South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced on Thursday that it was summoning Cho for questioning over the incident. She may also face criminal charges for forcing the plane to return to the gate after a complaint was filed on Wednesday by the People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, an influential South Korean pressure group.\nBut much more humiliating still for Cho, her father \u2013 her boss at Korean Air and the patriarch of the chaebol \u2013 publicly apologised for his daughter\u2019s behaviour, bowing deeply, calling it foolish, and going so far as to say that he regretted not having raised her better.\nCho resigned \u2013 or was forced to resign \u2013 in ignominy from her position at the airline.

Lewis, one of the 20th century\u2019s foremost defenders of Christianity \u2014 comes nearly on the heels of \"The Passion of the Christ,\" 2004&apos;s blood-drenched Mel Gibson film that proved deeply religious moviegoers could be a force to be reckoned with at the box office.\nAnd Disney\u2019s dual-track marketing scheme \u2014 selling the movie to both Christian and mainstream audiences \u2014 certainly means that the House of Mouse is taking the subgroup seriously.\nBut people connected with the film, experts and observers seem to agree that when it comes to the religious aspect of the movie, the lion that roared is really just a paper tiger \u2014 especially Disney, which risks its film becoming labeled a niche, \u201cChristian\u201d movie and losing the mainstream audience.\nTheologians said that Disney\u2019s marketing effort has seemed to strike the right balance between appealing to the mainstream and acknowledging the Narnia books\u2019 Christian roots.\nAnd so did those outside the Christian community who had denounced Gibson\u2019s film.\n\u201cI think some people are trying to make this into another \u2018Passion\u2019 thing, but the objection to \u2018The Passion\u2019 wasn\u2019t that it was Christian but that it had some very violent anti-Jewish imagery,\u201d said J.J.

So even though I was going through hardship - up and down - but still when I get to see the audience and I get to perform and I get that energy. That energy keeps me going.

Young people, however, are not drinking the Kool-Aid.\nIf you won the jackpot today, would you go back to work tomorrow? The question may sound absurd, but there are plenty of lottery winners who have done just that. There's a waitress in Florida who went back to making $400 per week the day after winning $1 million, a German salesman who was told that he won $27 million only to tell the shopkeeper that he didn't have time to chat because he was late for work and a British shelf stacker who returned to her job at Walmart after winning $3.9 million. This seemingly strange phenomenon becomes less strange once we admit what we all know: work isn't just about paying the bills.\nMaking money is important and particularly with student loans, mortgages, health issues and little people with big educational needs, the urgency increases. But, even if we took the job just to pay the bills, those 40+ work hours add up to more than just dollar signs, they make up a large part of our identity. Hence why everyone's favorite cocktail party question is, so what do you do?\nEven if you're not the cocktail party type (and I'll admit that I'm more of a PBR girl myself), all those hours are bound to affect you. Maybe you spend the best years of your life thinking about how to provide excellent customer service at Walmart, maybe you spend them manipulating derivatives on Wall Street. Maybe you love all your co-workers, maybe you don't. Whatever flavors go into your work world, you're not going to get out of there without a little tinge on your teeth.\nMost Americans report being satisfied with their jobs. Young people, however, are not drinking the Kool-Aid. We consistently report low rates of job satisfaction and seem to change careers as though it's, well, our job. This might be because there simply aren't many jobs to go around, let alone good ones. It might be because we're young and don't really understand what it means to pay the bills since most of us still bum off our parents. But I think it's something deeper.\nIn the past 30 years technology and globalization have revolutionized the way that we interact with each other, burning through any semblance of a boundary between our jobs and the rest of our lives to the point where many of us can, quite literally, work from anywhere. Even in Niger, West Africa, one of the poorest countries in the world, my Nigerien friends regularly send me emails from their smart phones. The potential to transform our world is limitless and it is at our fingertips. All we need to do is dream.\nImagine a world where each of us strive to live up to our highest potential. To work on things that really matter, not just to our bank accounts, but to other human beings and to our planet. Naive? Maybe, but the idea of meaningful work is rapidly gaining traction, with over 500 companies certified as \"B Corps,\" a type of corporation that uses business to solve social and environmental problems, and the rise of a new talent agency called Rework that focuses specifically on helping people find jobs that create impact.\nWhile the impact or \"social enterprise\" sector may still be small, it's likely to grow as more people express interest in finding meaningful work. As one of the founders of Rework, Nathaniel Koloc, told me, \"For many people, work becomes meaningful when there is positive impact associated"}
{"idx": "28035", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Rose bushes need between 1 to 2 inches of water a week.\nKnowing how and when to water rose bushes is important, as water drives a plant's growth and the development of flowers. A lack of water, particularly during times of rapid growth, will weaken a plant and make it more susceptible to disease and insect damage. When using an irrigation system to water rose bushes, knowing how much water and when to apply it can make all the difference.\nGenerally speaking, rose bushes need about an inch or two of water per week during the growing season. The hotter it is, the sandier the soil and the more sun the bushes get, the more water they will need. If Mother Nature doesn't provide adequate slow and steady rainfall periodically, then you will have to. Brief spells of heavy downpours will not be sufficient as the soil cannot adequately retain that much water.\nThe best method of providing water to your rose bushes is one that allows you to water the bushes deeply and infrequently, generally once or twice a week, depending on the weather. If you water your roses often and with less water, you discourage proper growth. Deep and infrequent watering encourages roots to grow deeper in search of water, while shallow, frequent watering keeps feeder roots concentrated in the first few inches of soil, where they quickly dry out.\nIf you only have a few bushes in a small garden, watering by hand with a hose works well provided you water deeply and infrequently. If you have numerous plants, installing a drip or bubble irrigation system is definitely the way to go. Placing a bubbler under each bush and setting a timer to deliver 1 to 2 inches of water per week per rose bush is ideal. You can adjust the 1 to 2 inches of water, based on your average slow and steady rainfall.\nOne advantage to bubble irrigation and even a soaker hose is that these methods deliver water directly to the soil surrounding the plant where it can be quickly absorbed by the plant's roots without splashing. Using an overhead sprinkler, watering can or even a hose is not only inaccurate, but delivering water overhead is wasteful because of evaporation. It also becomes a problem if you live in a wet climate where black-spot can cause fungal problems \u2013 you don't want to water the foliage any more than absolutely necessary as the spores germinate on wet leaves.\nLiles, Valerie. \"Rate of Flow of Bubble Irrigation Systems for Rose Bushes.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/rate-flow-bubble-irrigation-systems-rose-bushes-68266.html.

With the aid of a hidden camera, I ventured to MSNBC\u2019s book party Tuesday night to tear the lid off of this den of open bars and Wagyu beef hors d\u2019oeuvres.

At the same time, the company will unleash a slew of devices that use the new OS. But the question is whether the improvements in this new version will help BlackBerry retain and possibly regain popularity among mobile device users, including those in public-sector agencies.\nI recently had the opportunity to preview BlackBerry 10 at RIM\u2019s offices in Washington, D.C., and although I don\u2019t know what the future holds for BlackBerry, I can say that it will give the competition something to think about.\nNow, of course, public sector users would expect the new BlackBerry to have top-notch security, and it will be every bit as secure as its users are accustomed to; it recently gained FIPS 140-2 certification, which is important for government users. But this time around RIM is concentrating on the user experience. The company wants customers to be able to use the phone for tasks they would normally have to go to a desktop or notebook computer to accomplish.\nFirst, the BlackBerry 10 is capable of running up to eight apps simultaneously. Switching between apps is literally a two-swipe process. When an app is in the foreground, it takes up the entire screen \u2013 no real estate is set aside for alerts or system menus. Instead, a certain swipe will make the app screen a little smaller to reveal the alerts.\nThe BlackBerry Hub is a messaging center that keeps all e-mails, tweets, calendar events and so forth all in one place. It is accessible with just swipe up from the bottom and to the right, making it effectively \u201con the left\u201d of every single pane.\nThe messaging, calendar and contacts are all completely integrated. Users can drill down from any of them to find related information. For instance, when displaying the list of attendees at an upcoming meeting, a click on an attendee\u2019s name will reveal more information, such as if he follows you on Twitter or how many degrees away he is on LinkedIn.\nRIM really made an effort to make predictive text actually work for the users. While typing on the virtual keyboard, words the system expects will hover over the next letter key in that word. If it\u2019s the right word, just swipe up when touching that key to select the word. If the user switches languages, the BlackBerry will recognize the change and start suggesting words in that language. BlackBerry bases its predictions on the user\u2019s typing history, so accuracy will improve with use.\nRIM\u2019s Balance feature will interest government network administrators. This feature sets up two profiles on the BlackBerry -- work and personal \u2013 that never interact. If a document is created in one profile, it doesn\u2019t exist when operating in the other. Sites such as BlackBerry App World will only show agency-approved apps when operating in the work profile, and apps installed in the personal profile are not accessible when in the work profile. With Balance a network administrator can keep a tight rein on mobile access while leaving the user free to use the BlackBerry as a personal device.\nThe BlackBerry 10\u2019s Web browser is fully HTML5-compliant. In fact, it gets a higher compliancy rating than many desktop browsers. It also includes a \u201creader mode\u201d that strips out everything from a Web page but the text, essentially allowing users to read that page like an e-book.\nIn order to revitalize"}

According to Tesco's figures \u2013 compiled by the company combined with data from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) \u2013 only 4% of bakery products and 1% of bagged salad and bananas are thrown out in shops without being sold.\nThey areas where the majority of the waste is produced are in the field, during production, and, most of all, in the home. The figures show 35% of bagged salad is thrown out by consumers at home, while 17% is lost in the field and processing losses account for another 15%.\nThe supermarket chain surely has the power to bring down waste in these areas as well.\nAs Tesco has acknowledged, ludicrously cheap promotions can lead to a lot of waste at home for perishable foods.\nWhile it might seem like a good idea to pick up several bags of salad when you spot the \"buy one get one free\" deal, your masses of salad won't look quite as appetising when it starts to go brown a few days later.\nCutting out these promotional offers would go a long way towards avoiding this situation in the first place.\nTesco has already pledged to stop offering multi-buys on larger packs, and has said it will give greater scope for customers to \"mix and match\" sale items and will introduce re-sealable bags for all salad products, which would keep them fresh in your fridge for longer.\nConservative MP Laura Sandys, who has campaigned to end food waste, said Tesco's decision to reconsider its promotions was a move in the right direction. \"Products are being sold in promotions that are bigger than people need, and single people find it difficult to buy food economically,\" she said.\nBut supermarkets also need to make sure they are cutting down on food waste further up the supply chain. About half of the wasted salad is lost before it even hits the shops, and supermarkets need to do a lot more to reduce waste in the field and during processing.\n\"There's often a flurry of interest in the house waste side of things, but a lot of the waste is all the way along the supply chain, starting with agreements with farmers,\" said Kerry McCarthy, MP for Bristol East, who last year put forward a bill to force supermarkets to donate excess food to charity.\nShe said the formation of the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) \u2013 a new watchdog that oversees the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers \u2013 was an important step to stop supermarkets telling their suppliers to throw away excess product.\nThis routinely happens when supermarkets refuse to take perfectly edible items from suppliers for \"cosmetic\" reasons, according to Niki Charalampopoulou, campaigns and policy manager for Feeding the 5000, a global campaign to reduce food waste"}

He was referring to the South Korean media\u2019s approach toward Kim when he ascended to the head of North Korea in 2011.\nThe expert also pointed out that Kim Jong-un likes to demonstrate his power and his position more publically compared to his late father and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, which could be why he released photos that showed him signing orders for the latest nuclear test.\nAccording to Nam, Kim Jong-un was tapped by his father to lead North Korea after Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke in August 2008. He was chosen, despite being the late North Korean leader\u2019s youngest offspring, because the eldest Kim Jong-nam had spent most of his life overseas. Kim Jong-il also ruled out his middle child Kim Jong-chul, who reportedly suffers from hormone imbalance. Kim Jong-nam was killed in Malaysia earlier this year in what appears to be an assassination organized by North Korean agents."}

Throughout, he wears memorable costumes and performs moves from some of his career-defining moments.\nThe film, directed by Seb Edwards at Academy Films, opens on John himself playing the first notes of \u201cYour Song\u201d in a quiet living room, but then turns back in time as we see him as an '80s superstar, performing in stadium concerts in the' 70s, hitting the keys in a pub, appearing at a school concert as a boy and finally, as a young child being thrilled to receive his grandmother\u2019s piano as a Christmas gift.\nThe tagline is \"more than just a gift\" and the message of the ad is that a gift can alter the course of someone\u2019s life (an idea we\u2019ve also coincidentally seen this year from online retailer Very). While not perhaps as overtly heartwarming as some of John Lewis' past oeuvre, the nostalgic spot will likely tugs at hearts aplenty, especially those of his fans. A biopic of the singer is due to come out next year, but John Lewis said the ad had no connection to that.\nCraig Inglis, Partner and Customer Director, John Lewis & Partners, comments in a statement: \u201cThink back to all of the Christmases that you have enjoyed over the years--I\u2019m sure there is one very special gift that stands out above all others. That\u2019s the magical feeling we wanted to bring to life this year. The ad tells the story of why Elton\u2019s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u2019ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\"\nAccording to John Lewis, the idea was whittled down from over 300 scripts, and Elton John agreed to appear very early on in the process. His management company, Rocket Management, was involved with the casting of the actors who play him.\nTo accompany the ad, John Lewis is reusing a mock-up of the set in its Oxford Street store, where customers will be able to play a grand piano, sit in a '70s-style recording studio and listen to original recordings, and try on some recreations of his trademark costumes. There will also be pianos available to play throughout stores, and John Lewis will sell pianos for the first time in several years. Elton John memorabilia will be available to buy in stores.\nAs well as \u201cYour Song,\u201d several other Elton John tunes will be used in a series of shorter ads focusing on gifting: for example, \u201cI\u2019m Still Standing\u201d will be used in an ad for an espresso machine. A musical light show will be projected from the shop\u2019s Oxford Street windows every 30 minutes from 4pm, performing Elton John\u2019s Christmas classic, \u201cStep Into Christmas.\"\nThe retailer teased the ad by altering its signage yesterday to read simply \u201cJohn\u201d (the \u201cLewis will reappear tomorrow) and by changing the soundtracks on ITV shows such as \u201cCoronation Street\u201d to a piano version.\nJohn Lewis would not comment on the cost of the ad, but said the 10-million-pound figure which had been speculated when news of Elton John\u2019s appearance leaked out this summer was \"wildly inaccurate,\""}

This isn\u2019t just a rehash of Party Down or Parks and Recreation. Carter is confident yet vulnerable. Having your parents separate in such a traumatic way \u2013 at your ninth birthday party \u2013 changed him forever and while he seems to be put together on the surface, he\u2019s broken underneath. That pain is on his face in every scene. Which is why when his brother Trey (Duke) decides to get married, things begin to bubble up that Carter can\u2019t stop. He tries his hardest to deal with it but it sets off a chain of events that will challenge his divorced parents, his girlfriend (Winstead), his former therapist (Lynch) and much more.\nWhen a script is as well-thought out as this one is, a great cast will only elevate it. While Scott easily carries the load, O\u2019Hara and Jenkins are simply hilarious as his parents. Lynch is much more subdued than we\u2019re used to seeing her, same for Duke, and both Winstead and Alba play characters that\u2019ll challenge Carter to his core.\nAll of that is aided by a directorial style and script that forgoes many traditional Hollywood tropes, letting the audience most of the work. Several plot points and reveals are shown, not told, and if you\u2019re not paying attention, important pieces could be missed. The film also demands you not only laugh, but think and feel, especially with an ending that\u2019s so poignant and perfect, I can\u2019t believe they pulled it off.\nThere\u2019s very little bad to say about A.C.O.D.

Luckily, the movie depicted a special robot-killing weapon to defeat the evil robot: the sabot round. In fact, the sabot round is a very real weapon that has been used in both Iraq wars. But because of its dangerous health effects, the ongoing use of this weapon may constitute a war crime.\nThe sabot round is nothing more than a lightweight frame containing a solid, two-foot-long dart made from depleted uranium, or DU. Forged from leftover nuclear metal ore waste, DU is incredibly dense, allowing it to penetrate most conventional armor, and it is used primarily to penetrate tanks. It\u2019s also pyrophoric, which means the dart spontaneously ignites on contact with air, producing intense heat. A single DU sabot round will punch through a tank and engulf the interior in molten plasma. The resulting conflagration often burns hot enough to ignite the enemy vehicle\u2019s ammunition and fuel, completely destroying it. For the Department of Defense, DU is cheap and readily available: The Cold War left the United States with about half a million tons of the stuff.\nThe thing the DoD often doesn\u2019t like to talk about is that depleted uranium is both radioactive and toxic, putting its use in violation of some basic tenets of the Geneva Conventions. Defenders of DU (mainly the United States and Britain) have argued that it\u2019s perfectly safe to hold a sabot round in your hand. That\u2019s probably true, but when a sabot round hits its target, much of the shell aerosolizes into a ceramic dust that can enter the soil. This dust contaminates food and water supplies and can be inhaled or absorbed into the body through open wounds. A variety of critics, including veterans\u2019 organizations, independent researchers, and the European Parliament, have charged that this dust has created serious health problems for exposed soldiers and civilians. If it\u2019s as toxic as they say, then the use of DU violates at least three international laws.\nThe Hague Convention of 1907 prohibits the use of \u201cpoison or poisoned weapons,\u201d and DU could fit that description. A recent study on rats shows that exposure to depleted uranium can cause damage to the central nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive systems. This latter effect has been cited by independent researchers as the cause of unusually high rates of infertility and birth defects in both Gulf War veterans and civilians in Iraq, where U.S. forces fired over 300 tons of DU ammunition. A 2005 study concluded that the risk to both groups from DU exposure was nominal, though the report admitted to \u201cfairly large calculational uncertainties.\u201d Ultimately, not enough research has been done on DU\u2019s effect on human populations. Despite admitting that thousands of Gulf War veterans were exposed to the substance, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has tested fewer than 100.\nDU is a radioactive substance. The Defense Department points out that alpha waves emitted by DU are stopped by human skin. But on the battlefield a DU weapon can easily enter the body as dust or metal shrapnel. Under international law, this puts DU weapons like the sabot round into the same category with nuclear and chemical weapons that cause \u201cindiscriminate destruction.\u201d A 199"}

When we started the awards, our goal was to celebrate the best wines in the country by taking a yearly snapshot in a week-long tasting that initially separated the ordinary from the good and later in the week the good from the best.\nEighteen years down the road, the vision Lawrason and I had for the awards is finally coming to fruition.\nTo find the best, you first require the best wines in the competition. Because entrants are never published, only winners, you might be surprised to learn that many highly touted international competitions seldom attract the wines thought to be the best of the region or the country.\nThe issue for wineries often repeated to me is, if you are thought to be the best, why risk a poor showing in any competition?\nThe nationals began like that. but over the years we have cultivated a culture of trust between the wineries and the competition.

Indeed opinion amongst local residents and experts seems to be divided on whether the cubs can survive on their own or not yet.\nGregor Raudvere, in whose yard the cubs made their appearance, said that not only was it a surprise but that the cubs also refused to go: ''We took them back into the forest, but they came straight back to our yard,'' he said.\nThey were also quite amenable to being hand-fed by people.\nLocal hunter Vahur Jalak said that whilst the cubs can roam around on their own, they aren't quite old enough to do that for any great length of time without their mother.\nFellow hunter and nature expert Jaan \u00c4rmus added that it is unlikely that any zoo or similar is likely to take the cubs and that nature must be allowed to take its course.\n''We made a few calls but nobody was interested in taking the cubs,'' he explained, including local families.\n''They are always cute when they are young,'' he pointed out, whilst stating that since they are just coming into the age when they may be able to cope alone, the less contact the cubs have with humans the better.\n''The best thing we can do is return the cubs to the forest,'' he went on.\nAnother local resident, Daniel Malter, stated that he had already seen one of the cubs, or at least A bear cub, close to the sea shore near Panga village in the northwest of Saaremaa about a week ago.\n''I was walking by the sea when a cub ran out of the bushes, looked at me for a split second then dashed off back into the forest,'' he recounted.\nZoologist Mati Kaal, former director of Tallinn Zoo, however said that it is very unusual for cubs of this age to be roaming around on their own. Two hypotheses are that the cubs have grown up in the presence of, or close to, humans, and/or that the mother may have died. However they are still too young to make it on their own in the forest, he said.\n''It's possible that they have have been exposed to humans, which would have involved someone taking them from their den in winter and raising them themselves for all that time,'' Kaal said.\n''Once a bear has been taken from its den in that way there's no power in the world which can return it to its natural condition,'' he went"}
{"idx": "28061", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: App Store advertising firm adeven today unveiled a new tool for its apptrace mobile analytics platform, which provides sentiment analysis for the App Store\u2019s 24 million reviews. The free service lets users check out any title available on the App Store and see how user reviews score it in terms of three key criteria: positive feedback, addictiveness, and crash complaints. It also provides a look at how user feelings on each of those scores change over time, so that developers can monitor how changes affect reviewer sentiment.\nYou can jump on the platform and check out any app currently available to find out how users feel about a title. However, many apps don\u2019t even have reviews. One of adeven\u2019s findings is that only 257.229 apps have any reviews at all, compared to 529,895 without. Most of those tend to be positive, but only 72 percent of the reviews contain content that fits into the categories adeven is currently looking at. But those still seem to be the most interesting measures to look at initially, adeven CTO and co-founder Paul Muller told me in an interview. The task is made easier by the nature of the content, too, Muller said.\nAdeven now places a small sentiment analysis graph on any app in the App Store for which it has review data, and you can click through to see a more detailed view. That gives you a line graph detailing the app\u2019s progress in each of the sentiment categories since the app\u2019s introduction. It\u2019s a good way to see trends emerging at a glance, and even with only three measures, you can see interesting correlations in the data. For instance, checking out iBooks, it\u2019s clear that a growing number of crashes reportedly caused by PDF imports is affecting reviewer satisfaction \u2013 positive reviews have just dipped below crash reports in terms of the percentage make-up of reviews for the current version.\nAddictiveness is another unique measure in that it sometimes seems to correlate highly with positive reviews, but in other instances there is no such connection. Developers can monitor these measures to see which is more important to their download numbers. Muller also says that it seems like apps with highly positive reviews but low addictive scores may want to consider implementing sales and discounts to keep their apps charting high. That\u2019s what Gameloft seems to have done with Asphalt 7, for example.\nThe apptrace platform is free for anyone to use. It is designed mainly to help adeven gain knowledge to fold back into its paid products, as well as to provide some free added value to the app publishers it is targeting as clients. Muller says that this is just the beginning for apptrace, however, and promises that the company has many more additions planned for next year."}

They tell us what they look for when hiring and offer advice for those just embarking on a career.\nThis week, the featured alum is Sergio Floris (COM\u201912, Questrom\u201912), who leads all of Twitter\u2019s TV partnership efforts in Brazil. It\u2019s his job to develop international TV partnerships and ways Twitter can help build global communities around TV content. For instance, during last year\u2019s World Cup, Floris developed a game prediction campaign that had a sports network running hashtags along the bottom of the screen during the games, inviting viewers to tweet their game predictions. The anchors discussed the tweets on TV, drawing users into the show and making Twitter a \u201csecond screen\u201d for audience engagement.\nBefore joining Twitter, Floris was an associate at the consulting firm Booz & Company (now Strategy&, part of PwC), after working for several seasons as a field manager for the NBC reality show The Apprentice.

The fact that I had immersed myself in the digital arena was an important factor, as this is still a very young industry. After graduating, I went on to work at one of the largest strategy consulting companies (Booz & Company, now called strategy& after its sale to PricewaterhouseCoopers) and focused on media-entertainment vertical integration. This qualified me to join Twitter as someone who would lead the vertical TV partnerships in the newly formed Media Partnerships team in Brazil. I have loved Twitter since I first signed up in 2009. I saw this as a dream job opportunity, which it indeed is. I love it.\nWhat qualities do you look for in the people you hire?\nAt Twitter, cultural fit is one of the most important factors we take into account when hiring people. The company has an amazing open culture and we really protect this everyday harmony when interviewing and prospecting new hires. Apart from \u201cfitting in,\u201d we obviously consider if candidates know the platform and the digital sphere, if they are already connected in the industry, and if they have had relevant professional experiences. We also consider their educational background and whether they can challenge the company to evolve on a daily basis.\nWhat must job candidates do if they want to be considered?\nDigital understanding is a must. Also, showing passion during the interview, believe it or not, is hugely important, especially considering the cultural fit I mentioned before. Finally, candidates must always ask questions, questions, questions.

One of his lies was so gargantuan, and so obvious, that the lawmakers\u2014and the viewers watching the broadcast of these remarks\u2014could only conclude that Trump regards them as among the most gullible fools on the planet.\nHe added, \u201cThat probably clarifies things.\u201d Yes, it clarifies that nothing Trump says can be trusted.\nGo back and look at the tape or the transcript of the Helsinki press conference. Two points are clear. First, when Trump made that remark, he was not reading\u2014or misreading\u2014a formal statement; he was speaking spontaneously in response to a reporter\u2019s question.\nIn other words, what Trump actually said in that sentence is consistent with what he said in the surrounding sentences\u2014whereas the revised version of the sentence is utterly inconsistent. Another way of putting this: Trump\u2019s revised version is completely incredible.\nOne slightly positive way to look at this twisted tale might be that Trump realizes that his words were appalling; and since he is all but incapable of admitting error, he decided that the only way to deal with the bad optics was to tell a big fib. Who knows, he might have thought the fib had a decent chance of working, at least with his cherished base. Certainly similarly blatant lies have gone over well enough in the past.\nEven the usual president\u2019s daily briefing was canceled, perhaps because Trump did not want to hear about the world\u2019s reactions to his summit.\nIn fact, the U.S. intelligence agencies concluded, without dissent, that the meddling was done not just by Russians and Russians alone, but by Russian military officers directed by Putin personally. Trump stopped short of accepting that verdict.\nTrump also put a rosy glow on the whole summit with Putin without citing the slightest bit of supporting evidence\u2014mainly because none exists. The two leaders, he said, talked about \u201csome of the most pressing issues facing humanity\u201d: the Syrian civil war and its humanitarian crisis, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and nuclear proliferation. But he said nothing about what he and Trump said about these issues, much less what they plan to do about them. To the extent they were brought up at the Helsinki press conference (and they were, though only by Putin), it was clear that the two leaders disagree on all of them.\n\u201cI entered the negotiations with President Putin from a position of tremendous strength,\u201d Trump insisted, citing America\u2019s \u201cbooming\u201d economy and $700 billion military budget. But for most of the crises we face, neither the economy nor the huge military budget gives us a crucial edge.

The move to a referendum would be easier if the pro-independence parties had a very large majority.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development writes a check for the rest to PK Management.\nMany residents are mentally or physically disabled and can't get or hold jobs.\nThey're exactly the type of people that the U.S. social safety net was designed to catch.\nBut the combination of sloppy oversight, inadequate maintenance and absentee landlords has turned their lives upside down, officials say. And at the time when they're needed the most, Chattanooga's typically generous donors have closed their wallets to the refugees' plight.\n\"This is a sore subject,\" Waite said. \"Most of the people in this community do not like the Patten Towers. There are even some people who maybe feel that we shouldn't do what we are doing.\"\nThe fact is, there are few Patten Towers enthusiasts in Chattanooga. The building, sitting in the middle of Chattanooga's business district between TVA headquarters and City Hall, is a constant reminder of the city's decline in the 1970s and '80s.\nThe former Patten Hotel, which turned 100 years old in 2008, was the first skyscraper in Chattanooga when it was dedicated. Back then, it was the nicest place in town, hosting U.S. presidents, evangelists and musical acts.\nBut by 1970, the hotel was failing, along with Chattanooga's industrial output and passenger rail service. Its vintage fixtures were soon pulled off the walls and sold, and Section 8 residents were moved in. Patten Towers transformed from the pride of the Scenic City into a building that many cross the street to avoid.\nMany residents have nowhere else to go. For some, their last home was a bridge or a box. Some have families or friends, but none who will take them in.\nResident Willie"}

For another, if you place your best seeds in different parts of the grid, you ensure that solving will be enjoyable throughout the puzzle, as long as your shorter entries are also good.\nNow that was satisfying to write in, right across the middle of the grid. Cross that with the lovely and talented ELLIE KEMPER of the goofy, hilarious \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d and we\u2019re off to a great start, in my opinion. I know, there are some of us who don\u2019t appreciate pop culture, but there are just as many people who yearn to see current entries to which they can relate, and these two entries are fresh and fun. Right next to Ms. KEMPER is the older SILVER ARROW Mercedes, as well as Sherlock Holmes\u2019s DEERSTALKER HAT. So don\u2019t say that there isn\u2019t something for everyone here.\nAfter the seed entries are placed, the rest of the grid needs to be filled, and Mr. McCarty seems to have a good eye for late-week fill. I did not know the word SEMIBREVE, for example, but now I do: it\u2019s the British term for what we Yanks call a musical whole note. For further proof that we don\u2019t speak the same language as the British, please note that they call their quarter note a \u201ccrotchet,\u201d which is a fun word that is both hilarious and has absolutely nothing to do with measurements as we Americans know them. If I\u2019m reading this correctly, two quavers would equal one crotchet, and four crotchets equal a hemiliter. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never been great with the metric system.\nAnd then there is the cluing. A good Saturday clue, in my opinion, will make your heart sink a little. It will take some work, there will be a point at which you hold your head in your hands, and then you will solve it. Hands up if you are someone who engages in the sport of fencing. You are most likely the only people who will know 55A (\u201cFifth of eight parrying positions in fencing\u201d) right off the bat. But it\u2019s the only fair way to clue the word QUINTE, which is itself a rare word to see in a puzzle. But the crossings are kind in that section, and by the time you work your way across, you\u2019ve learned that QUINTE is a fencing position. Feel free to work that into conversation at your next staff meeting or cocktail party. Don\u2019t be alarmed if people move their seats.\nSo, tl;dr: By the time you get to Saturday puzzles, relinquish the idea that you won\u2019t have to look anything up. There\u2019s no shame in learning something new. Savor the seed entries and look at the fill around it: Are these satisfying entries to write in? Do more than a few clues make you smile or curse the constructor and editors? Then you\u2019ve had a good time, my friends, and that\u2019s what working your way up to solving the Saturday puzzles is all about.\n\u25a0 1A: It took me a while before I realized that the clue was about the ground kind of meal rather than one of the daily meals you eat.

As Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) used to say, the bill was constructed like a three-legged stool\u2014the legs were: employer sanctions against those who hired undocumented persons illegally; a national ID card; and amnesty for those who were in the country without documentation. The idea was you needed all the legs in order for the stool to stand.\nThe debates we had then over the bill seem almost quaint compared to the heated\u2014sometimes racist\u2014battles that are taking place today over immigrants and immigration reform. As an Hispanic-American, I am very sensitive to the nasty comments being thrown around by Donald Trump about immigration from south of our border. This kind of ignorance is both wrong and dangerous. It\u2019s wrong because it fails to take into account that immigrants make valuable contributions to our economy, and dangerous because scapegoating any group for the problems of society at large splits us apart as a nation at a time when we need to come together.\nAnd we must have an amnesty program that provides a path to citizenship.\nHillary Clinton has said that as President she will introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill that will address the issues I believe are fundamental to such reform, and that will bring immigrants out of the shadows and into the mainstream of American society. Inclusion is the best way to ensure a more secure and economically stable future. Those who feel empowered and part of the American dream are more inclined to be productive citizens and residents.\nUnfortunately, getting support for an immigration reform bill will be particularly difficult in the hostile atmosphere created by Trump. It took us several years in the 1980\u2019s to come together and pass a bill that attempted to address that generation\u2019s immigration issues. As a participant in those debates, it was clear to me then, and it is just as clear now, that this must be a bipartisan effort.\nThose were different, more civil times. I did not always agree with Senator Alan Simpson, but I always respected him. I knew we could have a conversation about where we could agree and work together. We understood that we had the same goal, to deal with an issue that was important to all Americans in a way that protected the rights and addressed the concerns of all groups.\nMuch has changed over the last 30 years when Simpson-Mazzoli was signed into law. Today, a merchant of hate and fear is trying to define the debate on immigration reform. The lack of civility and the racist rhetoric by Trump has made immigration reform very difficult today. It has made Hispanics and others victims rather than participants and a source of support for reform. Building a wall doesn\u2019t solve a problem, it creates one. It is one thing to secure our borders, but it is another to treat a group of people as the enemy.\nThere is also a reality check that has to come into play. We are not going to round up more than 11 million undocumented immigrants and deport them. That is a chilling thought. Rather, let\u2019s think about ways to include immigrants, and make them part of our future.\nThe good news is Clinton has proven she understands how to work with the other side of the aisle"}

Two New Jersey developers have the building under contract for purchase.\nTwo investors are poised to acquire the old Boomerang Lodge property in Aspen, but only if the City Council is willing to accept their changes proposed for the development.\nMarshall Tycher and Eric Witmondt formed ME Aspen Ventures One LLC in February. They have the property under contract to buy from Aspen FSP ABR LLC, which paid $13.5 million for the land and its aging lodge in June 2005. The next year most of the lodge was demolished to make way for a development that has yet to happen.\nOn Monday, Tycher introduced himself to City Council in the first round of talks about amending approvals the redevelopment earned in 2006. Tycher told a reporter after the meeting that he and his partner plan to buy the property only if they can lock in the new approvals. He declined to reveal how much the 27,000-square-foot property \u2014 of which only the historically designated east wing exists \u2014 is under contract for purchase.\nLocated at 500 W. Hopkins Ave., the property has gone through several iterations for redevelopment. Litigation by neighbors thwarted plans to convert it into affordable housing. That prompted the owners, who had struggled to get financing because of the Great Recession, in 2015 to revert back to the 2006 approvals. Those approvals allow for 47 lodge keys, 29 lodge units, five free-market residential units and two affordable-housing units.\nThe current owner received two extensions of vested rights to build the lodge because of the Great Recession. The first extension was granted by the City Council in 2009, the second in 2015.\nNow Tycher and Witmondt, who was not at the meeting, are seeking the council\u2019s blessing to increase the average unit size from 812 square feet to 1,040 square feet. With the rooms becoming predominantly suites under the new proposal, they would range in size from 800 square feet to 1,732 square feet.\nTycher and Witmondt also want to reduce the number of lodge units from the approved number of 29 to 23. The number of lodge keys, 47, would remain the same.\nThe city\u2019s deputy planning director, Jennifer Phelan, is recommending that the lodge units do not exceed 1,500 square feet to allow room for other lodge amenities such as gathering space.\nMayor Steve Skadron said he would want assurances from the developers that the units are not converted into condominiums.\n\u201cIf I had the authority, I would require a deed restriction of the rooms to prevent conversion of lodge rooms into condos, but we can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to discuss at the public hearing conditions of approval that speaks\u201d to prevent that.\nThe prospective buyers plan to keep the approved floor area of 46,140 square feet and underground parking, which all meet Aspen\u2019s newer, revised land-use code, Phelan told the council.

I\u2019ve seen it up close.\nIn 2008, I was on Wall Street, working at Lehman Brothers, when the global economic meltdown hit. The next thing I knew, I was out on the street, holding a box with all my office possessions in it, looking back at the building and asking a single question: What just happened?\nOne of the key lessons that experience taught me was that disruptive change happens really fast, without warning, when and where people least expect it.\nIn fact, just this week, it happened again. in late March, Apple introduced the Apple Card into the U.S. market, a new app-driven credit card backed by Goldman Sachs. It has the potential to completely upend what has been a stable and highly profitable product for traditional banks.\nCanada, without a doubt, is next. The question is, will our banks be ready for a competitor the size of Apple? A competitor that has more cash on hand than the combined market capitalization of three of Canada\u2019s top-five banks.\nOn the face of it, our banking sector is very strong. Canada\u2019s banks made close to $100 billion in pre-tax profits in 2017 and employ more than a quarter-million people. That kind of success, year in and year out, can begin to feel inevitable. If success is assured, why do anything differently?\nBecause success is not assured. Other sectors \u2014 such as media, retail, the taxi industry and many more \u2014 have already been disrupted. I would argue that the Canadian banking sector is the next in line for a massive disruption brought on by digital innovation in financial technology. When the dust settles, some Canadian banks could find themselves looking a lot less like Amazon and a lot more like Sears.\nWhen it comes to moving to digital banking, the traditional banks are at a disadvantage owing to their legacy technology, culture, and reliance on service fees and high margin products. FinTechs and companies like Apple \u2014 who are digital natives \u2014 can adapt, change and move with the market much faster than the big banks.\nTo service the digital economy and make space for healthy competition in financial service, banks and regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere have already begun to make the bet on FinTech. To understand where Canada is at, look at one stat. There are 4,000 FinTech companies in the U.S. There are about 160 in Canada. In Asia and Europe, the numbers are similar.\nSo, let\u2019s play a scenario out. When Canadian consumers see their American counterparts making a credit card purchase with an intuitive, easy-to-use app on their smartphone, they\u2019re not going to say, \u201cOh, good for them.\u201d They\u2019re going to say, \u201cI want that, too.\u201d We\u2019d better be ready to give it to them, or someone else will.\nThat\u2019s why FinTech is the future of finance. And with the arrival of the Apple Card, there is a new kid on the FinTech block \u2014 one with one billion installed customers. For now, Apple is only offering products like digital credit cards that are already in the market and, while they may be big, Apple is late to the game. It may not stay that way for long, though.\nSo, there is a storm coming \u2014 but we have a bit of time to be ready for it. The federal government needs to sit down with Canada\u2019s banks and our home-grown innovative FinTechs and work together to chart the way forward.

Reports of the phenomena by science-related websites and some newspapers and magazines relied heavily on a tweet by Erin Jordan, who told the AP that green stones \u2013 identified as olivine \u2013 were found by friends who live in Kalapana, Hawaii, about 12 miles from neighborhoods where lava fissures have opened since early May. Olivine is a common mineral found embedded in Hawaiian lava, said Cheryl Gansecki, a geologist at the University of Hawaii\u2019s Hilo campus on the Big Island.

But L.A. had neither the money nor skill to repair it.\nChai Dong-hey is sandwiched between scaffolding and a 17-ton bronze bell on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The white mask covering his mouth and nose pokes out just inches from tarnished metal.\nHis arm cocked at an 80-degree angle, the South Korean bell-master maneuvers a chisel into a crevice in an engraving of the Statue of Liberty on the bell. Then he draws out a small hammer \u2014 ready to carve out rust 37 years in the making.\nThe bell issues a soft musical reply.\nAround him, other workers take buffers to the bell under the watchful eye of a foreman. By the midmorning, city workers back in a truck to remove bags full of waste, and at noon, the team retires for a simple lunch of barley rice.\nAfter the break, Chai spreads his selection of small picks across a white cloth on the scaffolding. As he chips away at the edges of a rose, rusty brown gives way to glowing bronze.\nNearly 40 years ago, Chai's mentor spent months casting the Korean Friendship Bell at the behest of the South Korean government and sent it to San Pedro as a present for the United States' 200th birthday.\nNow Chai is helping to rescue it.\n\"My teacher always spoke of this bell as a child he had given up for adoption. He was always concerned about its well-being, but there wasn't much he could do, because it was so far away,\" Chai says through a translator. \"I always wanted to come here.\"\nThe bell may not be well known in Los Angeles, but some Koreans consider it a West Coast Statue of Liberty \u2014 a symbol of the strong ties between the U.S. and Korea.\nThen-South Korean President Park Chung-hee wanted the gift to be something special; his government spent more than $1 million to cast the bell, formally known as the Bell of Friendship, and build it a proper house.\nHe had it modeled after a famous Korean bell that dated from A.D. 771. Back then, bells were considered technological wonders that had the power to restore peace, tranquillity and healing to those who heard them.\nA Korean bell doesn't curve outward, instead dipping almost straight down like a dome to keep the sounds resonating within. A bowl placed underneath reflects sound back into the bell and through a hole ornamented by a dragon, which funnels the bell's sound out a pipe at the top.

Sarah Palin have been running one of the most appalling campaigns we can remember.\nThey have gone far beyond the usual fare of quotes taken out of context and distortions of an opponent\u2019s record \u2014 into the dark territory of race-baiting and xenophobia. Senator Barack Obama has taken some cheap shots at Mr. McCain, but there is no comparison.\nDespite the occasional slip (referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201ccronies\u201d and calling him \u201cthat one\u201d), Mr. McCain tried to take a higher road in Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate. It was hard to keep track of the number of times he referred to his audience as \u201cmy friends.\u201d But apart from promising to buy up troubled mortgages as president, he offered no real answers for how he plans to solve the country\u2019s deep economic crisis. He is unable or unwilling to admit that the Republican assault on regulation was to blame.\nNinety minutes of forced cordiality did not erase the dismal ugliness of his campaign in recent weeks, nor did it leave us with much hope that he would not just return to the same dismal ugliness on Wednesday.\nMs. Palin, in particular, revels in the attack. Her campaign rallies have become spectacles of anger and insult. \u201cThis is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America,\u201d Ms. Palin has taken to saying.\nHer demagoguery has elicited some frightening, intolerable responses. A recent Washington Post report said at a rally in Florida this week a man yelled \u201ckill him!\u201d as Ms. Palin delivered that line and others shouted epithets at an African-American member of a TV crew.\nMr. McCain\u2019s aides haven\u2019t even tried to hide their cynical tactics, saying they were \u201cgoing negative\u201d in hopes of shifting attention away from the financial crisis \u2014 and by implication Mr. McCain\u2019s stumbling response.\nWe certainly expected better from Mr. McCain, who once showed withering contempt for win-at-any-cost politics. He was driven out of the 2000 Republican primaries by this sort of smear, orchestrated by some of the same people who are now running his campaign.\nAnd the tactic of guilt by association is perplexing, since Mr. McCain has his own list of political associates he would rather forget. We were disappointed to see the Obama campaign air an ad (held for just this occasion) reminding voters of Mr. McCain\u2019s involvement in the Keating Five savings-and-loan debacle, for which he was reprimanded by the Senate. That episode at least bears on Mr. McCain\u2019s claims to be the morally pure candidate and his argument that he alone is capable of doing away with greed, fraud and abuse.\nIn a way, we should not be surprised that Mr. McCain has stooped so low, since the debate showed once again that he has little else to talk about. He long ago abandoned his signature issues of immigration reform and global warming; his talk of \u201cvictory\u201d in Iraq has little to offer a war-weary nation; and his Reagan-inspired ideology of starving government and shredding regulation lies in tatters on Wall Street.\nBut surely, Mr. McCain and his team can come up with a better answer to that problem than inciting more division, anger and hatred."}

Unexploded \u201cduds\u201d pictured at the attack site bear similarities to Brazilian-manufactured cluster bombs Saudi Arabia is known to have used in the past.\n\u201cBecause cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons, their use is prohibited by customary international humanitarian law. In fact, nearly 100 states have totally banned their production, stockpiling, transfer and use, in recognition of the unique and lasting harm they cause,\u201d said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at Amnesty International.\nIn addition to killing and injuring civilians when they are initially used, many submunitions fail to explode upon impact and continue to pose a risk to the lives of anyone who comes into contact with them for years. The Saudi Arabia-led coalition must immediately cease their use and all sides should publicly commit never to deploy cluster munitions and agree to join the global Convention on Cluster Munitions.\nThe cluster munition attack was carried out at around noon on 27 October 2015 in a residential area of Ahma, approximately 10km north-west of al-Talh in Sahar directorate, near Sa\u2019da city. Ahma is approximately 40km south of the border with Saudi Arabia.\nA local activist who visited the site several hours after the attack found three unexploded submunitions around 20m apart, one in the field of a local farm, another near a greenhouse and the third next to a mosque. The nearest military objective known to Amnesty International is a market in al-Talh, approximately 10km to the south-east, which is known to sell weapons and has been targeted by airstrikes on at least five different occasions since the start of the Saudi Arabia-led bombardment campaign in March.\nEyewitnesses described how, despite the complete absence of military aircraft, a series of rockets screamed across the sky and exploded in mid-air, followed by dozens of explosions on the ground. These accounts and the remnants found on the ground are consistent with the use of cluster munitions fired via surface-to-surface rockets, using a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS).\nAccording to medical personnel treating the patients, one of the injured, 25-year-old Abdelaziz Abd Rabbu is in a critical condition with shrapnel injuries to the abdomen and chest.\nAbdelbari Hussein, 22, another civilian injured in the attack, told Amnesty International: \u201cI was sitting in my shop when the attack happened.

However, the association between pressure injury development and rehabilitation outcomes hasn't been examined previously.\nUsing data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation, she examined the records for nearly 500,000 Medicare patients discharged between January 2013 and September 2014 -- after this mandated measure of quality was implemented.\nThe study was published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\n\"We looked at how good a proxy measure of quality the new or worsened pressure ulcer measure was, in particular to see if it was associated with poorer outcomes for rehabilitation patients.\nWe found that it was indeed associated with lower quality outcomes: less gain in function during treatment, and lower likelihood of leaving rehab to go to a community setting,\" said Jo Freudenheim, the paper's senior author and chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health in the UB School of Public Health and Health Professions.\n\"The focus of this paper is on an important question for the regulation of medical care.\nHow do you measure whether someone is getting good care? In this case we were focused on the inpatient rehab facilities,\" Freudenheim said.\n\"We looked at one of the ways that quality is measured as part of the ACA--whether patients get a new pressure ulcer during their stay or, if they have one already, if it gets worse during their stay.\"\nWhile outcomes were poorer for those with new or worsened pressure ulcers, more than half of these patients were able to be discharged to a community setting.\n\"A pressure injury prior to admission or greater likelihood of developing worse pressure injury are not appropriate grounds for denial of access to inpatient rehabilitation care,\" the researchers write.\nCompared to the control group, patients with a new or worsened bedsore tended to have a lower change score on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), a basic indicator of patient disability, and to have, on average, longer rehabilitation stay.\nIn this study, about 1 percent of patients experienced new or worsened bed sores during their rehabilitation stay.\nBedsores, also known as pressure sores, develop when the skin and the underlying tissues experience prolonged pressure.\nPrevention is better than cure holds true in the case of bedsores.

Those keeping up with the latest Harry Potter news know that plans are well underway to bring an adaptation of J.K. Rowling's reference guide Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to the big screen. Filming is expected to start this summer, and it looks as though the casting process has begun.\nUPDATE: SnitchSeeker is now reporting that, according to a source at Warner Bros, this casting news is a false rumor. We'll keep you posted if there are any further updates.\nBelow is the original article.\nActing-Auditions.org posted the casting update, which confirms that shooting for Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them will take place in the U.K. and New York, starting in August 2015. Submissions for the cast are now being accepted. In order to be eligible for the cast or crew, you must have the necessary work permit documents to work in London and the U.K. Acting-Auditions provides additional details on that, as well as the address for Fiona Weir Casting, which is where hopefuls can send their headshots and resumes.\nUnfortunately, no details about the roles being cast were specified, which leaves us in the dark about the characters for this film, beyond Newt Scamander. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is neither prequel nor sequel, but technically an \"extension of the wizarding world,\" centering on magizoologist Newt Scamander, the man who -- seventy years or so before the events of the original Harry Potter series -- wrote the titular textbook, which would go on to be studied by Harry, Ron, Hermione and plenty of other students at Hogwarts.\nWhile new details are scarce, we do know that the script is complete, or mostly finished. Back in November, it was reported that J.K. Rowling had finally finished the film's script. However, SnitchSkeeker recently ran an interview with Harry Potter graphic designers Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima, and from what they said, it sounds like the script may still be in development. \"But we are hoping that we are going to be full force very soon,\" Lima noted in the interview.\nWith the casting process beginning, it sounds like production is ready to start lining up talent. As exciting as it'll be to learn who is going to star in Fantastic Beasts, the eventual casting updates will also hopefully shed further light onto the plot of this story and who's involved, in terms of characters. We know that Fantastic Beasts will be set in the 1920s, and center on Newt Scamander as he conducts the necessary magical beast research to write his textbook. J.K. Rowling revealed that the story would begin in New York, and from the sound of it, that's where Newt will remain for the duration of the (first) film.\nPutting Newt in America could limit the possibility that he would come into contact with witches and wizards who are either directly or indirectly connected to the Harry Potter books. But I'm still hopeful that Dumbledore will -- at the very least -- make an appearance. The eventual headmaster of Hogwarts was alive and kicking in the 1920s.

Scientists previously thought that brown dwarfs have too few dusty particles, moving too quickly, for this process to happen.\n\"Solid grains of that size shouldn't be able to form in the cold outer regions of a disk around a brown dwarf, but it appears that they do.

The wavelengths of light emitted tend to be the same as the size of the grains, or smaller.\nThe astronomers compared how bright the disk was in two wavelengths: 0.035 inches (0.89 millimeters) and 0.13 inches (3.2 mm). The brightness dropped off less than expected when observing at the larger millimeter size.\nScientists took this to mean that some of the grains surrounding the brown dwarf must be at least 0.039 inches (1 mm) in size.\nALMA is still partially under construction, and will be finished next year, but it began work in 2011using a partial array of dishes. When the radio telescope is completed, the research team added, scientists will be able to make observations with greater precision.\n\"We will soon be able to not only detect the presence of small particles in discs, but to map how they are spread across the circumstellar disc and how they interact with the [carbon monoxide] gas that we've also detected in the disc,\" Ricci said. \"This will help us better understand how planets come to be.\""}

{"idx": "28135", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: How Does a Heat Pump Work - What is a Heat Pump?\nOf all the mechanical systems installed in homes today, few are as mystifying as the heat pump. It\u2019s not a furnace, but it can warm your home. And it\u2019s not an air conditioner, but it can cool your home. How\u2019s that possible? Will it save you money? Is it effective at any temperature? Is it better than a gas furnace?\nHere\u2019s a brief explanation of exactly what a heat pump is and how it works.\nSimply stated, a heat pump is an all-in-one heating and cooling device that\u2019s designed to keep your home comfortable all year round. It consists of two main components: an indoor air handler and an outdoor heat pump, which is similar to a central air-conditioning unit. Inside the pump is a compressor that absorbs and then releases heat. In summer, the heat pump operates much like a central air-conditioner, absorbing heat from inside your home and expelling it outdoors. In winter, the process reverses and the pump absorbs heat from the outside air and delivers it indoors to heat your home.\nIf heat pumps are so wonderful, why doesn\u2019t every home have one?\nThe amazing thing about a heat pump is that it can extract heat from cold air, because even cold air contains some heat. For example, if you go outside in 35-degree-Fahrenheit weather, it feels cold. But, it feels a lot warmer than if the temperature is 20 degrees, right? That\u2019s 15 degrees of heat that aren\u2019t in the air. It\u2019s that ability to absorb heat from air\u2014even cold air\u2014that makes heat pumps reliable and much more energy efficient than single-source systems that only produce either cool or warm air. A heat pump doesn\u2019t generate heat from scratch, which requires quite a bit of energy. Instead, it simply moves heat from one place to another.\nYou might be wondering: If heat pumps are so wonderful, why doesn\u2019t every home have one? Heat pumps are ideal for regions with moderate climates, but are less efficient in areas with long, frigid winters. As a general rule, heat pumps are effective at temperatures around 30 degrees or so. Any colder than that and the pump will struggle to extract heat, causing it to run much less efficiently.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean a heat pump is never a viable option in a cold climate. In cold-weather regions that require a lot of heat, the heat pump can be coupled with a gas furnace, something known as a dual-fuel system. When the weather turns cool, the heat pump produces heat and uses the furnace to blow warm air throughout the house. In very cold weather, when the heat pump can\u2019t extract the necessary Btu, it automatically shuts down and the furnace does all the heating.\nIn predominantly hot-weather regions, where heating isn\u2019t as important, the heat pump can be paired with an air handler. In this arrangement, the heat pump heats or cools the air and the air handler circulates it throughout the house.\nFor a lot of people, a heat pump can be a good way to save money on heating and cooling. If you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s appropriate for your home, contact a local licensed heating-and-cooling contractor."}

To save users from the tedious task of entering the 16 characters of their credit card numbers, four for date, and three for CCV number, the Web Payments API lets Websites pull numbers stored in browsers.\nOlejnik, security and privacy researcher, writes that even without a full privacy assessment, it was easy to discover some serious vectors for misuse: fingerprinting, a frequent interest of Olejnik's; and in Chrome, he found a way to reliably detect users in \u201cincognito\u201d mode, \u201ca thing that generally should not be possible\u201d.\nWeb Payments API is supported in Chrome and Edge, and is on the real-soon-now list in Firefox and WebKit.\nThe result, he writes, is that iframes could capture all the payment instruments available to an individual user.\nThe second issue, incognito detection, arises because incognito mode skips a rule applied to normal attempts at payment.\nThe vector for abuse arose, perhaps ironically, because the API's designers wanted to protect users from sites that might scam them by calling payments from multiple stored cards.\nSo the canMakePayment call can only be used once by a site requesting payment: a second call raises the exception NotAllowedError: Not allowed to check whether can make payment.\nThe slip-up is that when Olejnik tested this in Chrome, he found it didn't work properly in Incognito mode. If a user had stored values for MasterCard and Visa, for example, the second call to the API returns a \u201ctrue\u201d value for both cards.\nIt would, he wrote, behave like that for all the cards a user stored, turning \u201ca fingerprinting vector into an information leak!\u201d."}

The federal program that gives SHINE most of its funding is on the list of those that would be scrapped under the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal.\nFour days a week, hundreds of children in eastern Pennsylvania get free tutoring, a hot meal, and even the chance to help build a doghouse, thanks to a federal grant for after-school and summer learning programs. Some of their parents get access to English-as-a-second-language and GED classes.\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal 2018 seeks to slash the roughly $1.1 billion 21st Century Community Learning Center program that provides the bulk of the funding for the program and thousands of others like it. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget has argued that the program doesn\u2019t have much of an effect on student achievement.\nBut some advocates and educators beg to differ.\nThe program, which has been around since the 1990s, distributes money by formula to states to cover the cost of after-school and summer programs, primarily for children in high-poverty communities. The U.S. Department of Education has funded about 9,600 centers through the program and served 1.6 million children, according to the Afterschool Alliance, an advocacy organization in Washington.\nSecond graders Sarah Puddu, left, and Cristalee Valdez create a stop-motion movie with modeling clay and a computer during a SHINE after-school program at the Lawrence B. Morris Elementary School in Jim Thorpe, Pa. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget would eliminate the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, from which SHINE receives 82 percent of its funding.\nLike SHINE, these after-school and summer programs can offer students a range of services, including tutoring, meals, and enrichment, much of it with the help of federal funds.\nFor instance, a trio of after-school and summer programs in Cranston, R.I., that receive almost 100 percent of their funding from the 21st Century Community Learning Center program, has a science, technology, engineering, and math focus. Students might help design a greenhouse or build a solar panel from scratch. Older students add a service-learning component, working on neighborhood beautification, for example. Now, the students want to write letters to lawmakers, asking them to preserve 21st Century Community Learning Centers funding, said Ayana Crichton, the program director.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to them to see the program get cut,\u201d Crichton said. \u201cHow come we can\u2019t just talk to the president and tell him\u201d not to cut the funding? she asked.\nSome districts also get funding from the program, including the Kennett school system in southeastern Missouri, which receives a $400,000 grant. The district offers students an hour of tutoring in the morning and another hour in the afternoon, plus enrichment. Students are given a hot dinner and transportation home.\nMulvaney was asked specifically about the program during a March 16 press briefing.

Obviously, the success rate of a kick drops significantly but perhaps we should give Tucker a shot at changing our perception.\nIn ideal conditions, he can hit one from more than 80 yards out.\n\"We think about these things really specifically, if you send me out there you have a reason for it -- because they think I can make a kick,\" Tucker said Thursday on NFL Network's Good Morning Football. \"To me it doesn't matter where I just have to hit a good ball. If conditions are prime -- like last season, we opened up in Denver, the weather was warm and the field was nice, you're up in altitude so the ball just carries and in pre-game I hit the cross bar from 85. So if the situation is just prime, maybe 84 and a half yards.\"\nEighty-four yards! While most coaches wouldn't dare attempt something like that so deep in their own territory (especially special teams guru John Harbaugh) it would be insane to see kickers start lobbing Steph Curry-type shots from their own territory. As athletes continue to get stronger and more efficient, it would be a welcome addition to a game that loves high scoring. Just imagine the fantasy points alone.\nTucker said he would not, however, attempt that 85-yard kick in Denver during the winter time, which is one of the few rubs in our fantasy here.

Not the telecom giant Huawei.\nRussia is betting its geopolitical future in the Middle East on a military intervention to prop up the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But one of the biggest companies from another rising power, China, is betting that when the long civil war in Syria is over, the country will be a good place to do business.\nHuawei, one of China\u2019s richest companies and the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world, has signed an agreement with Syria to design a \u201cnational strategy for information and communication technology,\u201d including the construction of a broadband network for Internet service, the company announced this month.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Huawei has gone to work for an authoritarian Middle Eastern regime. In 2011, the company signed a contract to install equipment for Iran\u2019s largest mobile phone company as part of a system to track people\u2019s locations via their cellphone signals. And U.S. intelligence officials have long suspected that the company gives the Chinese government and its security services access to the equipment that it installs, effectively acting as an arm of the Chinese surveillance apparatus.\nThe Syria deal won\u2019t alleviate those concerns. It runs until 2020 and covers both a short- and long-term plan to repair and develop Syria\u2019s telecom infrastructure, which has been badly damaged by five years of civil war, and says that Huawei will advise the country\u2019s communications and technology ministry.\nThat assumes, of course, that there still is a ministry, or a government at all for Huawei to work with. The future of Syria and its embattled dictator is very much in doubt, despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s best efforts. So, why would a massive Chinese firm, with longstanding and deep ties to the government, take such a risk?\nIt turns out that the Middle East and North Africa are prime targets for Huawei as it seeks to expand its telecom equipment and consumer technology business\u2014think smart phones and video players. And the fact that Syria is descending into chaos doesn\u2019t intimidate Huawei\u2019s leaders.\n\u201cHuawei has a pretty strong track record in terms of infrastructure build-out, across developed and developing markets worldwide,\u201d William Plummer, a Huawei vice president and spokesman, told The Daily Beast, noting that the company works in about 170 countries and serves roughly a third of the world\u2019s population.\nHuawei has been signing deals lately in countries with little infrastructure compared to more developed nations.

Star 102 Cleveland listeners raised concerns about the lyrics of the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" with some saying the words send the wrong message in the era of the #MeToo movement.\nRadio host Glenn Anderson wrote about the station's decision to stop playing the song. \"We used to play the song 'Baby It's Cold Outside,' but you're the Christmas Executive Officer at Star 102 and you told us it's no longer appropriate,\" Anderson wrote on Tuesday. I gotta be honest, I didn't understand why the lyrics were so bad...Until I read them.\"\nThe song is sung as a duet between a man and a woman. The woman makes it clear she is worried about being with the man late into the night, while he adamantly tells her to say with him because, \"Baby, it's cold outside.\"\nAnderson shared the song's lyrics, which include lines like: \"Say, what's in this drink?\", \"I really can't stay / Baby don't hold out\" and \"I ought to say no, no, no / Mind if I move in closer?\" The woman also wonders aloud what others might think of her if she stays.\nWritten in 1944, song rose to popularity in the 1949 film \"Neptune's Daughter.\" It was sung between Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n's characters, and then by Betty Garrett and Red Skelton, who reversed the roles.\nThe song was written by popular Broadway composer Frank Loesser, who originally performed it as a humorous number with his wife. But the lyrics, in today's context, have taken on somewhat more sinister connotations. After the \"Me Too\" movement gained momentum last year, more women have been speaking out about sexual harassment and assault, and society has become more aware than ever of how widespread the problem really is. The suggestive lines in the song now drum up images of men like Harvey Weinstein, who's been accused of preventing women from leaving hotel rooms, and Bill Cosby, who was convicted of drugging and sexual assaulting a woman.\nCriticism of the lyrics in \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" actually has been building for several years. Some Twitter users called out the \"date-rapey\" undertones of the song in 2013, and a number of publications have run articles questioning the song's meaning.\nn 2014, Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl\u00e9 released a duet of the song and changed a few lyrics to be more family-friendly, with lines like, \"Maybe just a soda-pop more / Put some records on while I pour.\" They also had child actors playing the roles of the couple in the music video.\nIn his blog post, Anderson said the song has no place on today's radio, but also asked listeners what they think and included an online poll question about it.\n\"Now, I do realize that when the song was written in 1944, it was a different time, but now while reading it, it seems very manipulative and wrong,\" Anderson wrote. \"The world we live in is extra sensitive now, and people get easily offended, but in a world where #MeToo has finally given women the voice they deserve, the song has no place. What do you think?\" The results of the poll are not visible on Star 102's website."}

Right-handers Liam Hendriks and Blake Treinen represent the front and back ends of the bullpen mix A's manager Bob Melvin intends to ride into the ALDS: Hendriks is the opener, Treinen the closer.\nMelvin did not divulge his pitching plans beyond Hendriks and said his club's roster for the Wild Card game has not even been settled yet. He noted the distinction between a \"bullpen game\" -- using a series of relievers in 1- and 2-inning stints -- and using Hendriks as an opener before turning to a traditional starter for multiple innings, in the role the pioneering Tampa Bay Rays call \"the bulk guy.\" He did not commit to either strategy for Wednesday's game. His best starter this season, Sean Manaea, endured season-ending shoulder surgery in September.\n\"The reason that we started looking at this is because we've had so many injuries in our rotation, and we're just trying to do the best possible thing that we think for a particular day,\" Melvin said. \"We're just trying to do what's best for us.... We're trying to figure out who goes where to benefit the strengths of our team.\"\nThough all 30 MLB clubs would relish the presence of an ace starter for a do-or-die situation like a Wild Card Game, recent seasons and postseasons have exposed the value of relying on a cadre of relievers over a single 200-inning workhorse. Pitchers tend to fare far better in their first and second times facing an opposing lineup in a single game than they do in their third time through the order, and employing a diverse group of arms across the course of a nine-inning contest allows managers to optimize matchups throughout.\n\"Obviously it's still a new thing to us a little bit, but we've had enough success with it over the last month or so that we're going to give it a whirl,\" Hendriks said. \"The bullpen has been throwing a lot more, and it's just another concept of that. Instead of the starter going six and handing it over to the bullpen or going five and handing it over to the bullpen, now we're just reversing it.\"\n\"In today's game, I think there's been a struggle between old-school mentality and sabermetrics, and this is a way to kind of incorporate sabermetrics with effectiveness,\" said Treinen. \"We have guys in the front office that do a lot of research to put us in the best situations for success, and I think it's our job to put some faith in them. We've got the arms to make this make sense.\"\nUsing a committee of relievers to cover all nine innings -- better known as \"bullpenning\" -- has been an increasingly common strategy across the league over the past few years, especially when clubs find themselves short in the starting rotation due to injuries.

Acid reflux happens when stomach acid flows backward into the esophagus \u2014 the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Glands in your stomach lining make acid and enzymes that help break down food, and it's this mix of remaining food liquid and stomach acid that's backfilling.\n\"Acid reflux typically feels like a burning sensation under your chest, and some people may get a sour taste in their mouth,\" Marvin Singh, MD, an integrative gastroenterologist and voluntary assistant clinical professor at the University of California San Diego's Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, told POPSUGAR. \"Oftentimes, people will have symptoms of reflux after eating particular foods or heavy meals, or when they bend over after eating or lie flat at night.\"\nA dry cough that acts up after eating, particularly if you don't have any other respiratory issues.\nDifficulty swallowing, which may be from an esophagus spasm resulting from reflux but could also point to something more serious. Dr. Singh recommends seeing a doctor immediately if this is an issue for you.\nAsthma flare-ups at night, which could be a result of aspirating small amounts of acid into your lungs.\nMore cavities than normal, thanks to acid-induced erosion of the enamel on your teeth.\nA persistent scratchy throat or hoarseness from acid making its way up past the esophagus to the throat, causing irritation of the vocal cords.\nWhether you have the tell-tale red flags of acid reflux or some of the more head-scratching symptoms above, there are steps you can take to find relief. Before you do anything else, Dr. Singh suggests seeing a physician. Talking to your doctor and running tests will help rule out diseases like Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous change in the lining of the esophagus that can occur as a result of acid reflux) or cardiac chest pain (which can often feel similar to reflux).\nOnce you've ruled those out, look at your lifestyle and particularly your diet. Dr. Singh recommends not overeating, fasting two to three hours before you go to sleep, avoiding trigger foods (alcohol, sugar, caffeine, tomato sauce, citrus, and spicy and fatty foods, to name a few), stocking up on organic fruits and veggies, and maintaining a healthy weight. OTC meds such as Tums are also helpful \u2014 just don't use them as a permanent fix or take them for a long period of time without telling your doctor. \"You could be covering up an important symptom or problem,\" Dr. Singh said."}

The moment is reminiscent of past October Surprise moments, says Robert Parry in this article adapted from America\u2019s Stolen Narrative.\nThe phrase \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d is now part of the American political lexicon, referring to some last-minute event that might change the course of a U.S. presidential election. But the two prototypical \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d cases, in 1968 and 1980, have never earned a place in mainstream American history.\nThe October Surprise allegations of 1968 and 1980 also were something of a misnomer since they centered on Republican efforts to block an October Surprise by sabotaging game-changing diplomatic successes by incumbent Democratic presidents. In 1968, it was Lyndon Johnson achieving a breakthrough in the Vietnam War peace talks. In 1980, it was Jimmy Carter securing the release of 52 American hostages held in Iran.\nPresident Richard Nixon in Robbie Conal\u2019s painting, \u201cWaterbugger,\u201d at robbieconal.com.\nIn both cases, the Democratic presidents failed to accomplish their goals and the Republican candidates, Richard Nixon in 1968 and Ronald Reagan in 1980, went on to victories. Yet, these important October Surprise mysteries have remained largely unsolved: Did Republican sabotage actually play a role in the Democratic failures?\nRecent disclosures from the National Archives as well as statements from participants have shed new light on these dark chapters of U.S. history and revealed previously unknown links between the 1968 case and the Watergate scandal of 1972 and between the 1980 Iran-hostage case and the Iran-Contra Affair of 1985-86. The new evidence suggests a more continuous narrative connecting these scandals and thus represents a powerful challenge to the established history.\nPossibly the most notorious \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d case and the first of this modern era occurred in fall 1968 when Republican Richard Nixon was locked in a tight presidential race with Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and President Johnson was making progress in Vietnam peace negotiations.\nAt that point, a half million American soldiers were in the war zone and more than 30,000 had already died, along with Vietnamese dead estimated at about one million. In late October 1968, Johnson saw a chance for a breakthrough that would involve a bombing halt of North Vietnam and a possible framework for peace.\nHowever, Johnson encountered surprising resistance from U.S. allies in South Vietnam. President Nguyen van Thieu was suddenly laying down obstacles to a possible settlement in the Paris peace talks.\nOn Oct. 29, 1968, Johnson got his first clear indication as to why. According to declassified records at the LBJ Library in Austin, Texas, Eugene Rostow, Johnson\u2019s Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, got a tip from Wall Street financier Alexander Sachs who said that one of Nixon\u2019s closest financial backers was describing Nixon\u2019s plan to \u201cblock\u201d a peace settlement.\nNixon\u2019s backer was sharing this information at a working lunch with his banking colleagues in the context of helping them place their bets on stocks and bonds. In other words, the investment bankers were colluding over how to make money with their inside knowledge of Nixon\u2019"}

Your immediate response is probably the store. Although correct, milk has to start somewhere. Let's take a trip from the milk's beginning - the farm and follow it through to the store. Did you know there are seven major dairy cow breeds? Holsteins are the most popular in the Keystone State. Farmers milk their cows two to three times each day. Unlike many other professionals, they don't get holidays and weekends off. Dairy cows don't care if you want to eat Easter dinner with your family or that you want to watch a Sunday afternoon football game.\nMarch is national nutrition month, which means that you need to be getting the nutrients that your body needs to stay healthy. So remember to get 3-Every-Day to keep your body happy and healthy. Hello this is your Somerset County Dairy Princess, Cheyenne. I am reminding you that either way you get your dairy products, it is important to have them three times a day. Having any type of dairy is an efficient way to get the nutrients that your body needs. Drinking a glass of milk or having a slice of cheese, or even eating a cup of yogurt are delicious ways to receive the nine essential nutrients that your body needs.\nMiguel Saviroff, farm management educator with Penn State Cooperative Extension in Somerset County, offers the following advice concerning beef and dairy products. Mad cow disease is found in the brain and spinal nervous systems of cows and other adult bovine, especially those older than 30 months. Veal are less than 20 weeks of age and most beef is under 19 months, so the market animals should not be affected. Saviroff believes it is highly unlikely that the disease will be found in this area because of the quality controls at the slaughter houses and rendering plants.\nSomerset County Dairy Princess The Webster Dictionary defines the word \"real\" as something that is authentic or genuine. The word real is also how dairy products are defined. Did you ever pick up a package of butter and read the ingredients? There are simply two words: sweet cream and salt. That's it. Both ingredients are found naturally - cream from milk produced by cows and salt in the earth's ground. Now look at a package of margarine. The ingredient list is much longer and many of the words are difficult to pronounce and what are they?\nSomerset County's newest Dairy Princess was chosen June 24 at the Heritage Baptist Church, Friedens. After much deliberation, the panel of judges chose Amy Miller as the 2005-2006 Somerset County Dairy Princess. The contest was extended for a lengthy period of time while the judges tried to make a decision. The contest was so close, that the judges asked each of the three girls to come and talk to them privately, asking them a few more questions. The other two contestants, Alexia Miller and Justine Lehman, will be Alternate Dairy Princesses and will help Princess Amy in the job of dairy promotion.\nMelissa Paul of Berlin has become the new Somerset County Dairy Princess. Miss Paul, 16, is a junior at Berlin-Brothersvalley High School and the daughter of Dave and Patty Paul and Patricia and Jon Marteney.

{"idx": "28180", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Q. Should I use TurboTax or hire a tax professional to do my tax returns?\nA. There is no single answer to this question. Many real estate professionals prepare their taxes themselves, and often with the aid of tax preparation software such as TurboTax. Such software makes preparing your own returns far easier than it used to be, and it can save you money.\nMost tax professionals would likely charge somewhere between $250 and $500 to prepare your return. Tax preparation software typically costs less than $100.\nIf you\u2019ve kept good records and have a relatively simple return, doing it yourself can work just fine. This can work out particularly well if you used a tax pro to prepare your return for a prior year and your return for the current year is much the same.\nHowever, preparing your return will take time \u2014 time that might be better spent selling real estate. Moreover, if your return is complex, you have poor or no records, or this is the first return you file for your business, it may be wise to hire a tax professional.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that tax pros are not all alike. There are three types, and they differ widely in training, experience, and cost.\nAs the name implies, tax preparers prepare tax returns. The largest tax preparation firm is H&R Block, but many mom-and-pop operations open for business in storefront offices during tax time.\nMost tax preparers don\u2019t have the training or experience to handle taxes for businesses and, therefore, are probably not a wise choice.\nA 2006 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office underscores this. Posing as taxpayers, GAO investigators visited 19 outlets of several commercial tax-preparation firms and asked them to prepare returns based on two hypothetical situations.\nThe 19 preparers arrived at the correct refund amount only twice. The GAO said that several of the preparers gave very bad tax advice, particularly when it came to reporting business income.\nEnrolled agents (EAs) are tax advisers and preparers who are licensed by the IRS. They must have at least five years of experience or pass a difficult IRS test. They can represent taxpayers before the IRS and in administrative proceedings, circuit courts, and possibly tax courts, if they pass the appropriate tests.\nEnrolled agents are the least expensive of the true tax pros and are reliable for tax-return preparation and more routine tax matters. They can be quite adequate for most real estate professionals.\nCertified public accountants (CPAs) are licensed and regulated by each state. They undergo lengthy training and must pass a comprehensive exam. CPAs represent the high end of the tax pro spectrum, and are generally the most knowledge and expensive tax pros.\nIn addition to preparing tax returns, they perform sophisticated accounting and tax work. CPAs can be found in large national firms and in small local outfits. The large national firms are used primarily by large businesses.\nSome states also license public accountants. State-licensed public accountants are competent but are generally not as highly regarded as CPAs.\nNational Association of Tax Professionals at (www.natptax.com).\nNote that you don\u2019t have to go to a tax preparer\u2019s office to prepare your return. Tax-return preparation can be handled completely online, by e-mail. There are no laws preventing you from using an accountant online.\nThus, you can use a preparer in another city or even another state. However, it\u2019s wise to stick with a preparer located in your home state because he or she will likely be more knowledgable about your state\u2019s taxes.\nYour relationship"}

Often the pilot does not receive permission to land and has to hover over the airport, and, if necessary, fly to another location.\n\u201cWe are also in constant touch with the pilot through the Flight Following Cell text messages and short emails, passing on real-time information to make decision-making easier,\u201d Herter said.\nHaving a large fleet has its demerits for IndiGo. Delay or diversion of a single aircraft can throw the entire schedule of the day into jeopardy, resulting in more disruptions.\nThe fog that engulfs North India for almost 15 days in December and January has its maximum impact on an airline like IndiGo, which is based out of New Delhi and operates around 900 flights daily.\nAccording to a senior executive of a low-cost carrier, in a market like India, punctuality is something airlines build their brand around. For an average Indian flier, rather than the amenities inside the aircraft, it is the punctuality that matters. He is not ready to pay a lot for comfort but will select an airline which he hears is disciplined.\n\u201cWe have invested in systems to ensure our reliability. All our aircraft are now CAT-III B compliant and also have a technical dispatch reliability ratio of 99, which basically means there is negligible chance of the aircraft being delayed by a technical snag,\u201d an airline official said.\nEvery six months the pilots undergo simulator training for low-visibility flying. \u201cI wish that many more airports in India were CAT-III compliant, though we may have trained pilots and equipped airplanes, we will not be able to operate due to airport constraints,\u201d IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh said.\nTo be sure, the preparations have not been able to insulate IndiGo from the gruelling consequence of fog. \u201cDecember 2 was a bad day, we had a few flights diverted, but rest of the days have been absolutely fine,\u201d Herter said."}

In Europe, where the EU superimposes an often anti-democratic, transnational bureaucracy on top of national electorates, and where anti-Brussels populists have formed majority coalition governments with established center-right parties in several countries, this story has some plausibility.\nBut this isn't the situation in the United States. Despite what the anti-liberal right has told itself for decades and all the way down to the present, its positions are not supported by a majority of the electorate. On the contrary, Republican electoral victories are increasingly dependent on gaming the system, and especially its multitude of counter-majoritarian veto points, to bring about outcomes that would be unachievable using democratic means.\nThe result is the transformation of the Republican Party into a blatantly anti-democratic force.\nAs recently as a decade ago, conservatives had a strong, or at least plausible, case that a majority of Americans \u2014 a silent majority, perhaps, or maybe a distinctly moral majority \u2014 stood with and behind their political aims. Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984 with nearly 59 percent of the vote, after all.\nGeorge W. Bush experienced the first real sign of trouble ahead for the GOP, winning the presidency in 2000 with the help of two counter-majoritarian institutions (the Electoral College and the Supreme Court) while losing the popular vote with just under 48 percent, which was significantly lower than Democrat Bill Clinton managed to poll (49.2 percent) in a three-way race with Bob Dole and Ross Perot just four years earlier.\nBush did win a majority in 2004 (51 percent), and Barack Obama managed to win the presidency and re-election with 53 and 51 percent of the popular vote, respectively. But in 2016, Donald Trump prevailed in his contest against Hillary Clinton despite pulling in a mere 46.1 percent, which was a total of nearly 3 million fewer votes than his opponent. Add in the 2012 vote in the House, when Republicans won a majority of the seats despite winning 1.5 million fewer votes than the Democrats, and the possibility of an even more dramatic electoral discrepancy preventing Democrats from taking control of the chamber in this November's midterm elections, and we're left with a vision of the GOP as a party willing and able to win and hold political power without democratic legitimacy.\nBut the anti-democratic tendency of the Republicans isn't limited to elections. It extends to policymaking. And that is where things become even more ominous.\nIn a recent controversial op-ed, former Trump aide Michael Anton gave us a glimpse of where the anti-democratic tendencies of the Republican Party are headed. Writing against birthright citizenship (the automatic conferral of citizenship on any child born in the United States), Anton declared, on the basis of highly questionable assumptions, as well as shoddy and dishonestly presented evidence, that the passage of the 14th Amendment on which birthright citizenship is based has been fundamentally misinterpreted. (Here is Anton responding to his critics.) On the basis of this (mis)interpretation, President Trump supposedly has it within his power, using an executive order alone, to direct federal agencies to stop conferring citizenship on children born in the country.\nIn this view, the Constitution's guarantee of birth"}

Then we got lazy. During the 19th century, as urban growth accelerated, cities were planned with utilitarian street grids to create easily and quickly developable real estate. The City Beautiful movement of the first half of the 20th century was an attempt to reverse this course and produced many handsome civic monuments in the form of public libraries, museums, state houses, and railroad terminals. The record of postwar city planning is less illustrious, leaving a dispiriting trail of cross-town expressways, public-housing projects, and downtown shopping malls. But things are looking up. The last few decades have seen a revival of urban design that is a combination of lessons learned and innovation, building on the past and planning for the future.\nAs the citizens of London and Paris have known for a long time, nothing is as pleasant in the center of a city as a riverside promenade. Much like parkland, an urban waterway provides a spatial release from the density of the surrounding buildings. The 1.2-mile Esplanade alongside the Hudson River at Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan, N.Y., is a good modern example. The design, by Robert Hanna and Laurie Olin, includes all the necessary ingredients: comfortable benches, wide walkways, and shade trees. Although the river view is the main attraction, the details of lamps, balustrades, and paving enhance the experience.\nPhotograph by Alistair McMillan, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.\nSay \"large urban parks,\" and most of us think of Frederick Law Olmsted's creations in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, Montreal, Buffalo, Louisville, Atlanta, and many smaller cities. That was in the second half of the 19th century, and in subsequent years city parks, with their Victorian bandstands and wrought-iron benches, were considered a quaint throwback to the past. No longer. There has been a renaissance in large urban parks, with new parks built or planned in Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. One of the most unusual examples is Brooklyn Bridge park (right), currently under construction. The park, which stretches over a mile beside the East River, is built on six disused piers that will be transformed into meadowland, picnic areas, and playing fields.\nImage courtesy Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates.\nModern urban parks are more active than their Victorian counterparts, and Brooklyn Bridge Park, designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, will contain jogging trails, bicycle paths, and courts for handball, tennis, and basketball, as well as tidal pools for wading and a still-water basin for kayaking. The juxtaposition of urban density with nature has been a feature of American urban parks since Olmsted and Calvert Vaux laid out Central Park, but Brooklyn Bridge Park's 85 acres will also include nonrecreational uses such as apartment buildings and a hotel, whose development will generate revenue that will be used to maintain the park.

{"idx": "28204", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Cloud's ability to make IT more agile is undeniable, says CIO.com's Bernard Golden. But once that benchmark is met, the cost effectiveness of the internal cloud versus public providers will be a key measure of success.\nThe question of costs associated with cloud computing continue to be controversial. You may recognise in this blog's title, an homage to the motto of Bill Clinton's 1992 Presidential campaign: \"It's the Economy, Stupid.\" The motto referred to the decision by the Clinton campaign to focus relentlessly on how the US economy was doing in 1992, sidestepping other issues and always, always circling back to the economic outlook for the US.\nI was reminded of this by some recent discussions on Twitter that discussed the importance of economics in terms of cloud adoption.\nThis question of cloud economics arises especially in the context of the endless discussions about private vs. public clouds (private usually being thought of as referring to a cloud environment inside a company's own datacentre).\nSome people assert that private clouds obviously must be less expensive, because one owns the equipment and is not paying what is, in effect, a rental fee. The obvious analogy is buying a car vs. renting a car. If one uses a car every day, it's clearly less expensive to own rather than pay a daily rental fee to, say, Hertz.\nSometimes this argument is made stronger by noting that public cloud providers also are profit-seeking enterprises, so an extra tranche of end-user cost is present, representing the profit margin of the public offering.\nThe proponents of public cloud computing cost advantages point to the economies of scale large providers realise.\nAt a recent \"AWS in the Enterprise\" event, Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, noted that Amazon buys \"10s of racks of servers at a time\" and gets big discounts because of this. Also, AWS buys custom-designed equipment that leave out unneeded, power-using features like USB ports. Moreover, the public cloud providers implement operations automation to an extreme degree and thereby drop the labour cost factor in their clouds.\nThere is yet a third approach about cloud economics that calls for blend of private and public (sometimes referred to as hybrid) which marries the putative financial advantages of self-owned private clouds and the resource availability of highly elastic public clouds; this can be summarised as \"own the base and rent the peak.\"\nWhat is interesting about Twitter discussion around this topic is that people point to surveys about private cloud interest indicating the real motive behind the move to cloud computing is agility, i.e., the ability to obtain computing resources very quickly and in an on-demand fashion. Cost savings of cloud computing were considered secondary to rapid resource availability."}

AltaVista also has said it plans to add finance content and news.\nAltaVista powers search queries on Pathfinder as well as and on LawCrawler and IntelliHealth.\nAnalysts have speculated that AltaVista owner Digital Equipment may be building out the search site in anticipation of Digital's impending sale to Compaq Computer.\n\"If you look at the portal marketplace, it makes a lot of sense\" for Digital to be enhancing AltaVista's portal features in advance of closing the deal with Compaq, said Jupiter Communications analyst Patrick Keane. \"Just the Wall Street valuation of the search and portal companies should leave Compaq foaming at the mouth at least a little bit--even if they don't have a particular interest in search.\"\nCompanies in the portal space have seen their stock valuations skyrocket in the past several months, and the various sites have been engaged in a race to match or exceed each other's features and services.\nAltaVista has lagged behind the portal pack for the most part, adding key features such as free Web-based email many months after competitors have done so.\nBut Hirsch noted that both the brand searching capability announced today and the translation services added earlier are unique to AltaVista.\nRealName is not the only brand search available, however.

He makes about $33,000 a year feeding mail into a machine called a delivery bar code sorter.\nThe plant sorts mail for delivery to post offices primarily in the southwest Michigan region, like Grand Rapids, Lansing and Detroit, but like other postal centers around the country, it sends mail all over the United States.\nThe whole country is on alert for anthrax powder attacks sent via mail. But Max says that inside the postal plant there's dust flying through the air all the time. The sorting machines, with their spinning parts, shave off tiny bits of paper from the millions of letters and bills. The ventilation pipes can become so caked with dust that it looks like they're in shadow.\nIt's like being on alert for dust in a dust cloud.\nSince anthrax attacks started sickening postal workers, killing two in Washington, D.C., and encouraging a New York union to sue the Postal Service, the USPS has instituted some new safety measures to help protect employees. Precautions include optional gloves and masks. Also, the sorting machines are now being cleaned of all that dust, with vacuums instead of the traditional blowers that cleaned the machines by spewing the dust into the air.\nMax talked to Salon about how his work environment has changed ... and hasn't.\nWhat's the mood like where you work?\nPeople are a little bit nervous.

But our supervisor actually told us that because of OSHA regulations they were not able to distribute dust masks to us without us being properly trained. For liability reasons -- in case the mask is contaminated and somebody takes it off wrong.\nI was standing right there when he said it, and my jaw dropped. They have to train us how to use paper filter masks! I found that kind of amusing, actually.\nWhat about since the deaths of two postal workers in Washington were reported?

One \u201cvulnerability\u201d the Fed identified was excessive debt by businesses and consumers.\nYet Powell, in his talk in New York, sure didn\u2019t sound alarmed. You would expect a lot of debt this late in an economic expansion, he said, and total debt hasn\u2019t reached the peak levels seen in the late 1980s and late 1990s.

Just a summary of its debt runs to more than three pages of tiny type with a whopping total of more than $183 billion at the bottom.\nApologies if this sounds unsophisticated, but a big debt load is only a problem if the borrower doesn\u2019t have the money coming in to make the payments. In just the last quarter, AT&T had nearly $16 billion of cash earnings.\nIt\u2019s a similar story for some Minnesota companies that seem to have taken on a lot of debt, like Golden Valley-based General Mills.

Nevertheless, this is a serious look at an important issue, and the fact its talking heads could just as easily be working on \u201cOcean\u2019s 14\u201d or \u201cThe Expendables 3\u201d shouldn\u2019t be held against it.\nIndeed, the actors who participate in the first few episodes at least put their money (that is, their time) where their mouths are, traveling to far-flung locales with camera crews in tow to investigate what\u2019s happening and discuss possible solutions. And while they\u2019re not journalists (with the exception of New York Times columnist Tom Friedman), they do exhibit a facility for asking the right questions.\nThe answer\u2019s probably \u201cno,\u201d based on the tenor of the debate, but that doesn\u2019t dissuade the participants in \u201cLiving Dangerously\u201d from dutifully plowing ahead: Harrison Ford exploring deforestation in Indonesia; Cheadle meeting with a scientist who happens to be a devout Christian; Schwarzenegger wondering about a fire season in California and the Western U.S. that \u201cseemed to last all year,\u201d and going to the front lines with a group of firefighters.\nThe statistics used are occasionally mind-boggling (enough forest lost every year to cover Germany), and the stars\u2019 intense reactions at times perhaps a little too studied. Nevertheless, the producers build a compelling case, and keep the production moving by flitting among two or three separate celeb investigators in each hour.\nIn that respect, \u201cYears of Living Dangerously\u201d is banging its head against the climate debate\u2019s version of an invisible ceiling \u2014 composed of greed, religion, partisanship and plain old apathy \u2014 that doesn\u2019t let in ideas with the potential to pollute one\u2019s existing point of view.\n\u201cA thermometer is not Republican,\u201d Cheadle quips at one point, and it should be noted Weintraub, too, is a Republican, so party affiliation isn\u2019t the sole determinant in this conversation.\n\u201cYears of Living Dangerously\u201d has been assembled with all the glitz of a major Hollywood production.

Not so fast - here\u2019s why buying a museum-grade car can be a colossal mistake if you enjoy driving.\nLook, I get it - humans are genetically pre-programmed to enjoy things that are new and immaculate because it\u2019s the easiest way of determining value at a glance. It\u2019s also what separates us from the thumbless animals and their used, rusty appliances. But when this quirky trait is carried over into the realm of automobiles, it can get quite strange indeed. As I\u2019m told humans are also visual animals, I\u2019ve included a listing for an extremely low-mileage example of a 1998 Toyota Supra at a price that approaches monocle-droppingly offensive.\nThis 1998 Toyota Supra Turbo is the last of its kind, meaning it\u2019s the final production year of the model that helped catapult the Fast And Furious franchise to new heights with car bros the world over. Its twin turbocharged 2JZ-GTE engine had the power potential to put a Mclaren 650S to shame in a straight line with a few off-the-shelf modifications and its six-speed transmission was borderline un-freaking-breakable.\nYou\u2019d think that with all this overengineered heft in its powertrain, it would make sense as the perfect daily driver or road trip machine, but this car, almost literally left by the wayside, has less miles on its odometer than most early Chevy Cruze lease returns.\nThe 15,000 mile figure is an interesting one, if only for the fact that when looking at the car\u2019s vehicle history report, you see that from its birth in 1998 to 2002, it was driven 12,000 miles - pretty typical for a car that\u2019s taken out to humblebrag in the church parking lot, but between 2002 and 2015, only 3,000 miles were clocked. This means that it was essentially driven nonce for more than three quarters of its 17-year span, and a car that sits for extended periods of time is never a good thing, no matter what your dad\u2019s insurance agent tells you.\nA few key things can happen when a car is left idle - none of which are good for you, the owner. Glycol-based coolant degrades over time and can damage water pump seals, not to mention corrode the engine\u2019s passages - a big deal considering the 2JZ-GTE has a cast iron block that\u2019s particularly susceptible to rusting from the inside if that isn\u2019t managed properly.\nConventional motor oil, which is most likely what was used on this car, can degrade via its additives separating with fluctuations in weather. The engine also becomes susceptible to water condensation buildup, where the moisture in the air sticks to the cylinder wall liners and all metal parts that aren\u2019t coated in oil. This is a real issue with cars that aren\u2019t driven up to operating temperature - and it\u2019s the same reason that a car that hasn\u2019t been started in a while can exhibit some white fog-like smoke from the tailpipe on startup. It\u2019s condensation being evacuated from the combustion chamber and exhaust, and can only be remedied by running the car up to"}

The records were provided to Bloomberg News by a Republican operative.\nSome of the companies whose planes she used included Coca-Cola Co., Citigroup Inc. and Saban Capital Group Inc.\nThe data was \u201cprovided \u2026 by a Republican operative.\u201d One has to assume that oppo research has been going on against Hillary for the past couple of years, and maybe this nugget has been sitting in a vault since 2008, just in case she beat Barack Obama. What makes this interesting is how early the GOP has begun to work on Hillary Clinton. Her team has just made it clear that they don\u2019t want to jump into the race officially until summer, likely to avoid getting beaten up by this very kind of oppo research. Perhaps this has been timed specifically in response to that delay, and to force Hillary to fight a general election campaign 16 months earlier than the calendar would dictate.\nAlternately, it might be aimed at forcing Hillary into a costly primary. Allen focuses on Romney\u2019s attacks on Hillary, but the data looks more like a Batsignal to progressives in the Democratic Party, and perhaps especially to Elizabeth Warren and her class-warfare schtick. All three of the companies mentioned in the excerpt brings attention to her tight relationship with corporate America, but also to particular points of outrage on the Left. Coca-Cola gets slammed for both its profits and its role in cultural dominance abroad, but it\u2019s the least provocative of the three in this case. Citigroup is one of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks that managed to not just survive the financial-industry crash but come out stronger, thanks to government intervention, while Saban Capital Group is at least in the same general field as Romney\u2019s demonized Bain Capital \u2014 and also controls Univision, the Spanish-language news broadcaster. Haim Saban himself is a big Hillary Clinton backer.\nSenate rules do not proscribe using private jet flights at taxpayer expense, nor doing so with corporate aircraft, as long as the latter is properly reimbursed and does not create any other conflicts of interest. Given that Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure in the Senate was singularly lacking in accomplishment, the chance of a conflict of interest arising is slim, to say the least. This dovetails into another line of attack on her time as Secretary of State, also aired by Romney and Carly Fiorina too, that her record of accomplishment at State consists entirely of earning frequent-flier miles. Even without breaking any rules, the total bill of $225,000 for private jets makes Hillary look as though she considers herself royalty \u2014 and one owed a coronation by the same taxpayers. The benefits of that attack will be shared widely, assuming any Democrats step up to claim their portion."}

The consortium's roots are online. Extreme and co-founder Dan Tanaka of Leominster had an interest in paranormal investigations and met up with like-minded people on the North American Psychic & Paranormal Network website, or NAPPN. Rob Tremblay of Chicopee and Meg Stainer of Leominster are investigators with the group; Worcester resident Taunya Damon, and Leane O'Neil and Adam Hoyt, both from Framingham, are investigators in training. In operation for about a year, the organization is handling several cases, including possible activity in a house in Worcester.\n\u201cThey were very professional and stayed for hours,\u201d said a resident of that house, Michelle Butler of Stafford Street.

He had been cut, stabbed and slashed more than 100 times and left nearly decapitated in the laundry room of the home.\nZachary was 15 at the time. He was arrested and charged with murder as an adult.\nBecause of repeated appeals mostly concerning the admissibility of crime scene evidence, Zachary's trial was delayed until 2003. A jury found him guilty of first-degree murder.\nThe only available sentence at the time of Zachary's conviction was life in prison without parole.\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles was cruel and unusual punishment and therefore unconstitutional.\nSince then, many men sentenced to life without parole across the nation have been re-sentenced to lesser prison terms.\nMore: He killed at 17. Now, he faces life outside prison 42 years after a fatal robbery in York.\nThursday is Zachary's opportunity to plead his case.\nAccording to a petition filed in the York County Judicial Center on Wednesday by defense attorney Samuel Encarnacion, recent consultations with the county district attorney's office revealed that Zachary's original attorney did not advise him that the prosecution had extended a plea offer.\nThe petition did not identify Zachary's \"original counsel.\" Zachary was represented by at least three different attorneys before he went to trial.

According to the New York Times, which threw a saddle on O\u2019Reilly in January and rode him down hard to his demise, Fox paid a small settlement to a junior producer whom he verbally berated at high volume. (She signed a confidentiality agreement and left the channel.) In 2004, an O\u2019Reilly producer sued him and Fox for sexual harassment. He countersued and promised to fight the suit but settled, paying $9 million out of his own pocket. In 2011, he likewise settled with a Fox Business Network host who accused him of sexual harassment. In 2016, Fox News settled sexual harassment claims directed at O'Reilly by two additional former Fox News employees. Later that year, another Fox personality filed sexual harassment charges against the network, naming O\u2019Reilly as one of her harassers.\nThat\u2019s a lot of money, and a lot of allegations. Yet the network waited until the Times assembled the full docket against O'Reilly before it finally took any measures against its popular prime-time host. Surely somebody at Fox, which was O\u2019Reilly's employer for 20 years, bears some culpability for his alleged conduct. The first somebody, of course, would be Roger Ailes, founder of the Murdoch-owned network, and the man who hired O\u2019Reilly. But he\u2019s not around anymore. Ailes was part of the executive suite that approved sexual harassment settlements in cases filed against him and O\u2019Reilly, and last summer the network dumped him against a similar backdrop of harassment charges and settlements.\nIf Ailes and O'Reilly had to walk the plank, why not current Fox co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy? Shine figures in a sexual harassment suit filed against Ailes by current on-air personality Julie Roginsky, who claims the executive did not investigate her harassment complaint and then retaliated against her. Last year, Fox settled a sexual harassment complaint leveled against Abernethy and O\u2019Reilly, Law Newz reported in January. Even if you assume their innocence\u2014and I do\u2014they had to know about the years-long pattern of accusations against O\u2019Reilly and the settlements paid. And given the amount of money paid to protect O\u2019Reilly against the charges, some drawn from the Fox treasury, surely uber-boss Rupert Murdoch knew what was going on. What\u2019s his responsibility for waiting so long to take action? Moreover, what did Rupert\u2019s son James Murdoch know? As Michael Wolff writes today, the network belongs to him now.\nDouble-speaking for itself Wednesday, Fox News parent company 21st Century Fox issued this brief statement: \u201cAfter a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel.\u201d As my Politico colleagues wrote this morning, shouldn\u2019t the thorough and careful review of the allegations have taken place long ago?

If you don\u2019t use one in reply, will you seem stuffy or cold? After the X has featured once in an exchange, does its subsequent absence suggest some kind of snub? And, in the light of current multitude of cases of sexual harassment and abuse in all kinds of industries, should we be extra careful about who we fire off Xs to, for fear of making people feel uncomfortable?\nThe use of Xs in emails at work may have crept in via our increasingly all-consuming online communications (WhatsApp, Facebook et al) with friends and family outside it.

{"idx": "28241", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Is NHS rationing a possibility?\nMoney, money, money - it's a familiar background theme across the NHS in England, but the volume is increasing.\nCampaign funding promises have been made but whoever forms the next government will find some challenging financial issues highlighted in their ministerial red boxes.\nThis week, reports of a tightening of the financial thumb screws have emerged. There is talk of rationing and, as one source told me, \"unpalatable things\" being contemplated by hospital managers and local health commissioners.\nUnder what's been billed as a \"capped expenditure process\", NHS England and the regulator NHS Improvement are telling some trusts to stick within spending limits even if that means tough decisions on the provision of non-urgent care.\nThe new pressure on hospitals and local health commissioning groups in England comes after some trusts overshot agreed spending targets during the last financial year.\nSince the start of this year, from the beginning of April, it has become clear that the biggest over-spenders have been unable to agree their so-called \"control totals\". They have now been told to take firmer action to keep a grip on spending.\nThe Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that NHS officials have contacted health managers in 14 areas of England with a series of proposals for controlling budgets. These include extending waiting times for routine procedures and treatments, downgrading certain services and limiting the number of operations carried out by the private sector for the NHS.\nHSJ first revealed the tougher spending regime in April, quoting from a letter sent to those local health leaders who could not agree their budgets.\nThey were asked to decide \"from which areas further expenditure reductions will be made\", including reviewing the range of medicines prescribed.\nInterestingly, the letter and subsequent dialogue has been with both commissioners, who can limit what they are prepared to pay for, and trusts who might save money by curbing the volume of non-urgent care provided to patients.\nThere was a clue to this tougher approach in the update to the NHS Five Year Forward View plan, published at the end of March. The finger is pointed at those organisations which had historically substantially overspent their \"fair shares of NHS funding\".\nThey are accused of \"living off bail-outs\" taken from other services. They are then told to confront \"difficult choices\" and if necessary \"scale back spending on locally unaffordable services\".\nAn NHS England spokesperson said no final decisions had been made and when final choices were made locally they would need to be approved nationally. But there was no denying the fact that in some areas hospital managers and commissioners were being told to go further than before to keep a lid on spending.\nThe background to this is that NHS England is receiving a much smaller budget increase this year than in 2016/17 which, though originally billed as a generous \"frontloaded\" settlement, appeared to only just cover what the service needed. Patient demand will continue to outstrip the money available with the financial pressure even more intense this year.\nThose who see the NHS as a bottomless pit always requiring more money to be poured in will call for more efficiency savings before another bailout is contemplated. Those who argue that the NHS has been underfunded for some years, with the share of national income devoted to health lagging behind other leading economies, will say the only answer is higher levels of government funding.\nIt's a familiar debate and one which won't go away after polling day.\nThe three main health think tanks, The King'sFund, Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation"}

Rumors swirl that pay equity or her management style are to blame.

I think we were all kind of blindsided,\u201d said a Times insider who attended Sulzberger\u2019s surprise announcement, adding that people inside the paper were asking the same questions as those outside: Why? and Why now?\nIt seems the latter has occurred. Thus a corporate guillotine ended a stellar career at the Times, which Abramson joined in 1997, serving as Washington bureau chief and managing editor after two decades at such publications as Time magazine, The American Lawyer, and The Wall Street Journal.\nApparently Abramson had no reason to believe her job was in jeopardy until this past weekend, when Sulzberger began talking to her about making a change.\nSulzberger--who is chairman of The New York Times Co. and who, with members of his family, controls the public company through a special class of voting shares\u2014claimed Abramson possessed the necessary self-awareness. Whether her leadership style was a factor in her dismissal was unclear Wednesday. But Ken Auletta, The New Yorker\u2019s well-sourced media correspondent, offered an additional reason in a blog on Wednesday: money.\nAccording to Auletta, Abramson recently pressed Sulzberger for a more generous compensation package on discovering that her pay and pension benefits fell far short of those awarded to her male predecessor, Bill Keller. For Sulzberger, whose newspaper has suffered from the same financial stresses as the journalism business as a whole, Abramson\u2019s request was apparently too much to bear.\nWhile one of Auletta\u2019s sources claimed Abramson\u2019s pay was ultimately adjusted to Keller\u2019s level, she also learned, Auletta wrote, quoting one of Abramson\u2019s associates, \u201c\u2018that a former deputy managing editor\u2019\u2014a man\u2014\u2018made more money than she did\u2019 while she was managing editor.

Like the rest of Cupertino's hardware lineup, the mini is sleek, shiny, and stylish. But this miniature, monitor-less desktop has a much higher geek quotient than Apple's more polished consumer offerings like the MacBook, iMac, or iPhone. There's a tinkerer's quality to the Mac mini, a device that's never seemed to have a clearly defined niche.\nThe newest Mac mini may change that perception, at least in the business market. Apple is positioning the consumer model, which starts at $700, as a living room entertainment hub. But the pricier Mac mini with Snow Leopard Server is strictly a business machine. Featuring two 500GB (7200-rpm) hard drives packed into a small aluminum shell, this $1000 device is a workplace server that enables file sharing and backup, syncing and sharing of calendars, instant messaging, and other communications essentials across a small network of Macs, PCs, iPhones, and iPads. The Mac mini's 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 4GB of memory (expandable up to 8GB) have plenty of power for the job.\nOf course, there are less expensive options for small business owners, the more tech-savvy of whom might very well cobble together an office server by installing Ubuntu Linux on an old Pentium desktop that's collecting dust in the closet. But the Mac mini's appeal is ease of use--no surprise for an Apple product--and that's bound to resonate with business people who aren't IT whizzes.\nSnow Leopard's Server Assistant, for instance, is mostly free of tech jargon, although the user would benefit from some Mac experience to understand server-transfer instructions such as: \"You can also transfer information from another volume on this Mac or from a Time Machine backup.\" That may be simple for you to understand, but Apple's target Mac mini with Snow Leopard Server customer may be wonder what a Time Machine is.\nMac mini with Snow Leopard Server owners can add an unlimited number of Mac and PC users without per-user licensing fees. The Mac mini's back side ports include Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 (four ports), HDMI, FireWire 800, and audio in/out. There's also an SD card slot and a Mini DisplayPort.\nThe Mac mini seems well equipped for office life. It may achieve greater success as a small business server than as a living room media center, particularly if the next incarnation of Apple TV is a hit.\nContact Jeff Bertolucci via Twitter http://twitter.com/jbertolucci) or at jbertolucci.blogspot.com."}

Then (if you dare) grab a flashlight and the Mystery Machine and go check them out for yourself.\nSeattle is a city on the rise and under change -- but a new episode of the \"Lore\" podcast shows that we can't escape our past so easily.\n\"Lore,\" a critically-acclaimed podcast about scary stories (ostensibly \"true life\"), has turned its eyes towards Seattle, where plenty of spookiness abounds, it seems. Each episode takes on a theme, a subject, or a place, and dives deep into the, well, lore around it.\nThroughout the 38-minute podcast, host and creator Aaron Mahnke jumps in on a handful of ghost stories from around the area, populated with names Seattleites will surely recognize: Arthur Denny, Doc Maynard, Chief Sealth and more.\nHe also digs in to our history -- literally, starting with how Seattle rebuilt itself after the Great Fire of 1889, even citing the correct start to the fire.\nNoting that while the Seattle underground was quickly condemned by city officials who discouraged people from working or living there, the effect it had on the city and its lore looms large in Mahnke's world.\n\"While no one lives there anymore, it's clearly inhabited by something, something borne of the past -- and reluctant to leave,\" Mahnke narrates. \"Along with views of long-forgotten buildings, many visitors have experienced closer brushes with the past. Some people, you see, claimed to have seen ghosts.\"\nThat wouldn't be the only spot where the city gets spooky or liminal.\nMahnke follows the spirits of Seattle to many areas around the city, including Peter Gessner's creepy castle in Georgetown (where he committed suicide and is still believed to haunt the place) and Pike Place (where Chief Sealth's daughter has long been said to weave her basket).\nOf course that's not the only spot in the city that's rumored to be haunted. Mahnke also touches on the legend of Lou Graham, the city's most notorious madam.\nAnd the gallery above goes through just a handful of sites that are considered haunted by our more local ghost experts, that include a number of spots over former-graveyards the city built over.\nAnd our area's eeriness doesn't stop there; with plenty of serial killers from the area, headlines were made when a construction crew at the childhood home of Ted Bundy claimed they were being haunted (possibly by the killer himself).\nStill, Mahnke spends the bulk of his episode in Pioneer Square, where modern-Seattle was first started by white settlers, and then re-started after the fire. It's here that Mahnke suggests the theme of his episode -- burying history -- can best be codified.\nAllegedly, the area around the pub built by Doc Maynard along Pioneer Square is where many visitors have seen objects move around on their own, or even an elderly man in 19th century clothing standing outside.\n\"His appearance has been so powerful and realistic that most tourists assume he's just an actor helping out with performances. But he often vanishes before anyone can speak with him,\" Mahnke said.\n\"Whether it's the distant sound of an old piano or the echo of spirited laughter"}

Unfortunately, Pilot Down falls short of most of these properties and brings nothing new to the genre.\nYou\u2019d be excused for thinking that a game in which you play a US Airman sneaking his way out of Germany during the Second World War to neutral Switzerland would be a thrilling, exciting, and engaging adventure. After a cut scene composed of comic-book style images showing your B-24 Liberator being shot down during a bombing run over Germany in the winter of 1944, your aim is to survive in unforgiving conditions, evade the Nazis, and get the hell out of there, through stealth. Based around the actions of hundreds of allied airmen shot down during the war, Pilot Down has a pretty imaginative and original plot. It\u2019s a real shame then that the game itself is so basic, repetitive, and unimaginative.\nPilot Down is so riddled with problems, it\u2019s difficult to know where to begin. One of the game\u2019s key faults is the overwhelming stupidity and simplicity of the AI. The aim of the guards is atrocious and they are easily defeated, meaning that many more complex stealth moves are left unused. Also, although being able to detect footsteps, the soldiers seem completely oblivious to gunshots being fired just metres away from them - removing all possibility of ever having a gun battle with more than three soldiers. Similarly, sometimes when you shoot at a guard from a hidden position, they will stand, unflinching, until they have been killed - at which point they fall to the ground in approximately one of three styles - strangely reminiscent of early PS1 first-person shooters.\nAll levels are pretty easy and quite short, and so experienced gamers used to Splinter Cell and other more demanding stealth games will quickly tire of breaking yet another guard\u2019s neck, and then dragging him behind a rock. Apart from completing missions, there is little else to do when playing the game - there is almost no interaction with the environment, and movement is heavily restricted - making the missions themselves even more linear and predictable. The graphics don\u2019t improve the game play much either - most things are dull greys, off-whites and dirty greens and leave you feeling pretty depressed.\nWith Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines, Oxygen had the great idea of creating a historically based survival game, which if done well could have expanded the genre and been innovative. Unfortunately though, through a clearly minute budget and poor execution, Pilot Down has broken no boundaries, and added nothing new or exciting an expanding genre."}

But all national newspapers (bar the Guardian and Independent) backed the idea of self-regulation as an alternative to the system of state regulation floated by those politicians and Hacked Off in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry.\nNow that the Privy Council is shredding those proposals, the question on everyone\u2019s lips is: \u201cWhat regulation will politicians introduce?\u201d Will they, as many expect, push ahead with their own original plans to use a Royal Charter, with a \u201cdab of statute\u201d to set up an independent regulator that will have the power to force press outlets to publish prominent corrections and apologies or face huge fines?\nThese are the wrong questions. We shouldn\u2019t be passively wondering \u201cWhat will politicians do next?\u201d, but angrily asking what earthly right they have to decide on the fate of the press in the first place.\nThe Leveson process was based on a warping of the relationship between politicians and the press that held good since the abolition of state licensing of newspapers more 300 years ago \u2013 a relationship in which the press held politicians to account, not vice versa. Announcing the setting up of Leveson in 2011, David Cameron said it is \u201cvital that a free press can tell truth to power\u201d, but it is \u201cequally vital that those in power can tell truth to the press\u201d.\nThose chilling words informed Leveson, at which various members of the great and good lectured the press about what its \u201cculture and ethics\u201d ought to be. And thus we have arrived in a brave new Britain in which politicians police the press, rather than the other way round. It is this historic shift that allows them now to unilaterally decide how strictly the press should be regulated.\nHugh Grant, so allergic to press freedom that he once publicly fantasised about driving the tabloids \u201cinto the North Sea\u201d, says a Charter-backed regulator would pose no threat to press freedom. Nonsense. Such a regulator would be able to strongarm publications to sign up, through the use of exemplary fines, and would have the power to punish severely any newspaper judged to have done something unethical.\nThat would have a chilling effect on the press, denting editors\u2019 sense of daring, making them wonder constantly if some edgy report might earn them a \u00a31m rap on the knuckles from the overlords of ethical journalism.

In 1946, George Orwell said there were many \u201cenemies of freedom of thought\u201d, but the biggest problem was \u201cthe weakening of the desire for liberty among the intellectuals themselves\u201d.\nToday, our leaders\u2019 encroachments on press freedom are abetted by our own failure to put forward an unapologetic case for the right and necessity for the press to be, in Karl Marx\u2019s words, \u201cthe ubiquitous vigilant eye of a people\u2019s soul\u201d."}

The song was composed by Chen Chien-ci, with lyrics written by Ge Dawei and the music video directed by Shen Xiaowei.\n\"Actually, the song was very difficult to perform. Eason sang the song with so much power that I was afraid he would hurt his back,\" the composer said onstage while promoting the film. But Chan laughed and explained that \"I just used my back muscles to sing my best.\"\nThe singer also said he felt Liu was a very fitting choice to narrate a love story. \"She is a unique woman,\" he said, while Liu said of her philosophy while making the film, \"Time is not used to forget love, but used to witness love.\"\nLiu has had many hits in the past, including the well-known love song \"Afterward,\" which was believed to inspire the new movie and has already ignited people's nostalgia in anticipation of the film project. The pop singer also starred in many films before deciding to unveil her directorial debut this time.\nLiu said it was painfully cold shooting the film in Hailar, one of China's coldest places in the winter of 2017 at minus 40 degrees Celsius. But she said she felt proud and happy to make the film with all her friends in the industry.\n\"Us and Them\" stars Jing Boran, Zhou Dongyu and Tian Zhuangzhuang.

{"idx": "28271", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: 'Suicide Squad': Jared Leto Reveals Final Joker Makeup & Physique?\nGiven all the ways that Suicide Squad will help to establish the shared universe launched with Batman V Superman, it's hard to think of one as surprising or promising as Jared Leto's casting as The Joker. And as Zack Snyder looks to make Ben Affleck's Batman a mainstay in his movie universe, it shouldn't be long before he and Jared Leto go to war on the big screen. But first - the Squad.\nLeto has kept fans in the loop as he slowly transforms into the Clown Prince of Crime, teasing his changing hairstyles and most recently, electric green hair and signature lipstick. It appears Leto just can't keep his vision of Joker to himself, as another photo from the set of Suicide Squad has revealed another image of the villain - seeming to confirm that directors David Ayer and Zack Snyder may both be taking Frank Miller's lead.\nIt's important not to place too much emphasis on Frank Miller's \"The Dark Knight Returns\" comic (as it pertains to more than Joker's appearance), since it is an explicit influence on the formation of a brand new Batman, and not necessarily his arch-nemesis. With the film presumably seeing Leto spend most of his time confined to a cell, it seemed a long shot that any clearer looks at the iconic villain would be given without studio consent.\nUnfortunately, the original photographer has yet to be confirmed, meaning fans should take it with a grain of salt (as usual). Authentic or not, the image falls in line with what we've been expecting to see from this take on the Joker. The rumored scars, bleached skin and history with Batman all fall in line with the \"Dark Knight Returns\" version, and the white suit worn by Leto in the photo cements the link to Frank Miller's original artwork.\nAt this point, it's hard to know just how the image relates to the film at hand. The rumor mill surrounding Leto's Joker has given the impression that he will offer more than a cameo or minor role, but how the Joker swaps his prison uniform for his signature threads and makeup is completely unknown. There's an outside chance the image is simply the result of Leto's own experimentation with the character's look, and may not be the version fans wind up seeing at all.\nBut it isn't just Leto's makeup and fashion sense that offered new insight into his role, but the actor's physique as well. When Leto first admitted that he was gaining \"a lot of weight\" as filming approached, we took it to mean he wasn't intending to get heavier, but perhaps adding on some muscle mass. Considering how physically imposing Ben Affleck's Batman looks to be, few would blame him for at least trying to keep up.\nLeto's weight gain may not be as startling as Henry Cavill or Ben Affleck's, but as we've said before, not every DC Comics icon will resemble a bodybuilder. For instance: the Joker seeming to be anything but the 'gym-going' type means that a leaner, more wiry physique has almost always been adopted by comic book artists.\nIt may be that Ayer and Leto have found a happy medium between big screen hero and comic villain: having Leto bulk up first, before leaning him out. The end result would be a criminal mastermind who conveys years of hard living, scars and injuries"}

Ilhan Omar over her recent remarks around Israel, the new congresswoman basically has three options before her: (1) Fold; (2) Continue the back and forth of the last several weeks or (3) Get more specific and expand the public critique.\nFold: Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Omar herself can go largely silent on Israel. She can perhaps even offer a bigger apology than she did before or she can find some other way to draw closer to the establishment. This is a convenient path.\n* \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. And I want to ask, why is it ok for me to talk about the influence of the NRA, of fossil fuel industries, or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobby.\u201d There are some in the U.S. establishment that have loyalty to Israel rivaling if not exceeding what they have for the United States.\nThe issue with these statement is that in addition to being true, is that they are being read by some to play to ugly anti-Jewish refrains if limited to Jews: They use money to control, they love Israel, not the U.S. The problem with the second readings of them is that they require \u2014 at best \u2014 a remarkably a high level of sensitivity regarding Rep. Omar\u2019s actual words. This may well be the reason the draft text of the resolution effectively targeting Rep. Omar reportedly doesn\u2019t actually mention her \u2014 because they\u2019re not actually referencing her words. As Abba Solomon noted to me: \u201cAIPAC allies should stop hiding behind Jews, and Democratic politicians should stop feigning such sensitivity to Jewish feelings when Zionist lobbying is the subject.\u201d Indeed, some of the readings are akin to being offended by someone saying the word \u201cgypped\u201d \u2014 it really is an offensive word to Roma, but it is widely used with hardly anyone blinking an eye.\nThe sensitivity regarding \u201cdual loyalty\u201d is somewhat ironic considering rather high levels of xenophobia in U.S. discourse, especially regarding things Muslim or now sometimes even Russian. Some of the former has been displayed in how Rep. Omar\u2019s herself has been treated, but it\u2019s far broder. While the draft resolution targeting \u2014 but, again, not actually mentioning her \u2014 reported mentions \u201cconditions\u201d Muslims have faced after 9/11, it confines it to that. It ignores for example, the incredible scapegoating of Muslims that occurred from the highest public officials and biggest media outlets in the U.S. after the Orlando shooting in 2016 that should have caused a tremendous amount of public scrutiny of politicos, the FBI, the media and how they all work together but which has gone largely down the memory hole.\nStill, the current back and forth may be alluring for Rep. Omar. It keeps her the center of much attention, but I fear it will likely presage little positive change in U.S. policy or increase the prospects for a just peace in the Mideast. It feels to me rather like how Yasser Arafat acted on occasion, a sort of longterm game of crit and retreat that might make for a thrilling, star-studded career, but ends up amounting to surprisingly little.\nGet Specific, Expand the Critique: It pays to recall this is hardly the first go around with someone trying to stand up to AIPAC.

Its Springboard technology allows Visor users to add new functions by simply plugging in a module, a feature Palm does not have.\nSome of the prototype Springboard modules announced included a radio, pager, cell phone and MP3 player. In all, 19 developers announced plans to deliver products shortly after the launch. But eight months later only 11 modules are available, the most innovative being the Eyemodule digital camera from Ideo.\nA Handspring executive said the problem isn't with its technology, but rather that companies springing up around the Visor are experiencing growing pains coupled with component shortages.\n\"While I recognise that there is a delay in the modules, the important issue is that each of these companies are facing different challenges and it is not a software issue,\" said Lee Epting, Handspring's director of business development. \"And we've been helping these developers solve their issues.\"\nMany Handspring developers are smaller companies, some of which are struggling to grow a company and develop a complicated product simultaneously.\nAt the Visor announcement, Innogear said it planned to have the MiniJam Digital Audio Player by early this year, but it ran into long lead times on components and growing pains as a small company, an executive said. However, the company has managed to release the Innopak 2V and has added to its product offering plans with the SixPack.\n\"Our desire to build this company right, and the unexpected longer lead times on components, has caused us to miss our original dates,\" said Bob Fullerton, president and chief product officer for Innogear.\nThe ongoing shortage of flash memory has also slowed developers, a problem that Handspring said it is trying to help remedy.\nIn other cases, some of the developers are software companies with no experience with hardware development. That learning curve is slowing the release of products.\nMapping company Marcosoft, maker of the Quo Vadis program, had planned to provide the software for the Navicom GPS module due last November. However, according to Marcosoft spokesperson Tino Frigino, technical difficulties have resulted in the release date being pushed back to the end of this month.\nThe delays don't appear to be hurting Handspring's popularity. According to Gerry Purdy, CEO of Mobile Insights, Handspring has sold all the units it can make. Once the modules become available, demand for the Visor will increase, he said.\nIn addition, users are not expressing much disappointment regarding the dearth of modules.\n\"I haven't received any letters from readers regarding the delay, with the exception of the Handspring modem. I think users still think that the Handspring is a good investment because of the Springboard and the price,\" said Rick Broida, editor in chief of Handheld Computing. \"The delays were not unexpected, because I think that module manufacturers overstated their abilities and weren't taking into consideration development cycles.\"\nPurdy said Handspring's ability to form a company and push a product to market in 12 months may have set unrealistic expectations among developers.\n\"Handspring wanted to demonstrate they could come out with something fast and create a big splash,\" Purdy said.\nIt takes three tries for Microsoft to get something right.

Adopt a vegetarian, or better yet vegan, diet. Some of this stuff has a lot of nuance in it, but this one has far less. It's pretty simple, really.\nThis is one of the charts I found most interesting, and in fact quite empowering. We've all gone on about the food miles of our diets and many of us can probably trot out all sorts of stats on how far the average ingredient has travelled to our plates.

Driving to grocery stores and restaurants produces a much larger quantity of greenhouse gas emissions, and the benefits of avoiding these errands are clear-cut.

Abrams vows to make protecting abortion rights a central part of her campaign.\nAbrams\u2019 top policy priority is an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. She says she will reverse an income tax cut to help fund the expansion.\nAbrams also supports eliminating cash bail for poor defendants, ending capital punishment, and decriminalizing some marijuana offenses. Kemp favors tough-on-crime drug laws and backs a \u201cpublic safety reform\u201d package that includes higher police pay and new anti-gang initiatives.\nVoter ID laws will also be a central issue. As Secretary of State, Kemp has backed strict ID requirements. Abrams made her name in part by opposing such requirements, and the two clashed over the validity of voter registrations Abrams obtained during a drive. Litigation ensued. Both candidates claimed victory.\nOnly one will be able to claim it in November.\nKemp is the one.

Starting in 1992, his parents Darren and Janet Gusdal managed the year-round camp, making sure that thousands of young campers had the time of their lives in their weeks away from home.\nBut in February of 2014, Darren was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Just a week before summer camp was supposed to start, Mitchell lost a father, Janet lost a husband, and Camp Wannakumbac lost a man who had dedicated his life to it.\n\"It's June,\" said Janet, \"Summer camp is in a week, and I'm now widowed and have to run the camp one hundred per cent by myself. It was probably the loneliest time ever.\"\nIn the years before his father's death, Mitchell had left home and embarked on a career as a young graphic designer. He met his partner, Sarah-Anne, and they began to plan a life and a family. The two held their wedding ceremony at Camp Wannakumbac.\nBut the summer of Darren's death changed everything for the Gusdal family.\n\"She has to go on to putting on a strong face, said Sarah-Anne. \"Literally days after her husband dies, she has counselors and kids here. She is running an entire facility by herself.\"\nFor the next three years, Mitchell and Sarah-Anne watched as Janet and kept the camp running. On her own. And they could tell that her still-broken heart wasn't in it. Janet had to leave, and needed a way out.\n\"I agonized for three years, how do I exit this place while keeping it safe?\" said Janet.\n\"We could see that it was really taking a toll on her. She was getting to the point where she started to resent camp and that was something that she sensed in herself, too. She was clearly stressed more than she was happy,\" said Mitchell.\nSo, in the winter of 2018, Mitchell and Sarah-Anne became the new managers of Camp Wannakumbac. At 27 and 28, they're still adjusting to a quiet life away from the city and the professional jobs they had started to establish.\nBut as they follow in his parents' footsteps, Mitchell says he and Sarah-Anne are driven by one thing: a desire to keep Darren's vision of Camp Wannakumbac alive.\n\"We have such an amazing place on the lake here, in this beautiful natural landscape, with amazing community and people. The people and the place are really something special \u2014 and I think he'd be happy to see that we've come to realize that.\"\nFULL EPISODE: What would you fight to hang on to?"}

Almost one million American jobs have been government-certified as lost to NAFTA, with more being outsourced to Mexico every week. Nearly $400 million already has been paid by North American taxpayers to corporations using NAFTA\u2019s outrageous Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) tribunals to attack the policies that protect our health and the environment.\nISDS grants multinational corporations rights to sue governments before a panel of three corporate lawyers that can award the corporations unlimited sums to be paid by taxpayers, including for the loss of expected future profits. NAFTA 2.0 largely eliminates the ISDS threat.\nThe new text also eliminates provisions that forced countries to export natural resources they sought to conserve and restores U.S. rights to prohibit access for Mexican-domiciled trucks that do not meet U.S. environmental and safety standards.\nIt closes loopholes that granted NAFTA benefits to goods with significant value produced in China and other non-NAFTA countries. And, its benefits sets an important precedent by conditioning trade benefits on wage standards. How this Labor Value Content (LVC) requirement that 40 percent of the value of autos must be produced by workers paid $16 per hour or more to qualify for NAFTA will effect production location decisions remains unclear.\nBut, unless the new deal has strong labor and environmental standards that are subject to swift and certain enforcement, firms will continue to outsource U.S. jobs to Mexico to pay workers poverty wages, dump toxins and import their products back here for sale.\nOn this most critical measure, the NAFTA 2.0 text falls short.\nYes, the NAFTA 2.0 text includes terms that could eliminate the fake \u201cprotection\u201d unions endemic in Mexico that lead to workers in new high-tech plants being paid $2 per hour. But absent greatly enhanced enforcement, such terms won\u2019t improve North American workers\u2019 lives.\nPlus, Trump\u2019s text has major new giveaways for Big Pharma that help them keep drug prices high by avoiding generic competition. These terms would lock in current U.S. policies that keep medicines outrageously expensive and export our bad system of protectionist drug company monopolies to Mexico and Canada.\nSo, what happens next? With Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives, only a final NAFTA replacement package that preserves the NAFTA 2.0 text\u2019s progress while addressing its flaws is likely to pass.\nCongressional Democrats are well aware that Trump won in 2016 in no small part by focusing on people\u2019s legitimate grievances with the devastation that U.S. trade policies have caused to communities nationwide. He exploited the infuriating reality that Democratic presidents have pushed NAFTA-style deals and been dismissive about the damage."}

{"idx": "28309", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The Geological Survey of Canada put out a research paper in 2010 that concluded the country has enough geothermal heat to power itself many times over.\nThe big question is how much of that heat can be economically tapped?\nAs a general rule, the hotter and shallower the resource the more economical it is to exploit based on current technologies. The higher the temperature the easier it is to extract the volume of heat required to spin a turbine and generate electricity.\nBut there aren\u2019t many places in Canada, beyond northern B.C., Alberta and the Yukon, that have that right combination of temperature and depth. Everywhere else, you\u2019ll have to drill deep \u2013 as much as 10 kilometres down \u2013 to find enough heat. That\u2019s a deal-breaker with respect to cost and risk.\nIt\u2019s also a nut Ian Marnoch of Port Severn, Ont., is trying to crack. For the past seven years the Ontario inventor has been developing a new kind of \u201cheat engine\u201d that he says can generate electricity more economically from lower-grade heat. And that heat could come from anywhere: the ground, the sun, or an industrial waste process.\nNot that the technology doesn\u2019t already exist to do it. There are other heat-engine technologies out there, most notably those based on the Organic Rankine thermodynamic cycle. These systems transfer heat to a working fluid with a low boiling point, such as ammonia.\nAs the fluid heats up, expands and vaporizes it drives a turbine that generates electricity. The vapour is then cooled, condensing it back into a fluid which is recycled back through the process.\nMarnoch\u2019s heat engine works under a different principle. There is no vaporization of fluids. Instead, the Marnoch system relies on dry pre-pressurized air that expands and contracts as it is heated and cooled, causing pistons to turn that generate electricity.\nThis in itself may not be new, but it\u2019s the way Marnoch has configured his machine that may give it an edge over other technologies. He says his thermal power engine can process heat much faster and at bigger volumes than Organic Rankine machines.\n\u201cIt can process about three times as much heat by value as an Organic Rankine machine of the same size,\u201d says Marnoch, adding that his heat engine can be designed to be much smaller and, therefore, less expensive.\nThat it operates more efficiently also means it can tap into lower temperatures that aren\u2019t viable with other technologies. One area where Marnoch hopes to demonstrate the superiority of his design is in northern communities that currently rely on diesel generators for electricity production.\nAll he needs is the right temperature differential \u2013 that is, the gap between the heat source, such as the water in a deep mine shaft or temperature at the bottom of an old oil or natural gas well, and the heat sink, which would be the cool northern air.\nIf that gap is 20 degrees C or higher there\u2019s potential to generate electricity. The system becomes more economical the wider the gap.\nMarnoch has been working to perfect his patented heat engine with a team of PhD students and professors at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, which has supported development of the machine for the past five years with funding from the federal and Ontario governments. The Ontario Power Authority and Ontario Centres of Excellence were also early funders.\nThe latest prototype of the machine is at the university\u2019s new Clean Energy Research Laboratory, but Marnoch is eager to get the machine out in the field and tested in a real-world situation.\nSt. Marys Cement is one"}

Eir had contested these claims and sued the State in a dispute over the legal basis of the ComReg case.\nSince the case was taken, French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel\u2019s NJJ-led consortium acquired a majority stake in Eir, giving the company an enterprise value of \u20ac3.5bn.

Co-defendant Robert Hecht, a prominent art dealer in his eighties, did not appear in court.\nThe court mainly discussed procedural issues when it resumed after a four-month recess on Wednesday morning, and was expected to adjourn later to a date in December.\nBoth deny wrongdoing in the case, which emerged out of an investigation into the activities of former gallery owner Giacomo Medici, who is currently appealing a 10-year jail sentence and $10-million fine, handed down by a Rome court last year.\nThe trial is being watched closely by the international art world, where many reputable museums like the Getty fear the provenance of their collections will be put under similar intensive scrutiny.\nItaly\u2019s Culture Minister Rocco Buttiglione suggested to journalists last week that the trial would send out a clear signal of Italy\u2019s determination to recover lost art works.\n\u201cWhat belongs to the Italian people must return to the Italian people,\u201d he said.\nProsecutors say traffickers used Medici\u2019s Swiss art warehouses to store artifacts, including priceless examples from the Greek, Etruscan and Roman periods, looted from Italian archaeological sites.

{"idx": "28317", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Earlier today I explained why moral nihilism is self-contradictory in reply to a comment by thedudediogenes on my earlier attack on moral nihilism from last Friday.\nHow I look at morality is influenced most strongly by Nietzsche, Mackie, Leiter, Garner, Greene and Blackford. I think we project our moral sentiments onto the world.\nYes, as a psychological matter of fact, we do sometimes project our moral sentiments onto the world, but this is not mutually exclusive with there being objective relationships of goodness and badness in the world which either justify our particular feelings as correct or are the basis for realizing our feelings are incorrect. Our feelings of preference should be towards those things that conduce to our flourishing and our feelings of aversion should be towards those things that harm our flourishing.\nI view belief in moral facts or truths as similar to theism belief \u2013 as an intellectual comfort blanket.\nThat is a simplistic interpretation of both moral truths and of theism. Neither are purely comforting to those who think they are true.\nMoral facts, say, \u201cSlavery is wrong\u201d play no explanatory role in our understanding of the world.\nMoral facts are not explanations, they are conclusions which determine that an action is the best, the worst, or somewhere in-between. The apprehension of the fact that slavery is wrong plays a deep role in our understanding of the world, which presently prevents millions of people from owning slaves.\nI hardly see how such a blanket statement could be made. Even were the initial reasons slavery was abolished in most parts of the world more cynical and less moral at the time, that is no reason to assume that it does not remain illegal out of moral judgments or (at least) moral abhorrence. And even were it legalized\u2013or even were there ways to get around the law\u2013there are still millions who would abstain from owning slaves on moral grounds, given the current state of values in the much of the world. And if it is true that slavery is wrong (damaging to overall flourishing and maximin flourishing) in the contexts where people think it is wrong, those people may be said to have true, rationally correct moral reasons against it.\nBut even if I am mistaken and there are no moral facts, surely people are motivated to do some things and to refrain from others by what they think are moral facts and because they think those things are moral facts. That is the definitional feature of Mackie\u2019s error theory\u2013there need not actually be any moral facts for us, nonetheless, to think and to be motivated as though there were.\nMoral facts, then, if they exist, are inert in a way that other facts don\u2019t seem to be.\nI do not know exactly what he means by \u201cinert\u201d. If he means they have no ability to move us to action, then he is wrong for the reasons I just noted. Even if they did not exist, Mackie would be right that the misapprehension of them would still be enough to make them effective.\nBut by \u201cinert\u201d we might read thedudediogenes to be referring to another common argument among moral nihilists. He might mean that moral facts cannot be discovered to be facts because, aside from motivating us to action, they do not have causal influence on states of affairs in the world independent of our thought processes about the world. Presumably the only real kind of facts are mind-independent ones and they are proved to be really facts by the ways they observably change the universe by being present.

They would have been out on the streets protesting, perhaps even burning an effigy of the Prophet Mohammed. There would have been posters and emails and a whole lot of ugly words.\nThe execution of migrant worker Rizana Nafeek in Saudi Arabia touched the hearts of people around the world. That a girl of 17, left to care for a baby, in addition to being charged with the supervision of the other children of the household, plus the cooking and cleaning, should be punished \u2013 let alone beheaded \u2013 for what could well have been an accident, was appaling.\nEqually distressing was the careless attitude of the Government. Appeals were made to the king, but it was negotiations with the family on blood money that were needed. Were they even attempted? And how is it that diplomats were so little in touch with her case that a minister claimed in a statement made after her death that she would be released very soon? The extra time that she got as a result of her appeal was due to the efforts of the Asian Human Rights Commission, an NGO based in Singapore, which raised the funds to pay for a lawyer. Would she have been convicted if the embassy had provided her with legal assistance as soon as she was arrested?\nThese questions have to be answered. While the remittances of workers in the Middle East are so important to the Sri Lankan economy, the Government must have the capacity to deal with the problems that they will inevitably encounter.\nHowever, there is an even more important and pressing job to be done at home, in tackling communalism.\nSri Lanka is fortunate that Rizana was a Muslim.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered that Muslim countries consistently back the Government on matters equally close to their hearts, with regard to Tamils.\nThis is part of Sri Lanka\u2019s post-war mess.\nIn the last year or so, these people have been increasingly active. We have seen the emergence of several very unpleasant websites, in Sinhala and English, dedicated to vilifying Muslims. And they are constantly on the look-out for new ways to draw the majority into their communalism. Recently, they have been talking about the \u2018tax\u2019 Sinhalese have to pay towards the construction of mosques as a result of the money some businesses spend on halal certificates, with absolutely no concern for the fact that the funds are likely used only to administer the system and that this is anyway an incidental cost for manufacturers, and one that they only bother to pay if they feel that they can sell enough of their products to the mere 9% of the Sri Lankan population that are Muslims. In other words, it is a non-issue.\nBut extremists are never ones to let facts get in the way of their preconceived notions. They are now urging Sinhalese to boycott shops and companies owned by Muslims, in an attempt to establish some kind of commercial apartheid.\nMore seriously, there have also been attacks on Muslim shrines and mosques, notably in Anuradhapura in June 2011 and in Dambulla in April 2012.\nThere was a time not long ago when the JHU was the vanguard of Sinhalese extremism.

After the merger, the towers of Reliance's Reliance Infratel unit will be merged with those of GTL, though Reliance will continue to own its fibre optic network.\nThe merged entity will have over 80,000 towers, with Reliance Communications as a key tenant, the company said. The transaction is expected to be closed in the next six months, it said.\nFor Reliance, the plan to sell off its tower business is one of several plans being considered by the company to decrease its debt, and fund its expansion in a market where competition has driven down rates for voice calls at times to below Indian rupees 0.01 (US$0.0002) per second. Previously, calls were charged by the minute.\nReliance said earlier this month that its board of directors has approved in principle a plan to sell off up to 26 percent of the company's equity to strategic or private equity investors.\nThe bids in a recent auction for 3G spectrum went way beyond expectations, and after winning bids in 13 service areas, Reliance is planning to raise funds to retire some of its debt and fund the rollout of 3G services, said Kamlesh Bhatia, a principal research analyst at Gartner.\nReliance paid the Indian government 86 billion rupees (US$1.86 billion) last month in one-time fees for 3G spectrum. The Indian government has said that spectrum will be available to successful bidders by Sept 1.\nOwning and setting up towers made business sense for operators at a time when a critical differentiator was increasing the area under mobile coverage, Bhatia said. That strategy led to the creation of vertically integrated mobile service providers like Reliance.\nHowever, demand for shared networks is now likely to go up as operators plan to roll out their 3G networks, according to analysts. After paying large charges for 3G spectrum, operators may look to cut costs through shared infrastructure, he added.\nBesides Reliance, a number of other operators have either sold off their passive infrastructure or merged them into mobile infrastructure services companies.\nEarlier this year, mobile operator Aircel sold off its towers to GTL. Bharti Group, Vodafone, and Aditya Birla Telecom set up a mobile infrastructure services joint venture in 2007.\nOwning towers and other passive infrastructure does not help mobile operators to differentiate any more, Bhatia said. By staying out, or getting out of the tower business, mobile operators want to free up capital to focus on their expansion, and add new differentiated services around 3G, he added."}

The study of RNAi\u2014a natural mechanism for blocking, or silencing, genes\u2014is a relatively young field in scientific terms. But the process is so simple and powerful that its discovery led quickly to a spate of commercial activity. Investors hope that RNAi will offer a quick route to new types of RNA-based treatments. RNAi has also become a leading research tool for drug discovery.\nTo get a bird\u2019s eye view of what might be ahead in this dynamic field, I recently spoke to John Maraganore, CEO of Cambridge, MA-based-Alnylam (NASDAQ: ALNY), arguably the dominant commercial force in RNAi at this time. Maraganore was formerly an executive at two other major local companies\u2014Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing year for RNAi,\u201d Maraganore says. \u201cThere are six RNAi therapeutics already in clinical trials, and given how young the field is, that is remarkable.\u201d What\u2019s most encouraging is that those candidate drugs are spread out over several companies, and one of these products (from Philadelphia-based Opko) is already in Phase 3 human trials.\nAnd Maraganore thinks there will be more companies forming around both RNAi and the related emerging field of microRNA, which exploits other types of RNA molecules that the body uses for gene silencing.\n\u201cVenture investment has increased, and we\u2019ll see more startups in both RNAi and microRNA,\u201d Maraganore says. That prediction is a bit ironic, since he also says Alnylam \u201ctries to enter [a field] with a lot of intellectual property built up, which has made it difficult for competitive efforts.\u201d Some experts, such as Dicerna co-founder John Rossi, charge that Alnylam\u2019s fortress of patents stymies commercial growth of the field.\nBut even Alnylam didn\u2019t start out with all the patents it needed. It made key in-licensing deals with California-based Isis Pharmaceuticals, a pioneer in antisense\u2014another RNA-based method of gene silencing that\u2019s been around for much longer than RNAi.

In an announcement today, Alnylam said it ended 2007 with more than $450 million on hand (exceeding the expected $435 million) and expects to end this year with some $390 million. The company also indicated it intends to form at least two more major alliances this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a significant number of new alliances in 2007; I expect 2008 to be equally strong,\u201d Maraganore says."}

{"idx": "28331", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When Chicago writer Sarahlynn Pablo heard about the Standing Rock demonstrations in North Dakota last year, she wanted to get involved somehow. But the epicenter of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) felt very far away. That was until she realized that the controversial crude oil pipeline \u2014 restarted last month after a White House directive \u2014 ends right here in her home state.\nSo, she wrote to Curious City: What is Illinois&apos; involvement in the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline? Which state agencies, legislators and companies are involved?\nWell, the \u201cwhat is\u201d wording is a bit out of date; DAPL\u2019s presence in Illinois was settled more than a year ago, and construction was largely wrapped up last November. The process of how that happened is wonky, but Sarahlynn\u2019s question remains important, and not just because the oil industry is a major economic player in the United States. Pipelines such as DAPL have been controversial in the last few years. High profile oil spills show how pipelines can pose risks to waterways. Activists across the country have argued that new pipelines will lead to the burning of more fossil fuels and expedite climate change.\nLittle wonder, then, that Sarahlynn wanted to know more about who makes decisions about pipelines in the state, and how Illinois citizens fit into a process that has consequences at both the local and national levels.\nSpoiler alert: It\u2019s currently very difficult for average citizens to participate in Illinois pipeline hearings. But as we looked at how DAPL played out here, we found people who feel there&apos;s potential that the process might open up in the long run.\nBefore we get to who oversaw approval of DAPL\u2019s presence in Illinois, let\u2019s start with why it passes through the state in the first place.\nIt may come as a surprise to many, but Illinois is the No. 1 oil refiner in the Midwest. (It\u2019s No. 4 in the nation if you\u2019re wondering!) With four refineries inside its borders and several more in neighboring states, Illinois plays a big role in refining, storing and transporting U.S. oil. Some of that oil is transported by train or truck, but much of it flows through more than 7,700 miles of oil pipelines that snake through the state.\nMany of those pipelines \u2014 including DAPL \u2014 run through the southern Illinois town of Patoka. The area hosts tank farms that store millions of barrels of oil, two refineries, and pipelines that fan out like spokes on a wheel. Some of the Bakken Formation oil that will come to Illinois via DAPL will be stored and off-loaded to refineries in the Midwest, but a large portion of it will hook up to another pipeline and eventually end up at refineries and outlets along the Gulf of Mexico.\nThat\u2019s one of the big reasons Illinois was so important to this project: Patoka offers a convenient connection to its parent company\u2019s existing pipeline to Texas.\nWho in Illinois approves pipelines like DAPL?\nFour major Illinois agencies had to give the green light to the DAPL. Each one oversees a different aspect.\nThe Illinois Department of Natural Resources looked at risks to wildlife, specifically those posed to endangered chorus frogs and fritillary butterflies. The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency made sure no major historical sites would be disturbed. And the regional office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assessed risks to federally protected waterways such as the Mississippi River and the Carlyle Reservoir.\nBut the biggest regulatory"}

Gone are the days you had to arrive at the airport hours in advance to check-in, because today many airlines allow you to do it directly from your phone or computer. By entering your name and confirmation number, you can check-in as early as 24 hours before your flight.\nGetting through airport security is a hassle every passenger has to endure, but standing in line at the check-in counter isn't. When you check-in early online, you can proceed straight to baggage drop-off or to the security gate if you have no bags to check. During peak airport times and travel days, early check-in can be the difference between arriving at your gate on time and missing your flight.\nSome airlines, such as Southwest Airlines, reward customers who check in early by giving them first choice of seating on the plane. Rather than assigning passengers seats when they purchase their tickets, passengers are assigned boarding groups on a first come, first served basis. In such cases, the first set of passengers to check in are the first to board the plane and choose any seats they desire, while those who hold off until the last minute are left with whatever seats remain unfilled.\nTo cut back on fuel and overhead costs, some airlines may overbook their flights and sell tickets to more passengers than there are available seats. The airline stands to gain money if multiple people cancel or fail to show up for their flights -- but problems arise when everyone who bought a ticket arrives at the gate. Airlines will typically ask passengers to voluntarily give up their seats in exchange for some form of compensation, but if no one is willing to comply, the airline may bump the last people to check-in from the flight. Early check-in ensures you'll get a spot -- unless you're willing to hand over your seat, that is.\nSome airlines go the extra mile for frequent flyers who choose to utilize online check-in services by offering occasional promotions that reward bonus miles for doing so. Bonus miles will help you score discounted -- or even free -- flights when you travel in the future. Of course, to qualify for this advantage you must be enrolled in a frequent flyer program through the airline offering the early check-in and bonus miles opportunities."}

{"idx": "28343", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As an avid observer of national politics I\u2019ll be honest and admit that President Obama\u2019s last debate performance was nothing short of abysmal. What I find particularly frustrating about Barack Obama in general, and in his performance in the last debate in particular, is that he continues to fail to counterpunch with some very basic facts when challenged by his opponents on the right. Here are just a few suggestions that should be taken to heart, if the president wants to win the last two debates.\n1) Nature and Size of Deficit Spending: Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the rest of the conservative community need to be called to account for misrepresenting the reason why the deficit is where it is at the present time. Obama\u2019s critics on the right have never been honest when it comes to analyzing the current economic downturn. Rather than addressing the Great Recession for what it is, the worst downturn since the Great Depression, they\u2019ve routinely portrayed it as a garden variety downturn made all the worse by Obama\u2019s policies trying to link those \u201cfailed\u201d policies with the growth in the national debt. Obama\u2019s counterpunch here is obvious, during the next debate, and thereafter, he needs to ask Mitt Romney why he doesn\u2019t understand that when the economy falls into a deep recession, government spending goes up as a result of increased outlays for unemployment, food stamps ad infinitum, while tax revenues decline and that those factors have played a large part in the growth of the deficit. Moreover, he could ask Romney what he and the Republican\u2019s would have done differently and to what effect. That\u2019s pretty easy to understand and rather straightforward yet Obama and his surrogates have failed to throw these very obvious and elemental counterpunches much to their own detriment. The second counterargument that Obama needs to make is that this administration, unlike the last, put the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on the books so that those costs were reflected in deficit spending more accurately than had previously been the case. That in and of itself would have resulted in a dramatic increase in the deficit regardless of the state of the economy.\n2) Medicare: President Obama needs to make it crystal clear that there is a fundamental difference between reduced outlays for Medicare that result from reduced payments to insurance companies and health care providers compared to reduced funding levels for the Medicare program per se that would result from conservative proposals. After establishing this factual difference Obama needs to press Romney on whether or not he understands this fundamental difference and to prove that it isn\u2019t true.\n3) Attacking Success: Obama needs to challenge the notion that he\u2019s an enemy of success and that should start with the statement, based on his own life, that he himself is the embodiment of American success. Secondly, he needs to point out that asking the very wealthy to pay a little bit more in taxes isn\u2019t the same thing as attacking success. Obama isn\u2019t attacking the American system of private property and private initiative, he\u2019s merely asking for a readjustment of tax rates that are now skewed to the benefit of a few in what many economists have called the greatest upward realignment of wealth since the 1920s. President Obama should ask Mitt Romney to cite a specific example where Obama conceptually, theoretically or figuratively has come out and denounced the American value of success.\n4) Role of Government: President Obama needs to publicly disabuse Mitt Romney of the notion that almost everything that has ever benefited America is a function of private enterprise. Obama needs to give Mitt Romney a history lesson in the role of the federal government in fostering growth in the American economy that began"}

Any day now, surely, the wildlife corpses would start showing up \u2014 especially birds, for who likelier to pay when a sky turns rogue than the ones who act as if they own it?\nYet biologists studying the hurricane\u2019s aftermath say there is remarkably little evidence that birds, or any other countable, charismatic fauna for that matter, have suffered the sort of mass casualties seen in environmental disasters like the BP oil spill of 2010, when thousands of oil-slicked seabirds washed ashore, unable to fly, feed or stay warm.\nTo the contrary, scientists said, powerful new satellite tracking studies of birds on the wing \u2014 including one that coincided with the height of Hurricane Sandy\u2019s fury \u2014 reveal birds as the supreme masters of extreme weather management, able to skirt deftly around gale-force winds, correct course after being blown horribly astray, or even use a hurricane as a kind of slingshot to propel themselves forward at hyperspeed.\nHumans may complain about climate change. Birds do something about it. \u201cMigration, in its most basic sense, is a response to a changing climate,\u201d Dr. Farnsworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s finding some way to deal with a changing regime of temperature and food availability.\u201d For birds, cyclones, squalls and other meteorological wild cards have always been a part of the itinerant\u2019s package, and they have evolved stable strategies for dealing with instability.\nAmong a bird\u2019s weather management skills is the power to detect the air pressure changes that signal a coming storm, and with enough advance notice to prepare for adversity. Scientists are not certain how this avian barometer works, yet the evidence of its existence is clear.\nSongbirds and their so-called passerine kin may be notorious lightweights \u2014 if a sparrow were a letter, it could travel on a single stamp \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re as helpless as loose feathers in the wind. Passerine means perching, and the members of this broad taxonomic fraternity all take their perching seriously.\nWhen a storm hits, a passerine bird can alight on the nearest available branch or wire with talons that will reflexively close upon contact and remain closed by default, without added expenditure of energy, until the bird chooses to open them again. If you\u2019ve ever watched a perched bird in a high wind and worried, \u201cPoor squinting thing \u2014 could it be blown away and smashed to bits down the road?,\u201d the answer is not unless the perch is blown away with it.\nScientists have found that many migratory birds, especially the passerines, seek to hug the coast and its potential perches as long as possible, leaving the jump over open water to the last possible moment. But for birds over the open ocean, hurricanes pose a real challenge, and they can be blown off course by hundreds of miles. In fact, ornithologists and serious bird-watchers admit they look forward to big storms that might blow their way exotic species they\u2019d otherwise never see in their lifetime.\nHurricane Sandy did not disappoint them.

{"idx": "28363", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For arguably the first time, Republicans are starting to draw red lines in an effort to save President Trump from himself.\nAs Trump weighs firing one or both of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and special counsel Robert Mueller, a pair of GOP senators is promising measures to thwart or dissuade him. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said Wednesday that his panel would not confirm a new attorney general to replace Sessions this year. Then Thursday morning, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said he would introduce legislation to protect Mueller and warned it \u201ccould be the beginning of the end\u201d of Trump's presidency if he tried to fire the special counsel.\nBoth moves are unprecedented. For perhaps the first time, Senate Republicans with real sway are talking about concrete steps to counteract Trump's impulses and prevent constitutional crises.\nLike Graham, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been among the most vocal Trump critics in the GOP, including giving a brutal speech denouncing Trump's worldview in February in Munich. But even that speech didn't call out Trump by name, and McCain has frustrated Trump's opponents by not backing up his words with actions, such as voting against Trump's agenda.\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), too, has been called upon to occasionally denounce Trump. And sometimes he has obliged. But he has also assumed a nonconfrontational approach to dealing with the president, repeatedly brushing off his tweets \u2014 including as recently as Thursday morning \u2014 in favor of trying to work with Trump to get things done.\nThere have been some threats of legislation or actions by Republicans to stop Trump. In January, for instance, GOP senators led by McCain threatened a bill to prevent Trump from lifting sanctions against Russia. Similarly, Graham in March suggested he might call for a special committee to look into Trump's baseless allegation that President Barack Obama wiretapped him.\nBut this is the first time the stakes have been this high. And Grassley and Graham are going on-record with specific actions and threats.\nLook, politics is an inherently disingenuous business. Sometimes you say something with a little extra conviction to send a message, or you make threats that you're not 100 percent committed to backing up. Politicians also have to deal with the realities of alienating a president who has significant sway over whether they can pass their agenda. There is no doubt Republicans, after denouncing Trump repeatedly on the campaign trail and seeing him win anyway, have grown gun-shy. This is the moment he's gone too far and I can cut him off, they've thought so many times, only to be proven wrong in short order.\nI'm not one of those people who thinks McCain can't denounce Trump one day and vote for his agenda the next. McCain is a conservative Republican, so he tends to support Republican legislation. He wants to replace Obamacare, so he voted to move forward with a debate on doing just that this week, despite his reservations about the process.\nBut at some point, Republicans who think Trump is truly flirting with a constitutional crisis will need to back up their tough rhetoric with actions. Grassley and Graham seem to be at least edging toward doing that \u2014 perhaps recognizing the uniquely fraught options Trump is apparently considering.\nWe'll see how much follow-through there is. But at some point, the rubber must meet the road, or it just amounts to a bunch of talk.\nUpdate: Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.)"}

Bad news: it probably makes no difference whatsoever.\nThis might be something you knew already, but research by privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo -- which famously does respect DNT requests -- found than more than three-quarters of people were not aware of that that many sites ignore DNT settings.\nDuckDuckGo points out that sites are not technically doing anything wrong in choosing not to take any notice of DNT requests. That's because the \"Do Not Track setting is only a voluntary signal sent to websites, which websites don't have to respect\".\nIt can be alarming to realize that Do Not Track is about as foolproof as putting a sign on your front lawn that says \"Please, don't look into my house\" while all of your blinds remain open.

Most notably, Yabloko party founder Grigory Yavlinsky lost his chance to run for election after the Central Election Commission (TsIK) refused to register his candidacy, saying a significant portion of the 2 million signatures of support he had gathered as part of his application were flawed.\n\"Who's making this decision?\" Yavlinsky said at a news conference in Moscow. \"I think Vladimir Putin's making this decision. Who else? No one else.\"\nIt soon became clear that the signatures in question were in fact far fewer in number -- less than 3 percent of the overall total -- rather than the more than 5 percent the TsIK had claimed.\nThe call to register Yavlinsky became one of the biggest rallying cries at the February 4 opposition protests at Bolotnaya Square, and even EU foreign-policy chief Catherine Ashton weighed in, urging the authorities to reconsider their decision.\nAn activist shows a sticker with an image of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that says: \"Thief in the Kremlin? Or in prison? March 4, you decide.\"\nNonetheless, the Russian Supreme Court ultimately ruled the TsIK decision was legal. Yavlinsky remains off the ballot.\nSo too does a second opposition figure, Eduard Limonov. Limonov, the head of the Other Russia coalition, saw his candidacy hopes vanish when his supporters were barred from a hotel they had rented for a nomination meeting. The group later managed to hold a meeting on a bus, but a notary public refused to validate the proceedings.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the TsIK's decision, and Limonov appealed the refusal of registration in the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe dwindling pool of alternative candidates added fuel to the season's wave of mass opposition protests, which were some of the largest in the country's post-Soviet history.\nBut here as well, pro-Putin forces sought to counter the unprecedented wave of public activism, organizing rallies so well attended -- some by more than 100,000 people -- they prompted accusations that the authorities were using administrative resources to build sizable, if less than enthusiastic, crowds.\nPutin himself acknowledged that budgetary resources had contributed to the rallies, but remained sanguine about their effect. \"Of course, when the authorities organize something, there's always talk about administrative resources,\" the prime minister told the Interfax news agency. \""}

This triumph of genetic engineering, achieved last week by Scottish embryologist Ian Wilmut, might well mark the defeat of the idea that genes determine who and what we are.\nA clone is an identical twin, a second creature with a genetic code identical to the first\u2019s. Dolly, in other words, is the twin sister her original never had. Identical twins are rare in nature, and because they\u2019re created when a single fertilized egg divides into two embryos, they\u2019re born at the same time. If Wilmut\u2019s techniques for cloning mammals prove to be practical, that time constraint will no longer exist. It will be possible to make twins whenever we want, to replace your old dog Pete with Puppy Pete, to replicate a deceased human infant, or to copy yourself.\nBut twins usually grow up in the same family and community (studies of their rearing suggest that people treat identical twins much more alike than they treat siblings or even fraternal twins). A clone\u2019s environment will be different. It will grow from a different egg, develop in a different womb, possibly grow up in a different place, and have different triumphs and disasters.\nCloning, in other words, offers the possibility of the mother of all \u201ctwin studies\u201d\u2013comparisons of how often a trait appears among identical twins vs. how often it appears among others. Twin studies these days are invoked to feed the popular notion that genes determine behavior, since they suggest that genes play a role in such things as schizophrenia, alcoholism, performance on intelligence tests\u2013even proneness to divorce (a 1992 study of 1,500 sets of twins found that if one twin had been divorced, the likelihood that the co-twin had also been divorced was 45 percent in identical twins, but only 30 percent in fraternal twins).\nSince Galton\u2019s time, the Nature-Nurture dichotomy has hardened into competing ideologies. A vigorous intellectual movement in favor of Nature in the 1920s gave rise to a countertradition emphasizing the importance of Nurture, which spawned the field of cultural anthropology. Meanwhile, the school of Nature, following the discovery of DNA in 1953, evolved into sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, whose adherents believe that the common heritage of human nature, transmitted through genes, has a greater effect on behavior than culture and history do.\nThe political and cultural arguments, however, lag behind the lab work. At conferences and seminars, biologists and psychologists have been overheard remarking to one another that the Nature-Nurture dichotomy can\u2019t accommodate what they\u2019re finding.\nConsider, for example, oxytocin, a hormone found in the bodies of many mammals, including human beings, where it is associated with uterine contractions and breast-feeding. Add a little oxytocin to female rats\u2019 brains, and they get friendlier. Block receptors for oxytocin, and the creatures threaten each other more. Oxytocin also seems to raise tolerance for pain, and it decreases blood pressure. Sounds like the rule of Nature.\nThe question of where characteristics come from also turns out to be too complicated to divide neatly into Nature or Nurture, according to Stephen Suomi, director of the Laboratory of Comparative Ethology at the National Institutes of Health."}

The players on the team were a major part.\n\"Once I got down there and got with the guys,\" Joyce said, \"I felt a lot better at Southern than I did at any other place.\"\nBy the time the summer months dwindle down, Joyce will be heading south to play shortstop for the SCSU Owls, a Division II school out of the Northeast-10 Conference. The Owls are one of two \"Southerns\" in the league, the other being Southern New Hampshire University, where Joyce's father, Bruce, coached for 21 seasons.\nThe baseball diamond was Ethan's version of a Jungle Gym growing up. He was always around his father, and in turn, was always around college baseball players, absorbing the game like a sponge.\n\"It's been pretty cool to see him kind of grow up around the game and mature around the game,\" said Bruce Joyce, who currently assists for the Exeter High School baseball team. \"To put the two things together has been pretty special along the way.\"\nEthan is a senior and the only fourth-year starter for Exeter baseball coach Kevin McQueen. He's the defensive glue of the infield at short, the leadoff hitter at the plate and a strong, starting right-hander in the pitching rotation.\n\"You get to know him,\" said McQueen, who also has Joyce in his morning math class at the school. \"You know how much he loves the game and he works at it. Some people will look at someone who has the skill-set that he has and say 'It just happens,' but he puts the time in as well. He's a baseball player all the way through.\"\nJoyce works on his game three or four times a week with his father. He attended a Top 96 Showcase for college coaches and traveled throughout the Northeast with the Seacoast Mavericks AAU team, which used him as both a shortstop and a closer.\nIt was a different Northeast-10 school, Merrimack College, that was the first to pop on Joyce's radar. Later, more localized schools like Franklin Pierce University, St. Joseph's College (of Maine) and Keene State University entered the mix.\nThe connection with SCSU developed in the latter innings, picking up steam last summer at the N.H. Junior Games at Saint Anselm College. That was the first time the Owls' coaches saw Ethan live, and not long after, they began recruiting him as a shortstop, which has always been his true love.\n\"Obviously, people like to see strikeouts and pop-ups and stuff like that,\" Ethan said. \"I get more into the game as a shortstop than I am as a pitcher, because there's only so much you can do. Pitching is just throw a ball and see if they hit it, but if you're at short and the ball comes to you and you get that one opportunity to make the play, you better make it.\"\nThe infield was a need for the Owls in this recruiting class, meaning Joyce should compete for playing time as a freshman.

A doubling also occurred among U.S. middle school students saying they've experimented with e-cigarettes \u2014 from 1.4% to 2.7% \u2014 and similar spikes in teen usage were found in the 2013 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\"The increased use of e-cigarettes by teens is deeply troubling,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden said in announcing the findings. \"Many teens who start with e-cigarettes may be condemned to struggling with a lifelong addiction to nicotine and conventional cigarettes.\"\nThe CDC survey comes as the federal government is expected to announce, as early as October, its plan to regulate these battery-powered devices as tobacco products. E-cigarettes heat a solution containing nicotine, which is derived from tobacco leaves, into a vapor that users inhale. While they don't have the myriad chemicals of regular cigarettes, they still provide a nicotine kick.\n\"We don't yet understand the long-term effects of these novel tobacco products,\" Mitch Zeller, director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. He said the survey's findings reinforce why FDA plans to regulate the booming market of e-cigarettes, which each of the nation's top three tobacco companies have joined in the last 16 months.\nThe annual survey found that while most teens who say they've used e-cigarettes also report using regular cigarettes, one in five middle school students who've tried the former say they've never tried the latter.\n\"This indicates that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to nicotine addiction and use of other tobacco products,\" says Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. He blames this upswing on slick new marketing, which enlists celebrities including Jenny McCarthy, Stephen Dorff and Courtney Love for the pitches.\n\"These ads portray e-cigarette use as an act of rebellion, much like cigarette ads have done,\" Myers says, adding they undercut efforts to de-glamorize smoking to kids. He also says the sweet flavors of some e-cigarettes, such as chocolate and \"cherry crush,\" lure youth.\nThe survey finds more teens aren't just trying e-cigarettes once. Last year, 2.8% of high school students said they used them within the past 30 days, up from 1.5% in 2011. For middle school students, such usage rose from 0.6% to 1.1% during the same period.\nThe Florida survey, done by the state's health department, provides similar but more recent data. This year, it found that 5.4% of the state's high school students say they used e-cigarettes within the past month, up from 3.1% in 2011.

They began their push in the Southern States of Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas which is how they caught the attention of John Grisham.\nGrisham appeared on LINK public television, along with members of Public Citizen and explained that it is happening all over the United States. The Chamber of Commerce funds these power grabs, attacking judges who make decisions in favor of ordinary people and replaces them on the bench with corporate friendly judges.\nHere is how they did it to Judge Oliver Diaz of Oklahoma.\nThe Chamber spent $19 million dollars distorting his reputation, using decisions he made for a defendant, and dishonestly twisting the results in the newspaper. When Diaz tried to buy ad time on television in his area, the Chamber used all the ad time and squeezed him out.\nHe borrowed money from an attorney friend, Paul Minier, to defend himself with ads in the newspapers. The Chamber of Horrors immediately filed suit against him claiming that he made decisions in favor of this attorney. He was suspended from the bench. But, he had recused himself every time his friend came before his court. The case got thrown out after the opposition pulled delay after delay after delay. Then they filed suit against him for tax evasion while he was still in suspension. Again, delay, after delay and the phony suit was thrown out, costing the judge a million in defense, and three years off the bench.\nWhen he finally got back on the bench, he lost re-election to Keith Starret because people believe, where there is smoke there is fire. There MUST have been something shady going on.\nThere was. The Chamber of Horrors.\nIf a defendant has his leg cut off by a piece of farm machinery that was defective and goes for a jury trial and wins in court. The court has the power to reverse the decision, lower the amount, or throw it out and the defendant has to start over again. Corporations win over 90% of the time against people suing for redress.

They lay their eggs in the moth larvae. When the wasp larvae hatch they eat the caterpillar, and instead of moth emerging from the cocoon, a wasp does.\nSimilar parasitic wasps have been found in other parts of Canada, and Noronha was pleased to find them on the Island as well.\n\"That was good news for us, to see first of all to see that they are here,\" she said.\n\"Second that they are widespread and they were actually coming out of these moths.

Federal law governing the possession of fully automatic weapons and such things as sawed-off shotguns has generally been the determinant of which firearms are forbidden. There is only one publicly traded firearms manufacturer in the US that is a clear-cut \"pure\" firearms company, and that is Sturm-Ruger (RGR). They produce beautifully-crafted firearms, none of which ever (to my knowledge) was considered an assault weapon. Then there is Smith & Wesson Holdings (SWHC), but again it produces fully-legal products that are well respected and not accused of being assault weapons. The other operations that handle and sell such things as high-capacity ammo magazines usually import them or have them fabricated by small-scale operations here at home. There is little chance of public ownership of such operations.\nLooking up Remington, Mossberg, Colt, Marlin, Savage, Glock and a number of other makes of guns sold today reveals nothing as far as public ownership. Some are undoubtedly parts of foreign companies or domestic conglomerates, and with some digging one might find the connection. But for the most part such companies are not held by STRS now, so there is little to eliminate from the portfolio.\nThis step is more symbolic than anything else in my opinion. If anyone is really comforted by such symbols, this will go down well. STRS really has better things to do than make symbolic investment changes. It has huge unfunded pension liabilities, and really needs to address those shortfalls.\nJan. 10, 2013 @ 2:20 p.m.\nJan. 11, 2013 @ 9:32 a.m.\nRight. But as you paraphrased this story, it was intended for companies that make a limited class of guns or gun accessories. What I saw there would not affect the aforementioned Sturm Ruger or Smith & Wesson, because they don't make (as far as I can determine) those things. It isn't that it is just any \"gun company\" that they are trying to identify, This isn't a simple thing to implement due to definitional matters and identities.\nJan. 11, 2013 @ 1:02 p.m."}
{"idx": "28405", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Battlezone was first released in 1999 in an interesting mix of FPS and RTS strategy. In it, the player pilots a variety of futuristic vehicles across space, mostly on the outskirts of Pluto, while also building a base to expand and take out the enemy. The game is unique in that it is mostly a 'tank shooter' as the piloting is in general far more important than the strategic aspects of the actual game. The feel of the whole experience is unique under modern standards, but the pacing might turn a few off.\nBattlezone: Combat Commander is a massive re-release and update of a game that first came out in 1999 by Pandemic Studios and Activision, meaning this is nothing new from the original in terms of content. However, graphically it has been completely overhauled, AI has been fixed, and a host of issues across the board have been improved.\nTaking place in the outer parts of the solar system (and the game was originally made when Pluto was still a planet\u2026), the player takes the role of a new military officer sent in to investigate a space outpost that was overrun by alien forces. The first few levels are entirely tutorial in nature, and while the pacing can be slow, the atmosphere is a pretty good setup.\nInserted by a drop ship, the first mission is spent driving around the lifeless planet with the huge starry sky above. A few brief encounters with an unknown enemy set a good tone of mystery for the whole affair. Atmosphere-wise, it helps pull people into the story fairly well.\nThe negative of this, though, is a majority of early missions are very slow, punctuated by periods of very quick combat. Very often it is simply driving around the empty planets, and while cool at first, it starts to become boring. In-between waiting for waves of enemies, there is not much to do. It definitely feels like a '90s title in this regard, compared to modern gameplay, which seems hyperactive by comparison.\nThe actual combat works, but there is not much depth to it. In general, players will be piloting hovercraft or walkers and doing battle with various alien forces. The combat is basically a simple FPS affair, such as Goldeneye. The weapons range from shotguns, lasers, mini-guns, mortars and so on; there is a variety in them, but only a few are actually good. Furthermore, the controls work, but barely; very often combat is simple strafing while firing at the enemy.\nOne of the major annoyances in that combat is very 'bursty' in that an encounter often ends with either very little damage or outright destruction. The way the graphics work when shooting and taking hits, the explosions block nearly the whole screen, which makes it hard to continue firing, and certain enemies can do tremendous damage in a very short period of time. In other encounters, the enemies seem to not have their aiming correct and you can pound mercilessly. The missions typically are only 20-30 minutes, but it is very frustrating losing near the end because of the fast damage from a random enemy.\nStrategy-wise, it is pretty barebones. The player has a base they set up, then various remote mining locations they can set up. From there, they can build various units, like fast scouts, or heavier tanks. The remote locations of mining bring a fun dynamic of wanting more of them, but having a hard time defending them.\nThe mix of aspects is novel (relatively, given its 20 year age) but neither of them particularly shine. They are just average across the board. The strategy never gets that intense, and the shooting"}

That\u2019s soaring, too.\nSo much so, that a Toronto couple raising two children in the city must both work full-time earning $18.52 an hour each to make ends meet, says a new report on Toronto\u2019s living wage.\nThe study, released Friday, updates a 2008 calculation that placed the city\u2019s living wage at $16.60, the hourly sum needed to meet local living expenses.\n\u201c(A living wage) is what\u2019s actually required to live a healthy, sustainable life,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Kaylie Tiessen.\nAccording to the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, sharp increases in the price of basic necessities in Toronto have made it harder for working adults to support their families.\nThe report seeks to provide a \u201cmodest standard\u201d that reflects the reality of everyday living in the city. It argues Ontario\u2019s current $11 minimum wage, set to increase to $11.25 in October, is still insufficient.\nDrawing largely on Statistics Canada and municipal data, the non-profit organization\u2019s research shows a family of four in Toronto needs an annual combined employment income of around $72,000 to afford the basics, such as rent, transportation, child care, food and clothing.\nBoth parents would therefore have to work full-time at $18.52 an hour, after taking into account taxes, government benefits and payroll deductions. The study says the introduction of universal child care and pharmacare would significantly reduce that amount.\nBut many working adults in the city struggle to find jobs that provide economic security, the report shows. While the Toronto area\u2019s median wage was $21 an hour in 2013, the median wage in fast-growing sectors such as retail was only $12.95 an hour.\n\u201cWe do know that purchasing power is a very important part of a strong and growing economy,\u201d said Tiessen.\n\u201cHigher wages are associated with better health, and better health actually means more stamina for workers, more productivity, even happiness and higher well being\u201d she said.\nDUCA Credit Union has taken the same view, and adopted the think tank\u2019s initial $16.60 living wage last fall. It will now update its policy to reflect the organization\u2019s latest calculation. The wage increase will be applied to all 15 of the credit union\u2019s branches in southern Ontario, which employ almost 200 people.\nJayna Vasanjee, 27, began working at a North York DUCA branch six months ago and benefitted from the salary boost. It allowed her to quit her second job and enrol in evening classes to upgrade her skills. She has since earned a promotion and full-time hours with the credit union.\nThe study also argues that a living wage could be incorporated into the City of Toronto\u2019s existing Fair Wage policy, which sets out hourly rates for contract employees. The public sector and non-profit organizations should also consider bringing salaries in line with living wage standards.\nBut some labour activists say the living wage campaign must also push to raise the minimum floor for all workers across the province, not just those living in a particular city or working in specific sectors.\n\u201cThere is this assumption that housing costs in Peterborough, Sudbury and Barrie are lower (than Toronto). But in many cases, they are just as high because affordable housing hasn\u2019t been built in these cities either,\u201d she said.\nTi"}

The board allegedly discussed the possibility of a name change \u2014 which has been hotly debated for years and recently has drawn divided crowds to board meetings \u2014 during the performance evaluation of Superintendent Jason Yamashiro.\n\u201cThe Brown Act prohibits the Dixie Board of Trustees from discussing the Dixie name change in a closed session meeting,\u201d Brekhus wrote.\n\u201cWhile there can be an appropriate nexus between discussing a given subject matter and performance issues in a closed session, Ms. Glickman believes that the conversation left the area of the superintendent\u2019s performance on this matter and instead the Board of Trustees began discussing the name change with no nexus or relation to the superintendent\u2019s handling of the matter,\u201d the letter says.\nThe district staff and board members further violated the Brown Act when a board member referenced the closed-door discussion during a public meeting, and then again when a district staffer attempted to schedule a future closed-session meeting to discuss the name change, the letter states.\nThe Brown Act allows California public officials to discuss staff hiring and performance, pending litigation, employee negotiations and real property negotiations during closed sessions.\nThe law also requires public officials to report action taken in closed session, including who voted and how, \u201cto appoint, employ, dismiss, accept the resignation of, or otherwise affect the employment status of a public employee,\u201d specifying the title of the position and any change in pay.\nGlickman, who has been a vocal proponent of a district name change, declined to comment on the complaint and deferred to Brekhus for comment.\nHonsberger, who is up for re-election Nov. 6, was on vacation and not available for comment.\nThe complaint comes a week after the board voted 4-1, with Glickman dissenting, to take a first step toward a community vote on whether to replace the name \u201cDixie,\u201d which critics say carries the taint of racism or Civil War-era slavery.

They stimulate culture, communication and creativity. They connect people. Concerts, theaters, sporting events, shopping centers, museums, art galleries, restaurants, libraries, clubs\u2014the kinds of endeavors that can only exist where you have enough people\u2014these are benefits that attract people to cities in droves.\nA historic threshold is about to be crossed: By next year, more than half the world\u2019s population\u20143.3 billion people\u2014will live in a city. In China alone, 300 million people are expected to emigrate from the country to the city in the next decade or so. The nation estimates it will have to build 40 new cities over that period just to accommodate them.\nThe trouble is, as all human history testifies, cities also create problems. Some are new: the smog produced by concentrated use of certain modern technologies, for example, or the sterility and dinginess created by pervasive use of concrete and steel. Many, however, are as old as cities themselves: crime, poverty, unemployment, corruption. Most cities around the globe have pressing problems with infrastructure, sanitation, crime or lack of clean water. Many, particularly in the Second and Third World, are also saddled with sprawling, poverty-stricken and lawless shanty towns.\nOfficials working to alleviate these problems score some admirable successes in reducing pollution, increasing safety and reviving dilapidated districts. But it is generally the nature of the modern city\u2014complex, big and boisterous, teeming with people of all stripes\u2014to resist their efforts. The city has a life all its own; it cannot be tamed.\nAre the cities of today the best we will ever see? Thankfully, the answer is no. And it comes from a surprising source.\nReading the plans of great city designers can be stirring. Their descriptions of attractive parks, safe streets, bustling commerce, smartly situated industry, comfortable homes, quality schools, and lively public spaces kindle the imagination with how inviting a properly designed city could be. As they work to improve the quality of city life, politicians, architects, designers and sociologists join Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, and other sharp minds throughout history that have drafted their own plans for urban utopias.\nBut one also can\u2019t help but notice the yawning gap between these abstract ideals and the reality of the cities we inhabit. In the real world, the \u201cperfect city\u201d remains an impossible dream. When planners move to implement their designs, they encounter a maze of obstacles: stubborn pre-existing conditions, political red tape, pressure groups, and of course, economic limitations. Environmental, aesthetic and ergonomic ideals must all yield to the fact that, in a city, space is at a premium, and many people concern themselves primarily with how much revenue that space will produce.\nThe most significant factor working against even the best blueprints is the unpredictability of people. A lovely plaza becomes a lonely hole if people decide not to use it. A new apartment complex for low-income residents becomes an unlivable slum if people trash it. A good neighborhood can become a drug haven if people allow it.\nAnd the choices that determine the difference between a thriving community and a ghetto\u2014made day after day by thousands or even millions of individuals\u2014are an outgrowth of something far less concrete: the character of those people.

He chaired what became known as the Dooge committee which drew up a report to the European Council on the framework for institutional reforms.\nThis was a crucial step on the road towards agreement on the Single European Act which led to agreement among the members of the European Economic Community to form the European Union.\nProf Dooge returned to academic life after retiring from politics and was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy.\nDr Manning said that Prof Dooge\u2019s \u201ccontribution to public life was one of integrity and great intelligence as a minister, senator and adviser to a number of Fine Gael leaders\u201d."}

But a bloody two-day street fight erupted in which the roughly 120 elite U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were vastly outnumbered by Somali gunmen. In the end, 18 soldiers were killed, 73 were wounded and two Army Black Hawk helicopters were shot down.\nThe American military's role in Somalia originally intended to support U.N. humanitarian operations, but the Pentagon made a quick exit after that battle -- which became of the most famous in recent decades and helped shape U.S. foreign policy and military strategy.\nEarlier this year, Struecker and fellow Ranger Keni Thomas, now a country musician, returned to Somalia \u2013 still an extremely dangerous place \u2013 to revisit their bloody encounter with Somali militia fighters and film a documentary about their experience.\n\u201cKenny said: \u2018I'll go if you go.\u2019 I said: \u2018I'll if you go,\u201d Struecker said.\nTheir film \"Return to Mogadishu,\" which you can watch above, was released last month.\nStruecker, who also served many tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army chaplain, spoke with America Tonight about the battle that changed his life, what it was like reliving it and why he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever return to Somalia.\nWhat pulled you back to Somalia?\nWe wanted this documentary to be real and very gripping.

I don't know what kind of emotions though. It could be bad.\nI'm clearly a different man. Mogadishu had a very significant impact on me. Keni remarks something similar: \u201cI'm almost incomplete.\u201d I think it was part of trying to bring some closure.\nHow did that battle change you?\nI had a very strong Christian faith before joining the Army. It gave me this overwhelming sense of peace when most people were around me panicking. The next day, many people were asking me how I kept it together. God was leading me. I became an Army chaplain. It was directly a result of the day after this battle in Mogadishu.\nHow did your experience in Somalia shape your work as a chaplain?\nWhat were your emotions like when you returned to Mogadishu?\nI remember very vividly most of the events of Black Hawk Down. I always have. When I got back to Black Hawk Down, emotions flooded back the whole time I was there.

These insects are not there, they are disappearing.\"\nThe first vaccine inoculates bees against American foulbrood, a globally spread disease that can kill entire colonies and whose spores can remain viable for more than 50 years. The technology may in future be used to combat fungal diseases and other bacterial infections.\nThe vaccine is administered via an edible sugar patty that is suspended in the hive for the queen to consume over seven to 10 days. After she ingests the pathogens, she is able to spark an immune response in her offspring, eventually generating an inoculated hive.\nThe vaccine still needs a lot of work before it can become commercially available. Scientists must ensure it's safe for the environment, the bees themselves and humans who consume the honey. Regulatory hurdles will take years to clear. It's also too early to estimate how much beekeepers will have to shell out to buy inoculated hives, Freitak said.\nWhile yields for potatoes, rice, wheat, and other crops that don't need pollination may also benefit from more bees, vitamin-rich fruits such as apples, tomatoes and citruses won't deliver a crop without them, Freitak said.\n\"The problem really touches all of us,\" she said. \"We have to start tackling it from all sides.\""}

But they are, and so two years ago, Steve and Perry did a bunch of research and then Steve built a cider press. Over the last couple of autumns, they\u2019ve honed cider pressing into an fine art and an assembly-line process, figuring out a quick and efficient way to reduce the picked, washed, and quartered apples (wormy parts removed) into a slurry.\nSteve Benoit works the cider press he built by hand (Susan Clotfelter, The Denver Post).\nThat essential, but totally unglamorous, step now uses an old stainless kitchen sink and a three-quarter-horse garbage disposal. The chopped apples are dumped into the sink, pushed through the garbage disposal, and then a five-gallon-bucket of apple mash at a time goes through the press.\nIt takes nearly a village to make a big batch of cider, unless you\u2019ve got a factory. With Steve\u2019s operation running at full efficiency, it takes two to run the cider press, three or four to chop apples, one to feed them into the grinder. And it doesn\u2019t hurt to have an eighth person just running buckets back and forth, swabbing the chopping table and keeping things relatively clean so that the operation doesn\u2019t send out an engraved invitation to every yellowjacket nest in five counties. Plus a crew of eight people is generally pretty grateful if there are yet a few more people cooking something up in the background. Cider pressing, of course, can\u2019t even begin until after those apple trees get picked, which is a multi-week labor of love and muscle-straining itself.\nIt was fun, messy and exhausting. We made cinnamon doughnuts, pumpkin biscotti, and then cooked a stew over Steve and Paula\u2019s firepit. This year I was thrilled that crabapples from my own tree will be part of one batch. I don\u2019t brew, but I\u2019ve chopped and cleaned and picked most years and this year, helped to work the press, which involves getting coated in apple mash up past my elbows, scooping it into the pressing form as another person pours it from the other side of the press.\nThe pressed juice gets put into sanitized glass carboys, dosed with yeast and left to ferment. My part of the cider pressing process, other than helping with cleanup and eating Paula\u2019s Dutch-oven stew, is done. I know that at some point the cider gets bottled and caped and set in the dark, cool basement of Steve and Paula\u2019s four-level garage/workshop, another \u201clittle\u201d project they built, again mostly by hand and themselves.

The company wants to drill from a well pad in the neighboring community of Economy into Franklin Park.\nIf the borough had approved the proposal, the company could have drilled wells that extend horizontally underground below Linbrook Park, a local green space with soccer fields, baseball diamonds and a disc golf course.\nPennEnergy can still drill in the vicinity, but it will have to go around the park in areas where it has signed leases with private mineral owners.\nNumerous residents on both sides of the matter voiced their opinions in front of the council, including Monday at a hearing and again Wednesday. No council member made a comment before the vote.\nWhen the council rejected the lease late Wednesday night, the room erupted in applause from those who opposed drilling.\nFranklin Park is the latest example of a Pittsburgh suburb grappling with shale gas development.\nMany Franklin Park residents spoke out against the proposal to drill under Linbrook Park, saying they worried about environmental and health problems associated with fracking.\nPennEnergy\u2019s vice president of land, Zach Dixon, addressed those concerns in front of the council.\n\u201cThe company does not believe we have the right to pollute the environment in pursuit of commerce,\u201d he said.\nOther residents urged the council to sign the lease.

The 92-year-old woman has lived in her home in Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos for 23 of the 27 years she has been in the United States. Now, she is preparing to move.\n\"We don't know what will ... happen here,\" Cayabyab said.\nFor more than a year, Lennar Homes has been working on plans to demolish Cayabyab's home and the 321 other homes that surround it, called Pe\u00f1asquitos Village. The developer wants to build 601 houses, townhomes, condos and apartments on site, along with swimming pools, spas and tennis courts. Twenty-eight of the apartments are to be reserved for low-income people, according to the project's draft environmental analysis.\nThe project, called Pacific Village, is scheduled to go before the San Diego Planning Commission next month. The City Council has final say over its approval.\nCayabyab, who depends on Social Security Income and a Section 8 housing voucher to pay her rent, is confident she will not be able to afford any of the new units. She said she likes her neighborhood because it is quiet and has no crime, and because she is friends with her neighbors.\n\"Our neighborhood is good,\" she said.\nThe planned demolition and redevelopment of Pe\u00f1asquitos Village, built in 1970, has been years in the making \u2014 and it could be a harbinger of what is in store for thousands of other homes in San Diego County set to lose their affordability status. The property's owner agreed to reserve the homes for low-income renters under a federal program that ran from 1990 to 1996, city officials said, but that agreement expired in 2010. Many of the low-income tenants were given Section 8 housing vouchers that allowed them to stay in their homes, despite their rent going up.\nNow, in a market with skyrocketing housing costs, the owner stands to make more money off the property renting newer, nicer homes to wealthier tenants. And from the city's perspective, the additional 279 homes the redevelopment would bring are an opportunity to increase the overall housing supply and relieve some of the pressure on San Diego's tight housing market.\nMatt Schwartz, president and CEO of the California Housing Partnership, said the housing market is seeing a \"cascade of terminations\" of affordability agreements, as many of the programs to fund them are coming to an end all at once. About 2,400 homes in San Diego County for low-income renters \u2014 or just over 7 percent of the county's existing affordable housing stock \u2014 are set to become market rate within five years. That number nearly doubles within the next 10 years.\n\"Those owners are now free to do, or freer to do what they want with the properties,\" Schwartz said. \"We're starting to see a bit of a perfect storm come together.\"\nA map shows how many homes reserved for low-income renters in San Diego County are at risk of becoming market rate in the coming decade.\nCompounding the risk for low-income renters is anemic growth in new housing production, which for years has failed to keep pace with population and job growth.

Cavan, I set out to learn its story.\nSandwiched between the Woodford and Blackwater rivers lies an area of Co. Cavan known as Magh Slecht (pronounced Moy Shlokht). Overlooked by the scenic Cuilcagh Mountain and distant rounded shoulders of Sliabh an Iarainn, this panoramic vista of gently rolling countryside is packed with an unusually dense concentration of megalithic monuments, including cairns, stone rows and circles, standing stones, fort enclosures, and burial sites.\nI went to meet local historian Oliver Brady, who recently assisted on an archaeological investigation of the region.\nWe first went to see a replica of the Killycluggin Stone, which is located on the side of the Ballyconnell - Ballinamore road only 320 yards from where it was found. The original can now be seen in the County Cavan Museum in Ballyjamesduff.\nThe stone\u2019s surface is covered in simplistic scrolling designs of the Iron Age La Tene style, and, Mr. Brady suggests, was probably once richly decorated with gold and colorful paint. These carvings look somewhat like stylized faces to me, or birds, but they have never been definitively interpreted. It looked very\u2026 well\u2026 innocent and unassuming, if such a thing can be said of a stone, particularly one with such a dark and turbulent history.\nThis particular stone was discovered buried in the ground in pieces in 1921 by the landowner, close to the Bronze Age stone circle at Killycluggin. It is thought that originally it would have stood at the center of the stone circle, which currently consists of eighteen standing stones, many of them fallen, and has a diameter of 72 ft.\nTall trees now encircle the stones protectively, casting them into deep shadow. Moss has draped a delicate mantle of soft green over them, shielding them from sight, and brambles bristle like a guard of honor; if you didn\u2019t know what you were looking for, you could be forgiven for missing it altogether. A fine view of Cuilcagh dominates the horizon to the north, and the two entrance stones, once proud but now recumbent, look towards the rising sun in the east.\nThe circle and the stone share a dark and mysterious past, according to Irish mythology, for they have been identified as the site of pagan human sacrifice and the worship of the Sun God, Crom Cruach.\nCrom Cruach is also known as Crom Dubh, or Cenn Cruach, among other names. The meaning is elusive; Crom means \u2018bent, crooked, or stooped\u2019, while Cenn refers to the head, but also means \u2018chief, leader\u2019. Cruach could mean \u2018bloody, gory, slaughter\u2019 and also \u2018corn-stack, heap, mound\u2019.\nWe know that there was a cult which worshiped the stone heads of their patron Gods and Goddesses in other areas of Co. Cavan from finds such as the Corleck head, although nothing similar has been recorded as being found at Magh Slecht.\nThe ancient Irish considered the head as \u2018the seat of the soul\u2019, and warriors were said to have collected"}

{"idx": "28454", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The year 1973 was a good one for Elvis Presley. He was riding high from the success of the Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite TV broadcast and live album; he had signed a new record deal with his label, RCA; and he was the beneficiary of a $5 million buyout of his back catalog from the label. While that buyout ultimately may have been a bad deal for Presley, at the time it gave him the financial freedom to live the way he was accustomed to. In addition, his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, had formed a new publishing company, which freed Presley to choose what he felt was stronger material to record. In short, life was good. This being the world of Elvis Presley, it wasn\u2019t without its complications, however.\nPresley\u2019s relentless touring schedule had left him exhausted. He was separated from Priscilla during this time, and his daughter was scheduled to visit him that July. The problem was, RCA decided they needed new material from Presley during that time and he was forced to accommodate him. American Studios, where Presley had so much success with songs such as \u201cSuspicious Minds\u201d just a few years earlier, had closed down, but another hometown label, Stax, was thriving during this period. Presley knew of Stax and its success, and its proximity to Graceland couldn\u2019t be beat, so he scheduled sessions for July and December of that year. A plethora of material was recorded \u2014 enough for nearly three complete albums \u2014 and RCA, as they were apt to do, spread the material out over multiple releases. Elvis At Stax, a new 3-CD collection of Stax masters and alternate takes, attempts to rectify this, putting all the masters and many notable outtakes in one place and offering a fresh look at these sessions.\nThe sessions proved fruitful, providing material for three albums: Raised On Rock, Good Times, and Promised Land. While all the songs from the latter two releases are included here, \u201cI Miss You\u201d and \u201cAre You Sincere\u201d are missing from Raised On Rock, as those tracks were not recorded at Stax. Still, the collection presents two complete albums and nearly a third, plus a multitude of outtakes. While many of these outtakes have been previously released on various box sets or the acclaimed FTD series, Elvis At Stax cherry picks many of the best of these tracks and presents them in one place.\nRather than order the original albums as they were released, the songs are instead presented thematically. Disc one contains 17 R&B and country outtakes, while disc two features 10 pop outtakes. The remainder of disc two includes all of the July 1973 masters while disc three is comprised of the December 1973 masters. Ordering the tracks in this fashion allows the material to be viewed in a different light.

{"idx": "28455", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: On tonight's Wild Breakaway, Audra Martin and Wes Walz break down Minnesota Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk's spectacular performance in a 2-1 shootout loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.\nAUDRA MARTIN: Welcome to \"Wild Breakaway,\" alongside Wes Walz. I'm Audra Martin.\nLast season, the Wild were perfect three for three against the Vegas Golden Knights, and for the majority of this home opener tonight for the Wild it looks like they were going to go four for four. But unfortunately, the Golden Knights, a very talented team, they took advantage of an opportunity, forcing overtime to eventual shootout, and the visitors come out on top, winning it 2-1 in the shootout.\n- Yeah, I thought the Wild come out at home-- obviously, any time you're playing at home, you want to come out and show your fans you're ready to go. I thought the first five, six, seven minutes of the game, the Wild did have a lot of jump early in the game. They were able to get a big goal fired by Matt Dumba to take the 1-0 lead into the end of the first period.\nSecond period, the Minnesota Wild started to turn over a lot of pucks, the ice really started to tilt. And Devan Dubnyk was unbelievable in the second period. Made four or five grade A point blank chances to keep this at 1-0. They lost the face off with about a minute and a half left in the third period. And when they had five players-- six players on the ice with the goalie out and they were unable to keep the puck out of their net.\nYou know, tough one any time you give up a goal late and not winning in overtime. I know they got a point, but it kind of feels like a loss right now. But the Minnesota Wild have a couple of days off right now, so they can work on some things in practice and get right. They're just a little off right now.\n- All right. Well, here's a look at tonight's final stats for the second straight game. Wild giving up 40 plus shots on net, 30 for the Minnesota Wild. Last season, they did have one of the best home penalty kills in the league. And it looks like that's picking up right where they left, off killing off all three of their penalties here tonight, but they go over to on the man advantage.\nBut once again, tonight, Devan Dubnyk, the best player on the ice for the Minnesota Wild, keeping his team in this one late. And here's what the head coach had to say about his net minder.\n- He's seen the puck-- I mean, touch wood, we don't want it to stop, but two years ago, he had this way-- this kind of game until March where he, you know, win us hockey games on his own. And right now, he's playing as well as anybody. To have only one point and his goals against is 1.5 is not fair to him.\nAUDRA MARTIN: So the Wild will look for their first win of the season when they get back to work on Thursday, welcoming the Chicago Blackhawks to town. We get back to central division action we always know it is very exciting.\nAnd this is a Chicago team with a lot of pressure on them right now. They had a very off season last year. Bounced right away in the postseason, 2017. Everybody knows they're kind of on high alert. They got to have a good showing, because there could"}

A victim of its own popularity, the classic route to Machu Picchu had become so heavily traveled and littered with garbage that the Peruvian government was forced to step in and regulate it. There are now strict quotas on the number of hikers - to get one of the coveted slots you must plan many months ahead - and a long list of rules aimed at reducing wear and tear on the fragile landscape.\nIn response, trekkers and local outfitters have been eagerly scouting alternate hiking routes to Machu Picchu. The most popular is the Salcantay Trek, a five-day, 38-mile journey that stitches together burro trails and old Inca roads across the lofty spine of the Cordillera Vilcabamba. It's higher and somewhat more rugged than the Inca Trail, and, while rapidly growing in reputation, it currently sees far less traffic. Other than a group we passed on the first day, we never saw any other hikers.\nWhat sets the Salcantay Trek apart is the option, if you've the desire and disposable income, to walk from one supremely comfortable lodge to the next, spending each night on 400-count sheets, dining on sophisticated cuisine and choosing from a wine list that's surprisingly extensive, considering it all has to come in on the backs of burros.\nOpened last year by a local outfitter called Mountain Lodges of Peru, the lodges are aimed squarely at aging Baby Boomers who crave what's come to be called \"soft adventure.\" If my group was any indication, they're just the thing for fit, active people who want a little adventure but can't abide sleeping bags, cold showers and squat toilets.\nFrom the old Inca capital of Cuzco, the half-day drive to the trailhead took us past one of the headwaters of the Amazon River, alongside terraced mountainsides reminiscent of Nepal and through lively market towns where the abundant produce made Whole Foods look like a gas station Kwickee Mart.\nGreen, scalloped mountains disappeared into the mist above us as we began our walk in a wispy drizzle.

It concerns one Jeffrey Herman, a longtime substitute teacher. He is a bit miffed because he\u2019s been blackballed by the headmaster of English High School. He says he is being punished for his political beliefs, and he just might be right.\nMr. Herman is apparently no fan of the military and the present administration. Last year, he had his students write letters to President Bush discussing his performance as president (no word on whether they were steered towards criticizing him). Also, at a public meeting last month, Herman urged the school to discontinue its JROTC program.\nThe problem is that the headmaster of the school, Jose Duarte, is an Army Reservist who said at that meeting that critics of the JROTC program should \u201cjust get a life.\u201d Also, Mr. Duarte opens each school day with reveille played over the PA system.\nIt\u2019s a tough call. I think thatMr. Herman is wrong in his political beliefs, and a bit of an asshat to boot. But his statements were made at a public forum, and everyone should have the right to speak freely at such events.\nHowever, if he let his politics stray over into the classroom, and was proseltyzing the students into bashing Bush for credit, then Mr. Duarte is fully within his rights to ban him from teaching at the school. In fact, he would be remiss in his duties if he did not.\nThe story doesn\u2019t give enough details for me to decide.\nI think the most refreshing element of this story is that the idea of a conservative Army reservist serving as a school administrator. I was convinced that nearly every one of those were liberals, wimps, droning bureaucrats, or some combination of all three.\nHave you seen this yet?\nBlogger Bill Hobbs canned by his employer, Belmont University, for drawing a Mohammed cartoon.\nI read the title of this one so fast I thought it said \u201cretard\u201d. I guess that works.\nI had the misfortune of working for this headmaster for four long years at English High. Although the substitute in question is as crazy as the day is long and should not be allowed anywhere near children, this is typical behavior by the headmaster. His strength is bullying people in order to get what he wants. Headmaster Duarte is a vile human being and borders on clinically insane."}

We love the mountains and the desert. We love the people. We love the increasing diversity and energy of Salt Lake City. We even love the interesting and unique culture. In our opinion, there is no better place to live.\nBut on some levels, a kind of divided, two-sided, competition-mixed-with-animosity division persists.\nPart of it is fun, like the strong rivalry between the University of Utah and Brigham Young University (although this gets a bit extreme at times). Other parts are more troubling. Any time we generalize and try to shove everything into two categories, there are problems, sometimes very offensive ones. Too often it seems that people try to fit everyone either into the Mormon, conservative, insular, judgmental insider category or into the non-Mormon, liberal, anything-goes outsider category.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t work. It is based on stereotypes and oversimplification.\nIn reality, there are those who are both Mormon and politically liberal. And there are orthodox members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who cheer for the U. And there are East Coast transplants that love the safe, conservative atmosphere in the neighborhoods in which they have chosen to live.\nThere are hundreds of categories, not just two.\nThere is little that is wrong with the reality of Utah and the wonderful and nuanced combination of people and places that we have here. What is wrong is the oversimplified perceptions that seem to never go away.\nWe have had an in-and-out relationship with Utah for most of our adult lives. I (Richard) grew up in Logan, and Linda grew up over the mountain in Montpelier, Idaho. We met and fell in love at Utah State University and got married while I was in graduate school at BYU before we left together for Boston and Harvard.\nEver since, we have been in and out. We lived in London for four years and for a time we spent some years in Washington, D.C., and some years in Salt Lake City. Now we travel a lot with our work but call Utah our home base.\nThe point is that we see Utah\u2019s unique society and culture from the vantage points of both insiders and outsiders.\nAnd it is unique; some would say strange, some would say wonderful. And both would be right. Some perceive that our liquor laws are different, and so are our big families, and even the three-hour Mormon Sunday meetings.

We accept others for who they are and we all learn from each other. We are united by the fact that we all know, on some level, that we are pretty lucky to live here and that on many levels we have the best of most everything.\nWe think it is important for everyone to avoid the divided-society paradigm and to work to overcome it in every way they can.

It denied him a place in history and the Lions completing a comeback of unprecedented magnitude.\nDespite Phil Vickery's mangling in the scrum and the equally grotesque sight of giving the Springboks six first-half shots at goal in half an hour of recurring technical indiscipline, the Lions almost wiped out a 19-point deficit in a recovery based on two late tries when they might easily have had four.\nNobody will ever know what kind of a shattering effect that would have had on the World Cup holders but one of their most celebrated figures knew how close they came when he saw the replays of the Monye tries that never were.\nMonye could do the sums for himself which is why he, as a God-fearing young man, will be praying for a shot at redemption in Pretoria on Saturday.\n'I know how crucial that was because we lost by five points,' he said.\nGoing for the left corner, Monye ignored the basic principle of tucking the ball into his outside arm, the left, and held it in the inside arm, the right. Small issues make big differences at this level and that allowed Jean de Villiers to make a cover tackle of almost miraculous proportion, the Springbok centre burrowing beneath Monye before scooping the ball up and raising it aloft.\nIt took the best part of three minutes for that to become apparent and the video referee, Christophe Berdos of France, to rule no try. 'If I had my time again, it would have been a simple case of tucking it under my left arm and diving over,' Monye said.\n'At the time I didn't think that was necessary otherwise I'd have transferred it to my left and looked to fend off with the right but I didn't think he was in a position to make the tackle. Hats off to him, that was fantastic defence.\nMonye's second near-miss, four minutes after Tom Croft's second try, came at the height of a sensational final quarter when Jamie Roberts and the Lions ran riot. They won more than enough penalties in rapid succession from Bryce Lawrence and the only explanation for the New Zealand referee's dogged refusal to use his yellow card was that he had left it in the dressing-room.\nAmid increasing Springbok desperation, Monye was about to apply the formality of touching the ball down after stepping inside the last line of defence until substitute fly-half Morne Steyn jolted the ball from his grasp.\nThe Lions will claim that they reduced the Springboks to disarray. Not wholly true because Peter de Villiers, the maverick coach with a propensity for the illogical, helped create that disarray with a series of bizarre substitutions. Assuming that the game had been won at 26-7, de Villiers began his tinkering with 23 minutes still to go.\nIn rapid succession he withdrew one lock followed by both props, including skipper John Smit.

The top court ordered Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal to pay 100 million won each to four victims of forced labor, saying they had a right to compensation despite the 1965 treaty signed between the two nations to resolve colonial-era issues.\nIn the Mitsubishi case, five survivors of forced labor and one family of a deceased victim filed for damages in 2000 for making the six men work at its Hiroshima munitions and shipbuilding plant without pay in 1944. But as the legal fight dragged on, the five survivors all passed away and the families continued with the lawsuits.\nThe female victims filed for damages in 2012, claiming they were tricked into joining the Korean Women\u2019s Volunteer Corps and were forced to work without pay at a Mitsubishi aircraft plant in Nagoya, Japan, in 1944.\nThey sued the Japanese company in Japan, but that country\u2019s highest court ruled in favor of Mitsubishi in 2008.\n\u201cI lived all my life in tears, and could not say anything.

In seconds, the speeding train smashes into their van, killing six children and the driver and injuring over a dozen. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu tweets: Avoidable tragedy.\nDec 5: Two children are killed and three others injured when a speeding train smashes into a tractor at a manned level crossing in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Hardoi district. Driver allegedly threatened the gate man to open the gates. Gateman opens the gates. Railway Minister in a press release: Has given instructions to suspend gateman.\nManned or unmanned, railway level crossings presently numbering 30,348 are becoming a death trap for travellers. The fatalities are nearing the hundred mark in about 35 accidents since April this year. As per latest statistics, 90 people were killed and 69 injured in 33 accidents between April and November this year. In 2013-14, 95 were killed in 46 incidents while there were 124 fatalities in 53 accidents in 2012-13.\nAnother 204 died in 54 accidents in 2011-12. The numbers may appear less compared to accidents and fatalities on roads. But the level crossings contribute to 40 per cent of rail accidents and 30 per cent of fatalities.\nIt would be unfair to point fingers at Prabhu for doing nothing to arrest this trend at this stage, as he occupied the hot seat only a month ago. Railways has massive information on the accidents and it might have already briefed the minister, \u201cRight of Way\u201d at unmanned crossings and provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, putting the onus on road users.\nOf course, the onus is on the road users to ensure their safety. It is also true that many a time, the Railways cannot be blamed for accidents at the level crossings. Carelessness and highhandedness, as seen in this month\u2019s incidents, of drivers and travellers contribute a lot to such incidents.\nThe Motor Vehicles Act 1988 makes it mandatory for road vehicle drivers \u201cto get down from the vehicle, walk up to the crossing to ensure that no train is approaching from either side before crossing the unmanned level crossing\u201d.\nHowever, can the Railways stay aloof from such accidents and not speed up suggested measures like eliminating the number of level crossings?

Barr wrote that he shares Nadler's desire to ensure Congress and the public can read the Mueller report, said the department would release it by mid-April, and offered to testify publicly before both the House and Senate.\nNadler's response was more tart. He repeated a demand that Barr provide the full report, without redactions, by Tuesday. And he insisted that the Justice Department assist Congress in seeking a court order to release all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee.\nNone of this will happen, as Nadler surely knows. Most notably, a careful reading of Barr's two letters strongly suggests that the cooperative veneer is just that. The department likely will redact all grand jury information before turning over the report and likely will rebuff Nadler's request to work cooperatively to urge the district court to authorize disclosure of grand jury material to his committee.\nMueller's investigation made extensive use of the grand jury. The Justice Department, with Mueller's help, is identifying all grand-jury material in the report. Grand-jury material includes the testimony transcripts, of course, but also an array of other items such as exhibits that might tend to reveal the identities of witnesses or jurors.\nBarr's letters advance a strict view of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E), which limits disclosure of information from grand jury proceedings to five specific situations. The exceptions all relate roughly to a given, ongoing prosecution or related ones; none of them comfortably covers a disclosure to Congress for consideration in oversight or impeachment hearings, although there are a few scattered cases holding otherwise.\nThe coming legal battle will be waged over whether the exceptions in the rule are exclusive. Some courts have determined that the list is not strictly limited in that way, and in particular that district courts have inherent supervisory authority to order release in a case of \"special circumstances\" in which there is a significant public interest in the material. Plainly, that fits the Mueller report.\nAnyone familiar with Barr's jurisprudential views would safely guess that he is unlikely to reverse Justice Department policy and urge the courts to recognize an extra-textual \"inherent authority\" in the federal courts to order disclosure.\nNadler, along with many other proponents of full release to Congress, invoke the Watergate precedent. In that case, the court permitted special prosecutor Leon Jaworski to supply the \"road map\" bare-bones summary of key evidence to the House Judiciary Committee that became a basis for that body's impeachment inquiry.\nBut there are several features of the Watergate precedent that don't apply to release of Mueller's grand jury information. Most important, the court approving the transmission to the House concluded that it was only President Richard Nixon whose rights of confidentiality were seriously implicated, and Nixon didn't object to the report's release. But with Mueller, the overall antagonism between the special counsel's office and the subjects and targets of the probe guarantees that several uncharged third parties (e.g., Donald Trump Jr.) would oppose disclosure.

Rick Perry addresses the 40th annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) March 14, 2013 in National Harbor, Maryland.\nI endorse the Slatepitchy theory behind Michael Catalini\u2019s story about Rick Perry. The last time most Americans saw Perry, he was a Peter Sellers sketch, a bumbling Aggie idiot blowing every possible advantage in order to lose the Iowa caucuses and narrowly edge past Buddy Roemer in New Hampshire. So why not ask whether he can come back? If Mark Sanford can come back, can\u2019t Rick Perry?\nHa, ha, no. The big problem is that the people praising Rick Perry in this story worked for Rick Perry. We hear from Perry\u2019s former chief of staff (\u201cI think he remains a motivated public official and an energized political figure\u201d), Perry\u2019s former campagn aide (\u201c[Hispanics] see his commitment to inclusion\u201d), a former campaign consultant (\"Making a first impression a second time is always difficult\u201d), and eventually a guy who worked against Perry in 2010 but lives in Austin and wasn\u2019t too mean to the guv on Twitter. Shouldn\u2019t a reassessment of Perry\u2019s strength find one person in the broader GOP who agrees that, yes, Perry might be a good candidate in 2016?\nMaybe that\u2019s not the standard. \u201cIt\u2019s striking that [Perry] was campaigning on many of the reforms that Republican Party leaders are now desperately pushing,\u201d writes Catalini. The examples?\nEventual GOP nominee Mitt Romney hammered Perry for his support of in-state tuition for undocumented workers in Texas. That was in 2012. Now Republican standard-bearers Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have changed the GOP\u2019s tune on immigration.\nBut have they endorsed the idea of in-state tuition for illegal immigrants? No.\nPerry also staked out a critical position on entitlement reform, memorably comparing Social Security to a Ponzi scheme in his book. Romney attacked Perry for his positions, but then later tapped Paul Ryan, the Republican leader on entitlement reform, as his running mate. Now Republicans are united on the belief that trimming entitlement benefits is necessary to get the budget under control.\nBut neither this year\u2019s Ryan budget nor the last two Ryan budgets calls for any reform of Social Security. The Republican theory of entitlements, and entitlement politics, is that benefits currently paid to senior citizens should be paid, or plussed up (i.e., reversing the cost reforms and cuts of Obamacare), and people under 55 should have reduced benefits.\nThese were screw-ups that revealed plenty about the GOP in 2012. They didn\u2019t reveal that Perry was miles ahead of the conservative wing."}

O\u2019Reilly\u2019s thinking seemed to go something like this: a politically-motivated maniac tried to shoot up the FRC (but only succeeded in wounding a security guard) and the liberal media thought it no big deal. Therefore, that proved that when a politically-motivated maniac shot and killed Dr. Tiller, the harsh (liberal media) spotlight on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric was simply more liberal-bias baloney. Unfortunately for O\u2019Reilly, FRC head Tony Perkins was more interested in blaming the Southern Poverty Law Center, a staunch critic of the FRC, for \u201ccreating an environment that led\u201d to the shooting than he was in attacking the media.\n\u201cYou may remember back in 2009, some in the liberal press accused me of encouraging the assassination of late-term abortionist George Tiller,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said in a discussion with Perkins last night. He went on to play a video of another abortion doctor saying that O\u2019Reilly had engaged in \u201chate speech\u201d that was \u201cdesigned to get Dr. Tiller killed and it worked.\u201d (Note: I removed the clip from the video below to avoid copyright infringement. But you can watch it in its original context, in a report on Dr. Tiller\u2019s killing on the PBS show, NOW.\nThese instances and others we reviewed clearly show that O'Reilly was not reporting the views of others, but was expressing his own views on the doctor.\nTo get a fuller flavor of just how inflammatory O\u2019Reilly\u2019s rhetoric really was, check out this video mashup put together by Daily Kos\u2019 Jed Lewison.\nI hate to say it, Bill, but you\u2019re wrong again.

Priscilla has more on just why the Family Research Council has been designated as a hate group.\nO\u2019Reilly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t exacerbate that situation,\u201d meaning with Dr. Tiller, but added that he will \u201ccheck that out absolutely\u201d about the SPLC.\nHe continued complaining about the \u201cscant\u201d media coverage of the FRC shooting. As O\u2019Reilly ran down the shooter's liberal bona fides (he volunteered at a gay clinic, he had lots of sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A with him), it was clear where O\u2019Reilly was trying to go: The liberal media only cares about liberals getting killed and they only \u201cwent after\u201d him because of their anti-conservative agenda.\nMemo to Bill O\u2019Reilly: Why don\u2019t you just come clean about the demonizing you did, do some kind of atonement and stop trying to defend what was really indefensible?

Patients with this neuromuscular disorder can have several types of symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, swallowing and climbing stairs, as well as double vision and facial paralysis.\nThese symptoms result from the immune system producing antibodies that block or damage the acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. MedlinePlus noted that no cure for myasthenia gravis exists, though the treatments for the disorder can extend periods in which the patient does not have symptoms.\nOne treatment option for myasthenia gravis is medication. Medications such as anticholinesterase agents help with neuromuscular transmission. Examples of anticholinesterase agents include pyridostigmine and neostigmine.\nBy improving the communication between the muscles and the nerves, these medications can help increase the patient\u2019s muscle strength. Side effects of these medications include frequent urination and gastrointestinal upset.\nAnother option for medication is immunosuppressive drugs. As myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder, this type of medication works by suppressing the immune system\u2019s production of the antibodies that affect the acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. Examples of immunosuppressive drugs for myasthenia gravis include tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and cyclosporine.\nWhile these immunosuppressive drugs can help reduce symptoms, the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke warned that they can cause major side effects, such as liver damage and infertility, and must be monitored closely by a physician.\nCorticosteroids also suppress the immune system and can help with the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, though these medications can cause diabetes, bone thinning, and an increase and redistribution of the patient\u2019s body fat.\nSurgery is another treatment option, especially for patients who have a tumor in their thymus gland, which is about 15 percent of myasthenia gravis patients, according to the MayoClinic.com.\nWhat are the Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis?"}

{"idx": "28498", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Fitbit Force Recall Is Bad News For The Company And Wearable Tech, But Is It Necessary?\nWhat started as a voluntary recall on February 20, became a more official one yesterday, when the Consumer Product Safety Commission posted an official notice that the Fitbit Force is off the market. Technically, you can no longer list your Force on eBay or Craiglist, which puts you in the same boat as the company. Fitbit stopped selling the device with its announcement several weeks ago. The San Francisco-based startup was a clear leader in wearables, with Canalys estimating it had more than half the market, well ahead of competitors Jawbone and Nike. The recall clearly has left a huge opening for those competitors to close the gap, but how much advantage can be gained in a situation like this?\nThe recall provided a rare insight into the success of the Force. The CPSC report tells us that Fitbit sold 1 million units in the U.S. and 28,000 in Canada. The device went on sale last October and I reviewed it favorably, as did many others. Unfortunately, some have had a negative experience wearing it. Fitbit told the CPSC that there were 9,900 reports of \"skin irritation\" and 250 more of \"blistering.\" Those figures don't quite add up with the company's original statement that 1.7% of users reported a problem, but perhaps the numbers the government used were slightly out of date.\nLike Luke Skywalker, it may take time for people to trust in the Force again.\nEither way, a wrist-worn device that's making 1 in 100 customers unable to keep it on is not going to cut it. But as to what's causing the problem, well that's another matter. Fitbit says testing indicates the problem is contact dermatitis. That's a catch-all term for red or inflamed skin brought on by irritants or allergies. The company says the device is made of standard materials, none of which should be especially allergy-causing. There is a bit of surgical grade stainless steel on the back of the device and that does contain nickel, a fairly common allergen. But nickel in that type of steel shouldn't be allergenic, per the Mayo Clinic. The Fitbit's band contains nothing unusual either, though the company speculates something in the material or the adhesive could be causing people trouble.\nRealistically, a likely cause is customer behavior. The Fitbit is somewhat water resistant and the company encourages wearing it all day to track your activity and sleep. Because of this, it's pretty easy to trap soap and whatever else one might encounter under or around the band. (Soaps and moisturizers are among the common irritants that cause contact dermatitis.) Keep that pressed against the skin long enough and some people will develop nasty skin conditions. What Fitbit can't do, however, is blame customers. Despite raising about $50 million in venture capital, it's a young company in a young industry. An arrogant or defensive posture is exactly the kind of thing that might bring on aggressive lawsuits. And enough time -- and money -- lost in the courtroom could kill the company.\nIt's even possible that some people have developed a skin irritation that's psychogenic in nature. Once they first got wind of the fact that the Fitbit was making people ill, they too could have become ill. This kind of thing really happens.\nNow, it's important to clarify: I don't really know what"}

They are pushing the First ELSE as a portable device capable of fulfilling a number of connected roles, but not centred around the phone. Company CEO, Amir Kupervas, called out Apple's iPhone, pointing out that it was named around the \"phone\" and that at all times the phone took prominence.\nThe differentiation perhaps doesn't go much further than marketing: it will be sold as a mobile phone, in mobile phone outlets and supported by the mobile phone network. We'll call it a mobile phone and so will everyone else.\nIn recent times we\u2019ve seen a shift in mobile phone marketing to focus on applications and services, not just hardware. Windows Mobile is doing it with its giant application icons and Apple has been saying \"there's an app for that\" for yonks: it's fun, it's light hearted. The teaser video for the First ELSE plays out like something from a Tom Clancy movie. You expect to see Matt Damon stroking a PSG-1. It's the stuff of thrillers.\nBut is the handset itself thrilling?\nThe hardware specs are fairly typical. It measures 115.6 x 56.6 x 13mm, fairly average dimensions, if not a little on the long side. That gives you a 3.5-inch, 854 x 480 pixel resolution, display. It's a capacitive touchscreen and from what we've seen it seems responsive enough.\nThe widescreen aspect means that you don't get all the landscape space you might have wanted to reduce scrolling on websites, but it is sharp and the colours from sample images were certainly vivid, allowing of course for the fact that these were put in the device to do just that - show the screen at its best.\nOn the connectivity front you get UMTS/HSDPA (tri-band), GSM, EDGE (quad-band) as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It connects to the charger and your PC via a microUSB jack. A 3.5mm headphone jack sits on the top.\nAround the back is a 5-megapixel camera, but no sign of a flash or a LED illuminator.

As a small business owner any tool that allows you to save time is a benefit to you and your company. But there are limitations to online banking that you should consider before you decide to rely on it completely.\nOnline banking is a platform that allows business and individual account holders to access bank account information via the web. The user must log in with a username and pass code established by the bank to pull up database information regarding his account.\nWhen you bank online you can perform a number of services, including account balance checks, transfers and bill payment. The written format of the account information makes it simpler for some account holders to keep track of transactions. The user can process a transfer from one account to another without having to visit the branch. With online bill payment services, you can process electronic checks to suppliers and vendors.\nThe Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978 governs online banking services. This is because the process of maintaining an online account involves bill payments and funds transfers. The law protects customers who choose to bank in this manner.\nYou have a number of concerns to address as a business owner when it comes to online banking. For one, there's a risk of identify theft that would compromise your hard-earned business revenues. Phishing emails asking customers to log into fake bank websites are a common way for information thieves to get sensitive log-in data to access a bank account illegally. Also, there's a learning curve for getting familiar with online banking. The system can be confusing for first-time users\u2014especially if you're not computer literate. Finally, if your Internet service or the bank's server goes down, you cannot access your account information online. This is difficult to manage if you've gotten into the habit of regularly managing your business bank account information in this manner. If you've linked the online account to a third-party business financial software program, you'll have to wait until the server or Internet service goes back up to get updates.\nThankfully, you can resolve some of these issues with due diligence and common sense. For instance, to avoid phishing websites, it's best to always type in the URL address instead of clicking links leading you to your bank's website. Also, it's important to look for an online banking tutorial when you first log into your account to avoid confusion regarding the service down the line. While an Internet or server issue is usually out of your control, prepare yourself for this problem by getting familiar with your bank's phone system or just visit the branch for updates and statement printouts regarding your account.\nBalle, Louise. \"Limitations to Online Banking.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/limitations-online-banking-3447.html.

Jackie and Frances are both confident small business owners, but the thought that he may be diving deeper into a situation similar to his marriage, spurred on by Jackie wanting to enter into a legal business partnership with him, is enough to make Robert momentarily skittish about his relationship.\nFrances is in a similar parallel: She starts the episode by lying to Andrew about the real reason her marriage failed (her infidelity).

Moisturize the affected area to stop it from drying out. This can prevent more hangnails from developing.\nMedicinal creams. Applying small amounts of antibiotic or antifungal cream, depending on the cause of the infection, can speed up recovery. A doctor may also recommend topical steroids.\nIf the hangnail develops an abscess or starts producing pus, it may need to be drained to stop the infection from spreading. This procedure should be done by a medical professional.\nLift the nail fold with an instrument to allow the pus to drain away. A surgical incision is rarely necessary.\nPlace a gauze strip into the abscess. This stays in the wound for 24-48 hours to help the area drain.\nThe dressing and gauze should be removed within a couple of days. A person should then soak their nail in warm water up to 4 times a day.\nPeople can also use the RICE method to reduce pain and swelling. The acronym RICE stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Taking over-the-counter painkillers and anti-inflammatories can also help.\nA hangnail infection may resolve by itself, although an infection that lasts over 6 weeks will need to be assessed by a doctor.\nIn most cases, infected hangnails are temporary, mild, and can be treated at home.\nIf the hangnail develops an abscess or starts producing pus, it may need to be drained by a doctor. Avoid doing this at home, as improper drainage can lead to further complications.\nA medical professional can usually diagnose an infected hangnail by sight. They may also send a sample off to a laboratory to determine the type of infection.\nAn infection lasting for longer than 6 weeks may be a chronic condition. A doctor can advise on the best course of treatment for this condition.\nRarely, the infection can spread to the hand or foot. This can be very serious, resulting in a loss of sensation or mobility, and can put the extremity at risk of amputation. Infections are more likely to spread in people with diabetes or other circulation disorders.\nHangnails occur when the skin around the nail becomes irritated or damaged. Infection occurs when bacteria or fungus get into the wound.\nA person is more likely to develop an infection if their hands or feet are frequently in moist conditions. For example, people who work as bakers and dishwashers are more likely to experience this condition.\nIn"}

From the WannaCry attack to the astonishing rise of Bitcoin\u2019s value, via the sanctity of encrypted messaging apps and the rapid approach of self-driving cars, such is the pace of change that peace of mind is increasingly hard to come by.\nThe concern is chiefly down to the fact that we all rely on technology few of us truly understand, and even that is evolving rapidly. The concern is widespread, whether it is over the minute detail of running of our social, mobile, personal lives \u2013 and the swathes of data we create and share in the process \u2013 or the management of the world\u2019s colossal financial hubs.\nPhil Lander, head of B2B at Samsung Europe, agrees that the turmoil is extraordinary and has seen first-hand its effect on businesses trying to keep up. \u201cWe\u2019re in a really exciting era: the age of digital Darwinism,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is so much transformative technology available to customers today, from artificial intelligence and augmented reality to the internet of things and mobility.\nSamsung works extensively with governments, police forces and the finance sector to address the digital challenges huge organisations face, but Mr Lander says that many of the lessons true here are equally valuable to smaller enterprises.\nMobility remains a key concern, he says. \u201cOur recent survey of managers in large organisations saw 64pc of them say they expect to be able to reach their colleagues and their teams outside business working hours.\nThis spirit of collaboration is a driving force for businesses prioritising their overall digitisation and their ability to innovate, says Mr Lander. \u201cIn a recent study, we\u2019ve seen that 50pc of the largest organisations in Europe are already working with startups to accelerate innovation in their business, and this is a trend that will continue.\nAs a result, CIOs will become increasingly influential decision makers, with oversight of their entire organisation\u2019s operations \u2013 a reflection of technology\u2019s central role itself."}

{"idx": "28537", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: It doesn't mean Obama is going to lose, but the failed attempt to recall Scott Walker gives Democrats and organized labor reason to fear an emboldened conservative agenda.\nIt's important to remember, as Democrats cope with their failure to topple Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in Tuesday's recall, that this was a fight they chose.\nUnlike the vast majority of elections, which occur on a regular schedule, the recall was a fight the left picked on purpose. They picked it because they thought they could win. And they were wrong.\nIt wasn't even close. In the final tally, Walker led his Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, by 53 percent to 46 percent.\nThe idea behind the recall effort was to send a message: a warning to conservatives across the country that there was a line not to be crossed when it came to messing with the hard-earned gains of public worker unions. By losing, however, the consortium of unions, progressives and Democrats that worked so ardently to send Walker packing may have sent the opposite message. If Walker can survive, what's to stop any other right-leaning governor from pushing the envelope?\n\"This really is a test case. The far right made Wisconsin its petri dish,\" said Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action Wisconsin, a grassroots progressive group that supported the recall effort. Walker's win, he said, will embolden the Koch brothers and other national conservative funders to get ideologically sympathetic Republicans to push their agenda across the country.\n\"Wisconsin will not be the high water mark of the attack on unions, public employees, and the middle class,\" Kraig said. \"You will see more Walker-like politicians elected in other states, and you will see more current governors taking this type of attack.\"\nWhen I interviewed Walker a couple of months ago, that was his prediction, too, though he naturally didn't put it in quite those terms. If he prevailed in the recall, he told me, \"It suggests to other elected officials that you can tackle tough issues, you can face the wrath of organized special interests like the public employee unions, and ultimately prevail,\" he said. \"They're not going to be able to bully and intimidate people who are trying to act in the best interest of the taxpayers.\"\nIt's not only Republican governors, Walker noted, who are pushing to reform the pension, benefit and pay privileges enjoyed by public workers. He pointed to the efforts of Deval Patrick in Massachusetts, Lincoln Chafee (a liberal independent) in Rhode Island, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jerry Brown in California, all of whom have approached the issue of public sector pension reform, if in less inflammatory manner.\nThe results for the labor movement, of which the public sector is now the backbone, could be dire. Already, there are signs Walker has succeeded in crippling Wisconsin's unions, whose membership has sharply declined since his reforms made it easier for workers to opt out and harder for the groups to gain recognition. In just over a year, the union representing state workers has seen its membership drop by two-thirds, while the American Federation of Teachers has lost more than a third of the 17,000 members it formerly claimed in Wisconsin, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nDoes Walker's win mean President Obama is going to lose? Certainly not. Exit polls from Tuesday's vote showed the same electorate that retained Walker would have voted for Obama over Mitt Romney by a wide margin, 51 percent to 44 percent.

With Saturn rising at 2:30 a.m. local time, the pair will be best viewed before 7 a.m. local time.\nIf you have a telescope, you might want to consider setting your alarm on Monday (March 20) for around 5 a.m. local daylight time (4 a.m. standard time if you live in Hawaii, Arizona or Puerto Rico, which do not observe daylight time). If you step outside at that hour and look southeast, you'll see what are probably the two most popular celestial objects to look at through a telescope: Earth's moon and the planet Saturn.\nOn Monday, which is the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, the moon will be just hours away from officially arriving at its last quarter (or half-moon) phase. And hovering about 2 and a half degrees below the moon will be Saturn, the \"Lord of the Rings.\"\nOver the years, people have told me that they own a telescope but have never viewed Saturn through it. The reason? Most beginners in astronomy have trouble making a positive identification of the planet.\nIndeed, to the unaided eye, there is nothing outstanding about Saturn. Venus and Jupiter can be identified by their great brilliance, and Mars has a distinctive fiery orange color. Saturn is indeed bright, but it does not seem to \"stand out\" against the star background. So what you'd really like to have is some sort of benchmark to know positively where it is.\nThat benchmark on Monday morning will be the moon.\nAnd don't forget to check out the moon, too!\nMany people may say that the best time to look at our nearest neighbor is when it's at full phase, but that's probably the worst time to look at it! When the moon is full, it tends to be overly bright, as well as flat and one-dimensional in appearance. In contrast, the several-day interval when the moon is around first- or last-quarter phase is when we get the best views of the lunar landscape right along the sunrise-sunset line, or terminator.\nSome people may question why we call the moon at this particular phase a \"quarter moon,\" considering it is plainly obvious that what we see in the sky is a half-illuminated moon.\nThe \"quarter\" in \"quarter moon\" refers not to what we see in the sky, but rather to the fact that the moon is beginning its final quarter in its 29.53-day cycle, known as a synodic month. The word \"synodic\" is derived from the ancient Greek word \"sunodos,\" which means \"meeting.\" During the new-moon phase, the moon \"meets\" the sun, and thus a synodic month begins at new moon \u2014 and the moon is entering the last quarter of that month at last-quarter phase.\nIf you do get outside with your telescope in the predawn hours Monday, I bet you'll be so fascinated by what you see that you'll stay outside almost until sunrise. And incidentally, the direct rays of the sun will cross the equator heading north at 6:29 a.m. EDT (1029 GMT), marking the vernal equinox, the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere.\nWhat a great way to kick off"}

It sees the president-elect a canny politician willing to tell everyone just what they want to hear to achieve his goals. What follows is the full piece from 1994.\nDr. Hassan Rohani is a very canny, clever man. Otherwise it's impossible to comprehend how he got where he did without being a cleric. He's the general secretary of the Higher Committee for Iran's National Security, and deputy Head of Parliament. He is among the very few whose standing actually improved since Ayatollah Khomeini seized power in 1979.\nVery few outside Iran know anything about him. He is careful to remain behind the scenes, and shuns the press as if it were a disease. Yet when Iran President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani needs someone to carry out a sensitive diplomatic mission or fix an urgent security issue, Rohani is his man.\nOf late Rohani has been in charge of the revival of the \"strategic partnership\" with Syria, which has deteriorated because of Hafez Assad's rift with Hezbollah. Syria, engaged in a concerted effort to see its name taken off Washington's blacklist of states that support terror, is going tough on the operatives of Hezbollah, Iran's key ally, at Lebanon's Beqaa Valley.\nIran, worried about the firmness of its hold over Lebanon, came to Hezbollah's assistance and sent Rohani on a mission to Damascus. He met with Assad and delivered to him personal communications from the Iranian leadership, including an invitation to visit Tehran.\nAt that time he also met with top Hezbollah officials and Palestinian resistance groups, to cheer their spirits. He promised them Iran would not desert them and keep giving them assistance and funding so they accelerate their terrorist warfare against Israel.\nAt first glance there's nothing out of the ordinary here. Yet the report about the visit of the Iranian envoy, a report that grabbed headlines in Syrian and Lebanese press about a month ago, reminded me of a tiny tape which I had the opportunity to listen to and transcribe.\nThe soloist is none other than Rohani himself, yet he's singing a totally different tune: \"The Ayatollahs and the Revolutionary Guards sent about $3 million to Lebanon, while we in Iran barely have money for the most urgent sustenance and security needs. They gathered all the Lebanese mullahs and promised them to turn Lebanon into an Islamic republic. What nonsense! I tried to put an end to this but failed.\"\nThese words of sacrilege were uttered by Rohani about eight years ago, on August 30, 1986, in a meeting between him and the late Amiram Nir, who then was the counterterrorism advisor to the Israeli prime minister.

Electrodes in the inner ear bypass the damaged area and create a nerve impulse which stimulates the auditory cortex of the brain.\nAn external microphone receives sound signals which are converted into electrical signals by a small speech processor and fed through the transmitter coil to the implanted receiver.\nAll 100 of the children followed in the study at Nottingham gained substantial hearing benefit from the bionic ear. Children who were born profoundly deaf benefit as much, and often more, than children who lost their hearing early in life, according to the doctors.\nDr O'Donoghue stressed that it was important that deaf children received the implant as early as possible because the auditory part of the brain had to be stimulated or it would lose its function. \"It's a use-it-or-lose-it system,\" he said.\nThe study showed that the children who received the bionic ear were more likely to go to mainstream schools instead of schools for the deaf.\nParents reported the biggest change in their children's communication skills and spoken language one year after they received the implant.\n\"For me it's been an absolute miracle,\" Lord Ashley told the news conference. The 74-year-old member of Britain's House of Lords was left deaf after an operation 28 years ago. Before receiving the implant he couldn't hear any sounds.\n\"It isn't perfect by any means - voices are a bit distorted and birds sound husky, as if they have laryngitis, but who cares? At least I can hear birds,\" he said.\nDr O'Donoghue said that the treatment, which costs \u00a318,000 for the implant and surgery, would not benefit all deaf people. Adults who had never heard were not suitable candidates."}

It has been updated.\nEarlier this month, few outside of Venezuela knew of Juan Guaid\u00f3. But the 35-year-old industrial engineer has suddenly emerged as a cause celebre, heralded by global leaders for his challenge to the near-total President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nFollowing May elections internationally derided as a fraudulent power grab, Maduro was sworn in for a new six-year term on Jan. 10. One day later, Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly \u2014 took a step Venezuelan critics had long considered too dangerous: invoking articles in the constitution that allow the head of the assembly to assume national leadership if a \u201cusurper\u201d takes office.\nOn Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans poured into the streets in planned protests to demand Maduro\u2019s ouster. That day, Guaid\u00f3 took the ultimate step and declared himself \u201cpresident in charge\u201d and the legitimate leader of the country. The Trump Administration and a host of other governments immediately recognized him as such.\n\u201cWe will stay on the street until Venezuela is liberated!\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told a crowd in Caracas that day.\nMaduro is not going quietly, if at all. He has reasserted his claim to the presidency and ordered the expulsion of U.S. diplomatic personnel \u2014 a directive the Trump administration has refused to comply with fully. He also garnered public support from long-time allies Russia and China, among others. But in a socialist country buckling under the weight of corruption, mismanagement and hyperinflation that has left food and medicine scarce, the relatively unknown, inexperienced Guaid\u00f3 has energized the moribund opposition.\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s Twitter bio describes him simply as a \u201cpublic servant\u201d who is \u201cin love with Venezuela.\u201d He has held one public post when he was elected legislator for the state of Vargas, in 2015. Before that, he was part of a student movement that protested then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2007.\nThe son of a commercial pilot and teacher, Guaid\u00f3 grew up in a middle-class family, one of eight children. His mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, founded the Popular Will party in 2009 and led a wave of protests in 2014 before being jailed. He is still under house arrest.\nGuaid\u00f3 inherited the top post at the Popular Will party, partly because most of its leadership has been jailed or fled the country. On Jan. 5, he was named the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which maintains broad recognition internationally despite having been stripped of its powers by Maduro in 2017.\nOn Jan. 13, Guaid\u00f3 was on his way to a rally just outside Caracas when he was intercepted by the intelligence police, forced into a van and detained for about 45 minutes. He was released unharmed, but his detention showed how dangerous his bid to oust Maduro had become. It also showed how quickly he had captured the public\u2019s imagination: In just one day, he tripled his Twitter followers \u2014 from 100,000 to 334,000.\nHis detention followed arguably the most radical step the country\u2019s opposition had taken since Maduro rose to power in 2013, succeeding the leftist firebrand Ch\u00e1vez, who died of cancer that year.

The parting of ways comes as real estate as a sector has outperformed the S&P 500 with S&P's REIT industry index up 24 percent annually since the bull market began in 2009, versus 18 percent for the benchmark.\nThe new classification will include all real estate investment trusts (REITs) with the exception of mortgage REITs, which will remain classified under financials.\nBeing a standalone category is a double-edged sword. The new classification will attract passive investors looking to track a new major sector of the market and may bring in new money from active investors who may not have been aware of the sector's strong performance. But memories of the real estate crash and the mortgage crisis in 2008 may be enough to deter some investors, rightly or wrongly, who still see real estate as risky.\n\"Reclassifying REITs and real estate operating companies (REOCs) into a standalone sector, apart from providing a more accurate description of the companies themselves, will likely raise the profile of real estate fundamentals overall,\" said Jamie Anderson, managing partner of Tierra Funds, which offers the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF.\nREITs have outperformed the broader markets because they are a strong dividend play in a low-yield environment. REITs are required to pay at least 90 percent taxable income annually in the form of shareholder dividends; real estate stocks today provide 7 percent earnings growth and 3-plus percent dividend yield. In addition, the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market, especially the industrial, apartment and office sectors, have seen a strong recovery since the recession. Their classification under financials may not have highlighted that strength.\nTechnically, what is happening is that real estate will be its own category in something called the Global Industry Classification Standard structure, a guidepost of sorts for the global financial community. This marks the first time a new sector has been created under the GICS structure since it began in 1999.\n\"This is the first significant structural change to GICS sectors since its inception and reflects the position of real estate as a distinct asset class and a foundational building block of a modern portfolio, rather than an alternative,\" said Remy Briand, managing director and global head of research at MSCI. \"GICS was developed as a means of standardization that would keep up with the evolving investment landscape.\"\nThe change was first announced last spring. \"The creation of an eleventh sector recognizes the growing importance of real estate in the world's equity markets,\" said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in the announcement at the time. \"The decision to add a real estate sector was based on extensive comments from investors and analysts as well as in-depth analysis and discussions between S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI.\"\nOf course, any change of this magnitude creates anxiety. \"Unanticipated consequences are that people that are looking at the current financial index [are seeing] those returns have been enhanced by real estate,\" noted Alexander Goldfarb, managing director and senior REIT analyst at Sandler O'Neill. \"REITs will come out of financials, so the performance of the financial index can lose what had been a strong tailwind.\""}

This doesn't mean the average owner takes this much money home. In fact, some franchisees have claimed losses due to what they describe as the company's \"misleading\" financial information.\nPapa Murphy's is a Vancouver, Washington-based pizza franchise company that started in 1981. With annual revenues of nearly $800 million and more than 1,500 stores (most of them franchises rather than company-owned), the chain has won several industry awards for the quality of its food.\nIt costs around $275,000 to open a Papa Murphy's Take 'N' Bake Pizza store. This doesn't mean you'll need that much in cash, but you'll probably need close to $100,000 and good credit. One possible red flag in the company's franchise policies is that, unlike most other national fast food franchises, Papa Murphy's does not require a franchisee to have previous fast food management experience.\nPapa Murphy's states that net sales in 2017 averaged a little under $600,000 per location, but the range from high to low is wide. The top third of franchises averaged almost $2 million, while the bottom third averaged slightly less than $450,000 \u2013 about a quarter of the net sales of the highest performing stores.\nThis isn't necessarily disastrous (although some franchisees have claimed so), but it's potentially troubling. \"Net sales\" is not at all the same thing as net profits. Against the lower figure of $450,000, to find net profit you need to subtract all food and labor costs, franchise fees and costs, and general expenses as well as the costs associated with servicing the loan taken out to develop the physical plant. In any business, if the net sales drop below a certain point, net profit becomes zero, and in a 2014 lawsuit, 20 franchisees claimed that was the case.\nIn 2014, 20 Papa Murphy's franchisees sued the franchiser for $20 million, alleging \u2013 among other associated charges \u2013 misleading and inaccurate franchising information that lured them into a disastrous investment. In 2016, another suit was filed against the company on similar grounds by another group of franchisees, prompting The Street, a well-known financial newsletter, to advise investors to cash out while they could.\nSeeking Alpha, another widely followed online financial advice journal, was more emphatic, stating that declining sales, increased debt and the continuing drag of the growing number of unresolved franchisee suits made the company a possible candidate for bankruptcy.\nDespite the flurry of bad news that began in 2014 and continues, it's by no means certain that this company is a goner or that you'd be ill-advised to invest either as a franchisee or an equity owner. If you're considering buying an ongoing franchise or joining with partners to do so, the most important questions have to do with that particular franchise's metrics.

For too many Georgetown University seniors, however, the Senior Ball has created a frustrating and unnecessary financial obstacle without providing low-income families with time to prepare.\nTickets to the Senior Ball, which the student-led Senior Class Committee has advertised as an opportunity to celebrate the Class of 2018, cost $100 per attendee. Students often bring their extended families, meaning the total cost per student can reach $1,000.\nWhile the SCC provided some discounted students with demonstrated need, the process of proving need was difficult to navigate and humiliating for students disclosing financial insecurity to their classmates.\nFuture SCCs should create a form to ease the process of requesting financial help purchasing Senior Ball tickets, in addition to fundraising more and spending less on senior week in exchange for the ability to offer discounted tickets to all who need them.\nThe Senior\u2019s Ball\u2019s unaffordability is apparent to those in charge. Nada Eldaief (SFS \u201918), Senior Ball chair, told The Hoya she understands the cost is high.\nEldaief also emphasized the efforts the SCC has taken to make the event accessible to all students. Approximately 25 percent of the class \u2014 those with the most financial need, as determined by the financial need office \u2014 receive one free ticket and one ticket at half-price.\nEven this generosity leaves a broad swath of students without discounted tickets or a means to accommodate for the high price. Thirty-seven percent of Georgetown students receive need-based financial aid, according to US News & World Report.\nIn addition to international students \u2014 who frequently receive less financial aid from Georgetown and are less likely to be qualified to receive the existing free and discounted tickets \u2014 the SCC must provide options for students outside of the allotted 25 percent of students who receive free or discounted tickets, in addition to the students who need discounted tickets to accommodate other family members.\nNext year\u2019s SCC can address the issues of its predecessors by better supporting students in need throughout the process of planning, buying tickets for and enjoying senior events.\nFuture SCCs must communicate the cost of the Senior Ball more clearly. According to Eldaief, seniors were first made aware of the $100 cost in March, giving students little time to plan how to afford tickets for themselves and their families. If the SCC does not have an exact cost to tell seniors at the beginning of the year, it should provide an estimate to help enable families to plan ahead if need be.\nThe current system, in which students who do not qualify for the discounted tickets \u2014 yet still experience financial need \u2014 lacks anonymity.\nStudents must reach out to their peers in the SCC or to the Division of Student Affairs. Then, they are placed on a waitlist and receive whatever free or discounted tickets are made available by discount-receiving students who choose not to attend the event.\nThis process alienates students in need who wish to avoid the embarrassment of bringing their need to their peers or administrators. Next year, the SCC should build the waitlist through a form emailed to all seniors.\nIn the spirit of inclusion, the SCC should also prioritize Senior Ball affordability by cutting other costs throughout the year. Other Senior events, such as Homecoming events or watch parties, can be cut or slimmed to make room for all who desire to attend the Senior Ball.\nTo maintain the preferences of the senior class, next year\u2019s SCC should poll seniors in September to find events that can send"}

{"idx": "28594", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Since the environmental movement took off and people began to express more concern about the chemicals in their air, water, and food, government agencies have taken a chemical-by-chemical approach to estimate contaminants' environmental and public-health risks.\nCongress's approach was often simpler: In 1958, for example, it passed the \"Delaney clause,\" which forbade the presence, even in trace amounts, of pesticides in processed foods. As detection technology improved and scientists and regulators gained experience, it became clear that a more effective and efficient method was needed.\nSo when Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, it set up a commission to study the use of risk assessment and risk management in environmental and public-health programs. The panel began holding hearings in 1994, taking testimony from scientists, academics, environmental groups, congressional staffers, regulators, and mayors. It recently released a draft study, the full text of which can be found on the Internet at www.riskworld.com.\nThe commission's main recommendation is that governments at all levels abandon the fragmented chemical-by-chemical approach in favor of a more \"holistic\" and integrated method. It wants government regulators to consider a variety of chemicals simultaneously, including diverse sources of the same contaminants and the ecological, health, and economic risks they pose. The commission also strongly recommends that \"stakeholders\" - i.e., the public, private companies, advocacy groups, and regulators - be included in all stages of the process: defining the problem in context, analyzing the risks, exploring options, and then making and implementing final decisions.\nThe panel says this can all be accomplished at the administrative level, and that no new law is needed. It does, however, recommend repealing the Delaney clause, an action Congress recently took, replacing the \"zero tolerance\" standard with a ban on any contaminant in food that poses a \"reasonable chance of harm.\" The commission says Congress should refrain from legislating levels of acceptable risk. It is currently touring the country to discuss its draft study and is accepting comments until Aug. 9.\nThe recommendations, if implemented, would lead to improved environmental and public-health regulation at all levels of government. Including the public and interested parties at all levels of the process, instead of only after decisions are made, would ensure that everyone's concerns are taken into account.

And people like myself feel they have it almost every day.\nThe physical senses are often what individuals use to find proof. But these senses don't and can't speak to us of God. We can't touch or see Him. God is knowable through spiritual sense, which we all have-through the discernment of good in our hearts.\nI can't see or feel radio waves, but when I listen to the radio I accept that they exist. Similarly, I know God exists because I feel Him with me every day. Throughout years of learning more about God from the teachings of Christian Science, I have had proof of His guidance and healing power. You can too.\nOne insight into God that enables me to understand more of His nature is from a book by Mary Baker Eddy, who discovered Christian Science. The book defines God as \"The great I am; the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-acting, all-wise, all-loving, and eternal; Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love; all substance; intelligence.\" That is found on page 587 of Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Often I've begun my day by quietly thinking over what it means. I find that as I am open moment by moment to God's guidance, I know what I need to know, and feel loved and comforted. Guided by His intelligence, I have often been led to make decisions that have blessed me and those I'm thinking of.\nWe had a very severe storm one night, and lightning was striking very close to our home over a prolonged period. Heavy rain and winds prompted me to get up and go onto our covered porch to bring hanging baskets and plants under cover. Suddenly, it was as if someone were saying clearly to me, \"This is not a safe place to be.\" I've learned to be obedient to what I perceive as divine direction, and I immediately stopped and went inside. Only moments later, I heard a tremendous lightning bolt strike and simultaneously saw what appeared as a ball of light on the porch. This was immediately followed by a loud popping sound. The lights went out. The next morning I discovered that a rock that had been on the porch had burst into two pieces, and in the center was a core of what appeared to be iron. A physics teacher I spoke with felt that the bolt had been attracted to the rock, and that my retreat had unquestionably saved my life.\nExperiences such as these have proved to be typical examples of God's care. My husband and I have five children, and over and over again we have felt God's love guiding and sustaining us in raising our family.\nThe consistency of divine guidance has shown itself to be more than human intuition. Rather, it is natural, spiritual sense that comes to us-and stays with us-as we cultivate an understanding of God, who is divine Love, governing His creation with His law of good. A spiritual sense of God's goodness and love engenders a closeness, a satisfying intimacy with God, that you can feel. Knowing God is as natural and as necessary for us as the air we breathe.\nDon't let skepticism and disbelief keep you from knowing your God, and from feeling His presence with you.

We were beyond excited and had to rush to make sure we had everything.\n\u201cThis was a shelter call which meant we were a temporary shelter until Chase went to court 48 hours later. He ended up going back to his biological mother after which crushed us.\"\nShe continued: \u201cNot even three days later we received a placement call for a six-week-old named Dylan. So, we went to visit him in hospital where he was detoxing from several substances and we fell in love with him instantly.\n\u201cAs fate would have it, we got a call from the agency saying Chase\u2019s court decision was overturned and he\u2019d be re-entering the care system, so would we like to welcome him back? It was a unanimous yes.\n\u201cWe were slightly overwhelmed to go from zero children to two in seven days.\nMallory and Michael didn\u2019t give up hope on the possibility of carrying their own child, so after trying all the natural remedies they could, they agreed to do IVF.

Because under SGMA, how much water farmers can pump from the ground will be determined by how much farmland they own. In other words, they\u2019ll need more land to grow the same amount of food. For them, recently plunging prices are a good thing.\nBut not if their heart isn\u2019t in it. Farmers worried about the drought and the industry\u2019s long-term prospects may want to let go of their dirt assets. And because of unfortunate timing, they\u2019ll have to do it at prices well below the peak of about 2015.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either a good time to sell or a good time to buy, depending if you\u2019re committed to ag or you\u2019re committed to being fiduciaries to your family\u2019s assets,\u201d Murray said.\nOuch. But if that sounds rough, get a load of the numbers Rabobank put out the other day.\nAfter southern Central Valley farmland prices rose by about 125 percent between 2010 and 2015, they slipped about 7 percent during the two years that followed, Rabobank said. It expects prices to fall another 12 percent by the end of 2019.\nKern County farmland broker and appraiser Michael Ming isn\u2019t much more optimistic, about prices or SGMA.\nHe sees ag real estate holding its value in some parts of the county, notably in the northern part of Kern, but slipping later this year the farther south you go \u2014 a geographic trend Rabobank noticed, too.\nAgain, water becomes the most decisive ingredient: Ming predicts water districts fed by the Kern River will see price changes this year ranging from a gain of 10 percent to a decline of 5 percent. He estimates areas served by water districts but which have only wells will fall in value by between 10 percent and 20 percent in 2018.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be based on your ability to bring water to your property,\u201d he said.\nBut neither is he planning to buy additional land.\nOne problem is that interest rates are rising. Another is that it\u2019s getting harder to get land with reliable (and affordable) access to water.\nSo, for him, it\u2019s neither the right time to buy or the right time to sell.

{"idx": "28607", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There can be no more elegant example of the alienation of the modern workplace than the fact that hundreds of millions of employees across the globe spend their lunch hours pretending to be farmers on the internet. With all the breathtaking and transformative power of the web at their fingertips, armies of workers and young people still choose to spend their online hours growing virtual potatoes on badly animated digital fields.\nOne of the biggest forums for this activity is FarmVille, the online role-playing game made popular through Facebook, whose players tend and trade digital crops and livestock. Almost 100 million people subscribe to the game, which has just announced profits of $500m (\u00a3300m) for 2010. I have an account myself, and have spent many happy hours playing on my virtual farm, although my attempts to grow virtual opium were swiftly curtailed by the virtual CIA.\nThis week, FarmVille's controlling company, Zynga, has begun a major expansion drive, announcing a new deal with Yahoo and marketing its in-game credits in real-world supermarkets. Zynga's stock is predicted to soar, especially after the launch of CityVille, an urban version that runs along the same principles of clunky virtual enterprise. Because of the extraordinary speed with which FarmVille has become popular, it is tempting to regard it as a fad; but this is no isolated phenomenon.\nThe internet now boasts several massively popular farm-themed video games: from Farmerama to Happy Farm, where 23 million people in China and Taiwan daily tend their digital crops. Altogether, since 2008, the number of regular players of farm-themed online games across the world has ballooned to almost 150 million \u2013 2.5% of the entire human race.\nMost video games have obvious escapist themes, allowing players to immerse themselves in fantastical scenarios such as leading dwarf armies or shooting aliens in epic space battles. FarmVille is not really about escaping to a farm \u2013 most of the office workers saving their digital coins to buy virtual tractors would panic were they ever to be presented with an actual pig. Perhaps what the sudden popularity of co-operative farming games shows is that, for many modern workers, the idea of owning a piece of land within a friendly community is now just as inconceivable as pulverising zombie invaders in Resident Evil 4.\nFarming games tap into a powerful collective wish-fulfilment fantasy: the fantasy of running your own life rather than being a peasant in the neo-feudal hierarchy of corporate serfdom. The precarity and anxiety of modern labour conditions have become more acute during the financial crises of the past two years, and this is precisely the timeframe in which the craze for these online games took off.\nThe bitter irony, of course, is that FarmVille itself is a neo-feudal state, where rich virtual landowners exploit the free labour of virtual farmhands to make real profits. For all its evocation of rustic utopia, this and other farm simulations are ruthless markets whose exploitation of human emotion is anything but virtual. Real-world gift cards, now available in real-world supermarkets, can buy FarmVille players in-game advantages such as better \"equipment\" and more \"seeds\", and, as with many games, some independent speculators have made huge profits by trading online assets and even running gaming sweatshops to boost their profits. The launch of CityVille may simply be the logical next step in the online industrial revolution."}

Still, local governments have largely refrained from scrapping their public-access channels.\nFacing a proposed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling that would slash their funding, cities, counties, school districts and nonprofits that manage community media centers are fearing the loss of their cable TV channels.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been challenged through the years, but I can\u2019t really think of a more existential threat to community media than this rule-making,\u201d said Mary Cardona, executive director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Community Media, which promotes publicly based media production.\nIf the FCC adopts the proposed rule, the money that cities receive from cable companies to use the right of way will be capped at 5 percent of the cable operator\u2019s revenue. That could mean a 30 percent cut in public revenue, according to the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors.\nAt the South Washington County Telecommunications Commission (SWCTC) studio, staffers prepared for taping public programming on local news and events.\nWhat\u2019s worse, community media advocates say, is that the value of any channels set aside for public, education and government programming would count against that cap. For cities and towns that direct the fees to the general fund, that would require making a choice between funding the channels or municipal services.\nThough the FCC has set no timetable for when the rule would take effect, Wassenaar said his organization has been advising local media centers to lobby lawmakers as well as look for other revenue sources. For municipalities who operate these centers on their own, options could come down to raising taxes or cutting services, Wassenaar said.\nMinnesota already has examples of that. A dozen cable commissions in the metro area manage community access channels and negotiate franchise agreements on behalf of their member cities. The model works well, said Mark Martinez, administrator at the South Washington County Telecommunications Commission (SWCTC), which serves Woodbury, Cottage Grove and other nearby cities.\nMore than a decade ago, the SWCTC opted to drop public-access programming, choosing to focus instead on government and municipal programming. That\u2019s not uncommon for media centers looking for places to cut, especially in the era of YouTube when people don\u2019t necessarily need a studio to produce a show, Martinez said.\nSince the 2011 state law, Wisconsin has become a state of \u201cmedia centers on a shoestring,\u201d Cardona said. Further cuts could jeopardize government transparency, she added.\nWhile televised city meetings often are streamed online, Cardona said that cutting a cable channel severs an avenue for residents to watch City Hall make decisions.\nTo reach a more diverse audience, community media centers are increasingly posting content online and offering programming through streaming services like Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire.\nBut even as more Americans ditch cable in favor of streaming services, Wassenaar said, cable remains a primary way to deliver information in many areas, particularly to places with older residents."}

WWN officials contend that there hasn\u2019t been any technical issues with the content they provided to FloSports since they entered into an agreement. FloSlam\u2019s job was to promote and broadcast the shows as outlined in their contract according to sources.\nWWN is currently planning a countersuit against FloSports, but sources have declined to comment exactly what the countersuit would entail. According to PWTorch sources, another point of contention that came up recently between FloSports and WWN was that FloSports stopped paying WWN in July. Sources tell PWTorch that WWN officials were hopeful this issue would be resolved and that they were blindsided by the lawsuit that was filed against them.\nOne question going forward is what is going to happen to the WWN library that is still up on FloSlam. PWTorch has learned from sources that WWN plans to have their lawyer send a demand letter to FloSports to take the WWN content down.\nAfter pulling the EVOLVE iPPVs off FloSlam yesterday at the last minute, WWN was able to quickly put EVOLVE 92 up for purchase on WWNLive.com with a $5 discount for existing FloSlam subscribers if they sent in proof of their subscription. Flosports also offered to refund subscribers that wanted to cancel their subscriptions, but multiple users reported on their twitter accounts that they were given a hard time by FloSports customer service. FloSports was simply cancelling annual subscriptions and not offering any prorated rebate according to some subscriber. After several attempts at negotiating with FloSports customer service it appears that most annual subscription customers were able to get a partial refund."}

When workers discovered her elaborate coffin beneath a concrete slab, there were no markings or gravestone to say who she was.\nOver the last year, as the casket rested in a new grave in Colma, a team of scientists, amateur sleuths and history buffs worked tirelessly to solve the central question in this Bay Area mystery: Who was the little girl in the casket?\nThis week, they announced their answer: She was Edith Howard Cook.\nAccording to the Garden of Innocence, an organization that buries abandoned and unidentified children, the girl\u2019s DNA was matched to that of a descendant now living in San Rafael.\nEdith Howard Cook was born in San Francisco on Nov. 28, 1873.\nThe daughter of Horatio Nelson Cook and Edith Scooffy Cook, she died of marasmus \u2014 a form of severe undernourishment \u2014 on Oct. 13, 1876, said Jelmer Eerkens, an archaeologist at UC Davis who analyzed Edith\u2019s hair.\nMarasmus is characterized by a severe deficiency in nutrients, particularly protein, and can be brought on by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections.\nChemical isotopes showed that in Edith\u2019s last months, she essentially wasted away from malnutrition, he said. There was no evidence that doctors tried to use treatments popular at the time, such as morphine, mercury or cocaine.\nThe girl\u2019s DNA revealed that part of her lineage traced back to the British Isles.\nShe was found entombed in an airtight casket that was 37 inches tall. Her curly locks were laced with sprigs of lavender. A rosary and eucalyptus seeds were placed on her chest.\nHow did researchers know where to look?\nFirst, they needed a lead. The casket was more than 140 years old and there was no headstone. The team had to find a map of Odd Fellows Cemetery that would show the layout at the approximate time Edith was buried.\nA scale plan of the cemetery development in 1865 ultimately was found at the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley. Researchers overlaid the cemetery map onto the neighborhood where the casket was found.\nThe results narrowed the girl\u2019s identity to two prime candidates. Thanks to the Internet and a culture of open records that existed from the 17th century to the 1960s, amateur genealogists were able to tap centuries of records of censuses, births, marriages, properties and deaths to trace up and down each candidates\u2019 family tree. The whole effort took three people 3,000 hours, said Elissa Davey, who spearheaded the search for Edith\u2019s identity.\n\u201cI knew this day would come because I knew we wouldn\u2019t give up on her,\u201d Davey said.\nBob Phillips, a 65-year-old retired federal employee from Seattle, said he read about the casket\u2019s discovery online and emailed Eerkens, the UC Davis professor, to volunteer his genealogy skills.\nPhillips traced Edith\u2019s family back to the 1600s and then up to modern times.

The animated film from producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller promises to show audiences the Web-Head as we've never seen him before. Early tracking is in on the movie, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could make between $28 million to $35 million opening weekend.\nAn opening weekend of $28 million to $35 million would likely swing Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse into the top spot at the box office over its opening frame December 14-16. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sony is a little more reserved with its estimates than the top end of the tracking services, and the studio is expecting about $30 million for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse opening weekend.\nThe mid-December frame isn't necessarily known to be the most fertile ground for big openings, but Into the Spider-Verse is still looking at first place. With a few weeks to go and a final marketing push, projections could go higher. And with a huge opening less likely, there is the hope that the PG-rated film can keep bringing in audiences throughout the holiday season once people have already seen the even bigger titles.\nSpeaking of other titles, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not the only film opening over the December 14-16 weekend. Also opening is the Peter Jackson-produced Mortal Engines and Clint Eastwood's The Mule.\nMortal Engines is not looking like it will have the horsepower to catch Spidey at the box office. The post-apocalyptic film, based on the novel by Philip Reeve and from director Christian Rivers, is a big-budget blockbuster with a built-in audience, but is only tracking to open in the range of $12 million to $18 million.\nThe Mule is tracking to open with around $12 million to $15 million. The film stars director Clint Eastwood as a down on his luck old man who winds up becoming a drug courier for the Sinaloa Cartel. All of these films will probably have to hope for some serious legs and great word of mouth as they face an onslaught the following week with Mary Poppins Returns, Aquaman and Bumblebee all entering the Christmas fray.\nA first place win and a long and successful run in the weeks after release for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse would be just another feather in the cap for Sony's 2018, as well as open up the possibility for more animated Spidey down the line. Venom delivered for the studio in a massive way and portends a bright future for the studio's shared cinematic universe.

The pursuit was terminated for safety reasons, but Hubbard was arrested in his Sayreville home later that day.\nHubbard's defense attorney, John Goins, asked the judge to consider a conditional release where he could be monitored not only electronically, but to make sure he takes his medication.\nMcGann denied the request and ruled that he stay in jail while his case is pending.\nHubbard's arraignment and detention hearing were postponed in May so a psychiatrist could evaluate him and determine if he's competent to be tried.\nMcGann, who read from the competency report, said Hubbard meets the \"legal benchmark\" to stand trial. He has a \"factual understanding of the legal system\" and demonstrated the ability to make rational judgments, McGann said.\nHubbard \"expressed thoughts in a coherent manner\" and said he wanted to work with his defense counsel to achieve the best legal outcome, McGann said.\nMcGann said he also considered Hubbard's three failures to appear, all more than two years old.

I've lived much of my life in Chicago and somehow never made it to the water park and sunburn capital of the Midwest. I'm not even sure what events or excursions replaced this soggy rite of passage for so many years, but Door County, Union Pier and many Cubs games come to mind. The Dells just never happened. And I never minded a bit.\nBut then beautiful, bright-eyed Evan came along and the Dells beckoned. Yes, there will be Cubs games and Door County and Union Pier in his future, but the pinnacle of a cliched Midwestern summer getaway seemed necessary if Evan is to have a well-balanced childhood. So my wife and I packed the boy in the car \u2014 along with the requisite too much stuff that comes with hauling around a baby \u2014 and headed three hours north to that land of water parks and sunburns. We were determined to embrace one while scrupulously avoiding the other.\nWe arrived on a Friday afternoon with little idea of what to expect. This thing called the Wisconsin Dells \u2014 or simply \"The Dells\" to many \u2014 could have been a slice of idyllic Midwest, where ice cream shops and generations-old bookstores line a main street that's actually called Main Street, rife with towheaded children scampering toward that evening's Little League game.\nFor one thing, other than restaurant staff and hotel workers, I'm not sure I ever saw a local. The town is overrun with tourists. And as for the town Wisconsin Dells (population 2,700, which means the locals were hiding somewhere), its quaintness is buried deep within generations of being a tourist destination.\nConsider the old bank building on the north side of Broadway (the Dells' version of Main Street). It's a compact and handsome gray stone building with detailed symmetry that many modern structures would envy. More than 100 years ago, when it was in fact a bank, it sat attractively unadorned on that downtown Dells corner. In 2016 it's buried beneath cheap, oversized signage that touts the twice-daily Tommy Bartlett water show and tickets to seemingly every nearby attraction. The building houses a bar named \"Nig's,\" which seems to be a relic from another generation, much like the Dells itself.\nThe downtown strip is an array of silly gift shops, good-enough restaurants (stick to meat and potatoes), neon signs and attractions like Krazy Mirror Maze, which is exactly what it sounds like. But people don't visit the Dells for high culture.

{"idx": "28632", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Here's how you can soften the financial blow.\nSometimes layoffs happen to good people. Even in an otherwise healthy economy, you could be a star employee but still manage to fall victim to downsizing. Of course, the worst thing about getting laid off is that it strips you of any control you may have otherwise had over your finances, and in the absence of a crystal ball, it's hard to know how long you'll be out of work. Here are some things you can do immediately to protect your finances when faced with unemployment.\nWhen your employer hands you a separation agreement offering you a certain sum of money upon your departure, you may be inclined to quickly sign on the dotted line. Don't. Consider your initial severance package an opening bid, and try to get your employer to do better. Companies don't offer severance out of the goodness of their collective hearts; they do so to protect their own interests. Often, when you sign a separation agreement (the document that outlines and accompanies a severance payment), there's a whole list of things you're agreeing not to do (namely, suing your company for unlawful termination). Your company wants you to sign that agreement and take that payment, so don't be afraid to squeeze a little more money out of the deal. It'll go a long way in the absence of a paycheck.\nThough the rules of unemployment vary from state to state, if you worked full-time and weren't fired for cause, you should file for unemployment the minute you stop getting paid by your former employer. Keep in mind that some states impose a waiting period for receiving benefits once a claim is filed, so the sooner you act, the sooner those payments will start rolling in. Your ultimate benefit amount will depend on how much you earned, but know that every state has a maximum. New York's, for example, is $420 per week. While your unemployment benefits won't completely compensate for your missing paycheck, they can help you stay afloat as you search for your next opportunity.\nIf you got health insurance through your former company, you'll need to figure out how to obtain coverage now that you're no longer employed. Companies with 20 employees or more are required to offer COBRA coverage, which allows workers to retain their health benefits once their employment ends. But don't celebrate just yet, because taking advantage of COBRA generally means paying 100% of your premium for as long as you hold onto your old company's plan. Remember, just because you paid $150 a month for insurance while you were employed doesn't mean that your employer didn't pick up, say, the $350 balance. In many cases, COBRA won't be the lowest-cost insurance option out there. There's a good chance you'll be better off shopping for a new plan on the Obamacare marketplace. But don't delay: If you fail to obtain insurance, you could pay a penalty of $695 per uninsured adult and $347.50 per uninsured child, or a family maximum of $2,085. Plus, if you run into a health issue while uninsured, the resulting bills could be catastrophic.\nIdeally, you should have an emergency fund with enough money to cover at least three months of living expenses. Review that balance against your current budget and then plan carefully for how you're going to spend it. You may need to cut back or eliminate negotiable expenses, like cable TV, new clothing purchases, or your gym membership, until you once again have a steady source of income. Don't have"}

Sometimes at the studio in England he would kind of demo a little idea by himself where he\u2019d play a few different instruments. Sometimes they were a little bit more arranged, but most of the time it was just a sketch of an idea. Sometimes he\u2019d work them out in rehearsal with the band.\nMcCartney plays bass, drums and piano on some tracks. The track Confidante, according to Kurtsin is mostly a Paul piece, \"but then sometimes a studio musician would come in and play a little bit of strings, like a cello would be added or sometimes it would be a cimbalom.\"\nThen maybe half an hour would go by and I\u2019d say, 'Hey, Paul, what about that idea I mentioned a little while ago?\" He said, 'Oh, I heard you. I was just pretending to ignore you.' We\u2019d just laugh about it. \"\nKutsin recalls their discussion of approaches to songs. \"If he challenged me and wasn\u2019t into the idea, I would realize, you know, that this is coming from a Beatle. He\u2019s tried everything at this point. He\u2019s done experimental albums. He\u2019s done pop albums. Anything I could possibly ever want to do in the studio, he\u2019s been there and tried it.\"\nSome of the songs are rock, a number are more acoustic-oriented and apparently a Brazilian-influenced one also got completed.\n\"Sonically, he wanted to avoid anything ordinary, \" says the producer who has also worked with the Foo Fighters. \"He wanted to experiment. Take a song like Hunt or Hunt You Down \u2013 I\u2019m not sure of the exact title he ended up using. He\u2019d say, \"Let\u2019s pull out the guitars. A guitar is too obvious here.

In Crewe and Nantwich it is an issue which is constantly in our sights.\nOne key measure is to prevent under-18s buying drink, and our own officers and Trading Standards Officers are currently working closely on test buys using a young boy as the potential customer.\nOn one day last week they visited five off-licences. The boy was able to buy drink at two of them. On the plus side, staff at two of the other stores carried out the Operation Challenge technique exactly as it is supposed to be used.\nFive years ago this borough became the first area in Cheshire to introduce Operation Challenge. The scheme involves licensees challenging anyone who appears to be under-21 to prove their age.\nBob Greig, the licensing enforcement officer for Crewe Police Division, explains: &apos;The challenge limit is deliberately set higher than the legal drinking age because it is fairly easy for someone who is 17 to look 18 but not so easy for them to appear to be 21. That means people are far less likely to slip through the net.\n&apos;It doesn&apos;t have to be confrontational. In one of these cases the boy was told &apos;if you can come back with proof that you are over 18 I can serve you&apos;. That&apos;s perfect. It avoids any aggravation.\nOperation Challenge is just one way police and partner agencies are reducing the problems caused by drink. We have very effective Pub-watch schemes and work with licensees and Crewe Alexandra to prevent any possible troubles associated with football matches.\nThe Community Safety Partnership have just funded some more dates for the Bar Person Certificate, and Cheshire Police and Trading Standards are organising a seminar for licensees. Any licensee who wants details of that can call Bob Greig on 01270 581962.\nThere is almost nothing more annoying for a busy police officer than to find he is investigating a completely bogus crime.\nBurglaries are a case in point: Officers understand that having your home burgled causes a lot of distress.\nThey treat the investigations with professional care, and the introduction of our Safer Homes system means the links between the officers and the victims are closer than ever.\nBut, just occasionally, they discover the &apos;burglary&apos; has not happened.\nDetective Constable Paul Davis, from the burglary unit at Crewe, explains: &apos;We are only talking about a small number of cases, but every so often we get a claim from someone who is simply trying to twist money out of an insurance company, or a benefits organisation, or is trying to cover up some other crime they have committed.\n&apos;If we find the allegation is false, we will take action and this opens up a whole array of possible charges including fraud, deception, perverting the course of justice and wasting police time. They all carry stiff penalties, including prison.\nIf you wish contact Les Fearn on any of the issues raised phone 01270 500222.

The course was moderately challenging with a total climb of 411ft.\nThe weather on the day was perfect for running \u2013 a clear, sunny day with very little wind and temperatures well over 10 degrees Celsius.\nTony adopted his usual aggressive strategy of starting the race at a fast pace and trying to maintain it throughout.

One particular advantage it has is that it is \"very intuitive and easy to use\"; he drew a contrast with Google's Android, saying that many consumers find it \"extremely complicated.\" In spite of the early stumbles, it doesn't appear that LG will be abandoning Microsoft's platform; LG itself does not want any one platform to become dominant, with Choi saying that \"being dependent on one OS is not beneficial for us.\" According to Choi, this desire is mirrored by network operators, with some saying \"there is too much 'Android' in the portfolio.\"\nThough the third largest manufacturer of cellphones (behind Samsung and Nokia, ahead of Apple and RIM), LG has struggled to make a success of the smartphone market; in 2010 its mobile phone division posted large losses, and last September its CEO resigned. With Samsung appearing to be the clear winner among Windows Phone 7 early adopters\u2014thanks, no doubt, to its striking AMOLED screens and diminuitive size\u2014Choi's comments might be as much a reflection of LG's continued inability to produce truly competitive smartphones as they are a comment on Windows Phone 7's reception in the market.\nChoi suggested that the situation would change once mid- and low-priced handsets became available. Windows Phone 7's specification limits it to relatively high-end hardware, with a price to match. However, given the widespread subsidization of phone handsets\u2014including many free or one cent promotions in the US\u2014it's hard to believe that cutting prices is going to make much difference.

This domestic carnage was the other side of the coin of their policies of conducting endless overseas wars spreading carnage to three continents. The last fifteen years of political leadership spread domestic carnage by allowing the epidemic of drug addiction (mostly related to uncontrolled synthetic opiate prescriptions) to kill hundreds of thousands of mostly young American\u2019s and destroy the lives of millions.

In fact, Trumps has repeatedly stated his intention to increase international trade. What Trump proposes is to increase US world trade from the inside, rather than from overseas. He seeks to re-negotiate the terms of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements to secure greater reciprocity with trading partners. Under Obama, the US was more aggressive in imposing trade tariffs that any other country in the OECD.\nGarbage journalists label Trump as a \u2018protectionist\u2019, confusing his policies to re-industrialize the economy with autarky. Trump will promote exports and imports, retain an open economy, while increasing the role of the US as a producer and exporter.. The US will become more selective in its imports. Trump will favor the growth of manufacturing exporters and increase imports of primary commodities and advanced technology while reducing the import of automobiles, steel and household consumer products.\nIn recent decades, Russia was drastically transformed from a powerful collectivist economy to a capitalist vassal-gangster oligarchy and more recently to a reconstituted mixed economy and strong central state.

He won 79 percent of all the games he coached and he did it with players the bigger schools didn\u2019t want.\nWhen Kresse was pursuing a player, he often recruited the parents and sold Charleston. The idea was that if the family liked visiting the city, they would just love to come all the time to see their child play ball.\nWhen Kresse first arrived on campus, he visited the fraternity houses and infused various other campus organizations with his enthusiasm.

Does he have a point or is it none of his business?\nOf course he's right. They are a nuisance in car parks and the drivers feel so safe and secure in their armour plate, that they very quickly become aggressive and think every one else should give way to them.\nI have a 4x4 and use it for a number of uses as well as taking my kids to school. I think Ken Livingstone should shut up and get on with the job he is being paid to do.\nWell done Ken, I totally agree that unnecessarily large vehicles should carry a punitive level of taxation to reflect the damage they do to the environment in terms of pollution and congestion. Freedom of choice is fine for those with the money to excercise it, but as asthma rates continue to rise in children in London, the time has come to intervene.\nI have to agree with Ken. Although it is everyone's right to spend their money on what they want to, there is something hugely ridiculous about a giant 4 x 4 hurtling along the roads of the cities and suburbs. But worse than that is the arrogance that seems to stem from a 'my car's bigger than your car' attitude.\nI couldn't agree more - my road is crammed full of them. Ken will certainly get my vote now!\nWhat a load of Big Brother-ish garbage! Just about everyone and his dog owns a 4 x 4 (SUV)here in the States, and a lot of our roads through towns are narrow, but there doesn't appear to be any problems. What difference is there in the size of the average 4 x 4 to the larger \"family cars\"?\nJust for once (!) I totally agree with Ken. These huge vehicles take up more than their fair share of road-space, and one might just as well follow a furniture van from the viewing aspect. I have long held the belief that people who drive huge cars should pay more tax.\nThat's crazy! It's none of his business, in my opinion. I"}

Her nomination has already caused infighting in the ZANU-PF ruling party, with some claiming they&apos;ve been intimidated.\nThe ZANU-PF Women&apos;s League said they hope Mrs. Mugabe can advance women&apos;s issues and help heal factionalism because she has \"the president&apos;s ear.\"\nBut, like her husband, Mrs. Mugabe has a knack for giving speeches with fiery and hostile language.\nIn July, during her acceptance speech for the ZANU-PF post, she all but threatened the deputy justice minister and parliament member Fortune Chasi who, she said, has frustrated her efforts to acquire more land and a conservancy near her farm that is an animal sanctuary with gold reserves, where some villagers now live and pan for gold.\n\"I might have a small fist but when it comes to fighting I will put stones inside to enlarge it, or even put on gloves to make it bigger. Do not doubt my capabilities,\" Mrs. Mugabe told thousands of women who were bussed from across the country to her farm in the Mazowe area northwest of Harare.\nMugabe, who has ruled since 1980 and won re-election in a disputed poll in July 2013, has already accepted a proposal by the women&apos;s wing to be the party&apos;s candidate for the 2018 election. He will be 94 by then. Politicians have been jockeying for position to succeed him.\nOnce a secretary in Mugabe&apos;s office, Mrs. Mugabe rose to prominence after news broke that she had a child with Mugabe while his first wife, Sally, lay bedridden due to a kidney ailment. Sally, a Ghanaian, died in 1992 from kidney failure. Mugabe has since said Sally knew and approved of Mrs. Mugabe since they were childless and he wanted children.\nAfter a Catholic wedding in 1996, Mrs. Mugabe made headlines for alleged expensive shopping trips, a fiery temper and the acquisition of huge tracts of land under Mugabe&apos;s controversial land reform program. The couple has three children, and Mrs. Mugabe has another son from an earlier marriage to a retired air force officer.\nShe joined Mugabe on the political campaign trail in 2008 after he lost the first round of voting to opposition leader and main rival Morgan Tsvangirai.

{"idx": "28658", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Turkey-Russia Spat: What Does it Mean in the Long Term?\nTurkey\u2019s spat with Russia is not a spontaneous act. The recent tensions will hurt coalition efforts against the Islamic State (ISIS, Daesh), delaying a diplomatic solution in Syria. By shooting down a Russian military jet, Turkey shows its strong determination to secure the Azaz-Jarablus line along its southern border. Russia, in return, will be forcefully active in northern Syria to punish Turkey, getting more vocal about Turkey\u2019s murky relations with ISIS, and more willing to support the Kurdish YPG expansion into Azaz-Jarablus. As economic ties between Turkey and Russia is strongly symbiotic, how the rift over Syria will influence energy geopolitics is to be watched closely.\nThe opposing narratives of Turkish and Russian authorities only tell part of the truth: Russia conducts provocative operations along Turkey\u2019s borders and Turkey asserts hawkish determination in supporting the Syrian opposition. Skirmishes of warplanes are not rare and certainly not the first time by Russian planes. Russia\u2019s bombing of Turkmen forces appears most frequent in the Turkish media, and yet, not seen a convincing reason even among Turks. Therefore, Turkey\u2019s response needs to be read in a larger picture.\nPutin\u2019s remarks on being \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d give a false impression that Turkey and Russia have been close allies in their fight against ISIS. It is merely a Putinesque way of legitimizing Russia\u2019s role in Syria, if not an utmost illusion.\nRussia\u2019s involvement in the Syrian civil war was a direct threat to Turkey\u2019s interests. Turkey has long proposed a no-fly zone in northern Syria both to facilitate its support to the anti-Assad forces and to stop YPG\u2019s expansion. Russia saved the Assad regime at the most critical time by crushing the Syrian opposition, and thus, got directly at odds with Turkey.\nRussia did not only crackdown on the opposition\u2014which made Turks most frustrated\u2014but also meddled with the Kurds in Syria, seeking cooperation with the YPG, which is considered as a terrorist organization by Turkey due to its ties with Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK).\nTurkey\u2019s hawkish response, thus, is an outcome of long tensions in the region. Turkey has been insisting on establishment of a \u201cno fly zone\u201d by the coalition. For Ankara, such a zone would provide shelter for refugees, prevent Kurdish expansion, and train the Syrian opposition. Although the Turks do not expect their efforts will make a no-fly zone likely, they continue to show their determination in securing the Azaz-Jarablus line to all actors in the region, including the US-backed Kurdish YPG forces. The AKP\u2019s electoral victory in November also gave a strong hand to Erdogan at the G-20 meeting hosted in Turkey. The Turkish government, perhaps wrongly so, believes that NATO would respect the Azaz-Jarablus line as Turkey\u2019s turf.\nBut recent developments also raise questions about the civil-military dynamics in Turkish politics. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu highlighted that it was his own order to apply the rules of engagement (read: not the Turkish military). Only a few days after the crisis, two generals and a retired colonel were arrested on charges of espionage and terrorism for their role in the interception in 2014 of trucks carrying arms to Syria. As Halil Karaveli observes, \u201cMr. Erdogan\u2019s declining fortunes have thus restored the power"}

Muhwezi as a condition for calling the General Assembly to lift the purported strike,\" Prof. Nawangwe notes.\nHe further alleges that the students were being mobilized by Executives of Staff Associations to join them and put pressure on Management to unconditionally reinstate Dr Deus K. Muhwezi. But insists that; \"Management will follow the laid down procedures and the students have shunned these calls.\"\nAccording to Prof. Nawangwe, the institution and Management, on the other hand, maintains, that such an action would set a very bad precedent of impunity.\n\"It would be possible in future for someone to do wrong but just because they can mobilise others, no disciplinary action would be taken. This would greatly undermine disciplinary powers of Management as well as set a wrong future precedence,\" Prof. Nawangwe argues.\nHe adds that unconditional lifting of a suspension is also not provided for in the Human Resources Manual of the University and is thus illegal and unlawful.\nHe also observes that the perpetrators of the stand-off want to create a situation in the University which makes it ungovernable.\nIn his report to the Council, Prof. Nawangwe says all Colleges have since resumed full teaching including College of Engineering, Design Art and Technology - CEDAT, College of Health Sciences - CHS, College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources & Biosecurity - COVAB, College of Education and External Studies - CEES, College of Natural Sciences - CONAS, College of Humanities and"}

Naturally, Springfield managed to find its way into the latter category.\nSpringfield College was ranked the 17th most dangerous campus in the country, based on the Daily Beast's research. The college was one of 6 institutions in Massachusetts to make the Beast's top 25, according to their two primary sources -- local FBI statistics, and stats from the Clery Act, which requires colleges to report crimes that occur on and around their campus to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\"The college had a large number of aggravated assaults in 2006, relative to its size, but the rate has since gone down,\" the Daily Beast wrote of Springfield College. \"Most crimes occurred on campus, not around it.\"\nSpringfield College, whose population is listed at 4,806 according to Clery Act data, reported 13 burglaries in 2005 and 2006 respectively, and 28 in 2007. The College reported twelve aggravated assaults on campus in 2006, which dropped to two in 2007. Seven on-campus robberies were reported in 2006, two in 2007.\nAs we've seen before, some of the research behind best-of / worst-of list-icles is coarse at best, and some commenters took issue with the Daily Beast's methodology. Emerson College was ranked the most dangerous campus in the country. But while crime stats reported around the campus were high, its on-campus crime stats show a pretty safe campus. Researchers didn't include Virginia Tech on the list, saying that the 2007 shooting spree that killed 32 people was an exception on an otherwise safe campus for its size.\n\"2007 statistics show that Amherst College reported more burglaries than Springfield College, American International College, HCC, WNEC, and Springfield Technical Community College combined.\"\nThe Beast's research weighted and scored campuses' crimes differently according to severity. Since the research looked at Clery Act data reported up until 2007, a school's total score was then adjusted according to local 2008 crime statistics (crime in Springfield fell 8% in 2008, according to the Springfield Police Department). That adjusted number was then divided by the student population. They measured colleges with at least 4,000 students, arguing that crime stats could skew the crime rate in smaller colleges unfairly.\n\"Generally, myself and certainly our president feel that [the report] was relatively one-sided and didn\u2019t particularly delve into any of the particulars of the numbers,\" said John Mailhot, Springfield College's Vice President of Administration and Finance. \"It was, in effect, a restatement of raw data.\"\nFurther, Mailhot said, the Daily Beast published that raw data \"without spending any time contacting any of the colleges asking if there were any aberrations that might have led to a spike in that particular year.\"\nMailhot added that of Springfield College's 12 on-campus aggravated assaults in 2006 -- on which the Daily Beast hung their ranking -- some could probably have been classified as simple assault, but the College had attempted report according to Department of Education guidelines as closely as possible.

Mr Lee passed away peacefully at the Singapore General Hospital today at 3.18am. He was 91,\" said the PMO.\nArrangements for the public to pay respects and for the funeral proceedings will be announced later, it added.\nMr Lee, who was born in 1923, formed the People\u2019s Action Party in 1954, then became Prime Minister in 1959. He led the nation through a merger with the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, as well as into Independence in 1965.\nHe leaves behind two sons \u2013 Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Hsien Yang \u2013 and a daughter, Lee Wei Ling.\nFrom early in his life, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had braced himself to face history\u2019s tumultuous tides head-on.\nHis efforts to build a nation were shaped by his early life experiences.\nFor the young Lee Kuan Yew, the Japanese Occupation was the single most important event that shaped his political ideology. The depravation, cruelty and humiliation that the war wreaked on people made it clear to Mr Lee that, to control one\u2019s destiny, one had to first gain power.\nBorn to English-educated parents Lee Chin Koon and Chua Jim Neo, Mr Lee was named \u201cKuan Yew\u201d which means \u201clight and brightness\u201d, but also \u201cbringing great glory to one\u2019s ancestors\u201d. He was given the English moniker \u201cHarry\u201d by his paternal grandfather.\nHe continued the family tradition of being educated in English, and read law at Cambridge University after excelling as a student at Raffles College. His experience of being as a colonial subject when he was in England in the late 1940s fuelled his interest in politics, while also sharpening his anti-colonial sentiments.\nMr Lee\u2019s political life began right after he returned to Singapore in 1950, when he began acting as a legal adviser and negotiator representing postal workers who were fighting for better pay and working conditions.\nHe was soon appointed by many more trade unions, including some which were controlled by pro-communists.\nIn a marriage of convenience to overthrow the British, Mr Lee formed the People\u2019s Action Party in 1954 with these pro-communists and other anti-colonialists.\nA key part of winning power at the time was securing the support of the masses, and this meant reaching out to the Chinese-educated, which made up the majority of the population in Singapore. He had taken eight months of Mandarin classes in 1950, and he renewed his Mandarin education five years later, at the age of 32. And within a short time, he had mastered the language sufficiently to address public audiences.\nIn the mid-1950s, riots broke out that fuelled tensions between the local Government and the communist sympathisers in the Chinese community. A few pro-communist members of the PAP were arrested.\nLeading the PAP, Mr Lee fought for their release and ran a campaign against corruption in the 1959 elections for a Legislative"}

Grant represents a man who was charged with DWI after Odom seized his blood using a warrant signed by Crane.\nCrane denied ever signing a blank warrant. He said he had never heard the allegation until he was approached this week by The Dallas Morning News. He also said he didn't know the video played a role in getting the case dismissed in 2016.\n\"There is no blank warrant,\" he said.\nMesquite Police Chief Charles Cato also denied there was ever any wrongdoing and said a DA's investigation in February proved that.\n\"Today, I personally spoke with Judge Faith Johnson, Dallas County District Attorney and she verified that there is no active investigation, and also confirmed there was no validity to these claims,\" Cato said in a written statement. \"The fact that others are now passing judgment on our integrity is unacceptable.\"\nAn official with the district attorney's office said Wednesday and early Thursday that the investigation remained active, but by late afternoon a spokeswoman issued a statement saying the probe was closed.\n\"Our Public Integrity Unit looked into this earlier this year and spoke with the officer who admitted that he was only repeating a rumor that he heard second or third hand,\" Kimberlee Leach said in an email. \"The PIU investigated and found no evidence that Judge Crane was signing mass blank warrants.\"\nMesquite police Sgt.

Unfortunately, the way the calendar works, it rarely happens. This year is not an exception. The next regular, active duty military pay day is Friday, 31 May 2013. Payday is on Friday because the regularly scheduled payday, 1 June, falls on a Saturday. So, when will YOU actually be paid?\nMany military-oriented banks and credit unions offer early direct deposit of active duty military pay as a benefit to their customers. If your financial institution does not have this policy, and you've not seen a history of depositing earlier, you can expect to be paid on Friday, 31 May 2013.\nCustomers of banks and credit unions that offer direct deposit \"one business day\" early will see their pay in their accounts on Thursday, 30 May 2013.

The violations range from disobedience to harassment, theft, vandalism, tobacco use and, ironically, truancy.\nStudents with disabilities, students living in lower-income homes and minorities are removed from class disproportionately. They are also the students who tend to perform less well on state tests, said Sen. Peggy Lehner, R-Kettering.\nThat isn't a coincidence. Being in school helps students to learn.\nThat's why Lehner and her bipartisan co-sponsors, including North Avondale Sen. Cecil Thomas, want to ban all out-of-school suspensions for students from pre-kindergarten to third grade. The ban would be phased in over four years and have exceptions for students who threaten to harm or actually harm their peers.\nStill, there is no penalty in the current bill for schools that continue to suspend younger students.\nStudents could still be removed for bringing a gun or knife to school, something that's prohibited by federal law. Emergency removals, which are counted separately from out-of-school suspensions, would be limited to one day instead of three days, she added. These occur when a student poses an immediate threat.\nMore cities and states are considering this approach. Texas recently banned suspensions for children in second grade and younger except in extreme circumstances. In 2014, California eliminated \u201cwillful defiance\u201d as a reason to expel or suspend young students.\n\"There is no evidence that exclusion \u2013 either suspension or expulsion \u2013 does anything to improve a child\u2019s behavior or the school climate,\u201d Lehner said.\nLehner said she hopes that giving schools a few years to adjust to the new ban will help teachers and administrators come up with their own solutions. Lawmakers might include as much as $3 million to help. And in-school suspensions would still be allowed.\nLehner pointed to Cincinnati Public Schools as a model. CPS uses a system where students are temporarily reassigned to an alternative school designed for discipline cases instead of going home when they\u2019re suspended or expelled. Experts say that makes a difference.\nCPS also has a policy that prohibits suspension and expulsion through the third grade except in extreme cases where it\u2019s required by law.\n\u201cIt is important to keep them in school, because it is the right thing to do,\" CPS superintendent Laura Mitchell said.\nThat doesn't mean there isn't still work to do. Western Hills University High School issued 743 suspensions and expulsions in the 2015-16 school year to students of any age, a rate of 71 per 100 students, according to an Enquirer investigation. That's more than six times the district average, which is just shy of 11 per 100.\nReporter Hannah Sparling contributed to this article."}

A lot would have to change before that's true.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Trump is making one thing clear about his plan to cut taxes: It won't be a windfall for the richest Americans, including him.\n\"It's not good for me, believe me,\" Trump said in a speech unveiling the tax reform blueprint on Wednesday.\n\"We're targeting relief to working families,\" Trump said in Indianapolis. \"We will make sure benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners.\"\nA lot would have to change before that's true.\nTrump's initial plan \u2013 backed by Republican leadership on Capitol Hill \u2013 would eliminate the individual Alternative Minimum Tax and estate taxes. It would also tax so-called \"pass through\" businesses at 25%.\nBoth of these changes could greatly benefit Trump and his family's business empire.\nTrump chose to maintain ownership of his businesses while president, an arrangement that government watchdogs have criticized due to the potential for conflicts of interest.\nThe Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, prevents people from avoiding tax entirely through deductions and credits \u2013 and is overwhelmingly paid by the rich. Previous analyses found repealing the AMT would have saved Trump $31 million in 2005, the year for which a partial Trump tax return is available.\nTrump's initial plan also would tax so-called \"pass through\" businesses at 25%, instead of the income tax rate their owners would pay. Most U.S. businesses are taxed under their owners' individual income tax rate instead of the corporate rate. According to Vox, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the Trump Organization is considered \"pass through\" as it revolves around real estate and branding deals, though it's unclear whether Trump's businesses would fall under this rate or not.\nWhat's more, Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax, which is levied on the distribution of property as it passes from deceased persons to their heirs. This could save the Trump family as much as $1.4 billion, assuming a Forbes estimate that Trump is worth $3.5 billion. Currently, Trump's children would inherit $2.1 billion, assuming the top 40% estate tax rate.\nFinally, Trump's plan collapses individual income brackets to three, lowering the top rate from 39.6% to 35%, which critics say would be a significant increase for the wealthiest Americans.\nThe White House pointed to language in the GOP framework that would allow the bill's negotiators to add a surcharge on high-income households to ensure it is \"at least as progressive\" as the current code. It also vows to eliminate \"itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest families.\" Yet it doesn't identify those loopholes, other than a state and local deduction that is also used by many middle-class families living in coastal and blue states.\nIt\u2019s impossible to determine exactly how much Trump would personally benefit since, unlike every U.S. president since Richard Nixon, he has never released his tax returns.\nTrump is making clear he intends to succeed on taxes where his effort to repeal Obamacare failed \u2013 by working with Democrats.\nHis plan is likely to undergo significant changes in Congress if Trump wants to win their approval. For instance, he may be pressed to drop his bid to end the estate tax. Yet eliminating the estate tax has been a longtime"}

Scientists are attempting to model some of the most powerful explosions in the universe by miniaturizing them into lab experiments.\nAn international team of researchers made beams from a special kind of plasma (a gas where the charged particles are separated and not confined to atoms), called an electron-positron plasma. These beams seem to be creating strong, long-lasting magnetic fields. Perhaps these fields could help the researchers understand similar behaviors in much more violent systems, like the gamma ray bursts in deep space.\nIn our experiment, we were able to observe, for the first time, some of the key phenomena that play a major role in the generation of gamma ray bursts, such as the self-generation of magnetic fields that lasted for a long time. These were able to confirm some major theoretical predictions of the strength and distribution of these fields. In short, our experiment independently confirms that the models currently used to understand gamma ray bursts are on the right track.\nThe team used the intense Gemini laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK, with a special setup for studying what\u2019s called an \u201celectron-positron plasma beam,\u201d or EPB. They created this beam by passing an intense laser pulse through a chamber filled with helium, which creates a beam of electrons. These electrons hit a lead target, and out comes the EPB, a plasma that has equal amounts of electrons and positrons, their antimatter partners. If you\u2019ll remember, every charged particle has an antimatter partner that\u2019s (almost) exactly the same except with the opposite charge.\nThe team has done this before. But here, they were able to actually make measurements of that EPB\u2019s behavior, including the long-lasting magnetic field caused by it traveling through a background plasma (one consisting of electrons and charged atoms, or ions, instead of positrons), according to the paper published recently in Physical Review Letters.\nThese phenomena can help explain how those gamma ray bursts form in astrophysical systems like black holes. Sarri explains that black holes create beams of these electron-positron pairs, which make their own magnetic fields, creating gamma ray bursts\u2014similar to what they\u2019ve done in the lab."}

But UFOvni2012 claimed to be able to identify 5-7 arms.\nThe alien hunter insisted that the arms were not vapor or smoke trails from the engine exhaust but real solid appendages much like antennae.\nAlien and UFO hunters have debated why the UFO has repeatedly been seen near the Sun in SOHO images. Some enthusiasts suggest that the alien craft follows a fixed interstellar route that takes it past our Sun regularly. According to UFO hunters who keep a constant watch on SOHO images uploaded regularly to NASA\u2019s Helioviewer website, there is evidence that a major and busy interstellar highway passes through our inner solar system. Our Sun appears to be a popular stopover for interstellar crafts, including cruiseships, battleships, and expeditionary fleets, passing through our solar neighborhood.\nUFO hunters claim that alien crafts are regularly spotted entering the Sun\u2019s orbit to refuel by \u201csucking\u201d energy from the star\u2019s fiery atmosphere, just like automobiles traveling on a highway pull into a gas station to refuel.\nThe Inquisitr reported earlier in March that Streetcap1 claimed to have spotted the same massive UFO \u2014 \u201ca craft with long arms\u201d \u2014 in two SOHO images of the Sun snapped on March 14, 2016. The first image was captured by SOHO\u2019s LASCO C2 camera and the second image a few hours later by SOHO\u2019s LASCO C3.\nStreetcap1 and fellow alien hunters challenged NASA to give an explanation of the mysterious object, arguing that recurrence of the same structure in two images snapped on the same day by different SOHO cameras proved that the object was not due to an accidental flaw in the digital image.\n"}

The retracement was about normal, a little less than 50% to 2640 before the rally continued another hundred points to 2741; until last Thursday where, for all intent and purposes, it should have topped had it not been for some very timely positive news about the trade war released by the administration. This had the effect of pushing it up to 2756 on Friday\u2019s opening, after which it reversed exactly 3 hours later and started a correction down to 2700 before finding support and consolidating until the close. Volatility has not gone away!\nWhat now? 2756 is deemed to be the top of the a-wave of a larger B-wave which should determine the extent of the bear market rally. The current b-wave has only retraced .382 of the rally from 2604 and does not look finished. Therefore, the index should add to its correction by seeing at least a 50% retracement to 2681, and perhaps even lower to 2662 for a .618 target. After this is complete, we can start on the c-wave of the larger B and see where that takes us, although there are some likely parameters already set for the second phaseof this rally in a downtrend. Should they be exceeded, we may have to take another look at the notion that the bull market ended at 2941.\nAfter SPX topped at 2941, the downside momentum of the subsequent selling wave was temporarily arrested by the long term trend line from 2016 and, after a brief rally, the index proceeded to its projected low of ~ 2600(which turned out to be 2604). That move has created a clear a-b-c pattern for the initial corrective phase of the bear market which can be labeled as wave A. We are currently in a bear market rallywhose first rebounding move stopped just below resistance consisting of back-testing the trend line from 1810 and approximating the 200-dma, making this a tough combination to overcome right away. The pull-back from that level has started a near-term correction which found initial support at the 9-dma, and just above the June low -- levels which just happened to coincide with a .382 retracement of the 152-point rally from the 2604 low. (Still think the stock market makes random moves?) On Friday, the index bounced off that support level, but it is not expected to make much more upside progress before continuing its correction and completing the b-wave by retracing .618 to ~2662 (favored)into Wednesday morning after the election results are known.\nThe B wave is expected to be about 208 points (.618 of the 337-point decline) which would give us a target of about 2812 for the top of the B wave. This is the level where we should be expecting the bear market rally to end and its next down-phase to begin. It took four days to get from the 2603 low to the top of the a-wave.

No tax credits. No subsidies. No offsets or deductions for buying higher end insurance. This will be single-payer (yes I know it's a dirty phrase in this country) for chronic physical or mental illness and for any life threatening injury.\"\n\"We would all end up paying more in taxes, but less in insurance and healthcare costs over time.\"\nOf course, Cuban is assuming that every American has health insurance.

If premiums decreased under Cuban's proposed health exchanges, these brokers would either take a huge pay cut or simply push premium prices back up to pad their pocket books.\nSo far, Cuban has failed to clarify how or whether he would require insurance companies to keep premiums low.\nOn March 28, Cuban took President Trump to task on student loan debt on Twitter.\nFor Cuban, there is a lot to worry about given the $1.4 trillion in student loan debt the nation collectively owes. Student loan debt is only second to mortgage debt, and it has led many people to delay purchasing a home, getting married, starting a business, and even saving for retirement. In short, this debt is slowing down the entire U.S. economy.\nThe problem is likely to get worse before it gets better.\nTrump's 2018 budget features cuts to programs like work-study funding, which helps low-income students pay for college. It also included plans to slash funding for the National Institutes of Health, a major funder of university research.\nCuban's solution: force students to stop taking on debt.\nCuban told CNBC back in 2014 that he would fix the student loan bubble by limiting the amount of loans each student can take annually to $10,000.

RT spoke to Aleksandr Bedritsky, the Russian presidential advisor on climate change.\nRT: At the end of 2009, the Russian president signed the climate doctrine. Could you state its main principles?\nAleksandr Bedritsky: True, on December 17 our president signed the climate doctrine, determining the country\u2019s long-term climate policies, so that we could have an adequate response to climate changes. We know that climate changes could affect a number of processes. For example, they can worsen living conditions in different countries or affect food and water supplies in a negative way. So our country needs to assess current trends, possible threats in terms of economy, international security, and come up with an adequate response. Of course our national interests are a priority in this respect. There are several climate zones in our country. And there are specific threats that may not be relevant for other countries. They could potentially damage our economic development, cause certain social issues, have a negative affect on our people\u2019s health.\nAnother important principle is that Russia\u2019s climate policy has to be transparent and clear. These issues affect all people, so every person should understand what our state plans to do in this area and how it will do it.\nThere should be a principle of caution when implementing measures. We should build our economy taking into consideration negative and positive influence of climate change. We also need to understand that it is necessary to take preventive measures. We participate in international projects, which allows us to implement new technologies and realise the strategy of lowering greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect climate. So we need to be cautious and try not to set climate change in motion, but we also need to be careful when reacting to climate change.\nRT: Nevertheless, Russia\u2019s president said that this climate doctrine is a \u201clive\u201d document, meaning it is a work in progress, and changes could be made to it. Is it because some elements of the doctrine are hard to implement?\nAB: The doctrine has a chapter where it says that climate policies may change. Several factors may play a role here \u2013 new research findings, change in the policies of other countries. We made our position known to the international community \u2013 we are ready to work in the framework of a global agreement, under which all countries would agree to take measures to protect the climate, in order to stop global warming by the middle of the 21st century, in order to prevent serious consequences in the future. At the same time we are facing certain difficulties in drafting the global treaty because different countries are not united on a number of issues. The president said that we were ready to work on the global treaty and participate in this process, but if the global treaty was not signed Russia would take the steps internally that it had planned and it had announced. We will take such measures, because they are beneficial to us. These measures are based on the modernisation of the economy. To decrease the impact on climate, first and foremost, we must use fewer resources. And we are pursuing several goals here. You know that resources are not infinite. Oil and gas resources are limited, therefore, the more we save and the less we spend per production item, the better and the more competitive our products are.\nIt means leaving something to future generations, leaving something of these reserves and these resources, as well as shifting to renewable energy \u2013 all these actions, all these plans are beneficial to our country.\nRT: I see.

Nineteen of those is what comes out of one gallon of gas,\" he said. \"It is our future because we can't carry on as we are.\"\nAs for his take on giving drivers more incentives to buy electric, Zeid said he believes there are already plenty.

We don't really want to be rubbing their nose in it with HOV access as well,\" Zeid said.\nHB19-1199 , known as the Colorado Clean Pass Act, would allow electric vehicle owners to use HOV lanes for free and all other express lanes for half price.

There\u2019s a difference between what people believe with all their heart, the truth \u2014 and a straight-up lie. In the case of \u201cfake news,\u201d you have to realize that some people believe these stories with all their heart because either they don\u2019t have all the information, or else the story aligns so closely with what they want to believe that they do believe it. That, to them, is truth.\nOn the far side you have stories that are flat-out fabrications, made up to try and tell a story that has no basis in fact.\nThen there is the truth, which is typically something else. Sometimes it is in the middle of two opposing points of view that are rooted in personal bias. Sometimes it is counter to what you are being told, and sometimes it is a manipulation of what actually happened because someone only had a piece of the story to tell. The scary thing here is that a fact does not always translate to \u201ctruth\u201d because it can vary from one person to the next.\nIn the case of advertising, AT&T used a term to convey a next generation of development incorrectly. I am certain the company did not have malice in mind, but must have believed this was the correct way to use the term, even though it clearly wasn\u2019t. Will there be repercussions for the error? Probably not -- at least not until the company truly has 5G products to roll out, and we wait to see whether consumers trust it.\nThe fact is, most consumers never even noticed this change and wouldn\u2019t realize the difference one way or the other. The impact on AT&T is mostly looking bad in the eyes of the industry itself.\nAre there repercussions for fake news? To some extent, yes.

She had suffered heatstroke due to prolonged power outages in the downtown Saddar area, which is normally exempted from loadshedding by the power supply company K-Electric. Some areas in Karachi city receive round-the clock power because the consumers pay 100 per cent bills to the utility. But during the current hot spell, all the areas faced unannounced loadshedding due to overload on the distribution system.\nThe middle-class Siddiqui\u2019s family, living in an apartment building in Elphinstone Street Saddar, first took her to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), the largest public hospital in the metropolis in a taxi, but the doctors refused to admit her because of unavailability of beds due to heavy rush of heatstroke patients in the hospitals. The frustrated family then tried to move the patient to a private hospital, but this time the ambulances were not available. After hectic efforts and paying exorbitant fare, the family reached a private hospital in a private ambulance.\nAt the private Burhani Hospital, beds were also unavailable. With some efforts, at last, a bed was arranged for the patient, but she could not survive and died within hours.\nThe family went through another crisis as ambulances were already booked to move bodies to a cold-storage. Then there was no space in all the mortuaries in the city. There were long queues at the Edhi\u2019s facility for bathing the bodies. After 24 hours, the family was able to perform the last rituals of their loved one and buried the body in an already saturated graveyard in the city.\nOver 1200 people have lost their lives of heatstroke in Karachi within a week, starting from June 19, 2015. The total number of deaths in other parts of Sindh province might be much more as some areas faced temperature as high as 48 to 50 degree centigrade. But those deaths largely remained unreported.\nThe sufferings of common people in Karachi multiplied when at a peak temperature of 45 degree centigrade on June 20, most parts of the city were without power as the power transmission system was unable to sustain the high load. Even after June 20, the maximum temperature kept hovering around 40 degrees for many more days and power woes continued with people spending their nights walking on rooftops where natural air was also unavailable.\nAlthough the hot spell subsided after restoration of the usual sea breeze in the city from June 26, the hospitals still continue reporting dozens of deaths due to heatstroke.

On June 23, some 311 people lost their lives in Karachi.\nUsually the months of May and June are quite hotter in this part of Pakistan when mercury shoots up in Karachi due to discontinuation of usual Arabian Sea breezes, but the weather this year became quite harsher.

{"idx": "28724", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Technology is rapidly changing to prevent vehicle break-ins, but what techniques are thieves evolving in response? And what can car owners do to guard against these high-tech crimes?\nLife is not like grand theft auto. Criminals cannot simply walk up to a car and drive it off. Equally the days of smashing a window and hot wiring cars are well and truly over. According to crime figures, the amount of cars stolen reached a 50-year all time low in 2015, with 69,547 vehicles being taken in an unauthorised manner. However, thieves know that they only have to find vulnerability in any type of vehicle and they can exploit this endlessly to steal as many of this make and model as possible. And they are getting better all the time at bypassing countermeasures like alarms and immobilisers.\nWhat are these new techniques, how do they work, and more importantly what steps can vehicle owners take to thwart the thieves in their tracks, stopping them from driving off with a stolen car?\nWhat happens when you lose your car keys with the transponder system on them? You call a locksmith and they now make a new key for your vehicle. While technology isn\u2019t available to everyone, you can find information about how to make cloned keys readily on the internet. Thieves, therefore, often target locksmiths to gain access to the systems to duplicate car access tools.\nAdditionally, thieves are using booster signals that could use a signal from your key to fool your car into thinking that the engine has been turned on and authorisation granted for the front doors.\nUnfortunately there are very few counter-measures that can prevent a determined thief from using this hack. Experts say that placing your key fob in the freezer may help to a certain extent, but the only sure-fire way to stop criminals from using boosters is to place them in a faraday cage. This fine wire cage dissipates all electrical signals and stops boosters from working.\nAlthough it sounds like something out of a science fiction film, criminals could actually block the signal travelling from your wireless key fob to your car. This means that when you think you\u2019ve managed to lock your car, and it\u2019s sitting safely on your driveway or in a car park, it could actually be wide open for anyone to jump in and steal.\nThis type of crime is on the rise, with jamming devices now available on the open market for as little as \u00a335, making this an incredibly accessible form of car crime. There have already been crime reports of thieves being reprimanded with these devices in large city centres including Manchester.\nThe motoring industry is advising people to double check their locks before leaving their vehicles, particularly when parked in large public car parks. It may seem like a simple step, but don\u2019t take it for granted that your key fob has worked, even if you hear the familiar noises you associate with the vehicle locking. This one is a good old fashioned case of vigilance beating the potential thieves.\nAnother way of duplicating a car\u2019s entry system is with a scanner box that allows you to capture code and send it through to the locking system, as if it was sent by the key fob unit. Some of the more advanced systems could even be used to start an engine, although this practice has yet to be uncovered by the police. Fortunately, although such devices are in existence, few people have been caught using them.\nThat\u2019s not to say that scanning devices won\u2019t be on the rise in years to come.

It was an amazing run, and if you asked Ed Westfall in 1972 whether he saw the makings of a great team while he was the captain of the expansion Islanders, his answer would have been \"no way!\"\nThe 1972-73 Islanders were downright awful, just like the early 1960s Boston Bruins, the club that signed Westfall as a teenager and brought him up to the NHL. Westfall had been part of two Bruins' Stanley Cup teams, 1970 and 1972, and found himself starting all over at the bottom of the then 16-team NHL in 1972.\n\"I helped set all the negative records in the NHL with the Boston Bruins and then we went on to win two Stanley Cups,\" Westfall said. \"And the Islanders came into being in the backyard of the Rangers and we were the worst team. I broke all of the negative records with the Islanders I set with the Bruins, and that team went on to win four consecutive Stanley Cups. You don\u2019t know how good the good ones are until you had a few bad ones.\"\nThe Islanders won just 12 games in 1972-73, but Westfall still relishes one particular victory that season. The \"hapless\" Islanders went into Boston and beat the Bruins 9-7 on Jan. 18, 1973.\n\"I also remind them all the time, in jest, a little bit tongue in cheek, back then they still had (Bobby) Orr and (Phil) Esposito and all of the great players from the Stanley Cup of '72, they haven\u2019t won a Stanley Cup since and the Islanders have won four,\" said Westfall, who was a long time TV color commentator for the Islanders following his retirement in 1979, the year before the Islanders began the four-year streak.\nThe term \"hapless\" bothered Westfall and the members of that first Islanders team and still does today. The Islanders won 12, lost 60 and tied six other games, finishing with just 30 points.\n\"That is probably why you see all of these wonderful hockey players who have played almost 20 years,\" said Westfall. \"Do you call them hapless because they haven\u2019t won a Stanley Cup in 20 years? It is a test. It\u2019s a test to be a good player at the right time on the right team.\"\nWestfall was a good player, a superb penalty killer with good defensive skills up front.

Silva, 42, is walking out his own career twilight in mixed martial arts, including four defeats in his last six fights.\n\"[Silva] still wants to fight me and I still want to fight him,\" Jones said. \"He has 14 professional boxing matches so the different thing about it is, he has boxing experience. So it's conceivable that he could do it.\n\"Both of us want to fight right now still and the UFC won't let him free to fight. I'm 48, going on 49 in January, and because of how big it is, and how big of an event it is, and I know what it means to him, I'm still willing to fight Anderson Silva tomorrow if he was free to do it.\"\nFor the record, Silva (1-1) has just two pro bouts on his resume, according to boxrec.com. But \"The Spider\" has long called Jones (65-9, 47 KOs) his idol and inspiration as a fighter. Jones reciprocated the love on Friday, calling Silva \"one of my all-time favorites to watch [in UFC].\"\nok Roy Jr this is everything I've wanted for years, long before all this happened, it will be a pleasure to step into the ring with you.

I think we have this right, in fact this is something that both You and I are willing to do. So. Let's make it happen, Mr. Roy.\nWith UFC president Dana White recently announcing that both he and the promotion are set to enter the boxing promotional game, it's fair to wonder whether this \"dream fight,\" which has certainly lost its luster due to the age and decline of both, is still a possibility. One also has to wonder how Silva's failed drug test, his second in two years, might affect matters.\nIn November, Silva posted a lengthy note on Twitter in which he failed to accept responsibility for the failed test and noted that his medical team was working with USADA on finding"}

However, there was one thing that went unexplained during the movie: why he has those tattoos over his body. Visually they may have looked cool, but no one just makes their body a tapestry on a whim. Fortunately, we now know the reason he has them thanks to a deleted scene.\nThis is the history of my life. This here, my soul union with Ovette upon Mount Kilos.\nFrom there, Drax goes into what he\u2019s lost in his life, including the only time he\u2019s ever wept (it\u2019s hard to make out what that was over the loud music). Rocket then asks if he cried when his wife and daughter were killed by Ronan. Drax grows enraged and tells the anthropomorphic raccoon not to speak their names. This kicks off a drunken argument between the two, where Rocket says he\u2019s experienced his own form of family tragedy.\nSo Drax, like many, has used his tattoos to show his life experiences, both good and bad, across his body. While this scene was left out of the final cut, we know that eventually the drunken Drax made the mistake of calling Ronan and his forces to Knowhere to exact revenge, but this backfired, allowing the evil Kree to swipe the Power Stone.\nSince Guardians of the Galaxy explained how Drax lost his family at the hands of Ronan, it\u2019s likely James Gunn and the other editors felt this scene was redundant. Fans already knew that Drax had experienced his fair share of tragedy, and while explaining what the tattoos mean is nice side information, it wasn\u2019t necessary to keep the plot moving forward. At least we can take comfort knowing Drax has entered a new stage of his life with new friends. While he managed to get some justice through Ronan\u2019s death, he now has his sights set on Thanos as the real driving force behind the murder of his family. Also, now that he's traveling across the galaxy with the other Guardians, it\u2019s possible he may get more tattoos to represent his new adventures.\nAudiences will learn more about Drax when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is released on May 5, 2017, but this deleted scene is among the many bonus features included on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection, which is now available on Amazon."}

But after the team's turnaround in the second half of the season, he couldn't be overlooked.\nOn Tuesday, Gilbert became the first Spirit head coach in the franchise's 10-year history to earn the Matt Leyden Trophy as Ontario Hockey League Coach of the Year.\n\"I'm very honored, no two ways about it,\" Gilbert said in a phone interview. \"Coming in for half a season and even being thought of for this award, I just don't have a word (to describe) it. But a lot of people (in the organization) put a lot of work into it, and we got things going in the direction we wanted.\n\"I never think about winning awards. It's just about winning championships.\"\nAfter taking over a team that was 13-17-0-2 on Dec. 14, Gilbert guided Saginaw to a 20-10-1-5 record over the rest of the regular season, giving the Spirit a 33-27-1-7 overall record and the fifth seed in the first round of the OHL's Western Conference playoffs. Saginaw was in ninth place in the conference when Gilbert took over.\nThe Spirit went on to beat Sarnia four games to two in the first round before losing four games to two to top-seeded London in the second round last Saturday.\nSaginaw went from an average of scoring 3.4 goals and allowing 4.3 goals per game before Gilbert's arrival, to scoring 4.1 goals and giving up 3.4 goals per game under his guidance.\nGilbert attributed the improvement in part to a series of trades that the Spirit made in January and the leadership of Brandon Saad, who was named Spirit captain after former captain Ryan O'Connor was traded and was recently named the OHL's Most Sportsmanlike Player.\n\"There were a bunch of things that fell into place to help us move in the right direction,\" Gilbert said.\nThe coach looks forward to next season after seeing several of his younger players get experience in the playoffs this year.\n\"What excites me is the young guys returning, the (players born in 1994 and 1995) who are going to bring that experience back to camp next year,\" he said. \"It would be nice to still be playing (in the playoffs), but it didn't happen, but we came a long way.\"\nGilbert, 50, has a history of winning as a player and as a coach.

In fact, according to the December 2015 data shared by the telecommunications department, the cable had barely reached 37,000 GPs.\nHowever, the low number did cast aspersions about the approach of the government in meeting its NOFN \u2013 renamed as BharatNet in early 2015 by the Narendra Modi government \u2013 intending to provide broadband connectivity to 2,50,000 GPs.\nOne of the reasons for the delay, bureaucrats in the communications and IT ministry say, was the lack of participation from the private sector in bringing their services through the fibre network. So what has kept private sector away from participating in the project that was supposed to be set up with the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)? Detractors say it\u2019s the government\u2019s policy or lack of it that is keeping the private sector away from BharatNet.\n\u201cEnvironment for us to come forward doesn\u2019t exist at this point of time,\u201d says Rajat Mukerji, chief corporate affairs officer, Idea Cellular. \u201cCurrently, there is no process by which we can be involved in NOFN. The government had indicated right from the beginning that the project has to be rolled out by BSNL, so there is no question of private players\u2019 involvement in it,\u201d he adds. While he was candid and open about the issue, majority of the telecom players, including Airtel, Vodafone and Uninor, as well as major internet service providers refused to comment on the matter.\nAn official from Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL), implementing agency of BharatNet, agrees that the government has never involved private players directly for a dialogue. He also mentions that the government is now thinking of inviting them to take up connection from GPs to the homes of villagers.\n\u201cIt is likely that the government will take the bandwidth from BSNL and distribute it among interested ISPs through its own process,\u201d the official says, adding that the foremost target of BBNL is to lay OFC in one lakh GPs by 2016 end and remaining by 2017.\nIn the meanwhile, the telecommunications department (aka DoT) is on the \u201cverge of finalising the policy for BharatNet\u201d that will re-look into role of private players, a department spokesperson says. The new policy will also unveil a guideline for the states that have decided to execute the project through joint venture, a spokesperson from the DoT says. According the spokesperson, overall 16 states have so far shown interest regarding the same.\nThe big question, however, still remains about the role of the private sector players and how the government plans to engage them. The common notion held is that in order to have industry\u2019s support, there has to be some incentive for them; it\u2019s a simple common sense that no private sector will put in investments in anything that doesn\u2019t guarantees reasonable returns to their respective stakeholders.\nComFirst India director Mahesh Uppal sums up the reason when he says that the key reason for the failure of NOFN is the government\u2019s inability to align its incentives with those of the private sector. \u201cThe industry has a lot of expertise, especially management expertise as well as resources, which could have been"}

Right now, your thoughts?\nTARIQ ALI: Well, this is exactly what we knew would happen. They didn\u2019t make any big secret of it. This is, after all, colonization in the age of neo-liberal economics and war and neo-liberal economics go hand-in-hand. (transcriber\u2019s note: he may mean \u201cneo-conservative,\u201d rather than \u201cneo-liberal.\u201d) It\u2019s very interesting, the countries they take now are countries which have essentially had a great deal of state-provision for the poor, whatever their other defects, and whenever they go in, the first thing they do is privatization. The interesting thing, as the professor for Washington pointed out, is that this is a privatization which has been carried out by US-companies. It doesn\u2019t even benefit the locals, even the local merchants, and it\u2019s crazy because the one social layer the occupation might have won over in Iraq are the layer of merchants, who tend to collaborate with occupying regimes. They did so with the British in the twentieth century and they would probably do so with the United States but the big entry of American money and American companies to do virtually everything, because they don\u2019t trust the Iraqis, on any level, it means they\u2019ll be even more isolated but it is a classic process of colonization which is taking place. They\u2019ve taken the country, they\u2019ve occupied it militarily and now their companies are pouring in and, because we live in a world where the state is constantly under attack, these private companies are being expected to do every single thing. What they, of course, underestimated very seriously before they went in and are still doing so is the degree of resistance in that country and the notion that these companies will be able to exist very long \u2013- for every reconstructor that goes, they will need ten people to guard him or her.

{"idx": "28749", "prompt": "Continue the following text: New research shows that the cells responsible for protecting the brain from infection and inflammation are also responsible for repairing the system of defenses that separates the brain from the rest of the body. These findings have significant clinical implications because certain cardiovascular drugs could possibly impede the brain\u2019s ability to repair itself after a stroke or other injury.\nThe brain is essentially an independent and separate ecosystem. It possesses a dedicated system of defenses against infection and recently Nedergaard and her colleagues demonstrated that the brain also maintains its own unique process of removing waste. Movement in and out of the brain is tightly controlled through a complex system of gateways and controls that are collectively referred to as the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\nWhen the BBB is breached the brain becomes vulnerable to infection and injury. It is, therefore, imperative that the openings in the BBB are resealed, and quickly. This most frequently occurs during a stroke, which triggers inflammation that can cause the BBB to break down.\nThe new study, which was published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, reveals that the brain\u2019s immune system, specifically cells called microglia, play a central role in the process of repairing damage to the BBB.\nMicroglia serve as the brain\u2019s \u201cfirst responders\u201d and are present throughout the brain and spinal cord. These cells are constantly monitoring their environment, and can be switched on or activated to perform different functions such as control inflammation, destroy pathogens, clean up the debris from dead or damaged cells, and seal off the site of an injury.\nPerforming experiments in mice, Nedergaard and her colleagues observed that when small holes where made in the BBB, nearby microglia were rapidly mobilized and set about repairing the breach. In most instances, the integrity of the BBB was restored within 10 to 30 minutes.\nThe team identified a receptor called P2RYX12 that was responsible for activating the microglia and directing them to the site of the damage. This finding is significant because the same receptor is also present on platelets and is one of the targets of blood thinning drugs such as Plavix.\nThese drugs are given to individuals at risk of heart attack and stroke and helps prevent platelets from binding together to form blood clots that, when they make their way to the brain, can block the flow of blood and trigger a stroke. However, because these drugs also suppress P2RYX12 receptors in microglia, they could potentially impair the ability of the brain to carry out repairs to the BBB once a stroke occurs.\nNedergaard and her team are currently investigating the impact of P2RYX12-blocking drugs on microglia function in the brain.\n\u201cOur concern is that while certain types of blood thinning drugs may do a great job preventing strokes, they could have the unintended consequence of making them worse or hindering recovery once they occur,\u201d said Nedergaard.\nAdditional co-authors of the study include Nanhong Lou, Takahiro Takano, Yong Pei, Anna Xavier, and Steven Goldman with URMC. The research was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke."}

The location is a grand hotel in the old east of the city and I know I\u2019m in the right place because of a large poster sitting on an easel. It shows the silhouetted image of a xenomorph \u2013 the classic \u201cbig boy\u201d from Scott\u2019s 1979 original Alien \u2013 with drool cascading from its unnerving gnashers. Only one word is written on the poster in block capitals: \u201cLAUF\u201d. Nope, Scott has not decided to make a zany space comedy. The injunction is a scream: \u201cRUN\u201d.\nThis makes me think, and leaves me a little unsure. It\u2019s certainly not hard to make a case that Scott is Britain\u2019s greatest living director. His work is era-defining, stylistically pioneering: Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise and Gladiator are all in the canon. And as he\u2019s got older \u2013 he\u2019ll turn 80 in November \u2013 he\u2019s kept working at a demented pace, rarely letting his standards slip. His last film, The Martian, from 2015, starring Matt Damon as a homesteader on Mars, was actually his most successful: banking $630m worldwide and winning a Golden Globe for best comedy or musical (an exceptional feat, given that it was neither).\nMulling this over, I get the nod that Scott is ready for me. Walking into the suite, I find him rearranging the furniture. \u201cI can\u2019t have those soft chairs,\u201d he explains, his accent a bit Stockton, a bit Hollywood. \u201cThey\u2019re no good for my back.\u201d If, as Alan Parker suggests, you are struggling to place the face, Scott has something of the Bryan Cranston about him. His hair, once rusty red, is gradually turning metallic silver, his moustache holding out longest. He\u2019s 5ft 7in, give or take, and is dressed today in his standard film-set attire: black fleece jacket and sensible shoes.\nAnd, in a way, I\u2019ve got my answer as to why Scott makes his films and then keeps his head down.\nEmpowered female leads have since become a trope in Scott\u2019s work. Sometimes the results have been spectacular (notably Thelma & Louise, which led to the first of his three Oscar nominations for best director) and other times they have been less successful (the 1997 Demi Moore vehicle GI Jane). And it is part of the Alien DNA now, too. Scott returned to the franchise in 2012 after a long hiatus \u2013 Fox, to his annoyance, chose James Cameron to direct the first sequel, Aliens, in 1986. In the prequel Prometheus, Scott cast the Swedish actor Noomi Rapace as the archaeologist Dr Elizabeth Shaw, who, memorably, gives birth to an alien by C-section and survives. In the new film, Alien: Covenant, Ripley\u2019s spiritual heir is Daniels, played by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u2019s Katherine Waterston. She even wears the famous singlet.\nAlthough technology and effects have moved on drastically in the four decades since Alien, Scott\u2019s approach in many ways hasn\u2019t.

Sunlight warms the earth. It delivers about 240 watts of energy per square meter. We also know loss by radiation is proportional to the 4th power of temperature. But this math predicts a cooler earth, by about 60 degrees.\nScientists, noticing the same thing, considered earth\u2019s atmosphere, roughly 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen. Both are transparent to incoming sunlight and outgoing infrared radiation (which we can\u2019t see, but feel as heat). So they couldn\u2019t account for the difference. But other gases\u2014notably carbon dioxide\u2014act differently. Turns out CO2 naturally warms the earth.\nWe burn 7 billion tons of carbon into our atmosphere annually.\nSo. Carbon dioxide molecules absorb outgoing infrared radiation. And change in reflected sunlight amounts changes the world\u2019s energy balance.\nWhat mechanism, then, could explain an earth NOT warming? Be scrupulous\u2014a Nobel Prize is on the line.

{"idx": "28766", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: So far, the LHC has been spending its time ramming protons together, leaving Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) the king of the hill when it comes to smashing larger atomic nuclei. When the nuclei of gold atoms collide within RHIC, their components dissolve into a high-energy state called a quark-gluon plasma (the LHC will eventually smash lead atoms to similar effect). A paper in today's Science describes some of the more exotic items that briefly emerge from the wreckage: the antiparticle equivalent of Deuterium, with strange quarks replacing some of the more familiar ones.\nThe paper itself is a mindbending trip through families of particles that are similar to our familiar protons and neutrons (termed nucleons), but have at least one of their quarks replaced by a heavier, strange version, resulting in what's termed a hyperon (four of these, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, and \u03a9, have been observed). In the brief periods that the quark-gluon plasma exists, particles and antiparticles are equally probable, leading to a large collection of heavy and light nuclei and anti-nuclei. It also leads to some fantastic sentences, like the following: \"Hypernuclei bring a third dimension into play, based on the strangeness quantum number of the nucleus, thus allowing the territory of antinuclei with nonzero strangeness.\"\nThe paper focuses on the hypertritons, atomic nuclei that consist of a proton, a neutron, and a \u039b hyperon. RHIC has now produced around 200 hypertritons/antihypertritons, which survive for a couple hundred picoseconds. That's enough to determine that they are probably being formed in the same way a standard atomic nucleus is, by the condensation of their component nucleons and hyperons. In fact, they were formed in similar numbers to their less-strange equivalents, 3He and its antiparticle equivalent.\nThe authors take that as an indication that, at the energies produced by RHIC, strange quarks are present in equivalent numbers to their more mundane counterparts, meaning that further collisions will provide us some indication of their binding interactions, which may help shape the interior of neutron stars. So, they're gearing up to go for another round of collisions that will produce an order of magnitude more of these (literally) strange nuclei.\nDoes that actually mean anything?\nI love reading about particle physics, even though I understand it at all. That sentence is indeed fantastic.\n\"...survive for a couple hundred picoseconds...\" Although an infinitesimally small block of time, this phrase is nevertheless anything but precise when it says \"a couple hundred picoseconds.\" Seems like these \"mysterious\" particles are actually normal particles in various stages of both decomposition and composition as a result of the collisions. Surprisingly, it doesn't appear that physicists have been able to coin a phrase for either particle creation or dissolution--apart from a conjecture about \"new and mysterious\" particles that last only trillionths of a second before settling down into normative particle properties.\nbut if the earth is only 6000 years old, then what does it all MEAN?\nActually, \"a couple hundred picoseconds\" is relatively precise, at least in relation to orders of magnitude (for example, \"a length of time between a picoosecond and a microsecond\").\nIt's like responding to the question \""}

The minimum percentage will also be increased to 30% within five years of the new set of rules taking effect.\nMineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has held months of talks with companies, unions and mining communities on an update to the regulations after a version published last year by his predecessor, Mosebenzi Zwane, drew furious opposition and legal challenges from the industry.\nThe Mining Charter, introduced in 2004, laid out rules and targets for areas such as black ownership to help to redress economic inequalities stemming from white-minority rule under apartheid. It was also updated in 2010.\nFor new mining rights, the minimum 30% black ownership requirement includes a 5% free-carried interest and 3% financed interest each for workers and mining communities, according to the draft, which was published for public comment before being finalised. The remaining 14% is for black investors.\nThe Minerals Council South Africa, formerly known as the Chamber of Mines, said it will take time to study the document but that it\u2019s against the free-carry provision, which will hurt prospects for new investment in mining and reduce the profitability of future developments.\nNew mining right holders also must pay 1% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to employees and communities. That\u2019s a change from last year\u2019s version, which required companies to pay at least 1% of annual revenue to black shareholders.\nThe recognition of the \u201conce-empowered, always empowered\u201d principal comes after the industry won a court ruling in April that the first two versions of the charter didn\u2019t require producers to top up black-shareholding levels in perpetuity if they previously met the minimum level.\n\u201cThe recognition of continuing consequences shall include historical transactions concluded on units of production, share assets\u201d including all historical black economic empowerment transactions which formed the basis upon which new order mining rights were granted, according to the draft.\nThe council said last year that the charter produced in 2017, drafted by former minister Zwane threatened as many as 100 000 jobs.\nTensions have eased between government and industry since President Cyril Ramaphosa, who appointed Mantashe in February, said he wants to resolve the impasse over the charter and convinced the council to suspend its legal challenge to Zwane\u2019s document.\nOther provisions of the new charter include at least 50% of directors and 50% of top management must be black.

{"idx": "28775", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Cash is a critical resource for small businesses and their owners. An unprofitable company can quickly run out of cash and cease operations. Profitable companies can also run out of cash due to the levels of working capital and reinvestment required. One way to ensure that a company has sufficient cash on hand to pay its bills is to shorten its cash cycle.\nMonitoring the timing and quantities of cash inflows and outflows is the crucial component of cash flow management. Cash inflows result from cash sales to customers, conversion of accounts receivable to cash, loans and borrowing, and asset sales. Cash outflows arise from cash payments for expenses, conversion of accounts payable to cash via bill payments, and principal and interest payments on debt. Companies that have strong cash flow management policies and procedures in place typically have shortened cash cycles.\nA company's cash conversion cycle includes inventory purchases and conversion, accounts receivable conversion and accounts payable conversion. A company incurs expenses when it purchases inventory or receives a bill from a vendor, and it brings in revenue when it sells a product or service. These do not immediately involve cash if a company purchases on credit and extends credit to its customers. The cash cycle extends from the time companies pay their bills and suppliers through the time they receive cash payments for outstanding invoices from their customers. The shorter this cycle, typically the more cash the company consistently brings in.\nBusinesses can shorten a cash cycle by lengthening the amount of time its accounts payable remain outstanding. Specifically, the longer a company can extend its payment terms to pay for inventory, supplies and general expenses, the more it can shorten its cash cycle. If a company does not need to remit cash to pay its bills for 30 or 45 days, it has an extra 30 to 45 days to bring in cash from the sale of inventory or conversion of accounts receivable.\nCompanies can also shorten their cash cycles by turning over their inventory faster. The quicker a company sells its goods, the sooner it takes in cash from cash and credit card sales and begins its accounts receivable aging. Inventory turnover has no impact on the cash cycles of service companies with no inventory.\nAccounts receivable conversion to cash has a significant impact on the cash cycle. Companies can shorten this cycle by requesting upfront payments or deposits and by billing as soon as information comes in from sales. Businesses can also shorten cash cycles by keeping credit terms for customers at 30 or fewer days and actively following up with customers to ensure timely payments."}

If you have an HVAC system, then you can be sure it uses air filters.\nMost homeowners know about these air filters and understand their purpose, but some young people and renters may be oblivious to their existence. For those in the dark about air filters, Kevin Barry has a few educational words.\nAir filters remove dust, pollen, pet dander, bacteria and other contaminants from the air, which makes it healthier for us to breathe. They also protect your HVAC system, elongating its lifespan by 2-3 years on average, and increase its efficiency, which saves you money on your energy bills. The only catch is you need to replace your filters at least every three months.\nBarry and CEO Thad Tarkington co-founded FilterEasy because they know firsthand that it can be a pain to travel to the hardware store and buy filters four times a year. Even worse, it\u2019s a routine maintenance task that most people simply forget to perform, which can have negative impacts on both their health and their HVAC system.\nFilterEasy makes this process as painless as possible using a subscription-based e-commerce platform. As the name implies, it\u2019s very easy. All you do is indicate how many filters you need for your property, their dimensions, the quality of filter you want, and how often you want them delivered (one-month, two-month or three-month intervals). FilterEasy ships your filters, you swap out the old ones for new, and then you forget about it until next time.\nBest of all, FilterEasy has partnered with AAF Flanders, the country\u2019s largest air filter manufacturer, in order to sell their products at the same price consumers would pay at the store. FilterEasy sells filters in 55 sizes and three levels of quality (MERV 8, 10 and 13) at prices ranging from $11.97-$19.97 per filter. Instead of paying a monthly fee, customers are only charged when their filters are shipped.\nFilterEasy has done very well for itself considering Barry and Tarkington initially ran it out of a garage. They dropped out of NC State University to found the company in November 2012 and were accepted into an accelerator program at The Iron Yard in Greenville, SC the following spring. They launched a beta version of their website after completing the program and acquired funding from Iron Yard Ventures (led by Peter Barth), angel investor David Gardner, and Tom Lotrecchiano and Joe Schmidt of Tom & Joe Inc.\nThe redesigned FilterEasy website launched publicly in March 2014, and since then, the team has amassed a total of $4.51 million in three rounds of funding. Their list of investors just keeps growing: TJ Mahoney, RTP Capital Associates, Azure Capital Partners (led by Mike Kwatinetz), IDEA Fund Partners (led by Lister Delgado), Cofounders Capital, Triangle Angel Partners and Fidelis Capital have all put stock in the company.\nAt first, the team marketed their service primarily to homeowners.

Why did that happen, and what were the consequences for middle-class households and communities across the state?\nOhio experienced an estimated net loss of 750,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs between 1969 and 2009.1 Why did that happen, and what were the consequences for middle-class households and communities across the state? Policymakers seeking to build broad-based support for their trade agenda must grapple with this question.\nAccording to OSU\u2019s research, foreign trade accounted for no more than one-third of these manufacturing job losses in Ohio; a far greater number resulted from other factors, notably automation and domestic competition with other states.2 It is vital to understand how these nontrade-related factors impacted Ohio\u2019s manufacturing employment over the last several decades, in order to appreciate why the economic well-being of blue-collar workers in Ohio cannot be advanced though adjustments to trade policy alone.\nThat said, it would be a serious mistake to minimize the impact of the trade-related manufacturing job losses. Everyone who lost a job due to outsourcing, offshoring, or import competition had family, neighbors, and local shops dependent on their businesses. Entire communities were devastated. Several hundred thousand Ohioans were directly or indirectly affected. And for many of them, this was not just about the loss of employment, but also the gradual unraveling of a de facto social contract that once existed between government, business, labor, and communities.\nThis chapter provides an account of how Ohio\u2019s middle-class fortunes became intertwined with manufacturing jobs in the 1950s\u20131960s. It reviews how so many of those jobs were subsequently lost in successive decades, due to both trade- and nontrade-related factors. And it examines the record of TAA programs aimed at easing the pain.\nFor these various reasons, Ohio enjoyed a per capita income exceeding the national average through the 1950s and 1960s. However, Ohio\u2019s per capita income dropped below the national average in 1969 and declined steadily for the next half-century. That drop coincided with the estimated net loss of 750,000 manufacturing jobs from their peak of almost 1.4 million in 1969 (see figures 3 and 4).\nU.S. manufacturing employment nationwide suffered as the United States experienced recessions (in 1970 and from 1973 to 1975) and as unemployment and inflation\u2014stagflation\u2014rose astronomically. The economic challenges of the 1970s and early 1980s stemmed from various domestic factors, which policymakers responded to with major shifts in monetary and fiscal policy.

If the killings stop that means he's either died, gone to jail or moved out of the area,'' said McCann, a behavioral psychologist.\nBut in this case, McCann believes the killer may have been stymied by the death of an accomplice.A search of the FBI database on violent crimes shows there have been no killings in the past 2 1/2 years anywhere in the United States, Canada or Australia that fit the pattern of the Virginia crimes. Interpol also reports no similar crimes in Europe.\nThat indicates to McCann that the killer is not operating elsewhere unless it is in the Third World.\nMcCann said if the killer has died, police probably will never know. ``If that is the case, it was likely a violent death. Violent lives generally end in violent deaths,'' he said.\nIf the killer is in jail, McCann said the pattern of killing probably will resume when the killer is released.\nTwo years ago, McCann and the FBI went public with their belief that the killings of three couples and the disappearance of a fourth in the general vicinity of the historic Colonial Parkway were the work of one person.\nAfter an extensive study of the four crime scenes, McCann compiled a psychological profile of the killer. McCann declines to discuss the specifics of the profile.\n``There is some behavior that tells us something about this man that we just don't want to release,'' he said.\nTwo years ago, McCann said there was a second person who had an ``intimate knowledge'' of the crimes.

But there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty wrapped around both the analysis and the deconstruction of big data.\nMuch of the apprehension behind the use of big data arises from the fact that 80 percent of it is unstructured - think audio, video, and social media.

{"idx": "28795", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Courts in New Zealand and India have granted legal personhood status to three rivers. The strange status is meant to protect the waters from pollution, but the measure could lead to unintended consequences, while undermining efforts to grant personhood status to living beings who actually deserve it.\nEarlier this month, a court in New Zealand declared its third longest river, the Whanganui, a person. Just days later, India took similar actions, ascribing personhood status to two of its biggest and most sacred rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna. Similar to the way corporate personhood works in some countries, these rivers can now conceivably incur debts and own property, but more importantly, it means these rivers can petition courts (with the help of legal guardians, of course) to protect themselves from pollution and misuse.\nThis is undoubtedly a noble cause, but by granting personhood status to something that is so clearly not a bonafide person, the courts have set both New Zealand and India down a path where literally anything could be afforded the same incongruous status. What\u2019s more, the acts diminish what it means to be an actual person\u2014a conscious, self-reflective, and emotional being\u2014while at the same time undermining efforts to endow those who are truly deserving of this special status.\nDeclaring a river a person sounds wacky, but conservationists say the unconventional measure will work to protect critical bodies of water\u2014and conceivably other natural resources\u2014from environmental abuse. The New Zealand decision was not without precedent; three years ago, the country declared Te Urewera, a forested national park, a person. Bolivia and Ecuador have passed legislation granting all nature equal rights to humans, while some jurisdictions in North America are considering similar measures.\nWithin a week, India\u2019s courts came to a similar decision, making reference to the recent court case in New Zealand. The courts assigned \u201clegal parents\u201d to protect and conserve the two rivers. Under the new law, the river\u2019s guardians are not required to prove that polluted waters are harming humans\u2014they only need to show that the water has been contaminated beyond safe levels.\nOnly time will tell if these measures will have the desired protective effect, or if this \u201cnature as persons\u201d idea will gain traction elsewhere. Regardless, there are reasons to be troubled by this.\nFirst of all, rivers aren\u2019t actually persons. At least not in the literal sense. This development is reminiscent of the so-called \u201clegal fiction\u201d involved in corporate personhood, a deliberate hallucination that\u2019s meant to uphold the rights of groups and to smooth business processes.\nLike corporate personhood, the notion that lifeless natural objects are persons could lead to some strange and undesirable outcomes. For example, if some rivers are persons, what\u2019s to prevent all rivers from being declared persons? And if all rivers are persons, how do we start to differentiate one inanimate object from another in this regard? It\u2019s a slippery slope to literally anything being granted personhood status, so long as someone believes it has value. At what point do we stop? Are forests persons, or individual trees? What about rocks? The atmosphere? Robots that lack self-awareness?\nAnother problem is that true legal persons, like you and me, deserve specific sets of freedoms and protections. The needs of rivers and trees are objectively different from the needs of actual people. Rivers are objects and not subjects, although they do need to be kept clean and safe. Issues of bodily autonomy, or the right to vote, are completely irrelevant to a body of water.\n"}

Her subjects are pale and shadowed: guests at a never-ending party for the undead.\nThey wear masks and face-paint: a beak here, but in other works, the rectangular thick red mouths familiar from Native American totem poles. Sometimes the face is obscured by a colourful abstract void.\nIn spite of the mix of cultural references and styles, the paintings conjure their own universe into being. They could be seen as a comment on the status of painting now: declared dead, resurrected, indefatigable."}

{"idx": "28807", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In an apparent attempt to fill the marketing gap left by the demise of Toys R Us, Amazon has released its first ever printed holiday catalog this year. It might seem like a counterintuitive move for the company that revolutionized online retail, but by combining the nostalgia of a print catalog with modern tools, Amazon may have made itself an even more serious threat to physical and online stores alike.\nAmazon is already the place where more shoppers prefer to buy toys. According to a consumer survey by Stifel Financial, toys was one of four major categories where Amazon came out ahead of the brick and mortar retailers Walmart, Target and Costco. That begs the question: if Amazon is already ahead of these retailers, why produce a print catalog at all? Two major retailers known for their holiday catalogs, Toys R Us and Sears, have found themselves in bankruptcy, so what makes Amazon think this is a smart move?\nTake a look at the new catalog and the answer becomes clear. It focuses mostly on toys, but also includes some tech products such as video game systems, cameras, photo printers and bluetooth speakers. There\u2019s even a spread dedicated to gift cards and subscription boxes. Yet the biggest draw isn\u2019t the toys, but how Amazon has integrated technology into an ink and paper experience.\nDigital companies are looking to catalog and direct mail to supplement their existing Pay Per Click (PPC) advertising campaigns. Instead of inviting customers to call an 800 number, send in an order form or visit a brick and mortar store to make a purchase, companies are using catalogs to drive customers to a website.\nLarry Kavanagh is the CEO of NaviStone, a company that builds direct mail campaigns based on online browsing activity. Kavanaugh believes that Amazon has greatly simplified the typical direct mail \u2018call to action\u2019 for shoppers. \u201cAmazon has eliminated the direct response component of the medium, using it purely to drive web traffic,\u201d Kavanagh said.\nSome products in Amazon\u2019s catalog include QR-type codes. Using the Amazon app, shoppers can scan any image in the catalog and go directly to the product listing.\nAnd app usage is a serious strength. During Amazon\u2019s Annual Prime Day sale in July 2018 digital research firm Sense 360 found a 32% drop in brick and mortar store foot traffic among shoppers who had the Amazon app. Contrast that with a 7% drop in foot traffic among those who don\u2019t have the app. The survey did not take into account the effect on other online stores, but it\u2019s safe to say that the Amazon app has a big impact on customer shopping patterns.\nBy tying the app to a physical catalog, Amazon might be able to draw in new users, effectively turning holiday shoppers into Amazon loyal customers.\nAmazon's 2018 Toy Catalog does not list prices for most items.\nThe one thing conspicuously missing from the catalog is prices. There\u2019s good reason for that. Pricing on Amazon changes all the time, whether in response to market forces, to compete with competitor pricing, or changes by brands themselves. Prices printed in a catalog would likely be out of date before they arrived in customer mailboxes.\nHow much it will cost is hard to say. Amazon seems to be hoping that the convenience and stickiness of their app will make up for any concerns about pricing.\nAmazon has kept fairly quiet about how they\u2019re deciding who will receive a catalog but Kavanagh made some educated guesses based on his experience with targeting advertising.\n\u201cI would create a model to estimate how much they would expect an Amazon customer to spend on toys based on their"}

Janice Hahn, D-San Pedro, discusses a proposal to ship Alaskan lake water to California with Port of Los Angeles executives on Monday.\nBlue Lake in Sitka, Alaska, has a lot.\nSo a company that holds the rights to up to 9 billion gallons of the lake\u2019s water is pitching an idea that would send some of it \u2014 via tanker ship \u2014 to the Golden State as it endures the fourth year of severe drought.\nOn Monday, U.S. Rep. Janice Hahn, D-San Pedro \u2014 who was intrigued by the idea when she first saw an article about it last month \u2014 gathered representatives from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and several area water districts to vet the possibilities.\nTerry Trapp, CEO of Alaska Bulk Water, was among those on hand to answer questions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm but there\u2019s also clearly a lot of work,\u201d Trapp said after the meeting.\nBottom line: Don\u2019t stop rationing your water just yet.\nThe congresswoman, who is preparing to run for what will be an open seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors next year, suggested Catalina Island, however, might be an area that could make use of such a plan.\nSitka gets about 100 inches of rain every year and the lake water is continually replenished.\nWhile \u201cnobody said it wasn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Hahn said, shipping water from Alaska to Southern California does pose challenges. The infrastructure \u2014 pipelines and storage facilities, for example \u2014 would have to be built at the ports.\nAnd the water would be expensive, more expensive than the water purchased now from water districts.\nThe lake water, which Hahn described as \u201cprobably purer than any of the water we have,\u201d would strictly be drinking water, not something that could or should be used for irrigation, although Trapp said that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the case.\nMaking the transfer of water economically feasible is the sticking point.\nBut moving forward, Hahn said, the concept of shipping water either by ship or pipeline could become a \u201cpiece of the whole water puzzle,\u201d especially for smaller water districts.\nAmong those attending Monday\u2019s meeting were representatives of the Metropolitan Water District, Central Basin Water District, and West Basin Water District.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos accused the National Enquirer and its publisher David Pecker of extortion and blackmail, stepping up a war of words between the world\u2019s richest man and a confidant of US President Donald Trump.\nThe magazine, owned by American Media Inc., published an expose on Bezos\u2019s relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez, and Bezos has hired investigators to find out if the story was politically motivated. He owns the Washington Post, which has written critical stories about Trump, who counts Pecker as a close ally.\nIn a surprising move on Thursday, Bezos said the National Enquirer threatened to publish more details and revealing photos if the executive didn\u2019t stop the probe. His statement online included vivid descriptions of the images.\nBezos also suggested that the Washington Post\u2019s coverage of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi may have motivated the National Enquirer\u2019s investigation. \u2018For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\u2019 the billionaire wrote.\nA spokesman for AMI didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The magazine investigated Bezos because his wealth and position made him a newsworthy subject, and its reporting isn\u2019t influenced by politics, according to copies of emails allegedly from AMI lawyer Jon Fine that Bezos included in his post on Thursday.\nIn one of those emails, Fine proposed Bezos release a mutually agreed upon statement to a news outlet saying that he had no basis for suggesting AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated. In exchange, the media group would refrain from publishing other texts and photos featuring Bezos, according to the email released by the Amazon CEO.\n\u2018This looks like textbook extortion,\u2019 said Zachary Elsea, a litigator with Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP in Santa Monica, California. The law defines extortion as, among other things, obtaining something of value through fear, and AMI\u2019s very explicit threat to publish the embarrassing pictures unless Bezos complies, fits that description, according to Elsea.\nFine, a former executive at Amazon, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The White House also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThis is the latest clash between Bezos and the president. Trump has repeatedly vilified Amazon\u2019s CEO, threatening his company with tax increases, antitrust prosecution and higher shipping fees, while attacking the Washington Post as a \u201cscam.\u201d In 2015, Bezos offered to blast Trump into space, but has mostly avoided mentioning Trump publicly - until Thursday.\nOn Thursday, Bezos noted that Pecker is cooperating with federal prosecutors who are investigating \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019 payments the Enquirer made ahead of the 2016 presidential election to at least one woman who alleged she had an affair with Trump. The Enquirer secured the rights to the material, assuring the allegations wouldn\u2019t be shared with other media, then never published the story.\nBezos is Amazon\u2019s largest shareholder, with a stake of about 16 percent. An Amazon spokesman has said the CEO and founder remains \u2018focused and engaged in all aspects of Amazon.\u2019 Bezos and company spokespeople haven\u2019t addressed whether he will accelerate his periodic sales of Amazon shares.

{"idx": "28832", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Schools all over the country are trying to figure out how to improve outcomes in the classroom. So, what does that have to do with the weather? When it is too cold or wet outside, many schools cancel outdoor recess. And when kids are cooped up in a classroom all day without the chance to let off some steam, that can affect their ability to learn.\nMost education experts don't spend a lot of time thinking about recess, but it is an invaluable tool that can help schools bring the best out of their students. Studies show that what happens on the playground clearly impacts what happens in the classroom. When students have a healthy recess, they behave better and are more focused in class.\nRecess is especially important for schools that serve low-income students because it offers a way to address their social and emotional development. A recent study conducted in California and published in the Journal of School Health last summer revealed that the emotional well-being of low-income fifth graders had significantly declined over the last eight years. Incidentally, that same study showed that a high quality recess could help reverse that trend.\n\"School-based playtime not only improves the physical health of students, but leads to stronger emotional resiliency,\" explains Dr. Kristine Madsen, the University of California, San Francisco researcher who led the study. \"After physical activity, kids show greater concentration in class.\"\nSchools are often hamstrung in their ability to address whether their students get a good breakfast or have a stable home life or even have a safe place to play outside. But if schools want to succeed in teaching those same students, they must expand their focus beyond simply the academics. They have to find ways to be a positive influence on overall development, including the social, emotional and physical development, of their students. And a safe, healthy and fun recess is one of those easy things that every school should be able provide, rain or shine.\nWhich gets us back to the weather. What are schools to do when winter weather makes an outdoor recess too challenging or even unsafe? Here are five easy tips any school can use.\nAdopt a healthy policy for recess in inclement weather. Each school has its own challenges. Rain may make playgrounds too slick or too muddy. Students may not come to school with adequate gear. Air quality may be an issue, especially for children with asthma. Cold or rainy days can still be great for outdoor play, but students may need to avoid the grass or slick spots on the playground. By being aware of your school's unique challenges and creating a plan, your school can plan for a safe and healthy recess.\nDress for outdoor play. Layers, boots, a hat, mitten, a jacket, even waterproof pants can make winter play more fun. As the old Norwegian saying goes, there's no bad weather, only bad clothing. Send a note home to parents with tips on how students should dress for outdoor recess. (Remind staff to dress for recess too.) Some schools may need a stash of extra jackets, mittens, hats and boots for students who forget. Hold a clothing drive asking parents to bring coats that their kids have outgrown.\nBring active play indoors. By using spaces creatively, students can get the break they need and some physical activity in an auditorium, empty hallway, or even the classroom. Arrange a schedule that allows classes to take turns using larger spaces for active play when recess is indoors.\nIntegrate movement into lessons and transition. Sitting down and being inside all day can be hard for anyone; and it's especially true for kids. Allow students to stand while they work. Or when the class is getting"}

HTC has put out different \u201cspins\u201d of a flagship model before, but this might be the first time it goes with a dual CPU strategy for the exact same model.\nThe smartphone will also launch with Android 6.0.1 out of the box as well as HTC\u2019s own Sense 8 user experience. The latter is something that has yet to seen, as the current public version of Sense is still at 7.\nThere is, of course, no rule that OEMs need to show off their wares at MWC, but it is definitely a once in a year opportunity to take advantage of media attention. Then again, you do run the risk of being overshadowed by bigger brands.\nThere might also be one other reason why HTC doesn\u2019t seem to have something ready even for leaks and rumors at this point in time. The company might be distracted from its smartphones by its Vive virtual reality headset, which is slated to launch in April. It is a big opportunity for HTC as well as a big risk, which may explain (but not excuse) why it\u2019s suddenly not so focused on the smartphone game."}

The challenges, however, may be complicated by the fact that properties relevant to product safety and effectiveness may change as size varies within the nanoscale.\nThe report also says that the emerging and uncertain nature of nanotechnology and the potentially rapid development of applications for FDA-regulated products highlight the need for ensuring transparent, consistent, and predictable regulatory pathways.\nAnticipating the potential for rapid development in the field, the report recommends consideration of agency guidance that would clarify, for example, what information to give FDA about products, and also when the use of nanoscale materials may change the regulatory status of particular products. As with other FDA guidance, draft guidance documents would be made available for public comment prior to being finalized.\nIn addition, the report says the FDA should work to assess data needs to better regulate nanotechnology products, including biological effects and interactions of nanoscale materials.

Wherehouse Music--which signed an exclusive, $40 million deal with CheckOut in November 1999--will take control of the site's music and video sales. Amplified will operate the back-end engine of the Web store.\nCheckOut was formed in May 1999 by Ovitz and Richard Wolpert, a partner for Yucaipa and former president of Disney Online. Despite the initial fanfare garnered from its relationship with Ovitz, CheckOut struggled to get a foothold in the Internet industry--either in content or in retail.\nIndustry experts say the large failing of CheckOut is that it never established itself strongly as an entertainment destination or as an e-commerce site. By playing both sides of the fence, the company couldn't fully succeed at either. Market pressures in the industry lent to further woes for the company.\nReel.com suffered a similar identity crisis two years after video chain Hollywood Entertainment bought the entertainment site, when it realized that online content and retailing are difficult to house under the same roof.\n\"Everybody's losing money... We're past the point of thinking attaching a famous name to a Web site has much significance at all,\" said Malcolm Maclachalan, media e-commerce analyst at IDC.\n\"They're in a bunch of low-profit businesses; any way out they have to keep alive is probably a good move right now,\" he added.\nSigns of the CheckOut sale cropped up early this year. The company canceled its affiliate program Jan. 6, according to Geoffrey Kleinman, founder of DVD Talk.com, an affiliate Web site to CheckOut. Kleinman said that canceling such programs is usually a sure sign that a company is going out business.\nBased in Beverly Hills, Calif., CheckOut sells music, videos and DVDs on the Internet.

{"idx": "28847", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Talk about a blow to the ego -- Los Angeles is about to be dumped by \"Ugly Betty.\" But the impending breakup isn't about something so shallow as looks. The popular ABC sitcom is poised to leave Hollywood for something much more substantial: money.\nABC Studios, which produces the comedy for its corporate sibling, may move the show to New York after two seasons here because the Empire State just tripled its tax incentives for film and TV. If it happens, the move would threaten more than 130 crew members and dozens of vendors that supply goods and services.\nAlthough Hollywood has long complained about movies being shot in locales with lower costs, television production here has enjoyed healthy growth. That's why the news about \"Ugly Betty,\" a show already in production, carried more than the usual sting. The implication was that New York's new incentives were so lucrative they overcame the relocation expenses as well as the city's relatively high cost of doing business.\nBefore every gaffer and set designer in Tinseltown starts to panic about wintering on the East Coast, though, they should remember that \"Ugly Betty\" isn't leaving so much as it's going home. The pilot for the show, which is set in Manhattan and Queens, was shot in New York with subsidies from taxpayers there. During the first two seasons of filming on Hollywood sound stages, the show used special effects to give outdoor scenes verisimilitude. By moving back to New York, \"Ugly Betty\" won't need to rely on such tricks of the craft.\nWe'd like to see our political leaders work to keep productions like \"Ugly Betty,\" but the larger lesson is that once a state gets into the game of film subsidies, it has to keep raising the stakes. New York's initial 10% tax credit was trumped by Connecticut, which started offering a 30% credit in mid-2006. Within a year, Connecticut was attracting more than $300 million worth of TV and film business -- much of it at its neighbor's expense -- prompting Albany to respond in kind.\nThese states have small production businesses compared with Hollywood, meaning they can offer subsidies without providing windfalls to hundreds of films and TV shows that are already in place or have other reasons to shoot here. Every \"Ugly Betty\" that's wooed by incentives from other states will cost California millions in lost taxes and productivity, but it's hard to create a competing subsidy that won't unduly reward the ones that weren't going anywhere."}

The growing number of Syrian, Afghan, Iraqi, and other women making the treacherous journey into the European Union has placed a heightened focus on the unique risks facing women and girls during migration.\nThe increased occurrence of sexual violence and exploitation, unintended pregnancies and pregnancy complications, unsafe deliveries, maternal mortality, inadequate newborn care, early and forced marriage, and sexually transmitted infections like HIV necessitates a response that prioritizes sexual and reproductive health (SRH). The European Parliament acknowledged this in early March 2016 with the adoption of the report \u201con the situation of women refugees and asylum seekers in the EU,\u201d which calls for full access to SRH services and rights, including access to safe abortion. Yet, even with recognition of the problem\u2019s magnitude, SRH is too often overlooked and underfunded in emergency situations like the current refugee crisis.\nAlthough the sexual and reproductive health needs of refugee women and girls are not being met on a broad scale, there are actors on the ground working to achieve this end. One method for addressing the gaps in SRH for refugees is the Minimum Initial Service Package. Developed in 2010 by the Inter-agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, the MISP is a set of actions meant to facilitate delivery of basic reproductive health services while planning for comprehensive SRH access. These services include prevention and treatment of gender-based violence, maternal and newborn care, provisions to reduce HIV, and increasing access to contraception, among other targets. Though the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) and other organizations work to ensure its implementation, it is unknown to what percentage of refugees it is currently accessible.\nThe lack of SRH access is particularly prominent in makeshift camps such as \u201cthe Jungle,\u201d currently under destruction in Calais, and neighboring Grande-Synthe. With the French government neglecting the refugees on its northern coast, the camps\u2019 management has fallen to nongovernmental organizations such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res that lack both the required funds and resources to provide necessary services. The result has been terrible public health conditions such as unsanitary toilet and washing facilities, heavy flooding, and minimal access to health care. For sexual and reproductive health, the MISP has not been implemented. This absence of even the most basic services within the camp means that women and girls need to travel four miles to the hospital clinic in Calais for prenatal care and access to contraception.\nThe case of Calais is important not only from a human rights perspective, but also as a starting point in the discussion of how to most effectively address SRH in the refugee crisis. As border restrictions continue to tighten and refugees in Greece appear stranded, the conditions in the overflowing reception centers and camps deteriorate. The European Union must support its commitments to women and girls by expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care for refugees within its borders.\nTo successfully reach the growing refugee population, funding for SRH needs to be both increased and sustained. Greater funding could help to implement the MISP in more camps and transit points along the current migrant routes. Expanded communication outreach efforts in locations where the MISP or additional services are available have the potential to increase awareness among both men and women of their health options. Part of this outreach is ensuring that there are enough Arabic and Farsi translators, specifically female interpreters. Though there are challenges to implementing MISP, its benefits can be lifesaving"}

Each jurisdiction is expected to take a vote on the agreement in the coming months.\nSan Anselmo Town Manager David Donery is a parent of a White Hill Middle School student who rides the bus.\nSo far, the yellow bus program in the Ross Valley runs six buses to and from White Hill middle and Hidden Valley elementary schools with the county, San Anselmo and Fairfax contributing funds to reduce the cost of bus passes. The program was designed to free up Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, the major thoroughfare connecting Highway 101 traffic in Central Marin to West Marin.\nThis year, 930 one-way bus passes have been sold at $395 each, according to Marin Transit.\nMill Valley and Tiburon/Belvedere also provide the yellow bus program for K-8 students, with Marin County and those municipalities contributing funds to reduce the cost of passes.\nThe Reed Union School District, serving families on the Tiburon Peninsula, was the first district to work with Marin Transit to develop a yellow bus program designed to get cars off Tiburon Boulevard during the morning and afternoon commute, said Robert Betts, Marin Transit\u2019s director of operations who helped develop the program.\nIn 2016, officials with the school district, Belvedere and Tiburon formed the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Relief Joint Powers Agency. After several years in operation, it has been pointed to as the example of a successful bus program, unclogging the roadway leading to Highway 101, Betts said.\nThis year Reed Union has sold 1,328 one-way passes for $315 each. The program operates seven buses to and from its three campuses.\nBuilding off the model set by Reed Union, the Mill Valley School District began its own bus program with two buses serving two schools. At $360 each, 172 one-way annual passes have been sold this year.\n\u201cClearly, the three yellow bus programs have been valuable in not only getting kids to school safely, but getting cars off the road,\u201d Betts said.\nFor years Marin Transit has had a deal with school districts across the county, offering a youth pass to students in an effort to get cars off the road. A six-month pass costs $175 and a year pass is $325. It allows pass holders to board local routes to schools without paying the additional fare. But that program caters to older students, specifically high-schoolers, Betts said.\nEarlier this year, the Marin County Civil Grand Jury released a report saying that Marin Transit should take the lead in creating a countywide school bus program that would be funded by the county and its cities and towns.\nBetts said Marin Transit has formed an ad hoc committee that is studying where they can expand. But the agency is limited in what it can do because there is no existing facility suitable to house the yellow buses in Marin. What they\u2019re left with is contracting bus companies from out of county, Betts said.\nMarin voters earlier this month passed a renewal of a half"}

Think of it as the late-shift clerk's version of those screaming rabbit recordings that ATF SWAT teams use to flush people out of religious cult compounds.\nActually, Taryn Miller can help you with that. When not recording critically adored experimental pop under the name Your Friend, the 24-year-old artist moonlights at her hometown record store in Lawrence, Kansas. Her eviction strategies of choice include albums by avant-garde musician Bill Orcutt and ambient industrialists Nurse With Wound.\n\"It's actually stuff that we would probably listen to, but we can just tell that they won't,\" says Miller. \"I've also used The Shaggs a few times, just to see people's reactions, like 'Is this a real record?' And I'm like, 'Yeah. We have it. Do you want to buy it?'\"\nYour Friend's debut album, Gumption, released in January on Domino Records, sounds nothing like The Shaggs, a band Rolling Stone cruelly likened to \"a lobotomized Trapp Family singers.\" It doesn't sound like Bill Orcutt or Nurse With Wound, either, although the album probably goes further in that direction than Miller's 2014 debut EP, Jekyll/Hyde.\nIn fact, were it not for \"Expectations/Reality,\" the 61/2-minute closing cut on the self-recorded EP, it would be easy to mistake Jekyll/Hyde and Gumption for the work of two different artists.\n\"I've always had the desire to make records more like Gumption, but I'm just now starting to get the opportunity to do that,\" says Miller, who used her newly found resources to enlist the aid of producer Nicolas Vernhes, whose other clients include Deerhunter and Animal Collective.\nTogether with a handful of additional musicians from Lawrence's close-knit music community, Miller and Vernhes shifted Your Friend's focus from relatively austere guitar-based songs to a much more textured and evocative sound.\nOn tracks like \"Come Back From It,\" Miller's sublimely hypnotic vocals \u2014 which fall somewhere along the spectrum between London Grammar's Hannah Reid and Nico from the Velvet Underground \u2014 are immersed in subtly looped synthesizers, understated electric guitar, motorik rhythms, and nearly as much echo as a Lee Perry dub-side.\n\"The demos are, in a lot of ways, unrecognizable,\" says the former high-school athlete and band geek. \"A lot of the songs came together in the studio, and would finally just surface.

The merged company, aiming to capitalize on the growing need for infrastructure projects, especially highways in the West, will do business in 21 states from Virginia to California. Vulcan will assume $130 million of CalMat debt.\nAs part of the deal, CalMat, with about 1,800 employees, will become a subsidiary of Vulcan, continue to be based in Los Angeles and keep its name. Because the two firms do not compete, no production facilities are expected to be closed, said Donald M. James, Vulcan Materials' chairman and chief executive. CalMat has more than 40 sites producing concrete and asphalt or handling debris landfill in California, Arizona and New Mexico, including several in central Los Angeles County.\n\"Our combined geographic diversity and strong capital base will position us for better growth than Vulcan Materials and CalMat could achieve as separate companies,\" James said. \"CalMat is the first choice we would have for a merger partner in this industry. We like the areas it's in.\"\nCalMat, which traces it origins to a company formed in 1893, serves California, Arizona and New Mexico from offices in Bakersfield, Irwindale, San Diego and Phoenix. Among other projects, the firm is providing asphalt for the $1.9-billion Alameda Corridor, a rail and truck expressway connecting downtown Los Angeles and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n\"CalMat's roots in California go back more than a century, and we are proud of what we have accomplished,\" said A. Frederick Gerstell, CalMat's chairman and chief executive, who will become a vice chairman and a director of Vulcan.\n\"In a consolidating, fragmented industry, we felt that we could better achieve our goals as their partner. I don't see this as a loss for Los Angeles. We'll be stronger, our capital base will be bigger and we'll be able to grow,\" Gerstell said.\nUnder the agreement, Vulcan will offer to pay $31 a share for CalMat, a nearly 14% premium. In New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday, CalMat's stock rose 56 cents a share to close at $27.19. Vulcan's shares closed at $122.69 on Friday, down $1.56 in NYSE trading.\nCalMat's stock price surged 49% last year on expectations that it was poised to benefit from the comeback of the building industry in California.

What I do find interesting in the debate about the wind farm is it seems that those here in the Old Fort School District who oppose the wind farm are the same folks who are against any kind of levy for our schools. And those who are for the wind farm think the schools will benefit financially from the wind farm. How\u2019s the school\u2019s \u201ccasino\u201d money working out? And then you have the farmers who feel they will make money off a turbine on their property, while it will lower the property\u2019s value. We hear people complain about property rights, but ignore the rights of property owners who don\u2019t want a turbine on their property. All the things I\u2019ve stated above are valid reasons to support or reject the wind farm. Everyone, whether for or against, sounds like hen that just laid an egg and wants everyone to know about it.\nI completely understand folks wanting to get money for our schools. In the past, we have had board members that thought their \u201cagenda\u201d should override the wishes of their constituents. Thankfully, those members have either been voted out or moved on to be commissioner, who, by the way, still doesn\u2019t listen to her constituents. We now have a fiscally responsible school board that has been showing some real oversight into the operations of the district so maybe we should consider a levy if need be. But to depend on money from the wind farm folks sounds irresponsible to me.\nI completely understand the farmers, as well. They are in a business that is unpredictable at best. Weather, markets and things not under their control can be devastating to their financial security. It sounds great to have a turbine with guaranteed income and no operating costs. But really there is a cost. And I don\u2019t just mean property values. Friendships may be lost. Commissioner Mike Kerschner, I believe, said something like this wind farm is pitting neighbors against neighbors and family against family. Sometimes we have to realize how precious our friendships are.\nWhy am I against the wind farm? You have to draw a line somewhere. When I drive to Van Wert and see the wind farm there, it just makes me sick. The beauty of rural America is gone in Van Wert. It\u2019s not much different than driving around a big city, with all those unnatural turbines sprouting up everywhere. I don\u2019t know about the noise or the dangers or the affects on wildlife or everything else I\u2019ve heard about and frankly don\u2019t believe half of. I\u2019m just disgusted that we may have to ruin our friendships, family relationships and our beautiful rural area because of the all-mighty dollar."}

Pride, in the players who regrouped after a wobbly fourth set to outlast Nebraska in Saturday\u2019s grueling five-set title match at Target Center.\nWith equal measures of talent, heart and will, Stanford and Nebraska produced an unforgettable finale to Minnesota\u2019s first volleyball Final Four in 30 years. The first title match since 2009 to go to five sets was a toss-up all the way to the end \u2014 and even that was momentarily in doubt. The Cardinal began its celebration after Meghan McClure\u2019s back-row kill, but Nebraska coach John Cook made one last stand, unsuccessfully challenging the point.\nIt was upheld, concluding a 2-hour, 37-minute match. Though there were 137 kills, 147 digs, 20.5 blocks and 353 kill attempts, only one point separated the winner from the loser in the Cardinal\u2019s 28-26, 22-25, 25-16, 15-25, 15-12 victory.\n\u201cIt was a great night for volleyball,\u2019\u2019 Cook said. \u201cTwo of the most storied programs in college volleyball went at it, put on a great match.\nEven without a hometown team, total attendance for the tournament was announced as 35,921, second only to the 36,863 that turned out in Kansas City, Mo., last year to watch Nebraska take the crown. NCAA officials said 18,113 people attended Saturday\u2019s final, second-most in history for a championship match and third-most for any single session of the tournament.\nThey saw a taut match that featured remarkable individual performances. Mikaela Foecke, Nebraska\u2019s sublime senior outside hitter, had a career-high 27 kills, with many coming when the Cornhuskers needed them most. Stanford libero Morgan Hentz finished with 32 digs and shared the tournament\u2019s most outstanding player award with teammate Kathryn Plummer, who had 19 kills.\nFor Cook, the loss in the title match wasn\u2019t the most painful part of his evening. The coach now must say goodbye to Foecke and Kenzie Maloney, two seniors who Cook said \u201cwilled this team to win\u2019\u2019 when no one expected the Huskers to contend for a championship.\nTheir leadership turned a collection of individuals into a strong unit that kept improving, and they set a new standard for postseason success. Foecke and Maloney went 21-2 in NCAA tournament matches during their careers, the best run in program history.\nCook had considered the 2017 NCAA title season his finest year at Nebraska. This one surpassed it, even though it ended without the big trophy.\nIn the locker room down the hallway, the talk centered on beginnings, not endings. After the Cardinal won the championship in 2016, coach John Dunning retired; he was replaced by Hambly, who had been head coach at Illinois for eight seasons.

That much was clear when Berkshire Hathaway CEO and the world's 4th-richest man, Warren Buffett, was asked about Bitcoin on CNBC on Friday.\n\"Stay away from it,\" Buffett responded. \"It's a mirage basically, it's a method of transmitting money, it's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that... a check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money?\"\nBuffett also compared Bitcoin to a \"very fast money order.\"\nThe CNBC roundtable accepted and briefly pondered the Oracle's argument before moving on without pressing him on what would appear to be his fundamental misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is and how it is currently functioning in the wild.\nNow, I'm not normally in the habit of being particularly bullish on Bitcoin, nor of arguing with perhaps the most successful self-made human ever, but Buffett is just wrong here and he wasn't questioned by the business press around him, either because they view the totality of his words as gospel or because they don't understand Bitcoin any better themselves.\nTo be clear, I'm not saying his advice to stay away from Bitcoin is wrong, but the comparison of Bitcoin to a check or money order or other method of transmitting money is the same as lumping Bitcoin in with the likes of PayPal. This is clearly wrong.\nBitcoin, for the most part of the past year has been treated essentially as a volatile commodity that has encouraged rampant speculation. In that respect, it's more like gold than a check, which has no intrinsic value in and of itself.\nHowever, unlike gold, Bitcoin also has a higher degree of liquidity on its own (admittedly among a tiny but growing number of companies, most notably Overstock.com ).\nThis combination of perceived value and the ability to function as a currency put Bitcoin in the same category as the U.S. dollars in your wallet on a trip to Toronto or Montreal (if dollars were very volatile) -- they're not official, but they do have intrinsic value and you could probably find someone to accept them for goods and services. If not, they're easy to exchange into a more widely accepted currency.\nOn the other hand, I can't say I've ever been able to walk in to ScotiaBank in Montreal and convince them to hand over $600 in exchange for a blank check.\nSo far, the Bitcoin faithful have not taken the Oracle's warning to heart.

Su's comment didn't sound like any attempt to steer the audience with false information since she was responding to a question from an analyst. And as one of Microsoft's hardware partners, AMD would be abreast of the specific time frame for launching Windows 10.\nMicrosoft has previously stated that Windows 10 would roll out in the summer, so a late July date sounds feasible. The company has been working to produce a new version of Windows designed to avoid the mistakes of Windows 8. That version was criticized by PC users for its tablet-focused approach and its dual personality Start screen and desktop environment. As such, Microsoft is attempting to fashion a more user-friendly OS with a more cohesive environment for PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.\nThe company has also been eager to seek the feedback of users as it tweaks Windows 10. In October, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Technical Preview , a work-in-progress of the new OS that gave people a chance to sample it and offer opinions. Since then, Microsoft has rolled out new builds of the OS on a regular basis as it incorporates suggestions from testers and tries to fine-tune the new version to win over users soured by Windows 8.\nWindows 10 brings back the Start menu that was jettisoned in Windows 8, this time providing quick access to both Windows apps and traditional desktop programs. The new version takes a cue from Windows Phone by incorporating Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant. A new browser code-named Spartan promises a different approach to Web browsing beyond that of Internet Explorer. Further, the OS sports a host of tweaks and enhancements to its menus, screens and other features.\nMicrosoft will host its annual Build developers conference later this month. That's when the company is expected to reveal more details about Windows 10 and possibly announce an official launch date.\nAt least one question remains regarding Windows 10: does Microsoft have enough time to get it right? As a participant in the Windows Insider program, which lets people download and install Windows 10 and then give feedback on the new OS, I've seen improvement and finesse in the OS since the Windows 10 Technical Preview launched in October. But in certain ways, the OS still feels like a work in progress. Assuming the late July date is accurate, Microsoft has just three more months to wrap it up.\nA Microsoft spokesperson told CNET: \"Microsoft has said Windows 10 will launch this summer. We have nothing additional to share.\"\nAMD did not respond to a request for comment.\nUpdate, 4:45 a.m. PT April 21: Microsoft's comment has been added."}

But how is this new trend cutting into the auto industry?\nSurging petrol prices and growing inner-city populations are driving a rapid growth in Australia's car sharing industry. In the five years to 2012-13 industry revenue soared to $43.1 million, according to research company IBISWorld. Further data shows industry growth in the same period was an annual 25 per cent, but is expected to slow slightly to 18.7 per cent.\nCar-sharing is already big business in the US and Europe, where it began in the 1990s. In fact, the popularity of car-sharing overseas has seen many motorists ditch their privately-owned car. Researchers at the University of California found one car-share vehicle replacing between six and 23 cars in the US and four and 10 cars in Europe.\nWill Davies, chief executive of peer-to-peer car share company Car Next Door, says car-sharing in Australia has had little effect on the auto industry, but that's set to change.\n\"We're not taking business away from the car yards and the hire-car companies in any real sense yet,\" he says.\n\"But our vision is that in the next five to 10 years, Car Next Door's peer-to-peer car-sharing model will lead to many thousand fewer cars being sold and owned in Australian cities.\n\"We want to see a large-scale de-car-ing of our cities. If we don't change the way we think about car ownership, then the growth in population is going to leave our cities more and more car-choked.\"\nCar Next Door, which launched in 2012, lets members borrow cars from car owners including apartment co-ops and businesses. Davies says the company's fleet has 100 cars being shared by about 1700 borrowers. The average car is shared around five times per month with top car owners earning a profit of around $6000 per year.\nIn five years, Car Next Door aims to have 7000 cars being lent to 110,000 to 140,000 people.\nCar hire giant Hertz took a proactive step into the car sharing market in 2010 when it purchased Flexicar, one of Australia's earliest car share companies.\nBut Hertz car-share general manager Greg Giraud says car-sharing poses little threat to the car manufacturing or car hire industries.\n\"We see car-sharing as an alternative to car ownership and car hire as a product of the travel industry,\" he says.\nThe growth of the car-share industry comes at a unique time in Australia's automotive history. Major auto manufacturers Toyota, Holden and Ford will stop production in Australia between 2016 and 2017, opening the door to more imported cars from China and the US.\nRising global production costs are to blame for the closure of Australian made Toyotas, Holdens and Fords, but the closures arguably reflect a shift in attitudes towards transport.\nTristan Sender, chief executive of car-share company GoGet, says manufacturers need to embrace changing trends.\n\"The perception of car-only transport will probably be replaced by an understanding of the diversity of transport options at our disposal of which car-share is one dependable option,\" he says.\n\"That said, GoGet is also cultivating strong relationships with innovative car companies who"}

The researchers found no significant associations with prostate, colorectal, lung, breast, or any other cancers.\nResearchers evaluated the association between chronic kidney disease and the risk of incident cancer in a large, diverse, community-based population linked to a regional cancer registry. As was hypothesized, they found an independent, graded increased risk of kidney cancer with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, the flow rate at which the kidneys filter fluid. The study examined all people with measured kidney function who are receiving care within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large, integrated health care delivery system providing care to 3.2 million members. The Kaiser Permanente Cancer Registry links to the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Registry that collects detailed data on incident cancer site, initial treatment and other patient characteristics.\nResearch scientists adjusted for a large set of factors that may confound the relationship between level of kidney function and cancer risk. The risk of renal cancer retained a robust and graded association with renal function. As chronic kidney disease worsened, the risk of renal cancer increased, they explained. There was a similar association between estimated GFR and urinary tract (excluding prostate) cancer, although the magnitude of this association was less pronounced than observed with renal cancer, they added.\nAdditional authors on the study include Natalia Udaltsovea, PhD, with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research; Juan Ordonez, MD, with the Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center department of nephrology; and Paul Russo, MD, with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Department of Surgery.

One of my traditions is simple: I spend one of my days off going from store to store, doing the bulk of my Christmas shopping while enjoying the holiday decorations and ever-present Christmas carols.\nOn Friday as I prepared to walk out the door and begin my holiday ritual, I paused. After a moment of thought, I walked back to my desk where I picked up my badge and gun, neither of which is generally a part of my holiday shopping. As I clipped on my badge and holstered my gun, it became clear how different the world was.\nA few hours earlier as I logged on to my computer to take care of some long-overdue writing before I went out, I learned that a small Connecticut town had become the latest victim of a horrific mass shooting.\nAs a police officer in Aurora, Colorado \u2014 a city that is only just beginning to recover from one of the largest mass shootings in the history of the United States \u2014 the news stopped me in my tracks.\nBut I wasn\u2019t shocked that it had happened. I wasn\u2019t in a state of disbelief. I was outraged that it had happened again, and that many more families were now mourning the senseless loss of their loved ones. I thought back to the first such incidents in my adult life \u2014 one in Arkansas and another in Colorado \u2014 and I wondered when it was ever going to stop.\nAs I drove from one store to another, I realized that instead of listening to a radio station that was playing continuous holiday music, I was instead listening to a different station that was dedicating the day to live coverage of the tragedy \u2014 most of which was filled by commentators, investigative reporters, and self-proclaimed experts on one topic or another that sought to explain what had happened in some way.\nI found myself just as angry at one senator who immediately called for increased gun control legislation as I was at another senator who stated that the entire incident would have been prevented if even one law-abiding citizen with a concealed carry permit had been present to stop the assailant.\nI wondered to myself how devoid of any common decency these two \u2014 and so many more like them \u2014 must be to use the victims for political posturing while they likely still lay where they had been murdered.\nSoon after that, I found my anger growing as an acquaintance or relative of the alleged suspect made a public statement that he suffered from autism and had not always received the help he needed, as if this somehow explained his actions.\nThen I found myself at a boiling point when I heard the relative of a survivor comment that they believed their loved one had escaped death because God had a plan for them, as though they felt God had no plans whatsoever for the innocent victims who were only at the beginning of their young lives.\nMorning slipped into afternoon as the stream of politicians, commentators and subject-matter experts continued their minute-by-minute coverage of the tragedy, and eventually I found that I could no longer listen to it even though I felt I needed to.\nIt was only then, when my anger subsided and a sense of clarity returned to me, that I realized I was angry that our world has become a place where someone can find a reason \u2014 any reason \u2014 to direct mass-violence at innocent children.\nThat people seek to explain, theorize or justify something that is without any possible justification.

It turns out, population surveys were ignoring a super-colony just off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula's northern tip.\nWith the help of satellite images, scientists were able to locate 1.5 million Ad\u00e9lie penguins congregating on a remote, jagged outcropping of islands known as the Danger Islands.\n\"Until recently, the Danger Islands weren't known to be an important penguin habitat,\" Heather Lynch, an associate professor of ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University, said in a news release.\nSatellite images of the island chain didn't reveal penguins themselves, but researchers were able to pick out the telltale signs of a large colony -- large guano stains.\nInspired by their discovery of seabird excrement, researchers set off in search of the birds themselves. In 2015, a research ship delivered a team of scientists to the islands. The team used a drone to help them survey the islands.\n\"The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,\" said Hanumant Singh, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University.\nSingh helped scientists develop the imaging software. He also designed algorithms to scan the collected images and identify the location of penguin nesting sites.\nIce loss and rising temperatures are a threat to penguins in both the Arctic and Antarctica, but the latest discovery suggests some colonies and their habitats remain resilient.\n\"Not only do the Danger Islands hold the largest population of Ad\u00e9lie penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula, they also appear to have not suffered the population declines found along the western side of Antarctic Peninsula that are associated with recent climate change,\" said Michael Polito, a researcher at Louisiana State University.\nAdditional surveys of the Danger Islands and the penguins that live there could help scientists better understand what makes the habitat there more desirable.\n\"The population of Ad\u00e9lies on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula is different from what we see on the west side, for example,\" said Stephanie Jenouvrier, a seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. \"We want to understand why.

Basically, we view that to get out of poverty, you need a good education. So start investing. That's the way forward.\"\nThe Statistics Canada study was made public on the same day First Nations education directors began a two-day meeting Ottawa to discuss ways to improve on-reserve education after failed efforts by the previous Conservative government.\nFunding increases for First Nations schools have been capped by the government at 2 per cent for two decades, which the AFN says has left the annual base amount spent per First Nations student running thousands of dollars below what is spent on children attending provincially funded schools.\nThe Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to remove that cap and invest $515-million in core annual funding for First Nations primary and secondary education \u2013 an amount that would increase to $750-million over four years. Mr. Trudeau has also promised to spend $500-million in education infrastructure on reserves and to invest $50-million more a year in postsecondary funding for First Nations students.\nCarolyn Bennett, the Indigenous Affair Minister, said the Statistics Canada study is exciting, but it is also something the government has known for some time. \"When people get the opportunity for an excellent education, they do extraordinarily well,\" she said in an interview with The Globe and Mail.\nThe challenge, Dr. Bennett said, has been to ensure that indigenous girls and boys make it through high school so they can qualify to get into a postsecondary program. \"We need to put our attention to all levels of this in order to achieve that kind of success that has been demonstrated in the report today,\" she said.\nDuring an address to the First Nations education directors, the minister announced money for new school facilities in 20 First Nations across the country.\nThe Statistics Canada survey looked at the educational and economic status of Canada's indigenous women, including M\u00e9tis and Inuit and First Nations, living both on- and off-reserve.\nIt found that in general, in 2011, those indigenous women who had attained university degrees were doing well both in terms of jobs and the amount of money they were taking home.\nThe rate of employment among First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit women who had at least a bachelor's degree"}

Instead of just servicing the needs of the commercial banking clients, relationship managers get to know their clients and their business needs by building and maintaining ongoing relationships.\nOne of the primary roles of the commercial banking relationship manager is sales. You\u2019ll have a quota and regular goals to meet. You\u2018ll research new business prospects and pitch the companies with your own bank\u2019s products. You\u2019ll call on and make appointments with new businesses and existing companies banking elsewhere. You\u2019ll establish new lines of credit and investment accounts for your clients and develop prospect lists for additional recruiting. To support your efforts, you might take clients to dinners, golf outings or other events. You\u2019ll make presentations and prepare spreadsheets and documents supporting the value of your products and services.\nWhen you\u2019re new to a bank, you may be given existing clients to manage as well as a territory or industry to solicit. Part of your responsibilities as a relationship manager is to periodically review the existing accounts of all your clients. You should review investments to make sure your clients are taking advantage of the best options and offer additional lines of credit when appropriate. You\u2019ll analyze each client\u2019s current financial status through spreadsheets and analytical programs to make sure they are taking advantage of all the products and services your bank has that can help each business grow and prosper with little risk.\nIf you\u2019re going to make educated recommendations to your clients, you must understand their business model and be able to show how your banking products easily integrate into their strategic plans. While banks prefer to hire financial professionals with varied business backgrounds, it\u2019s impossible for you to know every industry you might serve. To expand your horizons, you\u2019ll need to research companies and the role they play in their various industries. Study trends and analyze the competition to confidently present new lines to your clients and instill trust with your extensive knowledge of their industry.\nUltimately, you are the primary financial advisor for the companies with whom you form relationships. It\u2019s up to you to utilize your research to find out where the company needs help. A relationship manager knows when a merchant needs to upgrade credit card services, for example, or take advantage of tax credits by leasing rather than purchasing new equipment. You should call on your client list regularly whether you have something to sell or advice to give or not. Relationships develop so that you should be on a first-name basis with your clients, know their birth dates and how many children they have. Successful relationship managers also know when their clients need outside help and make referrals when necessary.\nRay, Linda. \"Job Description for a Commercial Banking Relationship Manager.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/job-description-commercial-banking-relationship-manager-21461.html.

(Each would have a California or Texas, and each would have a Wyoming or Rhode Island.) Then each group would be assigned a time slot. In the 1996 election, the order might be Group B first, followed by C, D and A. By rotation, each block would be guaranteed the earliest slot once every four elections. In the first four weeks, one group would conduct primaries, perhaps each choosing their preferred date within that period.\nEven with the first 12 states holding primaries in a four-week period, any candidate could remain viable to the next stage by focusing energy on select states within a given block.\nOne advantage of this sort of system is its flexibility. For instance, we could create three blocks of six weeks each, or five blocks of three weeks each.\nThe current anarchic system has led us to the six-week media assault that will determine our nation's presidential nominees this electoral winter. It cries out for a well-planned alternative."}

Going from Apple to Arkansas, I was struck by the variety in this country. Given that, it\u2019s a compliment to our civility that we hold together as well as we do.\nI felt the pride and goodness of people everywhere. Philadelphians, while a bit apologetic that they are neither DC or NYC, love their city. The people of Arkansas have a good humor about their reputation. Even though they still joke \u201cthank God for Mississippi\u201d when it comes to leading the country in obesity, teen pregnancies, lack of education, and poverty, they are making impressive progress as a state. These days, joking about Arkansas that way is like joking about England\u2019s food \u2014 it shows you haven\u2019t been there in a while.\nBut the Deep South wears its conservatism like Seattleites wear their liberalism.

My last stop was Oklahoma City, where I enjoyed talking to a huge crowd of 1,400. People even drove in from out of state. From the big turnout to the VIP meals before and after, it was a delightful experience.\nWhile news stories (like retired generals making fortunes on the boards of companies that sell the USA weaponry) seemed particularly annoying on this trip, traveling around the USA made me feel good about the people of this country.\nWherever I went, people were trying to be good citizens and caring neighbors. They enjoyed the edgy message I brought with my \u201cTravel as a Political Act\u201d lectures, and I enjoyed the caliber of their character. I feel I planted some progressive seeds.

Just exhale.\nA new analysis by SmartAsset, the personal finance and technology website, shows it would take an annual salary of $48,384 to comfortably afford monthly home payments of $1,452 in Chicago \u2014 that includes mortgage payments, property taxes and homeowners insurance.\nTo come up with the $48,384 figure, SmartAsset plugged the median home value in Chicago \u2014 $243,900, based on data from the Census Bureau \u2014 into its mortgage calculator and assumed that buyers were debt-free, made a 20 percent down payment, took out a 30-year mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate and spent 0.5 percent on homeowners insurance.\nThat salary figure is lower than Chicago\u2019s median household income of $53,006, according to the Census Bureau.\nThat\u2019s a step in the right direction of the American Dream, considering one estimate says a Chicagoan would need a job that pays at least $96,600 a year to be able to rent a two-bedroom apartment solo in the city.\nAccording to Thomson, vice president of agent development at @properties, there are homes at that median price point throughout all of the city\u2019s 77 community areas. Per January sales figures from the Chicago Association of Realtors, about 44 percent of total listings were at or below $265,000.\n\u201cChicago is much more in line with what people are making, which makes getting into a home much more easier in the city,\u201d she said.\nAJ Smith, vice president of financial education at SmartAsset, agrees and hopes studies like theirs inspire people to look a little deeper into their personal finances.\nShe said the various calculators on the site (Rent versus buy?

The first is that oil prices have plunged since early July, which tends to pressure solar stocks despite the fact that the two energy sources rarely compete head to head.\nPotentially more concerning is the pending rise in interest rates, which won't directly impact solar panel sales but could make solar projects less economical given their long life spans. When debt is cheap it makes each kWh of electricity less costly, so if rates rise so will the effective price of solar energy.\nNow what: Neither of these factors are deal breakers for renewable energy but they clearly can dominate the market in the short-term.

During the April-December period of 2016, it had netted Rs 16,000 crore in profit.\nChairman VK Sharma on Tuesday said the latest number is provisional, as it is yet to be approved by Parliament. Sharma was replying to query on how the Corporation can assure 8 per cent annual return on its new product Jeevan Umang that was launched on Tuesday in a falling interest rate regime.\nHe defended the assured 8 per cent return on the new product saying on average it nets 7.5 per cent from huge exposure of around Rs 18 lakh crore in government bonds alone.\nIt can be noted that the Corporation made this stellar gain even as its equity investment, which stood at around Rs 5.11 lakh crore as of March 2017, have been steadily falling. It slumped to Rs 40,000 crore in FY17, from Rs 50,000 crore in FY16 and a high of Rs 65,000 crore in FY15.\nSharma parried a question on whether LIC will pump more money in equities as the markets have been on a song for the past many months, scaling new life-time peaks, saying traditionally LIC invests 20 per cent of its investible corpus into equities. But he did not quantify the corpus.\n\"Our stated objective is to secure the money of the policyholder and also his life and not just make profits.

In FY16 this stood at Rs 97,777.47 crore.

Currency issues continued to plague its Colombian stores, but customer traffic was soft even after accounting for that unusual situation.\nPriceSmart's two new warehouses helped push revenue slightly higher, but sales at existing locations declined. Meanwhile, pricing pressure sent profitability lower, leading to a significant decline in net income.\nThe comparable-store sales growth trend worsened, declining to a negative 0.9% rate over the past three quarters from a negative 0.5% pace through Q1 and Q2.\nMembership income rose by less than 3% to $11.5 million.\nStore opening expenses declined sharply as no new warehouses were prepped for launch.\nOperating margin fell to 4% from 5%, which translated into $26 million of operating income compared to $34 million a year ago.\nWeakness in the Colombian market played a key role in the lower comps results, according to executives. \"Comparable warehouse sales were negatively impacted by the devaluation of the Colombian peso from the year ago period,\" management explained in a press release. Excluding those six locations from the calculation yields a 2.2% comps gain over the last three quarters rather than the 1% reported decrease. Still, PriceSmart was growing at a 3% pace through the first two quarters of the year, and so the weak selling environment extends beyond just Colombia.\nThe struggles in that economy were also a big reason why operating margin declined. Three months ago, CEO Jose Luis Laparte told investors that PriceSmart had \"taken margin reductions in that market in an effort to solidify our position for the future.\" It's likely that more price cuts this quarter continued that weakening profitability trend.\nLaparte and his executive team aim to get comps growth to breakeven in Colombia, and still see it as an important market to the company's future. However, these earnings results demonstrate that the economic situation there is likely to keep pressuring sales growth, profits, and membership fee income in the meantime.\nIn fact, the sluggish business environment has continued into PriceSmart's fiscal fourth quarter. Comps declined by 2% during the month of June, the retailer said."}

I don't know why I am here.\" The judge responded by saying it would be sorted out in court.\nWednesday morning, the Marion County prosecutor's office filed formal charges against Orrego-Savala. He faces two counts of causing death when operating a motor vehicle with an ACE of .15 or more and two counts of failure to remain at the scene of an accident.\nBond for a drunk driving suspect in a similar case would be $40,000, but since Orrego-Savala is considered a flight risk, his bond was set at $200,000 at an initial hearing Wednesday morning.\nRyan Mears, Chief Trial Attorney for the Marion County prosecutor's office says they will treat this case as they would any other, despite comments from President Trump or Orrego-Savala's immigration status.\n\"That doesn't determine how we prosecute a case. That doesn't determine how we charge a case. That doesn't determine what type of sentence we're going to ask for. Our concern is trying to bring justice to those families and we owe that to all families of any crimes here in Marion County,\" said Mears.\nOrrego-Savala's attorney, Jorge Torres, says he's concerned about his client getting a fair trial in Marion County.\n\"The first thing that is being posted out in the media is his immigration status. Let me be clear here. I think, and I believe that, and this applies to everyone, drunk driving has nothing to do with immigration status. It applies to everyone in general,\" said Torres.\nOrrego-Savala's next court appearance is scheduled for March 27.\nPolice say Edwin Jackson was the passenger in an Uber when he got sick at around 4 a.m. Sunday. The driver, Jeffrey Monroe, pulled over in the westbound lanes of I-70 near Holt Road to help him. Both men were outside the car when a black Ford F-150 drove into the shoulder and struck the vehicle. Jackson and Monroe were pronounced dead at the scene.\nOrrego-Savala, the suspected driver of the F-150, first fled the scene on foot, according to the probable cause document. Indiana State Police troopers located him on the ramp to Holt Road and stopped him, at which point he reportedly admitted he was the driver of the truck. A portable breath test administered at the scene determined Orrego-Savala\u2019s BAC to be 0.239 percent \u2013 three times the legal limit.\nTuesday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted about Edwin Jackson's death, calling it \"disgraceful.\""}

While many observers anticipated the move, it is nonetheless remarkable given the shared history of the two states, increased tensions between the United States (South Korea's number-one military partner) and the North and the outstanding fact that a state of conflict still exists officially between the two Koreas.\nAs well, the nations have committed to fielding at least one combined team for the first time \u2014 women's ice hockey \u2014 and may be developing more joined efforts. Currently, the plan is for their skiing teams to train together. While both Koreas aim to have 550 North Korean athletes compete, only a single pairs figure skating team is confirmed to appear at the moment. As of now, it appears the states will use a flag depicting the Korean peninsula at the opening ceremony, which at least some of their athletes used in the 2004 and 20o6 games (they also marched together in the 2007 Asian Winter Games).\nNews of the agreement arrived via South Korea's Unification Ministry, which said that concentrated talks in the Demilitarized Zone resulted in the compact. The move still has to be approved by the International Olympic Committee, the organization which oversees the games.\nAs noted, the agreement can be seen as a diplomatic breakthrough. While an armistice between the two nations was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953, technically a state of conflict still exists between them, one that has been marked by both efforts towards rapprochement and aggression. In 2013, for instance, the North removed itself from the armistice in response to increased United Nations sanctions. Three years later, it was requesting peace talks brokered by the United States.\nThe last few months have been a particularly curious time in the relationship between the North and the South. While North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continues to rattle his saber by threatening nuclear war, launching missile and warhead tests, and sparring with U.S. President Donald Trump over Twitter, he's also been conciliatory toward his rivals in the South, saying he wished for a \"peaceful resolution of the Southern border\" in his annual New Year address. In that same speech, he congratulated South Korea on its upcoming hosting of the Olympics.\nInsofar as the U.S. is concerned, the situation with North Korea is almost as confused. Yes, through their leaders the two nations spar in words, each threatening to unleash nuclear weapons upon the other. Yet, through their diplomats, there seems to be at least a willingness to negotiate. Still, the tension between the two was marked by a false missile alert in Hawaii over the weekend.\nSport has periodically been a playing field where North and South Korea have achieved something like harmony. In international competition, North Koreans have often cheered for the South Korean soccer teams and vice versa \u2014 except, of course, when they play against each other."}

What lessons do you derive from your experience of negotiating with Israel?\nMarwan Muasher: This was a totally different time. There was some hope that there would be an end to the Occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Israeli government at the time was at least willing to engage. In retrospect it was not clear whether they ever wanted a Palestinian state. Certainly [Yitzak] Rabin never said that explicitly. But there was hope that the Oslo process would at least lead to an end of the occupation.\nToday, that hope has totally evaporated. If you ask Jordanians today, I doubt there is more than one per cent that would favour dealing with this. The atmosphere has been poisoned for many reasons. In my time, the number of settlers in the West Bank and Gaza was 250,000. A major shortcoming of the Oslo process was that it did not insist on a settlement freeze until you negotiate a final status agreement.\nToday, the number of settlers is 650,000 in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Even if the political will exists, and I do not think it does, there is no way to implement a two-state solution.\nThere are 250,000 settlers in East Jerusalem alone. So in my view, the two-state solution is dead. Some people will say it never lived, but it is certainly dead today.\nMEE: Do you feel betrayed?\nMM: It\u2019s not personal. I think the Arabs did their best to find a political solution and it did not stop at the Oslo process. We came up with lots of initiatives including the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, which attempted to find a regional solution that would make an Israeli agreement possible.\nBut of course the Israelis did not play along, neither did the Americans. The [George W] Bush administration paid lip-service to the peace process. So we did our best, but it is time to acknowledge that the old paradigm is over. No amount of negotiations today are going to reach a two-state solution, because one of the parties does not want it, the Israeli party, and the sponsor of such talks is now totally biased towards the Israelis.\nUnder these conditions, you can no longer cling onto an old model.\nMEE: What is the effect of Trump's move of the US embassy to Jerusalem?\nMM: Legally, it\u2019s worth nothing. Just because the US wants to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel does not mean it becomes so under international law. All international resolutions are clear on this point. But of course, from a moral point of view, you have the biggest superpower in the world attempting to take Jerusalem off the negotiating table, frankly in an extremely naive manner. To suggest that you can take Jerusalem off the table and expect anyone from the Palestinian side to still negotiate an agreement is pure fantasy. It\u2019s not going to happen. There is no Palestinian leader in the world today who can agree to such a settlement.\nMEE: You bring a Jordanian Christian perspective to this.\nMM: Jerusalem is important to every Muslim, every Arab and when I say Arab, I mean Christians as well as Muslims. The number of Christians in Jerusalem today is less than 4,000 people, which means we might face a situation in a generation's time when Christian holy places become museums where nobody lives and that'"}
{"idx": "28941", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Labor Department announced on Friday that employment growth fell sharply in March, gaining a hundred and twenty-six thousand jobs, following a year in which the average growth was two hundred and sixty-nine thousand jobs per month. This news shouldn\u2019t have come as surprise. In much of the country, it was an extremely cold winter\u2014colder even than last year, when, for three months in a row, the payroll figure fell below two hundred thousand. A series of other economic indicators, such as retail sales and orders for durable goods, have also come in weak recently, indicating that the economy is stuttering. On Wall Street, some forecasters have reduced their estimates for first-quarter G.D.P. growth to 1.5 per cent, or even less.\nThat\u2019s not very encouraging, but nor is it something we haven\u2019t seen before. Weak first quarters have become a pattern. Since 2010, economists at Goldman Sachs point out, G.D.P. growth has averaged 0.6 per cent in Q1 and 2.9 per cent the rest of the year. If a similar pattern holds this year, and there isn\u2019t any obvious reason why it shouldn\u2019t, we will see a rise in job creation and G.D.P. growth in the coming months.\nBut can we expect healthy growth in jobs and incomes to become the norm? In a series of blog posts earlier this week, Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, presented the optimistic view, arguing that many of the \u201cheadwinds\u201d that have been holding the economy back in the past five years, such as the housing bust, problems in the banking sector, and restrictive fiscal policy, are now receding. That has been the view of Bernanke\u2019s successor, Janet Yellen, too, and it explains why the Fed has been talking about starting to raise interest rates.\nI\u2019ve written before that I\u2019m sympathetic to Summers\u2019s argument, which he had the misfortune of expounding just as the U.S. economy was starting to accelerate. Now that the economy is slowing down again, at least temporarily, he perhaps deserves another hearing, especially for his point that low growth can become self-sustaining. If you look at the job figures and some productivity figures that the government released earlier in the week, there are clear signs that this is happening.\nOne of the most important figures in the monthly job report\u2014and here I am again repeating myself\u2014is the labor-force participation rate, which is the proportion of non-institutionalized sixteen-to-sixty-five-year-olds who are working or looking for work. During and after a recession, the participation rate always falls: people lose their jobs and get too discouraged to fill out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Some retire early, some go on disability, some drift into limbo. In any case, they aren\u2019t available to work. From the perspectives of the individuals involved, the process often involves hardship and frustration; from an economy-wide vantage point, valuable human resources are wasted.\nIn theory, the participation rate should pick up as the economy starts growing again and people become more optimistic. But this time it hasn\u2019t happened. Almost six years after the recession officially ended, the participation rate sits at 62.7 per cent, which ties the lowest rate since the late nineteen-seventies, when far fewer women went out to work. Although some of the decline is probably due to secular factors, particularly the aging of baby boomers, there is no doubt that slow economic growth and a perceived lack of job opportunities have also played a big part in the process"}

And if you're bitten by a lone star tick, you could develop a food allergy. This problem is spreading as the tick's range expands. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports.\nALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: One day last summer, Laura Stirling took her dog Gunner for a walk on a trail near her house. She lives in Severna Park, Md. Later that evening, she realized she'd bitten by a tick.\nLAURA STIRLING: I found it 3 or 4 inches to the left of my hip bone and didn't think anything of it. I just took it off and threw it away.\nAUBREY: But about three weeks later, she ate an Italian-style pork sausage for dinner and had a horrible reaction.\nSTIRLING: I would say it was probably six hours after I ate it. It was in the middle of the night. And I woke up covered in hives.\nAUBREY: She was itching and scratching. She felt lightheaded. She also noticed stomach aches. So she went to see an allergist.\nSTIRLING: He asked me, did you change your detergent? Did you change anything in your diet? And I said no. And he said, in the last month, were you bitten by a tick? And I said yes.\nAUBREY: After a blood test, the allergist told her she was allergic to red meat and maybe dairy, too.\nSTIRLING: I thought it was completely crazy because I've eaten dairy and I've eaten red meat all my life.\nSCOTT COMMINS: We're confident that the number is over 5,000 at least in the U.S. alone.\nAUBREY: There are also cases in Sweden, Germany and Australia likely linked to other species of ticks. Now, Commins says in the U.S., cases have moved beyond the southeast to New York, Maine and Minnesota.\nCOMMINS: Absolutely we're going to find that this continues to expand. The reach of the tick is expanding. And equally, I think, we have a blood test, we're raising awareness, and the word is getting out.\nAUBREY: There's still a lot to learn about this allergy. It's known as an alpha-gal allergy. Alpha-gal's a sugar that animals make, including cows and pigs, but we don't.\nCOMMINS: As humans, we don't make this alpha-gal sugar. We all make an immune response to it.\nAUBREY: So how does a tick bite cause the allergy? Well, it's possible that ticks inject alpha-gal into people's bodies when they bite. The ticks likely get it from feeding off wild animals such as mice or squirrels. Commins says it's also possible that ticks activate the response in another way.\nCOMMINS: Whatever the tick is doing, it seems that it's a very potent awakener for our immune system to produce antibodies. And in this case, it is antibodies to a very particular sugar in red meat.\nAUBREY: As for Laura Stirling, she now avoids all dairy and all red meat.\nSTIRLING: Once I was told just stop eating it, I was fine.

The cloud computing specialist delivered outstanding revenue growth thanks to a spike in customer additions and transaction size, posting a lower-than-expected net loss.\nThe company's current-quarter revenue guidance also turned out to be better than expected, allaying investors' worries regarding potential market-share concession to the likes of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Cisco. So what led to Nutanix's terrific growth last quarter, and is it capable of sustaining its momentum? To find out, let's take a look at three key points from Nutanix management.\nNutanix added 875 new customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, ending the year with 7,051 clients, up from 3,768 customers at the end of the prior year. That's an 87% increase. What's important to note is that the company is getting more and more repeat orders from its existing clients.\nIn fact, 70% of Nutanix's bookings last quarter were from existing customers as compared to 64% in the year-ago quarter. And the company has been focusing on larger deals. For instance, a quarter of Nutanix's billings in the fourth quarter came from its top 25 customers, with the number of $1 million-plus deals increasing 39% year over year.\nAdditionally, there are over 166 customers who have made purchases of more than $2 million from Nutanix.\nThis is good news for Nutanix investors as higher repeat orders reduce the amount spent by the company on customer acquisition. This was clearly evident last quarter as it spent 58.6% of its revenue on sales and marketing, down from 62.9% in the year-ago quarter.\nLooking ahead, Nutanix believes that it can get more business from its large clients. CEO Dheeraj Pandey said, \"... we feel very good about our large customers becoming even larger, and many of them are now interested in software agreements with us in fiscal 2018.\"\nNutanix's software-related bookings jumped 96% year over year last quarter. The company generated 17% of its $289.2 million worth of bookings from the software side of the business. The growth in this segment has allowed Nutanix to make up for the margin erosion that it has witnessed due to an increase in DRAM prices.\nNutanix anticipates its gross margin to remain flat this quarter despite a 10% projected increase in DRAM costs, thanks to a higher mix of software sales. The company believes that its recently launched multi-cloud management software -- Nutanix Calm -- will play a key role in pushing stronger sales.\nNutanix Calm targets the hyper-converged cloud environment where enterprises can run applications on both public and private cloud infrastructures. The platform will allow enterprise customers to separate cloud application management from the related infrastructure, enabling hyper-convergence.\nThe company has already made some progress in this space by partnering with the Google Cloud Platform, allowing users to manage applications in a hyper-converged environment. This could be a big deal for Nutanix as the hyper-converged cloud infrastructure market could be worth an estimated $8.5 billion in 2020.\nNut"}

It prepares us for his steep descent into the dark areas of New York City\u2019s criminal underworld. Lucky\u2019s only way out becomes straight through.\nThe steps down come rapidly, but not without authenticity.

Lucky becomes the one honest man on all these women\u2019s paths and he lives up to that role without fail to his own detriment.\nThe film becomes his journey to salvation and redemption from a snap, greedy decision that unwittingly pulled these women into an orbit where a bullet between the eyes seems the only way out.

The new version is more user friendly, he said.\n\"There's been interest already,\" said Frederick. \"I think, as people start seeing it out there being used and understand the advantages it has, it'll do pretty well.\"\nPart of the appeal of the iPark is its simplicity, as well as convenience, Frederick said. The iPark user uses a button pad to select the proper parking time limit for the space; presses the start button, displaying a digital clock that counts down the time remaining; and places the device on the dashboard. Users push a button to end the session and they are charged only for the time used.\nParking time may be purchased in $25, $50 or $100 increments, including a service charge, which is $2.50 for $25, $3.50 for $50 and $5 for $100.\nA number of iPark functions can be performed online using the iPark link from the city Web site, including the purchase of parking funds, receiving a code to reload the purchased amount onto the iPark device, checking transaction history and viewing locations for on-street parking.

The Wolcott youth rebuilt the entry as part of his Eagle Scout effort.\nLukas Burner has been a Boy Scout for about seven years now, so it was only natural that the Wolcott youth set his sights on the organization\u2019s highest honor.\nNow visitors to the Eagle County Historical Society Museum at Chambers Park are benefitting from Burner\u2019s Eagle Scout aspirations.\nAs part of the process to become an Eagle Scout, youths must complete a community service project.

His father, a local architect and contractor, assisted and various local business and organizations contributed money for the materials.\nThe completed project marks the end of a busy spring for Burner. He graduated from Vail Christian High School in May and plans to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder this fall to study management and entrepreneurship.\nWith his Eagle Scout labor now done, Burner will have to submit a final report but he has until fall \u2014 his 18th birthday is Sept. 15 \u2014 to finish up the process."}

Another advantage to getting all those senses involved is the brain is at least doing something else and not focusing on being bored.\nThere\u2019s nothing worse for the Adult ADHD brain than focusing on how bored you are. There is second method that I use, and that is to set a self-imposed deadline. Often people with Adult ADHD say they work best \"under pressure\" when they have a deadline--and some people with Adult ADHD even say they can't get anything done at all if they don't have a deadline. What happens to Adult ADHD people in that case is, they perform well at work (where deadlines are imposed) but things fall apart at home.\nSo here's the other trick I've learned, using an egg timer. See if you can do this. Make it like a game. \"Hey, let\u2019s see if I can get through this pile in 15 minutes. I'll set a timer\" This is one of the best tricks for us people with Adult ADHD.\nI have two egg timers around my house and I use them all the time. I test myself. \"Let\u2019s see if I can file this pile of paper in 10 minutes.\" I set the timer and go. Now, we've just invoked the real kicker: to focus. It works like a charm.\nSo, you're kicking it into high gear, working on mea-speed, and most of the time it works, but what if...you don't finish it in 10 minutes? Then what?\nWell, then I look at that and say, \"Do I want to go for another 10, or do I want to do this later?\" That\u2019s what I do.\nEither way, I got a whole bunch done in 10 minutes that wouldn't have been done otherwise. That brings me to one more thing people with Adult ADHD will benefit from doing. We're so forward thinking that we're always onto the next thing, and the next thing. Those with Adult ADHD tend not to look at what they do accomplish and feel good about it.\nIf you take a moment to say, \"Look what I just did in 10 minutes,\" and actually reflect on, \"Hey, I got something done,\" versus going through to the next thing immediately, you'll feel a lot more motivation on a continuing basis.\nIf you'd like to get more great tips for how to focus with Adult ADHD, using common things you find in your everyday environment, see below!\nTellman Knudson is certified in Hypnotherapy and Neurolinguistic Programming.

{"idx": "28970", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Over the past few years I have written so on many different health and fitness subjects it really becomes challenging to find points of interest for such a wide audience. I am a big fan of yoga and the fact that I lack flexibility and still manage to get my morning dose of Ashtanga yoga in is no small thing. My morning ritual is a great way to stretch, strengthen and find balance before I start my day.\nRecently I have become interested in Tai Chi, yet another way to jump start my day other than yoga.\nLike Yoga, Tai Chi can build flexibility, strengthen your body and help you practice mindfulness. Tai Chi is an amazing activity that brings both health, fitness and mindfulness to your body with simple flowing movements. These movements have been used as an ancient wellness practice for more than 600 years. Tai Chi incorporates physical exercise to align and support your bodies natural energy. Most people think of Tai Chi only in terms of martial arts training for fighting or defense. In fact the contemplative practice of Tai Chi is practiced more as a part of traditional Chinese health and medicine than a method of hand-to-hand combat. The slow rhythmic movements of Tai Chi stimulates and aligns the body's natural energy. These structured movements form a supportive flow around posture, balance and strengthens mobility. The other positive aspect of Tai Chi is its ability to stretch muscles and create flexibility for your joints, spine and connective tissue.\nTai Chi is also an effective way to alleviate stress and anxiety. There are a number of styles or schools of Tai Chi and it is considered \"meditation in motion\" which is calming and promotes a strong feeling of inner peace.\nThere are many styles or schools of Tai Chi each having their own separate methods and practices behind them. With names like tang-style or sun-style these practices are considered to be safe for people of all ages since the movements do not put undue stress on your muscles and joints. The movements are also slow and measured so it does not stress the cardiovascular system. The other very nice thing about Tai Chi is like yoga it simply takes a little space and does not require sports gear or specialized machines to be able to workout.\nIn many cities around the country and even here locally it is not uncommon to see one or more people in a quiet area of a park practicing those slow well designed movements. It can be done in groups or by yourself and best of all it does not take a great deal of time to practice.\nAn older form of Tai Chi is a discipline that is not as well-known in the west, called Qigong. Qigong is a somewhat less structured method of \"moving meditation\" that uses the same type of rhythmic movements to focus posture, breathing and center your mind. There have been many studies done regarding the overall health benefits associated with Tai Chi and Qigong. In particular the movement exercises improve balance, joint function and overall stability in older adults which can help with mobility and prevent falls.\nMany health and fitness professionals have incorporated Tai Chi and Qigong into their sport medicine, physical therapy and mainstream medical treatment practices. The New England Journal of Medicine for example did a study that showed patients with Parkinson's disease that practiced Tai Chi showed improvement with their mobility.\nLearning and practicing either Tai Chi or Qigong is pretty straight forward. There are a number of martial arts schools that offer face-to-face instruction, or you can self teach by watching YouTube videos or following book instructions. The simplicity of Tai Chi or Qigong makes them fairly easy to grasp and start practicing. The main thing here is our bodies are made to move and doing any form of exercise is key to better health and your fitness."}

Hampton Inn. They\u2019re all brands underneath the Hilton hotel umbrella. And soon, their rooms will unlock via your iPhone or Android device.\nStarting this year, 4,000 Hilton hotels worldwide will allow you to check in and out, and even upgrade your room, via an app\u2013meaning the only time you have to go to the front desk and see a human is to get your key. And in 2015, Hilton will unroll the option to unlock your room\u2019s door with your phone (presumably, via Bluetooth), removing any lingering reason you might have to communicate with a flesh and blood member of the hotel staff, beyond, maybe, getting more towels.\nA great hotel is about more than the room.\nKeyless hotels are on trend, as Starwood\u2019s Aloft recently launched a similar pilot program at a few locations. And no doubt, for anyone who has traveled at strange hours, or waited in a particularly long line to check into their reserved room, the appification of the hotel experience may seem to be a godsend. But a great hotel\u2013even a great hotel you get on a budget\u2013is about more than the room. It\u2019s a carefully crafted experience, from the room right down to the human touches: the smile at check-in, the helpfulness of a concierge, the offering of a piece of fruit, glass of wine, or a cookie.\nI\u2019ll never forget checking into Shibuya\u2019s beloved Cerulean Tower, and being offered a hot, damp towel\u2013a simple luxury you get at many Japanese restaurants, sure\u2013but the perfect little antidote to spending a day and a half on planes and buses. I remember that cheap steamed towel I was handed just as fondly as my room\u2019s panoramic views, the robo-toilet, and the hotel bar\u2019s discreet, off-the-menu bottle service.\nYes, we can automate a lot of the hospitality industry. But do we want to? Hilton, and all the other hotel companies with an eye on automation, need to proceed carefully. They\u2019ll need to resist the urge to use these phone check-in services to save money on staff. Instead, they should reassign their existing worker pool, now less encumbered by day-to-day logistics, and create more of those human-centric \u201ctowel\u201d experiences. Because if I have the convenience of keyless entry and a hotel staff that\u2019s suddenly worried about my needs beyond my keys, I have a truly great hotel experience."}

Although it now is owned by CMP Media LLC, the briefings have remained a quirky and iconoclastic venue for presenting hands-on research on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.\nApparently, it is a bit too iconoclastic for some tastes. At the Black Hat Briefings in Las Vegas in 2005, Cisco Systems Inc. threatened a lawsuit to stop a presentation on a vulnerability in its operating system. The talk was unexpectedly given anyway, and the FBI eventually got involved before the incident died.\nThen, at the Black Hat Federal Briefings outside of Washington in February, access card manufacturer HID Global Corp. of Irvine, Calif., made threatening noises to IOActive when researchers planned to demonstrate how RFID chips in the cards could be cloned.\nHID says it did not actually threaten IOActive, only made them aware that the presentation violated an HID patent. But IOActive felt threatened and said it could not afford the risk. The talk was cancelled.\nBlack Hat director Jeff Moss was disappointed, but said the decision was up to the presenter.\n\"If they want to pull the talk so they don't get sued, we'll support them,\" he said. \"If they want to fight, we'll support them.\"\nMoss worried later that the incident could have a chilling effect on security research, especially in smaller organizations without the resources to fight legal battles.\n\"This stuff makes me nervous,\" he said. \"I don't want to get to the point where the only spokesmen we can get are from IBM or Microsoft, companies with big legal teams. It's a subtle reduction of public information.\"\nHe said companies that feel threatened should be less heavy-handed and more willing to work with researchers who uncover problems.\n\"It's not like the problem goes away if you shut up the researcher,\" Moss said.\nIt would be easy to trot out the standard complaints about a litigious society and to blame the lawyers for these incidents. But it is not the lawyers who are at fault here; these confrontations are the result of a lack of corporate leadership.\nLawyers are paid to give advice, and if they do not present their clients with the worst- case scenario and advise them to avoid it, they are not doing their jobs. But corporate officers are not obligated to take that advice. Often it makes better sense to take a broader view of a situation, acknowledge problems and make lemonade out of the lemons being gathered by researchers.\nThis battle already has been fought once, over the issue of vulnerability disclosures. Industry and the research community have come to an agreement on a responsible way to inform the public about software vulnerabilities in a timely manner, while at the same time giving vendors an opportunity to patch the problems. The same kind of understanding is needed on presentations of research in public venues so that the threat of lawsuits and last-minute cancellations do not throw cold water on those who, for fun or for profit, poke at our IT systems looking for holes.\nThis would benefit not only conference organizers such as"}

However, he repeated the warning by the administration that all options remained on the table.\nPence arrived in Seoul only hours after the most recent ballistic missile launch by North Korea.

Maybe you should buy financials like Wells Fargo as a play on the continued economic recovery, or oil companies like ExxonMobil while prices remain depressed. Or maybe your money should be used to buy high-quality blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola or Procter and Gamble. Maybe you&apos;re worried about a correction and should buy stocks that tend to do well in bad times, like Wal-Mart.\nBetter yet, why not make the decision easy and invest in a company that owns all of the above and more? Enter Berkshire Hathaway . Buying shares of Berkshire is like buying a rock-solid stock portfolio and some great businesses all at once. Here&apos;s why Berkshire Hathaway deserves serious consideration for any well-rounded portfolio.\nWhy Berkshire?Basically, Berkshire Hathaway is a great company because its business model and management are without equal.\nBerkshire&apos;s primary business is insurance, which it conducts through wholly owned subsidiaries such as Geico. Then, using some of the money collected as insurance premiums, Berkshire invests in other businesses or buys stock in publicly traded companies that management thinks will deliver maximum returns to shareholders.\nAs far as management goes, I can&apos;t think of anyone off the top of my head whom I&apos;d trust with my money more than Warren Buffett. And for those concerned about Buffett&apos;s age, know that his top two stock-pickers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are rock stars. Their picks have been beating the market handily, and Buffett himself has said, \"They have made Berkshire billions already that we wouldn&apos;t have otherwise made.\"\nA great investment portfolio all in one stockWhen investing in Berkshire Hathaway, you aren&apos;t just buying shares in one business. You&apos;re buying an entire portfolio of companies and stocks that were hand-picked by the best minds in investing. Berkshire is the only way to get a piece of great companies such as Geico, The Pampered Chef, NetJets, and Duracell, to name just a few. In total, Berkshire has about 55 subsidiary companies, many of them well-known national businesses.\nAnd the company&apos;s common-stock portfolio includes some of the most dominant companies in America. Just look at some of the stocks it owns. Does this not look like a top-notch collection of dividend stocks that any investor would be happy to own?\nThe performance speaks for itselfPerhaps the best thing about investing in Berkshire is that it&apos;s a defensive stock that delivers market-crushing performance over the long run.\nDon&apos;t be discouraged that Berkshire tends to underperform the S&P in years when the market is exceptionally strong. Buffett realizes that it&apos;s not about the good years. In fact, Berkshire has underperformed the S&P in four out of the past five years.\nWhat makes the biggest difference in long-term performance is how a company does when the market is struggling, and the main reason is that it&apos;s tougher to overcome a loss than it is to erase a big gain. Consider that a stock that loses 33% needs to gain 50% just to get back to breakeven, so when you avoid big losses, you don&apos;t have to worry as much about outperforming every year.\nAnd Berkshire specializes in holding on to its money"}

From the fourteenth century discovery of the Holy Shroud in France, the image venerated in the West was that of the Sorrowful Face. Then, as seen above, Pope John Paul II extended the veneration of the Holy Face to every stage of life, such as in his encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia, introducing the veneration of the Eucharistic Face of Jesus.\nImages of God were forbidden in the Old Testament because they would be designed and made by man according to his imagination. It seems that God had the people \u201cseek his face\u201d in preparation for the revelation of that Face in Christ. Colossians 1:15 declares, \u201cChrist is the image (icon) of the invisible God\u201d \u2013 an icon of God given by God, being the true image of God.\nThe New Testament opens with the annunciation of St. John the Baptist, whose father prophesies, \u201cThou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\u201d (Luke 1:76). All of the Synoptic Gospels include the Transfiguration of Jesus. It is Matthew in 17:2 that emphasizes his face: \u201cAnd he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light.\u201d In 2 Corinthians 4:6, St. Paul directs our attention to the face of Jesus: \u201cFor it is the God who said, \u2018Let light shine out of darkness,\u2019 who has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.\u201d Revelation 22:3-4 proclaims its eternal joyful contemplation in heaven \u201c\u2026 the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; they shall see his face\u2026\u201d. We see that devotion to the Holy Face of God in the Old Testament prepared for its realization in the Holy Face of Jesus in the New Testament. This devotion will be expressed in various ways in the history of the Church.\nA tradition from apostolic times tells the story of an image of the Holy Face of Christ \u201cnot made by human hands.\u201d Claimed to have been made by Jesus"}

In it, she highlighted the many issues facing her country under the current military-led government, and the need for Obama to take a stand for human rights and democracy if his administration wishes to count its support for an opening Burma as a genuine \u201cforeign policy success\u201d.\n\u201cThis is President Obama\u2019s chance to acknowledge that the situation in Burma has regressed since his last visit and to tell the people of Burma that the US will stand with them for human rights and democracy with concrete actions that reflect the challenges facing Burma\u2019s reform process,\u201d Khin Ohmar wrote.\nWhile this is indeed an important message, and Obama\u2019s influence on the generals and former generals that continue to rule Myanmar is arguably greater than any other individual\u2019s in the democratic world, it is our enduring shame as a region that there has been barely a whimper of a voice regarding ASEAN\u2019s own responsibility to halt the tide of genocide rising within our borders. We have a responsibility under international law to protect all human beings from genocide \u2013 a responsibility each and every ASEAN leader is failing to live up to.\nWhy has there been no call for action from ASEAN leaders on the Rohingya? Perhaps that is because our \u201cassociation\u201d of nations is seen as ineffectual and centered around power and wealth only \u2013 void of any genuine ability or desire to progress human rights in our region.\nIt hasn\u2019t been that long since we last saw people slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands in our region. Less than 40 years ago, just one generation back, at least 1.7 million people \u2013 nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population \u2013 were killed by execution, disease, starvation and overwork under the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule from 1975 to 1979.\nWe must make sure something like this can never happens again. But a quote from a Thai police officer in a Reuters article this week sums up the failures of the ASEAN project and how far we have to go before we become anything close to a \u201ccommunity.\u201d A Thai district police chief was quoted as saying that hundreds of boat people that had turned up in Thai waters after fleeing persecution in Myanmar were not Thailand\u2019s responsibility.\n\u201cThey are Muslims from Myanmar \u2026 They are illegal migrants,\u201d Police Colonel Sanya Prakobphol, head of Kapoe district police told Reuters.\nBut they are Thailand\u2019s responsibility, Thailand\u2019s \u201cproblem\".

Also, a full-time pulmonologist and trained nursing staff are being deployed in view of the worsening air condition,\u201d said a senior official of Max Vaishali.\nAt Apollo Hospital, the doctors said its emergency division will be fully functional. \u201cSome of the doctors are always on call. In case there is high influx of patients with respiratory illness, more doctors will be called in,\u201d said Dr Priyadarshini Pal Singh, who heads the emergency department at Apollo Hospital.\nAccording to the doctors, those suffering from pre-existing illnesses such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at risk of exacerbation of symptoms on direct exposure to heavy pollution.\n\u201cThey should remain indoors, at least away from the place where firecrackers are being burst,\u201d said a doctor. The burning of fireworks releases a large amount of air pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter along with several metal salts, for example aluminium, manganese and cadmium.\n\u201cThis year, the Supreme Court has imposed certain restrictions on bursting of fireworks so we are hoping there would be lesser number of burn patients. But we are ready to deal with any emergency situation. The other departments are also all geared up to tackle the rush of patients on or after Diwali,\u201d Dr P S Bhandari, nodal officer for burn care at Lok Nayak hospital, said.\nIn the past week, due to increased pollution, many hospitals have postponed elective surgeries on elderly and children with a history of respiratory illness. This is because an acute attack of respiratory condition, say asthma or chronic bronchitis, can lead to fatal consequences, say doctors."}
