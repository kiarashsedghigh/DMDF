The pastoral comedy is perhaps known as much for the famed soliloquy \"All the World's a Stage\" or \"The Seven Ages of Man\" as for its storyline.\nIn the play, a duke's court is usurped by his brother and he and his followers flee to the nearby forest. There, his supporters -- including his jester, other courtiers, his daughter Rosalind and her friends -- camp out among the country folk and make do with their banishment.\nIn hiding, Rosalind has adopted the visage of a young man, and a new name, Ganymede, and this new appearance leads to a comedy of mistaken identities as a country girl falls for her.\n\"The show has a little bit of everything: comedy, love and romance, mistaken identity, and even chase scenes.

{"idx": "8006", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Moving to London from Australia in the winter of 2000-01, it took me about three minutes to work out that the liveliest, most authoritative art critic working for British newspapers was an American. His name was Richard Dorment.\n\u201cExhibitionist,\u201d a collection of Dorment\u2019s best reviews (with beautiful photographs of the works accompanying every review), is scheduled to be published in September by Wilmington Square Books. And for me \u2014 who reached out to Dorment for advice in those early days and two years later began reviewing as a freelancer for the same newspaper \u2014 reading an advance copy of the book is not just a trigger to personal nostalgia, it\u2019s a vindication: Oh yes! it reminds me, I chose a great line of work.\nLondon\u2019s thriving newspaper culture meant that Dorment had plenty of competition. Each of the five daily broadsheets had multiple art critics. There was also the Evening Standard, with its pontificating, pugilistic, and at times hilariously self-parodying critic Brian Sewell.\nThe other critics each had strengths and weaknesses. But Dorment was the only one whose prose went straight to the point, who never hedged, and who was not only useful but invigorating to read. He seemed to express, better than all his colleagues, the excitement of what was going on in London just then.\nWhich was a lot. When Dorment began his almost 30-year stint as chief critic at The Daily Telegraph in 1986, London\u2019s art world was insular and anemic. Already by the time I arrived 14 years later, the scene had changed dramatically.\nTate Modern had just been opened by the Queen; it received 5.25\u2009million visitors in its first year. The Young British Artists phenomenon, promoted by the artists themselves and by the advertising guru Charles Saatchi, was in full swing. Tate\u2019s visionary director, Nicholas Serota, did his utmost to place these British artists in a global context.\nLondon, meanwhile, was awash in foreign money. The first major auction devoted exclusively to contemporary art was held in London (not New York) in 1998. Commercial galleries such as White Cube flourished, and Frieze Art Fair was launched in 2003.\nEntrance fees were removed from major museums. A public that had barely existed for contemporary art crystallized and proceeded to expand exponentially according to some as yet unwritten mathematical equation whose terms included Britpop, Tony Blair, Tracey Emin, the Turner Prize, David Beckham, and Kate Moss.\nPublic curiosity about art was stoked by ambitious curators and directors \u2014 people like Serota, Neil MacGregor, and Norman Rosenthal \u2014 but also by the newspapers and weekly magazines, and by such critics as Dorment.\nThe Telegraph was Britain\u2019s biggest-selling broadsheet. In 1987, the first full year after Dorment joined, it sold 1,147,000 copies a day \u2014 almost three times as many as its nearest competitor, The Times. For an art critic, this was an incredible podium. But it came at a price, as Dorment explains in the book\u2019s engrossing introduction.\nThis put Dorment in an invidious position, because the Telegraph was the nation\u2019s most conservative broadsheet. His own tastes, as he openly admits, were \u201cfairly cautious.\u201d He had worked as a curator in the department of European paintings at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; he had written a bi"}
{"idx": "8007", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A lot of similarities can be drawn from comparing the early days of 2-D HD production and transmission to the current state of producing live events in three dimensions.\nIn September 1997 we saw the first HDTV broadcasts of a professional baseball game and later that year John Glenn\u2019s return to space. Both productions used early prototype HD cameras and terrestrial transmission systems that were successful albeit technically challenged.\nThis year saw the first live 3-D telecast of an NFL game captured in San Diego and transmitted to theaters in Boston, Los Angeles and New York. Once again the equipment used was prototype, and the broadcast suffered occasional hits that caused the picture to go dark.\nThe question on the minds of those interested in moving the format forward is: If it took about 10 years to bring HDTV in to consumers\u2019 home, will 3-D take just as long? There\u2019s the issue of cameras and production equipment being immature along with a lack of television sets that can display such 3-D signals. The same technology and market conditions existed in the late 1990s.\n\u201cWith the way technology is moving today and as the number of productions, both for feature films and television, continues to grow, we\u2019re hoping it does not take as long for 3-D to get to the home,\u201d said David Modell, chairman of 3ality Digital Systems. His company recently produced the first live transmission of a 3-D NFL football game to three theaters in the United States, and will do it again for the upcoming FedEx Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game between the University of Florida and University of Oklahoma. 3ality has also been involved with many of the milestone 3-D events in recent years, including a stunning U2 concert that saw widespread release in theaters.\nLike early HDTV, 3-D creates several challenges for the broadcast industry. Production companies are realizing that crews need to be re-educated about the nuisances of capturing an event and bringing it into consumers\u2019 homes in a way that feels familiar to programs that came before it.\nThere\u2019s the positioning of cameras. In most stadiums and large venues, the best camera positions have been taken by traditional HD cameras, leaving little room for 3-D cameras with their larger size. There\u2019s framing issues for camera operators; they have to hold focus longer and minimize panning shots. There are new approaches for directors and TDs in the production truck; they have to be careful to match shots and depth of field from one camera to the next, or viewers will become disoriented.\nFor their part, production companies are wrestling with how to produce a game with the same number of trucks, keeping cost to producers as low as possible. With early HD, two separate trucks were required to produce both the SD and HD broadcasts. Today, the industry has figured out how to capture events in HD then downconvert for SD audiences with a single truck. For the upcoming BCS Championship Game, veteran mobile production company Game Creek Video will send two HD trucks \u2014 one for the HD telecast and a second for 3-D. The HD broadcast on FOX will be watched by millions, while the 3-D telecast will be seen by an estimated 14,000 spread out across 82 digital cinema theaters.\nWith HDTV, we\u2019ve seen it happen before.\nThere's still a large learning curve for crews to figure out how best to capture a live sporting event in 3-D.\nBexel's BBSOne production trailer was modified especially for this event."}

Check it out below.\nWe are PUMPED for these movies coming in the new year! https://t.co/QAlmPVbvTk ????\nThat EW photo shows Gal Gadot's Diana Prince during what appears to be her major moment of truth at towards the beginning of Wonder Woman's story. Upon learning about the carnage of World War I from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, Diana takes it upon herself to steal the \"God Killer\" sword from the Themyscira armory and run off to the battlefields of Europe. It is in this moment that we see her truly become the Wonder Woman that we all know and love, and this decision will lead her to witness the worst of humanity with her own two eyes. The photo shows her wearing a beautiful, gold Amazonian suit, which (we're assuming) she will inevitably trade in for her more traditional battle garb.\nThe specific presence of the God Killer sword seems like a very telling aspect of the film's narrative. It's a weapon that has become iconic in the realm of DC lore for its ability to cause harm to even the toughest of beings, which in turn seems like a solid indication that Wonder Woman will face off against enemies far stronger than a simple human. After all, during the Doomsday fight in Batman V Superman, she mentions that she has killed things from other worlds; we will finally get to see that first-hand.\nIt's also worth noting that the sword depicted in this photo does not actually resemble the ones seen during the events of Dawn of Justice. With that in mind, we think that she will either return the God Killer to its rightful place in Themyscira or she will lose it in a major WWI battle. Slade Wilson a.k.a Deathstroke, has become legendary for his use of the iconic sword in DC comics, so we wouldn't be surprised if Joe Manganiello's version of the character eventually gets his hands on the weapon at some point in a future DCEU film.\nOnly time will tell how this scene will actually play out, but it's already clear that Wonder Woman looks like a beautifully shot and put-together movie.

Poe had seen the automaton in Richmond, Va., where it toured after Baltimore and where he was living at the time, and he published an article in the April 1836 edition of the Southern Literary Messenger explaining what he thought was the nature of the hoax: that there was a man concealed within the automaton\u2019s body.\n\u201cHe probably saw it as an opportunity to show off a little bit, to show how he could play detective and be a sort of investigative reporter,\u201d said Peeples.\nThe essay, \u201cMaelzel\u2019s Chess Player,\u201d provided 17 pieces of evidence and was praised by contemporary papers, according to a listing of reviews in \u201cThe Poe Log,\u201d a copy of which was provided to The Sun by local Poe scholar George Figgs.

But all of that is changing now with the rise of cooperative platforms that look to unite local cafes through mobile ordering and rewards programs.\nOne such mobile platform looking to unite independent coffee shops is based in Vancouver, BC.\nJoJo offers a technology platform that features a cooperative network of small businesses and a rewards program that encourages people to buy their brew locally.\n\u201cWe are creating a network of independent coffee shops where customers will be able to earn rewards on every single order, regardless of the cafe they place the order at, and redeem them at any of our partner locations,\u201d said Founder and CEO Vivek Zaveri.\nJoJo is far from being alone in creating an app and platform that allows users to order coffee online to skip the lines at pickup while incorporating a rewards program.

It\u2019s a struggle for any size business to get orders out on time even for the guests who are physically there in-house.\nSo, it was refreshing to hear that the JoJo team had interviewed cafe owners, baristas, and supervisors in focus groups, and found their concerns to be the same as mine.\n\u201cBased on their precise feedback, we have created a process that requires no operational change in their workflow whatsoever, but gives them the ability to acknowledge each order,\u201d assures Amreen Gill, product development manager at JoJo.\nThat way, customer expectations are set from the get-go, and customers get push notifications at every single step in the workflow from when the cafe receives the order to when the cafe acknowledges the order and finally when the barista starts working on the order.\nIf a cafe ever gets slammed during a rush, JoJo has a time-buffer feature that allows coffee shops to go offline until they are ready to start accepting mobile orders again.\nWith plans to expand into major cities in the US, JoJo\u2019s goal is to build a platform that is highly interactive for users and makes them want to keep coming back while establishing a network of independent coffee shops to rival the mega chains.\n\u201cThis is a highly concentrated market, and we believe that a loyalty component with a personal touch, is key to making JoJo successful,\u201d says Gill."}

A German MEP earned around \u20ac7000 a month, while a Hungarian earned less than \u20ac1000.\nThe new wage will create its own discrepancies however with some MEPs now earning more than their national heads of state - as will be the case with Bulgarian deputies and the country's president.\nThe new rules were agreed in 2005, after years of wrangling and stalling by euro-deputies, particularly within the centre-right and Socialist factions, the two largest groups.\nHowever, reflecting the struggle for agreement, the compromise says that re-elected deputies may opt to keep their old wage for the whole of their membership of the European Parliament.\nWhile the new wage does not see too much change for German deputies, it represents a significant wage cut for Italians. The difference would have to be made up by member states.\nAt the same time, they agreed to improve the expenses system whose loose rules allowed MEPs to claim travel expenses based on a flat rate, regardless of the actual cost of the voyage.\nWith the onset of cheap airlines and rock bottom prices, deputies were able spend less travelling from their constituency to Brussels or Strasbourg and thus gaining something of a windfall by being allowed to claim back a set rate.\nRe-imbursements will now be made on the basis of actual expenditure.\nMEPs have not helped themselves when it comes to their image however, often changing the rules only when pressure became too strong to withstand.\nIt was media exposure that led them to reform the rules to prevent hiring family members and to bring parliamentary assistants, who run the day-to-day life of deputies, onto a legal and fairer footing. These changes will also come into effect in July, although family members already in employment will be allowed to continue for the next term.\nThe moves followed a scandal created early last year by a leaked internal audit report \u2013 which deputies later voted not to make public - detailing how some MEPs abuse their monthly allowances for staff, including in some cases letting the money flow to fictitious or family-owned companies.\nAdditionally, the assistants were often paid a pittance and social benefit and tax rules were ignored.\nCritics of the system say there is still room for improvement. They note that the rules on collecting daily allowances (\u20ac298) should be tightened up so it is not possible to simply turn up in the morning to collect an allowance and then leave.\nThey also argue there is still not enough oversight of the money granted to MEPs for running their offices.

Why would Robert Dillman, the long-serving president of ESU who retired in 2012, a man esteemed in Monroe County for his moral probity and forceful leadership, allegedly put his legacy at risk?\nIn an attempt to answer this question, the Pocono Record submitted a Right-to-Know request in 2009 that led to a protracted legal battle and, finally, to the release of nearly 14,000 pages of East Stroudsburg University Foundation files.\nOur working theory was that, if the allegations were true, Dillman may have wanted to protect Sanders because Sanders was his chief fundraiser.\nAllegations against Sanders were surfacing at a sensitive time: the wrap-up of a fundraising campaign for ESU's Science and Technology Center, which was the linchpin of Dillman's legacy.\nIn March 2003, Dillman's dream hit a major roadblock. The Science and Technology Center, which would be the first new building to rise on the ESU campus in decades, was in trouble.\nFirst budgeted at $23 million, the project went through a redesign. The news was bad \u2014 a 35 percent increase, from $23 million to $31 million.\nWorse for ESU, the campus in East Stroudsburg had to cover all of that extra money.\nBottom line: In total, ESU had to raise $15.6 million.\nThat left two options: Scale back the project or come up with the extra cash.\nFor ESU, scaling back the size of the building was a non-starter.\n\u201cThere is a history here of downsizing buildings to fit budget allocations that we do not want to repeat,\u201d Rich Staneski, then-vice president of administration and operations, wrote in an email to PASSHE in 2003.\nESU proposed a work-around: The ESU Foundation could raise the $15.6 million \u2014 eventually.

{"idx": "8020", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Inequality has risen under Republicans and Democrats when they\u2019ve embraced neoliberalism.\nThe economy is stuck in a ditch, with even Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke voicing serious concerns about a double-dip recession. Despite this, the focus of economic policy debates in Washington is drifting dangerously away from fighting mass unemployment and Wall Street hyper-speculation in favor of cutting social spending to reduce the federal deficit. State and local governments throughout the country are imposing major cuts in healthcare, education and social services. This is while the official unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, but a more accurate measure would be close to 20 percent. Also, a high proportion of workers who have been rehired after having been laid off during the recession are taking big pay cuts.\nAll these trends will contribute to worsening the economy\u2019s long-term pattern of sharply rising inequality. Rising inequality, in turn, increases the difficulties of mounting a sustainable recovery. The logic is simple. When the overall amount of income produced in an economy is shared broadly, more people have money in their pockets to spend, which bolsters demand in the markets and encourages private businesses to invest more. This leads to expanding employment opportunities, which then strengthens market demand further. Conversely, when an excessive share of an economy\u2019s overall income is concentrated at the top, then more money gets channeled into the Wall Street casino. This sets the stage for the type of financial collapse we experienced in 2008-09.\nJust how severe has been the rise in inequality? For starters, the share of total personal income going to the richest 1 percent of earners more than doubled between the late 1950s and 2005, from 10.2 to 21.8 percent. Even more extraordinary, the share received by the richest one out of 1,000 households\u2014the top 0.1 percent\u2014more than tripled over this same period, from 3.2 to 10.9 percent.\nOf course, capitalist economies are not designed to create equality. They are designed to reward winners in marketplace competition and correspondingly punish losers. This is supposed to be the motor force that drives capitalist economies to produce ever more products and ever greater riches, even if it also generates inequality. But recognizing this central fact about capitalism in general does not explain why US capitalism circa 2010 is producing a much greater level of inequality than during the 1950s and \u201960s.\nThe recent book Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age, by distinguished Princeton political scientist Larry Bartels, provides important perspectives on the situation. It does so through the impressive evidence and arguments he assembles but equally through the single overarching consideration that he neglects, even while his data lead us right to this point.\nDebates have been raging for decades without resolution about the major causes of rising American inequality. Bartels boldly tosses almost all of this literature aside and offers instead his own simple explanation: that the Democratic Party overall supports greater equality and the Republican Party supports greater inequality. Bartels\u2019s broad explanation for the rise in inequality since the 1960s is thus that Republicans have dominated politics over that period, especially by maintaining control of the White House for most of that time.\nWith Obama in the White House for eighteen months now, and the Democrats holding big majorities in both Houses of Congress, Bartels\u2019s model would suggest that egalitarianism should be on the march. But this has not yet happened. Prospects for the future are at best"}

I joined Skyworks back in 2002 when we started our company. We rang the bell in the Nasdaq. I think we were a $4 stock and in the middle of the \"Can you hear me now?\" era. Fifteen years later, I was fortunate, under the guidance of Dave Aldrich, our exec chair, to be given the opportunity to be the CEO. I'm thrilled by the opportunities that the market presents to us today [and] our ability to capture share and drive mobile connectivity. A phenomenal opportunity. I'm really excited about it.\nKretzmann: And something that comes up in Skyworks' press releases and other presentations is the wireless networking revolution. Can you say a few words about what that is and why it's important?\nGriffin: That's religion to us. That is religion. If you think about this market today ... if you think about Facebook ... if you think about Amazon. In fact, the leading five S&P companies today (Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft) are all driven by mobile connectivity, mobile platforms, whether it's client or client to cloud.\nIf you think about all this and translate that to how it works from bits and bytes, all of that technology runs through mobile solutions invariably produced by Skyworks. So we underpin that tremendous new economy that we see -- a shift from bricks and mortar -- to kind of the clicks and clacks that you see on your keyboard. But it's very powerful and it's still early innings.\nKretzmann: And what would you say Skyworks does that your competitors can't do, or can't do effectively?\nGriffin: A great question. So having said all these great things about mobility and the revolution, it's very, very complex and challenging. Our customers are faced with increasing burdens to deliver these higher data rates with more efficient solutions, less consuming of battery.\nWhat we do well is craft individual solutions and configure these customer by customer. We integrate filtering technology, gallium arsenide semiconductors, [and] switches, and integrate these into unique systems that are perfect for each and every customer.\nKretzmann: And for investors who are new to this space, I think a common risk or question that comes up is how a semiconductor company, or a backend technology company, can do something so that they don't become commoditized?

With the proliferation of medical technologies and chemical substitutes for natural medicines, it is easy to forget that today\u2019s pharmacies are stocked with modern, synthesized versions of traditional plant medicines that were used around the world for centuries and even millennia. Additionally, many of our natural medicines have roots in indigenous medical wisdom.\nI have had the pleasure of working with indigenous communities in my country and see the wealth of traditional medical knowledge, as well as the wealth of traditional plant medicines at risk of being lost forever. Many of these cultures have relied on an oral tradition for passing information from generation to generation, and like the medicine itself, this traditional teaching method is also impacted by the modern world.\nWhile some indigenous cultures are resistant to sharing traditional medicine with the outside world, the Mats\u00e9s people of Brazil and Peru have taken the bold step of documenting their traditional medicine in a 500-page encyclopedia. In an attempt to lessen the risk of theft by outside researchers and corporations, the Amazonian tribe has written the encyclopedia in its traditional language.\nThis massive undertaking was a collaboration between the Mats\u00e9s and the conservation group Acat\u00e9. With offices in the United States and Peru, Acat\u00e9 works with the indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforest to protect and preserve this special part of the planet. Their projects extend beyond traditional medicine to include initiatives like permaculture and sustainable commerce.\nThe encyclopedia is a compilation of knowledge from five shamans and became a priority after one of the Mats\u00e9s\u2019 distinguished elder healers passed away before his knowledge could be conveyed to other healers in the community. In addition to being the first ever Amazonian tribe to record its traditional medicine system in writing, the Mats\u00e9s have built a stronger bridge connecting elders and youth in the community and creating a tool that helps young shamans train in the traditions passed down from more experienced healers.\nHerndon points out that the encyclopedia is presented from the worldview of the Mats\u00e9s shaman, not an interpretation of an outside agent. It also describes the role rainforest animals play in the natural history of the plants and the connection with diseases. The encyclopedia categorizes the disease or health condition as it is known by the Mats\u00e9s, an explanation of the symptoms and how the shaman can recognize them. It documents the cause, which plant medicines can help and how they are prepared, as well as any alternative therapies that have proven effective.\nThe Mats\u00e9s people have found a balance between their traditional oral communication and the demands of the modern world that can easily, if not intentionally extinguish traditional knowledge at an alarming rate. This balance that will ensure the Mats\u00e9s\u2019 medicinal knowledge remains accessible to future generations."}

According to officials at the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, the extradition request has already been lodged but it may take a long time.\nBout himself insists he should be tried in Thailand. One of the reasons for that, perhaps, is if convicted in Bangkok, Bout will face a maximum of up to 10 years in prison and $US 6,000 fine, whilst in the U.S. the sentence would be a lot more severe.\nMeantime, Bout\u2019s brother says he\u2019s being used as a scapegoat.\n\u201cThe same thing happened before the war in Afghanistan, the same thing happens before the war in Yugoslavia, and the same thing happen before the campaign in Iraq.

{"idx": "8035", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public\u2019s safety at risk. San Francisco\u2019s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\nThe narrative surrounding the charge of murder or manslaughter in the case is familiar: an illegal alien, who had been deported five times but returned to the United States a sixth time, with a record of seven felony arrests, is allowed to go free by San Francisco authorities even when they knew ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents asked to be notified so they could pick him up for deportation. Within a few months, said illegal immigrant finds a gun, mishandles it, sending a round off the pavement and into the back of a young girl who dies within hours.\nThe jury\u2019s verdict should be respected. They heard the evidence. They deliberated as a group. They heard \u2026 testimony. They looked at the physical evidence and they rendered a verdict to the best of their abilities in accordance with the law.\nThe challenge facing the prosecution was somewhat sizable: There was only circumstantial evidence upon which it could build a case. It had to prove that Zarate\u2019s killing of Steinle either was both willful and premeditated, or was the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought. For first-degree murder charges to stick, the prosecution had to prove to the jury \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that Zarate intended to kill Steinle. The Legal Dictionary defines that term as such \u201cthat no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty.\u201d The only way Zarate could have been convicted was for the prosecution to be so persuasive that the jurors \u201chave no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts.\u201d The prosecution had to prove to the jurors, at the very least, that Zarate pulled the trigger of the gun. His pulling of the trigger in a public place, resulting in death, would have led to a negligent homicide conviction. The jury evidently believed that the gun went off accidentally, without Zarate pulling the trigger. In gun-familiar Montana or some other state where gun owners would recognize how unusual an accidental misfire would be with that type of gun, a jury might have convicted. In San Francisco, not.\nAfter six days of deliberation, they acquitted Zarate. All that is left is their ruling that he was a felon in possession of a gun, which demands a jail term of between 16 months and three years. ICE officials have said they will immediately deport Zarate for the sixth time once he has served that sentence.\nIt\u2019s helpful to remember that if immigration laws had been respected and enforced, Kate Steinle would most likely still be alive, and Zarate would never have been in the country, much less mishandling that firearm on San Francisco\u2019s Pier 4 on July 1, 2015. Kate may be deceased but her cause lives on.\nKey Issue in Steinle Trial: Was Shooter\u2019s Act Intentional or Accidental?"}

Investors are still making up their mind and the uncertainty is affecting the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock. The scrip fell 6% after the bank said in an exchange filing that it has filed a writ petition against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay high court to protect its interests. Kotak and the central bank haven\u2019t been seeing eye to eye on the methods available for a private sector bank to reduce promoter shareholding.\nEven though the deadline for meeting RBI\u2019s norms was around the corner, investors didn\u2019t seem too perturbed. Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s shares have outperformed the markets this fiscal year. Investors seem to have assumed that Kotak would manage a workaround or a compromise. After all, there have been multiple similar deadlines in the past, and they were successfully navigated. But this time is evidently different.\nFor backdrop, RBI rules state that promoter shareholding in Kotak Mahindra Bank has to be brought down to 20% by the end of December this year and 15% by March 2020. It currently stands at a little over 30%.\nIn August, Kotak Mahindra Bank hit upon the route of issuing perpetual non-convertible preference shares to increase the paid-up capital, thereby diluting Kotak\u2019s stake in the bank. RBI shot down this idea and refused to consider this route as a valid one. This implied that only traditional methods such as a direct sale of shares by the promoters or a fresh equity issue to outside investors would be considered kosher by the central bank.\nBut Kotak has persisted, and has been trying to convince the regulator to give in. The filing of the writ petition shows that neither side is blinking.\nRBI\u2019s stance is not surprising. Just a few months ago, it pulled up Bandhan Bank Ltd for violating the deadline of diluting promoter ownership. Other banks have behaved like obedient children and strictly followed timelines. Considering the law is equal to all and regulation cannot be partisan, RBI seems to have stuck to its guns.\nThe contents of Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s petition are not known publicly yet, but analysts reckon it is mainly to challenge the exclusion of the preference share route for stake dilution. After all, Kotak\u2019s argument is that this route is allowed under The Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\nThe window for suing the regulator is thanks to some poor drafting by RBI\u2019s legal department. Under the rules, the promoter has to bring down stake with respect to paid-up capital, and not specifically equity capital. Kotak is just following the law to the letter, and has received a fair share of criticism for disregarding the spirit of the law.\nEvidently, this isn\u2019t something Kotak seems to be too worried about, having taken the letter of the law argument all the way to the courts. Having said that, the move is likely to buy the bank time, if it\u2019s successful in getting a stay granted by the courts. In a best-case scenario, the courts may agree with Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s argument.\nFor now, though, investors are left ruing the fact that uncertainty on the issue will linger, besides worrying about any likely fallout of taking on the regulator."}

Excess trash from large meals and even larger parties is an unfortunate holiday tradition for most. This makes winter composting a great, green project for those with the space, time, and the willingness to venture outside to tend to a big steaming heap of muck.\nI\u2019m not a composter myself but from what I've gathered, outdoor composting during the chilly months requires attention to detail, particularly to heat, fuel, and insulation. That said, a Southern Californian winter is different from one in Quebec, so it all really varies on your climate. And, of course, whether or not to start composting in the winter can also depend on your waste output. If you\u2019re generating a noticeable amount of organic waste material, then composting may be a good call.\nThe Compost Guy has posted a great primer on some of the ins and outs of winter composting with a video (below) tracking his successes (and missteps) trying to compost during cold Canadian winters. The accompanying soundtrack is a bit late night cable-esque but for basic info, this guy is a true wizard.\nAnd for newbies looking to learn more about composting in general, Compost This has a great list of what items you can and cannot compost.\nCity slickers looking to get in on some urban decay action are also in luck. Cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Seattle, and Philadelphia all offer home programs to educate compost-curious residents.

But the others have done nothing this year, even as sexual misconduct allegations against lawmakers have been mounting.\n\u201cIn the wake of Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement that swept across different industries, we had to act,\u201d said Democratic Assemblywoman Nily Rozic of New York, which mandated more robust sexual harassment policies for government agencies and private employers.\nBut \u201cI think we have a long ways to go in addressing sexual harassment in legislatures across the country,\u201d she said.\nSince the start of 2017, at least 30 state lawmakers have resigned or been kicked out of office following allegations of sexual misconduct, according to an AP tally. An additional 25 lawmakers have faced repercussions such as the loss of party or committee leadership positions since last year. Numerous others have had allegations brought against them.\nBut the experience ultimately left Tanzi frustrated.

As of August, the AP's follow-up survey found that about half of the 99 state legislative chambers actually had made changes. More than two dozen that previously indicated they were reviewing policies have yet to make any substantive changes, though some are still considering it.\n\u2022 The most common response among lawmakers has been to boost their own training about sexual harassment. About half the legislative chambers have done so, typically by making it mandatory or providing it more frequently. But legislative chambers in one-fifth of the states still do not require lawmakers to participate in sexual harassment training.\n\u2022 Legislatures in about one-fifth of the states added provisions since the #MeToo movement allowing for the external investigation of complaints, which some experts say is an important way of avoiding conflicts of interest and encouraging the targets of harassment to come forward. Even so, fewer than half the legislative chambers nationwide now allow for the external review of complaints.\nAfter about 150 women signed a public letter last October calling out \u201cpervasive\u201d harassment at the Capitol, lawmakers adopted whistleblower protections for legislative employees who report harassment and began publicly disclosing substantiated complaints against lawmakers and high-level staff members.\nSexual misconduct also was one of the most talked about topics when Florida's annual legislative session began in January.\nA Republican lawmaker had just resigned after a Senate investigation found he likely committed sexual misconduct, and a Democratic senator had stepped down after acknowledging an affair with a lobbyist.\nShe also cited \u201cpolitical games\u201d and an \u201cold boy\u201d culture at the Capitol.\n\u201cUntil we start changing minds and until we continue to push the narrative, we're not going to get anywhere,\u201d Book said."}

In contrast when the difference is small there are fewer winds and Britain shivers in a big freeze during the winter months.\nIt was previously thought that the NAO was a chaotic system which could not be predicted but the Met Office has used a technique called \u2018hindcasting\u2019 to check whether their new supercomputer could have predicted past winters.\nAfter looking back at weather data going back to 1981, they discovered that they could largely predict what the winter weather would have done for the past 35 years, a year in advance, with 42 per cent accuracy.\nThe scientists say it could allow governments, healthcare services and the energy and transport sectors to plan for future needs and \u2018weights the dice\u2019 in favour of making more accurate long term predictions.\nDr Nick Dunstone, the Met Office\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cUnderstanding and predicting the changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation could have significant economic benefits including potential boosts in climate services for a range of sectors including transport, energy, water management and the insurance industry.\n\u201cTwo years ago we showed we could predict the winter NAO up to one month ahead and that has helped predict river floods, delays at Heathrow, and problems in transport networks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we can use these one year ahead predictions to also inform planning. They are not going to be as accurate as the monthly forecasts but we have shown that they can spot what the North Atlantic Oscillation is doing.\nThe Met Office currently only gives outlooks a month ahead of winter, and was able to predict last year\u2019s winter flooding. But the new technique could help forecasters make even better predictions.\nForecasters say this winter is likely to be colder and drier than last year, which will bring relief to families who were flooded out of their homes over Christmas.\nProf Adam Scaife, head of Met Office Monthly to Decadal Prediction group, said: \u201cFrom as early as last October and November, our seasonal forecast system showed an enhanced risk of storms and very wet conditions for the early part of winter 2015/16 and then a transition to colder, drier conditions during late winter.\nThe Met Office has faced criticism in the past for its inaccurate forecasts, such as when Michael Fish wrongly dismissed the 1987 hurricane that killed 19 people.\nAfter the 2007 prediction of a \u201cbarbecue summer\u201d ended in a soggy washout, the Met Office pointed out that its seasonal forecast offered only a 65 per cent chance of being right.\nThe new system is unlikely to predict summer weather a year in advance as there are many more weather systems at play in the summer months.\nThe Met Office currently takes in 106 million observations a day from around the world using sources such as weather balloons, satellites and hundreds of commercial aeroplanes which send back data as they fly between destinations.\nThe new computer can perform more than 16,000 trillion calculations per second proving more accurate predictions than ever before.\nThe new research was published in the journal Nature Geoscience."}

To interest the fashion press, the team asked London Fashion Week designers, such as Tracey Boyd and Michiko Koshino, to create a 1980s-inspired outfit for a My Little Pony.\nThe ponies were then snapped by professional lifestyle photographers to achieve high-quality, glossy and eye-catching pictures.\nA press pack containing unusual facts about My Little Pony, a brief history of the brand, information about the new range and product samples were sent out to national, lifestyle, parenting, children's, collectors' and toy-retail trade press. National lifestyle and fashion press were offered exclusives in an effort to ensure that female readers who had grown up with My Little Pony, and might now have children themselves, were aware of the relaunch.\nTo generate coverage in celebrity magazines, Mason Williams researched famous figures, such as Beyonce Knowles, who had played with My Little Pony as children, and sent them product samples.\nFurthermore, the PR team publicised the relaunch of other retro toys to sell in stories about the trend for other 1980s toys. This positioned the dolls as part of a fashion movement to encourage articles to appear analytical, rather than product-led.\nTo maintain publicity after the launch, Mason Williams used a variety of topical news hooks.

These screenings are all performed by highly-trained technologists and evaluated by sub-specialty trained physicians in a caring, comfortable environment.\nColon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Pain in your bowel, colon, or stomach could be caused by many conditions, including ulcers, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal obstruction or cancer. A virtual colonoscopy can provide some answers.\nStroke and vascular disease affect thousands of Americans each year. A screening for these diseases can measure your risk and provide important information to help improve your vascular health and prevent life-threatening problems. The stroke and vascular screening at Inland Imaging includes a check of the three areas of your body that are most susceptible to signs of vascular disease: the abdominal aorta, the carotid arteries, and the peripheral arteries.\nA calcium scoring exam uses CT technology to screen for atherosclerosis and to evaluate your risk for heart disease. The exam measures the calcified plaque deposits on the artery and compares that measurement, or \u201cscore,\u201d to normal ranges for your age and gender.\nA low-dose CT scan of the chest can help to determine whether or not long time smokers and others with a high risk for lung cancer should be further evaluated and treated.\nScreening Mammography is the most reliable and effective method for the early detection of breast cancer. Finding cancer sooner rather than later provides patients and their health care providers a broader range of treatment options and a higher chance for survival. Inland Imaging suggests that women 40 years of age and older receive a screening mammogram annually.\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. But with early diagnosis, it\u2019s also one of the most curable. Screening prostate exams with Inland Imaging\u2019s 3T MRI can provide men and their health care providers with the fast, accurate answers they need.\nUltrasound is also a useful imaging tool in the study of the prostate. The exam may be performed to determine the volume of the prostate, to investigate elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, or to guide a needle biopsy of the prostate.\nIf you have nagging symptoms or just don\u2019t feel right, discuss it with your primary care provider. There\u2019s a good chance the appropriate screening exam at Inland Imaging can provide the answers you need to guide your medical care.\nTo learn more about screening options, go to www.inlandimaging.com or call (509) 455-4455.\nPublished: Sept. 13, 2018, 1:45 a.m. Updated: Sept. 20, 2018, 1:07 a.m."}

And recognizing the impact Duval was having on them, Love sought an encore, asking the former World No. 1 to address the squad.\nDuval was a key contributor to the 1999 U.S. squad that rallied to win the Ryder Cup.\nIf David Duval one day takes the reins as U.S. Ryder Cup captain, that sequence of events will have initiated it. As it stands, Duval is returning to the U.S. team room nightly during next week\u2019s Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in Paris, but this time in an official capacity. When Tiger Woods segued from vice captain to one of captain Jim Furyk\u2019s wildcard picks, Furyk filled the void with his good friend and former Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., neighbor.\nThe sports landscape is full of coaches who moved from the broadcast booth to the bench. It\u2019s rare in golf for an obvious reason: team events occur just once annually. The late Ken Venturi, a former U.S. Open champion who served as lead golf analyst for CBS Sports for more than 30 years, captained the winning U.S. Presidents Cup team in 2000, so Duval, who played on that team, isn\u2019t exactly breaking new ground.\nBut it\u2019s ground he never expected to traverse when it had been so long since he competed in the Ryder Cup.\nDuval, who was at the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C., when Furyk called to offer him the position, had an impact on the Ryder Cup before he ever played in it. Along with Woods, Mickelson and Mark O\u2019Meara, Duval pushed for the PGA of America to allow players to have a greater say in how the event\u2019s charitable proceeds were distributed. In a way, it was a precursor to today\u2019s organizational model, in which players and captains are more invested in the process.\nDuval\u2019s role has yet to be defined fully, but he senses what he brings to the table.\nIn his prime, Duval was considered one of the toughest competitors on tour.\nBefore a series of injuries derailed his career, Duval was a force as a competitor, winning 13 PGA Tour titles from 1997 to 2001, including his only major, the 2001 Open Championship. He was ranked No. 1 in the world twice for 15 weeks total in 1998 and \u201999. Participating in the Ryder Cup again affords him a luxury he seldom has enjoyed since he married his wife Suzie in 2004.\n\u201cHonestly, there are a several things that excite me about doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the most satisfying has been the reception from the players and the other captains.

{"idx": "8067", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Little Dipper (lower left) and the Big Dipper as seen this time of year from mid-northern latitudes, high in the northeast a couple hours after sunset.\nThe seven stars from which we derive the Little Bear, or Ursa Minor in the night sky are also known as the Little Dipper.\nPolaris, the North Star lies at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, whose stars are rather faint. Its four faintest stars can be blotted out with very little moonlight or street lighting.\nThe best way to find your way to Polaris is to use the so-called pointer stars in the bowl of the Big Dipper, Dubhe and Merak. Just draw a line, between these two stars and prolong it about 5 times, and you eventually will arrive in the vicinity of Polaris.\nExactly where you see Polaris in your northern sky depends on your latitude. From New York City it's almost halfway from the horizon to the overhead point (called the zenith). At the North Pole, you would find it directly overhead. At the equator, Polaris would appear to sit right on the horizon. So if you travel to the north, the North Star climbs progressively higher the farther north you go. When you head south, the star drops lower and ultimately disappears once you cross the equator and head into the Southern Hemisphere.\nAside from the North Star the two stars at the front of the Little Dipper's bowl are the only ones readily seen. These two are often referred to as the \"Guardians of the Pole\" because they appear to march around Polaris like sentries; the nearest of the bright stars to the celestial pole except for Polaris itself. Columbus mentioned these stars in the log of his famous journey across the ocean and many other navigators have found them useful in measuring the hour of the night and their place upon the sea.\nThe two other stars that complete the pattern of the bowl of the Little Dipper are of fourth and fifth magnitude, which means you may struggle to see them from a city or suburban setting.\nThus, the bowl of the Little Dipper, which is visible at any hour on any night of the year from most localities in the Northern Hemisphere, can serve as an indicator for rating just how dark and clear your night sky really is. If, for example, you can readily see all four stars in the bowl, you've got yourself a good-to-excellent sky. Unfortunately, thanks to the spread of light pollution in recent years, only the Guardians are usually visible from most city and suburban sites, meaning the quality of the sky would rank fair-to-poor.\nFinally, there is a popular misconception in that many believe that the North Star is the brightest star in the sky.\nI still remember when I was a very young boy how an uncle of mine pointed to a brilliant bluish star high in the midsummer sky and told me that it was the North Star (it was actually Vega, in the constellation Lyra). Yet Polaris actually ranks only 49th in brightness. It remains in very nearly the same spot in the sky year-round while the other stars circle around it. Only the apparent width of about one and a half full Moons separates Polaris from the pivot point directly in the north around which the stars go daily.\nHowever, on account of the wobble of the Earth's axis (called precession), the celestial pole shifts as the centuries go by.\nPolaris is actually still drawing closer to the pole and on March 24, 2100, it will be as close to it as"}
{"idx": "8068", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Having examined how gender ideology undermines human wholeness (or integrity), it is time to look outward to see its inescapable impact on society as a whole. The fundamental principle here is that a healthy social order must always be rooted in male-female complementarity. In the passionate individualism which has overtaken Western culture, we have lost sight of this important truth. We cannot see the forest for the trees.\nThe trees in this case are particular human persons. In our atomistic view of society, this particularity is all that we see; what we do not see is that an excessive emphasis on the individual destroys the very conditions necessary for persons to flourish. Without society as a whole, each person must be in the position of starting over again in every way. All chance at improvement is lost, beyond what a single person can accomplish unaided in his or her own lifetime. Thus there can be very little progress of any kind, including moral progress, without the benefit of a social order which, with all its interdependencies, embodies a culture. This culture, in turn, is extended through time by what we call tradition.\nThis is not just a matter of \u201chuman achievement\u201d. The social order and the tradition which shapes its fundamental character over time are necessary even to individual happiness, for the human person is definitively social. Even at the purely natural level, the human person knows that he is made for love, which is the most fundamental of all social goods.\nIt does not take an advanced degree in hieroglyphics to realize that the natural personal structure for intimate human love is the same as the natural personal structure for human reproduction. As embodied beings, that structure is revealed to us first in the male-female complementarity of the sexual organs. Already this tells us that we are designed for a special sort of social union, a kind of completion in a greater wholeness. Arising from this organic, in-built differentiation, this male-female complementarity flowers in a variety of ways in each and every healthy person. It plays some role in every human interaction and achievement and, most directly of all, it establishes the marital structure\u2014the very basis of the family, and of society itself.\nEvery examination that has ever been made, whether using common sense or scientific analysis, has concluded that the family, rooted in male-female complementarity, is by far the most successful vehicle for bringing new persons into the world, new persons who can grow up to be happy adults. At one level, this integral happiness is reflected in the term \u201cwell adjusted\u201d. Gender ideology consistently pretends this is not the case, that a wide variety of social arrangements for dealing with children can be implemented with equal or better results. But every honest observer knows that the family is so superior in this respect that a social order without a strong family structure will inescapably suffer all kinds of spiritual, psychological, and physical dislocations. Where the family in general is very weak, a social order loses its ability to nurture and protect. Ceasing to be rooted in permanent bonds of human love, it is doomed.\nEvery child thrives best with a permanently committed mother and father. It is the irrevocable character of this commitment which enables the openness and trust that are actually necessary to know and respond properly to all the members of the family. Social destruction is first and foremost rooted in the fundamental betrayals of the unitive and procreative goods toward which marital commitment is ordered. The first signs of betrayal are the refusal of new life (as in contraception) and the refusal of constancy in love (as in divorce). It has proven to be a short historical step from these refusals to the substitutions"}

She'd bring the baby with her.\"\nRangel did the bulk of the choreography for \"Trickster,\" which will make its own debut this weekend in \"Trickster and Other Dances,\" the modern troupe's annual June concert. The show also includes a Charlotte Adams work, \"Dichotomy,\" a reprise of Randy James' \"With Waves at My Back\" from the January show and dances by company members.\nBased on Native American tales about trickster coyotes, \"Trickster\" is a big work for 10 dancers, divided into four main sections and an intro, lasting about 30 minutes total. It's set to a brand-new score composed by guest artist William Campbell, a former adjunct music professor at Pima Community College. Campbell is now on the full-time faculty at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers.\n\"We'd been wanting to work with Bill,\" Rangel said. \"He did a Theatrical Mime Theater show last year. We took him out to lunch and traded ideas. Bill and I both were familiar with the coyote myths.\"\nOnce they settled on a compilation of Indian tales, Campbell composed primarily electronic music.\n\"The music is somewhat hybrid,\" Rangel said. \"It's rhythmic. It could be either Native American or African-American-influenced. Sometimes there are drums and shaken instruments. For the Star section, it has a more New Age feel, a big flavor. It sounds like stars.\"\nDancer Katie Rutterer plays Coyote. The opening Star section is based on a creation story. Pima drama student Norman Graves plays the Creator, and neatly places stars in the sky in an orderly pattern. Coyote sneaks in after the Creator is done, \"takes the stars and throws them into the constellations.\"\nIn the dance version, as Rutterer tosses stars from a bucket, nine dancers take over and \"act as the stars and move into position. They fall into the Little Dipper, Orion's Belt, Pleaides and the Southern Cross. We tried to pick stories,\" Rangel added, \"that had movement possibilities.\"\n\"These are actual Indian stories from the oral tradition,\" Rangel said. \"But they've been combined. They're not really Southwestern\"--as the green-tree dance attests.\nThe dancers are dressed in glittery pastels for their turn as stars; in brown and green for the forest scene; and in animal costumes borrowed from Thom Lewis, who used them in his \"Pound Puppies\" piece for FUNHOUSE movement theater. Company dancers will take to the stage, along with some performers borrowed from other troupes, and youth company members.

Videos of police abusing or even killing civilians, for example, have resulted in less trust for them, while insights into abuse by Catholic priests and their superiors have undermined faith in the church.\nUltimately, though, society as a whole will benefit as the public learns how institutions are really functioning: \u201cIn the short term, [added transparency] is undermining our trust.

All computers in this series feature an Intel 8th generation processor, up to 16GB of RAM with 2-in-1 chassis. The small 2.7mm webcam allows specific models to have thin bezels on all three sides and offers image quality improvements such as noise-reduction.\nA fingerprint sensor is present for quick and secure login, and Cortana voice-assistant compatibility, which also means that the far-field microphone has a certain minimum level of quality to be certified for that usage.\nAll have at least one USB-C (3.1 Gen1) with support for power-delivery and DisplayPort. This is mainly in case you want to use a USB-C Dock, but power-delivery can be useful in general. Interestingly, they also feature a round power connector for charging.\nAll three laptops share a lot of the same design language and industrial design methodology, with what appears to be a CNC aluminum chassis with diamond cuts around the fingerprint reader and the trackpad area. The manufacturing is quite above-average for that price range, and although you can get better with higher-end laptops such as the Dell XPS 13, this line of product is built to be more affordable.\nThe multiple sizes allow Dell to tweak the functionalities and extend this offering, in many ways. For instance, the 13\u201d and 15\u201d have two sub-editions: Black and Silver, with the Black Edition being the fancier, more powerful one, with options like 4K display (13\u201d or 15\u201d), Core i7-8565U processor, and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD.\nThese two models also support an Active Pen (optional) if you like to use Windows Ink. From our brief time with the laptops, we thought that the responsiveness of the pen was very good for note-taking and drawing. It is probably nice to work with Photo Editing software as well unless you want a digitizer tablet.\nThe 15\u201d Inspiron 7000 can be ordered with an optional NVIDIA GeForce MX150 which roughly doubles graphics performance for games and 3D-intensive apps. Applications that use the graphics processor for computing (video editing and more) will also benefit from the extra horsepower. This model can also get 16GB of Intel Optane memory, in addition to the 16GB of RAM.\nBy the way, all three laptops have a thermal design that evacuates the heat where the display hinges are (\u201cventing hinges\u201d as Dell would say). In fact, the designers even thought of making it very difficult for the hot air to find its way to the \u201cfresh air\u201d intake at the bottom of the computer.\nFinally, the larger 15\u201d chassis has more storage options such as 1TB of PCIe SSD, or 128GB of SSD + 2TB 5400rpm hard drive.\nThe 17\u201d Inspiron 7000 does not feature thin bezels, and the maximum resolution is 1920\u00d71080 (FHB/1080p) which tells us that it is destined to be a desktop replacement for someone who wants to have a neat desk.

The structures around piers, as well as the manner in which they allow anglers to get out over deeper water, give Pinellas County pier fishermen a distinct advantage over shore anglers.\nThe Redington Long Pier (tampabayfishingpier.com) extends 1,200 feet into the Gulf of Mexico. A privately operated facility, the pier charges a daily-use fee --- an annual pass is available for purchase --- but no fishing license is required for anglers on the pier. A number of amenities, such as sun shelters, benches, a concession stand and a full-service bait and tackle shop are available. Common Florida inshore species, such as redfish, snook and flounder, are typical catches for anglers who use the pier.\nBilling themselves as \"the world's longest fishing piers,\" the Sunshine Skyway Fishing Pier State Park's (skywayfishingpiers.com) piers are actually the closed portion of the old causeway over Tampa Bay. The newer bridges, built in 1970, still are open to freeway traffic. Anglers who pay the entrance fee can drive out to their chosen fishing location and drop a line into the mouth of Tampa Bay where it mingles with the open Gulf of Mexico. The piers are open 24 hours a day, and each pier has its own full service bait and tackle shop. Shark, tarpon and kingfish are common target species from the piers.\nOne of Pinellas County's longest piers extending into the waters of Tampa Bay --- rather than the Gulf of Mexico. St. Petersburg Pier (stpetepier.com) has been accommodating anglers, including avian fishermen like pelicans, since 1923. Offering everything from equipment rentals to fishing charters, the Pier Baithouse (thepierbaithouse.com) is a full-service bait and tackle shop that's open every day, year-round. Suffering from more fishing pressure than some of the other county piers, anglers still have success working the structure around the pilings. Snook, sheepshead and other inshore species are common.\nOwned and operated by Clearwater Beach, Pier 60 (pier60fishing.com) is a premier destination for catching trophy snook. The pier's fishing report notes that 20-lb. snook are pulled over the railing on a near-daily basis. Open 24 hours per day, seven days a week, from April through September, Pier 60 offers shaded pavilions, rod rentals and a bait and tackle shop.

{"idx": "8108", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act in June and sent it to the Senate. The House bill, running to 1,428 pages, aspires in one breathtaking stroke to take on renewable energy, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), nuclear power, electric vehicles, carbon cap and trade, power transmission, energy efficiency and climate adaptation. It ranges from grand vision to minutiae.\nYet missing from this sprawling draft is prioritization. To accomplish a worldwide, fundamental energy overhaul, we will need to keep our eye on the big picture\u2014the technology systems that will make a large, lasting difference\u2014and not get mired in excruciating details.\nOf the dozens of actions discussed in the bill, only half a dozen or so are likely to make a consequential difference. Putting a price on carbon is the single most important policy, because that will indeed send a signal through the economy to shift to low-carbon technologies. Alas, a straightforward tax on carbon would be far superior to the cumbersome cap-and-trade system proposed in the House bill. Politicians hate the word \u201ctax\u201d and like to distribute free emissions permits to powerful interest groups. The result is an overly complicated and somewhat arbitrary system but is still much better than nothing. At least carbon emissions would finally bear a market price under the legislation, and the Senate still has time for major improvements.\nRamping up nuclear power is probably the second most important measure, because it is currently the most scalable, cost-competitive source of noncarbon electricity. The legislation is decidedly ambivalent about nuclear power, reflecting the continuing divisions within the environmental community between advocates and staunch foes. Whether or not we choose to expand nuclear power, China and many other countries certainly will. The U.S. should as well; it is necessary for a cost-effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThird, CCS needs to be tested and, if successful, rapidly and extensively deployed. The legislation rightly champions CCS, although many environmentalists continue to oppose coal unconditionally. Yet as with nuclear, even if environmentalists turn up their noses at coal, China, India and other countries will keep on using it heavily. So, too, will the U.S. The key is to ensure that future coal plants are using CCS.\nFourth, we need to develop our tremendous solar potential. Investments in large-scale solar power are very likely to pay off monumentally within years or decades, but an integrated strategy of R&D, feed-in tariffs and other forms of support to bring that great potential to fruition will be essential.\nFifth, the U.S. must speed and complete the changeover of its vehicle fleet to a new generation of electric ones, including plug-in hybrids, battery-operated vehicles and fuel-cell automobiles. Either America will learn to produce such cars competitively, or it will end up importing them from China, Europe and Japan.\nSixth, we need to exploit the vast, unfulfilled opportunities for fuel efficiency in electric motors, lightbulbs, appliances, and home heating and cooling. Energy-efficiency programs in California and Japan during the past 20 years have shown the remarkable gains that can be achieved, often at large savings to consumers.\nThe bill covers all these topics, along with countless sideshows and boondoggles. There is continuing support for a corn-based biofuel policy, which wastes food supplies and taxpayer dollars without doing much to reduce carbon emissions (chalk this policy up to the political weight of the Iowa caucus).\nThe White House"}

With this in mind, the two of them worked together to bring up Aria\u2019s grade, and bring it up they did. After his final test in January, he came home with exactly what he wanted: a passing grade.\nBut what might seem like a mediocre grade deserving punishment to some parents was received with such joy and celebration from this father that you would have thought his son had just won the Nobel Prize in physics. After seeing this father\u2019s reaction (and the effect it had on his son), I realized again how important it is to not just understand that there are varying definitions of \u201csuccess\u201d for each child, but to celebrate those successes like crazy.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve always struggled with making realistic goals and expectations for both my children and myself. After all, if you don\u2019t set high goals, you\u2019ll never get anywhere, right? But expecting too much from either yourself or your children can backfire depending on the outcome. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act most of us have yet to master.\nIt also doesn\u2019t help when parents and children have very different talents and capacities for success. An over-achieving (over-anxious, over-bearing) parent may have a hard time learning to give this kind of unconditional love and acceptance to a child who isn\u2019t meeting their high and super-specific expectations. Not all children are \u201cchips of the old block\u201d, and learning to love our children for who they really are is one of the inherent rights and responsibilities of parenthood.\nAgain, this young man just got a \u201cC\u201d in math\u2013nothing extraordinary\u2013but you can feel the love and support his father extends to him for doing his personal best. It begs the question, what will help a child the most in life anyway? An \u201cA\u201d or the unconditional love and support of a parent? Obviously, both are important, but I think the overwhelming response to this youtube video answers that question. People respond to love more than any other thing.\nYou may not be the super emotive type that breaks into tears like this dad did in the video, but true feelings of joy and love will come through in whatever way they are expressed. You can never go wrong with love. By helping our children figure out their true capacity for success, working with them to reach realistic goals, and celebrating with them like crazy when they dosucceed, we not only prepare them for more success, but we enjoy some of the sweetest experiences and feelings that parenthood has to offer. If you ask me, that\u2019s a real A+.\nQUESTION: How are you and your child(ren) different in terms of capacity for success? How do you help your child make realistic goals and reach them?

The company already sells the two-door coupe in GT, GT S, GT C and GT R variants; the Roadster currently comes in GT and GT C forms; and don't forget the upcoming GT 53, GT 63 and GT 63 S four-door models. That's quite a portfolio, all based on the same set of strong bones. Of course, can you really have too much of a good thing?\nThe new S Roadster fits right between the GT and GT C -- just as it does on the Coupe. That means it uses Mercedes' ubiquitous 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, with 515 horsepower and 494 pound-feet of torque. That's an increase of 35 horsepower and 8 pound-feet compared to the base GT Roadster, though still 46 horsepower and 29 pound-feet shy of the hotter GT C. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\nEvery other GT S spec splits the difference between GT and GT C. The all-important 0-60 sprint takes 3.7 seconds in the GT S, compared to 3.9 in the base car and 3.6 in the GT C. Top speed is said to be 192 miles per hour, right between the GT's 188 mph rating and the GT C's 196 mph.\nWith its staggered wheel/tire setup, big brakes and adaptive damping system, the GT S is closer to the GT C than it is the base GT.\nThe GT S gets the same wheel, tire and brake setup as the GT C, with staggered 19-inch front and 20-inch wheels, wrapped in 265/35R19 and 295/30R20 tires. Large 15.4-inch brakes reside up front, with smaller 14.2-inch units out back. Mercedes also fits the GT S with the GT C's adaptive damping control, as well as the optional Race mode in the Dynamic Select drive settings.\nVisually, the GT S and GT C are basically identical, both inside and out. The only real difference is that while the GT C comes standard with Nappa leather seats, the GT S uses Mercedes' \"Artico/Dynamica\" leather. And that's, like, barely different.\nLook for the GT S Roadster to arrive in Mercedes-Benz showrooms near the end of 2018. Pricing isn't available just yet, but expect it to split the difference between its siblings. With the GT Roadster starting at $124,400 and the GT C Roadster coming in at $157,000, we'd be shocked if the GT S didn't start somewhere in the $140,000-145,000 range."}

I wonder what would be the American-led war on terror\u2019s explanation of such \u201cerudite\u201d historians of Islam \u2013 that the cause of \u201cthe clash of civilizations\u201d can be found in the Crusades when Richard the Lionheart and Saladin were skirmishing in the Levant and exchanging courtesies at the same time?\nIn modern times, the Sunni-Shi\u2019a conflict in the Middle East region is essentially a political conflict between the Gulf Arab autocrats and Iran for regional dominance which is being presented to lay Muslims in the veneer of religiosity. Saudi Arabia which has been vying for power as the leader of Sunni bloc against the Shi\u2019a-dominated Iran in the regional geopolitics was staunchly against the invasion of Iraq by the Bush Administration in 2003.\nThe Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein constituted a Sunni Arab bulwark against Iran\u2019s meddling in the Arab World. But after Saddam was ousted from power in 2003 and subsequently when elections were held in Iraq which were swept by Shi\u2019a-dominated parties, Iraq has now been led by a Shi\u2019a-majority government that has become a steadfast regional ally of Iran. Consequently, Iran\u2019s sphere of influence now extends all the way from territorially-contiguous Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and the Mediterranean coast.\nMoreover, during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Bush Administration took advantage of ethnic and sectarian divisions in Iraq and used the Kurds and Shi\u2019as against the Sunni-led Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein. And during the occupation years, from 2003 to 2011, the once dominant Sunni minority was politically marginalized which further exacerbated the ethnic and sectarian divisions in Iraq.\nThe Saudi royal family was resentful of Iranian encroachment on the traditional Arab heartland. Therefore, when protests broke out against the Shi\u2019a-dominated Assad regime in Syria in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, the Gulf Arab States along with their regional Sunni allies, Turkey and Jordan, and the Western patrons gradually militarized the protests to dismantle the Iranian axis.\nAccording to reports, Syria\u2019s pro-Assad militias are comprised of local militiamen as well as Shi\u2019a foreign fighters from Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and even the Hazara Shi\u2019as from as far away as Afghanistan and Pakistan. And similarly, Sunni jihadists from all over the region have also been flocking to the Syrian battlefield for the last six years. A full-scale Sunni-Shi\u2019a war has been going on in Syria, Iraq and Yemen which will obviously have its repercussions all over the Islamic World where Sunni and Shi\u2019a Muslims have coexisted in"}

Of the rest, 6 percent were found effective, 24 percent moderately effective, 14.5 percent adequate, and 5.1 percent ineffective.\nThe PART analysis for each program describes strengths and weaknesses and what steps the agency will take to improve. For example, the FBI's Cybercrime program was rated results not demonstrated. The program is getting a budget increase to $133 million, from $89 million, consistent with its 100 percent rating in the purpose assessment. However, the PART rating indicates the FBI must set performance goals and hold managers accountable for results.\nWhile the PART and agency business cases for IT investments are not directly linked, good use of IT can drive up the productivity score of PART assessments, said Mark Forman, the administration's top IT official."}

It allows the company's network edge to compress an image on the fly based on the available bandwidth.\n\"We know that we can, because of the screen resolution on a small smartphone, compress an image quite a long way to ensure the optimization of the delivery without impacting the image quality,\" said Reid.\nAkamai has also improved its ability to cache dynamic and personalized content, he said.\nAqua Ion will also allow sites to talk to devices that use IPv6 without having to re-engineer their current IPv4-based infrastructure, according to Akamai.\nThe need for enterprises to start preparing for IPv6 is growing ever more important as the availability of spare IPv4 addresses dwindles. That's key in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, where RIPE NCC, the authority that allocates IP addresses for the region, has started to hand out IPv4 addresses from the last block that it holds.\n\"Our solution gives enterprises the time and chance to upgrade all their kit,\" said Reid."}

And a lot of people think when they talk about bullying is that we can just solve it by kind of teaching kids to be kinder to one another or implementing these kind if anti-bullying programs where these ruthless punishments if somebody\u2019s seen bullying somebody. But when you talk about these issues of bullying a lot of people fail to understand the role of the institution in perpetuating issues such as bullying. And Peter Gray for example, a psychologist at Boston College has written about bullying and looked at prisons and schools and the effects of bullying on those institutions. And what he says is that when there\u2019s a population of people who are being held in an institution where they have no freedom to quit or ability to escape from that place, where they have very little ownership or voice and control over what happens in that institution, incidents such as bullying are rampant. And at schools it\u2019s very clear. I mean the statistics show that bullying is a major, major problem in most American schools.\nAnd what they find is that schools have a number of different qualities and one of them is the anti-democratic governing structure. If you look at most American high schools for example they are gargantuan mammoth institutions. They have thousands upon thousands of kids walking through the hallways every day. And what happens as a result of this \u2013 and this is not necessarily the fault of teachers or even just the people in that school building. When you have such a large student body and you don\u2019t have \u2013 you have large class sizes there\u2019s not enough time for students and teachers to have really strong authentic and genuine relationships. And students basically what happens is they get kind of thrown into this sea of being anonymous. They don\u2019t have any relationships with their students, with fellow peers and students at a really rich and authentic level. And so when students feel that they have no power or no agency in their school experiences what often happens is something called cliques arise. The students feel that they have to wield power and get control within themselves and within their ranks.\nAnd so cliques are one of the major phenomenon in American schools where they create basically power structures within the student body themselves. And so you have people at the top of the system who are essentially the most popular kids. And then you have kids at the bottom who are oftentimes the nerds and the people who are not so popular and don\u2019t have the best looks. And so you have this very destructive system that comes about and bullying is one of the side effects and symptoms that come out of that. And so what I would argue is that when you have institutions where students and teachers have strong relationships with one another, where students feel that they are known by an adult in that community, where they have agency and voice over those learning experiences, bullying incidents are very rare. And in my book I talk about institutions and free schools and democratic schools where bullying is almost nonexistent. And this is in large part due to the fact that students feel that they have a voice and role in their school decision making process and they have the structures in place to fix and alleviate incidents of bullying. So everything is transparent where they can bring it to an adult or the school community and show that this individual\u2019s bullying me and we need to rectify the situation.\nAnd not only that they have restorative justice practices.

The General Mining Act of 1872 allows mining on public lands, and Carson, president of the Empire-Fagan Coalition, has always questioned the law\u2014especially when such mining has the potential to jeopardize nearby residential wells and natural water sources.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency joined more than 200 regional organizations and individuals who filed formal protests during a recent public-comment period for the Corps of Engineers permit-application process. If approved, the application would allow the company to build a haul road through the middle of Davidson Canyon\u2014which is now considered a protected waterway by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.\nThe Fish and Wildlife and EPA letters ask the Corps of Engineers to do a larger-level environmental review to determine whether a permit should be issued\u2014particularly because the permit would allow the company to dredge and divert washes and wetlands that directly feed into the Cienega watershed.

The technology is designed to enable businesses to create more automated, flexible networks while driving down their operating and capital expenses.\nNVN also reveals what Netsocket officials were hinting at in April, when the company announced $9.2 million in funding to drive a new solution around SDN that would be introduced in the summer. In a statement at the time, President and CEO John White noted the company's experience in the unified communications (UC) service assurance solutions space with its Cloud Experience Manager.\n\"We plan to apply that same innovation and focused vision to the SDN market, which we expect to experience explosive growth this year,\" White said.\nThe result is NVN, the latest addition to a rapidly growing market of SDN products, solutions and platforms from a range of vendors, including established players like Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Juniper Networks and Brocade, as well as startups like Big Switch Networks and Plexxi, that are flooding the market. SDN holds the promise of creating more flexible, automated and programmable networks by separating network functions from the underlying physical hardware and housing them in software.\nIt also can help drive down networking costs by eliminating the need for more expensive switches and routers.\nAs more business moves to the cloud and virtualization spreads through servers and storage products, networking\u2014with its complex hardware and manual operations\u2014has been seen as the bottleneck in creating highly automated, dynamic and scalable data center infrastructures. SDN and network-function virtualization (NFV) are designed to bring networking to the same level as servers and storage.\n\"The Netsocket Virtual Network possesses a three-tiered SDN architecture that focuses on three important factors that have to be addressed to meet the needs of the cloud: functionality, management and integration,\" Tricia Hosek, vice president of products and marketing at Netsocket, wrote in a post on the company's blog.\nIncluded in Netsocket's offering, aimed at enterprises and service providers, are the vFlowController and vFlowSwitch, both of which run on Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization technology. The vFlowController can interoperate with legacy networks through three components: vRouter, vTunnel (for VPN capabilities) and vFirewall (for security). Those components are provided for free, according to Netsocket officials.\nNVN also includes two applications. The company's vNetCommander software brings centralized management, handling such tasks as the automated installation, provisioning and orchestration of the network.

The inspector denied them a ride to the hospital four stops away, but later allowed Roberts to board the next train.\nThe driver told them to get off the train and refused to move. He called over a fare inspector. The inspector forced them off the train and told them to call an ambulance if they needed help. But for some reason he also told them they could take the next train, which was right behind them (that\u2019s three N-Judah\u2019s bunched in a row, in case anyone\u2019s counting). However, he still wouldn\u2019t let Dyer on with his bike, folded or not, because it is a larger, folding cargo bike model. Dyer had to ride his bike behind the train while Roberts-with cuts and a large bump growing on her head-was left alone with her now-folded bike.\nAccording to Streetsblog, the driver also \"came out of the cab to yell at Roberts to 'secure her bike' which had flopped over on the floor. 'I was weak. I had a concussion,' she said. 'The car was almost empty. I wasn\u2019t blocking anybody.'\"\nSpeaking with the Ex, SFMTA spokesperson Erica Kato is apologetic, to a point.\nThe incident has inspired Streetsblog to wonder \"why are we banning bikes on late-night trains in the first place!\" Noting that bikes are allowed on BART, the website says that \"Nobody\u2019s arguing that full-sized bikes should be allowed during peak periods.

Jerry Brown, included a report that 27 major cities around the world have seen emissions decrease over a five-year period and are now at least 10 percent lower than their peak.\nThe star-studded conference included a rousing call to action by Harrison Ford, who implored the audience to protect forests, fisheries and other natural wonders. Former President Barack Obama, under whose watch the U.S. agreed to the landmark Paris climate accord, made a brief appearance by video.\nThe goal of the conference is to showcase actions already being taken to prevent climate change and to \u201cinspire deeper commitments\u201d among attendees. It was unclear what specific actions might be taken before the summit ends Friday.\n\u201cDoing nothing is not an option. Going green is a must. Cities all over the world are on the front lines of climate change,\u201d said Frank Jensen, lord mayor of Copenhagen, adding that the bicycle-friendly city wants even more bike lanes.\nMilan and Copenhagen are among the 27 major cities cited by C40 Cities Climate Leadership, a group whose board is headed by philanthropist and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nIn a speech, Bloomberg called the conference a way to broadcast that the U.S. is still committed to the cause.\nBloomberg and Brown said they calculate the U.S. is within striking distance of the reduction in greenhouse gases it previously promised.\nTrump announced last year that he was withdrawing from the l climate accord. His administration is also pursuing policies that would boost methane emissions and roll back California\u2019s strict vehicle emissions standards.\nIn response to a question Thursday at a news briefing, Brown, Democrat, said Trump will likely be remembered poorly when it comes to the environment. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be remembered, on the path he\u2019s now? I don\u2019t know.

In response, the governor said California has the most integrated and comprehensive oil reduction plan in America.\nThe U.S. Climate Alliance, which involves 17 governors, announced Thursday that it would commit to several actions, including making clean energy cheaper for consumers and promoting vehicles and transit that rely on renewable energy.\nThe summit came with 2018 on pace to be the fourth hottest year on record globally.

Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, for the first time called for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.\u201d HRC wasn\u2019t going to let Edwards enjoy his first-to-call-on-Gonzales-to-resign status for very long. See below.\nToday\u2019s news is only the latest and most disturbing sign of the politicization of justice under President Bush. From the abuse of investigative authority under the Patriot Act to the unconstitutional imprisonment of the Guantanamo Bay detainees and illegal torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Bagram Air Force Base, this president has consistently shown contempt for the rule of law.\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales betrayed his public trust by playing politics when his job is to enforce and uphold the law. By violating that trust, he\u2019s done a great disservice to his office. If White House officials ordered this purge, he should have refused them. If they insisted, he should have resigned in protest. Attorney General Gonzales should certainly resign now.\nWith the White House now acknowledging a direct role in the Justice Department\u2019s U.S. Attorney firings, the president must affirmatively step forward to explain what he is doing to address the politicization of our prosecutorial system and what role he and his aides played in this controversy.\nThe president is the chief executive of the country and this matter goes to the heart of his ability to manage our federal law enforcement and U.S. Attorney system. It is imperative that the president act swiftly to explain what role the White House played in this situation, hold those who acted inappropriately accountable, and take responsibility.\nYes, she asked Bush to take responsibility. Has she not been paying attention?\nI opposed Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s nomination, in part, because he had shown in his role as White House Counsel a penchant for subverting justice to serve the President\u2019s political goals, and I feared that in an Attorney General. Sadly, the latest revelations underscore my concern. Americans deserve to know who in the White House is pulling the strings at the Department of Justice, and why. Anyone involved should appear under oath and answer these questions.\nThat is perhaps a flippant way of looking at today\u2019s flurry of press releases from the Democratic candidates. But if this scandal does widen, expect Edwards to remind Democratic primary voters (over and over) that when evidence emerged suggesting the Bush administration perverted the federal prosecution system, he was the first to demand that Gonzales, who in 2005 approved the idea of firing a group of prosecutors, leave the administration. If the scandal peters out, no Democratic voter will hold it against Edwards that he demanded Gonzales\u2019 resignation. Yet he may well end up with the bragging rights. After all, you never know where a scandal is heading or how big it will become.\nWhat\u2019s Alberto Gonzalez\u2019s worst mistake? Cast your vote in the Nation Poll."}

{"idx": "8154", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Ty Cobb: Was baseball's bad guy really that bad?\nA new book is questioning whether the public perception of Ty Cobb as a contemptible racist and unforgiving competitor is right.\nIt wasn't just baseball that was new. There was also the widespread use of electricity. The typewriter. The airplane. Moving pictures. And in those early years of the 20th Century, for the first time in history, people had enough leisure time and resources to seek out mass entertainment.\nWhat did they choose to do? They watched baseball. And Detroit Tigers center fielder Ty Cobb was its first star.\nBut more than 50 years after his death, Cobb is remembered less for his astonishing ability on the field than as a monster fans love to hate. Books, plays, radio shows and newspapers have told and retold stories about Cobb as a mean-spirited egoist who sharpened his spikes to cut infielders on a slide, made racist taunts and beat up fans who looked at him funny. In the 1994 film \"Cobb,\" starring Tommy Lee Jones, the ballplayer is introduced as unshaven, surrounded by bottles of pills and booze and recklessly shooting his gun at a guest who knocks on his door. Woozy with painkillers, the Cobb character spins himself into a fury when he can't get his biographer to describe him as \"a prince among men.\" The Free Press itself described its hometown hero as \"dangerous to the point of dementia.\" \"No one came to his funeral,\" is an erroneous but oft-quoted belief.\nAt the same time, a small contingent of fans has argued that Cobb is misunderstood: that his bad behavior should be understood as a product of his time, and in context of the trauma of his mother killing his father in Georgia just days before he shipped north to play ball in Detroit. And, revisionists say, his good deeds \u2014 like using money he made via savvy investing to finance a hospital in Georgia and a college scholarship fund \u2014 have been unjustly unheralded.\nCobb's complexity has made it possible for fans to see in him whatever it is they want to see \u2014 and for writers, historians and filmmakers to emphasize the sides of Cobb they most want to present. It is not all that different from how the city of Detroit has experienced the public eye in the years since Cobb's death in 1961. Just as Detroit's best and worst characteristics have made it an object of fascination, Cobb's story is one we just can't drop. His talent alone would be enough to make him a legend \u2014 from the time he stole second, third and home on three consecutive pitches to the time he went on a 40-game hitting streak. But vile portrayals of the first player to be inaugurated into the Hall of Fame have lingered in our cultural memory for far more than his unmatched batting records.\nCharles Leerhsen, a former executive editor of Sports Illustrated, aims to square the outsized image of Cobb with the real-life man in the new biography, \"Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty\" (Simon & Schuster, $27.50). It's the difference between \"Ty Cobb\" \u2014 who was portrayed in the 2004 book \"American Monsters\" alongside Charles Manson and John Wilkes Booth \u2014 and plain old Ty Cobb.\nAs Leerhsen tells it, Cobb's baseball career began at the same moment that America was ready to embrace a popular culture"}

It pairs nicely with the gameplay because the player will need to learn how to fight dirty and be unrelenting in order to succeed. The story and world aren\u2019t as cryptic as \u201cDark Souls,\u201d but it still doesn\u2019t make for a very compelling tale upfront. Still, this story of loyalty, defiance and destiny fits the world very well.\nOne of the most interesting things about \u201cSekiro\u201d is how it creates a level playing field for anyone who starts it. Veterans of From Software games usually have a much easier time getting them when a new one comes out, but this one mixes up the combat to subvert expectations. Players will have to focus on the use of tools and knowing when to be aggressive in order to survive. Even basic enemies can be a major threat, especially early in the game.\nCombat overall feels tougher due to the removal of certain RPG elements from past games. If a player was struggling, they could level up or upgrade their weapons, but now the only real way to surpass a challenge is to adapt and learn. Improving in this game can be really satisfying and beating tough bosses gives a rush like nothing else in gaming. The animations are impressive and experimenting with the different skills and prosthetic tools add to the depth of combat.\nAside from good timing and defense, stealth can also be used to take out enemies. It\u2019s unfortunate that the stealth mechanics weren\u2019t as fleshed out to the same degree as standard combat. Instead of it being a viable way to get through the game stealth is more of an optional way of thinning out or weakening enemies before the real fight begins.\nAs I went through, I started getting mixed feelings about the bosses. A lot of the bosses in the first half make for fun and challenging fights. Bosses in the second half feel a lot more limited in how they can be fought. Windows for attacking becoming a lot shorter and the tactics for beating bosses become a lot more limited. Aggression and the use of counters become somewhat obsolete and replaced with blocking as well as hit and run tactics.\nBeing forced to fight bosses in one specific way makes them a chore instead of an interesting challenge. Beating them still feels good, but comes with a lot more frustration near the end of the game.\nFrom Software has developed a reputation for polished and unique games that delivers experiences other games just can\u2019t. The enemy design and combat are at the top of the industry, but it\u2019s not a fully consistent experience. I\u2019ve loved my time with \u201cSekiro,\u201d but the dip in quality in boss fights keep it from earning a full five stars and brings it down to four and a half stars.\nUlises Duenas is a critic without a cause, writing reviews for video games, movies and more.

One of the best surgeons in the hospital, he had done his own subspecialty training at a hospital famous for vascular surgery.\nHe nodded in approval when I told him where I was going; the hospital was known for excellent results with sick patients undergoing difficult operations.\nDr. Pauline Chen explores the doctor-patient bond.\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t believe him. I was convinced the hospital had superior results because the surgeons were so good. And I was eager to learn to operate like them.\nBut I had only been working there a short time when it became clear that in day-to-day patient care, good or even superb operative skills weren\u2019t enough to make a hospital\u2019s reputation. It was having a well-oiled team of clinicians who believed in supporting one another and doing their best.\nHospitals have long vied for the greatest clinical reputation, and recent efforts to increase public accountability by publishing hospital results have added a statistical dimension to this battle of the health care titans. Information from most hospitals on mortality rates, readmissions and patient satisfaction is readily available on the Internet. A quick click of the green \u201ccompare\u201d button on the \u201cHospital Compare\u201d Web site operated by the Department of Health and Human Services gives any potential patient, or competitor, side-by-side lists of statistics from rival institutions that leaves little to the imagination.\nThe upside of such transparency is that hospitals all over the country are eager to improve their patient outcomes. The downside is that no one really knows how.\nHospitals have made huge investments in the latest and greatest in clinical care \u2014 efficient electronic medical records systems, \u201csuperstar\u201d physicians and world-class rehabilitation services. Nonetheless, large discrepancies persist between the highest- and lowest-performing institutions, even with one of the starkest of the available statistics: patient deaths from heart attacks.\nAccording to a study released this week in The Annals of Internal Medicine, the answer to the decade-long conundrum may have little to do with investing in high-tech equipment and evidence-based protocols. Instead, improving patient outcomes may require first investing in and focusing on the culture of the organization itself.\nOver the course of a year, the researchers visited 11 hospitals that ranked in either the top 5 percent or the bottom 5 percent in mortality rates for heart attacks, and conducted more than 150 in-depth interviews with key administrators, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, quality management staff and other health care workers. The researchers then correlated hospital performance statistics with recurrent themes in the interviews and found that what really mattered was simply this: a cohesive organizational vision that focused on communication and support of all efforts to improve care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s how people communicate, the level of support and the organizational culture that trump any single intervention or any single strategy that hospitals frequently adopt,\u201d said Elizabeth H. Bradley, senior author and faculty director of the Yale Global Health Leadership Institute at Yale University.\nWhile business executives have long understood the impact of an organization\u2019s culture on the bottom line, it has not been clear if those same qualities could affect how well patients do. Earlier studies intimated otherwise, suggesting that factors like how rich or poor patients are, an affiliation with an academic medical center, the number of beds and an urban setting could account for the differences in hospital mortality rates.\nRather, it was the approach to challenging patient care issues that seemed to set institutions apart.

{"idx": "8165", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It's a question I've visited before here, but it's one that can never be discussed enough. I welcome every opportunity to further explore it.\nDaniel Pink, Dan Ariely, and I discussed this topic in my first post here in Several Ways To 'Motivate' the Unmotivated To Learn.\nAuthor and researcher Roy F. Baumeister reviewed this area as it relates to behavior in Several Ways To Help Students Develop Self-Control.\nBecky's question gives me an excuse to invite two other highly-respected educators and writers, Chris Wejr and Jeff Wilhelm, to share their thoughts here. They both have also devoted a great deal of time to research and practice on this challenging question.\nReaders have also contributed some exceptional comments.\nBecoming a father and making the transition to teaching primary students has made it very clear to me that our kids begin their lives with an inquisitive mind and an enviable level of excitement for learning. Primary students seem to have an energetic curiosity and require very little motivation for engagement; however, as these students progress through our system and the focus moves from the child to the curriculum and learning to grades, they often seem to lose that drive.\nWe, as parents and educators, often influence a shift in this drive by focusing on results and external motivators. By dangling things such as grades, praise, prizes, awards, and threats of punishment, we unintentionally rob students of responsibility and their intrinsic drive for learning; we alter the focus to what they will get rather than what they are doing. By the time students reach high school, their inquisitive desire to learn is often shifted to a quest for grades. For those students who do not see relevance and purpose in this quest, they often disengage as learners and then we feel the need to resort to motivating by offering carrots and threatening sticks.\nI strongly believe that (to adapt from Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, researchers of motivation at the University of Rochester (and written about by Daniel Pink in Drive), we cannot motivate students; we can only create the conditions in which students can motivate themselves. We cannot MAKE kids learn; we can make them behave a certain way, memorize and complete tasks in the short-term when we are supervising them but this does not mean they are gaining the skills and receiving the support needed to be learners.\n1.\tRelationships - a trusting, caring relationship helps students to understand the learning is about them rather than test scores and curricula. In order for us to make the curriculum relevant to their learning we must build relationships with our students.\n2.\tOwnership - Work WITH students so they have a voice in their learning. Through a focus on Assessment For Learning, we include students in assessments and provide ongoing dialogue around descriptive feedback (rather than grades) based on agreed upon criteria and goals. Harvard professor and author Dr. Ross Greene states that \"all students can do well if they can\"; we need to provide the feedback on behaviour and learning skills so kids can do well. Too, we need to include students in this conversation.\n3.\tChoice - Provide students with more autonomy of HOW they will learn and demonstrate their learning.\n4.\tRelevancy - Relate the curriculum to the interests and passions of our students.

{"idx": "8170", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: You already know what I thought  of the new film Brideshead Revisited, with its many distortions of the novel on which it is based. But I had the privilege of writing for an audience that I can assume is supportive, or at least respectful, of Waugh's original intent. (That's you.) So I thought it might be interesting to take a look at what more mainstream critics had to say about the film in general, and its relationship to the book in particular. Read on if you're curious -- but Waugh fans beware: it's not for the faint of heart.\nIn Waugh's book...religious commitments and social relations were part of a thickly detailed, complicated and ancient lived reality. The long experience of English Catholics as a religious minority, the subtle gradations of class in the British university system, the crazy quilt of sexual norms and taboos governing the lives of young adults: all of this is what makes Brideshead Revisited live and breathe as a novel. None of it registers with any force in this lazy, complacent film, which takes the novel's name in vain.\nScott is one of the few who perceived what seemed very obvious to me: director Julian Jarrold and his screenwriters either misunderstood what Waugh was doing or thought it required improving. (Sarah Lyall's feature article  on the film, also published in the NYT, suggests the former; screenwriter Jeremy Brock explains, apparently without irony, that the \"twitch upon the thread\" Waugh refers to -- that is, God's drawing sinners toward him, in an image from G. K. Chesterton -- is a reference to \"that tug between individual freedom and fundamentalist religion.\") You don't need to share Waugh's perspective on religion, or anything else, to recognize that his perspective is central to the novel, and that borrowing the setting and (to a lesser extent) the characters but rejecting the story's themes cannot make for a successful \"adaptation.\" But Scott was one of very few critics who pointed that out.\nOf course, he may also be one of the only film critics who isn't just pretending to be familiar with the novel. Richard Roeper  certainly doesn't seem to know much about it, and Variety's Dennis Harvey  bluffs, \"[T]his version's changes, in the end, serve to communicate the novel's complexities within a viable, theatrical-friendly format without ever appearing to rush or coarsen its general arc.\" In the New York Post, Kyle Smith  praises the novel but, in the same sentence, calls this adaptation \"honorable and respectful.\"\nA few are interested only in comparing the film to the television serial -- I might have expected that from USA Today , maybe even Newsweek  (which refers to the miniseries as \"the original\") -- but the worst offender is, believe it or not, NPR's Bob Mondello , who opens by listing recent TV series adapted to film, then adds: \"Now comes Brideshead Revisited, facing the opposite challenge: reducing an 11-hour original to two hours. And the filmmakers did the sensible thing: They went back to the book.\"\nCuriously, Waugh (1903-1966) had converted to Catholicism in 1930, 14 years before he wrote Brideshead Revisited... I say curiously because Waugh's literary alter ego, Charles Ryder, is a self-proclaimed atheist who loses Julia because he fails to appreciate how strong and lasting her Catholic upbringing has been in"}

The images fall in-line with the first set of prototypes that were photographed completely undisguised in China late last year. While it was expected that Suzuki will showcase the 250cc model at the Auto Expo this year, the manufacturer chose to remain mum about its project.\nTouted to be called the Suzuki GSX-R250, the patent images give a complete glimpse of how the model will look like with the design influence evident from the larger GSX-R1000. The sporty and sculpted fuel tank add a muscular stance to the bike, while the striking tail section will come with a LED tail light. The full fairing certainly looks edgy in its appeal complete with split seats, while the first spy shots from China have already revealed an all-digital instrument cluster. The older spied images also showcased that certain components could be shared with the smaller Gixxer 155 like the switchgear, instrument console among other bits.\nTalking about the powertrain, speculations are rife that the Suzuki GSX-R250 will be using a 250cc single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine tuned to produce just under 30bhp of power, whilst paired to a 6-speed gearbox. Rumours also suggest that the 250cc twin-cylinder motor from the Inazuma could serve duty on the R250, albeit in a different state of tune. However, that is something which remains highly speculative. The single-cylinder motor works for India as will it be cheaper than the twin and help the company lock horns with the competitively priced KTM RC 200. Unlike the track-bred RC, the GSX-R250 will lock horns with the Honda CBR250R given its sports touring appeal.\nWhich means, the Suzuki GSX-R250 will have a more relaxed riding position with raised clip-on handlebars and centre set foot pegs. Moreover, it is likely that the R250 will be based on the same diamond type frame underpinning the Gixxer and SF models in the country. In addition, the model will come with telescopic forks up front and a monoshock suspension at the rear, while braking performance will come from twin disc units. ABS will be standard on the model, given that the safety feature will be mandatory by next year in India on motorcycles above 125cc.\nSuzuki is yet to share details about the launch of the GSX-R250 globally, but one can expect the model to be unveiled towards the end of this year (EICMA maybe?), while the India launch could be possible in 2017 or later."}

It's accelerating melt will likely play a primary role in swelling Earth's oceans two or three feet higher this century, or perhaps as much as six feet.\nThe most vulnerable masses of ice are in West Antartica, where NASA has already witnessed an accelerating melt.\n\"They're melting like gangbusters,\" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an April interview.\n\"These are massive rivers of ice that are dumping just huge amounts of ice into the oceans.\"\nPerhaps most worrying, said Willis, is that this melting is unprecedented. Scientists are watching this thawing for the first time. They can see the melt is already accelerating \u2014 and it's unknown what's exactly to come.\n\"We have long suspected that changes in Earth\u2019s climate will affect the polar ice sheets,\" Andrew Shepherd, a climate scientist and one of the study's lead authors, said in a statement.\n\"Thanks to the satellites our space agencies have launched, we can now track their ice losses and global sea level contribution with confidence,\" said Shepherd. \"According to our analysis, there has been a steep increase in ice losses from Antarctica during the past decade, and the continent is causing sea levels to rise faster today than at any time in the past 25 years.\"\nOver this 25-year period, scientists measured around 7 and a half millimeters of sea level rise from the ice-clad continent.\nThis might not seem like a lot, Robin Bell, a marine geologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said over email. But, the more recent rapid loses in Antarctic ice \"indicates Antarctica can change faster than we thought,\" said Bell.\nIn fact, 40 percent of the total rise, or about 3 millimeters, came in the last 5 years. That's when things really started to change.\nUntil 2012, the study's researchers found that Antarctica had been shedding 84 billion tons of ice into the sea each year, incrementally boosting sea levels by around 0.2 millimeters annually.\nBut beginning in 2012, Antarctica began to lose nearly 240 billion tons per year, largely from two giant West Antarctic glaciers, Pine Island and Thwaites.\nThe West Antarctic ice is particularly vulnerable because these massive ice sheets sit over the ocean, and even slightly warmer ocean waters can eat away at them from the bottom.\nThe locations of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, which alone have enough ice to raise sea levels by 4 feet, says NASA.\n\"The largest mass loss is observed where relatively warm ocean waters are melting floating ice shelves from below,\" Steve Rintoul, a study co"}

And so I\u2019ve been buying more space on Google\u2019s servers. Recently, I hit 30 gigs \u2014 and learned Google won\u2019t let me purchase any more room. The service which once swore I\u2019d never have to delete a message now tells me my only option is to delete gigabyte after gigabyte of past e-mails.\nActually, I think the problem lies elsewhere. Ever since the birth of the PC, you\u2019ve taken a risk when you buy a new product. If it succeeds, it\u2019ll be around for a long time. If it doesn\u2019t, it will die. Google isn\u2019t breaking any new ground here.\nWhat\u2019s different is that Google\u2019s products are all cloud-based. When Google Reader goes away on July 1, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s gone. If it were an ordinary bit of software that I\u2019d installed on my PC, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It would keep on working for years even if it never got another update. I\u2019d need to replace it eventually\u2014because of an OS upgrade or a desire for new features that finally got too strong\u2014but I\u2019d probably have years to work that out.\nDitto for my email program, which is client-based. It will never run out of space, because I can always buy a bigger hard drive if I want to. If it goes away, I\u2019ll need to find a new email program, but I\u2019ll have plenty of time to do it.\nOf course, there\u2019s a price to be paid for this: I don\u2019t have access to my email archive everywhere I go. If I traveled a lot, that would be a huge drawback.\nMy preferred solution is to use old-school client-based software, but to store all data (or perhaps mirror all data) in the cloud. Sure, my storage provider might go out of business, but that\u2019s an annoyance, not a crisis. I just have to find a new cloud storage provider and move my data.\nThis problem is that this still isn\u2019t as easy as it should be, and anyway, for lots of applications the cloud application model provides some compelling advantages. But I\u2019m leery of it. I don\u2019t like being forced to upgrade whenever Google decides I should. (When they release a new version, that\u2019s what you get the next time you start up your browser. If you don\u2019t like it, tough.) I don\u2019t like having my software go away completely if Google tires of it. I don\u2019t like wondering if Google will put limits on how much data I\u2019m allowed to keep. I don\u2019t really even like Google having access to all my data in the first place. One way or another, I figure they\u2019re going to use it for marketing purposes, no matter how loudly they swear they never will.\nThe cloud is not your friend. Or maybe it is, but at best it\u2019s a fair-weather friend. We\u2019ve been seduced by free, and seduced by the cloud. We should probably all step back from the brink."}

{"idx": "8189", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There is an almost universal sentiment of fear and growing despair among Muslim citizens of the country. There is mounting disillusionment with all institutions of governance, and more so with the police and judiciary, as well as with political parties and to some extent the media. There is, on the one hand, the constant dread of being profiled as a terrorist, or of a loved one being so profiled, with the attendant fears of illegal and prolonged detention, denial of bail, torture, unfair and biased investigation and trial, and extra-judicial killings. There is, on the other hand, the lived experience of day to day discrimination, in education, employment, housing and public services, which entrap the community in hopeless conditions of insecurity, poverty and want. The consistent stereotypical profiling and insensitivity towards Muslims has pushed them from being citizens of a democratic country to the position of second grade citizenship. This kind of unsaid apathy and discrimination in a system that takes pride in calling itself democracy is highly undesirable. Despite constitutional and legislative guarantees Muslims in India not only continue to face discrimination and violation of their rights but unfortunately the past two decades have seen a steep rise in this discrimination.\nThe other important process which is adding to this problem is the role of the media. The liberal and secular character of the media in India, developed as a part of the national movement, has been considerably eroded in recent times. The divisive and sectarian media performs three well defined roles: the slow poisoning of the civil society through the production of a counter discourse to the secular and plural; the creation of conflict situations by distorting events, spreading rumours and pandering falsehood; the denigration of secular , liberal intelligentsia and cultural activists by attacking their integrity and undermining their professional competence.\nA large percentage of the community as a result of insecurity, apathy and poverty has moved into clusters totally cut off from modernity and exposure to new ideas. Even when schemes intended to give benefits to the Muslims are announced, they do not reach them or partially reach them. The efforts required to find innovative ways to reach out to a besieged community are totally lacking.\nThe National Meet 'Hum Jo Tareek Rahon Main Marey Gaye' attended by approximately 300 people from across India including the political leaders was the culmination of a two major tribunals held in 2008 and 2009 to document the conditions of Muslims in India as well as years of effort by independent civil society members, groups and a section of the media to expose the nefarious designs of the Sangh communal and terror networks.\nA combined report 'What it Means to be a Muslim in India Today' of the two tribunals Peoples Tribunal on The Atrocities Committed Against Minority In The Name Of Fighting Terrorism held at Hyderabad on 22-24 August 2008 and National Meet on the Status of Muslims in Contemporary India held in Delhi on 3-5 Oct 2009 was released today by victims- Mohd Raisuddin, Khatoon Bibi, Qamar Jahan Sheikh, Salmabi, political leaders Digvijay Singh, Ramvilas Paswan, Sitaram Yechury, senior journalist and editor Siasat -Zahid Ali Khan and social activist Shabnam Hashmi.\nThe tribunals were organised by Anhad in collaboration with Siasat, Hyderabad and Human Rights Law Network.\n'What it means to be a Muslim in India Today' is a compilation of real life stories.

{"idx": "8190", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As I mentioned in my post about beer made from recycled bread, I've been reading Paul Hawken's Drawdown. Among the proposed climate solutions in the book, some have seemed ambitious in scale\u2014perhaps even fanciful. But I was struck by the fact that Drawdown is predicting only 16% of global passenger miles will be in electric vehicles by 2050.\nTony Seba, for example, has previously predicted that all new road vehicles, globally, will be 100% electric by 2030. And he's building on that prediction with a new report, co-authored by James Arbib, entitled Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030: The Disruption of Transportation and the Collapse of the ICE Vehicle and Oil Industries.\n\u201495 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand Autonomous Electric Vehicles (A-EVs) owned by companies providing Transport as a Service (TaaS).\n\u2014A-EVs engaged in TaaS will make up 60 percent of U.S vehicle stock.\n\u2014As fewer cars travel more miles, the number of passenger vehicles on American roads will drop from 247 million in 2020 to 44 million in 2030.\n\u2014Global oil demand will peak at 100 million barrels per day by 2020, dropping to 70 million barrels per day by 2030.\nNow, it's been said many times before that predictions are a fools game. After all, few of us were predicting the sudden collapse of the coal industry just a decade ago. But Seba's past predictions on the falling costs of batteries, solar and autonomous vehicle tech have been surprisingly accurate\u2014even slightly conservative. So could Seba and Arbib's vision really come true?\nNow, I've yet to be able to download the report (technical difficulties), so I am working from press release materials. But the key premise appears to be that most conventional predictions for electric vehicle adoption fail to fully factor in the confluence of electric vehicles, autonomous driving technology, and new alternatives to car ownership. When it's cheaper, easier, greener and more fun to hail an autonomous vehicle to get you to your destination, why would you still pay for a giant hulk of metal to sit in your driveway and eat away at your savings?\nIn fact, Seba and Arbib claim that using autonomous, electric vehicles operating under a Transportation as a Service model (think Uber without a driver) will be four to 10 times cheaper per mile than buying a new car, and two to four times cheaper than operating an existing paid-off vehicle, by 2021. That's a pretty compelling difference.\nOf course, it remains to be seen whether our strong cultural and psychological ties to car ownership prove an impediment to such new ways of thinking about mobility. Currently, we seem to be bombarded with conflicting headlines ranging from the arrival of \"Peak Car\" to pickup trucks and SUVs taking over the world. But from anecdotal polling of friends and acquaintances, it does feel like there is a growing hunger for electrified transportation, and a growing openness to transit, ridesharing and other ways of getting about.\n2030 isn't that far off. But it may look very, very different to the world we know today. Let's just hope that we use the coming disruption to rebuild our communities around people\u2014not the (autonomous or"}

Something was created out of nothing! It&apos;s magic! And you&apos;re complaining about some bugs in that creation?\n\"There was a feeling in this country that many IPOs are manipulated,\" U.K. Sinha, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Board of India, said in an interview.\nNote the delicacy of saying \"there was a feeling that IPOs are manipulated,\" which means \"IPOs are volatile,\" versus saying \"IPOs are manipulated,\" which means \"IPOs are manipulated.\" He only said the first one.\nIn September, SEBI proposed a rule that would provide refunds, to investors who apply, for up to 50,000 rupees in IPOs that fall sharply.\nThe refund would be given if the stock fell more than 20% from its issue price within three months of listing, even as the broader market was stable or rising. If the broad market was also falling, the refund would occur if the stock lost 20 percentage points more than the market.\nThe company&apos;s founders, or controlling shareholders, would have to buy the investors&apos; shares back with their own money, without drawing on company funds.\nBankers say the rule, if implemented, could make some companies rethink their plans to sell shares for funds. \"Trying to give some sort of protection...is in principle against the spirit\" of equity markets, said K. Srinivas, founder of Mumbai investment bank Saffron Capital Advisors Pvt.\nBut Mr. Sinha, chairman of the regulator, doesn&apos;t think the rule would have a major impact on the IPO market. The refunds would be capped at 5% of the IPO&apos;s total size, he said. \u2026 \"The basic idea is to force realistic pricing,\" he said.\nYou have some stock in your opaquely valued private company.\nIf Y is above 0.8X, you keep your money.\nFor another more important thing, it doesn&apos;t work because you don&apos;t actually get to decide the price at which you sell shares. The market - sort of - decides, and people don&apos;t want to pay infinity dollars or rupees or anything else for an untested stock.\ntimes (2) 5%-ish for the refund cap!, plus maybe discounted for the credit risk of whether the major shareholders of a busted and/or fraudy company will actually make good on the refund.

After the refund plan, you care to the same degree, plus perhaps five percent. But! Now you&apos;ve got a natural stabilizer on the price, for the first three months anyway.

{"idx": "8192", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In 2003, the city gave promotion exams \u2014 prepared by a firm specializing in employment tests, and approved, as federal law requires, by independent experts \u2014 to 118 candidates, 27 of them black. None of the blacks did well enough to qualify for the 15 immediately available promotions. After a rabble-rousing minister with close ties to the mayor disrupted meetings and warned of dire political consequences if the city promoted persons from the list generated by the exams, the city said: No one will be promoted.\nThe city called this a \u201crace-neutral\u201d outcome because no group was disadvantaged more than any other. So, New Haven\u2019s idea of equal treatment is to equally deny promotions to those who did not earn them and those, including Ricci, who did.\nRicci may be the rock upon which America\u2019s racial spoils system finally founders. He prepared for the 2003 exams by quitting his second job, buying the more than $1,000 worth of books the city recommended, paying to have them read onto audiotapes (he is dyslexic), taking practice tests and submitting to practice interviews. His studying \u2014 sometimes 13 hours a day \u2014 earned him the sixth-highest score on the exam. He and others denied promotions sued, charging violations of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection of the law.\nIn a 1971 case, however, the Supreme Court sowed confusion by holding that the 1964 act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also \u201cpractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\u201d What New Haven ignored is that the court, while proscribing tests that were \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d in having a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on certain preferred minorities, has held that a disparate impact is unlawful only if there is, and the employer refuses to adopt, an equally valid measurement of competence that would have less disparate impact, or if the measurement is not relevant to \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d One of the city\u2019s flimsy excuses for disregarding its exam results was that someone from a rival exam-writing firm said that although he had not read the exam the city used, his company could write a better one.\nNew Haven has not defended its implicit quota system as a remedy for previous discrimination and has not justified it as a way of achieving \u201cdiversity,\u201d which can be a permissible objective for schools\u2019 admissions policies but not in employment decisions. Rather, the city says that it was justified in ignoring the exam results because otherwise it might have faced a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d lawsuit.\nRacial spoils systems must involve incessant mischief because they require a rhetorical fog of euphemisms and blurry categories (e.g., \u201crace-conscious\u201d measures that somehow do not constitute racial discrimination) to obscure stark facts, such as: If Ricci and half a dozen others who earned high scores were not white, the city would have proceeded with the promotions.\nGeorge F.

Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. bought $184 million and $430 million, respectively, well above the estimated $300 million Quebecor initially spent on the spectrum.\nBut it still has a long way to go before it retains full ownership of Quebecor Media once more, a goal it has reiterated over the years.\nThe Caisse and Quebecor got involved in 2000 to execute a $5.4-billion deal to buy Videotron, Quebecor\u2019s telecommunications arm. Telecom now brings in nearly 80 per cent of Quebecor\u2019s revenue and makes the business profitable despite struggles in the media division.\nThe spectrum sale effectively kills Quebecor\u2019s previous plans to expand Videotron\u2019s wireless service outside the province, but analysts say it will reduce its debt-to-earnings ratio enough to buy out the Caisse before its exit rights expire on Jan. 1, 2019.\nIn May, a Quebecor executive told an RBC conference that 100 per cent ownership in Quebecor Media would simplify its corporate structure and remains a priority.\n\u201cWe would not be surprised to see Quebecor acquire the Caisse\u2019s remaining 19 per cent equity interest in Quebecor Media within the next 12 months,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds noted to clients in June after the spectrum transactions, adding he expects it can do so below the target debt range of 4 times debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nQuebecor will likely need to keep some cash for the next spectrum auction, also expected in 2019, McReynolds noted. But he expects that some spectrum will be set aside for it given its status as a regional player. In the last auction, regional players such as Videotron and Wind Mobile (now owned by Shaw and called Freedom Mobile) got an advantage over the Big Three incumbents in a bid to foster a fourth competitor in Canada.\nQuebecor previously repurchased $1.5 billion in shares from the Caisse in 2012 and an additional $500 million in 2015.\nQuebecor Media employs more than 10,000 people in Canada."}

It cracked 10,000 U.S. sales just twice in the past decade and it had a less than memorable appearance. Debuting in Korea in the mid-1980s, the vehicle now known as the Azera has gone by a few other names as well, including the Grandeur, XG and Mitsubishi Debonair.\nThough not the most exciting vehicle on the road, the Hyundai Azera was a fine large sedan during its time.\nIn late 2015, Hyundai took the Genesis name that adorned its flagship premium cars and spun it off into an independent brand that now features the G80 and G90 models. In the gap between the leveled-up Sonata and the bona fide luxury sedans that wear the Genesis badge, there simply isn\u2019t enough of a customer base to justify keeping the Azera on life support in the U.S.\nHowever, it will live on overseas as the Grandeur, sharing a platform with the Hyundai Aslan, Sonata, Kia Cadenza and Optima.\nWhile Hyundai loses one hatchback in the Accent, it gains another with the Elantra GT.\nJoining the Azera on the chopping block is the Accent hatchback, a move that was not explained by the South Korean manufacturer. Maybe it\u2019s choosing to focus more on the all-new Elantra GT or perhaps, like the Elantra, it is simply rolling out the new sedan and five-door versions separately.\nSpeaking of the Elantra, the same package that we saw in 2017 will be carried over into 2018. Same goes for the Tucson and Santa Fe as well as the Ioniq, although Hyundai will debut the previously-announced plug-in hybrid version during the coming year.\nFor U.S. markets, the Kona will offer at least two powertrains: a 2.0-liter engine with 147 horsepower and a six-speed automatic or a turbocharged 1.6-liter with 174 horsepower and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.\nHyundai also is bringing a new subcompact crossover to the U.S., the Kona, which promises entertaining handling to go with its turbocharged engine and its cutesy design. With features such as \u201cUrban Smart Armor,\u201d wireless charging and smartphone connectivity, Hyundai is targeting city-dwelling young buyers with the Kona.\nThe Veloster, Hyundai\u2019s quirky small hatchback, will not get a 2018 package but instead will hold a long 2017 over until a full redesign is released later next year."}

In the end, the Bearcats made one more play in their 20-19 overtime win in Friday\u2019s football opener for both teams.\nQuarterback Edgar Nunez eluded a blitzing linebacker, avoided stepping out of bounds and threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to reliable sophomore receiver Weston Rollwitz for Ballinger\u2019s touchdown in overtime. Nunez added the game-winning extra-point kick to give the Bearcats a 20-13 lead.\nUndaunted despite finishing 0-10 last year, Brady converted a fourth-and-1 on quarterback Walker Bauer\u2019s 1-yard sneak during its overtime possession. Ryan Decker\u2019s 4-yard touchdown run pulled the Bulldogs within 20-19, and second-year head coach Shay Easterwood decided to go for two extra points in an attempt to end Brady\u2019s 14-game losing skid.\nOn the game\u2019s deciding play, Brady scatback Kelton Bernard, who earlier had popped a 46-yard touchdown run, took a handoff on a power lead play from the Wing-T offense. He had an opening, but when Bernard went to cut, he slipped and ended up in the arms of Ballinger linebacker Cooper Bean.\nBallinger, which finished 3-8 last year, survived 20-19 and beat Brady for the 57th time in 88 meetings.\n\u201cI was there. There was no way he was getting into the end zone,\u201d Bean said of Bernard\u2019s conversion attempt.\nEasterwood said his assistant coaches in the press box already were talking about what two-point play to run before the Bulldogs scored to get within 20-19.\n\u201cI told them to hold on, that we hadn\u2019t scored yet. But they just knew we were going to score,\u201d Easterwood said. \u201cWe had a good play called, but Ballinger called a timeout. Based on what we saw them line up in after the time out, we changed the gap that we were going to attack.\nEasterwood\u2019s Bulldogs will have to wait for another Friday night to win their first game since Oct. 14, 2016, when they beat Jim Ned 21-12. That said, Brady is well ahead of last year\u2019s pace, when it had just 32 players and was forced to scrap its JV schedule.\n\u201cWe have 25 players on the varsity this year and 28 on the JV. That\u2019s 22 more than last year. That\u2019s like having a whole other team out there,\u201d Easterwood said.\nThe Bulldogs stopped Bearcats\u2019 quarterback Tyler Vaughn, who was Brady\u2019s quarterback last year, on a fourth-and-goal run from the 1-yard line with 51 seconds left in regulation to preserve the 13-13 tie.\nWith high expectations this season, a win over Brady was almost a must for Ballinger.\nRollwitz caught seven passes for 112 yards for Ballinger while Nunez finished with 172 yards combined rushing and passing.

Contributor Andreas Reiffen says it depends on what you're selling and how much you have to invest.\nTalk in the digital advertising space has traditionally focused on Google and Facebook\u2019s digital duopoly, each fighting for more of your advertising dollars. But for Google, the real competition is coming from elsewhere.\nOver the last few years, Google has pushed further and further into the retail space. Simultaneously, Amazon expanded its advertising platform. In the end, they both want the same thing: your purchase intent.\nAs these two tech behemoths continue to get more and more similar, who will lead? And more importantly, what should you do about it?\nWe\u2019re used to thinking of Google as a search engine. For advertisers, Google\u2019s search engine results page (SERP) is composed of text and product (Google Shopping) ads. The popularity of these product ads with digital marketers has grown in popularity. According to Adobe\u2019s Digital Index, spend on Google Shopping has surpassed that of text ads in every market.\nThis is especially true when it comes to mobile ad spend, for which, in our clients\u2019 experience, Google Shopping is far more profitable. In the UK, for example, they spend around 74 percent of their mobile ad budget on shopping ads.\nDue to the popularity and success of its shopping ads, Google has made a significant investment in their placement and prominence. The search giant\u2019s rationale appears to be that product ads are more attractive to users, generating more revenue for retailers (and thus themselves).\nIt then threw a \u201cpurchase on Google\u201d option into the mix. This allows shoppers to complete their purchase without ever leaving the Google interface. Google also started surfacing product ads for super generic search terms. This indicates that it wants to own the browsing aspect of online shopping, in addition to the purchase.\nSo, what is the net result? As Google has continued to experiment with ever larger and more prominent placements for its product ads, the product SERP has taken on a startling resemblance to an Amazon results page.\nThe two business models look set for a collision course. With the addition of a buy button, Google is attempting to become a retail marketplace. Amazon, on the other hand, has been expanding its sponsored product ads offering, which looks increasingly like an advertising platform.\nEven more telling, Google just announced what it calls Shopping Actions and Google Express.\nShopping Actions allows users to create a universal shopping cart of items from multiple retailers. Once they have a full cart, shoppers then use a Google-hosted checkout service to pay for all items at one time. Google Express is their new foray into last-minute delivery. This is undoubtedly Google taking another swipe at Amazon and other large retailers\u2019 market.\nBoth Amazon and Google have invested in logistics, too, although with an important difference.\nWith its recent leasing of 40 cargo planes and a $1.5 billion investment in a cargo hub to keep them, Amazon is opting to own logistics from end to end. It has also invested heavily in delivery technology with a fleet of drones and a doorbell that grants the delivery man access to your house.\nGoogle is comparatively late to the logistics game, but it\u2019s certainly making up for lost time. Under its holdings firm, Alphabet, it has purchased no fewer than eight robotics companies in the last few years.\nOwning self-driving pioneer Waymo puts Google among the strongest players in the driverless car industry.

A weak civil society supports authoritarian rule, which keeps society weak.\"\n(February 12, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) The Citizen's Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) is one of the few civil society organisations in Sri Lanka which has consistently stood up for civil rights and good governance in our country. Earlier this week, CIMOGG sponsored a public lecture by Jayantha Dhanapala at the auditorium of the Organisation of Professional Associations on energising the civil society in Sri Lanka. In his lecture, Dhanapala contended that civil society had an important role to play but was not doing enough, even though there were mechanisms available that allowed for civil society to intervene in promoting good governance.\nDhanapala argued that Sri Lanka had traditionally been a closely integrated society with inbuilt social security systems that helped less fortunate relatives and friends. A bereavement in a neighbour\u2019s family, the financial distress of a friend or accommodation for a poor or elderly relative met with spontaneously generous responses even among the poorest. Our society\u2019s responses to the tsunami and now to the floods have been exemplary. Likewise the concept of shramadana and voluntary work in public projects has been a traditional feature embedded in our culture for centuries. It is but a step from this charitable concern for our fellow citizens and constructive community action to civic, non-partisan involvement in issues that impact on the welfare of our society as a whole and our rights as citizens.\nDhanapala then went on to examine what he thought were the reasons for the civil society not being more effective in the good governance of our country. He thought the reason lay firstly, in the confusion between non-governmental-organizations or NGOs and civil society. Secondly, there was a conviction that civil society and NGOs are both concepts imported from the West and financed by foreign sources which invariably work against the sovereignty of our country and our national interest. Thirdly, there was such a heavy politicization of society over six decades of the practice of partisan politics that every participant in public life and every opinion expressed is viewed through the prism of party politics. We no longer appreciate the fact that honest men and women can disagree and that dissent is a necessary feature in democratic society. Successive governments have adopted the posture that \"If you are not for us; you are against us\".\nDhanapala then went to expand on the mechanisms that were available to the civil society to intervene to ensure good governance \u2013 the Ombudsman, the Parliamentary Committee for High Posts and public interest litigation. But this columnist is not convinced that these mechanisms provide effective protection of democratic rights and liberties. As far as the Ombudsman is concerned, we are aware that certain individual cases of injustice have been redressed by appeal to the Ombudsman. But it seems unlikely that the Ombudsman will be able to put right general abuse of power by individuals and agencies of the political establishment. It also appears that the Parliamentary Committee for High Posts is largely ineffective and/or non-functional. Public interest litigation is costly and probably will prove ineffective in the current highly politicised environment. Dhanapala hints at the more effective role that has been played and could be played by organisations like the Civil Rights Movement, which since "}

Even just walking down the stairs on a cold night brings a sense of warmth, as if heading toward the hot magma at the center of the Earth is a better idea than hanging out near that frozen precipitation on the surface.\nThen you get inside \u201cThe Parlor,\u201d as it\u2019s known, and the heat from the fireplace \u2013 yep, that\u2019s real wood \u2013 lets you know you\u2019ve arrived at the right place. Sure, the room is dark and windowless, but that\u2019s part of the appeal when it\u2019s dark and gloomy outside.\nPick a favorite from the generous and creative tap list (an appealing concoction from Hill Farmstead Brewery is almost always on tap), settle at one of the vinyl-upholstered booths or on a firm pew-like bench and then find out when closing time is, because you\u2019re probably going to want to be there for the duration.\nAhh, another fireplace, and though the compact space near the corner of College and Church streets is at ground-level, the dark-wood-and-leather motif makes it seem as snug as the basement at The Farmhouse.\nThe Whiskey Room feels like a Victorian drawing room, made even homier by the books (all about whiskey and other libations, naturally) on the fireplace mantel. There are a few well-chosen beers on tap \u2013 on a recent afternoon a coffee porter from Farnham Ale & Lager in South Burlington brought its own warmth to the scene \u2013 but the name of the establishment is all you need to know about its raison d\u2019etre.\nWhiskey fans who walk in and catch a glimpse of the bundle of bottles behind the bar might just feel like they\u2019ve been transported to Ireland. The only thing that might make The Whiskey Room more Celtic would be if the fireplace burned peat instead of gas.\nThis is the Rookie of the Year as far as cozy Burlington bars go. The first Bangkok Bistro on the Church Street Marketplace closed years ago but was reopened last year by the son of the original owners.\nThe compact restaurant serves Thai specialties, but Bangkok Bistro 1.0 and 2.0 both built their reputations in large part on a long list of specialty drinks. And if you\u2019re going to specialize in specialty drinks, you\u2019d better have a special bar to go with it. The blond-wood bar illuminated by blue and white lighting pulls off being cool and warm all at the same time.\nMaybe the coziest aspect of Bangkok Bistro is its location at the corner of an alley off Church and College streets near Red Square. No cars and minimal foot traffic bring a unique urban-oasis feel to Bangkok Bistro.\nYep, it\u2019s a club (of the music variety, affiliated with neighboring Duino Duende restaurant and Radio Bean coffee shop/bar/music venue). It\u2019s also a lamp shop with a variety of antique-ish fixtures for sale.

Windows 7 officially falls off support on 14 January 2020.\nHe also said that users would be able to reject future notifications by selecting a \"do not notify me again\" option and that it would include a \"learn more\" button. Both echoed a nag Microsoft slapped on the screens of Windows XP users five years ago when that OS was nearing its end of support.\nThe Windows 7 notices will appear eight months earlier than those XP warnings. Only in March 2014, just a month before XP's expiration, did Microsoft begin placing on-screen reminders of the impending date.\nThe Windows XP proclamations were issued monthly. If Microsoft uses the same schedule and cadence, it will first push the notices to Windows 7 on 14 April, then repeat them on the 14th of each subsequent month.\nBased on Microsoft's moves around XP, Computerworld had predicted December as the nags' likely debut. Instead, Microsoft jumped the gun.\nThe accelerated schedule may be due to Windows 7's continued strength. According to Computerworld's latest forecast, which relies on data from analytics company Net Applications, Windows 7 will power more than 40 per cent of all Windows personal computers at the end of January 2020.\nIf accurate, that number would be significantly higher - about 35 per cent higher - than the portion of all Windows PCs that ran XP soon after it reached support retirement.\nMicrosoft may hope that by posting nags earlier, it will reduce the larger fraction of Windows 7 systems before support ends.\nFive years ago, Microsoft pushed the on-screen alerts only to systems maintained using Windows Update, the stock consumer and small business service.\nWindows 7 PCs managed by enterprise IT staff using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) were not fed the nag. Administrators were also able to remove and/or prevent the warning by modifying the Windows registry or setting a group policy.\nIt's almost certain that similar options will exist for the Windows 7 notice."}

I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana\u2019s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward.\nI recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back. I can\u2019t remember what the sermon was about, but I remember these words of Saint Paul. Because what I heard that morning was an invitation to put the shame of my failure and anger behind me. That a saint had done the same, and so could I.\nI didn\u2019t listen to the rest of the message, what I heard was a personal, motivational message much like I\u2019d heard for years from my swimming coach. Because in that moment, where I was spiritually in my walk with God, that is all I could hear.\nThat I can so clearly recall it all these years later reveals its impact on me. In the years to come, I would recall these verses or look them up in the Bible more than once to remind myself that the past was the past and I was moving forward.\nI recently wrote about how comparing ourselves to others can keep us from focusing on God\u2019s purpose for our lives. In the same way, if we are looking over our shoulder at where we\u2019ve been we slow our progress forward. True. But, that\u2019s a message any motivational speaker with no spiritual inclination could provide.\nSaint Paul is calling us toward a higher goal. What I didn\u2019t see then, (and which is beautifully clarified in the translation found in the message) is this: \u201cSo let\u2019s keep focused on that goal, those of us who want everything God has for us.\u201d That is the point I missed 20 years ago. My perspective then was to forget the past so that I could focus on my goals for my future. Laudable, yes.\nBut Saint Paul stresses that our future success is exponentially greater when we focus, without wavering, on God\u2019s plan for our future. God\u2019s plan is always greater than anything we can imagine for ourselves. Our vision of what we are capable of is limited by what we have seen ourselves accomplish in the past. We lack God\u2019s creative and infinite perspective. Our horizons are broader when we give our work to God. This is accomplished by daily seeking God\u2019s will through prayer and reading our Bible.\nWhen I was a competitive swimmer, I had to practice daily, then race in a swim meet, and after evaluating my performance, my coach and I made changes to my training. Any business owner will tell you that they are focused daily on not only perfecting their goods or services, but calibrating the market\u2019s reaction, and adjusting their business plan.\nSuzanne Elizabeth Anderson is the author of \u201cA Map of Heaven.\u201d She lives in Breckenridge.

{"idx": "8219", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan may be in a better spot today than it was this time last year, but that doesn't mean it's a risk-free investment.\nPipeline giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) had a rough ending to 2015, shedding more than half of its market value between the middle of October and the end of December. The driver behind that decline was Moody's warning of a potential debt downgrade that would have moved Kinder Morgan's debt into \"junk bond\" territory. That move would have likely significantly increased the costs of financing -- or even restricted Kinder Morgan's ability to refinance existing debt or take on new debt in order to continue its expansion plans.\nIn response, Kinder Morgan cut its dividend, scaled back its expansion plans, and pledged to reduce its need to access the capital market. While that was a prudent move to protect the company from the damaging blow of a debt downgrade to junk status, it upset shareholders who had come to expect both a high and increasing dividend. While those changes made today's Kinder Morgan less risky than it was this time last year, the company still faces risks that could make its stock fall again.\nKinder Morgan is currently the largest energy infrastructure company in North America, but it is at substantial risk of losing that title in the not-too-distant future: Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is in the process of merging with Spectra Energy (NYSE:SE) in a deal that could make that combined company North America's largest.\nScale is important in the energy infrastructure business, given the heavy investments needed in securing rights, building, operating, and maintaining pipelines, terminals, and other similar equipment. That makes the emergence of the combined Enbridge and Spectra business a substantial shift in the competitive landscape. In addition, as Enbridge is based in Canada and Spectra is based in the United States, the combined company may have a better chance of getting cross-border projects approved.\nPrior to last year's Moody's downgrade threat, Kinder Morgan identified a five-year growth plan of over $21 billion worth of investments. In a more recent presentation -- after its access to the debt market was curtailed by Moody's concern for its existing leverage -- that five-year plan was down to $13.5 billion. With its ability to tap the financing market reduced, fewer projects look economically attractive, thus lowering the company's potential growth rate.\nAs stocks are valued based on their expected future cash flows, less potential growth translates directly to a lower fair value estimate for a company. While Kinder Morgan's current share price is substantially below its year-ago level, any further cuts to its growth estimates driven by financing or other concerns could cause its shares to drop further.\nKinder Morgan currently carries almost $42 billion in debt on its balance sheet. All of that debt is either floating-rate debt -- and thus directly exposed to rising interest rates -- or fixed-rate debt, in which case it's exposed to interest-rate risk at the time it matures. After all, when debt matures, a company can either pay it off (if it has cash available) or refinance it at the then-prevailing interest rates.\nIf Kinder Morgan pays off its maturing debt, it reduces the cash it has available for additional expansion projects. If it refinances the maturing debt in a time of higher interest rates, it has to pay more in interest on the same amount of outstanding loans, thus reducing the cash flow available to cover operations and expansion. Either way, rising rates translates to less cash available for a company that carries debt, which would complicate the"}

But these are forecasts you don\u2019t need to take with a grain of salt.\nSo for this episode of Motley Fool Answers, hosts Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp discuss the sorts of pundits and predictions you're best off ignoring and why, then offer up a handful of forecasts that are less than risky, but that are nonetheless valuable for retail investors.\nAlison Southwick: Hey, Bro! Happy New Year!\nRobert Brokamp: Happy New Year to you, too!\nSouthwick: At the time of taping this, things in the world, I would say, are a bit unstable. The markets are unstable. The economy is...I don't know. Does anyone ever really know?\nBrokamp: That's a good point.\nBrokamp: But here's the problem. Much of investing and financial planning does rely on a little bit of knowledge, in fact, a little bit of foreknowledge -- in fact, you have to basically make a prediction. When you're buying one stock vs. the thousands of others, you are predicting that that is going to be the better investment. You're deciding to put a little bit more in international or U.S. stocks. You're trying to make a prediction of which is going to be the better bet. The whole point of retirement planning is doing something so that when that time comes, 10, 20, 30 years from now, you're going to have enough money. So you have to make some predictions.\nThere's a problem. That is, humans stink at predictions. I find it interesting. I'm a bit of a collector of predictions. I even have a folder in my Evernote, because partially I want to see who's particularly good at predictions, partially because when people make predictions, they have some interesting points to make in supporting the predictions. But the bottom line is, generally, people aren't very good at it.\nOne of my favorite examples I think I've used on the show before was one of those end-of-the-year articles in Businessweek. It was the end of 2007. They asked six highly paid, finely attired Wall Street types how they thought the Dow would end in 2008. At that point, the Dow was a little over 13,000. Every single one of these people expected the Dow to go up to about an average of 15,000. What happened in 2008?\nBrokamp: Not good. It dropped to about 8,000. Forty percent drop. Worst year for the stock market since the Great Depression. It's one of those glaring examples of how you have people who have all the resources that you supposedly could ask for to make these predictions, and they all got it wrong.\nThere are plenty of studies that have looked over bigger periods of time. One is a study that was done by CXO Advisory, they call it their Guru Grades. What they did from 2005 to 2012, they collected 6,582 forecasts about the U.S. stock market from 68 experts. They didn't even just look at the predictions from that time period, they went back to their archives. The oldest prediction went back as far as 1998. What was the average guru accuracy?\nBrokamp: A little worse than a coin flip. The most accurate person was right 68% of the time. Still wrong one out of every three"}

{"idx": "8227", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: On Sunday the vast bulk of Israel''s media was about Syria.\nBy Tuesday, it had shifted to the budget that Finance Minister Yair Lapid would present to the government.\nThe background was a sizable deficit in the budgets of recent years, and a greater deficit projected for the present year if there would be no cuts in spending and/or increases in income. One of the international bond agencies reduced Israel''s credit rating.\nExplanations for the problem touched on the many elements in government activities, plus the national and international economic trends that affected Israel''s obligations, employment, imports and exports. Prominent were increases in salaries during recent years, and a surge in defense spending prompted by the Iranian nuclear threat.\nYair Lapid brought his new political party (There is a Future) to power by promising to ease the burdens of Israel''s working middle class. By that he meant Israelis who work, support themselves, and pay taxes, as opposed to the growing ultra-Orthodox population that lives off the economic activity of others.\nThe \"middle class\" is not something defined with precision. It amounts, more or less, to the population with monthly incomes (after taxes) in the range of \u20aa10,000 - \u20aa30,000, which translates to US $2,800 - $8,300. That population already paid income tax rates from 35 to 50 percent, with a value added tax of 17 percent on almost all purchases, special taxes on gasoline, automobiles, and other large items, as well as local property taxes, alcohol and cigarette taxes.\nLapid announced increases in taxes on income and value added taxes, the extension of the value added tax to hotel bills and other expenditures of tourists, higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco, the purchase of apartments, with yet higher taxes on high end cars and apartments, as well as a number of cuts in outlays. Monthly payments for children under the age of 18 would be reduced, and would be the same amount for each child. This would eliminate the progressively higher payments per child for large families, which added to the incomes of ultra-Orthodox.as well as Arab families. He would also cut sharply the payments to religious schools that did not teach a basic program of mathematics and language along with their religious studies. Other reductions would be made in outlays for just about every sector of the government budget. Lapid would cut into the pension benefits of military personnel along with other parts of the defense budget, outlays in the field of transportation that would delay plans for new roads and rail lines, reduce subsidies for medicines, and payments for children\u2019s dental care. He would adjust schedules for subsidized mortgages in order to favor families that worked and had served in the military and reduce the advantages that had been enjoyed by families of yeshiva students, and reduce subsidies for child care that were put into effect in response to social protests during the summer of 2011..\nIt did not take long for opposition politicians to accuse Lapid of violating his pledges to help the middle class. Advocates for activities subject to more taxes and less outlays have lamented the damages to be caused. People associated with hotels have argued that imposing a value added tax on tourists'' expenditures would cut into the flow of visitors, cause unemployment throughout their sector, as well as in all the activities supported by the purchases of individuals working in tourism.\nThe cartoon in Ha''artz shows a sweating Lapid at his computer, while his secretary announces a phone call from Ricky.

He pretended to be a white supremacist . . . on the phone. That isn\u2019t infiltration, that\u2019s prank-calling. A poster for the movie shows a black guy wearing a Klan hood. Great starting point for a comedy, but it didn\u2019t happen. The cop who actually attended KKK meetings undercover was a white guy (played by Adam Driver). These led . . . well, nowhere in particular. No plot was foiled. Those meetups mainly revealed that Klansmen behave exactly how you\u2019d expect Klansmen to behave.\nBut! BlacKkKlansman keeps getting called spot-on, and (as Quentin Tarantino showed in Django Unchained) the moronic nature of the Klan and its beliefs makes it an excellent target for comedy. Lee doesn\u2019t exactly wield an \u00e9p\u00e9e as a satirist, though: His idea of a top joke is having the redneck Klansman think \u201cgooder\u201d is a word. Most of the movie isn\u2019t even attempted comedy.\nLee\u2019s principal achievement here is in showcasing the talents of John David Washington, in the first of what promise to be many starring roles in movies. Washington (son of Denzel) has an easygoing charisma as the unflappable Ron Stallworth, a rookie cop in Colorado Springs who volunteers to go undercover as a detective in 1972, near the height of the Black Power movement and a moment when law enforcement was closely tracking the activities of radicals such as Stokely Carmichael, a.k.a. Kwame Ture, a speech of whose Stallworth says he attended while posing as an ordinary citizen. In the movie, Stallworth experiences an awakening of black pride and falls for a student leader, Patrice (a luminous Laura Harrier, who also played Peter Parker\u2019s girlfriend in Spider-Man: Homecoming), inspiring in him the need to do something for his people. He dismisses Carmichael\u2019s call for armed revolution as mere grandstanding, really just a means for drawing black people together. After the speech, the audience goes to a party instead of a riot.\nThe Klan also turn out to be grandstanders and blowhards given to Carmichael-style paranoid prophecies and seem to hope to troll their enemies into attacking them. When Lee realizes he needs something to actually happen besides racist talk, he turns to a subplot featuring a white-supremacist lady running around with a purse full of C-4 explosive with which she intends to blow up the black radicals. It\u2019s so unconvincing that you watch it thinking, \u201cI really doubt this happened.\u201d It didn\u2019t. The only other tense moment in the film, in which Driver\u2019s undercover cop (who is Jewish) is nearly subjected to a lie-detector test about his religion by a suspicious Klansman, is also fabricated.\nLee frames his two camps as opposites, but whether we\u2019re with the black-power types or the white-power yokels, they\u2019re equally wrong about the race war they seem to yearn for. The two sides are equally far from the stable center, the"}

But they say their vision would also mean a much cheaper price tag for the city.\nCraft chief executive officer Peter Griffis said he plans to have a development application \"formalized and ready to go\" for the site by the end of November, despite the city's intention to rezone the entire area for a park. He warned the battle would end up at the Ontario Municipal Board.\n\"I am quite comfortable \u2026 with my position. The city is going to do what they want. This is political, that you can see,\" Mr. Griffis said in an interview.\nToronto City Council, which is meeting on Wednesday, is set to debate whether to spend $2.4-million studying how to pull off Mr. Tory's plan to bring 8.5 hectares of parkland to park-starved downtown condo-dwellers by building a platform over the railways that cut across the city's centre. Craft's alternative plan is expected to gain some traction with some councillors who question the expensive rail-deck plan.\nThe city's chief planner, Jennifer Keesmaat, has previously dismissed the alternative plans, saying a win for the city in any OMB battle would be a \"no-brainer.\" Ms. Keesmaat also told The Globe last month that the city had no confirmation the developers had even purchased the air rights from the railways.\nTo address this claim, Mr. Griffis instructed his lawyers to send The Globe two short letters provided to city planners and dated Sept. 15. One is from a lawyer for Craft, the other from a lawyer for Canadian National Railway Co. and the Toronto Terminals Railway Co. Ltd., the company co-owned by CN and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. that controls the tracks around Union Station.\nThe letters say that Craft entered into a \"binding and enforceable\" agreement of purchase and sale in 2013 for \"air space above the rail, south of Front Street West, between Bathurst Street and Blue Jays Way.\"\nThe letters do not say if the deal has closed. The letters also do not say whether the deal is conditional on the land actually being zoned for development or for a certain density \u2013 a common clause in such deals. Mr. Griffis would not reveal any other details on Tuesday. Mr. Sweeny said the deal had not yet closed.\nLocal city councillor Joe Cressy, a booster of the city's rail-deck park concept, said he and city staff had seen those letters but that they lack necessary details. The developers themselves, he said, told him when they met earlier this year that the deal was \"conditional.\" Regardless, he said, the city will still need to discuss terms with whoever actually holds the air rights as it proceeds with its plans to build the park.\n\"There are developers who have different visions of the rail corridor than Mayor Tory and I,\" Mr. Cressy said. \"Rather than a park, they would like to see more condo towers. However, the mayor and I are determined to build a new park.\""}

The week prior to this gathering at Mercedes-Benz global design headquarters in Sindelfingen, he fell off a horse. That same week, one of his employer\u2019s bigger sponsorship properties, the top-ranked German national football team, suffered an ignominious and early ouster from the World Cup.\nWagener knows stress. For the past decade, he has been personally responsible for the design direction of all four of the Mercedes-Benz brands: Mercedes-Benz itself, AMG, the EQ electric group and Maybach. They are required to be distinct, and yet interrelated.\n\u201cThe complexity of product design has increased by a factor of 100,\u201d says the design chief, referencing the speed of change in the industry over the past 10 to 15 years.\nWhen you consider that Daimler AG is the 13th-largest car manufacturer in the world and the most prolific producer of trucks, there\u2019s no small amount of responsibility on Wagener\u2019s shoulders. He must keep his eye trained on an exhaustive range of vehicles, from the smart fortwo to the Freightliner Cascadia.\nOn this day, Wagener presents his team\u2019s approach to the four Mercedes-Benz sub-brands. There is no equivalent challenge in the automotive industry. Other groups may be responsible for a collection of individual brands. For example, FCA produces everything from the Ferrari 812 Superfast to the Chrysler Pacifica. The VW Group encompasses the likes of Audi, Bugatti and Lamborghini. These are different brands with different logos and unique histories.\nBut no other manufacturer is attempting to market four different sub-brands, all bearing the same logo. To better understand their approach \u2013 and to help fill in the gaps created when Wagener leaves early to continue the healing process \u2013 attendees receive a hardcover book, authored by the man himself, entitled \"Global Design Travel Log.\u201d Inside, there are images of Wagener visiting his charges in the 11 different Daimler AG design centres around the world.\nThis philosophy places the four Mercedes-Benz sub-brands on a sliding scale of brand aesthetic hotness, if you will.\nThe high-performance AMG spin-off is on the steamiest side of things, followed by the Maybach line; the Mercedes-Benz sub-brand ventures towards a cooler climate, while the forthcoming EQ electric is rooted in the cool shade. But there is a commonality that links all four together: a focus on luxury, whether it be performance-based, modern or progressive.\nThe design approach for the mother brand, Mercedes-Benz, may be the most difficult challenge. It\u2019s the brand that sets the stage for the others to follow, and, indeed, the AMG and Maybach lines include spinoffs of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, amped up to 11 in terms of performance and/or luxury.\nThe focus for the main brand is what the design gurus call \u201ctimeless luxury,\u201d characterized by technology and craftsmanship working in harmony.

The greater the secrecy and the accompanying lies, the more vital becomes the role of whistleblowers and the more vindictive becomes the state in its pursuit of them.\nWhistleblowers are people who start out as loyal servants of the state. Their illusions about the state\u2019s supposed moral agenda and the wholeheartedness of their own patriotic commitment make them all the more shocked when they discover evidence of the state\u2019s wrongdoing.\nPoster in support of Pvt. Bradley Manning, posted in Washington D.C.\u2019s Metro system.\nGiven the extreme concentration of weaponry (as well as surveillance capabilities) in the hands of the state, and given the disposition of the state to apply such resources even against nonviolent mass movements, the type of defection practiced by whistleblowers an option available to military and intelligence operatives at all levels is crucial to any eventual triumph of popular forces over the ruling class.\nWhistleblowers thus not only embarrass the government, disrupt its policies, and (assuming adequate diffusion) educate the citizenry; they also are harbingers of a broader crumbling of the capitalist state and the order it defends. Acting largely in isolation and at great risk to themselves, they embody the conviction or at least the hope that basic decency has a more universal grounding than does any possible scheme of oppression.\nWhistleblowing\u2019s principal near-term function is educational. It demonstrates the undemocratic character of the regime whose secrets it lets out; it is thus an essential ingredient of investigative journalism. The documents it brings to light reach the public through those who practice such journalism, whom the government then threatens with prosecution unless they disclose their sources.\nThe novelty of Wikileaks is that it provided a new form of protection for the anonymity of sources. This, together with the facility of electronic transmission, has made the potential for disclosure greater than ever before. It accounts for the extraordinary fact that the U.S. government has been pursuing draconian charges against someone who not merely is only the recipient rather than the \u201cleaker\u201d of sensitive information, but someone who is not even a citizen or resident of the United States Julian Assange.\nDisclosure is particularly embarrassing when it documents the fact that government officials have lied. The Director of Central Intelligence lied under oath to the U.S. Congress a felony for which he was never prosecuted when he denied that the National Security Agency monitors the communications of the entire U.S. population.\nThis lie was the culminating event in Edward Snowden\u2019s decision to blow the whistle. As we all know, of course, it is Snowden who was then criminalized by the government. This parallels the experience of John Kiriakou, who publicly confirmed, on the basis of his first-hand knowledge, that the CIA practiced torture by waterboarding. Kiriakou then became the only government official to be prosecuted and imprisoned in connection with CIA and military practices of torture.\nThe debate over whistleblowers reached tens of millions of viewers when the presidential candidates of the Democratic Party were asked (on Oct. 13) their views about Snowden.

I especially remember when the Danish veteran, Anders Hansen, was recalling his first sight of McIlroy during the British Masters of 2007. How everything about golf seemed to come so naturally to 'this curly haired kid', that Hansen immediately sensed he was observing someone special.\nSpeaking in Dubai in 2012, the then 42-year-old added: \"What makes Rory even more admirable is that he's one of the nicest guys out here.

I can't think of anyone who comes close.\"\nThose words came back to me today at Portstewart, where McIlroy gave his traditional, eve-of-tournament press conference. In stark contrast to the growing list of players who view such an exercise as a major pain in the neck, McIlroy embraced it not simply in the manner of a polished professional, but as an entirely natural human being.\nHis general demeanour spoke of a total acceptance of broadcasters and journalists with a job to do. And as the championship's host, he carried a certain responsibility to send everyone away in a positive mood.\nOn the other hand, the notion of a conference as an unwanted trial, was frequently evident in the non-communicative responses from other important participants. And you could almost hear the grumbling from scribes who knew, before a word was spoken, that this was going to be a total waste of time.\nWhich goes some way towards explaining the open hostility among the media towards Tiger Woods, when his life began to fall apart in late November 2009.

College coaches are right there with them intently watching.\nTheir performances have regularly vaulted the state's homegrown talent into the top 100 of recruiting site rankings in their respective classes.\nRice Lake's Henry Ellenson. Sam Dekker (Sheboygan Lutheran). Diamond Stone (Dominican). Kevon Looney (Milwaukee Hamilton). Sam Hauser (SPASH).\nAll of them were considered top 100 recruits as seniors. All of them garnered interest from Division I high major college basketball programs.\nA year ago, Wisconsin was home to five recruits of Division I high major talent.\nWhitnall's Tyler Herro decommitted from Wisconsin and wound up at Kentucky. Marquette landed Joey Hauser, who missed his senior season with an ankle injury.\nPlayer of the year Jordan McCabe of Kaukauna took his talents to West Virginia. Oshkosh North's Tyrese Haliburton is off to a nice start at Iowa State. John Diener from Cedarburg ended up at DePaul.\nWhile the Class of 2018 may have been an outlier, there is no denying Wisconsin has become a destination for the top college programs and coaches in the country.\n\"At this point, (Wisconsin) has three guys nationally ranked. I don\u2019t remember three guys ranked so highly.

Bernard, Levi Lusko and Ken Claytor talk about race and culture and what churches should be doing.\nCategory Killer may be Pastor John Gray's new nickname.\nIt's because of Gray's work in bridging divides, work that includes going to places where people haven't seen a lot of diversity, said Pastor Steven Furtick, who gave his friend the new nickname during a racial healing event at Gray's Relentless Church in Greenville on Wednesday.\n\"God has used you to break barriers,\" said Furtick, lead pastor of Elevation Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe conversation was recorded and will be released as a movie in theaters across the country, possibly early next year.\nGray said he always looks to make himself personally uncomfortable, because it leads to growth. One way to grow, and to be uncomfortable, is to charge head-on into differences like when he signed onto work with the Rev. Joel Osteen or when he seeks out the whitest churches possible, such as Pastor Levi Lusko's Montana church.\n\"I know I've been places where I'm the first black man they've hugged,\" Gray said.\nLusko, one of the panelists, said his church recently uncovered World War II era advertisements while renovating, one of the ads promoted a KKK gathering at the former theater where he now leads worship services.\nBringing Gray to speak on a stage where hatred once reigned is one of those small steps, he said.\nHealing racial problems in the country will require people to meet more people, to do hard and slow work to build bridges, Lusko said.\nBuilding the Brooklyn Bridge took years and cost lives and treasure but it was overbuilt before the era of cars and can now handle the biggest SUVs. So too should churches overbuild the bridges between race, cultures, wealth and other differences, Lusko said.\nGray launched The Bridge on Wednesday, a new program that he hopes will continue conversations about race, culture and politics with the church at the front.\n\"Tonight our nation gets what I believe is the beginning of something I think will change the nation,\" Gray said. \"It's time for the church to have a necessary, uncomfortable conversation.\"\nChurches have not been intentional about growing diversity and good intentions have not led to a big enough change in what the Rev. Martin Luther King called the most segregated hour of the week, church on Sundays, Gray said.\nIt won't be easy, said Pastor Ken Claytor, of Alive Church in Gainsville, Florida.\nHe took over as pastor with a church that was 99 percent black and it took years of deliberate work, inviting people into his figurative and sometimes literal refrigerator, to get the church to a mix of people that reflects heaven's diversity.\n\"Diversity takes effort,\" Claytor said.\nIt's worth the effort because the nation is hurting right now and churches need to step up, Gray said.\nThe pastor has landed in Greenville by God's will and talking frankly about race will help expose racism for the evil it is, said Prophetess Sandra Campbell, who attends Redemption.\nThe church feels like what heaven should feel like, said Tiffany Mashburn, who has been attending the church since 2010, when it was called Redemption Church before Gray assumed the pastor's role in May.\n\"You tend to hear a lot of time that people go to the church that pre"}

{"idx": "8260", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Information technology managers claim said a denial-of-service vulnerability that affects some Wi-Fi wireless LANs could force companies to develop new skills and rethink the way their networks are set up. But, they added, it should be relatively easy to defend WLANs against attacks seeking to exploit the flaw.\nFor example, an attacker would need to be within the typical 200- to 300-ft. range of a WLAN to shut down data transmissions, according to security researchers and wireless vendors. Corporate WLANs that are well shielded within buildings or fenced-off areas should be safe from attacks, they said.\nCompanies that operate multiple access points on their WLANs could also switch network traffic to other access points if one or more were attacked, although doing so would require radio frequency management skills and tools.\nThe denial-of-service risks were outlined on May 13 by the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team and amplified by its U.S. counterpart. The problem affects WLANs based on the 802.11b protocol, as well as the original 802.11 protocol and low-speed 802.11g wireless devices operating at rates below 20Mbit/sec., the two groups said.\nThey added that networks built around 802.11a or high-speed 802.11g technology aren't affected by the vulnerability, which involves an access-control function used by WLANs that support the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) modulation scheme. No technology fix is available, so users must take other steps to protect their networks from attacks.\nMike Taylor, CIO at Todd Shipyards Corp. in Seattle, said he thinks geography serves as his best defense. Todd Shipyards runs its WLAN over 40 access points spread across its 44-acre shipyard, Taylor said. That means attackers would have to surround the shipyard and then try to take out every one of its widely scattered access points to stop traffic, he added.\nGeography also works in FedEx's favor, said Ken Pasley, director of wireless business development at the Memphis-based company.\nFedEx runs extensive WLANs at its package-delivery hubs to connect wireless bar-code scanners used in package sorting. But the hubs are located within the fenced periphery of airports, which should make it difficult for an attacker to get within range, Pasley said.\nFedEx also uses radio frequency scanning tools in an effort to detect potential attacks and protect its wireless networks, Pasley said.\nThe flaw was discovered by a team of graduate students at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. Mark Looi, a professor there, suggested that one defense against attacks would be to replace all 802.11b access points with 802.11a technology, which uses a different form of modulation than DSSS.\nBut a spokeswoman for United Parcel Service Inc., which operates one of the largest 802.11b networks in the world, said the Atlanta-based company views a move to 802.11a as unacceptable because of the money it has invested in its existing WLAN deployment. She added that UPS is waiting for input from its WLAN vendor, Symbol Technologies Inc., on safeguarding its network."}

The Prague Regional Court also ordered the forfeiture of some 22 million crowns, which the police seized from him.\nRath, who pleads innocent, appealed the verdict.\nLN writes that Rath is now considering running in the autumn election to one-third of the Senate, the upper house of parliament, most likely for the Bloc of Jana Bobosikova, a former MEP.

In recent days, Putin has signaled that after his constitutionally limited second term ends next year, he may become prime minister, effectively holding onto power and dashing hopes for any real transition. Putin also lectured two Bush Cabinet secretaries about U.S. missile defense plans, then headed for Iran, where he offered support for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his struggle with Bush over Tehran's nuclear program.\nPutin's actions prompted Sen.

He also said that higher salaries could only be achieved through \"continuous economic growth and some cost-saving measures\".\nAccording to the TASR news agency, more than 1,000 doctors came to the meeting with Dzurinda.\nThe PM said he was aware of the situation in health care but was unable to help doctors and nurses in their dissatisfaction with their wages.\nDzurinda said the protesters should have raised their voices earlier when the country's state budget was being prepared, a statement that drew loud booing from the crowd.\nAt the end of the meeting, some doctors even threw their gowns at the stage where the PM was sitting to show their discontent with his message.\nDoctors and other medical staff are demanding a 20-25 percent wage rise after five years of no increases.\nState authorities insist that health care employees must negotiate wage increases with their respective hospital directors rather than with the Health Ministry or the government."}

{"idx": "8280", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Vida Movahed, pictured lifting her head scarf into the air on Tehran\u2019s Enghelab Street, is credited with sparking a wave of protests in Iran against the compulsory wearing of the hijab.\nIt was the quietest protest Iran has ever witnessed. Vida Movahed, a thirty-one-year-old mother of a toddler, stood atop a large utility box on Tehran\u2019s busy Enghelab Street and removed the hijab head covering that all women are required to wear by law. Her jet-black hair cascaded far down her back. She then tied her white scarf to a stick and, as shoppers scurried beneath her on a busy thoroughfare, silently waved it like a flag. She stood there waving, alone, for an hour.\nThus began the so-called Girls of Revolution Street protest, on December 27th, and with it Iran\u2019s most robust debate about both women\u2019s rights and religious restrictions in the four decades since the fall of the Shah. Photos and videos of Movahed\u2019s defiance soon went viral. Other young women, individually and in small groups, began to follow suit, posting their pictures on social media and generating new hashtags in Farsi (#\u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646_\u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646_\u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628, which translates to #girls-enghelab-street) and in English. Movahed apparently chose the venue deliberately. \u201cEnghelab\u201d means \u201crevolution\u201d in Farsi. The street was renamed after the 1979 uprising against the monarchy; after the women\u2019s protests, it took on a new meaning. The new demonstrations of dissent spread to the historic city of Isfahan, the Caspian resort town of Rasht, and beyond.\nBy law, all females above the age of puberty must wear a head covering. The rule applies to foreigners, including female heads of state who visit Tehran. On one of my early trips to the Islamic Republic, shortly after the Revolution, I was in the lobby of the former Hilton hotel talking with an Iranian professor when a woman in a billowing black chador swept by us. She gave me the eye and then walked over to speak to a waiter serving afternoon tea and cakes. He draped a white cloth over his left arm, put a little pink card on top of a doily, on a plate, and headed in my direction.\n\u201cThe Islamic Society kindly seeks your considerate observance of its customs in promotion of mutual respect,\u201d the pink card read, in English. \u201cTo further our good relations, we respectfully request your observance of Islamic dress during your stay with us.\u201d It turned out my head scarf had slipped, revealing several inches of my hair.\nThe civil language belies a strict legal code. Since the protests began, twenty-nine women have been arrested for taking off their head scarves, according to the government. Movahed was reportedly held for a month and then released on bail last week. The disappearance of Iran\u2019s new human-rights heroine triggered its own where-is-she hashtag.\nNarges Hosseini, who was arrested on January 29th, after a similar protest on Enghelab Street, now faces charges of \u201ccommitting a sinful act\u201d and \u201cviolating public prudency,\u201d and also of \u201cencouraging immorality or prostitution.\u201d The charges carry penalties of as much as a decade in prison.

After holding private LGBT awareness events each year in June, the Kiev LGBT community decided it was time to stage the country\u2019s first Pride parade in 2012.\nHowever, because of threats, plans for the public march were aborted and, in the months following the 2012 Pride events he\u2019d helped coordinate, Karasiichuk told the Daily Beast he was attacked three times\u2014in June directly after Pride, in December while leaving a gay night club, and in February on the street while on his way home from work.\nFrom this series of attacks, Karasiichuk says he sustained a concussion and a broken jaw.

The page renderer shows things in a weird way (an artifact of it rearanging text to fit in one zoomed viewing window, removing the need to scroll around) sometimes.\nThe tabbing system seems really, really great. I prefer it over Safari\u2019s, even. Unlike Safari, you can view all your open tabs without blocking the entire page. New tabs open instantly to your home page (which is a 3\u00d73 grid of your favorite sites), and you can punch in your destination URL from there. I\u2019m sitting here jumping back and forth between 3 different tabbed windows, and there\u2019s next to zero delay. It\u2019s absolutely fantastic, and how I wish tabbing was done in Safari.\nOpera Mini compresses everything on the server side before sending it to your device, which is why it (theoretically) speeds things up and allows you to use less data. Alas, this means that if Opera\u2019s servers go down, so does Opera Mini. I\u2019ve seen the servers go down once already for about a minute during my testing, but this was presumably due to some last minute change that required a restart. When it goes down, all pages return a \u201cInternal Server Error\u201d.\nThere are definitely bugs. It\u2019s not terribly broken by any means, but bug spottings are common.\nThe multitouch pinch to zoom here is \u2026weird. It\u2019s not like Safari\u2019s, where you\u2019re really controlling the zoom level; you\u2019re really just switching between zoomed and not zoomed.\nOur first speed tests are in.\nOn a 3G connection, Opera Mini is consistently and considerably faster than Safari. We only saw one site (Facebook) where Opera Mini wasn\u2019t the clear victor, and the load times there were within about a second of each other. Both browsers had clear caches and histories, and all pages loaded were their standard PC versions (rather than their mobile-optimized counterparts).\nWiFi results were strikingly similar to the 3G results, with all pages loading faster on Opera Mini than on Safari outside of Facebook, where Safari wins by a hair. The difference in page load times were considerably less vast on WiFi."}

According to data from CB Insights, the women's health space, which can include everything from fertility tests to period tracking and menopause, is on track to have a record breaking quarter in Q1.\nCompanies that have raised funding include The Pill Club, a provider of mail-order birth control, which raised $51 million; egg freezing service Extend Fertility raised $15 million; and Ritual, a women\u2019s vitamin subscription company, raised $25 million.\nAdding to the first quarter's total is Babyscripts, a virtual care platform focused on prenatal care; earlier this week, the company announced that it raised a $500,000 round from Inova Health System, bringing its total funding to $14 million. In addition to the investment, the two companies also announced a partnership that will allow Inova to deploy the Babyscripts platform to its employee health plan through Innovation Health, with a plan to eventually offer the service to its entire system.\nBabyscripts works with healthcare providers, allowing them to get real-time data on their patients, which is collected from connected devices.

Babyscripts primarily works with providers \u2013 large health systems and private practices \u2013 and now payers to increase access to and improve the quality of prenatal care. Our founding premise was to make prenatal care available at any time, at any place through the use of both smartphone apps and remote monitoring experiences.\nBabyscripts\u2019 remote monitoring experiences increase access to crucial prenatal care by making prenatal care available at any place, at any time through the use of connected medical devices (blood pressure cuffs, weight scales, etc). Babyscripts has shown in controlled studies that it can collect weekly blood pressure and weight data points from more than 85 percent of patients every week through its service. This validated compliance to the program is singular to Babyscripts in the maternity space and allows physicians and care managers to gather necessary and validated data from patients in between prenatal visits from the comfort of the patient\u2019s home in order to detect risk earlier.\nVN: Who is the typical customer for Babyscripts?

The stately trees that towered over the city for decades were going to be removed, changing the view that attracted him to the community in the first place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Huntington Woods for a reason,\u201d Egan said.\nBothered by what looked like healthy trees getting marked, Egan took his concern to social media and then to the Huntington Woods Department of Public Works, where he was assured the city only removes trees that are damaged, diseased or at risk of falling.\n\u201cNobody will cut down a healthy tree,\u201d said Rocco Fortura, director of Public Works for Huntington Woods, which hires an arborist from Mike\u2019s Tree Surgeons to check on the health of trees. \u201cIf anything, we\u2019ll go out of our way to save a tree.\nBut reassurances like that haven't always been enough to quell the public outcry over tree removals this year in cities across southeast Oakland County, where anger has flared on social media and residents point conspiracy fingers to keep their trees from coming down.\nIn Berkley, where old silver maples are reaching the end of their lifespan and starting to rot, creating a public safety concern, residents have been complaining on Facebook and to city officials that more trees seem to be coming down this year than in the past.\nSince January, 60 trees in total were removed, with 120 scheduled to be planted in the fall.\n\u201cThere has been a lot of catching up this year,\u201d said Berkley DPW Director Derrick Schueller, adding he has heard from several residents and understands the concerns.\nPreviously, he said, the city's forestry contractor only responded when situations arose, versus providing a comprehensive tree pruning program that maximizes the canopy while making it safer for the community, Schueller said.\nTo catch up, Berkley inked a three-year contract in 2016 with J.H. Hart Urban Forestry of Sterling Heights and established a methodical tree pruning program. The company\u2019s on-staff arborists examine the public trees to determine if any are unhealthy or compromised.\nBerkley pays J.H. Hart by the crew hour, Schueller said.

Hart has similar tree removal and trimming contracts with Royal Oak and Birmingham, according to owner Judd Hart.\nTo replenish the foliage, Berkley has a tree-planting program that is putting in more than 100 trees this year, Schueller said.

A pall of smoke from the blaze was visible throughout much of the surrounding metropolitan area.\nAbout 600 to 700 visitors and staff were in the building at the time of the evacuation, observatory museum guide Juan Gutierrez told Reuters by telephone.\nGutierrez said he saw flames burning \u201cpretty close\u201d to outdoor restrooms located near the parking lot outside the main observatory entrance and along a road leading up to the site.\nIt was the third time the observatory was evacuated in the past two months because of a fire, Gutierrez said, adding that he overheard one park ranger say to another that the latest blaze appeared to have been ignited by a careless smoker.\nHumphrey said the cause of the fire was under investigation.\nThe observatory, dedicated to astronomy for public viewing and education rather than research, was opened in 1935 and draws about 1.5 million visitors a year to Griffith Park, one of the largest municipal parks in the United States.\nProviding a real-life backdrop for various Hollywood movies ranging from \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d to \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Griffith Park was the scene of a 1933 wildfire that killed 29 people, ranking as the single deadliest blaze on record in California.\nThe 4,300-acre park and observatory are both named for Griffith J.

He noted that such efforts have resulted in little progress. The \u201cprogress\u201d Prince was referring to was defeating \u201cterrorism\u201d and preventing the country from becoming a safe haven for organizations like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\nThere\u2019s really three ways we can go in Afghanistan. We can pull out completely, in which case, the Afghan government would likely collapse in a matter of weeks and the terrorists would run the country. And for as hard as, you know, we may be pushing in Iraq or Syria and elsewhere to destroy the Islamic State, this would give them a victory.\nUnfortunately for Prince and others attempting to propose the privatization of the Afghan war, Afghanistan already is a safe haven for terrorists. Al Qaeda had only a nascent presence there before the US invasion in 2001. The Islamic State, in its current form, did not even exist.\nBoth organizations flourish not because of a lack of US troops in Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq, but precisely because US foreign policy has turned its attention toward each nation and has intentionally used both terrorist organizations as proxies.\nIn Afghanistan, while Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are used as a pretext for both the continued presence of US troops there and now the proposed deployment of a private army headed by an \u201cAmerican viceroy,\u201d the real battle has always been against the Taliban and in favor of an obedient client state headquartered in Kabul.\nIn pursuit of defeating the Taliban and the creation of a sustainable client state, the extensive use of private contractors in Afghanistan has not been part of any sort of coherent solution. Instead, private contractors are one of the most central reasons attempts at rebuilding Afghanistan have failed.\nPrivate contractors seek to maximize profits and return home, and ultimately do not care what happens in Afghanistan. In many ways, shoddy work and continued chaos ensures continued contracts and immense profits. The estimated 2.4 trillion dollars spent on Afghanistan so far have not simply \u201cdisappeared.\u201d This immense amount of wealth has been transferred from US taxpayers to, in part, private contractors and the defense industry.\nThe notion of creating an \u201cAmerican viceroy\u201d leading a private army in Afghanistan would give people like Erik Prince and other ambitious heads of contracting firms an entire nation to preside over and a government-subsidized budget to do it with. With the nation\u2019s immense narcotics industry and that industry\u2019s apparent ability to export worldwide under the nose of the US military with impunity, contractors notorious for systemic impropriety would have additional sources of revenue to tap and develop.\nR"}

The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades.\nOn a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.\nThirty-five years later, the stadium stands ready to receive a speedy, $18.5 million makeover to get it ready for the April 14 home opener of the Washington Nationals. First, though, the D.C. Council must approve the renovation money - the final vote is today - as part of a half-billion-dollar package that includes funding for a new stadium on the Anacostia River.\nLike a stand-in for a Broadway show, RFK Stadium will serve as the temporary home of the Nationals for three years while the new stadium is built.\nFunding for both projects was preliminarily approved by the council on Nov. 30 on a 6-4 vote. Chairman Linda Cropp and two other members abstained, hoping to send a message that Major League Baseball needed to negotiate a better deal for the District.\nAs the final vote approached, Cropp indicated that she would likely back the measure, meaning it will probably be approved.\nAccording to officials familiar with the negotiations, baseball has agreed to modify the stadium deal to address specific council concerns.\nThose concerns included a 12-day annual limit on when the city can use the new stadium, a provision requiring the city to pay damages if the stadium is not built on time and worries that the deal's language wasn't strong enough regarding baseball's community responsibilities.\nBaseball agreed to compromise on all three issues - and more. \"We've tried to be as flexible as we can,\" said John McHale, a Major League Baseball vice president, who declined to provide details.\nBaseball recently sent a list of the concessions to the city. Some issues - like the exact number of days the city can use the stadium - must still be worked out.\nCropp had requested just that sort of flexibility.\nSaid Cropp spokesman Mark Johnson: \"My impression is she's pretty much on the road to getting something she can support.\"\nA number of council amendments are expected to be voted on today, including one that would create a new cap so that stadium costs aren't out of control.\nApproval of the funding will mean, among other things, that contractors can get started on giving RFK its second life.\n\"Everything is all teed up to go,\" said Scott Burrell, director of special projects for the D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission.\nBuilt in 1961 as D.C. Stadium, the building with the distinctive curving roof was home to the Redskins, who left for FedEx Field in 1997, and to baseball's Senators until they departed for Texas 33 years ago.\nMany baseball-starved Washingtonians thought they might never see another game in the stadium where Ted Williams once managed and Senators outfielder Frank Howard hit home runs that are still memorialized by painted white seats in the upper deck where the monster shots landed.\nStadium caretakers have preserved plaques with the names of Howard, John Riggins and other Senators and Redskins greats that ring"}

Data collected by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found the risks of crashes increased as much as 2,300 percent for texting drivers, far worse than previously believed. And for those who just use the phone to talk in traffic, a survey by the feds - concealed from public view for years before being released last week - shows the risk of a crash is about the same even with a hands-free setup.\nOf course, we didn't need a $6 million, 18-month study to tell us what common sense already made obvious: When you're typing out a text message, or reading one that's come in, your eyes aren't on the road and your hands aren't on the wheel. When you're making a call, dialing the number requires looking at the phone, not at the road. When you're talking on the phone, your attention is split between the conversation you're having and the guy you just cut off with inches to spare while changing lanes.\nIn study after study, people acknowledge that such highway multitasking distracts them and is dangerous. When you pick up that cell phone while your car is in motion, you aren't just taking the phone in your hands, you're taking your life, the lives of your passengers and every other driver nearby on the road into those same hands.\nUnfortunately, good judgment and, in the case of teenagers, parental influence, only go so far. Indeed, most of those who agree distracted driving is perilous admit doing some form of it anyway, and many have a near-miss experience they can share. Text messaging jumped elevenfold from 2005 to 2008. That's why laws - and the fines that come with them - are also needed to dissuade people from putting themselves and others at risk.\nAnd lawmakers have responded, though as is often the case, too many of their measures are merely feel-good and ineffective or too far-reaching. For example, it makes little sense to lay down rules at the municipal level, as Chicago unilaterally did. Who pauses at a city border to find out whether they can text while driving? Likewise, the bill rolled out this week by several Democratic U.S. senators to pull millions of federal highway dollars from states without texting bans only bullies states into a decision.\nFar better, and more in keeping with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, that states reach these conclusions on their own, as 14 of them have. Illinois could be No. 15 if Gov. Pat Quinn would sign House Bill 71.

Yet, investors hit the sell button.\n\"Sales were slightly weaker than expected,\" Cramer admitted. \"And, the company's domestic growth decelerated by 700 basis points versus the previous quarter,\" Cramer added.\nBut should those metrics warrant a 6% decline?\n\"I think a big part of the reason why Hain's down so much is because this is a high-quality growth stock that people have come to expect quite a lot from, and we're in an environment where if you don't execute perfectly, your stock goes lower, period,\" he said.\nNew CEO to make Microsoft more relevant?\nAlthough emerging markets woes and concerns about the next jobs numbers are the big catalysts in the market right now, ultimately Cramer believes these and other headwinds will die down.\nAnd when they do, Cramer believes investors will take a second look at companies that reported solid, if not perfect earnings, such as Hain.\nAnd its earnings were very solid.\nFor example, net sales grew 17% to $534.9 million and Hain boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook.\nTherefore, Cramer can't help but wonder, \"Is the pullback in Hain simply a rare chance to buy a high-quality stock at a discount, in a name that hardly ever gives you this kind of pullback?\"\n\"You know that I'm a huge believer in the healthy eating theme,\" Cramer reminded.

Down the road thousands of activists from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Fatah movement storm Gaza\u2019s parliamentary building, venting their rage at an institution and a leadership they hold responsible for an abject defeat. The violent implosion of Fatah is one consequence of Hamas\u2019s triumph in the Palestinian Authority (PA) parliamentary elections on January 25. There are many others.\nOne week before the poll a Hamas leader told me \u201cfifty-five seats for us would be an achievement.\u201d Hamas won seventy-six seats (seventy-eight if Hamas-backed independents are included) against Fatah\u2019s forty-three in the 132-member chamber, a rout compounded by the fact that seventy-four independent Fatah members stood against their movement\u2019s official list. Hamas was united behind one list.\nThree factors contributed to Hamas\u2019s victory: Palestinian disillusionment that peace or a return to meaningful negotiations with Israel were anywhere on the horizon; appreciation for Hamas\u2019s record of clean and selfless service providing as well as its role in the armed resistance, widely seen as the cause of Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza this past summer; and, above all, profound antipathy generated by a decade of Fatah\u2019s misrule of the PA, capped by the PA\u2019s failure to bring political progress, economic recovery, law or order in the aftermath of the Gaza withdrawal.\nWhat does Hamas do with \u201can election win that is bigger than its capabilities?\u201d asks Gaza-based Palestinian analyst Nasser Aliwar.

And solar firms are ramping up investments in these regions, signaling their faith that key renewable energy incentives will remain in place for years to come.\nThe industry\u2019s sunny outlook illustrates the complexity of green power politics in Washington and casts doubt on whether the administration can boost the coal and nuclear sectors while subsidies continue to the fuel growth of competing wind and solar.\nSolar expansion in the middle of the country is offsetting its slowing growth in the maturing California and Northeast markets. That marks a big shift for an industry that has historically relied on politically liberal coastal states where renewable energy development is mandated to combat air pollution and climate change.\nWith falling development costs, solar firms now see strong prospects in conservative states with no such mandates.\nThe estimated costs of solar power generation have dropped 85 percent since 2009, making its unsubsidized cost competitive with natural gas in the sunniest locations, according to a report by Lazard, an asset management firm.\nStill, the sector\u2019s growth continues to rely on public support. The U.S. Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation earlier this year estimated that solar projects would receive $12.3 billion in tax breaks between 2016 and 2020.\nTrump has never specifically proposed repealing those incentives but has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both \"very, very expensive\".\nThe president\u2019s Energy Secretary Rick Perry last month called for new rules to subsidize coal and nuclear energy, arguing that the rise of weather-dependent solar and wind power would make the grid less reliable.\nThis week, Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, said during in a speech in Kentucky that he would scrap incentives for renewable energy firms and let them \u201cstand on their own,\u201d while acknowledging the decision rests with Congress.\nA White House official did not respond to a request for comment and clarification of the administration\u2019s position on solar subsidies. But other Republicans are outspoken in their continuing support for the incentives, using an economic rather than environmental rationale.\nOf the 10 states that installed the largest amounts of solar power over the past year, six were Republican-led, according to the GTM Research data. Of those, Utah, North Carolina and Texas each installed more than 1 gigawatt of solar, or enough to power about 700,000 homes.\nIndustry players hope solar growth in states that form Trump\u2019s political base will influence how he decides later this yar in a trade case they fear could lead to tariffs on solar panels imported to the U.S.\nSolar and wind energy firms have become important constituents in some Republican-led states because they employ about 300,000 people nationwide - six times the number working in the coal industry, according to industry and government data.\nIn 201"}

We say it to our children and hope that they will remember it for the rest of their lives. We all know that to earn respect, we must first give respect and, of course, give it to ourselves as well, for if you don\u2019t respect yourself, then no one else will respect you.\nRespect is one of the foundation stones of a healthy relationship but sadly it is very often not recognised as being essential.\nSome of my readers may well remember that I regularly write about how to motivate and increase performance without money. There are many ways that we can do this and giving respect is just one of those ways that costs nothing but can be worth much. According to the words of the old Beatles song \u2018Money can\u2019t buy you love\u2019 but one might wonder if it can buy you respect? If we had sufficient money, would people automatically respect you? Would it buy influence?\nI was interested to read four studies undertaken by the University of California, Berkeley in a paper published in the Psychological Science journal which showed that the admiration and respect of our peers have a greater bearing on our overall happiness in life than our bank balance or the status of being rich. These studies showed that there was clear evidence that sociometric status was linked to well-being whereas socio-economic status was not.\nSo, if we can help someone feel valued and worthwhile and treat them with respect, then why don\u2019t we? We all know the good feeling that we experience when we feel respected. The chances are that we feel better inside, we have more energy, we have more to give and ultimately, we will be more resilient to manage the everyday challenges that life throws at us everyday.\nAnd yet, I go into companies on a regular basis and see managers and colleagues talking in a way that is not conducive to getting the most out of their teams. It\u2019s possible that they missed out on that particular communications lesson when they were a child. Or maybe, they weren\u2019t treated with respect and later on in adult life, it became a habit not to give respect to others.\nIt is generally accepted that possibly the most important factor in any relationship, in a marriage or partnership, is respect. It\u2019s the essential ingredient that makes any human interaction work.\n\u2022 Listening attentively and acknowledging someone\u2019s views will enable the person to feel valued and respected. Try to look directly at the person to whom you are talking or to whom you are listening. Eye contact is an important reassurance to the other party that you have an interest in what they are saying. It gives them confidence, which is one result of the giving of respect. When talking to a child, introduce the word \u2018respect\u2019 into their vocabulary so that they know what it means to them and what it can mean to someone else.\n\u2022 The words dignity and respect go hand in hand. We all have different customs and ways of working and living. And we should respect and value those differences.\n\u2022 Respect comes when you empathise with the other person in a way that will encourage them to feel respected and so return the favour.\n\u2022 To put other people\u2019s need before yours will convey your feeling of respect to them.\n\u2022 A simple act of kindness can demonstrate respect.\n\u2022 Avoid stereotyping people because that often reduces respect.\n\u2022 Accepting all people for being different will show respect for their customs and religion.\n\u2022 Understanding another person\u2019s likes and dislikes will demonstrate respect.\n\u2022 Never humiliate anyone because of social status.\n\u2022 Apologising for a mistake can convey a sincere regret if you have hurt someone unintentionally.\nRespect is about"}

{"idx": "8310", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: My conversations with individuals and institutions over the course of last week highlighted what a few in government and many more outside already know and fear. Since January 8, 2015, politics as usual has trumped the promise of a new political culture, captured best by the yahapalanaya brand. This was expected, though to see and live through it is no less depressing. A friend succinctly flagged salient features of the challenge at a meeting held to trace the contours of what today is a promising, new, government led communications initiative. Those in power now trust more those they perceived to be loyal (either to self or party) more than those with skills and experience. Critical commentary, including that which holds the President, PM and the rest of government accountable to the promises they themselves made, is seen as unnecessary, inconvenient and as a sign of trouble. So instead of attending to or focusing on the short-comings flagged, attention is almost entirely devoted to deny, decry or destroy the messenger. Adding to this is a new and already complex constellation of party political appointees and personal favourites, acting as gatekeepers and firewalls to ideas, information and input that can from those without any interest in SUVs, the perks of office or foreign jaunts, strengthen governance.\nThe result is government in a cocoon and a debilitating metamorphosis of governance from promise to reality. Those in government are surrounded by outmoded, outdated thinking by those who favour self-advancement through genuflection. Rather than call their bluff, for vanity, partisan parochialism, fear or some misguided strategic interest, those in power continuously countenance the bad advice they receive from those they have appointed to positions of significant authority. The more powerful the office, the more isolating it is. This is why even with the best of intent, efforts around course-correction through for example better, more strategic media and communications planning, will fail unless there is traction from the highest political offices in the country. This works to the Joint Opposition\u2019s benefit, and those in government who are deeply conventional and conservative in their political outlook, resisting to the extent they can the absolutely vital upgrade to and reboot of our constitutional operating system.\nWhat this means is that everything officially on the table \u2013 from transitional justice to constitutional reform and fragile negotiations over policymaking conducted sub rosa, is at risk. And yet, the art of the long view requires us to appreciate that individuals and institutions in power are, to varying degrees, hostage to the systemic nature of power. Political reform, beyond manifestos and in almost every single instance when in power, is deeply often combatively resisted. And yet, despite what appears to be a growing disenchantment with the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration across the media landscape, I remain cautiously optimistic for several reasons.\nThe criticism against government, though increasing in volume, vectors and velocity, is still fuelled and framed by a fidelity towards yahapalanaya more than strident opposition towards President or PM. In other words, the criticism is not a call, yet, for changing government. And given that it is the JO and the Rajapaksas who want to reclaim power, any direct, open effort to regain authority will result in an immediate, sustained and entirely organic opposition that spans the digital to physical resistance. This is important, because this support for government isn\u2019t engineered or controlled by government.

In this instance, I am referring to the recent decision by the Trump administration to rescind the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program \u2014 a move that leaves nearly 800,000 young people in a sort of legal limbo. That the administration gave congress 6 months to come up with a long-term solution is potentially positive, but with the bitterness, acrimony and lack of willingness to compromise by most everyone in Washington, I'm not holding my breath that anything will be accomplished. The cynic in me says that the Administration did this in an attempt to broker a deal for the wall \u2014 i.e.\n, the \"Dreamers\" as they are called, may stay, in exchange for congressional approval of funds to build the wall \u2014 a multi-billion dollar boondoggle in my opinion.\nIt is unfortunate that our immigration debate has become so political. I think that most of us would agree that there is a need for some type of comprehensive immigration policy. For example, I know of no one that is in favor of allowing bomb-toting anarchists or drug cartels to immigrate to the United States. And once we all agree upon that, then the debate is really over \"where\" we draw the line, not whether or not one needs to be drawn.\nIn the current situation, DACA was implemented by Presidential order (which arguably wasn't the best way to create this safety net, but considering the lack of compromise that existed at the time, it may have been the only way for this to be achieved). The basic tenant of DACA is that if you were a child whose parents came to this country, you weren't going to be deported. To be eligible, each person seeking DACA status had to apply. They were screened predicated upon several factors, which included attending school or serving in the military, along with passing a criminal background check. The DACA kids aren't street thugs and hooligans. They are responsible young people seeking access to the American Dream and a better way of life for themselves.\nInterestingly the Trump Administration has already approved over 200,000 DACA applications so it appears that the administration wasn't really questioning the legality of the order, but rather was fulfilling a campaign promise and posturing for a more comprehensive immigration policy, which while most of us would probably agree is long overdue, will be nearly impossible (nearly?) to achieve in 6 months.\nThink for a moment about the youngsters that are now exposed to potential deportation. Many of them don't even speak Spanish. They are \"cultural Americans\" having grown up in this country. Many of them have siblings born subsequent to their parents' arrival in this country that are American citizens. Are we really going to create a situation where we are separating children from their families? And for what?? We are not talking about deporting a criminal element.

{"idx": "8316", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Review Fedora 26, released recently, is a welcome update on the already very nice 25.\nAs with Fedora's last couple of releases, there are three major ways to get Fedora 26 \u2013 Workstation, Server and Atomic Host. The Workstation release is aimed at desktop users and, by default, will install the GNOME desktop. Server and Atomic Host target, yes, servers and container-based deployments respectively.\nFedora 26 brings an updated kernel, version 4.11, Mesa 17.1.4, and jumps to GCC 7. More visible changes include the latest version of GNOME, 3.24, a new partitioning tool in the Anaconda installer, and much better support for ARM processors, notably an official version of Fedora for Raspberry Pi, which appears to be much more stable than the previous release that appeared to have more caveats than features.\nThe most obvious change is the move to GNOME 3.24. Nicknamed Portland, this version ships with quite a few new features and improved applications, including Night Light. Night Light is a new settings panel that tints the colour of your displays according to the time of day, although you can also manually control it if you like. In the evening Night Light makes the screen color warmer, which helps prevent sleeplessness and eye strain. The GNOME top bar shows when Night Light is on, and the system drop-down menu allows you to turn it off temporarily. That's handy if you want to edit photos or similar because what you see is not what you get with Night Light.\nThere are quite a few third-party apps that already provided the features of Night Light, but none of them worked seamlessly with Wayland, which makes Night Light a welcome addition to the GNOME feature stack \u2013 it works with X11 too if you aren't on Wayland-capable hardware.\nGNOME 3.24 features an improved notification system, with a simplified layout and weather info integration \u2013 it will pull in a summary of the day's forecast for the location that you set in the weather application.\nGNOME applications updated in 3.24 include Web, Photos, Polari (yes, GNOME still ships with an IRC client, because one day we'll all realise that IRC was amazing and go back to using it), Games, Calendar and the Calculator.\nOf these, the most notable is Photos, which now adjusts your thumbnail size to make better use of the available space. Unfortunately, Photos still has only very basic editing tools, but it does make a good organiser.\nGNOME Software continues to see improvements in this release with new icons that make it easier to see which applications are installed. The installed applications view also now helpfully shows how much disk space each application is taking up.\nThe Software app has also improved Flatpak support with a couple of minor new features though the number of apps available as Flatpaks remains disappointingly small.\nAs you scroll through that list of installed apps checking the sizes, you'll probably notice one monster taking up more space than most \u2013 LibreOffice. Normally version bumps of LibreOffice are hardly worth mentioning, but this one contains the first look many users will get at the still-in-progress NotebookBar UI, which apes Microsoft Word's Ribbon interface.\nI happen to dislike Ribbon and by extension NotebookBar, but it will probably go a long way to making it easier for Office users to switch to LibreOffice.

The crowd of over-enthusiastic party workers was concerned about the leader's health since he visited the city for the time after he was attacked by Harvindar Singh on November 24 in Delhi.\nThe whole episode took place in the evening when Pawar came to the campus of the Modi Baug building to meet the party supporters.

{"idx": "8320", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The second version of Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet offers some good enhancements, primarily to the kickstand and the available accessories. We think it's a great tablet all up, especially if you like the idea of carrying around a fully functional computer in a tablet form factor. There are still some issues regarding its usability and finish.\nTake the best parts of a tablet and a laptop, join them together, and you\u2019ll probably end up with something similar to the 10.6in Microsoft Surface Pro 2. It has all the features most of us Windows users want under the hood and in the hardware\u2019s design, and Microsoft has even tweaked the original design to make the sequel device a little better overall. However, it still has issues.\nThe main thing to note about the Surface Pro 2 is that it\u2019s a full-blown computer that runs a full version of Windows 8.1 on a screen that has a Full HD resolution. You can use this tablet to run practically any software that you are used to running on your Windows-based desktop or laptop computer \u2014 except for many taxing games, though it did record a decent score of 4473 in the 3DMark Cloud Gate test. The model that we tested runs a fourth generation Intel Core i5-4200U CPU, which has two cores, Hyper-Threading, a standard frequency of 1.6GHz, and built-in Intel HD graphics. It\u2019s a CPU that gives the Surface Pro 2 a little more efficiency when it comes to power handling, without sacrificing performance. We also got 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM and a 64GB solid state drive (SSD).\nWhat we tested is a base configuration, though, which has a price of $1019. There is also a 128GB version that comes with 4GB of RAM, and there are 256GB and 512GB versions that come with 8GB of RAM. The most you can expect to pay is $2039 (sans options), according to Microsoft\u2019s Web site, and that\u2019s for the 512GB version, which wasn\u2019t in stock at the time of writing. It\u2019s nice to have so much variety regarding storage capacity and RAM for a tablet device, though the CPU and the rest of the configuration stays the same, mainly because the enclosure is designed for a specific thermal output and changing the other components would also require a different enclosure.\nThese specs basically put the Surface Pro 2 on par with a modern Ultrabook computer, and our performance tests bore this out. Our Blender 3D rendering test took just 50sec; our iTunes MP3 encoding test took 58sec; our Handbrake DVD-to-MP4 conversion test took 21min 50sec. The SSD recorded read and write rates of 477.9 megabytes per second (MBps) and 174.3MBps, respectively, in CrystalDiskMark. Compared to one of the thinnest and lightest touchscreen Ultrabooks on the market, Sony\u2019s VAIO Pro 13, which uses the same CPU, the Surface Pro 2 recorded the exact same time in Blender, was two seconds slower in iTunes, faster by about 7min in Handbrake, but slower in the CrystalDiskMark tests. The slower storage performance against the Sony is due to the Sony having a PCI Express based SSD, which offers greater throughput.\nFor whatever you use an Ultrabook, you can also use the Surface Pro 2.

Then, even more people wrote about the big promise that big data holds for the business. And now, a lot more is being written about the big failures of big data. However, the topic that is least discussed \u2013 and what I believe should be top of mind \u2013 is the big secret to delivering big value from big data.\nAs they say \u2013 it\u2019s about the journey and not the end. This is exactly right! Let\u2019s look at the typical big data journey. Meet Joe, a big data enthusiast, the hero of my story. Everyone was talking about Hadoop. Joe wanted to see for himself what all the noise was about. Commodity hardware \u2013 check! Credit card \u2013 check! Hadoop downloaded \u2013 check! Self-help tutorials \u2013 check! Ready to go \u2013 check!\nJoe was excited \u2013 he had taken that first step into the big world of big data. He had quickly built himself a cool new sandbox to play in. He landed new types of data into it, and the system simply sucked it in without any extra work using schema on read \u2013 cool stuff! He then cranked things up and lo and behold, tons and tons of data swept in, without even breaking a sweat. It was alive!\nKnees shaking, Joe ran to get Samantha, his data scientist friend, to show her his handiwork. Samantha took one look at the sandbox and told Joe that this was just the beginning of a game changer for the business. The company had been looking for ways to improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns \u2013 maybe they would be the ones that would show the way.\nSamantha told Joe about something she had heard about \u2013 a data lake. Maybe he could help her build it. They could simply land all their marketing data into this data lake, quickly prep it, write some code, and before they knew it, uncover some amazing ways to target their very best customers. No more complicated data warehousing stuff. It was the brave new world!\nThey imagined the moment when they would present Fred, their CMO, with some amazing new ways to deliver the next best offers to their customers. They imagined his grin when he saw the marketing pipeline going through the roof. They imagined walking up the ramp to receive their Employee of the Year awards. They imagined a promotion and a vacation in Bora Bora. The possibilities were endless!\nBut here\u2019s where Joe\u2019s story falls flat on its face. Six months after starting to build a data lake, Joe and Samantha were exactly where they started \u2013 with no meaningful results. The data they needed was not just in Hadoop. It could not be instantly trusted. There was a new technology to master every day. And, it was painful, manual, hard labor. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\nUnfortunately it was. According to Gartner1, \u201cthrough 2018, 70 percent of Hadoop deployments will fail to meet cost-savings and revenue-generation objectives due to skills and integration challenges.\u201d And, \u201cthrough 2018, 80 percent of data lakes will not include effective metadata management capabilities, making them inefficient.\u201dThe big secret to delivering big value with big data lies in those very words.\nBig data is no different from small data. Yes, there is a larger variety of data, and a greater quantity of data to be handled. But does that mean that the very fundamental principles of managing data should be ignored? Definitely not. With any data \u2013 big or small \u2013 you still have to acquire, ingest, transform, secure"}

By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend. Two funds of this type, the Alpine Global Dividend Fund (NYSE:AGD) and the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund (NYSE:AOD), have seen their net asset value decline substantially since their inception. For us as investors, that's generally not attractive, since we are getting taxable dividends at the cost of a capital loss.\nLeveraged funds: These funds achieve their high dividend by leverage and investing in shares or bonds whose yields exceed the cost of the leverage. A very popular type of this fund in recent years has been the mortgage REIT, such as American Capital Agency (Nasdaq: AGNC) and Annaly Capital (Nasdaq: NLY); both have dividends of 14.9% and 13%. The problem with these is that when interest rates rise, the price of the mortgages declines and their funding costs rise, so most of the income disappears and the funds have a capital loss. Similarly, funds achieving the same effect by leveraged investing in stocks have much more risk in a bear market. Still AGNC and NLY have between them $26 billion of market capitalization, so their marketing strategy works even if their investment model fails in the long run.\nOption-income funds: These funds buy shares and sell call options, paying out the call-option premiums they receive as income. By definition, the net asset value of these funds normally underperforms the market indices, since shares are called away from them in bull markets. However, on an overall basis, skillful management can enable the funds to provide a total return, including dividends and capital returns, which is at least competitive. The Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (NYSE: ETB), currently makes a quarterly payout of 32.4 cents/share, giving it a yield of just under 10%. What's more, it's currently trading at about 11% below net asset value. For me, it's always attractive to buy $100 of assets for $89.\nInternational unleveraged funds: Finally, there are a few international closed-end funds, normally invested in single-country markets. They provide support to their share prices simply by paying out a percentage of net asset value each quarter, even though only part of the payout is covered by dividends. Provided the market in which the funds invest is growing satisfactorily and is not overpriced (so dividends are a substantial part of the payout) these funds can maintain their net asset values as well as making good payouts. For example, the Aberdeen Chile Fund (NYSE: CH) is the one I mentioned earlier as being part of my Permanent Wealth Investor portfolio. It invests in one of the world's premier growth markets and currently makes quarterly payouts at a rate of 10% of net asset value per annum.\nIn an earlier article Martin explained how emerging market dividend stocks"}

Mr. McCarthy has summoned his fiercest visions to invoke the devastation.

And in a perverse miracle it yields one last calamity when it seems that things cannot possibly get worse.\nThe father\u2019s loving efforts to shepherd his son are made that much more wrenching by the unavailability of food, shelter, safety, companionship or hope in most places where they scavenge to subsist.\nThe ruined setting of \u201cThe Road\u201d is strewn with terrible, revealing artifacts. There are old newspapers. (\u201cThe curious news. The quaint concerns.\u201d) There is one lone bottle of Coca-Cola, still absurdly fizzy when all else is dust. There are charred corpses frozen in their final postures, like the long-dead man who sits on a porch like \u201ca straw man set out to announce some holiday.\u201d Sometimes these prompt the father to recall \u201ca dull rose glow in the windowglass\u201d at 1:17 in the morning, the moment when the clocks stopped forever.\n\u201cThe Road\u201d is not concerned with explaining what caused this cataclysm. It is more abstract than that. Instead it becomes a relentless cautionary tale with \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d-style symbolic impact, marked by a dark fascination with the primal laws of survival.

Here\u2019s what the numbers say.\nThis lofty rhetoric certainly seems farcical as 2018 draws to a close with government (controlled by the president\u2019s party) shut down, markets in free-fall, and allies abroad fearing an increasingly unpredictable president.\nWith such a schism in reality \u2014 between the president and his supporters who think things are going fine and critics alarmed by each new tweet and headline \u2014 numbers are often helpful to get some objective truth.\nHere is the truth of how the Trump administration is doing, looking at the numbers.\nDespite Trump\u2019s singular focus on trade, America is importing more goods, while exporting less, than it ever has. The federal government announced earlier this month that America\u2019s trade deficit hit $55.5 billion in October, rising almost a billion dollars from September. This is a ten-year high. Rising imports for goods were the main driver \u2014 that month\u2019s trade deficit in goods hit $76.9 billion.\nThe reality is much darker.\nFor the first time in almost a decade, the rate of uninsured children in the United States increased, according to a study from Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and families. The report found that 276,000 more kids didn\u2019t have coverage in 2017 than in 2016, raising the total to 3.9 million. That\u2019s 5 percent of all people under the age of 18, compared to 4.7 percent the year before.\nThis is an unprecedented increase in how many kids don\u2019t have health insurance, after years of rising coverage rates thanks to bipartisan efforts to expand Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Trump administration has been chipping away at the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid access (through work requirements). The increase in states that did not expand Medicaid was nearly triple the rate in states that did expand.\nTrump has said multiple times that he has already begun constructing his border wall, despite constant fights with Congress to appropriate the money to his administration.\nHowever, the Department of Homeland Security admitted last week that no new wall has been constructed on the border under Trump. There has been some replacement and maintenance work done on existing areas of fencing, but zero miles of new wall have been completed in the Trump administration. This lack of new construction angers Trump\u2019s archconservative allies, and the wall\u2019s existence or nonexistence does absolutely nothing for border security. Trump\u2019s inability to realize his most famous campaign promise also reveals the absurdity of his claim of doing a better job than any other president.\nHe also signed legislation opening up 1.5 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration. This paired with some additional public lands changes implemented by the Interior Department adds up to 3.3 million acres which lost protections \u2014 the largest such action in the nation\u2019s history.\nBut in October, a Pew survey found that 70 percent of people across the globe said they lacked confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to do the right thing in world affairs, while 27 percent had confidence in him.\nThis is a change from President Obama\u2019s rating of 64 percent at the end of his presidency, with 23 percent having no confidence. Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been marked by erratic diplomatic moves and rhetoric, broken treaties, and the humanitarian crisis at the border.\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh became Justice Kavanaugh in October despite having the largest percentage of Americans opposed"}

With so many top chefs jockeying for a position, Cambridge can now lay claim to being a fine dining destination. And you thought Harvard college life was competitive.\nFresh from receiving a degree in anthropology from Brown, owner and founder of Rialto Jody Adams, like any college grad, wanted a job.

She interviewed with Boston restaurateur Lydia Shire and was hired to work in her Seasons restaurant.\n\u201cI knew how to cook, I was a good cook, but I didn\u2019t know how to cook in a restaurant. I was covered in burns and cuts and I was making mistakes and I got yelled at and I cried,\u201d says Adams, sitting in her office in the Charles Hotel, surrounded by shelves of cookbooks.\nShe quickly rose through the ranks, from line chef to sous chef to head chef to the chef owner of Rialto 20 years ago. She became the sole owner in 2007, the same year Rialto was named one of the best restaraunts in the country by Esquire. She has garnered almost every conceivable award including being named the James Beard/Perrier-Jouet Best Chef of the Northeast in 1997.\nFor Adams, Cambridge\u2019s culinary successes can be attributed to its talented, intelligent inhabitants as well as its history of forward thinking in the realm of dining.\n\u201cCambridge, I think, is where the genesis of interesting, forward-thinking cooking started: at the Harvest,\u201d she says.

{"idx": "8340", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Throughout the commissioner's investigation of George Steinbrenner's association with Howard Spira, the Yankee owner argued that baseball should also look into the connection between Spira and Dave Winfield. Spira, Steinbrenner contended, became involved on the periphery of baseball through Winfield.\nSteinbrenner, however, also had an early link with Spira through a business relationship the owner had with Al Frohman, Winfield's agent. The business relationship was formed Feb. 2, 1981, according to a copy of the agreement that was obtained yesterday by The New York Times.\nFrohman, who represented Winfield when the outfielder signed with the Yankees as a free agent on Dec. 15, 1980, formed a company called Top Hat to secure endorsements, commercials and other income-producing ventures for Winfield, Steinbrenner and Frohman. Top Hat then entered into an agreement with Steinbrenner, in which Top Hat and the Yankees would share in the income. The agreement was signed by Steinbrenner and Frohman. Spira a Vice President Spira, who had become friendly with Frohman, was involved as vice president for public relations of Top Hat, although there seemed to have been little formal executive structure. Spira has recalled that he often answered the telephone at Top Hat's offices in Fort Lee, N.J., when Steinbrenner called Frohman and that the owner was aware of his presence and his function.\nSteinbrenner has remained publicly silent as developments in his problems with baseball continue to mushroom.\nLast week, former Federal Bureau of Investigation agents told of his close relationship with F.B.I. agents in Tampa, Fla., which led to possibly questionable practices and perhaps even the Federal indictment of Spira on extortion charges.\nWhile these questions and charges arose, Steinbrenner and his lawyers were raising questions about their agreement with Commissioner Fay Vincent under which Steinbrenner must yield control of the Yankees by Aug. 20. They wanted Vincent to join them in issuing a news release clarifying some of the elements of the agreement, but the commissioner flatly rejected their approach, warning them that any attempt to alter the agreement could result in further sanctions.\nMore than half a dozen lawyers, according to a source close to the Steinbrenner camp, have spent the past few days studying the possibility of filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit, charging that Vincent has violated the agreement. Their problem, the source said, is finding definite aspects of the agreement that they can show have been breached.\nThe lawyers, the source added, believed they had a much better case before Steinbrenner agreed to the commissioner's punishment, including the stipulation that he would not initiate litigation over the sanctions or anything relating to the matter. If he were to file a lawsuit now, Steinbrenner could put his remaining baseball status in serious jeopardy.\nWhile he ponders a lawsuit, Steinbrenner has to attend to the succession of his son, Hank, as general partner of the Yankees. The Yankees' partners are scheduled to meet Wednesday and vote on Steinbrenner's nomination of his son.\nThe nomination apparently faces opposition from some limited partners but not nearly enough to block a victory, which requires two-thirds of the ownership shares.\nSteinbrenner had to nominate a successor as a result of the disciplinary action the commissioner has taken against him because of his association with Spira.

Last year, the telecom industry promised to make mobile calls to 1800 numbers free of charge from January 2015.\n\u201cSix weeks past the delivery date the number of telcos that have yet to implement this change is disappointing,\u201d said ACCAN CEO Teresa Corbin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair for some consumers who are still paying for mobile calls to 1800 numbers which are used by essential services like Centrelink, financial counsellors, and drug, alcohol and mental health services. These organisations are keen to let their clients know they can call their 1800 contact numbers for free.\nThe policy of some mobile telcos to charge for 1800 calls especially hurts low-income consumers, said Fiona Guthrie, executive director of Financial Counselling Australia.\nVodafone said it offers free 1800 calling on some plans.\n\"We\u2019re confident that Vodafone offers market-leading plans that meet a broad range of customer needs that offer substantially better value that the big two,\" a Vodafone spokesperson said. \"Vodafone already offers unlimited 1800 calling on its Red plans, and 1800 calls are able to be made as part of included value for other prepaid and postpaid plans.\"\nYatango will soon make 1800 calls free, a spokesperson said.\n\"Making 1800 calls free was always on the roadmap for us, and all of our users will soon be able to make unlimited 1800 calls from their mobiles for no extra charge.\"\n\u201cACCAN has been working with industry to achieve this outcome since 2010 and we\u2019re urging all mobile telcos to follow the lead by making 1800 number calls free for all Australian mobile consumers in the near future,\u201d said Corbin.\nCorrection: ACCAN said it was mistaken that Jeenee Mobile charges for calls to 1800 numbers.

And neither did Battelle, until the admission was dragged out of him by Jon Garfunkel of Civilities.net.\n\"Yes, The NYT Company is an investor in my company Federated Media,\" confessed Battelle \"I very much doubt this had anything to do with my having a chance to write this but I agree, it should have been disclosed in the Op Ed somewhere.\"\nThe Gray Lady, as the paper loves to be called, has a ponderous \"Ethical Journalism Guidebook\", which it threw away for the occasion.\nTimes readers apply exacting standards to the entire paper. They do not distinguish between staff written articles and those written by outsiders. Thus as far as possible, freelance contributors to The Times, while not its employees, will be held to the same standards as staff members when they are on Times assignments, including those for the Times Magazine.\"\nAssigning editors in business and financial news who deal with non-staff contributors have a special duty to guard against conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflict. To the extent possible, assigning editors should ensure that outside contributors meet the strict standards outlined in Section 12 above for the business and financial news staff.\nNo staff member may own stock or have any other financial interest in a company, enterprise or industry that figures or is likely to figure in coverage that he or she provides, edits, packages or supervises regularly.\nWhile Guideline #152 reminds editors not to employ freelancers who fall foul of the ethics rules.\n\"If they violate these guidelines, they will be denied further assignments,\" it states. So it looks like Battelle's sparkling prose won't be troubling the Times op-ed readers again.\n\"In short, the theme of the Op-Ed was that 'it's once again safe to invest in the net again'\", notes Garfunkel. He told us that he had mailed the Times public editor but has yet to hear a reply.\nHe also observes, \"ironically, given how much the blogs have ripping the NYTimes these days from TimesSelect to Judy Miller, they give bad journalism a pass when it's sucking up to their interests.\"\nA failure of 'Collective Intelligence', we guess.\nNow given the unanimity of disdain for the Web 2.0 hype - only two out of many hundreds of correspondents defended it in a recent survey - you'd think the Times would be wiser to approach the subject with some scepticism."}

In the last few weeks, we've been told over and over that Googlehoo and the DOJ are hashing out concessions.\nOriginal terms called for Yahoo to choose how many Google search ads it could display and for the deal to last as long as a decade if the parties consented.\nNow the WSJ has said (subscribers only) the parties are talking about truncating the deal's life span from 10 to two years and putting a cap on the revenue Yahoo can generate from the deal to 25 percent of Yahoo's search revenue. The new plan also specifies that \"Google advertisers can opt out of having their ads displayed on Yahoo sites.\"\nLimiting the deal's lifetime is probably a headache for Google and Yahoo, as they laid out the deal the best way they believed it would work for them. Capping the revenue for Yahoo should be a deal breaker in my opinion. Frankly, I can't believe Google and Yahoo are even considering it.\nThe idea is for Yahoo to profit as much as possible with Google's help, but if the DOJ is forcing the cap, it must really believe Google will eventually subsume Yahoo if Yahoo can run Google ads all day, every day with impunity.\nDouglas McIntyre, of BloggingStocks, notes the reason for the cap could be that the DOJ is concerned the companies will raise ad rates. Google and Yahoo have both adamantly denied this, hiding behind the ad auction model.\nMcIntyre is dead on when he writes, \"[Yahoo] needs the supplemental income from Google to impress investors with expanding revenue.\" Capping the deal isn't going to help Yahoo get there.\nMeanwhile, Erick Schonfeld at TechCrunch wonders whether Google and Yahoo are using a stalling tactic until a new presidential administration and new Justice Department officials come into office. I doubt that.\nThe current DOJ is setting the tone for how such potentially monopolistic search ad deals should be addressed. I wouldn't expect those who follow to do anything but pick up that torch and run with it to make a statement: Do not pass go and do not collect $200.\n*Reuters reports that the deal is a \"desperate gambit.\"\nIt's not desperate for Google, which doesn't need to do this deal, but Sanford Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindasy is right when he says it could bog Yahoo down further in the mire, freezing it from even pulling off a deal with AOL.\nIf this deal does get stalled until 2009 because of a showdown with the DOJ, and Yahoo cannot shore up its core businesses, its mass employee defection and embarrassing stock freefall, it will be dead meat."}

Sarkari Feminism has been penned by Anuradha Marwah\u2014a veteran of three novels\u2014who has collaborated with us in the past. See, we are a group of around 70 people who, with every play, try to fight against our own middle-class attitude. It\u2019s only if we are able to question ourselves continuously that we\u2019d ever be able to confront the audience and the ills that lurk within the society.\nWith this play, we go a step further. We plan to confront the audience directly, asking them all the questions straight out, thus turning it into an interactive confrontation. We shall admit to them that we don\u2019t have any solution to the problem of child prostitution or the other problems that women suffer from. And we will ask them if they are ready to incorporate these women into their society: prostitutes or lesbians.\nThe story revolves around a group that has been working for the poor and the marginalized for long and, thanks to a bureaucrat, ties up with a commission that\u2019s been suddenly inspired to work with poor women to perform a feminist play. What follows is a story that puts the middle class-centred activism of all these agencies under the scanner.\nWhat are the kinds of reactions that you get when you perform your plays across India? Does the response differ across geographical and economic boundaries?\nTo be frank, the response doesn\u2019t really vary with different regions. The percentage of conservative radicals doesn\u2019t really vary with regions. We have had our share of scary moments where someone interrupts a play midway to hurl abuses or question our intentions. But what really scares us is the optimism that we tend to instil in people and its long-term fallout. For instance, we have seen 12-year-old girls getting up after or during our performances to shout their protesting, conservative parents down. But I\u2019m aware of the fact that we are sojourning there and would go back in some time. The girl, though, would remain. I\u2019m always afraid of what might happen to her, and others like her, once we leave. To return to your original question though, I would say one thing: If we are doing such a play at both India Habitat Centre (IHC) and, let\u2019s say, Ladakh, the reactions would be more negative out here at IHC.\nLastly, where does pandies go from here? Also, where else will you be performing this play?\nWe are a group that was labelled feminist after our very first play. To be more precise, the press termed our performance of Macbeth, \u201cLady Macbeth and the Witches\" (laughs). We have always been trying to regard and depict feminism as an economic movement rather than a gender movement urging people to explore the other ways of looking at life. We have now fully evolved as an atheist, secular and Left-oriented group. The Left without the political baggage it brings along, though.\nAs for the play, we want to take it to the colleges since we sincerely believe that all change will begin with the youth. We want to gather as much opinion from the people in their 20s as possible. After that, I want to take it anywhere possible."}

And as boundaries of technology are stretched even further with the advent of nanotechnology, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing and artificial intelligence it is clear there has never been a more exhilarating time to see these ideas transform our society.\nIntellectual property is everywhere you look, and someone, somewhere was responsible for the idea, the design, the execution of creating everyday items that you and I often take for granted.\nIn the UK we have an economy thriving with IP rich businesses. And we have an IP regime, consistently one of the very best in the world, that supports these creators and entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to market. Some of the examples I mentioned are just a small collection of what has been created in the UK.\nAnd there are pockets of this blossoming creativity right across the country, from Mulberry in Somerset, to Emma Bridgwater in Stoke-on-Trent, Cavendish pianos in the Yorkshire Dales to Bentley motors in Crewe. These businesses rely on their intellectual property to continue doing what they\u2019re doing, to continue providing vital employment and to continue boosting local economies, supporting our Industrial Strategy and contribute to our determination to get 2.4% of GDP spent on R&D by 2027.\nMake no mistake about it, the government knows how much blood, sweat and tears went into these products and creations, and I can assure you as IP Minister, I will continue to champion the cause to make sure there is continued protection for the IP rights behind them.\nThrough the Government\u2019s Industrial Strategy, we are investing record levels of funding to support research and development, nearly \u00a37 billion by 2021, and we are determined that by 2027, 2.4% of GDP will be spent on research and development, boosting our economy and making sure our innovators have the right support to excel in what they do best. Through our recently published Creative Industries Sector Deal, we are supporting our creative industries more than ever and making sure a robust IP framework exists to protect their work. And through our continued support of our superb enforcement agencies we are making sure that those who infringe IP face the full force of the law.\nAnd we are clearly doing something right.

Aereo uses a tiny HD antenna the size of a dime to pick up the broadcast signal for each of its users, which for now allows it to operate legally. Aereo also provides a DVR feature that lets you record up to 40 hours of content.\nPreviously, Aereo was only available to residents of New York City, but soon it will be available in several cities across the country, including Boston, Miami, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Washington DC, Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Cleveland, Kansas City, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, Birmingham (Ala.), Providence (R.I.), and Madison (Wis.).\nThe expansion will start this spring in the warmer cities and continue through the end of 2013. (The company said it\u2019ll take nearly two months to get the service up and running for beta testing.) These cities represent the first phase of growth for the service, which will eventually roll out in more areas across the country.\nInitially, Aereo will offer access through a beta version of the service, which you can sign up for today on its website. (The company estimates that it\u2019ll grant access to about 1,000 subscribers for the beta.) And like the NYC service, Aereo will offer a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay $1 per day, $8 per month, or $80 per year.\nAt the 2013 CES, Aereo also announced that it closed a new $38 million round today, led by existing investors IAC and Highland Capital Partners, with participation from FirstMark Capital, First Round Capital, High Line Venture Partners, and other previous investors. The additional capital will help pay for the cost of expansion.\nPresumably, the new funding will also help pay for legal expenses related to ongoing copyright infringement claims from major U.S entertainment companies that fear Aereo will disrupt the traditional \u201cpay TV\u201d business model.\nFederal judges denied an earlier claim by 17 media companies to stop Aereo\u2019s service until a final decision can be made on whether or not the company\u2019s method of using tiny antennas to stream broadcast channels is legal. Aereo CEO Chet Kanojia told VentureBeat in a phone interview that it is confident that a final court decision will be in its favor, which is evident since it\u2019s moving forward with its expansion plans.\nMedia companies, many of which are cable TV service providers as well, are concerned that Aereo\u2019s lower pricing and prime-time programming will steal business away from them.

Last month, Aereo reached a deal to bring the Bloomberg business network to its subscribers, a deal that will extend when it launches in other cities later this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very closely with a few people to bring more channels (to Aereo),\u201d Kanojia told VentureBeat, adding that we could hear an announcement about a new channel agreement midway through 2013.

Currently CMO at TSD Global, a large marketing and sales outsourcing company.\nLately, online marketing and sales funnels have been gaining a lot of traction among entrepreneurs, marketers and salespeople, and they should be \u2014 they work like magic. I'm going to show you today why and how you can set up an online marketing funnel for your business.\nConsumers have access to more information than ever before and do a great deal more research before making a purchase. This has increased the price competition and made businesses lower their prices for their products in an attempt to get more customers. The problem with that is companies are essentially selling commodities, and then it's a race to the bottom of whoever can sell their product the cheapest. Online sales funnels allow you drive traffic to your website where you can strategically capture leads through a squeeze page, generate sales, identify dream buyers and upsell your customers.\nTwenty or 30 years ago, the mainstream marketing channel was direct mail. Businesses would send out sales letters and brochures that were disguised as free reports. Business owners used to buy time on television so they could advertise their infomercials. Companies used to advertise on the radio and place ads in the newspaper. Today's marketing channels have completely changed \u2014 though not as much as you may think. Instead of direct mail, businesses use email marketing. Instead of radio ads, companies use podcasts. Instead of buying TV ads, entrepreneurs leverage YouTube ads. So, really, the strategy is the same, but the tactics have changed.\nMy first recommendation to build a successful funnel is to think about who your most successful direct and indirect competitors are. Your direct competitors are the companies selling the exact same product or service as you, and your indirect competitors are selling a different product or service, but they are targeting the same type of customer you're going after.\nThen, I recommend you screenshot or screencast your competitor's entire funnel. This includes their ads, landing pages, upsells and downsells. This is to leverage a funnel that is already performing well so it will ensure that your funnel will be successful. Then model \u2014 not copy \u2014 their funnel from the ads, landing pages, copy and offers because they have proven to work.\nI suggest you also buy ads on the same websites that your competitors are using. All you have to do is use a website analysis tool and plug in your competitor's URL, and you will see where all of their website traffic comes from. Buy ads on the same websites, and you will start converting website visitors into sales. I recommend you get one of your current customers to write a blog post on their website about you, and have them link it to your website to pre-frame all of the traffic that comes from them. You will have built a great deal of credibility, and they will know who you are after they read your customer's case study or blog post.\nWhat Type of Funnel Should I Build?\nThere are three core funnels that any business owner should use: a tripwire, webinar, or high-ticket funnel. A tripwire funnel is a low-ticket offer, priced from free to $30, with the goal of building an email list and gaining customers quickly. A lot of entrepreneurs are using free-plus-shipping offers for CDs, books and USB drives. Basically, they record some amazing videos on what they are selling, put them onto a physical product and market them as free, but the customer pays for the shipping. This works extremely well because not only do you build an email list of leads quickly,"}

From where you stand on the staircase, you grip your M4 between both hands as you peer into the dark hallway.\nAn explosion sounds from a distance and your time starts. Dressed in full combat gear, you and a teammate rush into the long hallway and run toward a room with flickering lights. As you approach the room, the sounds of explosions, gun shots, and cries of terror grow louder.\n\"I was nervous,\" said Spc. Cendy Muro from 15th Transportation Company, 100th Brigade Support Battalion (BSB). \"I didn't know what to expect.\"\nThe visual and audio effects were part of the intent behind the 75th Field Artillery Brigade's (FAB) Tactical Combat Casualty Care-All Combatants Course (TCCC), as well as to arm Soldiers with the requisite training to quickly and definitively assess casualties' wounds to save lives. Soldiers from the 100th BSB and the 2nd Battalion, 20th Field Artillery tested individually on their life-sustaining skills, Feb. 8, to obtain their certification through the TCCC course.\nThe course began Feb. 5, and for four days Soldiers learned how to first, provide life-sustaining aid to casualties, and ultimately, perform such measures under simulated combat conditions. What makes this training different than other brigade combat lifesaver courses, was that this course was more hands-on than previous iterations.\nThe implementation of a hands-on trauma lab into the course was new for the Soldiers and for the brigade's medical team. Currently no Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) exists on post. In the interim, this more in-depth training gap is filled by sending select individuals to the Master Medic Course at Fort Hood, Texas. Medical leaders took it upon themselves to create a more realistic environment for simulated real-world casualty care training.\n\"Normal CLS (Combat Lifesaver) training is usually given in the form of death by PowerPoint; and it doesn't give the Soldiers time to actually comprehend what they need to do,\" said Sgt. 1st Class Frank Citizen, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 75th FAB medical noncommissioned officer in charge and the primary instructor of the course.\nPrevious CLS courses relied heavily on slide presentations, and the only physical aspect of the course was of Soldiers practicing learned skills on a training aid. The course this week focused more around the tactical side and medicine, said Citizen, who attended the Master Medic Course in December at Fort Hood to build his skills as a medical professional and bring that expertise back to the unit.\n\"We're forcing their minds to actually implement basic battle drills into their assessments,\" Citizen said.\nAccording to Muro, even though the TCCC course, often referred to as \"T Triple C,\" began the first day in a classroom with a written test; by the second day students were getting hands-on experience and applying the things they learned. The course was taught by Citizen and medics under him.\nOn the final day, Soldiers applied what they learned in a test of their ability to aid a casualty under a stress-induced simulation.

Did you miss it? It was last year's highest grossing foreign-language film, but it made less than eight million dollars. The fact is that selling foreign language films to U.S. audiences is a notorious challenge. Nevertheless, Fox, one of the world's most powerful media conglomerates, is beefing up its investment in foreign films.\nHow does Rupert Murdoch expect to make money that way, given the tiny audiences for foreign movies? Well, it turns out Fox is making them for their own local markets. A Chinese film called Love In Space earned $10 million in China. A German hit called What A Man made $12 million in Germany. And a hugely scaled Russian epic about the Bolshevik revolution pulled in a very aristocratic $50 million in Russia.\nNone of these hit local films saw a real release in the U.S. (Love In Space played briefly in New York.) All were co-produced by Fox International and local partners \u2014 sometimes sister media companies and sometimes independent local film companies. Sanford Panitch runs the division from Los Angeles. He says if you want to make money selling films internationally, you might assume you do it by exporting big Hollywood blockbusters. But overlooking local movies is overlooking significant markets.\n\"China is the second or third biggest market in the world at 50 percent local,\" he says. \"India the fourth biggest at 90 percent local, France at 40 percent local, Germany at 30 percent local, Korea a billion dollar market 50 percent, Japan \u2014 actually, Japan [is] the biggest international market in the world, 60 percent local.\"\nFox International Productions actually started off three years ago with a Japanese version of the movie Sideways -- that's the one about two guys touring wine country. \"When we originally got into the business,\" Panitch says, we thought, 'We've got this great library, let's take advantage of it.' And ironically, local markets don't want recycled Hollywood content.\"\nAnd really, why would they? Bollywood hardly needs need old American ideas. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has refreshed Hollywood's interest in stories from abroad. That's not a Fox picture, but Panitch says his division is introducing foreign books, scripts and directors to the larger Fox system.\n\"There's a new aesthetic that's coming out of people that werent' schooled in traditional Hollywood ways,\" he says. \"There's an incestuousness creatively here where we're all reading the same publications and listening to the same music.\"\nOne of Fox international's latest successes comes from Mexico.

Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern is, it seems, perfectly comfortable on the other side of the microphone.\nEven so, Des Cahill needn't worry. His job on RTE's The Road To Croker is certainly safe, no matter how long he stays in Beijing. Yes, Bertie surely drew the audiences last night when he pitched up to Paidi O Se's pub in Ventry for his first stint at television presenting, but we were always suckers for a big name.\nEven Bill O'Herlihy was finding it hard to contain his enthusiasm last night.

Had Dublin won, it would have made his trip down to the south a little more enjoyable. Instead, as he mournfully told us, he was subjected to a severe ribbing from the Kerry supporters.\nClearly on good terms with his autocue, the newly civilianised Bertie Ahern was doing his best to present a relaxed front during last night's show.

Instead of bluffing his way through the meaningless rambling that characterised his time as Taoiseach, last night his speech was perfectly polished.\nHe even managed to lament the \"Tyrone tornado that swept down from the north\" as he spoke of Dublin's defeat last weekend.

{"idx": "8382", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Intel Corp., the world's leading manufacturer of microprocessors, recently announced an unprecedented agreement with the Energy Department under which the government will use the Pentium processor design to develop radiation-hardened chips for spacecraft, satellites and other defense systems.\nUnder the licensing agreement, Sandia National Laboratories will design a version of the Pentium processor that can withstand the high levels of X-ray radiation present in the so-called Van Allen Belts, which are radiation belts that circle the globe.\nBecause many satellites and other space vehicles operate within the Van Allen Belts, it is necessary to shield, or \"harden,\" them against the degrading effects of radiation [FCW, Aug. 17]. Satellites now operating within the Van Allen Belts rely on hardened chips that are manufactured specifically for that use. These chips are bigger, use more power and are more expensive to produce than typical commercial chips.\nThe agreement marks the first time anyone has tried to produce a radiation-hardened chip from a processor as small as Intel's Pentium processor.\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson said that with the agreement \"a fundamental shift has indeed occurred\" in the microprocessor field. According to Richardson, the teaming arrangement with Intel will save taxpayers millions of dollars, with the first prototype hitting the street within three years.\nIn addition, the deal is expected to benefit the commercial communications industry, which was hit hard this past summer by a pager disruption that may have been caused by the effects of radiation, Richardson said.\nUnder the agreement, the new chip design will be turned over to commercial manufacturers for production in the United States only. The partnership also includes NASA; the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which manages the nation's fleet of spy satellites; and the Air Force Research Laboratory.\n\"Providing a license to Sandia will aid in the implementation of processing power\" in the space and national defense environments, said Craig Barrett, president and chief executive officer of Intel. \"It's a wonderful example of how industry and government can work together.\"\nAccording to John Crawford, executive vice president of Sandia, the new radiation-hardened version of the Pentium will be compatible with the commercial chips found in PCs and will run software currently developed for the Intel platform.\nNASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said the government would never have the production capability to undertake such a project without Intel's help.

Educators will picket schools across Denver beginning at 7 a.m., according to a DCTA release.\nThe two sides are expected to come together Friday evening for one last bargaining session before Monday\u2019s strike. The main sticking point is increasing pay and lessening teachers' reliance on one-time bonuses.\nUnion members announced Wednesday that educators would walk off the job after Governor Jared Polis declined to intervene in contract negotiations, hoping both sides will work through the weekend to come to an agreement.\n\"This represents an 11th-hour opportunity over the next few days for both sides to close the gap over these limited, remaining issues,\" Polis said.\nDPS officials said they believe an agreement will be reached. However, union officials don\u2019t appear to be confident that a resolution is near.\n\"No teacher wants to strike, we would rather be teaching students in our classrooms,\" Denver teacher and association President Henry Roman said in a statement. \"But when the strike starts, we will be walking for our students.\"\nThe district will also be hosing three job fairs \u2014 Friday, Tuesday and Thursday \u2014 at its downtown headquarters to bring new teachers onboard.\nIt would cost the district an estimated cost of $400,000 a day to keep schools operating with substitutes and administrators.\nHowever, school board member Jennifer Bacon said a strike would impact students the most.\nThe union, which represents 5,635 educators in the Denver Public School system, has been trying to negotiate a new pay structure with Denver Public Schools for the past 14 months. In January, DCTA voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike.\nThe walkout has been on hold as the state decided whether to intervene at the school district's request. The labor department's involvement could have put a strike on hold for up to 180 days.\nDPS has set up a website to provide resources for families to help them plan for a strike. DPS said among the most important things parents can do to prepare for a strike is to ensure their student\u2019s contact information is updated in the Parent Portal and that medication information is up-to-date.

And in Washington on Thursday, President Obama delivered what he said was a new vision for US foreign policy in the Middle East. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nBARACK OBAMA, US PRESIDENT: The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine. We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves and reach their full potential in a sovereign and contiguous state. As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat. Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security. The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state.\nJAY: Now joining us from Ramallah, Palestine, to give his views on President Obama\u2019s speech is Omar Barghouti. Omar is independent Palestinian researcher, commentator, and human rights activist. He\u2019s a founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel and a Palestinian civil society boycott, disinvestment, and sanctions campaign against Israel. So, Omar, what is your reaction to the speech in general, and then more specifically about Israel and Palestine?\nOMAR BARGHOUTI, INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: I just want to comment on one specific line in this speech which may say it all. President Obama said that the Arab democratic spring has made al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden irrelevant even before he was executed by US forces. There\u2019s another person who has become almost irrelevant by the Arab democratic spring, and that\u2019s President Obama. I don\u2019t know how long it will take him to realize that, but he\u2019s becoming less and less relevant to people in the region. As everyone in the West was waiting by their TVs to watch him, hardly anyone cared in our region, in our part of the world\u2013maybe Netanyahu, and maybe Mahmoud Abbas. But for most people I know of, including commentators, analysts, and so on, hardly anyone cared, really, what Obama had to say, because (A) no one expected him to say anything new, and, lo and behold, he did not say anything really new. Two, even if he said something new, who cares?\nJAY: You say what President Obama says is somewhat irrelevant in the region, but at the same time, the United States is still a major funder to Israel, and both in terms of money and military support; also for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries\u2013Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and so on. It\u2019s still the behemoth in the region. So why wouldn\u2019t people care what President Obama has to say?\nBARGHOUTI: Oh, absolutely. No one is denying that the US is the main partner of Israel in committing its crimes against Palestinians and other Arabs. No one denies that US complicity is the reason why we have so many dictatorships in our region. So no one is denying that."}

In February 2016, we (the Legion) were unable to come up with the money, so I asked the commissioners for another five-year extension. I was denied.\nPrior to asking for the extension, a new group was forming, and they were going to get a grant to buy the building. A feasibility study was made, and it was going to cost $600,000 to $800,000 to bring the building up to code. Needless to say, they did not pursue the matter any further.\nIn the meantime, the VFW asked us to join up with them in their building, and we moved. We paid $700 per month for rent.\nNow, the county was stuck with an empty building.\nAfter a year with the VFW, we drafted a new lease and formed a house committee to take care of the monthly maintenance. Each organization was to put $500 into the account, and the house committee would take care of normal monthly maintenance.\nA meeting was called, and the district commander of the VFW told us the rent will be $1,500 per month.

{"idx": "8392", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Why the U.S. Army's focus on nation-building at the expense of warfighting is misguided and dangerous.\nThe U.S. military is still too focused on conventional warfare.\nAbsolutely not. In fact, over the past six-plus years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Army has become a counterinsurgency-only force. The notion that there are still some conventional-minded bogeymen lurking in the shadows and waiting for the chance to take the Army back to the 1980s so that it can prepare to fight the Soviets in the Fulda Gap is a chimera.\nThere are understandable reasons why the Army has become so focused on counterinsurgency: The operational demands of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan demand it. Counterinsurgency expert John Nagl is thus correct when he calls for winning the wars we are in now. Currently, when Army combat brigades go to any of the national training centers for preparation for deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq, they primarily train on counterinsurgency operations.\nYet the Army has allowed its understandable operational focus on counterinsurgency to dominate its current intellectual climate. Three Army colonels, all former combat brigade commanders in Iraq, warned Army Chief of Staff General George Casey last year that field artillery, because of its recent focus on counterinsurgency operations, had lost its traditional warfighting skills and had become a dead branch walking.\nThe group of counterinsurgency experts within the Army and other parts of the greater U.S. defense establishment, moreover, has narrowly selected and employed a certain, situational form of counterinsurgency operations called the population centric approach. It\u2019s really nothing more than a rehash of the counter-Maoist approaches of the 1960s formulated by Sir Robert Thompson, a British officer in Malaya, and David Galula, a French officer in Algeria. This narrow approach \u2014 known in the current military vernacular as clear, hold, and build \u2014 dominates the Army so much that it permeates the service\u2019s professional journals. Now, whenever a problem of instability or insurgency presents itself, it\u2019s the only approach that seems to be considered, yet different situations might call for different methods. In this sense, the Army has become dogmatic.\nSmall wars are the wars of the future.\nPerhaps. But for the Army, the term small wars has become synonymous with nation-building. The future of war certainly holds more than that.\nIndeed, the dustbin of history is full of mistaken predictions about the future nature of war. An aide to Josef Stalin told the Russian dictator in 1939 that mechanized warfare was not the wave of the future. German armored columns proved that prediction utterly wrong when they came sweeping across the Russian steppes in the summer 1941. Between World War I and World War II, the British saw the future of conflict more in terms of policing their empire rather than major battles fought between land armies. Their muddled thinking led, at least in part, to the near-disaster for the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940 and its fortunate evacuation from Dunkirk.\nMore recently, the Israeli Army that stumbled its way into south Lebanon in 2006 received a sharp response by Hezbollah fighters who operated like-small unit infantry. One of the reasons for the Israeli Army\u2019s poor performance (as shown by analysts like Mat Matthews and Avi Kober) was their heavy focus on counterinsurgency operations in the Palestinian territories for the six"}

Actually I am pretty confident that these necessary but temporary measures will not be needed in the next days or weeks. It was necessary in order to verify that the confidence remains in our banking system. I do believe that the experience of the issue of the banking system has been a positive surprise to everyone.

It is something that is on the agenda but is not something which we are tackling now.\" \"I think parliament will acknowledge that there is no alternative really at this point. I wish there was, but there is not, we are actually paying the cost, the price rather, of mistakes, indecision, false estimates and assessments of the past. We are paying the price of imbalances, both in our public sector and in our banking sector. We acknowledge our mistakes, we are ready to tackle them, to fix them and to move ahead. There is no alternative.\" Cyprus is not giving priority to a sale of gold reserves under the international bailout agreed this month and is still exploring all options to meet its side of the deal, says Cypriot finance minister Harris Georgiades. He also told Reuters he anticipated currency controls, imposed after a chaotic bailout last month and which led to a lockdown of the banking system for 15 days would be eased in \"days or weeks\". Cyprus' agreement to sell 400 million euros worth of its gold reserves was one of several shockwaves its progress towards a bailout sent through European financial markets earlier this month. The amount is small but the precedent of a euro zone central bank being pushed to dispose of some of its reserves helped drive the biggest fall in gold prices in 30 years. Investors worry central banks in some of the euro zone's struggling larger economies could eventually be pushed to follow Cyprus' example. Teetering on the edge of default, Cyprus last month wound down its second largest bank and raided depositors' uninsured savings at another bank to fund a recapitalisation. Both banks were badly hit by their exposure to Greece. It has to come up with most of the 23 billion itself, with only 10 billion made available by lenders and a fractious parliament, which had rejected milder terms of a broad-based bail-in on bank depositors in March, will have to approve the bailout in coming days. Cyprus imposed capital controls at the end of March, worried about a flight of funds from a banking system flush with cash from Russian and European businesses, but also from many overseas Cypriots."}

But the hot water needed to kill bacteria is way too hot to be comfortable to use when washing your hands.\nLuckily, studies have proven that hot water is not necessary to use while hand washing. In fact, a new study published in the Journal of Food Protection found that cool water is just as effective at removing bacteria in handwashing as hot water. More than 20 participants were tracked for six months and instructed to wash their hands in 60, 79 and 100 degree water using varying amounts of soap. Researchers found the 60-degree water cleaned hands just as well as the hot water.\nAnd in a 2005 study documented in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, participants were instructed to wash their hands in water ranging from 40 degrees all the way up to 120 degrees. What the study found is that the temperature of the water doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to getting your hands truly clean.\nThe FDA recommends washing dishes at an uncomfortable 110 degrees as one of the steps to get rid of harmful bacteria. Interestingly, even though the FDA recommends washing your dishes at 110 degrees as one of its bacteria-killing steps, studies have shown that washing dishes in colder water can kill bacteria too. The difference may be in how quickly the grease comes off. Anecdotally, I can tell you that hot water makes for much easier scrubbing, as the remnants of a greasy meatball and spaghetti dinner just roll off the plate with hot water. Cold water can do the job too \u2014 it\u2019ll just take more time.\nSo what really does the job of getting rid of germs and bacteria when you\u2019re washing your hands? Turns out time has a lot to do with it. A study at Northwestern University showed that people who washed their hands with soap for just five seconds did nothing to kill the germs on their hands. Conversely, people who washed their hands with soap for 30 seconds killed everything. As they teach my son in school \u2014 sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d two times while you\u2019re scrubbing \u2014 that\u2019s about how long it\u2019ll take for your hand washing to really be effective. Also, don\u2019t forget to scrub all the surfaces of your hands \u2014 in between your fingers, under your fingernails, and the backs of your hands too.\nRemember, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, effective hand washing is the single most important defense against the spread of disease and infection. As a matter of fact, Oct. 15 is Global Handwashing Day \u2014 a day solely dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of washing your hands with soap.\nIs there a difference between plain old soap and antibacterial soap? According to the Mayo Clinic, no. And antibacterial soap may even be detrimental to use, potentially causing bacteria to become resistant to the soap\u2019s antimicrobial properties.\nAnd of course, when you\u2019re done, make sure to dry your hands on a clean, dry towel.\nThe bottom line? Though it\u2019s true that warm water may be more comfortable for you to wash your hands with, it is not any more effective than cold water at getting rid of germs. And using cold water could save you a few cents too. Now that\u2019s a"}

Different guy running it.\nRosier, who said he put too much air under the pass and not enough on it to get it to Thomas, finished 14 of 29 passing for 110 yards and two interceptions and with 19 yards rushing on 10 carries. Both of his interceptions Saturday came off deflections \u2013 one off a Clemson defensive lineman who got his hand in the air and another off the hands of an open Darrell Langham.\nAnother time, Rosier found Thomas wide open for an 18-yard gain on a well thrown ball. Then, Thomas had it ripped out of hands and Clemson recovered the fumble at the UM 47.\nCritical Canes fans, already upset with how Rosier played at Pittsburgh, would be accurate in putting some of the blame on its quarterback and his offensive line for how this season has gone from a goose-bumpy 10-0 to such a deflating feeling over the last two weeks.\nBut it\u2019s hard to place blame all on Rosier\u2019s shoulders \u2014 especially with Miami\u2019s three best weapons in Mark Walton, Ahmmon Richards and Chris Herndon all out for the season and not playing in Saturday\u2019s showdown against the No. 1 team in the country.\n\u201cFor the most part, we thought he was making good decisions in trying to go to the right guy,\u201d Richt said of Rosier\u2019s performance Saturday. \u201cI think, you know, a few balls got batted. Some protection broke down from time to time. He missed a shot or two.\nClemson\u2019s defense limited the Hurricanes 214 yards total offense and 10 first downs. The Tigers, ranked sixth nationally in total defense, held Auburn to 117 total yards earlier this season and South Carolina to 207 yards a week ago. So what they did to an ailing, shorthanded Hurricanes team playing for the 11th week in a row was hardly surprise.\nRosier at least was willing to take some of the blame for the Canes\u2019 struggles.\nWhen you face the facts, Rosier wasn\u2019t even the guy Richt was convinced would win the starting job going into training camp.\nIn the end, he led Miami further than Jacory Harris, Stephen Morris or Brad Kaaya ever did. He guided the Canes into the ACC title game and made a lot of big throws in narrow wins over Georgia Tech, Syracuse and Florida State to get them there.\nThe thing is for Rosier \u2014 a 6-1, 216-pound redshirt junior \u2014 is that he\u2019s going to have to convince Richt again he\u2019s really the guy next season.

Below she shares her approach to a few familiar basics, specially tailored for gardening with the kiddos, from her book Roots, Shoots, Buckets & Boots.\nIn gardens where grown-ups share adventures and victories with children, there are more things blooming than flowers and trees. Here's what you need to know to make your garden a place where you and the kids grow together.\nSince children can easily feel overwhelmed by long lists of chores or extended work periods, chop gardening time into short blocks.\nChoose a different area each day and work together for ten minutes.\nCelebrate a day of weeding with a ten-minute weeding contest.\nOrganize a task force to \"uncrowd the plants\" with a ten-minute transplanting.\nKids love to do the watering. Sharon also recommends some junior-size tools to appeal to your child's own sense of scale.\nI always tell my small helpers that I treat my plants the way I want to be treated. I wouldn't want to go through a hot summer day without a drink, and plants shouldn't have to suffer through a dry day either. If plants are thirsty, give them a long, deep drink \u0097 enough water to soak the ground around them to a depth of at least 3 inches.\nKids love to water. They'll never check to make sure they've satisfied their ten-minute goal with this job. Teach them to do the \"poke test\" before they water: Push a finger an inch or so into the soil. If it feels dry, water deeply. If it's moist, don't water. When plants sit day after day in soggy ground, their roots may rot. Be sure to direct the stream of liquid at the base of the plants, not the fragile leaves or stems \u0097 especially if they are small.\nWater early in the morning, so the moisture soaks into the earth instead of evaporating in the hot, midday sun, and don't use any more water than necessary. Collect rain and runoff from the roof of your house in buckets and barrels.\nRed wheatberry is a great choice for growing names or initials in no time. Kids enjoy the rapid results of fast-growing plants.\nLike people, plants need nutrients to grow. I recommend using organic fertilizers because they break down slowly and provide the plants with a steady supply of nutrients. Examples of organics include compost and aged, bagged manure, which you add when preparing the soil, and liquid kelp and fish emulsion, which you apply during growing season.\nFor convenience and health reasons I recommend buying bagged manure for your gardens. This manure goes through a pasteurization process that destroys bacteria and pesky weed seeds.\nWhen fertilizing your plants, always moisten the soil with clear water first. If fertilizer is applied directly onto dry soil, it may burn the plant's roots.\nStop! Before you pull a weed, examine it and compare it to the plants nearby to make sure it's not one of them. Look at the shape of the leaves, for example, and how they are arranged on the stem.\nPull weeds by hand or use a stirrup hoe, then gather them up and dump them on the compost heap.\nChildren like to deadhead; just saying the word"}

I drove the mile to the library on a sunny day to write this review instead of taking my bicycle (time pressure was my excuse although I still managed to read a battery of periodicals before starting this). 3.) I was inclined to like Dan Price\u2019s book Radical Simplicity and read it straight through. Of course, you can see by numbers one and two that I live in a delusional world where wishes and reality rarely meet and number three? Well, that\u2019s just throwing gasoline on everything.And yet, that is one of the charms of Radical Simplicity. The author is very honest about some of the contradictions he presents (for example, he notes the critical importance of a life mate but cannot change the lifestyle that drives said life mate away - she wasn\u2019t willing to live in a tipi complete with outhouse and sweatlodge), nevertheless, he conducts his life with a certain integrity that seems so sincere that to follow any other path would be the true lie. Another example. He sells his car, walks 350 miles home, praises the merits of riding a bicycle, but, when his life stumbles into a phase where he needs a car again, he gets a car. (For the record, the self-subsistence off-grid tome, Living the Good Life, states that the one thing they could not do without was their pickup truck).\nRadical Simplicity is not really a guide to living a life where less is more, rather, one man\u2019s story about evolving a lifestyle which reflects this attitude. If the advanced minimalist finds the philosophical component of Mr. Price\u2019s efforts a bit thin, consider the fact that it is a twenty-odd year journey of self-discovery in which he doesn\u2019t necessarily know the answers and doesn\u2019t consider it a violation of his principles when he finally installs a hot shower of sorts or invests in an expensive copier [although his practice of dismantling, filling in and selling (as in tipi fabric), recycling or burning previous domiciles gives him a harsh introduction to the concept of equity when approaching the banker for copier loan]. And because we have the benefit of twenty years experimentation, the evolution of his less is more takes on a certain sophistication that lends itself to the phases everyone\u2019s life passes through, or, in other senses, the reality that confronts his utopian lifestyle such as theft and ants.\nWhen I summed the merits of this book up and asked myself whether or not it is worth $12.95, one thought flashed through my mind: You might not use Dan Price\u2019s tips to help build your Hobbit hole, but if this book helps you trim 500 square feet off your next real estate purchase, then it\u2019s a value."}

But not many people are talking about the other big change in the 3-year-old show that will take effect starting tonight: Its hourlong format will be shortened to only a half an hour per week. This in itself seems like a loss\u2014I always liked the fact that, unlike most newsmagazines, Now had a leisurely pace to match Moyers\u2019 Texas drawl. There was always that long reported piece at the beginning, an interview with an author or newsmaker in the middle, and then a discussion between two policy experts\u2014often the Laurel-and-Hardy team of Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Kevin Phillips\u2014before the op-ed wrapup at the end. I wonder which segment(s) will get the ax next season? A representative for the show told me that plans for restructuring it were still up in the air, but that on-site reportage by Brancaccio would play a bigger role next year. Whatever the new format, those extra 30 minutes will be missed, along with Moyers, who was especially astute at interviewing artists\u2014his conversation with Maurice Sendak early this year was among the most intimate and moving encounters I\u2019ve seen on a TV news show.\nIn other news: What\u2019s this about HBO\u2019s The Wire possibly not being picked up for a fourth season? It\u2019s bad enough that this gritty, brainy show about the Baltimore drug trade hasn\u2019t yet won, or even been nominated for, any Emmys or Golden Globes. (One reader wrote in suggesting that the awards-giving establishment might have a wee bit of a race problem \u2026 gee, ya think?)

Even better, lawmakers should aim higher - at, say, a $200 billion package, as now proposed by Democrats and desired by many Republicans.\nWhat's going on in Washington, it becomes increasingly clear, is a contest of one-upmanship. In his State of the Union address Mr. Reagan called for a $100 billion deficit-reduction ''down payment.'' Since then, both Democrats and Republicans have been raising the ante. Obviously, the Republicans, with their $ 150 billion package, want to preempt the Democrats. Democrats have replied by calling for a $200 billion package.\nGiven the sheer magnitude of the deficits - at least $600 billion in red ink through fiscal year 1987 - a little bit of one-upmanship isn't all that bad. Who knows, a few more months of such horse-trading and we might have a genuinely meaningful deficit-reduction plan.\nThe Reagan-Senate GOP package includes $48 billion in new taxes, mainly through closing various loopholes; $43 billion in domestic spending cuts, mainly through cuts and benefit adjustments in medicare and medicaid; and $57 billion in defense savings through reductions or slowdowns in certain programs. Mr. Reagan, in other words, has finally backed down on defense. He has repeatedly insisted that he wanted an increase in military spending authority for fiscal year 1985 of 13 percent (after adjusting for inflation). According to the White House, under the agreement reached with GOP senators, spending authority would increase by 5.1 percent (after inflation) in fiscal year 1985; by 5.0 percent in fiscal 1986; by 4.9 percent in fiscal 1987. Using another method of computing defense spending, the increase for fiscal 1985 would be 7.5 percent.\nDemocrats will no doubt study the defense proposals carefully to make certain that the numbers are what they appear to be. Additional reductions could be achieved without hurting national defense.\nThe temptation to block an agreement could surface at any time during this election year. But the American public would not take kindly to Washington's scuttling an effective deficit reduction package."}

And financiers such as investment bank Goldman Sachs have made investments such as Goldman's stake in Imaging Advantage, a privately-held firm that this month partnered with outpatient radiology center operator RadNet to introduce cloud-based radiology services to hundreds of centers across the country.\nThe stocks of these companies could grab some momentum as they sign more clients such as large hospital systems. Hospital operators, too, could benefit, as they are under pressure to accept risk, improve outcomes, and cut down on unnecessary test-ordering under value-based care contracts.\nMRIs alone can cost up to $2,000 each. Reducing the unnecessary number of these tests and avoiding duplication can mean higher profit margins for hospitals and insurance companies.\n\"Almost every American entering the healthcare system receives a diagnostic test to find out what's wrong or if nothing's wrong,\" Hashim said. \"A third are unnecessary, and a significant percentage are simply read incorrectly.\"\nThe U.S. spends $2 trillion a year on healthcare, which is 16% of the nation's gross domestic product. Diagnostic imaging costs are one of the fastest-growing segments of the healthcare economy, accounting for nearly $100 billion a year.\nWhen hospitals and doctor groups agree to take on financial risk in a \"bundled payment\" contract with an insurance company or government health programs such as Medicare, they agree that they can provide the necessary quality medical care for one bundled fee, grouping all of the services involved in an episode. Thus, they need to make sure they get the diagnostic test done right the first time, or they won't make money on the bundled fee.\nTo help hospitals and doctors lower their costs, cloud-based technology is being used to link radiologists and facilities to make sure X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans are read promptly and accurately.\n\"Merge will become part of IBM's new Watson Health business unit, bolstering IBM clients' ability to analyze and cross-reference medical images against 315 billion data points already in the Watson Health Cloud, including lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies, and other health-related data sources,\" IBM said in announcing the deal. \"Insights generated by Watson could then help healthcare providers and researchers to pursue more personalized approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients.\"\nGeneral Electric, too, is a recent entrant into the space.

As we learned this week, the April 22 swarm robbery by an unknown number of juveniles at Oakland's Coliseum Station has already lead to a civil lawsuit, or the beginnings of one, with one Dublin family of three suing BART for $3 million for negligence and damages. Now, as the Chronicle reports, we're learning a bit more about the timeline of events that Saturday night, in which a group of 30 to 60 teenagers stormed the station, jumped the fare gates, and ran up to the platform.\nIt turns out they did not time their arrival to coincide with the arriving Dublin/Pleasanton train, but in fact got there a minute or two before that train arrived in the station. We heard earlier that a call went out to BART police who were reportedly patrolling the station parking lot at the time and it apparently took them more than four minutes to return to the station, by which time the gang of teens had left.\nNow we learn, per the Chronicle and confirmed by BART, that there was an arriving San Francisco-bound train in the station first, and some teens boarded that train and caused some disturbance but then got off the train without committing any crimes.\nA question raised by the attorney for that Dublin family is why the operator of the Dublin/Pleasanton train didn't override the train doors when he saw the mob of teens on the platform who subsequently were banging on doors and windows before the train had even come to a stop. Just days later it took only four teens jumping fare gates at Lake Merritt station to cause a train to completely bypass the station without opening its doors, out of caution.\nBART spokesperson Alicia Trost now tells the Chronicle that the train operator \"hadn\u2019t been advised of the fare evasion, since it had just occurred moments before,\" and that operators are trained to look at the tracks as they approach the station to avoid hitting anything or anyone that may be in them, and this operator perhaps did not have a chance to see any commotion happening on the platform.\nThere may have been some breakdown in communication, though, between the station agent and dispatch, because Trost says, \"The operator hadn\u2019t received word not to allow [the doors to open], since the police had just been called moments before.\" and she says that \"the intercom notices [from passengers] started to happen [after the doors had opened] and the operator immediately called it in.\"\nThe information about the group running onto the SF-bound train first, which was caught on surveillance video, further calls to question why the station agent didn't act faster in this case.\nNeedless to say, the details of the incident are going to continue trickling out, and we should be seeing another lawsuit or two fairly soon."}

The deals involve companies shifting their legal address overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates. Recent examples include Burger King\u2019s US:BKW buying of Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons US:THI , and AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ABBV, +0.31% purchase of Shire PLC US:SHPG .\nSchumer\u2019s bill targets what\u2019s known as earnings stripping, which involves inverted companies loading their U.S. subsidiaries with debt. When the subsidiary repays the overseas parent, interest payments are then deductible from U.S. taxes. That allows the companies to avoid paying high U.S. taxes: the U.S. corporate rate of 35% is the world\u2019s highest.\nThe bill would halve the amount of deduction companies may claim, among other measures. Schumer introduced the bill with Sen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew said Monday the Obama administration will decide in the \u201cvery near future\u201d about how to address inversions. Schumer said he\u2019s \u201call for\u201d Lew doing whatever he can to address the issue, but that the secretary would \u201cbe the first to admit that it can\u2019t be as effective\u201d or workable as legislation.\nHere is a condensed, edited transcript of MarketWatch\u2019s interview with Schumer, who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.\nMarketWatch: What\u2019s different about this inversion bill than the others we\u2019ve seen so far, and is there a better chance of passage in this environment?\nSchumer: What\u2019s different in this bill is we focus on earnings strippings, which is the most egregious part of inversions because companies would be able to shield their U.S. earnings. That\u2019s a little different than trying to get lower corporate rates on foreign stuff.\nIn terms of getting Republican support, I\u2019ve talked to a few of my Republican colleagues about this, about saying, let this expire in 2017. In other words, eliminate the earnings stripping aspect of inversions until 2017. Let it expire as an impetus for broad tax reform. I think everybody agrees it is far preferable to do broad tax reform and lower rates than little, bit-by-bit pieces.\nWhat this would do would say to the new Congress in 2017 and the new president, if you don\u2019t do tax reform, these inversions are going to come back at you because this provision will expire. So it\u2019s an impetus for tax reform in that way and in another way, because companies that aren\u2019t allowed to invert will put more pressure on the system to do corporate tax reform.\nIf each company can choose its own little loophole then our corporate tax code will continue to be a Swiss cheese that favors some over others simply because of fortuitous circumstances.\nMarketWatch: How did you decide to focus on this particular aspect?

Council members who opposed the pit bull ban argued that the city should focus on better enforcing the non-breed specific ordinance.\nDespite public outcry, in October, City Council passed the pit bull ban in a 5-4 vote.\nThe Springfield-Greene County Health Department had strongly recommended banning pit bulls.

The Bucks, who have won three straight and seven of eight, extended their NBA-best record to 25-10.\nThey nearly squandered their big lead after the Nets went on a 14-0 run in the fourth, and Shabazz Napier's 7-footer with 4:51 left trimmed the deficit to seven.\n\"I think there was a pretty major lapse, the start of the fourth quarter,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.\nMiddleton and Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' two best players, reasserted control.\nAfter a bucket by Middleton, Antetokounmpo scored six straight and also drew a charge on former teammate Jared Dudley in a 57-second span of the fourth that ended with the Bucks rebuilding a 15-point lead with 3:10 left. The Bucks were back on their way to their third straight win and seventh in eight games.\n\"He was phenomenal in the last five minutes,\" Budenholzer said.\nBut a 6-foot-11 forward known for making highlight reels drew social media buzz after a dunk attempt in the first quarter was blocked by Nets center Jarrett Allen.\nLeave it to Antetokounmpo to finish strong.\n\"That's what a superstar does. When it's crunch time, when it's time to close a game out \u2014 he did it,\" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said.\nNapier tied his career high with 32 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field and 10 of 12 from the foul line. Kenneth Faried had 21 points and 10 rebounds.\nMilwaukee's Brook Lopez added 24 points on 7-of-15 shooting from the 3-point arc.

Those who don't avail themselves of subcutaneous microchips and other implanted technology, he predicts, will be at a serious disadvantage in tomorrow's world, because they won't be able to communicate with the \"superintelligent machines\" sure to be occupying the highest rungs of society, as he explains in a 2003 documentary, Building Gods, which is circulating online.\nSomething of a self-promoter, Warwick, or \"Captain Cyborg\" as a U.K. newspaper once dubbed him, has appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and other shows on the TV talk circuit to tout his work. In his 2004 book, I, Cyborg, he describes his research as \"the extraordinary story of my adventure as the first human entering into a cyber world.\"\nMore reserved in conversation, Warwick says he wants to advance brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMI) beyond current studies in nonhuman primates, such as a recent experiment that synched up a pair of robot legs with a jogging, BMI-outfitted monkey. He says the short-term benefits could be smarter prosthetics for amputees, infrared-based sensory systems for the blind and brain implants to treat Parkinson's disease.\nDaniela Cerqui, an anthropology professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, who has followed Warwick's work since 2004, says she \"met people very fascinated with what he was doing.\" She adds: \"I also met engineers who didn't think what he was doing was real science.\"\nIn 1998 Warwick was one of the first people to have a simple digital transmitter known as a radio-frequency identification device (RFID) implanted just below the skin in his upper left arm. For nine glorious days doors parted and lights switched on for him in the University of Reading Department of Cybernetics as the RFID alerted different sensors to Warwick's approach. In 2002 he had electrodes implanted in the nerves of his left forearm (prudent for a right-hander).\nHe used the implant to enslave the robot hand far away in Reading, an electric wheelchair and the lights in his lab as well as to communicate with his wife, Irena. She had agreed to receive a similar implant to see if hus-borg and wife could exchange electrical signals. \"If she moved her hand,\" Warwick says, \"my nervous system received one pulse. If she moved her hand three times, I received three pulses.\"\nHe hopes to have a sensor implanted in his brain by 2015 that will allow him to send signals across a computer network.

Coat things like fruit and chocolate chips in flour before adding them to your mix.\n\"This prevents all the bits from sinking to the bottom and ensures you\u2019ve got an even distribution of flavour.\"\n5. Use an ice cream scoop to portion your muffins and cupcakes.\n\"When I make muffins or cupcakes, I use a small ice cream scoop to fill the liners. It gives me perfect proportions every time.\"\n6. Swap vanilla extract for vanilla bean paste.\n\"The flavour is more similar to using a real vanilla bean, and you get those little black vanilla seeds as proof of how fancy you and your cake/frosting/whatever you\u2019re making is.\"\n7. Spoon flour into your measuring cup instead of scooping it.\n\"When measuring flours, don\u2019t scoop with your measuring cup. Spoon flour into your measuring cup and level it with a knife.\"\n8. But it's a good idea to look for recipes measured in grams or pounds instead of cups.\n\"By getting recipes with the ingredients in grams or pounds, you will see more exactness in your final products.\"\n9. Don't be afraid of using salt.\n\"People always assume that because it's a dessert it doesn't need salt \u2014 I can't stress enough that salt is the missing ingredient in so many dishes! \"\n10. If you need to used chilled butter, grate it and freeze it for about an hour beforehand.\n\"When recipes call for chilled butter (pie crust, biscuits, and the like), grate the butter ahead of time and put it in the freezer for an hour or so before incorporating it into the recipe. Since it's already quite cold and in itty-bitty pieces, you'll handle it less which will prevent the butter from melting and it keeps the fat molecules intact, resulting in flakier pastries.\"\nSubmitted by Casey Austin, Facebook.\n11. Always let your cakes cool before attempting to ice them.\n\"They\u2019ll break if you take them out the tin too early and the frosting will melt right off. Basically, let those babies rest for a good 30 minutes before attempting anything\".\n12. Small things, like sifting your flour, make a big difference.\n\"I know it seems like such a superfluous, tiny step, but it really does create a world of difference in the quality of your final cake, pie, bread, or whatever other goodie you are making. I used to think that I was not that great with baking, but once I started taking little, easy, quality assurance steps, like sifting flour, or making sure things were baking at the right temperature, my baking really transformed into something.\"\n13.

The problem \u2014 and the opportunity \u2014 is much greater than that.\nWe may be at a rare moment when a cultural tsunami \u2014 a parade of women, no longer intimidated, reporting sexual assault, abuse and predation \u2014 matches a political movement \u2014 the rampant abuse of political, especially executive, power.\nIt\u2019s a truism that sexual assault or harassment is about power \u2014 men putting themselves over women with lesser power. Harvey Weinstein didn\u2019t abuse Meryl Streep; he reportedly abused the young and vulnerable and ambitious women who feared his influence as a career gatekeeper in Hollywood.\nRoy Moore, a young assistant district attorney, implicitly wielded the power of his office. A DA has the power to summon a teenager from her trig class to the office to take his call; that kind of display tells the teenage girl that he has the ability to complicate her life.\nAnd so it was with Donald Trump, who allegedly barged in on 15-year-old pageant contestants \u2014 because he could. Trump\u2019s complainants \u2014 an aspiring model, a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant, a receptionist in his building, even a young People magazine reporter \u2014 were no match for a billionaire whose chokehold on the New York tabloid scene was widely known. Who\u2019s going to believe their accounts of a forced kiss or a hand up the skirt when Trump has the gossip columnists in the palm of his hand, never mind a hit TV show?\nNo one should discount the upheaval, the rage that reverberates throughout society as women break the code of silence and puncture the aura of invincibility around powerful men. And beware the politician who commits or condones such conduct, or enables a predator.\nTrump and right-wingers such as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., refuse to say that Moore should not be elected. They are too intimidated by Stephen Bannon and too aware that if Moore is not fit, then neither is Trump. They use the voters\u2019 decision as an excuse (a selective one) in voicing their opinion. Really \u2014 did they ever stop heckling the Clintons? Did they ever withhold judgment on the press, political opponents or anyone else? Of course not. They hide behind voters\u2019 skirts and in doing so enable predators to try to sway voters.\nNow, the abuse of power is also central to Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP and his authoritarian outlook. His intolerance of dissent and maligning of democratic institutions that are the hallmark of his presidency are abuses of the limited power granted to him in our constitutional system. He\u2019ll pull a network\u2019s \u201clicense,\u201d maybe meddle in a merger concerning a media nemesis, delegitimize the press and use the instruments of power to make himself the sole repository of truth.

In defeating a bill to force states to justify racially biased patterns in death sentencing, the proposed Racial Justice Act (news article, May 25), the Senate has betrayed the constitutional rights of African-Americans to equal protection of the laws.\nThe purported ''protection'' afforded by capital punishment is extended almost exclusively to white people. Prosecutors who claim -falsely - that the death penalty is a deterrent simply don't use it to fight crimes in black communities. A recent survey of 200 homicides in Muscogee County, Georgia, showed that approximately 75 percent of the victims were African-Americans. Yet in the seven cases in which the prosecutor sought the death penalty, all the victims were white. Statistical evidence shows similar, stark, racist sentencing patterns in jurisdictions and states throughout the country.\nYet the Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that race discrimination in capital sentencing can't be proved by statistical documentation, no matter how compelling. Rather, each capital defendant must prove purposeful discrimination. But few prosecutors or judges will openly display the kind of overt racism that the Supreme Court seems to require to overturn a death sentence. The Racial Justice Act would have corrected the Court's decision, requiring states to demonstrate that racially biased capital sentencing patterns could be justified by legitimate, nonracial factors. Its defeat means that capital defendants have no available mechanism to challenge racism in sentencing.\nThe framers of the 14th Amendment to our Constitution were faced with precisely the same phenomenon we face: the perpetrators of crimes against black citizens were not punished as severely as the perpetrators of identical crimes against white citizens. The framers found this inequality intolerable and wrote into the Constitution a pledge that all citizens would be guaranteed ''equal protection of the laws.'' Those who voted against the Racial Justice Act are ignoring this history and repudiating this pledge.\nThe writers are with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund."}

In its third and latest asset purchase program, it has been buying $85 billion in U.S. Treasury and mortgage-related bonds each month to drive down borrowing costs and spur investment and hiring.\nBernanke set off a brief but fierce global market sell-off last month when he outlined plans to reduce this quantitative easing program, and he has joined a slew of officials since then who have spelled out their intention to keep rates near zero well after the bond buying ends.\nUnder the timeline Bernanke laid out on June 19, Fed policymakers would likely reduce their monthly bond buys later this year and halt them altogether by mid-2014, as long as the economic recovery unfolds as expected.\nIn his remarks on Wednesday, Bernanke said the pace of asset purchases could be reduced \"somewhat more quickly\" if economic conditions improved faster than expected. On the other hand, the current pace \"could be maintained for longer\" if the labor market outlook darkened, or inflation did not look like it was rising back toward the Fed&apos;s 2 percent goal.\n\"Indeed, if needed, the (Fed&apos;s policy-setting) committee would be prepared to employ all its tools, including an increase (in) the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability,\" Bernanke said.\nWhile the end of the Fed&apos;s bond buying may be in view, Bernanke repeated that officials will keep rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent, as long as inflation remains in check. Most do not expect rates to rise until sometime in 2015.\nHe also said that the Fed would look closely at any decline in unemployment to see whether it was being driven by strength in hiring or a decline in the number of Americans looking for work, in which case the central bank would be more patient before raising rates.\nAny rate hike cycle, he said, would be gradual.\nSome Fed officials have been concerned about the low level of inflation, with the"}

{"idx": "8474", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Among the many mysteries of human biology is why complex diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and psychiatric disorders are so difficult to predict and, often, to treat. An equally perplexing puzzle is why one individual gets a disease like cancer or depression, while an identical twin remains perfectly healthy.\nNow scientists have discovered a vital clue to unraveling these riddles. The human genome is packed with at least four million gene switches that reside in bits of DNA that once were dismissed as \u201cjunk\u201d but that turn out to play critical roles in controlling how cells, organs and other tissues behave. The discovery, considered a major medical and scientific breakthrough, has enormous implications for human health because many complex diseases appear to be caused by tiny changes in hundreds of gene switches.\nThe findings, which are the fruit of an immense federal project involving 440 scientists from 32 laboratories around the world, will have immediate applications for understanding how alterations in the non-gene parts of DNA contribute to human diseases, which may in turn lead to new drugs. They can also help explain how the environment can affect disease risk. In the case of identical twins, small changes in environmental exposure can slightly alter gene switches, with the result that one twin gets a disease and the other does not.\nAs scientists delved into the \u201cjunk\u201d \u2014 parts of the DNA that are not actual genes containing instructions for proteins \u2014 they discovered a complex system that controls genes. At least 80 percent of this DNA is active and needed. The result of the work is an annotated road map of much of this DNA, noting what it is doing and how. It includes the system of switches that, acting like dimmer switches for lights, control which genes are used in a cell and when they are used, and determine, for instance, whether a cell becomes a liver cell or a neuron.\nThe discoveries were published on Wednesday in six papers in the journal Nature and in 24 papers in Genome Research and Genome Biology. In addition, The Journal of Biological Chemistry is publishing six review articles, and Science is publishing yet another article.\nHuman DNA is \u201ca lot more active than we expected, and there are a lot more things happening than we expected,\u201d said Ewan Birney of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute, a lead researcher on the project.\nIn one of the Nature papers, researchers link the gene switches to a range of human diseases \u2014 multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, celiac disease \u2014 and even to traits like height. In large studies over the past decade, scientists found that minor changes in human DNA sequences increase the risk that a person will get those diseases. But those changes were in the junk, now often referred to as the dark matter \u2014 they were not changes in genes \u2014 and their significance was not clear. The new analysis reveals that a great many of those changes alter gene switches and are highly significant.\n\u201cMost of the changes that affect disease don\u2019t lie in the genes themselves; they lie in the switches,\u201d said Michael Snyder, a Stanford University researcher for the project, called Encode, for Encyclopedia of DNA Elements.\nThe discoveries also can reveal which genetic changes are important in cancer, and why. As they began determining the DNA sequences of cancer cells, researchers realized that most of the thousands of DNA changes in cancer cells were not in genes; they were in the dark matter. The challenge is to figure out which of those changes are driving the cancer\u2019s growth.\nIn prostate cancer, for example, his group found mutations in important genes that"}

First-base umpire Sean Barber called Yelich safe, but Gonzalez challenged the call after getting the signal relayed from video-replay coordinator Horacio Ramirez, who thought first baseman Freddie Freeman tagged Yelich\u2019s hand before he reached the base.\nAfter the play was reviewed on replay, the call was overturned and Yelich was called out. It was the 14th pickoff for Teheran since the beginning of the 2013 season, more than twice as many as any other right-handed pitcher had in that span before Sunday.\nFor Gonzalez, it was the 22nd successful challenge in 31 attempts this season in the first year of expanded video replay. In the ninth inning Saturday, he challenged a call at first base when Jordany Valdespin was called safe with two out on a ground ball to Freeman, who tossed to pitcher David Carpenter covering the base.\nCarpenter had to reach back to catch the ball and make the tag while twisting on the run. But replays showed he tagged Valdespin and the called was overturned, ending the inning with the score 3-3.\nThe Braves won on Evan Gattis\u2019 10th-inning homer that was originally a triple off the center-field wall, yet another play that was overturned by the umpires.

The small, simple clay cylinder is covered in cuneiform writing. Many experts believe the writing is the world\u2019s first declaration of human rights. The cylinder is now on display for the first time in Washington, DC. Jim Tedder has more on this highly valued piece of history.\nThe object called the Cyrus Cylinder is about 2,600 years old. The cylinder was found at the bottom of a religious center in what was the ancient city-state of Babylon. The writings on it are orders declared by King Cyrus the Great of Persia.\nNeil McGregor is the director of the British Museum in London.\nKing Cyrus captured Babylon more than 25 centuries ago. He controlled the largest empire, or state, in history. John Curtis organized the Cyrus Cylinder exhibit in Washington. He says the clay object provides a look into the moral leadership of King Cyrus.\nThe cylinder is described in Christianity\u2019s holy book, the Bible. King Cyrus also permitted the newly captured people to practice, or exercise, whatever religion they wished. And he permitted displaced Jews to return to their homeland.\nNeil McGregor says it is interesting to consider these actions in connection with the current tensions between Israel and Iran.\nThomas Jefferson is said to have owned two copies of a biography of Cyrus by the ancient Greek historian Xenophon. Many historians believe the book influenced Jefferson as he wrote the American Declaration of Independence.\nThe Cyrus Cylinder is a permanent part of the British Museum in London. This is the first time it has been shown in America. It can be seen at the Smithsonian's Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington. After it leaves the galleries, the cylinder and other ancient objects will travel to four other American cities.

Here\u2019s the answer.\nWashington, D.C. is the capital of the United States. The city is also known simply as Washington. It was named for the country\u2019s first president, George Washington.\nThat story goes back to the beginning of the United States more than two hundred years ago. The states approved a constitution in seventeen eighty-eight. But they could not decide where to build the permanent capital. Northern states did not want the capital in the South because slavery existed there. The southern states did not want the capital in the North.\n\u200bFinally, after much negotiation, the United States Congress agreed to build the capital along the Potomac River between the states of Virginia and Maryland. The city would be built in a federal area on land provided by the two states. The city would be called Washington. The larger federal area would be named the District of Columbia.\nColumbia was another name for the United States, used mostly by poets and other writers. The name came from Christopher Columbus, the explorer. So the city became known as Washington, the District of Columbia or Washington, D.C.\nMany other places in the United States are named after President George"}

As technology becomes a bigger part of daily life and more investors manage their money digitally, financial firms have pushed to provide online investing solutions, which has led to a proliferation of robo-driven services.\nPart of the competitive allure for Wall Street firms is to appeal to Millennials, now the nation's largest generation. Nearly six in 10 Millennials said they were interested in robo-advisers, a BlackRock survey found. The business of offering tech-savvy people the ability to build financial plans and fund portfolios has become highly competitive. Firms ranging from mutual fund giant Fidelity and low-cost brokerages like Charles Schwab to upstart digital companies like Wealthfront and Betterment now provide individual investors with low-cost, easy-to-use robo-advisers.\n\"The robo-adviser has officially gone mainstream,\" NerdWallet analyst Arielle O'Shea noted.\nLike the other services, TIAA's Personal Portfolio allows a user to go online and answer a few questions about their age, investment goals, time horizon and their feelings about risk. It then recommends a computer-generated portfolio.\nSome robo services build investment portfolios using only \"passive\" funds, such as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500. Others use \"active\" funds run by portfolio managers whose goal is to post bigger returns than the market. Some offer a mix of passive and active strategies. Niche offerings like OpenInvest and GrowInvest focus solely on \"impact\" investing, or buying funds investing in companies with good grades when it comes to the environment, social causes and corporate governance.\nTIAA said its new robo service will allow investors to gain exposure to all three of those types of investments.\nKathie Andrade, CEO of TIAA's Retail Financial Services business, described the firm's offering as a \"digital coach for your wallet\" but with the human touch available if you prefer the support of a financial adviser.\nThe new service, she said, was created with the younger generation in mind.

The Departments of Commerce, Labor, Transportation, and Treasury have agreed to conduct \"open data roundtables\" with some of the biggest users of their agencies' data, through a program developed by the Governance Lab (GovLab) at New York University.\nThe announcement, made during a Center for Data Innovation forum in Washington April 8, prompted Agriculture Department Deputy CIO Joyce Hunter, who was in the audience, to stand up and pledge that the USDA would also participate in the program.\nThe roundtables reflect a shift in approach to how federal agencies view the data they generate -- and the communities of users interested in turning that information into products and services for the public.\nThe open data roundtables will bring together executives from federal agencies and from private sector data users in GovLab's Open Data 500 project, said Joel Gurin, senior advisor at the GovLab and director of the Open Data 500 project. The project bills itself as the \"the first comprehensive study of US companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services.\"\nAs part of the announcement, GovLab also unveiled a new version of its Open Data 500 website Tuesday, which lists all 500 firms and shows how companies in 16 industries are taking advantage of openly available government data.\nThe Obama administration in May 2013 issued a new Open Data Policy and Executive Order, making open data the default state for agencies. The policy directed agencies to treat the information they generate as a national asset and make it available for the public to consume in machine-readable formats. The White House and federal agencies have also staged a series of \"Datapalooza\" events, showcasing how private sector firms, such as iTriage, OPower, and BillGuard, are capitalizing on government data.\nBut the dialogue has generally been one-sided, according to Gurin, who led the Federal Communications Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau from 2009-2012 and chaired the White House Task Force on Smart Disclosure.\n\"Agencies would say, 'We have a dataset; see if you can do something with it,' and companies would come back with potential applications,\" he told InformationWeek. But agencies rarely engaged directly with data users and developers to understand the broader needs in the market and how agency data could be put to greater use.\nGurin calls the Open Data Policy and its presumption of openness by default \"a revolutionary idea.\" But the policy also creates headaches for agencies, which must now inventory their enterprise datasets and eventually make permissible datasets available to the public, subject to privacy and security requirements.\n\"It's a massive task,\" said Gurin.

It's available only for Linux, a free Unix-based operating system and is still in the early stages of development.\nThe makers of Mnemonic want the browser to be modular--in other words, broken up into pieces so the system uses only what is absolutely necessary for the task at hand. That approach results in a core application of about 100K, according to the project leaders.\nThe browser-only Navigator 4.04 is about 8MB, and the smallest version of Internet Explorer 4.01 is about 13MB. Much smaller is another alternate browser, Opera, which has made a name for itself among Net users with its speed and small size--about 1 MB.\nMnemonic's modular design also allows developers to take its pieces and put them into other types of applications, such as a word processor or presentation graphics.\nSuch component-based development is catching on elsewhere. For example, Microsoft has spread the use of its IE browser by making the underlying HTML engine available to third parties to put into applications.\nWhen users of America Online or Intuit's Quicken financial software jump to the Web, they use Internet Explorer technology. Microsoft may share the components of IE, but it does not make the source code available, arguing that developers prefer a prebuilt component to plug into their applications.\nThe idea behind the Mnemonic project, as well as Netscape's decision to make the source code for Communicator free, takes the sharing several steps further. By publishing source code--the raw recipe at the heart of the browser--the organizations hope to involve the at-large Net community in the development process.\nThe general principle is that anyone can use the source code, or underlying recipe, of the browser with the agreement that any modifications to it will in turn be released to the public for reuse. Netscape will release its code March 31 and has already set up a Web site for developers to download code, share information, and get advice.\nNeither Netscape nor Mnemonic have decided whether developers that make commercial products with the source code will be required to submit their code back to the development community. Such a requirement makes the source-code scheme less attractive to commercial developers, who often see their augmentations of code as a competitive advantage.\nSome free source code projects, such as the Apache Web server, allow developers to keep their extensions as their own."}

The grapes hang too long on vines growing in soils that are too dense. In the cellar, they are treated with too much new oak. The aim seems to be power without restraint, size without structure, depth without tone. The effect is as if syrah had dressed up for Halloween as grenache, or shiraz.

The same drinks were consumed by each group one hour after exercising.\nThe training consisted of three types of exercise: pushing (e.g. bench press, chest fly), pulling (e.g. seated lateral pull down, abdominal exercises without weights), and leg exercises (e.g. leg press, seated two-leg hamstring curl). Training was monitored daily one on one by personal trainers to ensure proper technique.\n\u201cThe women who drank milk gained barely any weight because what they gained in lean muscle they balanced out with a loss in fat\u201d said Phillips. \u201cOur data show that simple things like regular weightlifting exercise and milk consumption work to substantially improve women\u2019s body composition and health.\u201d Phillips\u2019 lab is now following this study up with a large clinical weight loss trial in women.\nFunding for the study was provided by McMaster University, CIHR, and the Dairy Farmers of Canada.\nMcMaster University, one of four Canadian universities listed among the Top 100 universities in the world, is renowned for its innovation in both learning and discovery.

{"idx": "8499", "prompt": "Continue the following text: It&apos;s common to hear the term \"Kush\" in a conversation about weed. In its base form, Kush is a pure indica strain, but OG Kush is much more of a hybrid than pure-breed. OG Kush marijuana seeds are capable of producing high-quality gardens with high-quality bud. They also have plenty of uses in the medicinal world.\nWhen we think of Kush, it&apos;s common to think of a harsh smoke that really deadens the senses. This is because Kush is a pure indica strain. OG Kush, on the other hand, produces the exact opposite effect. It is able to provide you with an immediate boost of energy that makes it perfect for social engagements. It&apos;s certainly not ideal if you are trying to get to sleep. The reason for all this is because of the increased incidence of THC on the plant. Although it is an indica-dominant hybrid, the amount of THC negates a lot of the heavy effects you&apos;d associate with traditional Kush varieties. The distinct citrusy, sour tastes and aromas work delightfully in concert with your improved mood and energy level. Download my free marijuana grow bible for more tips about growing marijuana.\nPerhaps the single most important factor of the OG Kush plant is its ability to produce large amounts of dense buds. These buds are considerably easy to harvest, which is good for novice growers who don&apos;t know much about harvesting. The plants themselves attain average heights of around 40 to 60 inches, although they are generally on the lower end of that spectrum.\nOG Kush marijuana seeds will produce plants that take about 9 weeks to flower. The plants will exude a distinct piney aroma that will have your grow room smelling like a forest. The yields are relatively low at around 16 ounces per 10 square feet, but the 21% THC content more than makes up for it. With the OG Kush strain, you can also get seeds that are feminized and/or autoflowering to make the growing process easier for you.\nAs noted previously, the OG Kush strain has a lot of indications for medicinal use. It can help with everything from depression to appetite loss. Patients on chemotherapy have used OG Kush to lessen nausea associated with the procedures. Anorexia can also be mitigated with the use of OG Kush. Glaucoma patients have seen relief with the use of OG Kush. The strain can also be used as a general pain reliever.\nIf you want to start growing OG Kush, download my free grow guide and order some marijuana seeds. All top quality marijuana seeds are available in my marijuana seed shop. We ship seeds to the US, CA and many other countries.

Companies such as Mirantis and Red Hat have also worked hard on making it simple to install the popular open-source cloud.\nWhile Autopilot runs side by side with Ubuntu 15.10, it deploys, manages and scales Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu OpenStack Kilo. It has been designed to fully support in-place upgrades between releases.\nContinuing my series on Linux installers, here is a screen-shot walk through the latest Ubuntu release.\n\"One of the biggest issues organisations using OpenStack face is how to scale their clouds in line with expansion without having to employ expensive cloud architects to manually re-design them. Autopilot offers enterprises a smart, way to scale their cloud technically and financially,\" said Shawn Madden, Autopilot Product Manager at Canonical in a statement. \"We have built Autopilot to deliver superior scale and economics in a simple to use package.\"\nIf your company does have OpenStack expertise, then you might want to try Ubuntu 15.04's built-in OpenStack: the brand-new OpenStack distribution Liberty.\nFirst release of Magnum with container framework support for integration of Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos.\nOpenStack Liberty is also available for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.\nOn the server side, LXD, Ubuntu's machine container hypervisor, is now included in Ubuntu by default. With it, Ubuntu servers can easily host hundreds of other Linux guest containers.\nAccording to Canonical, \"LXD provides all of the key features expected of a modern hypervisor -- image management, snapshots, live migration, Fan overlay networking, IPv4 and IPv6 support, and an industry leading security profile.\" In addition to these features, LXD also provides an open, RESTful API. This can be used to create tools that can start, stop, clone, and live migrate LXD containers. The RESTful API is still beta. The first example, a OpenStack nova-compute-lxd driver, is now available as a Tech Preview in Ubuntu OpenStack Liberty.\nThis release also includes an improved version of the Ubuntu's Metal as a Service (MaaS) platform. This can be used to install Linux or Windows operating system onto physical hardware. In 15.10, MaaS's web interface has been redesigned, and can be used on both PCs and mobile devices..\nThe Wiley Werewolf server is built on the v4.2 Linux kernel. This kernel brings Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for ARM processors, Linux Security Module (LCM) Stacking, and the new thermal Power Allocator governor to Ubuntu.\nOn top of this Canonical has added fan networking for container network"}

It occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen even though blood is still flowing. When oxygen supply is totally cut off, it is called brain anoxia.\nBrain hypoxia is a medical emergency because the brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly.\nThere are several causes of brain hypoxia. They include drowning, suffocating, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Mild symptoms include memory loss and problems with motor function, such as movement. Severe cases can result in seizures and brain death.\nRead on to learn more about brain hypoxia, also known as cerebral hypoxia.\nBrain hypoxia is a medical emergency and severe symptoms can include seizure and coma.\nThe symptoms of a lack of oxygen to the brain, or brain hypoxia, may be mild or severe and depend on the level and duration of oxygen deprivation.\nBrain cells can begin to die after just 5 minutes of oxygen loss. Symptoms become more dangerous the longer oxygen flow to the brain is cut off.\nIn cases of brain death, there is no brain activity. The pupils of the eyes do not respond to light and people cannot breathe without assistance from a life-support machine. However, the heart continues to pump blood around the body.\nThere are many reasons why someone may experience brain hypoxia.\nBrain hypoxia can affect anyone who experiences a shortage or lack of oxygen to the brain, but some people are at higher risk than others.\nCertain sports, including boxing, can be a risk factor for brain hypoxia.\nSports enthusiasts may be at higher risk if they engage in activities that have a higher risk than others of resulting in a head injury or trauma to the windpipe.\nThose who must hold their breath for long periods or travel to high altitudes are also at increased risk.\nPeople experiencing exposure to intense smoke or carbon monoxide through their job, such as firefighters, may be at increased risk of brain hypoxia.\nAnoxia is when a person's brain or body is not receiving enough oxygen. Learn more about anoxia here.\nA doctor will usually diagnose brain hypoxia based on a person's medical history, a physical examination, and other tests.\nDuring the medical history and physical examination, the doctor will ask about someone's current symptoms and recent activities.\nBrain hypoxia is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. It is vital that normal oxygen supply to the brain resumes quickly to prevent complications or brain death.\nTreatment will vary, depending on the cause and severity of the hypoxia. Basic life support systems are often necessary. People with severe hypoxia may need a machine known as a ventilator to breathe for them.\nIn some cases, a doctor may cool the person down to slow their brain activity and reduce its need for oxygen. However, it is unclear how beneficial this treatment is.\nThe duration of a coma and other factors can influence the outcome of brain hypoxia.\nHow long a person has experienced oxygen deprivation will determine their outlook and recovery from brain hypoxia.\nIt is difficult to predict how quickly a person will recover, but some factors can help foresee the outcome.\nHaving low brain oxygen levels for several hours can suggest a poorer recovery. Also, research suggests that a person's functional status on admission to hospital strongly indicates their recovery prospects.\nLength of coma. The longer a person remains in a coma, the poorer the outcome. They may have a reduced risk of damage if the coma lasts"}

I\u2019m very moved by all of us being in the room together because we\u2019re of many generations and we\u2019re all pulling together and this story is about pulling together generationally. It\u2019s moving and real to me, and I\u2019m really enjoying the process and being with everybody.\"\nHere's a closer look at some of the offerings, and scroll down for a snapshot of everything else coming our way this fall.\nMoore says a lot has changed since the Chicago run of \"The Cher Show\" this summer, but what hasn't is its heart and commitment to telling Cher's story \u2014 warts and all, and with plenty of input from the legend herself, who serves as a producer. And of course, plenty of \"explosive, interplanetary stuff,\" Bob Mackie costumes and THOSE songs.\n\"It\u2019s been great.

{"idx": "8521", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Opinions vary about Jazz Caf\u00e9, in the eastern San Jos\u00e9 suburb of San Pedro. For some, it is an authentic live-music venue and student hangout; others call it an overpriced bar with ideas above its station. However, there is no doubt that since its opening in 1999 the venue has proved to be one of the city\u2019s liveliest, filling up almost every night with a diverse crowd.\nUnderstandably, therefore, the opening of a second location on the upscale west side of town is big news. Jazz Caf\u00e9 Escaz\u00fa opened its doors for an invitation-only preliminary inauguration Feb. 6, and The Tico Times was there to see what all the fuss was about.\nSome might say the purpose-built structure is more reminiscent of a jack-in-thebox than a tribute to old coffee money, but there\u2019s no denying that the place has a charm all its own.\nInside, the decor is stylish without being ostentatious, with a smooth concrete floor, dark wood paneling on the walls and a rough, red brick bar. The wrought-iron seats with crimson suede cushions ooze sophistication. The layout and design are equally impressive. Unlike in San Pedro, every table in the house has a view of the stage, really putting the focus on the music. The busts of late Costa Rican bolerista Ray Tico and seven other renowned jazz musicians, sculpted by Andrea Brenes, look down approvingly from their niches on the back wall.\nOf course, this being the grand opening, it was hard to get a genuine sense of the place. This was a night to be seen, to shake hands, to blow kisses away from cheeks. The chill, blue mood lighting lost some effect in the glare of television cameras and the flash of press photography.\nOrganizers\u2019 efforts to ensure a spectacular opening included an impressive array of circus artists performing for guests. Outside, a squad of jugglers, unicyclists and stilt walkers looked like Alex\u2019s droogs in \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d while inside, troops of interpretive dancers in skin-tight, monotone bodysuits entertained freakishly. The air dancers of Danza A\u00e9rea were spectacular, performing complex routines while suspended from drapes hanging from the roof.\nAs for the music, the honor of playing the first set at the new venue fell to leading Costa Rican group Malpa\u00eds \u2013 not surprising, considering that band member Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez is one of the three partners in Jazz Caf\u00e9. The band showed off its abilities in an impressive show, with Gilberto Jarqu\u00edn\u2019s drum solo being the highlight of some outstanding performances. DJ Bernal Monestel and Tico rock group Las Tortugas also performed.\nThough there are bound to be differences between this location and the original in San Pedro \u2013 the fancy cars in the venue\u2019s parking facilities, for example \u2013 Fern\u00e1ndez insisted that, as far as possible, they would be sticking to their trusted formula, running a similar schedule with performances every night.\nJazz Caf\u00e9 Escaz\u00fa was expected to open to the public this week pending permits, according to Fern\u00e1ndez. A phone number for the new venue was not available by press time, but inquiries can be made by calling the San Pedro location at 253-8933."}

Critics say it misses a chance to showcase the city's ethnic diversity.\nThe $30 million Warner Bros. film has grossed more than $35 million since its Aug. 15 world debut in Los Angeles and came out tops with its release in U.S. theatres over the weekend.\nThat surpassed expectations, said Fiona Xie, who plays the starlet Kitty Pong as one of 12 Singapore-based members of its cast. It's \"liberating to just be part of a powerful positive movement,\" she told The Associated Press.\n\"As an Asian actor, I think it's great, and a step in the right direction,\" Nat Ho, who plays a small role in the film, told The AP.\nThe film has drawn criticism for its inaccurate portrayal of Singapore's ethnic diversity, with some calling it a misrepresentation of the country's minority races. Even though a majority of its residents are Chinese, a quarter of its population are Malay, Indian, or Eurasians, with many migrant workers from surrounding countries like Bangladesh or the Philippines.\n\"There's this whole notion of the movie being a triumph for representation, which is very problematic. The only Indians and Malays you see are servants,\" said Nicholas Yong, a Singaporean journalist and author who saw the movie before its Singapore premiere.\nEven though its glamorous depiction of Singapore could give its tourism a boost, it was not entirely welcomed.\n\"To us, 'Crazy Rich' should not just be about the opulence and luxury showcased in the film, but Singapore's actual richness in terms of our diversity,\" said Singapore Tourism Board's spokesperson Lynette Pang.\nWhile the country has enjoyed economic progress, the wealth gap in the city is widening, and the super rich with their extravagant lifestyle are a tiny, privileged minority.\nWriting in the South China Morning Post of Hong Kong, which has more than its share of tycoons and elite wealthy families, commentator Alex Lo said he enjoyed the film with \"guilty pleasure.\"\n\"But amusement aside, it strikes me the whole purpose of the film exercise is to glamorize and legitimize the super-rich in Asia, many of whom are ethnic Chinese in real life,\" he said.\n\"Should we, as the audience and hoi polloi, be tantalized and awed by the display of mega wealth, which has been described, by most accounts, as accurate.

{"idx": "8533", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Nintendo Switch owners have been given an opportunity to take part in one of the best games currently available this generation. Warframe has a massive following and is one of the few games that has been evolving like no other game on the market, and Switch owners even have the option to port over their data from PC... but with limitations.\nPolygon is reporting that there is an option to migrate your PC account over to the Nintendo Switch. Whether you started out slow and worked your way up, but never quite finished anything on PC, or you're a high-level space ninja with all the latest and greatest equipment, there's an option to migrate some of that progress over to Nintendo's little hybrid console. However, the migration process is a one-time thing, and you can only move your content from PC to Switch, not the other way around.\nThis means that if you have a Warframe account and you move over all your content right now, but then decide to make more progress on the PC side and then transfer over some rare stuff, you won't be able to. There's a limit of only being able to move your data over once, and whatever progress you make on the Switch side can't move back to your PC account. So whatever progress you make on the Switch will stay exclusive to your account on the Switch.\nBut why is the data transfer process just a one-time deal and why can't Switch owners move data back to PC? What's the big deal?\nThus, the PC and console build versions are out of sync by about a month or so. Any migration attempt would require putting the account through a kind of update/de-update converter to amend and sync. This can lead to a lot of issues including potential loss of in-game items due to being from a later patch, data corruption, loss of player data, the inability to play until previous builds are reached, etc. In short, lots of headaches.\nSo what if you already started an account on Warframe, but then you remembered that you had an account on PC and want to move it over? Well, you can. However, keep in mind that any account migration will permanently overwrite any existing data on your Switch account through the Nintendo Network. So any platinum you've purchased from the cash shop, any items you've acquired, or any Warframes or weapons you've crafted on the Switch version will be overwritten if you decide to port over your PC account.\nNow what about items you may have acquired from the latest update on PC that aren't available on Switch? Well, according to the list, those items will be withheld on your account until the Switch version is updated to include those items as well. Also, your friends list will not carryover.\nWarframe will not and does not support cross-platform compatibility due to the syncing issues, which is caused by the slower console certification process. On the upside, your PC account will not be affected at all in the migration process."}

To settle the dilemma, President Benjamin Harrison stepped in and settled the matter with his approval of the Cape Meares site.\nThe Cape Meares Lighthouse was constructed in 1890, just south of Tillamook Bay. The stubby, octagonal tower is only 38 feet tall, but sits on the edge of a towering 200 ft. cliff above the ocean.\nOn January 1st, 1890, Cape Meares was lit by Anthony Miller (the first principal keeper) and his two assistants.\nAt the time, the lighthouse consisted of a fire-wick kerosene lamp and an eight-paneled lens that had both red and clear panels to create a red flash every minute.\nThe light was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 1963, replaced by a powerful beacon mounted on a bleak concrete blockhouse.\nThe lighthouse structures were immediately subject to severe vandalism.\nThe keeper's quarters had to be destroyed, and the four bullseyes from the First Order lens were stolen.\nCape Meares Light was eventually turned over to the Oregon State Park system.\nOver the years three of the four bullseyes have been recovered -- one in a drug raid in 1984, one returned to a local museum, and one anonymously left on the assistant park manager's front porch.\nA must-see when driving the Three Capes Scenic route, Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint is situated on a headland 200 feet above the ocean.\nCape Lookout and Cape Kiwanda are the other two capes on this route, they are both south of Cape Meares.\nCape Meares provides an excellent view of the largest colony of nesting common murres (the site is one of the most populous colonies of nesting sea birds on the continent).\nBald eagles and a peregrine falcon have also been known to nest near here.\nTradition handed down by the Indians is that the eerie giant is a burial tree shaped when it was young to hold canoes of a chief's family.\nSuch deeply-rooted lore passed from generation to generation is likely to be founded on truth, and much of it is corroborated by historical research.\nArchaeologists have found evidence that Indians lived along these shores for 3,000 years.\nIn looking back through this dimly lit past, we have learned that the tribes here placed their dead in the trees in canoes.\nThe tribes in this area for generations back through the dim past placed their dead in the trees in canoes.\nBut the trees had to be prepared to hold them.\nBranches of a forest tree normally reach straight upward, toward the light, but those on a burial tree were forced, when"}

The combination of colors, the subtle camera movements and focuses, and the talented actresses make this a bit of eye candy that anyone with eyes can appreciate.\nThe plot moves along nicely and it's acted decently, but one begins to wonder just how necessary the narration is? If, indeed, the film could not survive without it, why couldn't it have been done with more conviction and less fluff? Even when the sporadic narration proves useful for the furthering and understanding of the plot, it's bogged down in flowery metaphors or overly direct instructions on what we are suppose to feel at this point in the film.\nThere seems to be no middle ground. Taking a step back from my film critic mind, I began to look at this film politically. The female lead is strong, has set goals, and an intense passion for life. At a young age she risks life and limb to find her sister and, at a later part in her life, works herself thin to achieve her goals. However, it is one particular goal that enrages my feminist mind.\nShe is in love and seems to forget about everything else in her life in order the man of her desires. She even practically destroys the lives of several people, but is rewarded in the end with a hug and a kiss. Sayuri is a likeable character and this disappointed is hardly the film makers fault, but I still cannot let this issue go without mention."}

{"idx": "8557", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Analysis: SSD performance -- is a slowdown inevitable?\nThe recent revelation that Intel Corp.'s consumer-class solid-state disk (SSD) drives suffer from fragmentation that can cause a significant performance degradation raises the question: Do all SSDs slow down with use over time?\nThe answer is yes -- and every drive manufacturer knows it.\nHere's the rub: Drive performance and longevity are inherently connected, meaning drive manufacturers work to come up with the best balance between blazing speed and endurance. And since SSDs are fairly new to the market, users are finding that while they do offer better speed in some ways than hard disk drives, questions remain about how much of that speed they deliver for the long haul.\nOne thing you can be sure of is that the shiny new SSD you just bought isn't likely to continue performing at the same level it did when you first pulled it out of the box. That's important to know, given the speed with which SSDs have proliferated in the marketplace amid claims that they're faster, use less power and can be more reliable -- especially in laptops -- since there are no moving parts.\nThey also remain more expensive than their spinning-disk hard drive counterparts.\n\"An empty [SSD] drive will perform better than one written to. We all know that,\" said Alvin Cox, co-chairman of the Joint Electronic Device Engineering Council's (JEDEC) JC-64.8 subcommittee for SSDs, which expects to publish standards this year for measuring drive endurance. Cox, a senior staff engineer at Seagate, said a quality SSD should last between five and 10 years.\nThe good news is that after an initial dip in performance, SSDs tend to level off, according to Eden Kim, chairman of the Solid State Storage Initative's Consumer SSD Market Development Task Force. Even if they do drop in performance over time -- undercutting a manufacturer's claims -- consumer flash drives are still vastly faster than traditional hard drives, because they can perform two to five times the input/ouput operations (I/Os) per second of a hard drive, he said.\nIn May 2008, the JEDEC subcommittee co-chaired by Seagate and Micron, held its first meeting to address the standards development needs of the still-emerging SSD market.\nJEDEC is among several groups working to publish either standards or specifications for the drives by year's end. Along with IDEMA (International Disk Drive Equipment and Materials Association) and the SSD Alliance, headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, the Storage Networking Industry Association's (SNIA) Solid State Storage Initiative plans to publish performance specifications no later than the third quarter for vendors to adopt and eventually use on their SSD packaging.\nSNIA's specifications will set up standard benchmarks for measuring new drive performance and degradation over time, depending on the applications being used.\nPhil Mills, chairman of the Solid State Storage Initiative, said the performance numbers most manufacturers use now for marketing represent a drive's \"burst rate\" -- not its steady state or average read rate. \"So there's already a huge difference between out-of-the-box versus constant use,\" he said. \"And then, in both burst mode and steady state, there are huge differences in performance between manufacturers.\"\nBecause SSDs have no moving parts, when the drives go bad -- and they do on occasion -- what users are apt to see are failures at the controller or chip level where firmware bugs can affect"}

He was the heir to the Steward of Gondor in The Lord of the Rings, he played the hand of the King in Game of Thrones and now, finally, he\u2019s getting his own kingdom. He\u2019s about to be cast as Snow White\u2019s father, the King, in Tarsem Singh\u2018s Snow White. That\u2019s the Relativity, Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer, family friendly one. Not the Universal, Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, action one. Read more after the jump.\nVariety broke the news of the casting, which comes pretty late in the game as the film is currently shooting in Montreal aimed at a March 16, 2012 release date.\nIn this version of Snow White, which will stay truer to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Bean will play the supporting role of Snow White\u2019s father, the King, who loses his wife when Snow White is born and then remarries the woman (Julia Roberts) who will eventually grow to resent and shun Snow White, setting the story off in motion. Then it\u2019s the seven dwarfs, mirror on the wall, poison apple, you know the rest.\nBean is a fine addition to an already solid cast but the big worry with this version of Snow White is the rush that Relativity has put on it in order for the film to be the first in the marketplace.

It is all too easy in an increasingly urban world to live without actually touching or feeling the natural world. And if we don\u2019t, and we become increasingly detached from nature, there is a danger we start to care less. A slow disconnect is almost imperceptible, and all the more dangerous for that.\nThis is why the theme for this year\u2019s World Environment Day \u2013 connecting people to nature \u2013 is so important. Next time you head off to Sihanoukville, stop off at Preynub forest. Buy some fresh crab from the local community, hire a boat for an hour and go around one of the world\u2019s best preserved mangrove forests.\nOr if you\u2019re up in Siem Reap, take a trip up to Kulen Mountain National Park. Walk through one of the archaeological protected areas and feel that sense of wonder as a forest track opens up to reveal a beautiful temple, older than the ones at Angkor Wat. There are no crowds of tourists around these temples. Even better, consider a home stay in the village, and after a walk through the forest, relax and enjoy some superb home cooked food.\nAmazing through these experiences are, there is a darker side. If you get off the boat in Preynub mangrove forest and walk in a little you might hit a flotilla of garbage that is sometimes washed into the mangroves. When exploring Kulen National Park, you may come across an illegal solid-waste dump. Also you may notice that though the forest is beautiful it is devoid of any large trees. These were illegally cut years ago. These sometimes jarring reminders make us aware how great the threat is to what remains of our natural world.\nThe connection to nature and to communities whose livelihoods depend on these natural resources, has given rise to some beautiful ideas. Elinor \u201cLin\u201d Ostrom won a Nobel Prize in Economics without once taking an economics class, and if that wasn\u2019t impressive enough she also gave us a set of models and ideas on how we can better preserve natural resources and let local communities take control. Before Ostrom, conventional economics gave us the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d, that states that each member of a local community will seek to maximise her return and so collectively the community destroys the resources upon which it depends. We see this in over fishing, destruction of wildlife and forests. The only solution is strong top down rule of law.\nOstrom didn\u2019t just sit in an economic department, she spent time living and learning in communities who depended on natural resources to survive. What she found was that communities often live in blissful ignorance of the law of economics and successfully manage their resources. One such community, the lobster fishermen of the US state of Maine, had evolved a complex system of sharing lobster grounds to ensure everyone got a fair share, but that collectively they did not overfish and kept a plentiful supply of mature lobsters. One of her students did the same on the island of Bali, showing that a 1,000-year-old Hindu system of water management, produced a far better rice crop than the modern system that had been introduced by authorities.\nThe government relented and Bali returned to its ancient Hindu water management system \u2013 and a much bigger rice harvest.\nIn Preynub forest, the communities there can show"}

Scientific studies including the Eurobodalla Shire Council Coastal Lakes Enquiry, the Healthy Rivers Commission by the NSW Government, and PhD research by Daniel Spooner indicate restrictions on Forestry won\u2019t protect the fragile ecosystems in Corunna and Tilba lakes. A quote from Daniel Spooner: \u201cCoastal lakes are considered one of the most highly productive systems on earth, and both Corunna and Nangudga Lake have relatively high TN and TP concentrations that are commonly associated with relatively high phytoplankton biomasses. During summer 2002,Tilba Lake (10 km from Corunna Lake) experienced fish kills that were attributed to a three-month long algal bloom that consisted of blue green algae (Anabena sp.) and unidentified green algae. More recently, (autumn 2003) various agencies have revealed the algal species Prorocentrum cordatum (potentially toxic to shellfish and the species has been linked to human symptoms such as gastrointestinal disorders, headache, feebleness and dizziness) and Hetenosigma akashiwo (potentially toxic to fish causing gills clogging and damage) were present in Wallaga Lake.\u201d The reasons not to log Corunna Forest outweigh the reasons to log. Can we afford to allow this habitat to be logged when we are experiencing climate change and losing our bio-diversity at a rate greater than most countries? Water, water everywhere \u2026 somewhere \u2026 anywhere? You'd have to agree with John Ramsay's conclusions that fishing does have a lot to do with forestry and vice versa. Indeed our lives and health depend on water - without water, we simply will not survive. Let's be sure that among its many other important matters, our council is doing its utmost to ensure the long-term security of our shire's water supply and, importantly, that residents are kept aware of what's happening.

Starring Steve Carell (\u201cFoxcatcher\u201d) and Timothee Chalamet (\u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man\u2019s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father\u2019s efforts to save him.

After a CMPD officer killed Jonathan Ferrell in September 2013 in northeast Mecklenburg, Murray asked the N.C. Attorney General\u2019s Office to take over.\nAt the time, he said he wanted to avoid \u201ceven the appearance of impropriety\u201d since the case promised to draw intense public scrutiny.\nThe issue reflects concerns raised after high-profile police shootings in Ferguson, Mo., North Charleston and elsewhere. The deaths set off national debate about whether district attorneys can remain impartial enough to hold officers accountable.\nA White House task force, formed in response to the deaths, recommended local authorities consider special independent prosecutors to handle cases where police injure or kill civilians.\nNorth Carolina law gives local district attorneys broad discretion to decide when they should recuse themselves. Experts said rules allow them to issue decisions involving their former law firms as long as they have had no previous direct contact with the case while working in private practice.\nIn interviews, Murray and two partners from his former law office said they did not violate any ethical rules. The law partners said they have not had contact with Murray about any cases. Like other attorneys, the firm deals with assistant district attorneys and their supervisors, they said.\nMurray said his relationship with his old firm does not pose an actual conflict of interest. He said the Fonville case was treated differently than the Ferrell shooting because there were different circumstances.\nMurray said he no longer plans to recuse himself from cases involving the law office because it has been more than four years since he worked there.\nMurray said he believes his re-election last year should eliminate the appearance of a conflict of interest. He said the victory shows voters trust his judgment and impartiality.\nWhen Murray was recruited to become a partner at Goodman Carr, he was very clear about his ultimate career goal: He was going to one day run for district attorney.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a passion of mine,\u201d Murray says now about his drive for public service.\nMurray already had four years\u2019 experience as an assistant district attorney in Mecklenburg.

Murray worked his way up to managing partner.\nWhen Murray informed his partners he was running for the vacant district attorney\u2019s seat in 2010, attorney George Laughrun said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay.\nSince then, attorneys at Goodman Carr have backed Murray\u2019s political ambitions.\nIn October 2013, Laughrun and his wife hosted a fundraising dinner at their home for Murray.

{"idx": "8584", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: After compiling the most rushing yards for a Bears rookie in a debut, Matt Forte calmly sat down at his locker, oblivious to the hype surrounding his 123-yard, one-touchdown performance.\n\"I'm glad we won, but I'm not going to go crazy over it,\" Forte said after the Bears' surprising 29-13 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. \"It's the first game. It's a 16-game season.\"\nSeems as if Forte already has a veteran's savvy. And his confidence was evident all night, particularly after he grabbed a second-quarter pass and absorbed vicious blows from Colts defenders Clint Session and Bob Sanders. They sent Forte out of the game for a few plays and resulted in his left shoulder being heavily taped afterward. But it didn't stop Forte for long.\n\"The shoulder was a little numb,\" he admitted. \"I just went to the sideline and had to shake it off, get back in there and play.\"\nForte's fearless debut was contagious. The Bears played like they had nothing to lose and everyone's respect to gain. The defense swarmed up front and hit the Colts in the mouth early, keeping them out of the end zone in the first half. And this was practically the same Peyton Manning-led offense that outscored opponents 236-134 in first halves last season.\nThe defense kept punching in the second half, with Lance Briggs' 21-yard return of Charles Tillman's forced fumble putting the Bears up 22-13 in the third quarter. It was the second score for the defense, with a first-half safety by Adewale Ogunleye notching two points.\nManning completed 30 of 49 passes for 257 yards and a touchdown but was sacked twice. The Bears outgained the Colts 319-293.\n\"Just another week,\" Briggs said, poking fun at people's anxiety over the exhibition games. \"It's no longer preseason. This is the week that counts.\"\nA Bears team that appeared listless in the preseason suddenly came to life, and Forte provided the biggest jolt. He set the tone with a 50-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.\nThe Bears faced third-and-6 from midfield, and the Colts expected a pass play. Quarterback Kyle Orton handed off to Forte, who dipped through the middle as right guard Roberto Garza drove middle linebacker Gary Brackett to the turf. Forte then showed off his elusiveness, putting a move on defensive back Antoine Bethea before outracing Sanders to the end zone.\nForte reached the 100-yard mark on his 14th carry\u2014a 3-yard run with 24 seconds left in the first half. His total helped the Bears to 183 rushing yards on 39 carries, a healthy 4.7 yards per carry.\nForte's strong effort made life easier on Orton, who looked calm from the first snap. Make that the second, because Olin Kreutz mishandled the first, leading to a false start on the center.\nThat said, the much-maligned offensive line held up well. It gave Orton (13-for-21, 150 yards) ample opportunity to throw and cleared massive holes for Forte. Twice"}
{"idx": "8585", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If you can't bring people to the theater, sometimes it's best to bring the theater to the people.\nAt least that's the philosophy of Saul Elkin and David Bunis, the co-founders of Buffalo's Jewish Repertory Theatre, which officially opened its new theater Thursday night. They did so not in the downtown Theater District, which has been striving toward an elusive critical mass of professional theaters for years, but in suburban Getzville.\nThe Maxine and Robert Seller Theatre, located at the Getzville campus of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo, was jammed with people Thursday night for the inaugural offering, a sold-out production of William Luce's play \"Lillian\" starring company veteran Christina Rausa.\nMany had traveled a short distance to the theater from Amherst and its surrounding communities, where a large number of Western New York's Jewish residents reside. Some came from farther afield. All of them were thrilled to take part in the first opening of a new theater in Western New York in years.\nAt its heart, the JRT's decision to locate its theater in the 'burbs, while it may rankle some dedicated to the worthy goal of a truly vibrant downtown Theater District, is about facing up to facts. One of these facts is that Buffalo's population has fallen 10 percent in the past decade, while the population of Amherst has increased 5 percent, to 122,366. Another is that JRT's audience members are largely older and many more of them live in or near Amherst than in Buffalo.\nThe JRT is following the lead of Randall Kramer's MusicalFare Theatre in Snyder, where audiences increased in size between 2000 and 2010 (from 16,000 to 25,000) and artistic quality has often followed suit. Because of the new location, JRT's audience also stands to grow markedly.\nTheater directors are powerful people, capable of incredible feats of imagination. But one thing they can't do is singlehandedly reverse population trends and suburban sprawl. Nor can they simply revise the median age of their audience.\nAnd while it still makes sense to advocate fiercely for the increased health and vitality of a Buffalo-centric Theater District, a mix of arts organizations and activities that represents the changing distribution of Buffalo Niagara's population isn't necessarily a bad thing. Larger and healthier regions have theaters both in concentrated downtown pockets and in suburban outposts, a configuration from which those theater scenes clearly benefit.\nGrumbling from some in the theater community about the potential downside of establishing more professional theaters in the suburbs has been mild but audible. To them, places like MusicalFare and now JRT help to reinforce the notion of downtown Buffalo as an unfriendly or even frightening place to visit.\nBut the evidence suggests that the supposed reticence of suburbanites to make the trek downtown isn't nearly as entrenched as one might think. In the 2010-11 season, according to new numbers released by the Theatre Alliance of Buffalo, 275,000 visited Shea's Performing Arts Center alone. The other members of the alliance drew a combined 196,000 people last season to their theaters, many of which are downtown.\nThere are also some positive residual effects of establishing a theater in a place like Getzville that may not be immediately evident. The larger the audience, the bigger the chance that someone in that audience -- a grand"}

Morgan JPM, +0.43% in four to five years to start his own boutique advisory firm.\n\"I tried to get back into it,\" said Kindler, who was recruited by Colgate University for his musical skills and spent his youth playing flute and bassoon. \"Then my schedule just got to be too much. It was very disappointing to me. I just kept going and kept going and I couldn't make it anymore.\"\nThat he tried at all is an exception for someone of his ilk on Wall Street.

Morgan & Co. in 2000.\nBut Kindler, whose brother is comedian Andy Kindler, takes a different tack. He is a cutup, a clown and carries no ivy league pedigree. Born and raised in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., he went to public high school and to Colgate University where he was recruited for his musical abilities.\nAt the time, no one really figured Kindler for a deal maker, but he did show a competitive streak.\n\"He was bigger faster and smarter, so I was always trying to catch up,\" said his brother, Andy. \"It never happened. I don't recall him using the words merge or acquire, so obviously I didn't see that coming.\"\nKnown as one of the sharpest M&A attorneys on the Street, Kindler didn't know how to read company financial statements when he joined the bank.

Shaqueem Griffin (6-0, 227) finished his last year at Central Florida with 74 combined tackles, seven sacks, and one interception.\nGriffin garnered the attention of national pundits with his impressive 2017 season at UCF, and later turned heads at the combine with a blazing 4.38 40-yard dash. But he captured the attention of NFL fans all over the country with his story: he became the first one-handed player to be drafted when the Seahawks selected him with the 141st-overall pick.\nBrock\u2019s take: Huard believes the Seahawks\u2019 2018 season will be defined by the performance of notable veterans like quarterback Russell Wilson, wide receiver Doug Baldwin, left tackle Duane Brown, and linebackers Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright.\nBut incoming rookies can still make an impression and, if that impression is convincing enough, have a real impact. The key?\nHuard said what Griffin did best at UCF was manage to fly all over the football field, regardless of his position, and he\u2019s eager to see if the Seahawks\u2019 newest linebacker can bring the same energy to Seattle.\nBut it\u2019s Griffin\u2019s story that is most intriguing to Salk.

Delays, long flights and long hours can make it difficult to follow a regular diet and exercise routine. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a work day for a flight attendant may involve 12- to 14-hour shifts, and even longer ones for international flights. On average, they spend two to three nights per week away from home. For many airline professionals, this lifestyle can lead to unexpected weight gain. Lose weight while maintaining an unpredictable schedule by following a few guidelines.\nFor a flight attendant who is on her feet for hours, eating small meals more frequently can help keep energy levels high and calorie levels low. Keeping meals light and focusing on long-lasting energy is crucial to weight loss. Eat a mixture of protein, fats, and carbohydrates at each meal or snack. For example, a small handful of almonds, an apple and skim milk provides a healthy ratio of fat, protein, and carbohydrates without containing a large amount of calories. Make an effort to find fresh fruit and meals with lean protein when dining out in layover cities.\nUnpredictable hours and long days can lead to lethargy, stress and hunger. These factors can encourage weight gain when they prompt you to consume extra calories, such as a latte in the afternoon or an extra doughnut between breakfast and lunch. Curb snacking by recording what you eat and estimating the calories you consume. Use websites that offer caloric information or point systems connected with nutrition programs. Keep a notebook handy during your travels to encourage accurate record-keeping.\nFlight attendants spend many nights in hotels, most of which offer free gym access. An extra workout in the morning or at night in a hotel room can burn calories and keep you energized. An elliptical machine offers low-impact calorie burning, while running on a treadmill can burn more calories in a shorter period of time. Go for a run around your layover city to combine exercise with sightseeing. Take the stairs in the airport rather than escalators to burn extra calories during your working day.\nFlight attendants get to experience new cities, but late nights out and sleep deprivation can derail your weight-loss efforts. Jet lag, red-eye flights and frequent time changes can dramatically affect a regular sleep schedule. According to WebMD, lack of sleep can cause overconsumption of calories as sleep-deprived workers reach for coffee and high-calorie snacks to boost energy levels. Schedule time for adequate rest between flights to avoid these pitfalls and stay energized, healthy, and on track. Drink water frequently during trips to stay hydrated, and try to avoid late nights out in layover cities. Dehydration and sleep deprivation can lead to a false sense of hunger, as carbohydrates become quick energy sources for those who feel drained.\nArcher, Jan. \"How to Lose Weight for Flight Attendants.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/lose-weight-flight-attendants-10354.html.

The big news is the absence of Apple's chief executive Steve Jobs. But what other surprises and new products does Apple have planned?\nAlthough rumours persist that Apple might launch a smaller 'nano' version of its iPhone, tech experts are sceptical.\nThis year's Macworld is going to be memorable for two significant reasons -- and it's got nothing to do with new gadgets and products.\nThe first, and most astonishing reason, is that Steve Jobs, chief executive and high priest of all things Apple, will not be giving the keynote presentation for the first time in more than a decade. Instead, Phil Schiller, vice president of worldwide product marketing, will be taking to the stage.\nWhen the news of Jobs\u2019 absence broke earlier this month, the tech world was aghast \u2013 Apple was planning on holding its most high profile event without the guest of honour. Such was the level of shock and disappointment at Jobs\u2019 absence that one group of Apple fans set up a website, Silent Keynote, calling for delegates to withhold the whoops, applause and cries of \u201cYeah!\u201d that usually punctuate Apple's keynotes.\nBack in the real world, speculation, perhaps somewhat indelicately, immediately centred on Jobs\u2019 health. The Apple chief executive, who successfully battled pancreatic cancer in 2004, had looked thin and gaunt during recent public appearances, leading industry watchers and Wall Street analysts to fret about whether Jobs\u2019 cancer had returned.\nBoth Jobs and Apple have done their best to dismiss those fears, but there are still many who worry how the company will fair once its inspirational, talismanic founder steps down from the day-to-day running of his empire. Some fear there\u2019s no \u201csuccession plan\u201d in place at Apple.\nIntriguingly, we might be about to get a glimpse of Apple\u2019s future at Macworld. Phil Schiller, a regular guest speaker during Jobs\u2019 keynotes, will be taking over the role of chief spokesman in Jobs' absence. It\u2019s going to be a baptism of fire for the genial, easy-going Schiller \u2013 not only does he have to live up to a true master of ceremonies, but he\u2019ll also be keenly aware that analysts and tech experts will be running the rule over him as a potential future chief exec of the company.\nThe second reason Macworld 2009 is notable is because it\u2019s Apple\u2019s last appearance at the show. The company has been scaling back on trade shows in recent years, stating that it\u2019s no longer the best way for the company to get its message across, but it\u2019s perhaps also true that the timing of Macworld \u2013 immediately after Christmas and barely six months after Apple\u2019s own blue ribband event, the Worldwide Developers\u2019 Conference \u2013 is problematic for Apple.\nSome people hold off purchasing Apple goods for Christmas just in case a bigger and better version is announced at Macworld in January. And it leaves Apple working to an impossibly tight schedule of product releases. Tech watchers have come to expect amazing things from Apple, and there\u2019s only so many times Steve Jobs can release an iPhone-like gadget during keynote presentations.\nWhich brings us neatly on to what we can actually expect from Apple at Macworld this year. Perhaps the absence of Jobs should be viewed as an effort to manage expectations. If, as anticipated, Apple\u2019s announcements principally"}

That triggered a number of complications from which she almost died, she said.\nAn ensemble of nurses and therapists at Baltimore Healthy Start Inc. are trying to prevent moms from dying.\nThe East Baltimore nonprofit holds \u201cbelly buddy\u201d classes that teach meditation, needlework and scrap-booking to ease stress. Nurses make home visits to check on moms\u2019 well-being. Transportation and daycare are provided so pregnant women can get to checkups. Several weeks after delivery, moms are offered gift cards as an incentive to come back to the doctor\u2019s office. Complications can take moms by surprise weeks after delivery.\nYet the number of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States is on par with some underdeveloped countries. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation with a rising maternal mortality rate, according to one study led by University of Maryland researcher Marian F. MacDorman. Between 2000 and 2014, that rate increased 26 percent.\nMaryland\u2019s rate of maternal deaths was 26 deaths per 100,000 births for the five-year period 2011 to 2015, according to a maternal mortality review board under the state\u2019s department of health. The state\u2019s rate has generally been higher than the rest of the country, but was slightly lower during the time period. A federal initiative aims to bring deaths down to 11.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 births.\nA sizable racial disparity exists as well, with black women three to four times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related complication than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In Maryland, black moms die due to pregnancy 2.7 times more than white moms.\nIt is a disparity that crosses socioeconomic lines. Tennis great Serena Williams and singer Beyonce \u2014 wealthy, high-profile women with access to the best health care in the country \u2014 recently described their own pregnancy complications. Williams\u2019 near-death experience kept her in the hospital for a week.\nA day after giving birth to her daughter in Sept. 2017, Williams told CNN, she suffered from a pulmonary embolism, a condition where one or more arteries in the lungs becomes blocked by a blood clot. Her Cesarean section wound popped open because the embolism made her cough hard. In surgery to get that fixed, doctors found a large hematoma, or a swelling of clotted blood, in her abdomen. That meant another surgery to prevent the clots from moving to her lungs.\nBeyonce told Vogue magazine \"toxemia,\u201d sudden high blood pressure and protein in the urine, landed her on bed rest for a month before giving birth to twins by C-section in June 2017.\nThe high rates of maternal mortality are a puzzling, and some say tragic, problem that has existed for decades. Why, with all the medical advances, are moms dying?\nSubstance abuse and unintentional overdose were the leading cause of maternal death in Maryland in 2015.

{"idx": "8609", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The USPS has been declared insolvent, but it is not because it is inefficient (it has been self-funded throughout its history). It is because in 2006, Congress required it to prefund postal retiree health benefits for 75 years into the future, an onerous burden no other public or private company is required to carry. The USPS has evidently been targeted by a plutocratic Congress bent on destroying the most powerful unions and privatizing all public services, including education. Britain\u2019s 150-year-old postal service is also on the privatization chopping block, and its postal workers have also vowed to fight. Adding banking services is an internationally proven way to maintain post office solvency and profitability.\nMany countries operate postal savings systems through their post offices, providing people without access to banks a safe, convenient way to save. Great Britain first offered this arrangement in 1861. It was wildly popular, attracting over 600,000 accounts and \u00a38.2 million in deposits in its first five years. By 1927, there were twelve million accounts\u2014one in four Britons\u2014with \u00a3283 million on deposit.\nThe essential characteristic distinguishing postal financial services from the private banking sector is the obligation and capacity of the postal system to serve the entire spectrum of the national population, unlike conventional private banks which allocate their institutional resources to service the sectors of the population they deem most profitable.\nServing the unbanked and underbanked may sound like a losing proposition, but numerous precedents show that postal savings banks serving low-income and rural populations can be quite profitable. (See below.) In many countries, according to the UN Paper, banking revenues are actually crucial to maintaining the profitability of their postal network. Letter delivery generates losses and often requires cross-subsidies from other activities to maintain its network. One effective solution has been to create or expand postal financial services.\nPublic postal banks are profitable because their market is large and their costs are low: the infrastructure is already built and available, advertising costs are minimal, and government-owned banks do not award their management extravagant bonuses or commissions that drain profits away. Profits return to the government and the people.\nProfits return to the government in another way: money that comes out from under mattresses and gets deposited in savings accounts can be used to purchase government bonds. Japan Post Bank, for example, holds 20% of Japan\u2019s national debt. The government has its own captive public lender, servicing the debt at low interest without risking the vagaries of the international bond market. Fully 95% of Japan\u2019s national debt is held domestically in one way or another. That helps explain how Japan can have the worst debt-to-GDP ratio of any major country and still maintain its standing as the world\u2019s largest creditor.\nNew Zealand\u2019s profitable postal bank had a return on equity of 11.7% in the second half of 2011, with net profits almost trebling. It is the only New Zealand bank able to compete with the big four Australian banks that dominate the New Zealand financial sector.\nIn fact, it was set up for that purpose. By 2001, Australian mega-banks controlled some 80% of New Zealand\u2019s retail banking. Profits went abroad and were maximized by closing less profitable branches, especially in rural areas. The New Zealand government decided to launch a state-owned bank that would compete with the Aussie banks. To keep costs low while still providing services throughout New Zealand, the planning"}

{"idx": "8614", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: I seem to have a more difficult time each year getting into the spirit of Christmas. I am not sure if that is because the youngest of my four children is now sixteen, or the ever present commercialism that puts me off in such a way, that I attempt to have no part in it. My eldest and I joke that it should be called 'Giftmas'.\nI feel almost justified about going easy on the holiday season now as I feel I gave my children idyllic childhood Christmas'. Something I grew up with. Before moving to The Bahamas we lived in a log home in North Vancouver on the ocean at the base of a mountain, and it was a picture perfect scene each year. When we moved we carried all our Christmas heirlooms with us. I ended up getting rid of most of them when we returned to Canada, all save the baby ornaments that were bought for each child in their first year of life, each containing a baby photo.\nMy youngest child pushes me each year, and I applaud her spirit, because if it were not for her 'need' to feel akin to her memories of family, I know we'd still get together on Christmas day, but it might be a bit more sparse. She always insists on a live tree, and we have a perfect one again in our living room, despite having to yet figure out how to dispose of it from our highrise dwelling in January! Last year my son and I sawed the tree into one foot segments and bagged it for disposal, leaving a brutal needle scene in our living room.\nAfter getting snapped into my senses, for the love of my family, I push myself into the decorating, music, shopping, planning, purchasing of goodies and boxed chocolates, eggnog, Christmas crackers, etc. In the end, I never, ever, regret the time I take, nor the money I spend, to pull together the holiday spirit.\nIn reflection, I realize it is THE one time of the year that we set aside, at minimum a few days, and at best a couple weeks, to focus on family. In our fast paced world, (and we need only reflect on how FAST the past year flew by!) it would be easy to just coast from one day to the next, one month to the next, or one year to the next as we numb ourselves out with electronic gadgets (or whatever it is that keeps us 'busy') that make us feel plugged into the oneness of life.\nNo other time of the year (unless you are on a vacation away) does their come that feeling of 'just slow down'... and I know I most certainly need it! The holiday season can renew our faith (whatever yours may be), our love (for self, family, etc), and our mental health.\nSo as I sit in my holiday-hued home, I hope that my Christmas heirlooms are somewhere being enjoyed in The Bahamas, whether in a classroom or in someone's family. These were gifts that were given to my family, and many hand-made with love. All were annual reminders of the bigger family that we are all a part of.\nI want to take this time to wish you and yours the peace that CAN be found in the holiday season. It's simply a choice. Be flexible and allow the spirit of family to fill you. There are no regrets in efforts we put toward our loved ones."}

There is even a mass sexual harassment like the incident of last Eid Al-Fitr (Lesser Bairam) in Cairo streets, first stirred by a notorious female entertainer. That day was called since then \" Black Tuesday \" in Egypt. The latest mass sexual harassment incident took place on Monday evening, July, 2nd, 2007, after the end of the soccer match between Al-Ahli and Al Zamalek, leading teams of the Egyptian soccer. Fans of both teams went out of Cairo stadium to spread in various districts, to express their happiness or sadness but in a hideous and outlandish manner. Many young men assaulted young girls and even old women in the midst of a complete lack of security.\nIkhwanweb held a phone interview with Naglaa Imam, the manager of Bariq society for fighting violence against women. She said: \"The current chaos in Egypt is a social phenomenon that spawns all individual and mass crimes. Generally speaking, any gathering of any kind these days in Egypt will spawn crimes, specially sexual harassments, rapes and assaults..etc. The mass sexual harassment against girls was a natural reaction for such a huge gathering of youth, gatherings which are mostly accompanied by a state of security chaos and also a kind of criminal appearances, like blocking streets and stopping traffic, breaking cars and even sometimes opening other cars and grabbing any person inside them, men or women. This is definitely due to a state of full security deterioration, a full absence of security. This also due to making security focus on only single person in this country, the president for whose safety any security can be violated and any role can be broken. No attention to given to any man, woman or child in this country.\n\"We are living in the age of creative chaos, which can spawn any crime that one\u2019s mind may imagine. Egypt sees highwaymen with no confrontation from any security service. Sexual harassments are committed in public without taking any real step to face them\" she added.\nRegarding the main reasons for the spread of the phenomenon of mass sexual harassment in Egypt, Naglaa Imam said:\" to say it in a nutshell, there is no religious or moral deterrent. The exaggerated happiness and ecstasy of the young men after every soccer match, leading to the above mentioned bad conduct. There is no deterrent to prevent them from carrying out such acts of sabotage. Add to this the very widespread unemployment among young men. The corrupt media\u2019s rude, impudent and debauch scenes. The young men\u2019s rejectionist attitudes towards all daily incidents in Egypt. The result is that the society is currently divided into two parts: criminals and victims. There is no security service to confront criminals or protect victims.\"\nFor her part, Gihan Al Halafawi, a Muslim Brotherhood female leader and a candidate for 2000 legislative elections, said about the phenomenon of mass sexual harassment against girls:\" This phenomenon is relatively new to the Egyptian society. However, it is unfortunately a natural result of the current problems in Egypt, including absence of religious values, deterioration of moral values, losing identity and that the youth have lost any hope in the future.

But such visits also can uncover issues, including congenital heart defects.\nCongenital heart defects or diseases are defined as problems with the heart\u2019s structure that are present at birth, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. These defects can change the normal flow of blood to the heart, which may cause it to slow down, be blocked or go in the wrong direction.\nThe Mayo Clinic says that defects can range from simple issues that might cause no noticeable problems to complex conditions that can be life-threatening. Many doctors are able to diagnose defects during pregnancy or soon after birth using special cardiac testing. Examples of problems can include an atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect and a patent ductus arteriosus.\nMany of the defects are characterized by holes or openings in the heart. Some defects resolve on their own. Others may require surgery or cardiac catheterization.\nResearchers say that, while they do not fully understand why congenital heart defects occur, the risk of having a baby with one is influenced by family history, genetics and exposure to certain environmental factors during pregnancy. Children also may be at greater risk if their mothers have diabetes, rubella or phenylketonuria. Boys have a slightly higher risk for congenital heart defects than girls.\nNHLBI advises that advances in diagnosis and treatment allow most children with congenital heart diseases to survive to adulthood.\nHowever, even if a congenital heart defect was repaired in childhood, one needs regular medical follow-ups throughout life to maintain good health. Follow-up care includes routine visits with a cardiologist, heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, and being physically active within recommendations designed for the specific heart anomaly.\nIt\u2019s important to note that some children can experience developmental delays and lower body weight due to heart defects.\nCongenital heart defects are somewhat common. Thanks to advanced screening and thorough treatment methods, many children born with such defects go on to lead long lives."}

But the plea nonetheless makes Manafort the latest associate of Trump, a president known to place a premium on loyalty among subordinates, to admit guilt and cooperate with investigators in hopes of leniency.\nIn the past year, Mueller has secured pleas from a former national security adviser who lied to the FBI about discussing sanctions with a Russian ambassador, a campaign aide who broached the idea of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and another aide who was indicted alongside Manafort but ultimately turned on him. The president's former personal lawyer has separately pleaded guilty in New York.\nFriday's deal, to charges tied to Ukrainian political consulting work but unrelated to the campaign, was struck just days before Manafort was to have stood trial for a second time.\nHe smiled broadly as he entered the courtroom Friday but gave terse and barely audible answers during questioning from the judge.\nThe cooperation deal requires Manafort to provide whatever information the government asks of him, though it does not specify what if anything prosecutors hope to receive about Trump.\nGiven his direct involvement in the Trump campaign, including episodes being scrutinized by Mueller, Manafort could be positioned to provide key insight for investigators working to establish whether the campaign coordinated with Russia.\nManafort was among the participants, for instance, in a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians and the president's oldest son and son-in-law that was arranged so the campaign could receive derogatory information about Democrat Hillary Clinton. A grand jury used by Mueller has heard testimony about the meeting.\nHe was also a close business associate of a man who U.S. intelligence believes has ties to Russian intelligence. And while he was working on the Trump campaign, emails show Manafort discussed providing private briefings for a wealthy Russian businessman close to Vladimir Putin.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted that the Manafort case was unrelated to Trump.\nAdded Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani: \"Once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign.\"\nUnder the terms of the deal, Manafort was allowed to plead guilty to just two conspiracy counts, though the crimes he admitted cover the same conduct alleged in an indictment last year. Manafort's homes in New York City, in the Hamptons and in Virginia, as well as money from his bank accounts and life insurance policies may be seized by the government as part of the deal.\nIt's unclear how the deal might affect any Manafort pursuit of a pardon from Trump. The president has signaled that he's sympathetic to Manafort's cause. In comments to Politico before the plea deal, Giuliani said a plea without a cooperation agreement wouldn't foreclose the possibility of a pardon.\nIn the current Washington case, prosecutors had been expected"}

After returning to his home in Istanbul, he flew out of Istanbul to the U.S. on Oct. 25 without incident.\nAs a Canadian-American, Byle had no valid residence permit to present to officers conducting routine ID checks when he arrived from Istanbul at the Ankara train station.\nBut when he was taken to the Turkish capital's Anti-Terror Police Department, officials quickly confirmed that their latest Western-citizen detainee had in fact been staying in the country legally for the past 1.5 years, protected by a temporary constitutional-court order blocking a previous criminal-court order that had called for his deportation and subsequent re-entry ban.\n\"They would have no legal grounds to deport me if I was charged only over my religious activities, none of which are illegal under Turkish law, and are in fact protected by the Turkish Constitution. So they needed a more legally justifiable reason to deport me.\"\nTurkey's highest court had blocked Byle's lower-court rulings in February 2017, suspending the earlier directives claiming that his \"Christian propaganda activities exceeded usual religious rituals.\" Accordingly, the court had concluded that members of other religions could perceive him as a threat, so the Turkish government had the right to consider him a threat to public order and national security.\nByle's latest arrest this month was not a new experience for the 49-year-old evangelist, who has during his 19 years in Turkey faced a number of similar short-term detentions and interrogations, three times resulting in attempted deportations (stopped in the end by court rulings), and stays abroad for several months to comply with Turkish-visa regulations.\nAlthough throughout the years Byle's visa renewal requests were repeatedly declined or left unanswered, various criminal charges against him were eventually dropped by local courts, bowing to national laws defining missionary activities as legal and confirming that the Christian literature he distributed did not slander Islam.\nEven so, Byle told World Watch Monitor he wasn't surprised when he was informed shortly after his Ankara arrest that he was to be deported immediately, the very next day. But the authorities' plans later changed, possibly after learning that his constitutional-court decision was still in effect, prohibiting his legal deportation until the higher court actually reviewed his case and gave a final ruling, confirming whether the allegations against him were backed by credible evidence.\n\"For many hours I was interrogated by multiple policemen, who painstakingly typed up my answers in their computer,\" Byle said. \"One of the interrogators was obviously from the secret police, as he knew the names of all sorts of Christian workers and activities around the country, and asked me about my connections with them.\"\nAt one point, Byle said his interrogators discussed back and forth with each other how to specify in writing the exact charges of which he was being accused, to explain the reason for his deportation.

He added that some people have also been detained.\nWith thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members and even secular activists in jail, and many others having left country since el-Sissi led the army's 2013 overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president, massive demonstrations are unlikely in the capital's greater area, home to some 20 million inhabitants.\nThe security presence and incursions in Cairo have been greater than in previous years, when authorities also feared anniversary protests. The roundup of activists and the closure of several cultural venues in Cairo considered by authorities to be possible harbors for dissenting views also marked an escalation from previous pre-emptive clampdowns by security services.\n\"The Ministry of Interior has been very active at targeting people to date,\" he said. \"In order to get into the accounts and shut down pages they need to either trick someone into revealing a password, or use malware to get them to reveal personal data.\"\nState and the overwhelmingly pro-government private media have also been urging the public not to demonstrate on Jan. 25, which is also National Police Day, arguing that protests would bring only chaos. Weekly sermons at mosques, which are based on guidelines provided by the state, have also been preaching against demonstrating for weeks.\nOne resident, an online marketer, arrived home earlier this week to find a dozen plainclothes officers inside his building, coaxing the doorman to ask residents to cooperate by offering up their mobile devices for inspection.\nThe anniversary comes at a time when the economy, buttressed in the early days of el-Sissi's leadership by aid from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, is growing slower than authorities had hoped, casting a cloud over el-Sissi's promises to set the country on track to prosperity. At the same time, a wave of suicide bombings and militant attacks has intensified since el-Sissi led the army's ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Over the past year, most of these attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group.\nLate Thursday, a bomb went off during a raid on a home in Cairo's twin city of Giza where militants were preparing explosives, killing six people including at least three policemen and one civilian, and wounding 13 people, police said in a statement.\nEarlier in the day, an Egyptian affiliate of IS claimed responsibility for an attack on a checkpoint in the country's volatile Sinai Peninsula that killed five policemen. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim, which was issued via a statement circulated by the group's sympathizers on social media, however the design and logo resembled previous IS claims.\nAssociated Press writer Nour Youssef contributed to this report."}

It is a progressive disease, and symptoms get worse over time.\nNeuropathy happens when high levels of fats or sugar in the blood damage the nerves in the body. It can affect virtually any nerve in the body, with a wide range of symptoms.\nNerves are essential to how the body works. They enable people to move, send messages about how things feel, and control automatic functions, such as breathing.\nThere are several types. Some involve the peripheral nerves, while others damage the nerves that supply the internal organs, such as the heart, the bladder, and the gut. In this way, it can affect many body functions.\nBetween one-third and a half of people with diabetes have neuropathy, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\nIn this article, we explore the different types, effects, and risks of diabetic neuropathy.\nPeripheral neuropathy can lead to a loss of sensation in the feet.\nPeripheral symmetric neuropathy: This affects the feet and hands. It is the most common form of diabetic neuropathy.\nAutonomic neuropathy: This occurs in the nerves that control involuntary functions of the body, such as digestion, urination, or heart rate.\nThoracic and lumbar root, or proximal, neuropathy: This damages nerves along a specific distribution in the body, such as the chest wall or legs.\nMononeuropathies: These can affect any individual nerve.\nThe symptoms of neuropathy depend on the type and the nerves involved.\nThe signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy usually take several years to appear. Signs and symptoms will depend on which type of neuropathy and nerves it affects.\nPeripheral neuropathy that affects the feet can make it difficult for a person to stand and walk. It can increase the risk of falling.\nWhen a person cannot feel heat, cold or injury, this can lead to new problems.\nFor example, a blister on the foot can become ulcerated because the person did not feel pain in the early stages. As the infection progresses, gangrene can develop.\nEventually, amputation may be necessary.\nThere are many types of neuropathy.\nProximal neuropathy can lead to pain in the lower body, often on one side, and weakness in the legs.\nSymptoms of focal neuropathy can vary widely, depending on the nerve affected. Focal neuropathy and cranial neuropathy can both lead to visual disturbances, such as double vision.\nPeople with diabetic neuropathy often do not realize they have it until the symptoms are more advanced.\nNot all of the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are visible, but people should be aware of any wounds on their feet.\nSmall problems, such as eczema, can be more serious when a person has diabetes, as the person may not notice that the wound is getting worse. Wounds can also take longer to heal, due to the effect of diabetes.\nPeople should check regularly for blisters and other small skin wounds, as peripheral neuropathy can make them hard to notice and they can become ulcerated.\nA physician will carry out a foot exam and may check blood pressure.\nOther tests may include a check of blood pressure and fluctuations in heart rate.\nDiabetes reduces a person's ability to use insulin to process glucose in the blood"}

Her mother is Sybil Burton, the late actor`s first wife, who, in the mid-1960s, achieved fame as the proprietess of the popular New York disco Arthur.\nConsidering that her father played Hamlet, Mark Antony, Faust and Henry VIII, Burton is as surprised as anyone that she`s making her feature debut in ''Big Trouble in Little China'' (she appeared with her father in the TV mini-series ''Ellis Island''). ''Big Trouble'' is a splashy adventure fable starring Kurt Russell in which she plays a daffy but determined newspaper reporter.\n''I always thought that I would wind up making my film debut in something done by (the production company) Merchant-Ivory. You know, a film like `Room With a View` or `The Bostonians,` where I would wear a long scarf and wave at someone across a beautiful landscape. It would be very artistic and very dignified and very slow.\nOutgoing and unaffected, the 28-year-old Burton discusses her father freely.\n''It`s ridiculous to assume people don`t want to ask about him, and he was an important part of my life,'' she said. ''I actually had a normal childhood with a very supportive family.\nNevertheless, the senior Burton had reservations about his daughter entering the acting profession.\nAlthough she`s obviously fond of her father, her chief praise is for her mother.\n''I think she`s the reason I`m normal. She`s an incredible mother. She was there all the time for me, even when she had Arthur, the disco. Mom`s had amazingly lucrative offers to write books about my dad. But she never will.'' Burton is married to Broadway production stage manager A. Michael Ritchie (no relation to film director Michael Ritchie).\nRegarding her acting career, she says she has no idea what the future holds.\n''I`m not a type. I`m not a real dish, and I`m too young to be a character actress. I think that will help the durability of my career, but right now it makes casting a little difficult. But I knew I wanted to be an actress, at least from my senior year of college. Even before that, really. Whenever I had to study Russian history, I wound up studying Chekhov."}

He left for a pinch-hitter in the sixth but struck out nine Nationals.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gabe Kapler noticed how much in command Zach Eflin was on the mound Tuesday night in what became an 8-2 Phillies win over the Washington Nationals. The Phillies manager also noticed how cool his starting pitcher was at the plate in the fourth inning.\nIt was there that Eflin, following the second of what would be three consecutive intentional walks to Maikel Franco, loading the bases with two outs. Eflin would make Max Scherzer and the Nationals pay.\nFirst, Eflin fouled off three straight pitches from the Nationals ace. Then he took a few more, one of them getting past catcher Yan Gomes, scoring Odubel Herrera for a very welcomed Phillies second run.\n\"Sometimes those little things go unnoticed,\" Kapler said, \"when (Bryce) Harper swings the bat like he did and Odubel swings the bat like he did and Maikel Franco's on base five times. Those tiny little details get missed. Those are huge plays in this game.\"\nKapler referenced Harper, who had a memorable night with a single, double, home run and three RBIs in his return to Nationals Park. He also commended the patience of Franco (two hits, three intentional walks) and Odubel Herrera's three doubles. All of that lifted the Phillies' run total to 31 for their four winning games thus far in 2019, and made it an easy night of sorts for Eflin, who went five strong innings and tying his career high of nine strikeouts.\n\"I think he's going to go into his next start especially confident,\" Kapler said. \"Most importantly for Eflin is his command. He knew where the ball was going, he put it where he wanted to put it and he commanded it both in and out of the zone. That's an important factor for him.\"\nBut then there was that at-bat, which for Eflin was almost as much fun as frustrating the Nats.\n\"I thought it was awesome that I did it,\" he said. \"I thought it was pretty cool. At the end of the day I worked the count and we had a guy score on a (passed ball). So I thought that was pretty beneficial to the team. I kind of felt good ... yeah, it was pretty cool.\""}

This is because for many decades the Arab masses were accustomed to hearing one leader and one candidate. Today, they feel democracy has indeed been attained. They also feel that their next president, whoever he may be, will not be a gift from a merciful providence, or a leader for whom the nation must sacrifice its blood and soul. Instead, they believe he will be an ordinary human being like them. He will be grilled and interrogated, and he may choose to give straight answers sometimes and be evasive on other occasions. In the end, they will choose him by their own free will and according to their own convictions.\nFrom the standpoint of substance, the debate examined at length the vision of the two candidates on how to revive Egypt's economy, health and education. More importantly, it also dealt with the relationship between religion and the state. While Moussa spoke about Islamic values such as justice and equality as the basis of legislation, Abul-Futoh spoke about the implementation of the Islamic laws (sharia) that would assure national harmony and freedom of religion.\nAs for their positions towards Israel, that part of the debate was controversial, to say the least. Whereas Moussa referred to Israel as an adversary, Abul-Futoh regarded it as an enemy.\nNaturally, it is important to assess these positions within the context of the election campaigns. So even though Abul-Futoh described Israel as an enemy, that does not mean he would prepare for war if elected. It is certain that the priorities of the next president will not be ideological. Instead, he will be preoccupied by the economic needs of the state and its political interests.\nAlthough the electoral map includes 13 candidates, there are three clear frontrunners. Since the elections will be in two stages, it is expected that two of these three will contest the second run-off. Each one of them has his own distinctive features.\nMoussa, 76, presents himself as the experienced statesman who will deliver stability in the midst of an uncertain economic climate. Having worked as foreign minister under Hosni Mubarak and secretary general of the Arab League, he would be the preferred choice of the ruling military council, the intelligence agencies and large sections of the Egyptian bureaucracy. Indeed, sizeable sections of the population see in him a guardian of economic stability. On the other hand, many others view him as an extension of the defunct regime and, therefore, he contradicts the spirit of the people's revolution.\nAbul-Futoh, 62 \u2013 who is renowned for his opposition to the Sadat and Mubarak regimes, for which he was imprisoned \u2013 presents himself as the candidate of the revolution who is able to reach out to the youth and various political forces. He promises not to take unilateral decisions, but instead work with a team of experts. This contrasts with Moussa, who appeared in the debate to be notably self-centred. It should be noted, though, that the latter has some Islamic credentials and enjoys reasonable support among the Salafists. In fact, key figures among the secularists, leftists and liberals have declared their support for him; a precedent not offered to any other. On this basis, Moussa could qualify for the second round.\nThe third candidate is Mohammad Mursi, 6"}

Raul Bocanegra. Bocanegra, who in recent years alternated terms with community activist Patty Lopez, resigned last November in the wake of multiple reports of sexual misconduct.\nHis resignation left the 39th Assembly district without representation for several months.\nIn April, voters advanced Democrat Luz Rivas and Republican Ricardo Benitez from a field of six to a special election in June to serve out the final quarter of Bocanegra\u2019s term.\nIn June, Rivas defeated Benitez by a more than two-to-one margin to serve out the term. Meanwhile, Rivas and Benitez also advanced to an election this November to decide who will serve a full-term to represent the district.\nThat is the decision voters in the 39th Assembly district have before them this November.\nIn our view, Rivas is the best positioned to deliver results for the district, and we endorse her re-election.\nRivas, who holds a Master of Education degree from Harvard and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from MIT, has close ties to the community. Born in Los Angeles to Mexican immigrants and raised in Pacoima, Rivas founded the nonprofit DIY Girls in 2011 to help encourage girls to become interested in science and mathematics. In 2016, she was appointed to the Board of Public Works by Mayor Eric Garcetti.\nIn a meeting with our editorial board earlier this year, Rivas expressed concern with the high-speed rail project and had questions about the ability of the state to pay for a single-payer system. These are instincts we encourage Rivas to heed.\nAnd on the issue of homelessness, Rivas has rightly indicated support for more housing construction and mental health services. To the latter point, we encourage Rivas to push for responsible spending of Mental Health Services Act funds.\nRunning against Rivas is Republican Ricardo Benitez, who has sought office multiple times over the last six years. While we appreciate his consistent willingness to serve as a Republican alternative, we\u2019d encourage Benitez to seek more local offices, where he might better be able to prevail and effect tangible change.\nBut for now, Luz Rivas is a sensible choice for Assembly and we encourage her re-election."}

As a group, it was definitely my favorite, and even as individual films these might have been my favorite four of the entire project. To end with a movie as thought provoking as Silence was stellar as well.\nMy favorite movie of the 2010s was Django Unchained, but Whiplash gave it a run for its money. The two films could not be more different in terms of plot, with one being a violent Western and the other a jazz film, but both movies shared the benefits of a terrific cast and an amazing soundtrack. Django edged out Whiplash only because of my personal movie preferences, not any fault of the latter film.\nMy least favorite film of the 2010s was Silence, but it really was still a great movie. The acting of Andrew Garfield carried the movie, but I was not as sold on Adam Driver\u2019s performance. In the end, though, it was really the acting of the Japanese characters that took the movie from good to great, and the locations where the film was shot were gorgeous. Silence may have been my least favorite film of the decade, but it still lands pretty high on my overall rankings.\nThe 2010s were unusual in that they finally broke the continuing trend of increased adult content from decade to decade that had carried on throughout the entire project. In the end, the 2000s ranked supreme in adult content, but the 2010s still came in second. This observation is interesting, as it could suggest that movies have potentially plateaued in the amount of adult content they have on average, but this will not be conclusive until more time has passed and more movies are made.\nIt\u2019s interesting that you note that adult content in films has decreased since the 2000\u2019s, especially considering that news media seems to portray this decade as much more aggressive and has characterized it as a reduction of the moral values of society as compared to the past. Do you think that there is any reason why society\u2019s acceptance of immoral content has increased general? Also, is there any reason why society has reversed course in the last decade? Or is this perception a result of small sample size?\nI think that this decrease in adult content in the 2010s more symbolizes a plateau in desensitization rather than a reverse in course, and this is probably because of the said small sample size. When watching the 2000s versus the 2010s, the movies all felt similar to each other in their approaches to adult content portrayal. In fact, I would almost lump the 90s in there too, as Pulp Fiction seemed to usher in this whole era of movies that nearly disregard the idea of excessive gore or sexuality. In the end, I cannot say if the future will bring more or less adult content in movies, but my feeling towards the drop off in the 2010s is that it shows that almost a ceiling has been reached in regards to how much adult content can be crammed into an 120-minute film."}

Americans have been fighting over the issue for more than half a century, but the decisive legal blow may come just as the technology to make affirmative action more effective is finally at hand.\nTechnologies such as data mining and machine learning have made us all more visible. Computer algorithms can infer intimate details about a person, from race to political orientation to personality characteristics, by looking at a plethora of other details in that person\u2019s online behavior. This kind of technology is already changing the way colleges market themselves to prospective students. Recruiters can target underrepresented niches \u2014 say, middle-class Latino athletes who like classical music \u2014 with greater precision than ever before.\nSomeday soon, data science could help colleges sort through applications as well. Schools could make decisions based not only on the information students provide on their applications, but also on rich data profiles that bring in a student\u2019s socioeconomic background and also a host of other variables.\nLike other selective schools, Harvard tries to admit a class of students who are more representative of the overall population than a class chosen by GPAs and test scores alone would be. But the legal landscape for affirmative action has been murky: the Supreme Court has held that admissions officers can use a student\u2019s race as a factor, but not the deciding factor in admissions; and while quotas are forbidden, highly selective universities have been free to evaluate applicants in a more holistic way.\nWhen deluged with tens of thousands of applications, admissions officers may struggle to take in the big picture all at once. Fatefully, Harvard asked application readers to break applicants down according to a small number of traits, from academic achievement to athletic potential. The plaintiffs accuse the school of holding down the number of Asian-American students, not least by consistently giving them lower ratings for their subjective personal qualities.\nCritics of the current system might not be reassured if human admissions officers instead outsourced admissions decisions to powerful computer algorithms. But computers are more adept than humans at making yes-or-no, up-or-down decisions based on dozens or hundreds of variables at once \u2014 and could provide a way for universities to build diversity without considering race directly.\nLIke any other business, colleges have started using tracking programs to follow their customers around the Internet.

Jane Brophy, the Liberal Democrat candidate followed on 34,334, with the Green party\u2019s Will Patterson on 13,424. Ukip\u2019s Shneur Odze was sixth on 10,583, behind the English Democrats\u2019 candidate.\nHis victory came as little surprise in a region where Labour controls nine of the 10 councils and has all but five of the 28 MPs, but the margin was seen as emphatic amid an otherwise difficult set of election results for Labour.\nBurnham won votes by promising to eradicate rough sleeping on Greater Manchester\u2019s streets by 2020, pledging 15% of his \u00a3110,000 salary to a new charity, the Mayor\u2019s Homelessness Fund, which he will launch on Monday.\nHe said: \u201cHere in this city we will never accept it as an inevitable consequence of modern life that for some people to succeed, others have to sleep rough on our cold streets. Rising homelessness is the issue that has defined this campaign.\nRobin Garrido, a Conservative councillor in Salford, said he was surprised by the scale of Burnham\u2019s victory. \u201cI think he won because he\u2019s well known. Rather than being a Labour vote, I think this was an Andy Burnham vote,\u201d he said.\nAnstee, the Tory candidate, is the 29-year-old leader of the council in Trafford, Greater Manchester\u2019s most affluent borough, who grew up in a council house. He was one of the architects of the devolution deal that saw Greater Manchester become the first city region to agree to an elected mayor in return for powers from Westminster, in November 2014.\nBy some measures, Burnham will now have more power than the mayor of London, his Labour colleague Sadiq Khan. He will have various Greater Manchester-wide powers and responsibilities including for the fire service, transport, planning and housing and those previously held by the police and crime commissioner (PCC), Tony Lloyd, who lost his job the moment the result was announced.\nBurnham, a former health secretary, will also be the only elected mayor in the UK to have oversight of the health and social care budget, newly integrated and worth \u00a36bn."}

You could probably write the script: times are tough, we\u2019re well positioned, we\u2019re focusing on our great brands, \u201cability to make compelling content on a consistent basis.\u201d No announcement of an AOL (NYSE: TWX) sale for anyone who still thinks that\u2019s imminent.\nIn his prepared comments, Bewkes compared the Time Inc restructuring announced last week to the first quarter \u201chard look\u201d at New Line, calling it \u201cthe most comprehensive overhaul in Time Inc history\u201d enabling \u201csimilar titles for the first time to share some editorial and sales infrastructure.\u201d It will \u201cstreamline management\u201d and speed up decision making\u201d by integrating digital and print. And aligning like titles will allow Time Inc to ensure that resources are being concentrated on the \u201cbiggest and most promising brands\u201d at scale. His example: People, the division\u2019s most profitable title, which delivered a modest gain in print and online advertising \u201cdespite its size in a difficult third quarter.\u201d TW expects to generate \u201cat least $150 million in annual run rate savings starting in 2009.\n\u2014 AOL: Bekes mentioned weak advertising sectors like mortgage financing and autos but offered a batch of traffic stats to show \u201cmore evidence that our redesigns over the last two years and the new niche sites AOL has launched are succeeding.\u201d CFO John Martin got down to the nitty-gritty of the unit\u2019s mixed results\u2013 strong usage growth mixed with disappointment on the ad side and dash of hope. Display advertising dropped 15 percent to $181 million and the total ad drop of 6 percent almost took AOL below $500 million in ad revenue for the quarter; total advertising consists of roughly one-third each of paid search, display and third-party networks. Third-party numbers continue to be slammed by the loss of major customer Apollo, which swallowed any advantage from acquisitions, dropping 12 percent to $144 million. Apollo\u2019s loss cost Platform-A $55 million for the quarter while acquisitions brought in $29 million over Q307. Take out Apollo, which they\u2019ll be able to do after it haunts again in Q4, and third-party revenues would have been up 7 percent. In keeping with the mixed messages, that 7 percent is still lower than the growth AOL had been seeing \u201cdue to both the decline in branded advertising as well as lower consumer response to our performance advertising.\u201d Paid search was up 12 percent on increases in revenue per query.\n\u2014 M&A: With the expected $11 billion dividend from the TWC spin confirmed again today and some other moves, TW\u2019s piggybank is going to gain considerable weight. What will they do with the money? Possibilities include some shopping. Martin: \u201cWe\u2019d be looking to do a few things, one, potentially doing acquisitions that we believe would add and create value once they\u2019re put through a disciplined filter or process to make sure that they actually are additive. There\u2019s nothing that we see as a must have and we don\u2019t see any strategic holes in our portfolio right now. Jessica Reif Cohen tried again by asking about the asset mix over the next three years. Bewkes, in the understatement of the day: \u201cIn the media business we all know there\u2019s been a lot of value destroyed through poor acquisitions and poor capital allocations.

Such gifts usually involved spirits and watches, he said, rather than bags and clothing.\nLongchamp\u2019s core business is women\u2019s handbags, with its best-selling Pliage bag starting under a 100 euros and leather handbags starting at around 370 euros.\nCassegrain said Longchamp, present in China since 2006, ran about 20 shops there, and was looking to open more in the years to come. He would not give a specific target. Longchamp closed two shops in China last year and opened six.\nHe said finding the best spots was difficult because new malls were constantly being built, sometimes rendering obsolete those that opened just three or four years ago.\nCassegrain said Longchamp\u2019s sales in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong rose 26 percent last year, but remained somewhat sluggish in Europe after years of strong growth.\nThe brand has 60 percent of its turnover in Europe and sales of 462 million euros last year. Growth slowed to 4 percent last year from 16 percent in 2012 and 20 percent in 2011.\nCassegrain is hoping for double-digit growth in 2014 and said the year had started well, helped by recovery in Europe and expansion in Asia.\nHe said that last year Chinese buyers, including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan, had become the brand\u2019s second most important customers behind the French and before the Americans.\nLongchamp had just opened a permanent office in Moscow and is more concerned about red tape there than the Ukrainian crisis.\nLongchamp recently bought back three franchise boutiques, one in St Petersburg and two in Moscow.\nRussians are the world\u2019s No.2 spenders while overseas after the Chinese, and their top three destinations are Rome, Paris and Milan, a study by VAT-refund company Global Blue showed this week."}

This moratorium is super indiscriminate. The unintended consequences are mind boggling.\"\nThe ordinance, passed on emergency, prohibits the creation of any additional floor area, as well as any demolition that results in the removal of any multi-family or commercial floor area.\nThere are exemptions for housing communities under four acres; larger housing developments can be permitted if they provide all the required affordable units on site. Property owned by Colorado nonprofits also is exempt.\nMany other avenues were discussed and tabled for later: Several council members proposed rent protections for mobile home communities and additional affordable housing requirements. Grano suggested exemptions for properties that, by definition, do not qualify for opportunity zone funds.\nWhat, exactly, those might be, are still in flux: The federal program \u2014 whereby capital gains taxes can be deferred, reduced or eliminated when invested in opportunity zones \u2014 is still being developed. Councilwoman Mary Young and others were hopeful that Boulder could take advantage of the program, perhaps establishing a local opportunity fund to invest in things like mobile home infrastructure.\nThough the moratorium is in place through June 22, 2020, council members in the majority expressed hope that bits of it could be chipped away as regulations are firmed up for various zoning districts in the area, which runs from 28th to 55th streets and Arapahoe to Diagonal Highway.\nMayor Suzanne Jones pointed out that, while an update of the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan was just completed, the development rules that will codify its vision are not yet in place. Those are scheduled for undertaking in 2019 and 2020.\n\"We have rules we need to update,\" Jones said. \"As Macy's just illustrated. They put in something based on the old vision and we need to have the new vision in place.\"\nCouncilman Aaron Brockett contended that process is further delayed by the time that will be spent on the moratorium.\n\"Those projects keep receding farther from the horizon,\" he said. \"I'd rather be working on those than up here at 1 o'clock working on things that aren't emergencies.\"\nMacy's intention to turn its Twenty Ninth Street store into office space accelerated growing concerns about opportunity zones, though the retailer is not making use of the opportunity zone funding. A site review application was submitted this week, and several representatives for Macy's and mall owner Macerich were among the 30 speakers during an extended public hearing \u2014 and accounted for some of the night's more colorful exchanges.\n\"(The) existence of (the) opportunity zone had nothing to do with Macy's decision to redevelop,\" said Chris Shears, an architect working with the department store. \"(We've been) working on it for a little under two years.\"\nCouncilman Sam Weaver responded by asking Shears if he had read the recently updated comprehensive plan, specifically, its goals to preserve retail, increase housing and curb office space."}

Once again, we are experiencing the special joy that comes with our academic vocation when we congratulate our new graduates and welcome our freshmen and returning seniors. It's a wonderful but mixed feeling when we look at the faces of these young women and men: they have a whole life ahead of them, and we are making the most of the time that we have.\nThis has also been a busy year for Singaporeans, as we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of our Independence. Quite naturally, this has stirred thoughts about the massive social transformation of the last half-century.\nBut I wonder if our thinking can be deepened by stretching the timeframe back by a couple of decades. 2015 also marks 70 years after the end of the Asia-Pacific War - one of the epochal events of the 20th century.\nToday, it's hard to imagine how the young women and men of South-east Asia at mid-century could have yearned and struggled for freedom from colonialism without experiencing the trauma of the war.\nBut, equally, it's hard to understand why the majority of Japanese supported - or did not oppose - the \"holy war\" waged by their country against fellow Asians. These included the ordinary men who committed extraordinary acts of killing or caused the suffering of millions under orders from their commanders, and in the name of the Emperor.\nI had been meaning to write because hardly a week passes this year without some reference to the war, especially to the question of what constitutes a proper apology on the part of the Japanese government.\nThe issue has surfaced persistently in recent decades. But there are now new nationalist urges across Asia, with a rising China and geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea. Japan has been grappling with its post-war national identity for years, and the present government is determined to revise its pacifist Constitution.\nBy definition, a nation-state has to be nationalist in one way or another - especially when its leaders perceive it to be vulnerable to internal and external threats. Nationalist sentiments are shored up by portraying an uncertain present and projecting a vision of a more secure future. This also entails specific ways of remembering or forgetting the past. In the Japanese case, this is illustrated by the repeated visits of prime ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours the country's war dead, and by their avoidance of an unqualified apology for wartime atrocities.\nThe celebrations in Singapore will culminate on Aug 9, our National Day. But I am reminded that the same date 70 years ago has another kind of significance in global history: the dropping of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, three days after the US Air Force dropped the first bomb in Hiroshima.\n\"Under a summer sky,\" as Paul Ham put it, \"without warning, hundreds of thousands of civilian men, women and children felt the sun fall on their heads.\" Those fateful seconds - the blinding light, the swelling fireball, the rising mushroom cloud - marked the dawn of the nuclear age, a new age of perpetual insecurity as more countries, big and small, entered the global arms race.\nTo this day, historians have asked whether the bombs should have been dropped at all, and dropped on civilian populations, and whether Nagasaki could have been spared after Hiroshima. The scholarly consensus - although still debated - is that the political decision to use the bomb was made in spite of the military assessment that Japan's surrender was imminent.\nOne insightful analysis"}

{"idx": "8687", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Why fossil fuels need to stay in the ground - a video explainer, by Guardian journalists.\nThe world has much more coal, oil and gas in the ground than it can safely burn. That much is physics.\nAnyone studying the question with an open mind will almost certainly come to a similar conclusion: if we and our children are to have a reasonable chance of living stable and secure lives 30 or so years from now, according to one recent study 80% of the known coal reserves will have to stay underground, along with half the gas and a third of the oil reserves.\nIf only science were enough.\nIf not science, then politics? MPs, presidents, prime ministers and members of congress are always telling us (often suggesting a surrender of civil liberties in return) that their first duty is the protection of the public.\nBut politics sometimes struggles with physics. Science is, at its best, long term and gives the best possible projection of future risk. Which is not always how politics works, even when it comes to our security. Politicians prefer certainty and find it difficult to make serious prudent planning on high probabilities.\nOn climate change, the public clamour is in inverse proportion to the enormity of the long-term threat. If only it were the other way round. And so, year after year, the people who represent us around the UN negotiating tables have moved inches, not miles.\nWhen, as Guardian colleagues, we first started discussing this climate change series, there were advocates for focusing the main attention on governments. States own much of the fossil fuels that can never be allowed to be dug up. Only states, it was argued, can forge the treaties that count. In the end the politicians will have to save us through regulation \u2013 either by limiting the amount of stuff that is extracted, or else by taxing, pricing and limiting the carbon that\u2019s burned.\nIf journalism has so far failed to animate the public to exert sufficient pressure on politics through reporting and analysis, it seemed doubtful whether many people would be motivated by the idea of campaigning for a paragraph to be inserted into the negotiating text at the UN climate talks in Paris this December. So we turned to an area where campaigners have recently begun to have marked successes: divestment.\nThere are two arguments in favour of moving money out of the biggest and most aggressive fossil fuel companies \u2013 one moral, the other financial.\nThe moral crusaders \u2013 among them Archbishop Desmond Tutu \u2013 see divestment from fossil fuels in much the same light as earlier campaigners saw the push to pull money out of tobacco, arms, apartheid South Africa \u2013 or even slavery. Most fossil fuel companies, they argue, have little concern for future generations. Of course, the companies are run by sentient men and women with children and grandchildren of their own. But the market pressures and fiduciary duties involved in running public companies compel behaviour that is overwhelmingly driven by short-term returns.\nSo \u2013 the argument goes \u2013 the directors will meanwhile carry on business as usual, no matter how incredible it may seem that they will be allowed to dig up all the climate-warming assets they own. And, by and large \u2013 and discounting recent drops in the price of oil \u2013 they continue to be reasonably good short-term businesses, benefiting from enormous subsidies as they search for even more reserves that can never be used.\nWhat is fossil fuel divestment and why does it matter?\nThe pragmatists argue the case on different grounds. It is simply this: that finance will eventually have to surrender to physics.\nIf \u2013 eventually \u2013 the companies cannot, for the sake of the human race"}
{"idx": "8688", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Over the last 14 years, my journey of being the mom of a troubled daughter has been like running a race, but this race is not a sprint, it's a marathon. It's a long-distance endurance run. My goal was and still is, to not quit, but to make it to the end (whatever that may be) with my faith intact in spite of her struggles with alcohol, drugs, self-harm, mental illness and suicide attempts.\nSome days I feel like I hit a wall, a place where I'm tempted to give up. All I want is for this to be over. I need rest and a victorious resolution. I want the pain to end, don't you?\nI've heard when you run a marathon, you need to prepare yourself for a similar place, a breaking point, where you want to quit.\nAn experienced marathoner once told me, \"This tends to happen around the 20th mile. Your body tries to convince you you're done. You've got nothing left. All your reserves are depleted. Your confidence is shot. Your strength is gone. There's no more stamina or endurance left in your physical tank. Your chest burns, and your muscles are on fire. Your brain tells you that you couldn't possibly take one more step. Not one. Everything in you screams, 'I can't go any farther!'\"\nHave you felt this way? I have.\nIn the Boston Marathon, this breaking point is known as Heartbreak Hill. These last six miles are a series of hills that steadily climb higher and higher. The streets are lined with fans and observers who cheer the runners on. They need all the encouragement they can get. Maybe the end of the race is designed this way to weed out the weak, forcing them to drop out and fall by the wayside, literally. Sounds cruel.\nTo keep going and finish the race feels impossible. This is where the athlete's advance preparation and training kick in.\nAn article I read explained that the marathoner can't look too far ahead or back. To do so makes finishing much more difficult. They'll never make it to the finish line if they do that. They must focus all their attention on the next step, and the next, and the next, while voicing positive affirmations to themselves. You can do this. Don't give up. You're almost there. Just keep going. This will be worth all the effort in the end. Soon you can rest.\nStay in the present, on getting through today. Don't look back and regret the past or too far ahead and worry.\nFocus on Jesus, the author of our faith. Keep our thoughts on who He is and what He's done for us.\nFill our minds with positive affirmations from the truth of God's Word. Read and study the Bible. Spend time in prayer. Worship and fellowship with other believers. Educate yourself on your child's issues and find a supportive community who will cheer you on in the hard times.\nIn our parenting marathon, crossing the finish line with our faith intact means we win, even if our prayers are never answered for our children. We can survive and be OK. We can still live our lives, find purpose from our pain and let God use it for good.\nWhat about you? Have you reached your Heartbreak Hill? Which one of these strategies will you try?\nDear, exhausted mom or dad, when you grow weary, please don't give up. When your child's situation looks bleak and you think you can't take one more step, take heart, take one day at a time"}
{"idx": "8689", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Quaid-e-Azam\u2019s care, consideration and counseling for children, especially for the youth, knew no bounds. There is one enlightening story after another how he advised, counseled, groomed and rejuvenated the young nation during Pakistan Movement and for the future.\nOnce, in April, 1945, Quaid-e-Azam visited a school in Qalat, Baluchistan with his host, Khan of Qalat. As a little boy shook hands with him, the Quaid pointed towards the Khan of Qalat and asked this boy as to he was. The boy replied, \u201cOur king.\u201d Next Quaid-e-Azam inquired with the little boy about himself and asked whether the boy knew him. The boy answered, \u201cyou are our King\u2019s guest.\u201d Finally, the Quaid asked the boy to introduce himself. The boy said, \u201cI am a Baloch.\u201d At this point the Quaid gestured towards the Khan of Qalat and earnestly requested him to tell children that they were first Muslims and later the rest of the identities.\nAmong Muslim League\u2019s monumental problems at the threshold of independence was scarcity of resources as the young nation was all set to embark on the road to development. It was at a Muslim League crucial meeting at the Sindh Government House Karachi, attended by Ghulam Hussain Hiddayat, Chief Minister of Sindh and Shaheed Soharwardi, that the Quaid advised the young nation to practice austerity, economize resources and believe in the magical principle of self-help, self-reliance and self-actualization.\nThe importance Quaid-e-Azam attached to the youth and the inspiration he provided them need no introduction. When, in 1941, Raja Ghazanfar Ali, Quaid\u2019s close aid and admirer and Sir Sikandar Hayyat, Chief Minister of Punjab, desired to meet the Quaid, who was then attending the annual congregation of Muslims Students Federation in Lahore, the Quaid politely refused to give them appointments and requested them to check for his schedule with the office bearers of the Muslims Students Federation who were coordinating all his appointments during this period.\nQuaid-e-Azam always regarded children as the future of the nation. He had always pinned high hopes in the future architects of the nation. The most inspiring part of the Quaid\u2019s guidance to the youth was that he himself chaired their meetings and was thoroughly involved in their guidance and grooming. He was so confident about the youth\u2019s potential that in 1937 he himself organized the All-India Muslim Students Youth Federation. The same year he presided and addressed its first meeting in Calcutta and said that youth was the cornerstone of Pakistan Movement, the nation has many Jinnahs in the making and our future is secured with the future generations.\nQuaid-e-Azam\u2019s feelings for and image of the youth can be gauged from many a statement he made about the young nation. For example, he termed youth as ambassadors of the nation at Aligarh, acknowledged as the centre of Pakistan Movement and honored youth as magazine of the nation at a Patna\u2019s Muslim League congregation, believed in youth as the pillar of strength for the nation at so many places and so on. However, he prioritized for the youth the need for national character, respect for law, devotion to studies, spirit of self-reliance and the motto of unity, faith and discipline that resulted in the dream-come-true reality of Pakistan and where lies the saliv"}

Venezuela's product shortages have since worsened, creating further incentives to buy goods in Colombia and bring them back.\nA plunge in global oil prices have left the OPEC nation's government unable to maintain lavish subsidies created during the rule of late President Hugo Chavez, while currency controls have left businesses struggling to obtain raw materials and machine parts.\nVenezuelans routinely spend hours in lines at home seeking items ranging from corn flour to cancer medication to auto parts.

He stood out with his solid physique, and soft intense face. However, the moment he spoke, his struggles became obvious.\nWhile talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, \"UHH...UHH,\" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem. He had enrolled in my speech class to hopefully be able to speak better. As he spoke to me a couple of kids in line elbowed each other in the side while softly giggling. When the classes started they began to laugh at him as he tried to express himself.\nThe students jumped as my fist slammed down hard on the desk. \"First of all, you are all supposed to be Christian kids. Is laughing and mocking someone who has difficulty a proper model of Jesus you are all supposed to emulate? I am ashamed of all of you!\"\nThis was the first day of the semester. The students suddenly became silent and attentive. \"First of all, don't you EVER mock or laugh at someone who has a handicap of ANY kind, or ANYONE who is differant. As a Christian you are supposed to encourage everyone you meet, especially those with difficulties. You are to respect EVERYBODY. Is that clear?\" They all soberly nodded their heads.\nThen I added, \"Trevor shows more courage than ANY of you. Knowing his problem was abnormal he was determined to enroll in this class, in an effort to conquer his speech defect and to eventually stand up and give a speech. All of you can learn a lot from this very brave young man. Now don't forget for one moment what I have just said.\"\nThings went well from that point. Trevor told me that he wanted to study to become a doctor. I told him that as a doctor he would have to speak publicly from time to time so he was in the right class. I would find and purchase a book on human anatomy to give to him with encouragement. I spent a lot of my own time with him during that semester.\nOne day I called his father, David, to tell him that I wanted him to bring Trevor over to our TV studio where the church produced several programs. Trevor knew what was up, his father did not. During the broadcast I told the TV audience that some of my students have a presentation and then introduced Trevor. His father looked puzzled. The young man came onto the set with poise, confidence and gave his entire presentation without one stutter. His father was amazed at what my speech class had accomplished for his son.\nAfter his graduation from Trinity, his father put him into a public high school. I heard nothing from Trevor during the years to follow. I did see his father in church a couple of years later and he told me that his son was doing great in high school, and was on the football team. He was beaming with pride and extended again his appreciation for what I had done for Trevor.\nThis is Trevor Dunning whom you taught speech to at Trinity Christian.

{"idx": "8703", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Aug. 8, 2018, 1:20 a.m.\nIf you're already using a password manager, bravo! Ready to try a new app? Switching isn't as hard as you might think. Just follow these simple steps.\nWe constantly review the latest password managers as they grow and evolve. Some update frequently, adding features like password inheritance and automated password change. Others can go years without an update. For example, about seven years elapsed between RoboForm version 6 and version 7, and another six to reach the thoroughly up-to-date RoboForm Everywhere version 8. If your password manager is mired in the past, you don't have to be a stick-in-the-mud. Changing to a new password manager isn't a walk in the park, but neither is it impossible. Here are two ways to make the switch from your old, tired password manager to a slick, powerful new one.\nPassword managers are a companionable lot, not like antivirus tools. In most cases, two running at the same time don't fight each other, as antivirus software tends to do. Just install the new one without removing the old one. Each time you visit a secure site, the old password manager fills in your credentials, and the new one slurps them up into its own collection. Simple!\nIf both tools pop up offering to fill your saved credentials, it probably means that you already migrated the site's data to the new password manager. But look closely; it might be that you have more than one login for that site, perhaps home and work emails. In that case, I recommend logging in to transfer each of login for the site, so there's no confusion.\nOf course, you want to get all your passwords transferred, not just the ones you've used recently. One way to track progress is to delete each transferred password from the old utility. Another is to add a tag to those you've transferred (if the old password manager supports that functionality), or move them to a Finished folder.\nEventually, though, you'll have to power through the remaining passwords, the sites that you haven't yet visited during this migration. Most password managers have some kind of master list of passwords. Step through the list, launch each one, capture it in the new password manager, and tag or delete the old one. Repeat until finished. The beauty of doing it this way is that it weeds out sites that no longer exist, and sites where your password isn't valid. Don't care about the site? Just delete it without transferring.\nA few years ago, I used this technique to migrate from LastPass Premium to Dashlane. It took a while, but it was worth the trouble.\nIf your old password manager doesn't have an export function, or the new one can't import, the technique just discussed is your only option. But if the features align, you may be able to switch over in a jiffy. Just don't expect perfection.\nSmart developers make sure their products can import from as many competitors as possible. LogMeOnce Password Management Suite Ultimate, for example, can import from almost 20 competitors. The list of import options for LastPass contains more than 30 products, but a closer look reveals that only a third of those are really relevant. Some of the rest are defunct, and others come from individuals rather than companies. Of the products I've reviewed, more can import from Dashlane, LastPass, and RoboForm Everywhere than from any others.\nThere's a good chance that your old password manager won't be on"}

The information was then delivered to the FBI field office in Sacramento that set up the sting, the memorandum said.\nAccording to the memorandum, Martin, who at the time was retired and living in New York, flew to California in October 2014 and met with a government operative at a hotel in Palo Alto. He met again with the operative and another California-based informant three months later in New York.\nIn September 2015, Polaris wired $100,000 to a bank account set up by the FBI, the memorandum said, and on Dec. 1, 2015, FBI agents questioned Martin in San Francisco and arrested him on suspicion to lying to them about whether he agreed to pay the commander the money.\n\u201cI am very sorry I was involved in this business, because I believed in people,\u201d Martin said, his voice occasionally breaking.\n\u201cI should have said no,\u201d Martin said.\nHis lawyer, Malcolm Segal, said Martin suffers from a heart condition and also battled cancer into remission.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have a shortened life expectancy,\u201d Segal said.\nMartin\u2019s involvement in the case was only \u201chappenstance,\u201d Segal said. He asked the judge to only sentence his client to 41 months. Prosecutors had sought a minimum of 15 years and eight months.\nMartin\u2019s brother, Gheorge, was the one who set the bribery into motion, according to the lawyer. Gheorge Martin, who apparently never left Romania, was not arrested or charged in the case, leaving his brother to try and make the deal with the Travis commander.\n\u201cHe was in from the beginning,\u201d Beckwith said in court.\nThree other co-conspirators pleaded guilty in the month before last year\u2019s trial. Anamaria Cruceru, Constantin Schiller and Marcelle Bananga are each scheduled to be sentenced by Nunley on May 11.

The values of major cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple skyrocketed so high that those who had invested in them earlier felt on top of the world and those who hadn\u2019t felt that they had missed out. On December 17, 2017, the value of Bitcoin had risen to an all-time high ($19,850) as had several other major cryptocurrencies.\nSeveral warnings were given as to why people should avoid investing in cryptocurrencies on the premise of the volatile nature of the market.\nHowever, 2018 has not been a good year for the market so far. Having reached a valuation of $834 billion as of January 7, 2018, CoinMarketCap reported that the market witnessed a drastic plunge of about 66%, losing over $553 billion. Bitcoin recorded a huge loss of over 50% in February, with valuation dropping below $7,000. Ethereum and Ripple also suffered similar drops, both recording losses of over 40% during the same month. This plunge has put many into a state of panic. Could this be where the bubble bursts? Is this what so many experts have warned about? Are we seeing the end of crypto-currencies?\n\u201cThe market before was clearly overheated,\" points out Miko Matsumura, cofounder of Evercoin. \"The only fear in the market was fear of missing out.\u201d These speculations led many to rush into the market, resulting in price inflation. However, he believes that the market is currently stabilizing, which was the reason for the plunge.\n\u201cI do think there are a number of people in a state of panic, which is unfortunate, but for every new person who panics, there are a number of people who are comfortable with 50% drops and more who are either holding or seeing it as a buying opportunity.\u201d Matsumura believes this could also be a window of opportunity for future gains.\nAccording to Dager Contreras, co-founder of Ocular, developments such as blockchain security and compliance will allow investors to feel safe when investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWith the recent hack of Coincheck costing the company $530 million in virtual currency, the fear of security cannot be over-emphasized. The hack is said to be one of the largest in history and sparked raids by the Financial Services Agency in Japan on the exchange. The heist has heightened the need for proper regulatory and security measures in the market.\nNegative press around cryptocurrencies has done little to relieve tensions in the market. In December, The Crypto Company was suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amid concerns about the adequacy and accuracy of information about the company. Speculation about cryptocurrencies being a bubble which could burst at any time has also led to an increase in fear among many.\nAccording to an article from The Guardian, economists had warned that the Bitcoin bubble had burst and worse was to follow. In February 2018, the Bank of Austria reduced the value of Bitcoin to \u201cpure speculation.\u201d Such hard-hitting statements from numerous sources sent cryptocurrency investors -- especially the new ones -- into a frenzy, which is believed to have contributed to the downturn.\nMoreover, Chinese authorities have recently banned ICOs in the country and will block citizens from accessing websites that offer ICOs"}

{"idx": "8709", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: What Are Tax-Deferred Annuity Taxation Rules?\nAnnuities have unusual tax characteristics, but they come with some pitfalls as well.\nMany investors use annuities as part of their overall financial planning, and these insurance-company products come with some interesting tax benefits. However, along with those benefits, you also have to keep in mind some rules you have to follow that can lead to some unexpected surprises if you're not aware of them. Let's look more closely at how annuities get taxed.\nAnnuity contracts offer no up-front tax break when you first buy the annuity. Some annuities are available for purchase within IRAs or qualified plans like 401(k) accounts, but in those cases, it's the plan contribution that gives you the tax break, not the purchase of the annuity in particular.\nOnce the money is in the annuity, though, it gets the same tax deferral that IRA and 401(k) money gets. You don't have to worry about paying tax on the income the annuity generates, and you can make exchanges between different annuities without realizing any capital gains tax on the appreciation in the contract.\nWhen you take money out of an annuity, how it gets taxed depends on where it is. If you take money out of an annuity that you hold within an IRA and have your financial institution pay it to you, then the distribution will get taxed like an IRA distribution. Typically, that means you'll pay income tax on the entire thing.\nIf you hold an annuity outside an IRA or qualified plan, then you'll get tax credit for your contributions. However, the IRS imposes a last-in, first-out method, which means that you'll have to pay income tax on all your profits first before you can get tax-free treatment for your initial contributions.\nIn addition, the IRS treats annuities like retirement accounts for purposes of imposing early withdrawal penalties. If you take money out of an annuity before you reach age 59 1/2 and you don't qualify for one of the exemptions, then you'll have to pay an additional 10% penalty on the amount you take out.\nIf you die before taking money out of your annuity, the person you name as beneficiary will have the rights to the proceeds. Those payouts are still subject to tax on the deferred income of the annuity, and if the death benefit is higher than the account balance, that increase is also subject to income tax on the heir's tax return.\nAnnuities can be useful as retirement savings vehicles, but they don't have all the benefits that IRAs and 401(k)s do. Make sure you understand all the pros and cons before you buy an annuity."}

Now 12 months have gone by, and it\u2019s clear our debunking was correct.\nThe outlet even asserted that the couple was hoping the baby would be a girl, while their son Silas supposedly had his heart set on a little brother. And to make it easier on the allegedly expectant Biel, the ill-informed \u201csource\u201d maintained Timberlake had \u201cagreed to take a hiatus\u201d from his career. Gossip Cop, however, was assured on the condition of anonymity that the claims were \u201cnot true,\u201d and time has proven the article was indeed wrong on all counts: Biel was not pregnant and Timberlake never put his career on hold.\nFor starters, if the couple really did have a baby on the way, the birth would\u2019ve happened three months ago. Obviously, that never took place because Biel was not with child. She also would\u2019ve had an unmissable baby bump as 2017 worn down. Yet this photo of Biel wearing a see-through outfit last November shows she was as thin as ever.\nAs for Timberlake, as opposed to putting his career on the backburner, that October it was confirmed he\u2019d perform at the 2018 Super Bowl Halftime Show. Then, Timberlake ended up releasing his fifth album, Man Of The Woods, in early February, just two days before the big gig. And last month, Timberlake embarked on a headlining tour to support the record.\nNeither he nor his wife are at home taking care of an infant. In fact, she\u2019s been joining Timberlake on the road. Olympian Aly Raisman posted a photo to Twitter on Thursday, showing her posing with the singer and Biel backstage at Wednesday\u2019s concert in Boston. So not only has Timberlake not taken a \u201chiatus,\u201d but Biel is accompanying him during this next phase of his career. There\u2019s even tour dates already scheduled through January of 2019.\nAdditionally, in a video released on YouTube this week, Biel and Timberlake reflect on their parenthood journey with their former nanny, and nothing is mentioned about having a second child. Of course, that\u2019s not to say the couple won\u2019t ever give Silas a sibling and that Biel won\u2019t possibly be pregnant again one day.

The proposal calls for raising base tuition to $7,270 at the University of Iowa and $7,240 at both Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa.\nIowa students can plan on the 2 percent increase for 2017-18 regardless of how much higher education money gets allocated during the upcoming legislative session, said Bruce Rastetter, president of the board that oversees Iowa's public universities.\n\"The two-year budget and tuition model that was developed by this board this summer and passed by the board in September ... allows for this critical predictability for planning and for students and their families,\" Rastetter said.\nThe plan's proposed 2 percent increase for the 2018-19 academic year, however, would depend on whether the Iowa Legislature provides an additional 2 percent in state funding to the regent system next year.\nThe vote took place during the regents' meeting in Cedar Falls.\nGov.

But how do you figure out the specific number of calories you're supposed to eat in a day, and how do you translate all your meals and snacks into that number? It can feel a little daunting, but Stephanie Ferrari, a registered dietitian with Fresh Communications, tells POPSUGAR, \"There are a few tricks of the trade that you can use to make calorie counting less tedious.\"\n\"The first step is to calculate your individual caloric needs,\" she said. \"Caloric needs are based on numerous factors, but the most important ones for a healthy individual include gender, age, weight, height, and activity level.\" Many years ago, you used to have to \"bust out the pen and paper and do the math using an equation, but thanks to the internet, there are countless online calorie calculators to figure it out for you! Stephanie says, \"I like the one that HealthLine offers.\"\nStephanie says even though you want to lose weight fast, be careful about cutting out too many calories in the beginning. It will leave you feeling hangry and deprived, which will just cause overeating.\nThis is a common reason many people who want to lose weight end up being unsuccessful. Stephanie reminds you to think of losing weight as a long-term goal. She adds, \"It doesn't happen overnight or even over one month. My advice is to pick a healthy, attainable time frame for losing weight and cutting calories.\"\nFor example, let's say you want to lose 10 pounds. Stephanie says, \"Doing so over five months is an appropriate goal and will require a two-pound weight loss per month (or half a pound per week). One pound is equal to 3,500 calories, so for this goal, you'll need a caloric deficit of 7,000 per month, or 1,750 per week, or 250 per day.\" That seems doable, right?\n\"Take your daily caloric needs, subtract it by 250, and you'll have your goal caloric intake for a 10-pound weight loss over five months,\" she says. Here's an example: an average healthy woman has a daily caloric need of 2,000 calories. In order to lose 10 pounds in five months, she'll need to eat 1,750 calories per day.\nObviously your activity level needs to be taken into account and how fast you want to lose the weight, so use a calorie calculator to figure out the exact number for you. Once you do, here are few tips for counting calories.\nStephanie suggests, \"Decide how you want to spread your calories over the course of the day. Budget calories for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks. For example, if you have 1,750 calories to eat per day, you may choose to eat 480 calories per meal and have each snack be 150 calories.\"\nUse Sunday as your day to meal plan. Create a list of meals for each day of the week that fits those caloric budgets. \"For breakfast, for example, you might eat two hard-boiled eggs, one medium slice of whole wheat bread, a tablespoon of peanut butter, a cup of blueberries, one small apple, and a cup of black coffee (484 calories).\" Eating the same few meals for breakfast and lunch (such as mason jar salads) will save time since you only have to figure it out once!\nThe bonus with planning"}

Agree with Sue and Pat.\nI think this was another trump plot. Kennedy showed his true colors, but I think trump bought this seat, I hope it becomes part of Mueller's extended investigation, or another special counsel. I still hold faith the Mueller investigation will find the 2016 won by fraud and that it will be overturned. Yes, naive, but it's one of my better qualities. If that happens, and there is precedent, then everything Trump has done will be invalidated, or should be, every appointment, executive order, all of it wiped away.\nThere's bright hope for the future in people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose platform is the most progressive I have ever seen while still being absolutely possible with some much needed budgetary reform. We CAN afford it, easily, it will come even if takes my generation's dying off to make it happen. This is the platform this newest generation and the one following it can, and will, get behind.

It\u2019s now being used by artists, builders, home owners, everyone in between, entire companies ... and cities.\n>GitHub is doing to open source what the internet did to the publishing industry.\n\"Anyone can now change the data when new bike paths are built, when roads are under construction, and new buildings are erected,\u201d the city of Chicago recently announced. People are managing home-renovation projects on GitHub. One law firm also just announced a couple days ago that it\u2019s posting legal documents for early-stage startup funding on GitHub. Someone even published all of the laws in Germany on GitHub last year. (Perhaps not so surprisingly, he has about 17 open \u201cpull\u201d requests for changes.) And of course, GitHub is still used by programmers and developers flying AR Drones with Node.js or building websites with jQuery.\nAs people who were once just users become producers, they\u2019re re-shaping the culture of open source. GitHub, I believe, is doing to open source what the internet did to the publishing industry: It\u2019s creating a culture gap between the previous, big-project generation of open source and a newer, more amateurized generation of open source today.\nWhen most people hear \"open\" source, they think democratic, distributed, egalitarian: everyone building things together for everyone else to use.\nBut that hasn\u2019t actually been the case. Most open source software has been created and maintained by a privileged and protected class of people \u2013 professional developers \u2013 who interacted with other developers that were a lot like them (though were just different enough to have a good argument with).\nMikeal is the CTO of Getable and the curator of NodeConf. Roger's long history in open source includes the Open Source Applications Foundation, Mozilla, CouchOne, and numerous projects across different communities.\nBefore GitHub, I spent a lot of my time thinking and talking about how to best manage open source projects because the coordination cost of an open source project was significant. So significant, in fact, that when a project did well and grew a big enough community, it made more sense for the project to grow rather than fracture into smaller projects. But the bigger and more complex a software project got, the harder it became to contribute. So an assortment of members \u2013 or \u201ccommitters\u201d \u2013 were tasked with managing and producing the project. This often led to rifts between those producing and those consuming a project.\nGitHub closed this rift by making open source much more decentralized. It became less about the project and more about the individuals.\nThe workflow for using GitHub is very personal. A person (I\u2019m github.com/mikeal) has an account, and everything they publish exists one level below them. If someone else wants to fix something, they \"fork\" it, which puts a copy of it under them.\nThis workflow is very empowering: It encourages individuals to fix things and own those fixes just as much as they own the projects they start. It also gives all users an identity in the new open source culture; GitHub is actually the number-one identity provider for peer-based production over the internet in more than just code.\nI've been contributing to open source projects for over 10 years, but what\u2019s different now is that I'm not a \u201cmember\u201d of these projects \u2013 I'm just a \u201cuser,\u201d and contributing a little is a part of being a user.

But with too little in the way of soundscapes and too much when it comes to everyone's favorite new toy, the Auto-Tune, it largely fizzles when it should pop.\nUnfortunately, that ambition is almost completely wasted on \"808s & Heartbreaks.\" In places where it has the potential to be interesting, the album seems to fall flat on its face, and the more-traditionally hip-hop moments are just sort of all right in terms of Kanye's past production quality.\nCase in point: the opener, \u201cSay You Will,\u201d which starts with a tom-tom paired up alongside a few digital bleeps\u2026 and stays that way for the next 6:18. A driving piano melody provides the backbone for \u201cWelcome to Heartbreak,\u201d but the part that SHOULD be driving it, the BEAT, has had all the treble removed and is playing the background.\nModern rap fans will probably begin the hating here by attacking my well-documented fondness for classic boom-bap, mid-\u201890s-era hip-hop, and by all means, hate away. But that\u2019s not it. I understand the concept for the record, it\u2019s right there in the title: a juxtaposition of the intricacies of modern relationships with the simplistic sounds of the 808, which defined another of hip-hop\u2019s classic eras.\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that too many of the songs here seem overly, intentionally simplistic, like \u2018Ye is trying to drive the metaphor home with a sledgehammer and, unfortunately, it makes for a lot of sluggish songs during the course of \"808\u2019s\" 52 minutes (relatively short for a Kanye album).\nThe most mystifying part about all this is his album-long penchant for everybody's new favorite musical toy, the Auto-Tune. Now, someone like Lil\u2019 Wayne, who has no discernible singing talent? I understand why HE would want to Auto-Tune himself into submission. But it just doesn\u2019t make sense here, particularly given that Kanye\u2019s actually got a pretty good singing voice (the several times he sings sans digital assistance, he sounds just fine).\nBut on \"808s,\" with its already-spare soundscapes, his voice plays front and center, and all of the manipulation gives things a weird, plasticized feeling. That leaves mainly the lyrics, and it's hard to turn a clever, punchy phrase as an R&B robot. The songs cover fairly generic love/hate/make-ups-to-break-ups, which in turn throws the spotlight back on the production, that at times sounds almost like an unfinished version of a regular mid-tempo Kanye song.\nBut even the Kanye West Mid-Tempo Jam has taken on a lot more character in the past. Not so much here.\nI\u2019m not totally down on it, though: \u201cHeartless\u201d works a bouncy flute loop and Kanye actually sings, sounding just fine; \u201cAmazing\u201d replaces Southern bounce with a heavy piano and organic percussion, providing a nice bedrock for Young Jeezy\u2019s guest verse, and \u201cParanoid\u201d is an modern uptempo take on \u201880s synth gl"}

Ravi Belagere, who brings out 'Hai Bangalore', was arrested yesterday from his house here on charges of hiring a 'supari' killer from Vijayapura in north Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli.\n\"No one has filed an FIR in this case based on a complaint filed by someone. It is a suo-motu case by the police based on Shahi's (the contract killer) statement. There is no meaning in it,\" Bhavana claimed. \"I'm very confident, he (Belagere) is not guilty. He has not done anything and will be out of it safely very soon,\" she told reporters in Dharwad. Bhavana said that she has been advised by lawyers not to issue statements on the case and that the evidence, the police have is just a statement and the case cannot stand based on it.\n\"My dad is a great man, he is a fighter, he will come out fighting,\" she added. Belagere was produced before a magistrate at his residence last night and was remanded in four days police custody. The police stumbled on the alleged plot when the contract killer, Shashidhar Mundewadi, was being questioned in connection with the probe into the killing of senior journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead at her house by unidentified assailants here on September 5. Official sources said that the City Crime Branch was questioning Belagere.\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah, commenting on the case, said that the police would do their work according to the law. \"I don't know. Police might have evidence, they will work according to the law,\" he said. Yesterday, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Satish Kumar claimed that Mundewadi had stated during interrogation that Belagere gave him 'supari' to kill Heggaravalli Based on the inputs, Belagare was arrested and a pistol and a double barrel gun was seized from him, he had said. Kumar also said that Belagere wanted to kill Heggaravalli for \"personal reasons\" and that an FIR was registered at the Subrahmanyapura police station.\nBelagere was in news after the Karnataka Legislative Assembly passed a resolution sentencing him and Anil Raju, editor of tabloid 'Yelahanka Voice', to one year in jail. Fines of Rs 10,000 each was also imposed on them for their alleged defamatory articles against state legislators.

Now those worries are back, with the twist that the tongue-wagging is concentrated on the FAANG names \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet, high-fliers that have led growth stocks to a decade of whipping value's performance.\nBut there's a smarter way to do value than just looking for cheap stocks, say experts led by Bill Miller, the unorthodox value investor whose 15-year streak (through 2005) of beating the Standard & Poor's 500 index is still a benchmark no active manager can touch.\nThe key is to avoid the mistake of thinking \"value\" means nothing more than a low stock price. Now running his own fund after decades at Legg Mason Value Trust, Miller's focus was \u2014 and is \u2014 on finding companies focused on high returns on invested capital and free-cash-flow growth, as well as large market opportunities. That helps small and large investors alike distinguish stocks that are undervalued from those that are simply cheap.\nTwenty years ago that led Miller to Amazon, the first of the FANG stocks, excluding Apple, to go public. Along with early internet leaders, like America Online and Yahoo, Amazon helped Miller update what it meant to do value. And having just scooped up a 30 percent return by adding Facebook shares during the brouhaha over sharing of customers' data last winter, he argues that those tactics remain smart.\nTo be sure, data assembled for CNBC.com by Morningstar shows little move into growth stocks by value funds, at least major ones. There are no reliable aggregate numbers for value funds holding growth stocks, but examinations of the largest value funds don't show a pattern of widening their mandate to chase growth, Morningstar senior analyst Greg Carlson said.\nCarlson checked the 20 largest buyers of each of the FAANG stocks, and no value fund was a top buyer of Amazon or Netflix between the the fund's two most recent reports. Amazon and Netflix are the two most expensive of the FAANG companies, as measured by price-to-earnings multiples, making them the least suitable for value funds by many traditional metrics. No large value fund counted either Amazon or Netflix among its top 20 holdings either, Carlson said.\nThe only \"value\" fund among Facebook's top 20 new buyers was Bill Nygren's $19.4 billion Oakmark Fund, which took the stake in the first quarter of this year. A related Oakmark fund also added a big position in Alphabet this year, while the flagship Oakmark Fund has 3 percent of its $19.4 billion fund in Google's parent. Vanguard Wellington, an allocation fund that blends value stocks with a bond portfolio, is the only other top value-oriented fund that owns Alphabet, and it has had its position since 2014, Carlson said.\n\"Also, Oakmark Fund is in Morningstar'"}

The competition offers more features, but slower printing or lower-quality prints.\nThe Lexmark C500n is a basic, single-function color laser printer geared for small offices and home offices. After reviewing a bunch of multifunction color printers recently, $400 seems like a lot for a single-function machine. The C500n's fast print speeds and network-readiness, however, make it a good addition for small offices that have high-volume text printing needs. Although, for about the same price, the Samsung CLP-510n offers a duplexer, and the Konica Minolta Magicolor 2430DL serves up a PictBridge port. If you have the budget, a color laser multifunction is a cash- and space-efficient option; it saves you from having to purchase separate devices, then find room for them. At $899, the HP Color LaserJet 2840 is more than twice the price of the Lexmark C500n, but it includes fax, copier, and scanner functions--useful in any office environment. If you're happy with the functions of the C500n but just want a speedier option, check out Lexmark's own C522n, which printed color text and graphics at about twice the speed of the C500n and has more expandability options, too.\nLike all laser printers, the Lexmark C500n is a monolithic piece of machinery; make sure you have room for it. It stands 18.9 inches wide, 16.5 inches deep, and 15.2 inches tall and weighs a back-breaking 66 pounds. Unfortunately, it has no built-in hand wells, so moving it is a slow and painstaking task. You're better off getting someone else to help you move it. The standard version of the printer comes with a single 250-sheet input tray; you can purchase an optional 530-page drawer to increase your total input to 780 pages. Additionally, the above-mentioned trays can handle up to A4-size paper only, but Lexmark also sells a legal-size paper drawer. Maximum output is 250 pages as well, and the output tray has a simple foldout flap to catch longer sheets. There's no straight pass-through on this machine, so be wary of using paper that has a tendency to jam when curled.\nThe C500n is network-ready (wired only), which is a boon in a multiuser environment. Another unexpected benefit to the networkability: the printer is noisy, even while idling, so you may want to stick it in an unpopulated area. Even better, it supports both Mac and Windows PCs. It comes with 64MB of nonexpandable memory and a 200MHz processor. It has no duplexer, so double-sided printing is a manual operation.\nThe entire front wall swings down to expose the four toner cartridges. They're set in a single-pass array, which makes for faster color printing than with the older drum laser printers, which had to make a separate pass to lay on each"}

It would help recover and preserve the high-quality habitat for endangered species like bull trout, grizzly bear, and lynx, as well as other iconic species like elk, moose, and bighorn sheep.\nIt would help to battle climate heating by keeping our forests intact rather than logging them, which has been shown to release tremendous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.\nNREPA protects the quality of life attributes that depend on the three Ws \u2014 wildlife, watersheds, and wildlands \u2014 that are foundational to the new creative and amenity-based economy of the region. And it saves taxpayers funds from being wasted on money-losing timber sales (nearly all logging on federal lands costs more to administer than the government receives in payment for the timber).

Mark couldn\u2019t have been sweeter about his recently undertaken mission to track down uses of Jane\u2019s work, in hopes of receiving due mention for his late mother\u2019s classy work (there\u2019s a ton of it \u2013 most without proper attribution \u2013 all over the web). I initially assumed he was looking for money. Aren\u2019t we all, in some respect. And knowing so little about digital rights for protected/unprotected art, I assumed there would be a price to pay (sorry, PI). Alas, that wasn\u2019t his pursuit at all. In fact, Mark is that rare individual who was really trying to spread the word about all the other art out there produced and available in his family\u2019s photographic archive. To quote from a later email, wherein he described late mother.\nJane Burton (1933-2007) had a lifelong love of animals. She trained as an artist and started by illustrating books and magazines with lifelike drawings of animals. She later traveled with her husband to many parts of the world photographing wildlife. At this time she also made several wildlife films for television. Around 30 years ago she began photographing domestic animals, especially cats, and now has a world reputation as a cat photographer. Jane always took immense care to ensure that her subjects were thoroughly acclimatised to the studio environment before beginning a photography session. As a consequence, her photographs, almost without exception, show animals that are happy and behaving normally.\nMark and I bounced a few emails. He related that he\u2019d lived and worked in British Columbia for about a year, and that he \u201cparticularly love(s) Mt. Baker and used to visit it on a weekly basis.\u201d He\u2019s been to Seattle (it rained). I asked how he felt about England\u2019s World Cup performance (\u201cPissed!\u201d). I\u2019d even planned to do a bit of research on digital rights and produce a right proper piece on the matter. But it\u2019s summertime, no matter what the weather outside today would lead us to claim, and other tasks have my attention. Still, my promise to Mark was to mention where to find his family\u2019s work.\nSo, please, if you go in for that sort of thing and have needs for the use of art that features animals in something other than the still lovable Lolcats style, these folks deserve your consideration. Or just send Mark and his family a shout out saying that you appreciate what Jane Burton did as a photographer.\nFollow me on Twitter @ emaggie."}

Apple has gained 67 percent this year.\nA California court on Friday ruled that Samsung, based in South Korea, must pay more than $1.05 billion in damages in the first lawsuit between the dominant global smart-phone rivals to go before a U.S. jury.\nA judge scheduled a hearing next month to consider Apple\ufffds request for a permanent U.S. sales ban on devices such as the Galaxy S and S II smart phones and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 computer. A ban could undermine Samsung\ufffds grip on a smart-phone market valued at $219.1 billion by Bloomberg Industries and set a precedent for rival handset makers that use Google Inc.\ufffds Android operating system.\nThe court victory poses questions for consumers. Will Samsung phones still be available for sale? Will they be more expensive? Will owners of existing phones need to worry?\nThe $1.05 billion in damages was less than the $2.5 billion sought, but still a victory for Apple. Meanwhile, the jury rejected Samsung\ufffds patent-infringement claims against Apple. An appeal is expected.\nQ: Can I still buy a Samsung phone or tablet computer today?\nA: Yes. The jury didn\ufffdt prohibit sales of the devices. However, Apple asked a judge to ban U.S. sales of several Samsung devices. A Sept. 20 hearing has been scheduled. If the judge agrees, that would affect many Samsung devices, but not the most recent ones, such as the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note smart phones. Most of the two dozen devices covered by the lawsuit aren\ufffdt sold in meaningful numbers in the U.S.\nQ: Was Friday\ufffds verdict final?\nA: No. Samsung is challenging it.\nQ: If Apple still prevails, will this drive Samsung out of the phone business?\nA: That\ufffds not likely. The verdict doesn\ufffdt apply outside the United States and doesn\ufffdt apply to the latest Samsung devices, either. The $1 billion in damages represents 1.5 percent of Samsung Electronics Co.\ufffds annual revenue.\nQ: Will this make Samsung phones more expensive?\nA: Possibly. Samsung may have to pay Apple substantial royalties on each phone. Consumers will likely pay for that somehow, but it may not be noticeable in stores. Phone companies such as AT&T and Verizon Wireless already subsidize each smart phone by hundreds of dollars to get retail prices down to $99 or $199.\nQ: What does this mean for the Samsung phone I already own?\nA: This doesn\ufffdt directly affect phones that have already been sold. In the long run, it could reduce enthusiasm around Android, the operating system from Google that Samsung uses.\nQ: What does this mean for other Android phones?\nA: Although the ruling applies only to Samsung, it will have an indirect effect on all makers of Android devices."}

A judicial probe was opened into the case on April 19, with investigators quickly turning their attention to the role played by Gu\u00e9ant, as one of Sarkozy\u2019s closest advisors.\nIn the days that followed, it emerged that the former interior minister received a 500,000 euro wire from a foreign bank account in Malaysia, sparking widespread speculation. Gu\u00e9ant categorically denied the sum was linked in any way to funding from Libya\u2019s former government, claiming instead that it was merely payment for the sale of two paintings by 18th-century Flemish artist Andries van Eertvelt to a foreign lawyer.\n\u201cI repeat that I never saw any trace of Libyan funding going to either an electoral campaign or to anyone in France, and I\u2019ve never heard such a thing mentioned. This money comes from a mundane art deal,\u201d Gu\u00e9ant told French radio RMC in an interview on April 30, insisting he could produce a bill of sale for the transaction.\nSince then, the allegations against Gu\u00e9ant have snowballed as his career comes under increasingly close public scrutiny. His name appeared in headlines again at the end of April when it was revealed that he had given employees cash bonuses to the tune of 20,000-25,000 euros during his time in government. Gu\u00e9ant acknowledged the handouts, explaining in a series of interviews with the media that the practice had been in place long before he took office, and that he and Sarkozy brought an end to it.\nWith the public still reeling from this latest revelation, it then came out that Gu\u00e9ant was embroiled in yet another art-themed scandal. Ivorian newspaper Le Noveau Courrier published an article on May 10 alleging that Gu\u00e9ant had held on to a painting given to him by President Alassane Ouattara in 2011, which he was required to return to the Ivory Coast upon leaving office last year. According to French daily Le Monde, the work is now hanging in Gu\u00e9ant\u2019s law firm, and can be seen in footage of an interview with the former minister filmed at his offices.\nMost recently, however, French media reported on Tuesday that investigators had uncovered another 25,000 euros paid to Gu\u00e9ant\u2019s account from Jordan, once again raising speculation that the sum may be related to the investigation into illegal campaign funding from Libya. The former interior minister has yet to respond publicly to the charges.\nYet Gu\u00e9ant wasn\u2019t always the wheeling-and-dealing, high-powered politician that the French media tend to portray today.

The 10-episode series hails from Girls Trip co-writer Tracy Oliver and Paramount Television.\nThe First Wives Club series, like the film which starred Diane Keaton, Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn, will be based in New York City. It follows three women, Ari, Bree (Buteau) and Hazel (Scott) who band together after their marriages fall apart, and who find strength in their sisterhood- and of course a little revenge.\nScott\u2019s Hazel is a gorgeous music superstar who has faded from the limelight and lost the confidence she once had. She has a raw talent and a killer voice that\u2019s been silenced by her husband/manager Sean for years. When she realizes that he\u2019s been unfaithful in both business and marriage, she is ready to wreak havoc and assert her artistic identity.\nButeau\u2019s Bree is an overwhelmed mom and doctor who hasn\u2019t let loose in years. She is fiercely loyal and committed, so when her husband cheats on her, she is deeply betrayed and not ready to forgive. With the help of Hazel and Ari, she learns to harness her sexual energy and break out of her shell.\nOliver is writing the series and is executive producing along with Karen Rosenfelt (Twilight saga, The Devil Wears Prada) and Scott Rudin, who produced the First Wives Club movie that, in turn, was based on the 1992 novel by Olivia Goldsmith.\nFilming is scheduled to begin in New York City this fall for a 2019 premiere on Paramount Network.\nScott, known for her roles in Tyler Perry\u2019s Why Did I Get Married? and Baggage Claim, also starred in the film Get On Up and was the lead in the BBC/HBO series The No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency. Her 2000 debut album, Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1, went platinum. On TV, Scott most recently recurred on the CW\u2019s Black Lightning. She\u2019s repped by ICM Partners and Maverick Management.\nButeau\u2019s recent TV credits include Broad City and The Tick. On the film side, she recently wrapped production on Isn\u2019t It Romantic and Sell By and currently is shooting comedy Always Be My Maybe for Netflix.

John Pistole' s statment seems to corroborate the FBI's September 2001 Report on the financing of the 9/11 terrorist attacks out of Pakistan, which was made public by ABC News (September 30, 2001.\n2. This September 2001 FBI report was later confirmed by a report of Indian Intelligence (Times of India Oct 9, 2001) which pointed to the role of the (former) head of Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) General Mahmoud Ahmad, who allegedly was instrumental in transferring $100,000 to the 9/11 terrorists.\n3. Ahmad was on an official visit to Washington at the time of the 9/11 attacks and met senior Bush officials, including Colin Powell, Richard Armitage and George Tenet, not to mention the two chairmen of House and Senate select committees on Intelligence Sen Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss.\nThe US authorities sought his [Ahmad] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 were wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the instance of Gen. Mahmoud. Senior government sources have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief. While they did not provide details, they said that Indian inputs, including Sheikh's mobile phone number, helped the FBI in tracing and establishing the link.\n4. At a time when fingers are pointing at Saudi Arabia, John Pistole's statement inevitably raises the issue of \"State sponsorship\" of Al Qaeda by America's puppet regime in Pakistan. This in turn raises the broader issue of the Bush administration's relationship to the terror network.\nA senior official of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has informed US lawmakers that funding for the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States was traced to Pakistan.\nJohn S. Pistole, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counter-terrorism division, told the Senate governmental affairs committee on Thursday afternoon [31 July] , that investigators had \"traced the origin of the funding of the 9/11 attacks back to financial accounts in Pakistan.\"\nHe said high-ranking and well-known Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan \"played a major role in moving the money forward, eventually into the hands of the hijackers located in the United States.\"\nMr Pistole did not specify in his testimony how those accounts in Pakistan were funded.\nThe FBI has estimated that the 9/11 attacks cost between $175,000-250,000. That money, which paid for flight training, travel and other expenses, flowed to the hijackers through associates in Germany and the United Arab Emirates.\nAl-Qaeda associates reported to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who managed much of the planning for the attacks from Pakistan, the FBI said. Mr Pistole did not discuss reports that some support for the Sept 11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia as well.\n\"Terrorism Financing: Origination,"}

Amid the clamor, the widening schism between police and Oakland\u2019s youth has been brought to light.\nI caught up with Oakland-bred rapper Mistah FAB to discuss his reactions to the recent violence and the plight of young people in Oakland. His personal history is emblematic of Oakland\u2019s legacy: Born and raised in Oakland, his family history includes both pimps and Black Panthers. With a brother just recently sentenced to 432 years in prison, Mistah FAB continues his work as a mainstay in Bay Area youth outreach efforts. Given his familiarity with both the ups and downs of The Town, I was curious to see how he felt about our current predicament.\nWhat was your reaction to the killings of Oscar Grant, the four OPD officers and Lovelle Mixon?\nI was upset and saddened, but you have to remember that [police brutality] is a problem that has consistently gone on way before these officers were killed and way before Oscar Grant was assassinated. This is a problem that has plagued the streets of Oakland for many years. And until the communication gap between the police and the people is bridged, these things will continue to happen.\nWhat do you think would be a productive way to move forward in the wake of these tragedies?\nMe and my brother were talking today about what\u2026 we can do to bridge that gap and do something in the community [because] right now it\u2019s a \u201cy\u2019all against us\u201d type attitude.\nBeing the person I am, I can sit down with the killer of a close friend of mine just to hear his ideology\u2026 without being so revengeful and full of rage that I can\u2019t talk to them. So, I have no problem sitting down with some of the heads of the police force and asking them, \u201cWould you mind having an open discussion with the people that have been affected by some [of] the things that people on your force have done?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t mind a weekly town hall meeting in which some of the most notorious police officers, known for doing malicious acts in the community, sit down with those who have been viciously attacked and get it all out.\nThat\u2019s a burden on the shoulders of the community that the police never want to acknowledge. They do a lot of different things and it all gets swept under the rug. To all the police that have harassed and planted illegal substances on the youth, let\u2019s come forth and let\u2019s talk.\nDo you think a large part of this burden and communication gap is related to young people?\nYeah, I do. And I think people today have given up on the youth. I saw my little homeboy today\u2013[he\u2019s] 12 years old. I saw him on his bike smoking a blunt. So when he sees me, you would have thought that he saw the police. He threw the blunt and I pulled over and talked to him.

You can replace the fixtures without unbolting the pedestal sink from the wall or removing its leg.\nTurn off the water supply to the sink.

He said there could be added benefit if the movie does well at box offices. The scenes filmed in Tucumcari could be site attractions for tourist and future films may consider using Tucumcari, the city manager added.\nSeveral streets in the downtown are were closed to traffic while the film crew operated from 7 a.m. to noon. The street closure caused some offices and business to close completely while others remained open with impaired access by clients and customers.\nOne of the offices affected by the street closures was the Quay County DWI Compliance Office at 113 East Main Street. As police officers manned a roadblock at East Center Street and South First Street, several clients trying to make their required Monday check-in where turned away.\nSome of the clients were able to get through and some called to make arraignments to come in later, said Bryan Rinestine, DWI coordinator.\nRinestine said he is happy the film crews chose Tucumcari, but he added there could have been a little bit more planning to perhaps permit the filming to be finished during the weekend. He said Mondays are a busy day for the DWI Compliance office, considering every client must make a required check in that day each week.\nRix Security, at 105 South First Street, had to close the morning of the filming because of its location and the film crews requested that no vehicles be parked along the street, \u201cIt was a big inconvenience having to close Monday the morning,\u201d said business owner Susan Taylor.\nTaylor said several appointments that had been made for Monday had to be rescheduled and while they could make out-of-office service calls, Rix was limited on what services it could provide.

But he also noted that \"senior management has not been held accountable\" in a case that has hurt both consumers who thought they were getting a good product and blue-collar and middle-management workers at VW. He said the VW case \"attacks and destroys\" the foundation of the country's economic system \u2014 the trust between buyers and sellers.\nCox had harsh words for Schmidt, seeing no excuses for the highly educated mechanical engineer. He doesn't suffer from the substance abuse common among criminals, comes from a good family and was well-off financially, with a $130,000 base salary, $40,000 annual bonuses and a net worth of $1 million.\n\"You saw this attempted coverup of this massive fraud in the United States as an opportunity to impress senior management at VW and therefore advance your career at VW,\" Cox told Schmidt.\nCox sided with the U.S. Attorney's Office in its sentencing recommendation. The defense, led by attorney David DuMouchel of Detroit, had requested 40 months and a $100,000 fine.\nProsecutors portrayed Schmidt, a German national who will be deported after serving his sentence, as uncooperative. They said he destroyed documents pertinent to the investigation and encouraged subordinates to do the same, lied about his involvement and was a key player in the conspiracy, which cost VW about $17 billion in civil settlements and an extra $4.3 billion to settle criminal charges.\nAccording to court officials, numerous other VW and Audi employees have been charged but remain at large in the case.\nThe company installed so-called defeat devices, a type of software, on its diesel vehicles that were designed to make the vehicles perform differently in road and test conditions, which led to significantly higher levels of pollution in actual use than permitted. Authorities said VW installed the software on about 500,000 2.0-liter diesel vehicles sold in the United States between 2009 and 2015.\nBen Singer, deputy chief of the local U.S. Attorney's Office criminal division, said Schmidt was the \"conduit between the senior people in Germany and the regulators.\"\nHe noted that Schmidt briefed former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn directly in July 2015. Singer said Schmidt is not the most culpable person in the case, although he did not disclose who he believes is.\nSchmidt's lawyers said he was a 48-year-old engineer with no criminal history who was \"less culpable\" than others, including co-defendant and engineer James Liang who was sentenced in August to 40 months in prison.

I had computer classes in high school, but never really owned one after a year in college (thanks to my geek uncle in the US \u2014 thanks, Tito Vic, I never forget). And the rest, as we say, is history.\nToday, with all the latest technology I could get my hands on, my children tend to be exposed to them early, too.\nIt is one thing to keep up with the latest technology that your children are exposed to, it is another to use that technology to narrow the gap between you and your children. Communication is always the key to narrowing this gap. Yes, children will always have those earphones stuck in their ear canals, but you need to set boundaries on when it is appropriate for them to do that.\nIt is now easier to keep that line of communications open. SMS, voice calls, iMessage, FaceTime, Snapchat, Google+ Hangout, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, you name it, there are different ways to keep touch with your kids. Establishing simple rules of when you can reach them would do wonders. For example, get your kids to send a message when s/he reaches school, when s/he leaves, when s/he gets home. Going beyond this, of course, is even better. In my case, I make sure that I find a good internet connection wherever I go out of town just so I can FaceTime with the family. Seeing their faces on the iPad\u2019s screen do wonders, even if sometimes you think of it as just a plain call.\nThere are other innovative ways of using technology to diminish that gap. I remember reading about an app, actually an iBook, that allows you to record your voice while reading a bed-time story. So when you are on a trip, your child can use the app, a Read-Aloud book, while hearing your voice. Awesome, eh?\nFacebook or other social networking site is also a good way to keep tabs of your children, provided, of course, that your children add you as a friend. This may go both ways \u2014 stalking them or simply keeping tabs of their activities \u2014 setting boundaries definitely is a good start.

A gap in the technology, widens the gap between the two.

Articles of incorporation are the way that businesses formally acknowledge that they intend to form a corporation. This document also details how you plan to structure and run your corporation.\nThe idea of the corporation as a separate entity goes back to ancient times, but the modern corporation developed out of Queen Elizabeth I's East Indian Trading Company in 1601, reports Citizen Works. The English crown used chartered corporations as an arm of the monarchy to serve a certain purpose. In the case of some American colonies, corporations were the liaison for the king. The legality of corporations remained even after American independence, because the country was made up of mostly agrarian farmers and not concerned with large companies gaining too much power.\nAll states require businesses to file their articles of incorporation if the entity wants to become a corporation, according to FindLaw. In the situation of a limited liability company (LLC), the owner files articles of organization. These are essentially the same thing as articles of incorporation because LLCs share many of the same characteristics as corporations, such as limited liability.\nThe articles of incorporation include the most basic information about the company, such as location of the initiating agent, the reason for incorporation, management hierarchy and the amount of stock available, states Investopedia. The initiating agent is usually the president of the company or anyone who handles legal paperwork and mail. Most states use a rubber-stamped state of purpose, such as to function within the legal limits of a corporation or something just as vague.\nArticles of Incorporation are essentially the equivalent of a birth, according to Georgia attorney Steve Mills. Once a state approves articles of incorporation and signs the certification of incorporation, the corporation can hammer out more important details. After this, the corporation works out its bylaws, such as how the corporation will govern itself, shareholders' rights and establishing owner and shareholder meetings.\nIf the state makes you fill out the statement of purpose yourself, make sure to leave it as open ended as possible, suggests Inc.com. This way, should you want to change the type of business you run or expand, you do not have to hire an attorney to amend your articles of incorporation.\nHuebsch, Russell. \"The Primary Purpose of Articles of Incorporation.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/primary-purpose-articles-incorporation-2580.html.

Strong demand for new commercial airplanes in downstream markets and increased defense spending on military aircraft boosted demand for industry products.\nWith rising fuel prices, international and domestic carriers increased their demand for new, more fuel-efficient airplanes. As a result, aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing, increased their purchases of flight data recorders (FDRs) and cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) since they are a necessary good in almost all aircraft.\nIn addition, the military increased its activity in Afghanistan, driving growth for new military aircraft and positively affecting industry demand. ?The high sales volumes, combined with product price increase, have helped the industry offset higher input costs, such as those of steel,? says IBISWorld industry analyst Mary Nanfelt.\nDespite strong demand from downstream markets, commercial aircraft activity slowed during the recession, restraining overall industry growth. From 2007 to 2012, industry revenue is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 0.5% to $264.6 million, including an increase of 1.9% in 2012.\nFrom 2012 to 2017, Flight Data Recorder (Black Box) Manufacturing industry growth is projected to pick up. International and domestic carriers will continue to demand more airplanes due to improved technology and an expansion of airline companies in Asia. With more new airplanes, more FDRs and CVRs will be demanded.\nIn addition, the price of steel is expected to remain stable, keeping costs and profit margins constant. ?Although the industry will grow, it will be negatively affected by the reduction in defense spending by the US government,? adds Nanfelt. As federal funding for defense declines, fewer new military aircraft will be needed, so fewer industry devices will be demanded for these planes.\nAlthough the industry is expanding, the number of companies in this industry is expected to remain constant. Current major players include L-3 Communications Corporation, Honeywell International Inc., Teledyne and Universal Avionics. Given that industry equipment is highly regulated, production of these devices is tightly controlled and so there are few companies operating in the industry.\nThe industry has high barriers to since it manufactures a very technical device and has a limited number of customers who require such products. Furthermore, the capital investment necessary to produce these devices is high, further limiting competition in the industry. Major companies in this industry that specialize in defense products submit bids that detail proposed technical solutions and designs and cost estimates to win government contracts.

{"idx": "8795", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Should Clemson Quarterback Trevor Lawrence Go To The XFL?\nWould Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence play in the XFL instead of continuing his college career?\nThat\u2019s the question floated by ProFootballTalk, and it\u2019s not as crazy as it might sound. Lawrence must play at least two more seasons in college before he can take his shot at the NFL, and the XFL will be around before that time expires. That means there is a very real pro league that would take him if he wanted to get paid before heading to the NFL.\n(Oliver) Luck has said the league will pay salaries in the $250,000-$300,000 range for top players (i.e. quarterbacks) for what could be a five-month commitment. That\u2019s an alternative for a player who doesn\u2019t want to develop his skills for room and board and the opportunity to take classes which fit into his football schedule.\nCollege players can also take out \u201closs of value\u201d insurance policies to protect themselves against an injury which would affect their draft stock.\nThere\u2019s no indication that Lawrence is anything but happy with his Clemson experience and wants to stay. But if he decides he\u2019d rather get paid while developing, it sounds like there\u2019s a league that would be happy to let him.\nWill this happen? Almost certainly not, but it\u2019s a fun idea to consider. The experience somebody gets as a college football star is second to none. You\u2019re pretty much treated as a god on campus.\nPlus, you\u2019re developing your skills with some of the best coaches in America if you\u2019re at a program like Clemson. I have no idea who will be running the show in the XFL, but I\u2019d be shocked if they had coaches as good as major college teams. That would be surprising to me.\nThe only upside to the XFL is the money, and $300,000 for five months of work is no joke. However, Lawrence will make more than $30 million guaranteed if he\u2019s the first overall pick in the 2021 draft. He won\u2019t get a penny of that if he goes to the XFL and gets hurt. Risking an NFL career and the earnings that come with being a quarterback for a year of solid money doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense.\nThe only way I\u2019d do that is if my family desperately needed money. We\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest that\u2019s the case with Lawrence. If I were him, I\u2019d keep balling out at Clemson until it was time to get that NFL money. It\u2019s fun to debate, but I don\u2019t see it happening."}

And we\u2019ll probably be in a classroom studying accounting, pro-formas and cash flow.\nThis week I\u2019ll be a fly on the wall at Based in Business, a bootcamp for Canadian Forces veterans who want to become more formidable entrepreneurs. This particular camp, one of three being organized by the Prince\u2019s Charities Canada and Futurpreneur (formerly Canadian Youth Business Foundation), is being held at the University of Regina, with classes taught by university business professors and local entrepreneurs, and personal support for each attendee supplied by hard-working members of Enactus Regina, a student club for aspiring entrepreneurs.\nTwo years ago, I reported how I had called the Department of Veterans Affairs to find out what programs they offer retiring military personnel to start their own businesses. After all, thousands of veterans are being released from the Forces every year, and the job market is tough. A VA spokesperson told me they didn\u2019t offer any such program.\nThat\u2019s unacceptable. The most recent statistics from Veterans Affairs Canada indicate 7% of veterans are self-employed, but that number is seven years old and seems low. (A recent U.S. survey found U.S. veterans 45% more likely than the non-veteran population to be self-employed. If the Canadian experience is similar, the percentage of self-employed veterans in Canada would be about 15%.) Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t just an option for many retiring Forces personnel \u2014 for some, particularly those still suffering physical or mental anguish from their time served, it\u2019s the only option. The same 2010 survey showed 25% of recent Canadian veterans reported difficulty adapting to civilian life.\nFortunately, Enactus Memorial, in St. John\u2019s, Nfld., developed such a program. And the Prince\u2019s Charities Canada, with the encouragement of Charles, Prince of Wales, took Based in Business national.\nI\u2019ll be reporting from Regina, and plan to produce an eBook afterwards, a business startup handbook geared to veterans. (Working title: Startups for Heroes.)

They include a 23-year serving officer who wants to start an in-home tutoring service; a 27-year Navy veteran setting up a travel and event-management business; a 35-year warrant officer who produces wooden outdoor furniture; and a 32-year senior officer starting a home-inspection business.\nBased on the evidence so far, most of the \u201cvetrepreneurs\u201d in Regina are following the first rule of entrepreneurship: Do what you love. They seem to be developing personal-service firms or niche product companies based on what they already know how to do. That\u2019s good for several reasons: one-person firms require less capital and minimal operating costs; doing what you know shrinks the learning curve; and loving what you do makes things easier when times get tough.\nBut my wish is that, over time, we can get more veterans (and other entrepreneurs) to think bigger.

But then I couldn't stop listening.\nI first discovered podcasts in 2006 with \"The Ricky Gervais Show.\" I remember flying from Dublin to New York and listening to the entire first season without a break. Then, on the way back, I did the same with everyone around me sleeping. I was 19 and my mom was terminally ill.\nWhen she died a year later, I remember getting into bed that night and listening to \"The Ricky Gervais Show\" again and being able to forget about what had happened until morning, when I was awoken by people coming and going and crying. From the earbuds tangled up in my sheets, I could still hear Gervais\u2019 shrill laughter ringing out, so I popped them back in and, again, life went away.\nWhen things got easier, I listened to sports podcasts. But when I say listened, I don\u2019t mean I downloaded a new episode and then waited a week for the next one. Rather I downloaded the entire back catalog and consumed them all. I\u2019d turned 21 by that point and had met a girl and fallen in love. Thinking back to our first few dates, I recall the walks to meet her being soundtracked by football podcasts from two years prior. None of the games under discussion were relevant.\nClearly listening to them went beyond my interest in sport: Maybe something therapeutic was happening. Or maybe I was self-medicating, blocking out the organic moments of life, which were still sometimes painful, and replacing them with chatter. I told myself that, because everyone was listening to music all the time, augmenting their own realities constantly, that what I was doing was no different, and there was nothing to be worried about. But what I couldn\u2019t admit was that, if the music comparison held true, I was probably more Rob from \"High Fidelity\" than the average guy listening to Coldplay on his way to work.\nMaybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. Back then, podcasts weren\u2019t so much an obstacle to happiness as something I enjoyed along with my girlfriend. When I look back, what I mostly see isn\u2019t someone obsessed with podcasts but someone obsessed with the girl he loved. We still went on dates and day trips; I\u2019d go visit her in college all the time. We would just party. We would be young.\nI remember it getting bad in Germany. We had gone there in 2011 for work, and I discovered \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and many others. Having no friends, barely able to speak the language and unhappy at my job, it was nice to listen to stuff being spoken about in English by funny, creative people. So every day, riding the tram, I neglected the chance to improve my German by listening to the voices around me. Instead, I hid behind my earbuds, hoping no one would ask what I was smiling at because I could never explain auf Deutsch.\nIn my slightly better English, I couldn\u2019t either. Though it was mainly just comedians talking, opening up about their dark pasts, I could only experience the feeling that they gave me, that electric jolt that sometimes made it hard to depart the tram and walk those last remaining minutes to work. Life just seemed too much then, so ecstatically brilliant to the point where it felt like it would crush me. So at moments like these I occasionally wouldn\u2019t depart, letting the stop sail by instead.\nGermany sucked, then, not because it was Germany, but because it was a life I never imagined myself living."}

So our dance-dramas are an extension of some kind of worship or prayer.\"\nThirumalai was speaking from the Natyamani School of Dance in Westborough, Mass., which she directs with her husband, Ajai.\nThe couple have put together this two-part piece, which received its premiere last weekend in Queens, N.Y. The production then moved to Philadelphia before coming to Orange County. The two-month tour concludes Nov. 3 in Florida. \"It's a traditional story,\" Thirumalai said. \"It is not derived from the 'Ramayana' or the 'Mahabharata.' \"\nThe drama begins in the time-honored way with a ceremonial procession in which the gods are honored. There follows a sequence of six episodes, including the birth of Ganesha, the elephant-headed first son of the couple, Siva and Parvati, as Sakti is also called.\n\"He's created as an ideal,\" Thirumalai said. \"He comes to life as a brave young lad. He is instructed to guard Parvati's bedroom and stops Siva when he tries to enter. Siva beheads him, and Parvati rushes out bewailing the fate of her darling son.\n\"Siva realizes his error and affixes an elephant's head on the boy, then brings him back to life. He crowns him Lord of the Ganas.\"\nThe birth of the second son, Subrahmanya, comes next, and then other episodes follow.\n\"The first part delineates the glories of Siva,\" Thirumalai said. \"Then we glorify Sakti--she who gives happiness to mankind. She combines strength and the gentleness of the female principal.\"\nThe whole concludes with episodes of pure rhythmic dance and then another procession. \"With the final procession,\" Thirumalai said, \"the rituals come full circle.\"\nThe style of the dance is Bharata Natyam, the classical dance idiom of southern India. It will be exemplified here in the Vazhuvoor tradition, \"a graceful and very precise style,\" Thirumalai said.\nThe work was choreographed by Smt. R.

Eighty-six percent of Millennials said if someone raises questions about faith, they know how to respond. But evangelism today has received a bad reputation in American society.

Now they are becoming an endangered species.

The video was from the tsunami that struck Indonesia in December last year.\nAs Christians, we can be hesitant to share our faith with others because we don\u2019t want to offend. We don\u2019t want to be labeled as an extremist. We don\u2019t want to create an uncomfortable situation. But if we sense the urgency of eternity and recognize how severe our need is for Jesus, how can we not tell others about Him?\nHutchcraft suggests we start by reaching our spheres of influence with the Gospel \u2014 our family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, and even your connections on social media.\nThink of someone you know who doesn\u2019t have a relationship with Jesus. Commit to praying for their salvation. Pray for an opportunity to talk with that person about the impact Christ has on your life.\nHutchcraft references the moment in Exodus 4 when God commands Moses to serve as His mouthpiece to the pharaoh of Egypt and the Israelites. As a sign to the Israelites, God tells Moses to throw his staff on the ground. When Moses does this, it miraculously turns into a snake. And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Throughout Exodus, God uses Moses\u2019s staff to perform several miracles for His people.\nFor example, Hutchcraft says, \u201cI heard recently of one brother who has invited all kinds of Muslim refugees over to his house because he loves to cook.

The 75-pound structure contains approximately 15,000 inches of hosiery, mostly using the waistband due to its durability and flexibility. An armature supports the sculpture; it was made to resemble the circular knitting machines Soucie used during the creation process.

The second portion consists of \u201cseating devices\u201d stuffed with natural latex foam bedding.

The two main culprits behind Trump's vacillations on the subject appear to be his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who placed the blame for Trump's failure to work with Congress on an immigration deal squarely on Miller's shoulders.\n\"Every time we have a proposal it is only yanked back by staff members.

Today, he said, Prescott homes and businesses are generating about 220 tons of recyclables per month. That is up from about 150 tons per month just five years ago.\nMcDowell and other city officials are hoping that the rising participation in the program will result in a better deal for local recycling. The city is currently out for bid for the handling of its residential recyclables, and plans to open the bids on Nov. 6. With the higher amount of materials, officials say, the local program should be in line to get a better rate.\nUp to this point, McDowell said, recycling \"hasn't really made us much money.\" But he noted that the \"more tons of recyclables you have,\" the better chance the system has of turning a profit.\nCurrently, Prescott offers curbside recycling to all of its 15,000 residential trash customers. Along with the green containers for garbage, the city also automatically distributes a blue recycling container.\nThen, it's up to the individual households to choose whether to participate. McDowell estimates that about 80 percent of the 15,000 households do. Most of those fill up their 32- or 65-gallon recycling containers about every other week.\nAfter city trucks pick up the recyclables, they transport the materials first to the city's transfer station on Sundog Ranch Road. Then, the city pays a hauler to take the materials to Flagstaff, where they end up in a \"material recovery facility.\" The city currently has a contract with the City of Flagstaff to handle its recyclables.\nEven as McDowell acknowledges that recycling is not a big moneymaker for the city, he also cautions that expenses and revenues do not tell the whole story.\nBy McDowell's estimate, the city spends about$1 million per year on its recycling program, which includes about $140,000 in hauling costs and tipping fees in Flagstaff. Meanwhile, Prescott earns about $30,000 per year in revenues for the recyclable commodities.\nBut at the same time, the city is saving a substantial amount by not having to dispose all of the recyclables in the landfill. While the city pays $34 per ton for handling of its recyclables, it pays $37 per ton for disposing of garbage in the Grey Wolf Landfill in Dewey.\nAnd ultimately, McDowell said, recycling \"is the right thing to do for the environment.\"\nCity equipment operator Dan Rogers expressed similar views, as he navigated a truck through the streets this past week, collecting the recyclables from the blue containers.\n\"Our department prides itself on customer service,\" Rogers said, noting that he tries to ensure that as much material as possible makes it into the"}

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that if current population growth trends continue, one in four adolescent girls will be in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, and that the total number of adolescent mothers in this zone will increase from 10.1 million in 2010 to 16.4 million in 2030. Most of Africa\u2019s adolescent mothers are child brides married before the age of 18 years\u2014the age of maturity, designated in United Nations Conventions such as the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Child marriage, often referred to as forced or early marriage, is a formal marriage or an informal union taking place in the shadows of society\u2014as it is underreported and largely practiced under customary and religious laws.\nChild marriage is shaped by custom, religion and poverty and exacerbated by ethno-religious crisis, conflict and environmental disasters. Girls are denied the right to education, made to toil in domestic servitude and live in physical seclusion in their husbands\u2019 marital homes. Child brides everywhere are disempowered, vulnerable and exploited. Implications go behind the well-being of the child: Child marriage negatively impacts socio-economic development of regions and nations as well as global stability. Gordon Brown, in a 2013 review of child marriage, observes that infants born to child mothers under the age of 18 are 60 percent more likely to die in the first year of life than infants born to mothers 19 years and older. World Bank studies by Nguyen and Wodon (2012) note that for each year of early marriage, the probability of literacy for the girl is reduced by 5.6 percentage points, and the probability of secondary school completion declines by 6.5 percentage points. In Africa, where the median age of marriage is younger, girls have even less access to educational, family planning and obstetric care services. In addition, the millions of girls in Africa who marry before age 18 are more likely to have few or no years of schooling, reside in poorer and rural areas, be victims of physical or sexual violence, have their right to free movement restricted, and be denied access to health and social services.\nAlthough the practice is on the decline worldwide and in North Africa in particular, in sub-Saharan Africa child marriage continues to be a dominant form of customary unions as the options of school and youth employment remain unattainable in the largely agrarian economies of this region. While the absolute numbers and prevalence of child marriages are highest in South Asia, many experts agree that the intensity, pattern and context of child marriage in sub-Saharan Africa in general and West Africa in particular make this phenomenon most severe and detrimental to the lives of girls. The mean spousal age difference between husband and wife is 5 years more in West Africa compared to East and Southern Asia, the age of first pregnancies and total number of adolescent pregnancies are"}

The center, described on its website as \"the gateway to collections documenting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history and culture,\" is home to many of Milk's papers as well as the archives of The Mayor of Castro Street author Randy Shiltz. Emery conducted more investigative work at San Francisco's GLBT Historical Society. Additionally, he scoured the Bay Area's television archives for interviews on Milk.\n\"Interviews,\" took Emery nearly three years to complete, and was originally intended to be finished by 2010. \" I actually started it thinking, 'Well, this will be a valuable book and it won't take that long to do,'\" said Emery. \"I was wrong about the second half.\"\nEmery noted that obtaining the rights to various interviews was one of the more difficult parts of the process. Whoever originally recorded various radio interviews and televised debates owned the rights to those recordings, and most of the contents obtained for the book were not public interviews. Emery said the compilation of \"Interviews\" required a lot of \"detective work\" and some Indiana Jones-esque moments of discovery.\nOne anecdote Emery recounted was his discovery of a recording of the longest \"Briggs vs. Milk\" debate on eBay. In the recording, Milk and California State Senator John Briggs debated the infamous Proposition 6 Briggs Initiative, a 1978 California proposition that, had it passed, would have removed gay teachers from public schools. After Emery acquired the recording, he had to \"hunt down\" the owner to obtain the rights to publish it. Fortunately, Dan Nicoletto, a former employee of Milk's store, Castro Camera, aided him in his quest.\nThe Briggs debate portion of \"Interviews\" is as exciting as it is informative. In one televised interview, in which no formalized debate structure was established, the verbal sparring between Briggs and Milk reads like a teleplay. These and other passages are marked by Milk's superb wit. \"Here is a man who loved to talk and did it well,\" said Emery.\nEmery had originally considered editing Brigg's lengthy speeches out of the debates before he decided to publish them in full. \"It's really important for people to see these arguments,\" said Emery. \"I was surprised that some of these same arguments"}

While women and men are as likely to be registered to vote and there are no differences by educational level, young Kenyans are far less likely than their older counterparts to say they are registered to vote. Kenyans between the ages of 18 and 22 -- who were too young to vote in the last presidential election -- are far less likely than those who are older to say they are registered to vote. This finding suggests that this group of potential voters may either not be interested in participating in the election or face obstacles in registering to vote and perhaps voting.\nThe IEBC will use several new technologies, including electronic voter registration, to ensure the elections are transparent, free, and fair. But there is controversy about the tender process to obtain the equipment and the logistics of implementing these solutions before the election. Current registered voters in Kenya are slightly more likely than those who have yet to register to say the current process to register to vote is easy, but the majority of both groups see the process as easy.\nAmong those who are not currently registered to vote, a majority say they plan to do so soon. However, more than one in five say they are not registered voters yet because they do not have the proper documentation. To register, Kenyans must be 18 years old or older, meet specific residency requirements, and have the most current version of the national ID card. While 93% of all Kenyan adults say they have an ID card, those aged 18 to 22 are the least likely to say so -- 79% compared with more than 95% in the other age groups.\nIn addition, 8% of currently unregistered voters say the main reason why they are not registered is that they do not want to do so. Other reasons include the perceived distance to the registration center, with 5% of Kenyan adults thinking it is too far away from their home, lack of knowledge about the registration process (4%), and the perception that it is too late to do so (1%).\nIn the wake of the post-election violence that engulfed Kenya in 2008, confidence in the then-electoral commission had plunged to 24% from a high of 62% the previous year -- as reports of electoral mismanagement became known. The IEBC, which came into effect after Kenyans approved a new constitution in 2010, is responsible for running the elections, from voter registration to the announcement of the results. As such, the institution lies at the heart of ensuring free and fair elections in the country.\nAt the time of the Gallup survey, more than nine in 10 Kenyans aged 18 and older said they were confident the IEBC could manage the entire electoral process in Kenya, with 5"}

{"idx": "8853", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Newswise \u2014 An international research team led by Tim Nilsen, Ph.D., a professor of medicine and biochemistry and the director of the School of Medicine's Center for RNA Molecular Biology, has discovered an unexpected mechanism governing alternative splicing, the process by which single genes produce different proteins in different situations. The new mechanism suggests that curing the more than half of genetic diseases that are caused by mutations in the genetic code that in turn create mistakes in alternative splicing may be considerably more complicated than biomedical researchers have previously assumed. Those diseases include a large number of cancers and many neurodegenerative diseases.\nThe research, titled \"Dynamic regulation of alternative splicing by silencers that modulate 5' splice site competition\" is published in the December 24 issue of Cell. Nilsen led an international team of researchers from Case Western Reserve University, Columbia University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute in New York City, and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in, Germany. Case post-doctoral fellow Yang Yu, Ph.D. was the lead author.\n\"Regular\" splicing is the process by which long strings of nucleotides in a gene's pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) are discarded, and the remaining strings of nucleotides are spliced together into one continuous strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) that produces one unique protein.\nBut regular splicing is insufficient to produce all the proteins in the human cell, where 25,000 genes surprisingly produce more than 100,000 proteins. The additional 75,000 proteins are created by alternative splicing, a process that selectively activates alternate splicing sites along the pre-messenger RNA strand to assemble different subsets of RNA nucleotides into a variety of mRNA's. Each mRNA then produces a single protein. The vast majority of genes utilize alternative splicing.\nAlthough it creates needed proteins, alternative splicing can also lead to problems. Mistakes in alternative splicing caused by changes (mutations) in DNA sequences create more than half of all genetic diseases. For instance, sometimes the resulting mRNA includes nucleotide sequences that should have been deleted. Because the molecular mechanisms responsible for splice site choice remain poorly understood, Nilsen and his colleagues decided to study how some potential splice sites are \"silenced,\" preventing them from forming splices while causing other, weaker splice sites to make splices instead. To do this they created a synthetic pre-mRNA containing two alternative splice sites, a weak site and a much stronger site downstream of it. Only one of them can be activated to make each possible mRNA, and whichever one the genetic machinery chooses, it then deletes a section of pre-mRNA from that beginning point to a common ending point downstream of both beginning splice points.\nThe research team randomized all possible combinations of nucleotides in a sequence of 12 nucleotides just downstream of the stronger splice site and in 12 just upstream of it, their exact positions chosen so that they would be as close as possible to the splice site without interfering with the very nearest nucleotides, which are required to complete the splices. This work was done both in vitro and in vivo, with similar results.\nIn control synthetic pre-mRNA's where the weak upstream splice site was left out, splicing always took place between the preferable downstream spl"}

And this assurance seems especially needed now, following last week's massacre in a Colorado high school.\nNotice, this biblical prayer speaks to who we really are: loved of God. And it spells out where we really are: between His shoulders, in God's safe presence. This is as true of those who died as it is of those who survived.\nOf course, this promise of safety stands at odds with last week's tragedy. And here we each have a choice. We can be overwhelmed by the awful news. Or, we can begin the work of overwhelming it with a wave of prayer that never stops, with the intent of inspiring a sense of Love and Life in the community. We can begin the work of washing public thought free of hate, of selfishness, of the impulse toward further unthinking, destructive behavior.\nTo know our true status and our true place in God's presence is to be better equipped to pray for all the children of the world.\nThink of God as divine Love and as divine Life. Love and Life are inextinguishable. To be loved of the Lord is to be the object of divine Love's deep contemplation. To be loved of the Lord is to be the focus of divine Life's full attention. God never stops knowing us as His own. We're God's expression, in God's own realm. God ceaselessly maintains us under a safe covering all day long. \"Between his shoulders.\"\nIf we took the safe haven of God's \"shoulders\" to mean only a physical location, we'd be missing the larger promise of Moses' blessing - that our children can never be outside of God's presence. This is what reassures us that they are always safe.\nWhen we hold to the good thoughts we derive from God, we are making a prayer. A prayer that makes a positive difference. That difference may seem modest, even unmeasurable, at first. But it is real. Through it, things will begin to happen. Shifts in individual thought and public outlook will take place. Circumstances will begin to adjust for the better.\nAccording to Christ, genuine prayer has mountain-moving capacity (see Matt. 17:20). Right now, perhaps, the mountains most in need of moving may seem Everest-size masses of hate, alienation, mindless aping of violent movies and video games. In the face of this, seeking the good thoughts that come from God - of our true status as His beloved, and of our abiding-place as perpetually in His care - is praying a prayer that at least begins the mountain-moving process.\nGranted, some people see praying as powerless, pointless. But think for a moment. Even if you hesitate to credit actual power to prayer, isn't praying at least better than being paralyzed by anguish? Isn't it more helpful than crying out \"WHY?\" without any meaningful answer?\nHonestly, prayer has proved not to be pointless. Or to be too late. Genuine prayer has shown the good thoughts from divine Life and Love to result in sheltering and, when needed, comforting. It has brought greater assurance and less uncertainty. It has been found relevant to every circumstance. Prayer lifts human consciousness higher. Not just individual consciousness, but consciousness as a whole. People everywhere are touched by prayer.\nFor anyone wanting to pray for the safety of all children, the founder of this newspaper, Mary Baker Eddy, offered some specifics"}

The move is opening doors to supplying Syrian opposition with protection from chemical weapons.\nThe Arms Export Control Act (AECA) allows the US president to waive provisions in Sections 40 and 40A, which forbid providing munitions, credit and licenses to countries supporting acts of terrorism. But those prohibitions can be waived \"if the President determines that the transaction is essential to the national security interests of the United States.\"\nPresident Barrack Obama ordered such a waiver for supplying chemical weapons-related assistance to \"select vetted members\" of Syrian opposition forces, the administration announced on Monday.\nThe announcement came after a UN report, which confirmed that sarin gas was indeed used in Syria on August 21, but didn\u2019t point to either the Syrian army or the rebel forces as the culprits.\nThe US plan to provide chemical weapons-related assistance to Syrian opposition was in the works before the August attack a senior administration official said as cited by NBC News. Under the AEC rules, it will take at least 15 days before any of the materials can be officially shipped to Syria.\nThe Syrian opposition groups are increasingly dominated by radical Islamists, many of them foreign fighters who, the UN says, are involved in numerous crimes committed in Syria. According to estimates of defense consultancy IHS Jane's, more than a half of the forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad government are jihadists. The US explicitly listed Al-Nusra Front, a powerful Al-Qaeda-linked part of the Syrian opposition, as a terrorist organization.\nStill, US politicians believe national intelligence community can ensure that the military assistance goes to the right hands.\n\"Our intelligence agencies, I think, have a very good handle on who to support and who not to support,\" Senator Bob Corker said on CBS on Sunday. \"And there's going to be mistakes. We understand some people are going to get arms that should not be getting arms. But we still should be doing everything we can to support the free Syrian opposition.\"\nThe US, France and UK announced their intention to provide more help to the Syrian opposition after a Monday meeting of foreign ministers in Paris. US Secretary of State said the US pursuits a political solution of the Syrian crisis, which would deliver a future Syria without Bashar Assad.\nThe US in the past provided non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, like vehicles, night goggles and body armor. CIA also reportedly helped countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to smuggle weapons to the rebels.\nDamascus denied any responsibility for the August sarin attack. But it agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons stockpile after a call from Russia. The move put on hold US plan to use military force against Syria in retaliation for the alleged use of chemical weapons."}

The news was read in Mandarin Chinese.\nCox Radio, a large broadcasting company based in Atlanta, announced on Monday that it had sold WGBB for $1.7 million. The buyer was WGBB-AM Inc., a company owned by Josephine Cheng, a former disk jockey in Taiwan who also owns the Chinese Radio Network, which broadcasts in Mandarin over a sub-carrier signal, a type of FM signal available only on special radios.\nSome local radio station owners and journalists who cover radio said the sale of WGBB reflected a growing trend among small AM stations. As the FM radio industry becomes increasingly consolidated in the hands of a few large companies that concentrate on mainstream programming, they said, AM stations are increasingly turning to more specialized audiences with ethnic and other ''niche'' programs.\nThese stations typically sell chunks of time for set fees to outside producers who do their own ethnic shows.

{"idx": "8870", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A recent TIME Magazine article entitled \"Leaving Tests Behind\" reported on the call to re-examine the use of standardized tests to account for the meeting of a national standard. The trend to use standardized tests to account for common benchmarks of student achievement and, of course, a way to hold all schools accountable has given rise to questions about the impact on children. Legislating these standardized tests came from the belief that it would be beneficial if all children in the country were held to the same standards and, in turn, their schools would all be moving toward the same goals. The intentions are not the problem but the tests have become the only important things. The impact of the testing environment on some children has raised questions. Now arise the response backlash discussions about leaving tests and grading behind.\nTo categorize objects around us is extremely important. When you recognize an object as a member of a particular category, all your knowledge about that category guides your response to that thing. So you don't have to figure out everything every time you encounter something new.\nSo it appears the behaviors we observe and demonstrate by dividing and labeling comes very early into our lives. Clearly our brains are equipped to help us organize input and create order in our lives. Yet, we know that labeling and categorizing isn't always a good thing. This capacity to identify similarities and differences may hurt sometimes. We worry about how we break through to welcome otherness and see new relationships and potential...but that's another blog.\nThis writing is about how educators divide ourselves into categories: those who are supportive of standardized testing and national standards and those who are opposed to them or those who simply see them as too limited to effectively measure our success. If we rally around the categories, we will continue to be focused on our differences rather than a common concern.\nQuestions About the Learning Environment. Answers About Caring.\nIs there a place in today's education for the traditional classroom?\nWhat 1 thing (non-tech) can an educator do to build a better learning environment?\nWhat PD to teachers and #edadmin need to help build a better learning environment?\nWho is a role model for you in building a better learning environment?\nParticipating in #Satchat always brings new thoughts and sharing. These questions on this particular Saturday (2/7) revealed what is on the minds of current and emerging leaders, yet it may not receive the attention it needs. In a scan of the Twitter conversations that took place in response to these questions, these words and phrases were repeated: recognize bias, identify barriers, create safe learning environments, encourage teachers, develop trusting relationships, listen, inspire, reflect, respect, honor voices, ask good questions frank communication, engage, personalize, and build strong communities along with relationships, culture, meaning, and community outreach.\nAs schools continue to change the way teaching and learning take place and expect teachers and school leaders to learn new methods of teaching and assessing, a culture of care cannot be left behind. It was both refreshing and confounding that these teachers and leaders in the #Satchat discussion always came back to those aspects of human behavior that have little to do ...on the surface...with content or tests and accountability...But, just maybe, we are learning that they cannot be ignored because children, and adults also, perform best in places where these \"under the radar\" currents are happening.\nIn December, we attended a session at the Learning Forward Conference in Nashville, where Professor Joe Murphy of Vanderbilt University was discussing pastoral care for children. We couldn't imagine a topic with that focus had made it into a national education conference, nor, frankly, that he was the one presenting it. But there he was and we were delighted."}

Eventually 91 people were killed on both sides.\nBut immediately after the anti-Prayuth protest kicked off in Milan, army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said there had been no such demonstration and that the images circulated in the social media had been Photoshopped. Milan, Sansern said, was instead the scene of a strong welcome for Prayuth although in reality all leading international media outlets, such as AFP, and even local media reported the protest, part of a larger demonstration against all kinds on injustice both in Asia and Europe.\nThe Bangkok Post\u2019s* premier military reporter, Wassana Nanuam, joined the military\u2019s propaganda machine both on Facebook and Twitter, repeating exactly what Sansern had told the public \u2013 that there had been no protest and that the pictures being streamed from Milan were faked.\nWassana has emerged as of the most influential journalists in her field and rather sadly has traded her access to top figures like Prayuth and Privy Council chief Prem Tinsulanonda for not telling the truth to the public, in a daily newspaper that once was regarded as one of Asia\u2019s best.\nNor is she alone. Although the junta has set out decisively to intimidate the press through explicit threats, far too many of the country\u2019s top military reporters have been more than happy to ally themselves with the junta. As in other countries, reporters and journalists in Thailand work according to their specific assignments. With the military now ruling Thailand, those working the army beat are rising to eminence. Some have moved to work inside Government House, where the military elites have taken control.\nThis specialization in military affairs permits these reporters to get first-hand, in-depth information and to have access to key decision-makers inside the army. In so doing, they form a special relationship between reporters and military elites based on their mutual benefit. The military needs reporters and journalists to convey certain messages to the public. The reporters and journalists comply with such requests in order to maintain their close links with the army.\nWassana is chief among them, exploiting her connections with military strongmen in writing her reports, and even launching a series of books on the military. Lab Luang Prang, or Secrets, Deceptions and Disguise.\nThis is not the first time Wassana has helped the military manufacture propaganda. In the past, through her reports she has cheered Prayuth\u2019s rise to power \u2013 saying in one Facebook entry that she thought Prayuth\u2019s smile was \u201clovely.\u201d She also composed a glorified biography of Prayuth, now on sale in Thai bookstores.\nWassana continued to deny that Cronaca Milano, the Milanese daily, had reported a day early that there would be an anti-Prayuth demonstration, attesting that such a move was well planned and approved by Milan municipality. Indeed, even a leading Italian politician, Marco Cappato, participated in the anti-Prayuth"}

But those are situations that usually take hours, if not days, to develop. Now Stanford researchers are using tweets to add potentially life-saving information to ShakeMaps, which are created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program to track earthquakes, in almost real-time.\nShakeMaps are first produced using recordings, a ground motion prediction equation, and geological data from the site of the earthquake. Then witness accounts (called \u201cdid you feel it?\u201d data) collected by online surveys are used to supplement that information.\nResearchers Mahalia Miller, Lynne Burks, and Reza Zadeh say that data from Twitter is a potentially valuable addition to ShakeMaps because it \u201cis a service that enables everyone to create and share ideas and information instantly,\u201d and many of its 255 million active users are in regions that are prone to earthquakes, including parts of the U.S., Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines.

But the practice is illegal.\nThe states want to change that. The idea is for the state health department to establish a wholesale program that buys drugs from Canada and resells them to local pharmacies and hospitals. Individual states would be responsible for ensuring that the medications are safe and that importing them does save money.\n\"This statute is putting pressure on the federal government to take a harder look at these questions,\" said Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University of St. Louis, who researches drug price regulations.\nThe federal government has been slow to act on this cost issue. Skeptics say a 30-page Trump administration memo on drug pricing released late last week would likely have only limited impact.\nBut states, whose budgets for Medicaid and state employee health programs are squeezed by these costs, are moving forward.\nIn Vermont alone, drug spending has gone up by 35% from 2010 to 2015, the most recent year for which data are available.\nBackers of the state plans call the strategy a no-brainer that could save hundreds of millions of dollars. They discount concerns about drug safety, arguing that drugs from Canada are made by reputable companies, often in the same facilities and by the same firms that sell them in the U.S. \u2014 but at much higher prices.\n\"We would be bringing in drugs intended for the Canadian market, and therefore at Canadian pricing,\" Thurston said.\nThe state measures use a framework put in place by the 2003 federal law that created the Medicare Part D program. That law says the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services can approve drug importation plans if it is convinced the plans will save money and will not create any public health concerns.\nGetting approval from the Health Department, though, is likely to be an uphill battle.\nIn 15 years, the agency has never acted upon the 2003 law by approving any drug importation program.\nLast spring, when members of Congress pushed a national bill, a bipartisan group of former Food and Drug Administration commissioners came out in opposition, arguing it would be impossible to verify the absolute safety of the drugs. That bill ultimately failed to garner a majority vote.\nAlex Azar, the newly confirmed health secretary, said in a Senate hearing last fall that importation could jeopardize public health. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the drug industry echo that concern.\n\"Public health is at risk when the safety measures put in place by federal laws and regulations are undermined or absent through the importation of unapproved foreign drugs,\" an FDA spokesman said.\nSome experts, though, say the bigger issue involves the savings.\nThurston pointed to Utah state analysis that suggest the state could save $70 million in the"}

As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.\nPractically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation \"wholly depends\" on the length of the shutdown.\n\"Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,\" Bellow said.\nIn north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.\nBut long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. \"My main concern is the health of the people out here,\" said Brown, who has asthma. \"All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.\"\nIn terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site \u2014 which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts \u2014 but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.\nAt the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.\nIn Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

Reporters began to grow suspicious.\nThey were right. Some of the people who attended the event were actors paid by Netflix, but according to Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey, the actors weren't paid to attend the press event.

He said the only reason the company had a script in the first place was to satisfy Canadian law.

The study shows how age-old brain circuitry that evolved to make snap decisions on the importance of objects in the environment is now used in social situations.\nBrain scans taken while volunteers formed opinions of new acquaintances found activity surged in an ancient neural circuit that helps us make a rapid assessment of a person's character.\n\"Humans have always been engaged in making decisions on what's important and what's not, and social decision making is taking advantage of these primary systems in the brain,\" said Daniela Schiller, who led the study at New York University.\n\"Whenever you need to assign value to something, you use the same mechanism, whether it's an inanimate object or a person. It's like there's one common currency in the brain.\"\nPrevious work by neuroscientists has shown we form our first impressions well within 30 seconds of meeting people. Often, our opinion changes very little after knowing them for longer.\n\"When you meet a person, they might say something, or look a certain way, or behave a certain way, but you have very little information on which to form an opinion, but it is almost instantaneous and you can't withhold from doing it,\" said Schiller.\nIn the study, published in Nature Neuroscience, Schiller and scientists from Harvard University took brain scans of 19 volunteers who were asked to form a first impression of a series of fictional characters.\nThe volunteers were shown faces of men on a computer screen, followed by six sentences that described a mix of good and bad aspects of their character. For example, the person might have picked up his room mate's post on the way home from university, or told a fellow student they were stupid. After reading all of the sentences, the participants were asked to rate how much they liked the person on a scale from one to eight, with eight being the most likable.\nSchiller's team then looked through the images from the scanner to see what brain regions had been most active while people formed their first impressions.\nThe scans showed that two brain regions were involved in opinion-forming, the almond-shaped amygdala, which is linked to regulating emotions, and the posterior cingulate cortex, which is active in making financial decisions and putting values on the outcomes of situations.\n\"Even when we only briefly encounter others, brain regions that are important in forming evaluations are engaged, resulting in a quick first impression,\" said Elizabeth Phelps, a co-author on the study at New York University.\nUnderstanding the biological circuits involved with opinion forming might help scientists learn what happens when they are disrupted or fail to activate properly. \"It might affect the impressions you have of others, and that could feed into the basis of your relationship with them from then on,\" said Schiller."}

The Wynne government sent out rosy press releases celebrating the province\u2019s success.\nBut there were two big problems with the government\u2019s rhetoric on the economy last year, and reasons they seemed disconnected from the reality of many Ontarians\u2019 lives. First, the upbeat tone seemed oblivious to the historical context\u2014 a context in which the province\u2019s economy had been struggling for a long time.\nConsider the decade leading into 2017\u2014the years from 2007-2016. Over this period, Ontario\u2019s performance was lackluster. A recent Fraser Institute study shows that across several economic indicators, Ontario lagged well behind the national average. For inflation-adjusted economic growth per person, private-sector job creation, and median household wage growth, Ontario finished near or at the bottom of the pack of Canadian provinces.\nEven with better growth in 2017, many Ontarians were and are still feeling the aftereffects of these years. For young adults, that may have meant a tougher time finding that first job, and a slower start up the economic ladder. For other Ontarians, periods of unemployment or slower-than-hoped-for wage growth may have made it much harder to save for retirement.\nThe appropriate framing for the growth in 2017 would have been to welcome the green shoots while recognizing how much more growth is needed to make-up for lost time. Instead, we heard rhetoric implying that Ontario was once again one of the most prosperous places in North America, when it fact there\u2019s still much work to be done.\nMoreover, looking at Ontario\u2019s economic statistics through rose-coloured glasses makes it easy to miss the severity of suffering over the last decade outside of Toronto and Ottawa. A look at the regional data shows that many regions have had a more difficult economic decade than it might appear if looking solely at provincial economic statistics.\nAs another recent Fraser Institute study documents, net job growth over the past decade has been heavily concentrated in Toronto and Ottawa. Indeed, between 2008 and 2016, these two urban areas accounted for 99% of all net job growth. While some other specific regions gained jobs, if you take the rest of the province as a whole (excluding Toronto and Ottawa), there has been almost no net job growth for a decade.\nThe weakness of Ontario\u2019s economy outside Toronto and Ottawa looks even worse in a national context. Out of all Canada\u2019s large urban areas, just four experienced more job losses than job gains from 2007-2017 \u2014 and all of them are in Ontario (Peterborough, Greater Sudbury, Thunder Bay and London). Among the large urban areas that had some growth, St. Catharines-Niagara and Windsor had the lowest and third lowest growth rates, respectively. In other words, of the seven large urban areas with the weakest job growth, six were in Ontario.\nOf course, green shoots should be celebrated, but we should not lose sight of how much pain the past decade has produced and how many families still struggle with the consequences. What Ontarians need is more action from their government to spur economic growth, entrepreneurship and job creation. Not more press releases claiming credit for the brief uptick in growth over the past 18 months.\nBen Eisen is director of the Fraser Institute\u2019s Ontario Prosperity Initiative."}

Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), filed a congressional bill to regulate marijuana like alcohol, numbered H.R. 420.\nAlso last month, Minnesota state lawmakers introduced a marijuana legalization bill designated as HF 420.\nIn California, the first move to establish statewide medical cannabis regulations was through 2003 legislation numbered SB 420.\nIn 2017, a Rhode Island senator introduced bill to legalize marijuana that was designated as S 420.\nAnd back on Capitol Hill, the first House vote on an amendment to prevent the Department of Justice from interfering with state medical cannabis laws was via 2003's Roll Call 420.\nThe federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong - plain and simple. Too many lives have been wasted and too many economic opportunities have been missed. It\u2019s time for Congress to respect the will of the voters in Oregon and nationwide, who are demanding common-sense drug policies.\nNORML Political Director Justin Strekal called the new bill \"a thoughtful and thorough approach to how the federal government could ultimately end prohibition.\"\n\u201cHailing from the first state to decriminalize marijuana back in 1973, Senator Wyden has a unique and much-needed perspective that his colleagues in the nation\u2019s upper chamber would be wise to follow,\u201d he said.\nAside from S.420, which would also authorize regulations on packaging and labeling of cannabis products and apply alcohol advertising guidelines to the product, Wyden introduced two separate pieces of marijuana legislation in the Senate this week.\nOne of the bills, S.421, seeks to \"reduce the gap between Federal and State marijuana policy.\" It proposes a number of changes such as exempting state-legal marijuana activity from the CSA, allowing banking access for cannabis companies, eliminating advertising prohibitions, expunging criminal records, shielding immigrants from deportation over marijuana and allowing Department of Veterans Affairs doctors to issue medical cannabis recommendations.\nThe other piece of legislation, S.422, would exempt state-legal cannabis businesses from the federal provision known as 280(E), which prevents them from taking normal business tax deductions that are available to operators in other industries.\nThis third bill is the only one of Wyden's new proposals that comes with initial cosponsors.

{"idx": "8906", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: We are experiencing the most dramatic shift in the nature of business and work since the industrial revolution. The traditional management model is based on the premise that large organizations are about bringing together large numbers of people in central locations and then organizing their work. In the last 15 years with the rise of the Internet and electronic technology we are seeing the rise of mass collaboration and globalization. The premise that large numbers of people are gathered in one place is no longer true.\nThe challenge now is how to organize large numbers of people who are not centralized or operating in the context of one enterprise. More and more managers are facing situations where they are responsible for the work of people who do not report to them and may not even be in their organizations. So, management models based on central planning and hierarchical organization are no longer working.\nMass collaboration is making decentralization efficient. We have the examples of the Wikipedia and the operating program, Linux. 20 years ago nobody would have thought that those two products, which are not centrally planned and where nobody is organizing the work, could ever be done. This may be the model for how organizations work.\nCollective learning needs to replace central planning as the foundation of strategy, and self-organization of knowledge workers needs to replace the hierarchical organization of workers. This requires new management models.In my work today I am a management-team coach and a facilitator. These two roles are fundamental enablers to make this shift successfully. In order to make this change, we have to change the fundamental protocols and processes of how we work on a day-to-day basis. Two things have to happen.\nOne, meetings have to change. Organizations typically engage in one style of meeting format: the committee style meeting. It is based on the premise that a good debate will lead to a good solution. All too often it leads to least-common-denominator solutions and in fast-changing times we need the best solutions. Organizations need other options for how to get together. We often need a meeting in which dialogue rather than debate is the foundation. This requires that executives learn to become skilled facilitators to ensure conversation happens at a different level.\nOrganizations need to tap into their collective learning. When organizations do this, they can move far faster than through traditional debate-style meetings. The most untapped resource in America today is the collective knowledge of its workers. It\u2019s all fully paid for. What organizations lack are processes to tap into it. A hierarchical organization is a tremendous obstacle.\nThe second change organizations have to make is the switch from traditional management to learn-and-collaborate management. This is a radical change in the role of the leader. Leaders are more important than ever, but they are no longer bosses.The idea that we can entrust a tremendous amount of authority to give orders to workers and then construct compliance procedures to ensure those orders are carried out is becoming dysfunctional because no one individual can process what is happening out there in this fast changing market.\nOrganizations are going to learn that if they don\u2019t have quick access to their collective knowledge, they are not going to be able to keep up with the market, the competition. This is another reason that we cannot rely on the smarts of the bosses. The smartest organizations are not those with the smartest people, but those with the quickest access to their collective knowledge. Bosses no longer have to be concerned about looking smart or being the most intelligent in the room. Leaders will quickly realize their role is to quickly get access to the know-how of their highly knowledgeable workers."}

{"idx": "8909", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The \"homosexual sitcom\" has become something of a subgenre in the last decade-and-a-half. With shows like Will and Grace, The New Normal, Glee, and Modern Family normalizing depictions of homosexuality on television, the furor over Ellen Degeneres coming out of the closet seems ever further away.\nBritish television has embraced this new paradigm with a totality that perhaps goes beyond American programming. Nonetheless, there are always new frontiers to explore. In an interesting move, British network ITV has begun production on Vicious, a sitcom revolving around a bitter homosexual couple slouching their way into their golden years. In a massive coup, ITV has managed to cast two of Britain's greatest thespians in the main roles: Sirs Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi.\nVariety reports that ITV has signed Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi to headline the upcoming comedy Vicious. The series will be penned by former Family Guy writer-producer Gary Janetti, who previously helped head Will and Grace. The show will be overseen by producer Ed Bye and will also star Frances De La Tour (Madame Maxine of the Harry Potter series).\nOriginally titled Vicious Old Queens, the show will concern a homosexual couple who have lived together in London for 50 years. Long since retired, the duo have taken to a life of boring hobbies and petty arguments. Just when it seems that the two have finally had enough of each other, the arrival of a young man to their apartment building upsets the established routine of their lives.\nThe star power of the attached leads is undeniable. Ian McKellen barely needs any introduction \u2013 a distinguished veteran of British theater, he went on to become a cult figure with his star-making turns in The Lord of the Rings and X-Men. Though his career has not been quite as flashy as McKellen's, Derek Jacobi is every bit as accomplished. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Laurence Olivier and has enjoyed a long, varied career in film and television. Readers may recognize him from The King's Speech, Gladiator, and Doctor Who. Both McKellen and Jacobi have been knighted for their contributions to British drama.\nThe overwhelming bona fides of both McKellen and Jacobi are only part of why their casting is such a boon for Vicious. Their own personal experiences will no doubt color their performances \u2013 both men are openly gay and have lived with longtime partners for some years. McKellen in particular has been a vocal proponent for LGBT rights and has been recognized by British gay advocacy groups.\nOf course, this all leads up to what may be the most important point of all: These are two very serious dramatic actors who are no doubt about to play spectacularly against type. Granted, Ian McKellen has been known to lightly lampoon his previous accomplishments (his hosting appearance on Saturday Night Live riffed wonderfully on his Gandalf and Magneto roles), but neither he or Jacobi are known for outright comedic performances.\nThis raises the question as to whether the duo will be able to shift gears for a full-on screwball comedy \u2013 and also as to what kind of comedy Vicious will end up being. One imagines that the show will have to walk a fairly narrow path to avoid being either too dry or falling the other direction into ridiculous camp. It's certainly one to watch develop \u2013 if only for the potential of its dynamite leading cast.\nThough Vicious does not yet have a firm release date, it is expected to air late in 2013."}

According to AFA, sexual predators could take advantage of the policy, thereby putting women and children at risk.\n\"This proves our point and it's what we've been saying all along,\" says Walker Wildmon of AFA. \"Allowing men free access to women's restrooms and changing rooms is a dangerous policy.\"\nWildmon adds that it's nice to see someone other than conservatives being open about their concerns over such matters. Dillard Smith is a Democrat.\n\"We met with Target in May,\" says Wildmon, \"and they respectfully heard our concerns and heard us out, but they refused to change their policy and thus, our boycott has continued and it's still going strong.\""}
{"idx": "8914", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Doctors have long known that separating families and other traumatic events can damage children's well-being. More recent research has shed some light on how that may happen: Severe early adversity may cause brain changes and \"toxic stress,\" resulting in lasting psychological and physical health problems.\nA \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy announced this spring by the Trump Administration has separated 2,300 children from the adults they were traveling with and sent them to shelters and foster homes across the country, according to the government. The administration has 30 days to reunite families, but it remains unclear whether it can meet that deadline.\nHere's what evidence shows this kind of separation can do and how some experts think immigrant children may be at risk.\nStress is a normal response to challenging or threatening circumstances that cause the brain to trigger the body's \"fight or flight\" mode. Stress hormones and chemicals are released that increase heart rate, blood pressure, alertness and energy levels.\nLevels typically return to normal when the threat passes.\nWhen the threat is ongoing \u2014 a result of things like war, famine, poverty, natural disasters, family discord or neighborhood violence \u2014 the stress system may remain on high alert, sometimes triggering anxiety, behavior problems, stomach aches, sleep problems and other mental and physical symptoms.\nExperts believe that contact with a loving, nurturing parent or caregiver can help children weather stress and reduce chances for lasting ill effects. A recent U.S. study of toddlers from families living in poverty is an example. Youngsters who had a strong parent relationship had lower stress-hormone levels when they arrived at a clinic to get vaccinations than those without that parent buffer.\nScientists increasingly believe that persistent stress, particularly when there's no nurturing parent to help kids cope, can cause stress hormones and internal inflammatory markers to smolder at elevated levels, raising risks for later heart disease, diabetes and other health problems.\nThe science is not settled, but some studies also have shown that persistent stress may alter brain structure in regions affecting emotions and regulating behavior. Imaging studies have found these regions are smaller than usual in severely traumatized children.\nHarvard University neuroscientist Charles Nelson says children younger than 3, with rapidly developing brains, are most at risk for the toxic effects of ongoing stress. In his imaging studies, school-aged Romanian orphans sent to live with foster families had brains with less gray matter than orphans sent to nurturing foster homes before age 2.\nCentral American children arriving with their families at the southern U.S. border have already endured the trauma of leaving their homes, some after violence or other threats, and faced the additional trauma of an arduous journey north, Nelson said Wednesday. \"That may increase their susceptibility to the hazards of separation at the border,\" he said.\nNelson said the images he's seen of U.S. detention centers housing children remind him of his research with Romanian children. In a recent research newsletter, Nelson wrote, \"The lessons we learned then taught us that housing children in institution-like settings, with rotating shifts of caregivers and unfavorable ratios of caregivers to children, may cause severe and permanent damage to their minds and bodies.\"\n\"This is what science has taught us about separation,\" he said Wednesday.\nIn 2017, a year before the separation policy was announced, the American Academy of Pediatrics advised against holding migrant children in detention centers and said they should receive health care and treatment to \"support their well-being.\"\nThe academy and several mental health groups recently denounced"}

Among them are the city of Sacramento and Sacramento County, whose bans went into effect this year.\nSacramento County Supervisor Phil Serna, who, like Murray, is hoping voters will pass Proposition 67 to uphold the statewide plastic bag ban, says the local effort is aimed at keeping the fluttering plastic menaces from constantly clogging storm drains, littering parks and ponds and getting caught in the gears of recycling machinery.\nOn a daily basis, Serna is reminded that the cursed bags don\u2019t decompose and can litter and despoil a landscape for years.\nLed by Hilex Poly Co., a plastic bag maker based in South Carolina, plastic bag makers have raised $5.135 million to block California\u2019s statewide ban on the single-use grocery bags in votes on the Nov. 8 ballot.

The same can be said of bestselling guru prescriptives.\nMalcolm Gladwell's new book What the Dog Saw, a compilation of some of his favorite New Yorker pieces, has drawn both praise and criticism. Personally, I'm not a big Gladwell fan. Shoot me. I'm told he's an interesting person. And he knows how to tell a good anecdote. But, at the risk of oversimplifying my critique of his work ... he oversimplifies.\nThe general thesis of Blink, for example, was \"trust your gut ... except when you shouldn't.\" Okay ... but why can you trust your gut sometimes, but not others? What does that tell us about what \"gut\" instinct really is? And what does that mean in terms of how we process information in the world? And what do we do with that knowledge? The really interesting points are left dangling. Why? I don't know, but I suspect it's because they're complex and not easily summarized ... and might muddy the simple and easily-grasped ideas or conclusions that are a trademark of Gladwell's work.\nIf I'm not a fan of Gladwell, it's because I want to see robust logic behind an argument, depth to its exploration, and acknowledgment of the complexities and contradictions it may entail. Simple, neat answers don't appeal to me, because they don't resonate with what I've experienced in the world. But clearly, I'm an outlier in that regard.\nJudging from the sales of not only Gladwell's books, but the plethora of \"3 step,\" \"7 habits,\" \"9 insights\" and other success-formula books on personal and business improvement, there's an almost ravenous hunger in the world for simple answers on how things work and how to get the game right. And that hunger has only gotten more intense as the world has gotten more complex.\nIt's an interesting phenomenon. Surely one part of our brain knows that the world, or even the world of business, is more complex than the raft of simple, success-formula books promises. And yet, like a woman who, despite multiple failed affairs, convinces herself that this married man will surely leave his wife, we ... or at least a good number of us ... keep buying the fantasy. We keep being drawn to simple-sounding answers and solutions--to the tune of almost $13 billion a year. Even when, or perhaps because, they don't pan out to be true, as a writer for The Economist pointed out in a recent column.\n\"The Three Habits ... of Highly Irritating Management Gurus\" takes the writers of those \"3-step\" and \"7-habits\" books to task on several fronts. First, for repackaging stale ideas as breakthrough insights. Second, for using seemingly \"model firm\" anecdotes to prove their points without a lot of rigorous research--anecdotes that often prove embarrassingly untrue several years down the road. And third, for ... well, peddling those \"three habit\" success-formula lists and prescriptives.\nBut \"the most irritating thing of all about management gurus,\" the author writes, is that \"their failures only serve to stoke demand for their services. If management could indeed be reduced to a few simple principles, then we would have no need for management thinkers. But the very fact that it defies easy solutions, leaving managers in a perpetual state of angst, means that there will always"}
{"idx": "8929", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Aside from the obvious comparisons to Air, or any other European down-tempo impresario, they wear their affection for pure pop sound producing on their parkas.\nMelody A.M., the debut CD from Norwegian electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp has a variety of uses. As the title implies, this is not a bad choice to pop into the stereo first thing in the morning. Listen to this while you're waking up, brushing your teeth, or on your way to work. It won't yell at you or make any quick, unsettling movements. It's also a fitting choice as the last disc you listen to in the morning -- the sort of morning that comes after an intentionally sleepless night. It's medicinal qualities make it an excellent choice to turn on as you wind down and fall asleep, just as the sun is coming up. Given R\u00f6yksopp's origins in the far Northern latitudes of Norway, perhaps this isn't surprising. In a land where summer days are absurdly long, and winter nights are frighteningly dark, it helps to have some sort of musical chronological indicator to help plow through bouts of seasonal affected disorder.\nR\u00f6yksopp is made up of two electronic musical tailors, Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge, who grew up together in Troms\u00f8, Norway. They shared a childhood friendship, an admitted fascination with Burt Bacharach and an affinity for Norwegian easy listening music (whatever that is). What they've created is a fantastic chill-out album that manages to be warm and cozy, not to mention unique. There's no doubt that many of the tracks on Melody A.M. are destined to appear on all of this year's finest down-temp electronica compilations. That's terrific news for R\u00f6yksopp, as it inevitably generates a fresh round of interest in their lush album in the months to come.\nAside from the obvious comparisons to Air, or any other European down-tempo impresario, they wear their affection for pure pop sound producing on their parkas. In fact, \"So Easy\" the first track on Melody A.M. borrows unabashedly from Bobby Vinton's \"Blue on Blue\". But even if you couldn't hear the distorted notes, you'd know that it did.\nIt's almost as if Brundtland and Berge are trying to build an electronic version of the Brill Building, which fell out of favor when the British Invasion overtook American pop charts in the mid-'60s. Those invaders stormed our shores armed with what was then the dregs of American music -- turn of the century blues that no one in the U.S. of A. was listening to. Now the Norwegians are invading, this time with a truckload of sweet and sour pop tunes that fell out of favor two generations ago. Their tunes are built on seemingly simple rhythms and melodic hooks. But listen closely and you'll hear a continuously evolving composition that demands your attention until the end of the song.\nThe aforementioned title track, \"So Easy\", exemplifies this idea. It begins with the synthetic sound you might find in the introductory screen to a video game. Then marching rhythm kicks in, reminiscent of military parade high-stepping. I may have spent too much time living in Northern California, but the transitions in the tune sound like a bong being cleared. Not that you need to be medicated to appreciate the richness here.\n\"Eple"}

The firms acquired the assets, such as people and buildings, as well as the existing customer accounts, but arranged for RBS to continue running the business on the bank's IT infrastructure until WorldPay had its own.\nWorldPay processes billions of payments to merchants via point of sale methods such as credit and debit cards every year. It processes the payment from the point of sale, authorises it, and transfers the money to the merchant from the bank or credit card company.\nThis month, the company will make its co-located datacentres fully operational, with the aim to fully split from RBS\u2019s IT infrastructure and stand on its own two feet in October 2013.\nWorldPay CTO Erik Toivonen, who joined the company in January 2011, said WorldPay had an agreement with RBS to keep the operation running on the bank's IT until WorldPay had its own. This required the creation of an IT infrastructure from scratch.\nToivonen said 149 IT workers transferred from RBS as part of the acquisition, but none of these were infrastructure specialists. The technology team had software engineering and project management skills, but did not have many of the skills it really needed, such as datacentre people, network administrators, security experts and technology operations professionals, he added.\nDue to the security levels required by WorldPay, which transacts the banking details of millions of people, it decided to build its own IT infrastructure within a co-located datacentre owned by SunGard.\nTo help it plan the IT to sit within the datacentres, WorldPay used the services of consultancy Xceed Group, which was a supplier to RBS. Part of this was what is known as the discovery phase, where WorldPay had to establish what it needed to run the processing service by establishing what the current system uses.\nToivonen said WorldPay decided to build its own infrastructure in the SunGard datacentre shell because it would have been difficult to get the security guarantees it wanted from an outsourced datacentre.\n\u201cA high level of security is required to transact millions of payments every day. There is a huge risk if there is a problem, and getting a supplier to sign up to that level of risk is difficult. We thought, \u2018we own the risk, let\u2019s do it ourselves',\u201d he said.\nThe company has outsourced certain parts of the infrastructure, such as security, although the internal team retains overall control.\nThe co-located datacentre houses the company\u2019s internal operational IT, as well as its customer-facing payment processing engine. Transactions are processed in both datacentres, but as well as having their own back-up, each has the capacity to transact all payments if it needs to in the event of a problem with one. There is no single point of failure.\nIn February 2013, WorldPay will move its entire staff computing infrastructure, such as desktop services and telephony, into the datacentre. The company is using thin client hardware and virtualised desktops.\nToivonen said the processing technology will be moved in stages, with the aim to split from RBS in October 2013.\nInitially, the company will move the entire volume of the processing to one of the two RBS datacentres, with back-up in the second.

The Fed had raised rates four times last year and a total of nine times since December 2015.\nThe Fed's pause in credit tightening is a response, in part, to slowdowns in the U.S. and global economies. It says that while the job market remains strong, \"growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.\"\nSome Fed watchers say they think the next rate move could be a cut later this year if the economy slows as much as some fear it might. The policymakers' statement stressed, as they have in recent weeks, that given sluggish growth and continually mild inflation, the Fed \"will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to make\" to rates.\nAll of which suggests that the Fed may recognize that it went too far after it met in December. At that meeting, the Fed approved a fourth rate hike for 2018 and projected two additional rate increases in 2019. Chairman Jerome Powell also said he thought the balance sheet reduction would be on \"automatic pilot.\"\nBut after the December turmoil, the Fed in January began sending a more comforting message. At an economic conference soon after New Year's, Powell stressed that the Fed would be \"flexible\" and \"patient\" in raising rates \u2014 a word he and other policymakers have invoked repeatedly since \u2014 and \"wouldn't hesitate\" to change course if necessary."}

{"idx": "8945", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Lynch said that landing physical, big-bodied defensive linemen who can move, especially on the third day of the draft, is hard, and teams can't be too picky when they find one.\nMore than that, any defensive lineman the 49ers bring in this year is going to have to beat out a talented veteran on a defensive line that includes three former first-round picks.\nThat was a theme on Saturday for Lynch and Kyle Shanahan, who had to be more strategic with their draft picks this year than they were a year ago when the roster was threadbare and they were merely filling slots at a lot of positions. That is, there are simply fewer openings now versus 2017.\nStreet, for instance, could find a better opportunity next season if the 49ers don't pick up the fifth-year option on Arik Armstead's rookie contract. The team has until Thursday to decide on Armstead and another 2015 first-round pick, guard Laken Tomlinson. No decision has been made yet on either player.\nWatch the Wolfpack weight room go crazy as N.C. State senior defensive tackle Kentavius Street squats a massive 700 pounds in a video posted to YouTube on July 20, 2017. The 49ers picked Street in the fourth round of the NFL draft on April 28, 2018.\n\"I would say that perhaps last year was a little more role specific,\" Lynch said of the team's draft plan. \"'Hey, we need someone to play the slot. Let's identify these traits.' This year, we kind of went more to, 'Hey, we want some cornerstones. We want some players that are going to be here for a long time.'\"\n\u25aa Fifth round: D.J. Reed, cornerback, Kansas State. The 5-foot-9 Reed will push K'Waun Williams for playing time at nickel cornerback. He also was a special-teams standout in college and scored a touchdown on both a punt return and a kickoff last year.\n\u25aa Sixth round: Marcell Harris, safety, Florida. As it stands now, the 49ers don't have much depth behind Jaquiski Tartt at strong safety. Harris missed the 2017 season with an Achilles tear suffered in the summer but should be ready by training camp. \"He's a thumper at the safety position, a guy who has a presence on the field,\" Lynch said.\n\u25aa Seventh round: Jullian Taylor, defensive end, Temple. Like Street, Taylor is a bigger-bodied player with good quickness that the 49ers envision playing at two spots, big end and defensive tackle. He, too, suffered an ACL tear. It occurred in 2016, and he played a near full slate of games last season.\n\u25aa Seventh round, Richie James, receiver, Middle Tennessee State. James set school records in receiving yards, catches and touchdowns despite playing just two and a half seasons. His 2017 season was cut short by a broken collarbone. However, he caught more than 100 passes the two seasons prior, and Shanahan and Lynch said they liked the ferocity with which he plays. Shanahan said James likely would start out at the X receiver spot, which is where Marquise Goodwin plays.\nA year ago, seven different rookies who were selected on Day 3 of the draft played a total of 2,400 snaps for the 49ers.

I rather thought she was talking about the Ancient World, but she was talking about old people: she had lived in a Greek village for some years.\nShe was right: the spell worked. I became very attached to my husband's four uncles: Evangelos, George One and George Two, and Philopoemis. All had the relaxed charm of survivors who have struggled through hard times, but have ultimately achieved their goals, the most important of which involved doing their best by God and the Family.\nThey had also retained great vitality and humour: sometimes, after hearing their tales of the past, of war, poverty and death, I wondered how.\nFor them I had the value of novelty, as I was the first foreign woman they had ever met.\nMy relationship with old women, particularly that with my mother-in-law, the redoubtable Aphrodite, was often more complex. But I was still in a fair way to be magicked, and now I am sorry that the old people I became so fond of are no more. I miss them.\nBut then last Christmas I met Yiayia Iphigenia, my daughter-in-law Katerina's grandmother, and was enchanted all over again, by both name and person.\nIn a scarcely more palatable account, the goddess Artemis whisked her away, leaving a sacrificial deer in her place. Artemis then decreed that Iphigenia should be an acolyte at one of her island temples, where her specific job was to kill any man that set foot on the beach. Of course one fine day her brother inevitably happens along. Lots of pity and terror then ensue.\nI learned that there had also been ample sorrow and trauma in the life of the modern Iphigenia.\nIt was a bright winter's day when we visited Yiayia Iphigenia in her village. She was sitting outside in the sun, as the old anywhere love to do. Long widowed, she was dressed in black, and was meticulously turned out: headscarf, apron, the whole traditional outfit.\nIphigenia is not sure how old she is, for in her day girls were not usually registered at birth; boys were, for purposes of later compulsory national service. She thinks she is about 86.\nIphigenia's was a hard life in anyone's book. Orphaned at six, she was then at the mercy of her aunts. Shunted from house to house, she was often beaten, and when with one aunt was forced to sleep outside with the dog. 'At least the dog kept me warm,' she said.\nHer memories, too, are those of pain, war, and loss. She married at 17, no doubt by proxenio, arrangement, and two of her babies died. When the next baby happened along, Iphigenia decided to test her faith via an old custom: she left the baby by the side of the road, and the first person to pick her up became the godparent.\nIphigenia had not a shadow of doubt that this baby would grow and flourish. And so she did: she grew up to become Katerina's mother.\nOne of the many gifts Greece has given my three sons is that of respect and understanding of the aged. It was obvious that both Iphigenia and Niko enjoyed their conversation, and he listened carefully when she gave him advice. 'Never complain,' she instructed, 'and be thrifty:"}

This main conclusion, the need to secure supply of oil products in the projected low carbon future and the potential risks for EU jobs, technological leadership and carbon leakage associated with an accelerated disengagement of the refining industry in the EU, are outlined in the \u201cContribution to EU energy pathways to 2050\u201d, published by EUROPIA, the European Petroleum Industry Association, representing the EU refining and marketing industry, together with key recommendations for the Commission Energy Roadmap.\nThe report, building upon elements articulated in previous EUROPIA White Papers on Refining1 and on Fuelling Transport2 and on the \u201cCommission Staff Working Paper on refining and the supply of petroleum products in the EU3\u201d, is the contribution of the European Refining and marketing industry to the upcoming DG Energy \u201cRoadmap for a low-carbon energy system by 2050\u201d.\nEUROPIA stresses in this document the great uncertainties that modelling the economy so far into the future carries, and emphasises that a roadmap looking so far into the future can only provide a strategic direction and not impose a single specific pathway. EUROPIA proposes a number of factors which should be considered when developing the Energy Roadmap 2050.\nThe report outlines demand trends to 2030 and 2050 which show that, despite potential declines of 11% in the demand for oil products by 2030 and up to 50% by 2050, refined products will still be needed in the EU with a share for oil close to 30% of primary energy demand in the EU by 2030 and potentially 20% by 2050. There remain significant technical and economic challenges to replace oil in many sectors of the economy. These scenarios nevertheless imply a significant reduction in EU refining capacity, although there is a great uncertainty as to the depth and the pace of the economy\u2019s transition and the industry\u2019s restructuring.\nThe report presents an analysis of the potential implications for the EU refining industry and the consequences of its potential decline for both the supply of essential oil products within the EU and the EU economy. It highlights the substantial risk of leaving many regions and probably countries without indigenous refineries which could result into a loss of security of supply through reduced logistics. It also indicates other potential negative impacts: a loss of EU technology leadership in fuel product specifications; emissions transfer and carbon leakage out of the EU; direct losses to the EU economy of \u20ac 240B taxes and duties, and of \u20ac 30B gross value added of the industry, over 1million jobs in the sector and other related sectors such as petrochemicals, and a major reduction in the distribution and marketing systems putting at risks the EU internal market for transport fuels.\nThe continued need in all scenarios for oil products in the EU beyond 2030 towards 2050 means that it is in the EU\u2019s interest to implement policy and legislation that do not impose burdens on the EU refining industry which will force it to cut capacity faster than market demand decrease, but instead maintain the viability of the EU domestic refining sector"}

Kanye West. Guitarist Ben Little says incessantly listening to the rapper\u2019s sonically abrasive Yeezus shaped the stripped-back, primal-minded change of direction for his band on Boy King.\nWest is not the first artist you would think of as sharing kinship with Wild Beasts, who are known for their fragile, literate, effervescent indie music.\n\u201cPut it this way: I think he\u2019d be a nightmare to have a drink with, but I do think he\u2019s a talented musician,\u201d says Little.\nFollowing 2014\u2019s keyboard-\u00adheavy, politically perceptive Present Tense, Boy King marks a pronounced change of direction for the feted British indie scenesters. Lyrically preoccupied with matters of the carnal variety, the macho message is matched by a brazenly leaner sound, with sleazy guitar crackles and slippery synths underlaid by an infectiously swaggering sense of groove.\nThis new egocentrism is a direct response to meeting \u2013 and trying to win over \u2013 the wider, increasingly far-flung audiences Wild Beasts encountered on their last tour, which included their first gigs in Asia.\nThe material for Boy King was conceived after a move to a new studio space in London, during a full year of demoing. However the sweaty sense of testosterone truly took shape after they moved to Dallas, Texas, to record with John Congleton, the Grammy Award-winning producer known for his work with dozens of artists, including St Vincent, Swans, and The War on Drugs.\n\u201cIn London ... we were micromanaging, over-demoing, and a lot of the songs had different versions, slower versions \u2013 we could have essentially made a completely different record,\u201d says Little.\nThis newly unambiguous musical and lyrical approach is dividing fans and critics. Wild Beasts have built their reputation on a lofty sense of intelligence \u2013 deeply textured art-rock canvases, marked by sensitive, prescient observations delivered in frontman Hayden Thorpe\u2019s falsetto frills. Many fans still hold 2009\u2019s Mercury Prize-nominated Two Dancers as a high-water mark.\nBoy King\u2019s embrace of rock\u2019s simpler, reductive heyday \u2013 as well as Yeezus, Little rediscovered The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin while the album was being made \u2013 is seen by some as a betrayal of the band\u2019s bountiful promise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s splitting opinion \u2013 there are a few reviews out there that are taking a swipe at us, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d says Little.\nWith a consistent critical hype that perhaps outweighs their commercial potential, Boy King definitely catches the band at an interesting crossroads \u2013 the message appears to be that Wild Beasts had to grow up before they could make a record this playfully juvenile.\nLittle just turned 30, and is not entirely happy about entering his fourth decade.\nThe future of the band \u2013 and, indeed, a continuing career in music during these increasingly fragmented times \u2013 appears to be at the forefront of the musicians\u2019 minds.\nWild Beasts formed when school\u00ad\u00admates Little and Thorpe met in rural Cumbria.

High-visibility crosswalks, directional signage for cyclists, and advisory signs for drivers should improve safety and provide students a convenient bike connection to the Bryant Street Bike Boulevard and improved safe access to the bike parking area for Jordan Middle School students.\nNarrower car lanes on Middlefield and a simplified centerline striping will aim to calm speeding and better vehicle turning movement. Speed data will be collected and analyzed before and after the changes to determine their effectiveness, Chief Transportation Official Joshuah Mello said June 9 at a public meeting on the road changes at City Hall.\nTo address cars that typically speed and pass aggressively and unsafely on the right at Middlefield and Kingsley Avenue, the city plans to narrow lanes, paint cross-hatched areas near the intersection, and install 6-inch-tall \"traffic buttons\" in the pavement, which would improve safety for traffic turning on to Middlefield from Kingsley.\nA similar cross-hatched section of roadway will be installed near the Walter Hays Elementary School driveway to prevent cars from passing, and a new right-turn lane will be striped on Middlefield to let drivers entering the school to pull to the curb and keep the road clear.\nNarrower lanes will also slow traffic near the Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo and the Lucie Stern Community Center. To shorten crossing distances and increase visibility for pedestrians, a concrete bulb-out and crosswalk will be added to the north side of Kingsley.\nSeale Avenue at Middlefield will also gain a high-visibility crosswalk.\nIn addition, two new dedicated left-turn lanes will be added from both directions of Middlefield onto Embarcadero Road. The traffic signal at the intersection will be adjusted in the future, Mello said.\nOther changes north of University Avenue at Middlefield, where residents have called for fewer lanes, will be addressed in a separate phase, Mello said.\nMore information and renderings of the project are available online at cityofpaloalto.org/transportation.\n"}

This is a subject that nearly 13 years after the Sept. 11 attacks still has New Yorkers on edge.\nBratton has been friendly toward the Port Authority police, which patrols the World Trade Center, a site Kelly fought to control.\nThere have been at least four meetings on security matters -- i.e., terrorism -- between the agencies' brass, including Bratton and John Miller, deputy commissioner for intelligence.\nAfter a N.J. teenager slipped through a hole in a construction fence at 4 a.m. last week and rode an elevator to near the top of 1 World Trade Center, giving the Port Authority a black eye, the NYPD and Port Authority police were patrolling the area in tandem at 4 a.m. the following day.\n\"It's all done in the spirit of cooperation and sharing information,\" said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely about the two agencies. \"The attitude has entirely changed.\"\nThen there is the FBI, which Kelly also fought as commissioner. That's trickier.\nPerhaps the most notable bone in the bureau's throat was Kelly's decision to station NYPD detectives overseas in terrorism hot spots, where the FBI has jurisdiction. Miller spent three years as a bureau spokesman in Washington, and may be more sympathetic to the bureau's concerns.\nYet Bratton is preparing to travel to Jordan and Israel, where the NYPD has stationed detectives. Word is that he and Miller are evaluating each overseas posting. For at least the next year, the detectives are expected to remain in place, but Bratton and Miller eventually will have to determine how effective the overseas detectives have been.\nIn 2013, at a forum at the 92nd Street Y, Kelly acknowledged they had produced not a single lead about a potential terrorist attack on New York City.\nBut that's only part of the story. Are the detectives providing information to Police Plaza not found in the overseas newspapers? Are they providing insights from overseas contacts that may help prevent a future attack?\nOne top department official who spoke anonymously to openly discuss the program says London and Tel Aviv \"are solid gold. But,\" he adds, \"are other places just boondoggles? Were detectives sent there because those places are sources of potential information?\" Or to satisfy his ego?\nNow let's turn to transparency.\nIn Bratton's first term, the Police Foundation paid his consultant friends. One was George Kelling, whom Bratton called his \"intellectual mentor.\" In 1994, the foundation, a non-profit, paid Kelling $25,000 to write a report on the then-ubiquitous squeegee men.

The document is part of a series of short papers meant to support ongoing budget deliberations in the Bundestag. The findings eventually will be made public, the agency said, but only once budget negotiations are complete.\nIntegrating all required features into the Puma, made by a consortium of Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, will take until 2029 if similar efforts of the past are any guide, according to the report.\nPreparations for sustaining the Marder beyond its envisioned end of life in 2025 should include ensuring that enough spare parts are available. That has been a notorious problem for the German armed forces, wreaking havoc on readiness rates across the board in recent years.\nThe debate over a new German weapons-capable drone showcases mistrust by some politicians in Berlin toward U.S.-made defense equipment.\nAnalysts report deployment-readiness rates of 48 percent in 2016 and 43 percent in 2017 for Puma vehicles, though they acknowledge that the weapon is brand new and only now in the initial delivery phase.\nAdditionally, the Army has reported a lack of \u201csystem stability\u201d of the Pumas, according to auditors. The weapon is known to often malfunction during training, and the failure source remains elusive.\nMeanwhile, auditors note with \u201cgrave concern\u201d that the Marder fleet\u2019s availability rate also is trending downward.\nThe Defence Ministry already has several programs underway to improve the Puma and retrofit vehicles already delivered. But critical gaps remain, including a system offering improved situational awareness for vehicle operators and a camouflage feature that would reduce the vehicle\u2019s radar signature, the ministry told lawmakers in a confidential report in April.\nThe price tag for the outstanding capabilities is expected to lie in the hundreds of millions of euros.\nDefense officials announced in April that 35 Marder tanks are in line to get the anti-tank weapon MELLS, though a fleetwide program for all of the 1970s-era tanks also is under consideration. A portion of the legacy vehicles are slated to be part of Germany\u2019s contribution to a NATO Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, the ministry said.\nThe entire Puma fleet will also get the MELLS tank-killing weapon, eventually. In their confidential report, however, officials predicted a yearlong delay, from March 2019 to the second quarter of 2020. Following integration testing in early summer, the government expects to request money for the retrofitting from the Bundestag later this year."}

Hold the smirk a minute, researchers say. They claim that a powerful behavior called \"licensing\" is at work.\nIt occurs when people allow themselves to indulge by doing something positive first. So at the burger joint, having a diet soda makes the meal's calories and cholesterol seem OK.\nResearchers see the \"licensing effect\" in many realms, from marketing to fighting bad habits. They add that it works best if people don't know how it works.\n\"Doing something good, if you like, lets you do something bad,\" said Ravi Dhar, the director of the Center for Consumer Insights at the Yale School of Management in New Haven, Conn.\nHaving seen themselves as generous, they allowed themselves to be selfish, according to Dhar. \"The general idea is that choices signal the kind of person you are.\"\n\"Normally, people are consistent and committed to their self-image,\" said Dale Miller, a psychology professor at the Stanford Business School in Palo Alto, Calif. \"With licensing, the first act doesn't commit you, it liberates you.\"\nLicensing effects also show up at charity balls, galas and auctions, said Mark Rubin, co-owner of Signature Auctions, a New York company that specializes in charity fundraisers.\n\"At these events you have people who really want to support the charity, so the perceived value of what an item is worth becomes more than the actual value,\" Rubin said. \"I'd say licensing is probably a good 30 to 35 percent component of why things go for the price they go for.\"\nMiller's experiments in moral licensing also turned up a downside, in which managers who've declared their lack of bias in hiring license themselves to be prejudiced. Miller worries, for example, about job vacancies that require women and minorities to be included among the finalists. He suspects that the practice makes it easier for some managers to choose neither in the end.\nLicensing also can work against charity if people feel licensed to spurn the Salvation Army, for example, because they've already given to United Way.\nUnderstanding how licensing works, Khan said, is liberating.\n\"You can help people make more virtuous decisions by making them more aware of this effect.\""}

Specifically, she hopes more individuals will contribute to improving the infrastructure and making Flint a model for other urban cities when it comes to taking these steps.\nOne key part in moving forward also involves gaining the trust of the citizens of Flint and making sure the lessons are being learned, Weaver said. Discussion moderator Christy McDonald from WTVS Detroit Public Television stated that 70 percent of people in Flint still don\u2019t trust that they can drink the filtered water. Weaver responded by stressing that implementing replacement infrastructure is the key to restoring faith.\nWhite spoke to the C.S. Mott Foundation\u2019s role in helping to ease the struggling community of Flint. To make the recovery a unified effort, they came up with the \u201cRecover and Rise Initiative,\u201d a $125 million pledge to Flint over the next five years.\nCalley said the building of consensuses is another key to recovery. No one entity such, as the state government or EPA, should be trusted alone. Weaver agreed that it would take collaboration of public and private sectors to move forward, praising the C.S.

Flint citizens are now occupying water distribution jobs and helping the sense of community rise in the city. He reiterated that economic development is key to the prevention of future tragedies.\nWeaver simply stated that the two things she would like most for Flint are pipes and jobs. She added that, if people invest and create partnerships, they could really take advantage of resources such as the land in Flint, using similar developments in Detroit like the RiverWalk as models.\nCalley further stressed the importance of education as necessary for people to get jobs. Retaining population is also a concern for Weaver, as she expressed that most young people who go to college in Flint end up leaving the city.\nWhite added that the C.S.

I\u2019m not sure what Val has in mind, but I\u2019m looking forward to the discussion.\nThe Thermis is nearly finished. I\u2019m a few rows past the first button hole, and I\u2019ve picked out some possible buttons from my rather extensive button stash. The blue ones look great, but they are a little thick and might be annoying so close to my chin. The wooden ones are also thick, though. The designer does use wooden buttons on her Thermis, and I rather like the look, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d prefer to have button holes showing or not, so I\u2019m going to think about it some more today.\nPosted in events, knitting. Tags: buttons, cowls, knitting, knitting group, prayer shawl ministry, prayer shawls on December 29, 2010 by Pam MacKenzie.\nThese gifts, including the Thermis cowl in the top left corner and the pattern underneath it, were part of the package I received in Swap on a Budget this last round.\nAfter finishing my disappointing shrug yesterday, I decided to make 2 things I really want: a dark teal Thermis cowl and my replacement Fair Isle hat. The Thermis cowl is the style I got in my last Swap on a Budget package. You can see the one I got in this picture, along with a copy of the instructions. I like it because it\u2019s such a practical shape: it fits my neck well, fits inside the collar of most of my coats, and it comes up over my chin and lower face when I want it to. And also, I like wearing it indoors when I have the heat turned down at home or when I\u2019m in a grocery store. I wear this pink one several times a week.\nA month ago, when I was coughing a lot, that extra layer of warmth felt particularly good. Now that I\u2019m healed up, I don\u2019t need it so much, but I still enjoy having it. So I got out some Ocean colored Caron Simply Soft, cast on 112, and got to work on the cowl first. It\u2019s going pretty fast. I\u2019m about 8 rows from the place where you stop knitting in the round and start going back and forth so that you can put those buttons on, near the top. I\u2019m thinking this will be a great project to do as a handmade gift in some of my future Swap on a Budget packages.\nThis Thermis cowl is going very quickly. I'm looking forward to wearing it by the end of the week. The color got washed out in this photo; it's actually much richer.\nI chose the Ocean because I have a fair amount of it, and because I use Ocean in the Fair Isle hat. The Pagoda color would probably go better with some of my favorite sweaters because it has more green in it, but I only have four skeins of Pagoda, also given to me in the Swap on a Budget package, and as I don\u2019t know any stores in Central Jersey that are selling it, I want to save it all for a sweater.\nI\u2019m looking forward to finishing this and getting started on the Fair Isle hat.

{"idx": "8982", "prompt": "Continue the following text: By detaining Haniyeh, Israel sent a message that Palestinian cash smuggling is coming to an end.\nIt is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing ever since the international community cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority following Hamas's rise to power earlier this year. Yet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to keep PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza was the first time Israel has actively intervened to stop the money flow. But if the money smuggling has been going on since the spring, why did Israel decide to take action only now? According to government sources, it was simply a case of having accurate intelligence information about what Haniyeh had in his suitcases. The sources said that had Israel known back in July that PA Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar intended to smuggle $20m. into Gaza, they would have taken similar action. But there seems to be more at play than just good intelligence. Diplomatic sources said there was something so audacious in Haniyeh going to Iran, pledging jihad forever and coming back with suitcases full of cash, that Israel simply could not turn a blind eye. Especially since the Gaza cease-fire agreed upon a few weeks ago called for an end to the smuggling, both of arms and cash. And while the international community would be less than tolerant were Israel to take military action in Gaza against rocket fire on Sderot, there would be more understanding in trying to prevent an influx of cash to bolster Hamas. Furthermore, it was clear that the money originated in Iran, and the security establishment is becoming increasingly concerned about the growing connection between Hamas and Iran. Security officials told the cabinet on Sunday that despite the international ban on bank transfers, the money has continued flowing into Gaza. They said that has led to a situation where Hamas's popularity and strength had not declined since the ban went into effect, but the organization was instead feeling a resurgence of confidence. A confident Hamas is not only bad for Israel, but also for PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and his supporters, which indicates that Israel is not the only player in the area that wants to see the money flow stopped. Stopping the flow will be extremely difficult. Although it may be more difficult to walk the money through the Rafah crossing in a suitcase, it can still be smuggled through the tunnels under the Philadelphi Corridor, since a tunnel that can fit arms and ammunition, can also fit suitcases of cash. But by keeping Haniyeh from bringing the money in on Thursday, Israel sent a message that the unhindered flow of cash from Iran into Gaza was coming to an end. Money will still likely make its way through, but from now on it will probably be more difficult - and not only because Israel wants it so, but because Abbas and those loyal to him want it that way as well."}

{"idx": "8984", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Somebody must actually govern. Eight Golden State pros weigh in on what it will take.\nDespite his image as being a guy with ideas - mystical or not - former California Gov. Jerry Brown used to immerse himself in the intricate details of the budget. He even refused to hire a budget director so he could manage the process himself. The goal was, in his words, to \"innovate.\"\nRonald Reagan, by contrast, wanted to innovate from a big-picture standpoint. He hewed to core beliefs and then, like a corporate chief executive, left the details to subordinates. \"Reagan liked things simplified,\" observes a former aide to fellow Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, \"not because he was a simple man, but because he didn't want to waste time getting information.\"\nThese examples of how past governors have ruled California - at times successfully and at times not - are a reminder that there is no one Jello-mold way to run an organism as vast and complex as a state with 35 million people and the world's sixth-largest economy. Never mind those unruly lawmakers in Sacramento. Still, certain traits and skills can put success within reach. Interviews with former governors, management experts, and analysts suggests that traits such as consensus building, the ability to focus on overarching goals, and vision - as gauzy a characteristic as that might be - are qualities that foster gubernatorial accomplishment.\nThey may be needed now more than ever. With polls showing a majority of Californians are ready to oust Gov. Gray Davis (D) in this fall's recall election, attention is focusing on the leadership skills and management acumen that will be needed to help bring the Golden State out if its financial funk and crisis of confidence.\nIndeed, the person who wins the Oct. 7 vote - Mr. Davis or one of the 135 other certified candidates whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s suggest a lot more \"can do\" than \"have done\" - will be piloting the state into a perfect storm of challenges: a gaping deficit, political gridlock in Sacramento, controversy over immigration, and soaring fees at a university system that has been the envy of the world.\n\"[Californians] have lost faith in the institutions of government,\" says Steve Merksamer, former chief of staff to Gov. George Deukmejian and a member of the Reagan administration in Sacramento. \"Whoever the next governor is will have to heal the state and ameliorate the divisions.\"\nThe experts have some suggestions on ways to do that.

It is the second victory in a week for mass mobilisations against dictatorial regimes in North Africa.\nBut the process of change is limited and needs to go much further. One of the groups that has led the protests has called on soldiers to stand with the people and not allow the generals to steal the revolution.\nThey have launched a social media hashtag \"He hasn't yet fallen\".\nSudan\u2019s minister of defence announced on Thursday that the army had removed Bashir and set up a transitional military council to rule the country for two years. He also announced a three-month state of emergency.\nSudan\u2019s cabinet and its parliament have been dissolved, and the country\u2019s constitution suspended.\nAll political prisoners detained by the security services since anti-government demonstrations began in December will be released.\nBashir had ruled since a military coup in 1989. The army moved to eject him because the protests were becoming a threat to much wider sections of the regime and the ruling class. In addition the US and Britain had signalled on Wednesday that they did not back him.\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last Saturday. And for six days there has been a mass occupation of an area in front of the army headquarters that also houses the president\u2019s official residence.\nThe military said Bashir was now being \u201ckept at a safe place\u201d. There are reports troops have arrested Sudan\u2019s prime minister Mohamed Taher Ayala and the head of the ruling National Congress Party, Ahmed Haroun.\nThe former defence minister and two vice-presidents have also been arrested. Troops stormed the Islamic Movement headquarters, part of the ruling party, on Thursday.\nThe protests broke out on 19 December as people rallied against the government tripling the price of a loaf of bread.\nThey rapidly spread across many of Sudan\u2019s major towns and cities, including areas that were supposedly strongholds of the regime. Protesters\u2019 slogans generalised from bread prices to opposition to years of economic hardship and the denial of democracy.\nWomen and young people have been prominent in the protests. The demonstrations have also united people from different groups in Sudanese society. For example, all protesters have taken up the demand for the rights of people in Darfur.\nOne of the main groups that has been spearheading the nationwide demonstrations is the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA). This is based mainly on doctors, teachers and journalists. It urged Khartoum residents to mass outside army headquarters on Thursday.\nLarge crowds remained on the streets of Khartoum throughout Thursday and Friday morning ignoring a curfew declared by the country's new military council.\nNobody should trust the army to bring the change that the protesters have fought for. The generals want to end the revolt and stop a real transformation that would benefit workers and the poor.\nThe key agency in forcing the removal of Bashir has been the mass mobilisations. There have also been some strikes.\nPeople will need to stay on the streets and stop the army strangling the movement. A general strike is the best response to the army's actions."}
{"idx": "8986", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Why on earth do we stay in a Church in which clerics commit sexual abuse? The easiest answer is realism. We tell ourselves that some sexual predators are drawn to seminaries, just as paedophiles seek out institutions that work with children, regardless of whether they\u2019re religious or not. Public schools, choirs, scouts: the cancer grows everywhere.\nAnd yet this argument just isn\u2019t good enough, because when a sexual crime occurs in the Church it is 10 times worse. The betrayal is even deeper. Every offence committed by a cleric is a stain not just on the Church\u2019s reputation, with which we can be inordinately obsessed, but the very soul of the institution. The Church asks its followers to confess their sins, but it seems far too slow to admit and atone for its own, and that hypocrisy has driven away thousands, possibly millions.\nSo, to repeat, why do so many of us remain? I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot in the wake of reports regarding Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, an American cleric accused of grooming and abusing young men. My instinct when reading this story was to say: \u201cThank God I\u2019m a convert.\u201d Some of my cradle friends joke that I\u2019m not a proper Catholic because I wasn\u2019t born into the faith, and they may have a point \u2013 I lack their foundation and sense of identity, and sometimes in church I find I simply don\u2019t know what to do. My Latin is rusty. The hymns are unfamiliar. I have nothing to say when the subject of Ireland comes up.\nOn the other hand, I have been spared from clericalism. I like and respect priests; some of my best friends are priests. But I didn\u2019t meet a Catholic cleric until I was in my 20s, and they don\u2019t quite have the aura of authority for me that I sense they have for those who were born into the Catholic family.\nLikewise, I am amazed, in my innocence, of the authority wielded by so many fallible, sometimes corrupt bishops. To me, there\u2019s no magic to them at all \u2013 they\u2019re just men in a big hat. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right or wrong about this, it\u2019s just that when I signed up to be a Catholic, I joined a faith, not a congregation.\nOf course, I quickly discovered that isn\u2019t sustainable. The faith and the institution are inseparable: you\u2019ll often hear ex-Catholics say they love one but not the other, and yet if you want the sacraments, you need the priest. If you want the priests, you need the bishops. If you want to fulfil the Church\u2019s commandments to love your fellow man, you absolutely need the congregation, too.\nAnd so, after years of telling myself that I don\u2019t want anything to do with the political or social life of the Church, I\u2019ve found myself inexorably drawn into both. It\u2019s actually impossible not to hold a view on Humanae Vitae or the Irish referendum; it\u2019s impossible not to care that Fr O\u2019Reilly has come down with a cold.\nAnd far from this picture being drawn in the media of clerics as complete disaster zones, I\u2019m happy to report how many of them turn out to be kind, intelligent, thoroughly human people bearing incredible witness in a society that either disregards them or hates them. And as for the few flawed clerics rotting in the barrel, we have to deal with them as honestly as possible. I might like to imagine that McCarrick and I"}

Traditional farmhouse examples, such as Montgomery\u2019s and Keen\u2019s, are still made from raw cows\u2019 milk and matured for up to 18 months, giving them a dry, flaky texture and a rich, tangy, often nutty character. Mass-produced examples tend to be aged for much shorter periods, and will have a creamier, moister texture and a milder flavour, but generally melt better when cooked.\nA mixture of vegetarian and animal rennets are used, depending on the producer. Cheddar is traditionally made from slabs of curd that are stacked on top of each other, and turned frequently. The pressure of their combined weight squeezes out any remaining whey; the slabs can then be cut into small pieces, salted, and put into moulds for maturing. This process is known as \u2018Cheddaring\u2019.\nCheddar comes in a wide variety of styles, from young and fresh to mature and crumbly. Cheeses labelled as West Country Cheddar must be made from cows reared in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset or Somerset using traditional methods.

An Operation Maintenance Servicer for Suzlon Energy, Alvarro thinks the lengthy 20-minute ladder climb to the top is well worth the effort.\nBut perched on a sliver of steel, twenty-six stories above the broad expanse of the Texas panhandle is a far cry from the eight-by-fourteen foot jail cell he found himself in four years ago. Alvarro\u2019s trip from prison to views rivaling some CEO\u2019s was made possible by a growing trend of economic empowerment programs creating \u201c green-collar jobs\u201d for low-income youth in the nation\u2019s emerging renewable energy economy.\nAfter being released from jail, Alvarro ran across a program called YouthBuild, where he learned advanced carpentry and practical job skills that helped land his current job. YouthBuild is one of several programs across the country striving for inclusion of people from low-income communities in our nation\u2019s developing green economy. One in eight Americans live in poverty and about 1.7 million poor youths were out of school and out of work in 2005, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress.\nLong before green-collar jobs became economic empowerment buzzwords, YouthBuild\u2019s founder, Dorthy Stoneman, realized the potential that equipping young people with practical job skills could have on both their employment potential and their communities. Over 25 years ago, Stoneman started YouthBuild, a youth empowerment program now serving over 200 areas around the world by teaching at-risk youth valuable trades while building housing for low-income communities. Training 7,000 at-risk individuals a year, YouthBuild helps youths earn their GEDs, start a business, and have a chance at a new life with eighty percent of participants continuing on to college or jobs, according to the agency.\nSince YouthBuild pioneered the concept of providing pathways out of poverty for low-income youth for over a generation, it\u2019s no surprise that the organization has joined the chorus of groups embracing the recent green-collar jobs movement. Eva Blake, YouthBuild\u2019s Green Initiative Director explained the organizational shift over the past few years in gearing its housing rehabilitation and construction programming toward the emerging green economy.\nAccording to the American Solar Energy Society, 2006 saw $970 billion in industry revenues and 8.5 million jobs in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. The Apollo Alliance, a joint venture of labor and environmental groups, illustrates that a considerable investment in renewable technology could lead to over 3 million new green jobs, fuel $1.4 trillion in new Gross Domestic Product and produce $284 billion in net energy savings.\nAlvarro thinks his green job maintaining and servicing windmills pays well and there\u2019s the potential to advance in the company. But his current success and the opportunities that lay in front of him are a long way from where he was just a few years ago.\nAfter several tough years, Alvarro finally landed in jail with a felony conviction. Describing jail as a \u201cpretty good wake-up call,\u201d Alvarro found himself at a turning point. He earned his GED while in jail, and when he got out, found YouthBuild.
