Mr. Roach is attempting to remove the strings from their customary role in a jazz context as a background cushion and, although they are not yet always placed on an equal footing with Mr. Roach's two-man horn section, the possibilities are already evident in the new repertory of arrangements written for the combined groups.\nMr. Roach's Quartet, built around his very positive, precisely punctuated drumming and the steady, throbbing tone of Tyrone Brown's bass, has a hard-edged attack that is extended in the long solos by the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the tenor-saxaphonist Odean Pope. There would be little place in such performances for softly humming violins even if Mr. Roach wanted them. Instead, they provide aggressive, slashing accents and colors that become part of the percussive setting led by Mr. Roach's drums.\nThe potential of the strings, and their range within Mr. Roach's overall concept, were most evident on the Joplin piece, adapted by Maxine Roach, Mr. Roach's daughter, who plays viola in the string group, and Mr. Weston's ''Hi-Fly.'' ''Easy Winners,'' a quartet arrangement for the strings alone, stayed very close to the mood of the Joplin piano rag, maintaining a deliberate, gracious tempo but with spirit and verve engendered by Diane Monroe's spunky first violin. ''Hi-Fly'' gave the strings equal standing with Mr. Roach's horns, offering them brief solo opportunities, a swinging series of exchanges between Miss Monroe and Miss Roach and an all-out bit of jamming that brought the horns in for a roof-raising finale.\nMr. Roach is opening doors with this double quartet."}

Fifty-five percent of U.S. adults say they are \"more enthusiastic\" about voting than usual, which contrasts with between 37% and 50% saying the same in Gallup's final pre-election surveys each midterm year from 1994 through 2014. Currently, 33% say they are \"less enthusiastic.\"\nThe latest results are based on Gallup polling conducted Sept. 17-23, as Congress has been holding hearings on President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.\nGallup's full midterm-election trend on voter enthusiasm -- including all measures taken prior to the final pre-election poll each year -- shows that voter enthusiasm was higher than today only once, in March 2010. At that time, shortly after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, 61% of U.S. adults said they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting. This proved temporary, however, as it fell to 49% in May 2010 and was 50% at the time of the election.\nMore generally, it appears that public enthusiasm about voting settles in to its final pattern by the fall of election years. In all midterm years when Gallup asked the enthusiasm measure multiple times (1994, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2014), the percentage feeling more enthusiastic than usual about voting either stayed the same or increased slightly between August or September and the final pre-election measure.\nToday's heightened enthusiasm is the result of high levels of enthusiasm among Republicans and Democrats -- possibly reflecting both party groups' enhanced recognition of the importance of the election in light of the high-stakes Kavanaugh hearings.\nSixty-one percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners and 58% of Republicans and Republican leaners say they are more enthusiastic about voting in November compared to prior elections. These levels roughly match Republicans' record-high enthusiasm in 2010, Barack Obama's first midterm, when the GOP won a whopping 63 seats. But this is the first time in Gallup's trend since 1994 that both parties have expressed high enthusiasm.\nBy contrast, the only two other times a majority of either party felt more enthusiastic than usual about voting, there was a partisan imbalance. In 2010, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to be enthusiastic -- 63% vs. 44% -- and in 2006, Democrats were more likely than Republicans, 53% to 44%.\nGallup also recorded sizeable partisan gaps in enthusiasm in 1994 and 2014, but enthusiasm was relatively low among both party groups, resulting in low overall enthusiasm.\nToday's heightened enthusiasm may not translate into higher turnout than in previous years, as a separate measure shows that Americans claim to be no more certain that they will vote in November than has been the case in previous elections.\nFifty-eight percent of U.S. adults describe themselves as absolutely certain they will vote. That is identical to Gallup's final measures in 2014 and 1998, but lower than in 1994, 2006 and 2010.\nToday's level of certainty is consistent with Gallup's early"}

Fertilizer was previously banned for just three winter months.\nCommissioners unanimously approved the ordinance, which also requires slow-release fertilizer to be used on lawns in the county from March to June. The measure takes effect Oct. 1, providing time for education efforts.\n\u201cThe springs are our red tide,\u201d said Commissioner Ken Cornell, referring to the way that groundwater pollution from fertilizer contributes to algae growth in springs.\nRed tide blooms along Florida\u2019s coasts and blue-green algae blooms in South Florida\u2019s waterways are getting far more attention from the Legislature this session than springs. State restoration plans for springs don\u2019t go far enough in stopping them from being polluted and their flow reduced, leading to a legal challenge from environmental groups.\nSure, the state has dedicated money to springs protection such as the $518,400 recently approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Cabinet to buy 160 acres in Columbia County. The land includes the route of an underground conduit providing water to Ichetucknee Springs.\nBut land purchases need to be combined with more aggressive efforts to limit excessive groundwater pumping as well as pollution from septic tanks, sewage systems and fertilizer from residential lawns and agriculture. Protecting groundwater helps keep springs as well as our drinking water source clean.\nState lawmakers have been haggling over stricter septic tank laws, trying to prevent a repeat of last summer\u2019s green slime outbreak in South Florida. The issue also deserves more action locally, including connecting Gainesville properties that are still on septic tanks to the municipal sewer system.\nFertilizer and animal waste also add nutrients to groundwater that fuel algae growth. With the state preempting local municipalities from regulating agriculture, the county is right to turn to reducing fertilizer applications on lawns.\nCertainly more must be done on the state level as well. The pollution and depletion of the Floridan Aquifer will likely get far worse unless the state adopts smarter policies about growth and the protection of natural resources.\nA growing population means greater water conservation is required to prevent environmental damage and ensure there is enough water for people to drink. Florida needs a wholesale effort to shift residential and commercial properties to landscapes that don\u2019t require wasteful watering and fertilizer.\nOther states have used \"cash for grass\" programs that provide financial assistance in converting lawns to drought-resistant plants. The University of Florida should promote the idea that residents should ditch their lawns rather than the interests of the turf-grass industry.\nOur state can't keep maintaining the myth that Floridians can have lush green lawns and still protect the environment. Alachua County\u2019s eight-month ban on applying fertilizer to lawns won\u2019t end the pollution of groundwater and springs, but it is a step in the right direction. The rest of Florida should follow suit."}

Cross-platform protection. All expected suite features perform well. Ransomware and spyware protection. System speedup and cleanup tools. Many useful bonus features.\nFeatures limited in iOS app. Mediocre score in one of our hands-on tests.\nIf what you want is every possible security component in one integrated package, Bitdefender Total Security is exactly what you need. It's an Editors' Choice for security mega-suite.\nSecurity companies that offer a basic security suite often add a higher-level suite, usually in one of two ways. Some create a mega-suite by adding advanced features for Windows computers, things like online backup and system performance optimization. Others go cross-platform, adding support for macOS, Android, and iOS. Bitdefender Total Security does a bit of both. On Windows, it adds system optimization and anti-theft. It also lets you install full-blown protection for your macOS and Android devices, and limited protection on iOS. Bitdefender Total Security is our current Editors' Choice for security mega-suite, and also does pretty well in the cross-platform realm.\nFor $89.99 per year you can install Bitdefender on five devices; upping that to $99.99 raises the limit to 10 devices. That same $99.99 would get you five licenses for Kaspersky Total Security, while Norton Security Premium costs $109.99 for 10 devices (plus 25GB of hosted online backup). Bitdefender's pricing sits in the middle. Note that for those who manage a ton of devices, McAfee Total Protection costs $99.99 per year for unlimited installations on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.\nAs befits a product that's not limited to one platform, you activate your subscription by entering a code in the Bitdefender Central online console. Once the product appears in your console, you can install it on the system you're using, or send an email with a link to install on other devices. The installation link automatically downloads the appropriate installer for the active operating system.\nOn a Windows device, the product looks almost identical to Bitdefender Internet Security. Other than the window title, the only difference is that the Utilities page gives you four useful utilities, instead of an invitation to upgrade.\nThe installer also adds Bitdefender's VPN, powered by AnchorFree Hotspot Shield Elite. However, to lift the 200MB daily bandwidth cap you must purchase a separate VPN subscription. For full details on the VPN and basic Windows suite, please read our review of Bitdefender Internet Security.\nOn the Utilities page of the Windows edition you'll find three optimization tools: OneClick Optimizer, Startup Optimizer, and Disk Cleanup. To get things rolling, click Optimize My Device under OneClick Optimizer. On my test system, the scan quickly found hundreds of items in the categories Disk Cleanup, Registry Cleanup, and Privacy Cleanup. As recommended, I clicked to view details in each category.\nDisk issues included junk, temporary, cache, and debug files, occupying 2GB of disk space.

{"idx": "11027", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Chimney fires are a serious problem.\nWood-burning fireplaces are warm, cozy and attractive, but they require proper maintenance, or the consequences could be quite severe. One of the major hazards of a wood-burning stove or fireplace is the development of creosote, a chemical that can build up on the inside of chimneys and flues. Regular cleaning and inspection, preferably by a professional, will prevent buildup, but you can prevent buildup yourself, as well, using chemicals that protect your fireplace from hazardous buildup and help you keep your home safe and clean.\nCreosote is a tarry substance that forms when wood burns and is carried up the inside of a chimney as part of the smoke. The creosote collects on the inside of the chimney and traps carbon, usually soot, which is also part of the smoke from burning wood. The mixture dries and bakes against the inside of the chimney. Not only does this cause ventilation problems, but the mixture is quite flammable, and a chimney fire is dangerous and can lead to the destruction of your chimney or even your home.\nSodium chloride, also known as table salt, is a simple chemical that is easy to find. Put a little salt in the fire while it is burning. The salt combines with the water in the burning wood to create a weak acid that travels up the chimney and dissolves small amounts of creosote. This method should be used with care, however. It should not be overdone and should not be used in a metal chimney, as the acid can interact with the metal and cause corrosion.\nWhen choosing a commercially made chimney cleaner, one of the most effective ingredients is copper sulfate. This material coats and interacts chemically with the soot embedded in the creosote inside of your chimney and helps it burn away at a lower temperature than is normally needed. However, like table salt, copper sulfate combines with water and creates sulfurous or sulfuric acid. This acid can damage the inside of your chimney, and so should be used with care.\nWhile chemical cleaners can prevent buildup of creosote, the only way to effectively remove creosote is to manually scrub the inside of the chimney with an appropriate brush. Chemical cleaners should never be your sole method of cleaning your chimney. In addition, overuse can damage chimneys, particularly metal-lined chimneys, and can reduce the life of your chimney or flue. Too much of a chimney-cleaning chemical can even cause a fire itself. An ounce per week is typically sufficient. Read all instructions before using any chemical cleaner.\nLeggett, Rochelle. \"Flue & Chimney Cleaning Chemicals.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/flue-chimney-cleaning-chemicals-47263.html.

In 2018, Democrats will be defending 26 seats, including two independents who caucus with them. Ten of those seats are in states President Trump won in 2016, and five are in states where he won by over 15 percentage points. Republicans, on the other hand, are only defending eight seats.\nRepublicans have seized on this dynamic, targeting Missouri and Indiana, state where President Donald Trump won handily last year and Sens. Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly are running for reelection, as two of the most optimal opportunities to turn the Senate seats red. On visits to tout his tax reform plan, President Trump specifically called out McCaskill and Donnelly, telling the crowds to vote them out of office if they don\u2019t support the plan. Neither of them have.\nIn order for Democrats to take control, they\u2019ll need to push back hard against these forces, keeping all of their seats in contention and flip an additional two.\nStill, Democrats argued it\u2019s within reach.\nChris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Majority Fund, a SuperPac aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told TIME that while the environment was undeniably tough for Republicans, the electoral map gives the party an advantage.\nThere is also the possibility that Republicans become even more energized following Jones\u2019 victory. Some of the most potentially competitive races, like Arizona and Nevada, include insurgent primary challengers \u2014 Kelli Ward in Arizona and Danny Tarkanian in Nevada \u2014 who are backed by Steve Bannon and embody the populist conservative grassroots movement, similar to Alabama\u2019s Republican candidate, Roy Moore. It is likely that Republicans will go into overdrive to ensure more centrist candidates prevail in the primaries.\nAlthough the Senate Leadership Fund has yet to detail its strategy, it has already released an ad blasting Ward and slammed Tarkanian on Twitter after he challenged Heller to sign a pledge replacing McConnell as Senate Majority Leader.\n\u201cWe will play in primaries because we think it\u2019s important to get candidates through their primaries who can win in November when it counts,\u201d said Pack."}

He has supported universal background checks for private gun sales and limits on magazine capacities for semi-automatic weapons, among other proposals.\nSauschuck took the outburst in stride, saying he recognized that different communities in Maine had different opinions on gun regulations. He said his views were formed by his personal background and experience in the military and law enforcement.\nSauschuck\u2019s work on the state\u2019s opioid overdose crisis garnered praise from a range of public health advocates including Jenna Menhert, the executive director of the National Alliance of Mental Illness Maine.\nMenhert said Sauschuck was among the first law enforcement leaders in Maine to embrace policies recognizing the differences between people suffering from mental illness or substance use disorder and criminal behavior.\nBut dozens of opponents spoke against Sauschuck for his positions on gun control.

They were led by opposition politicians from the left-wing Meretz Party and the largely-Arab Joint List coalition.\nThe protestors accuse the government of stepping up demolitions of Arab homes built without permits to appease conservative Israelis angry about the demolition of the controversial Amona settlement on the West Bank.\n\"The law must be equitable. The same law which obliges vacating Amona also obliges removing illegal construction in other parts of our country,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video address in December, as quoted by AFP.\n\"Therefore, I have given orders to speed up demolition of illegal construction... in all parts of the country and we shall do that in the coming days.\"\nThe Amona outpost was cleared out Thursday in spite of violent resistance from protesters, and the buildings on the site are due to be demolished shortly. However, while Amona was deemed illegal even by Israeli courts, the government routinely approves the construction of settlements on occupied territories in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. By contrast, the authorities relatively rarely grant permits for the building of Arab homes.\nUmm al-Hiran, the unrecognized Bedouin village in southern Israel which is due to be demolished, was the site of an alleged terrorist attack in January in which two people lost their lives. The police claim a local man, Yakub Abu al-Kiyan, ran over and killed an Israeli policeman, Sgt. Maj. Erez Levi, before being shot dead himself, and that the 50-year-old had pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). Villagers deny the allegations and say he was a respectable teacher. An initial autopsy showed al-Kiyan may have lost control of his vehicle after getting shot in the knee, causing him to slam into Levi, but further investigations have proved inconclusive.\nAmal Abu Sa'ad, the widow of Yakub Abu al-Kiyan, addressed the crowd on Saturday.\nArabs make up around one-fifth of Israel\u2019s population and routinely complain about discrimination and being denied the same settlement rights as Jews.\nThe Israeli settlements in the West Bank and other occupied areas are among the most contentious issues in Arab-Israeli relations. Despite the UN and international community considering them illegal under existing agreements, Israel continues to expand its settlements in the territory, something which both the Palestinians and outside powers, including the United States, see as an obstacle to the peace process."}

Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner, who authored the bill, said it would put a \"definitive end\" to the exchange of fetal tissue in Texas.\n\"People of conscience can't stand by while unborn babies are monetized and traded like some sort of perverse commodity,\" Schwertner said in a written statement. \"The state has a moral obligation to protect our most vulnerable Texans \u2014 a group that certainly includes the unborn.\"\nThe legislation, Senate Bill 8, would prohibit physicians from knowingly performing this type of late-term abortion and subject those who did to criminal charges. The bill defines \"partial-birth\" abortions as when part of the fetus is outside the body of the mother and \"the partially delivered living fetus\" is aborted. The practice was made illegal in the U.S. more than a decade ago.\nHeather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said she thinks the legislation is purely political.\n\"It seems absurd that this is something that the Legislature might waste their time on when it already exists in federal law,\" Busby said. \"Once again, this is a solution in search of a problem.\"\nSenate Bill 8 would also ban the donation of fetal tissue to unauthorized institutions. Authorized institutions would only be able to donate fetal tissue to accredited universities for approved research. The sale of fetal tissue is currently illegal, but the donation of fetal tissue is not.\nTexas Republicans have pushed for a bill banning fetal tissue donations since undercover videos from an anti-abortion group in California purported to show Planned Parenthood officials selling aborted fetal tissue. The videos have been discredited, and Planned Parenthood says it does not take fetal tissue donations in Texas.\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick cited the undercover videos as a reason for the legislation.\n\"In the wake of discovering the notorious Planned Parenthood videos last year, in which employees were caught callously discussing the procurement of aborted baby body parts, the Texas Senate is taking aggressive steps to criminalize these despicable acts,\" he said in a written statement.\nThe bill also notes that a person can't donate a placenta or an umbilical cord. Only authorized facilities can, according to the bill, and the donated placentas or umbilical cords can't be from \"elective abortions.\"\nThe bill was co-authored by Sens. Donna Campbell, Lois Kolkhorst, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Charles Perry."}

People drink it year round,\" says Nash.\nOne reason for the beer's appeal might be that it doesn't smack you over the head with the fruit, isn't cloyingly sweet, and it tastes like natural fruit, not artificial gunk \u2013 all common flaws in many fruit beers. The blueberry presence comes from a natural extract Nash uses.\nAs a homebrewer, Nash had made blueberry beer with the fruit itself, but there was a slight problem.\n\"When blueberries go through fermentation they don't taste like blueberries any more,\" Nash explained.\nThe golden, slightly-cloudy brew has a pleasant aroma of fresh blueberries. The fruit also comes through in the flavour, along with a bit of bitterness from the Willamette hops used in the brew. Willamette is an American hybrid of the traditional English variety Fuggles, and lends an earthy character to some beers. That earthiness isn't particularly evident in this beer, but then again, this brew's about the fruit, not the hops.\n\"I'd call it a golden ale, rather than a pale ale. It's not particularly hoppy,\" says Nash, a well-known hophead whose passion for bitter beers is best shown in Pumphouse's SOB (Special Old Bitter, of course \u2013 what else did you think, you naughty person), which isn't yet available in Ontario.\nWith the fruit beer well established, Nash has also been tinkering with other plants as part of Pumphouse's brewpub, which functions essentially as an R & D arm for the brewery. One of his latest brews at the pub is a German style wheat beer flavoured with lemongrass and ginger.\n\"We like to give things a twist,\" says Nash, who hopes the Thai Wheat will eventually be bottled as well."}

{"idx": "11056", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The exit of Steve Bannon, the President\u2019s political strategist, from the White House and his return to Breitbart.com marks the defeat, if not quite the end, of the \u201cisolationist\u201d America First faction within the Trump administration. It is a victory for what I call the Junta \u2013 the coterie of generals who now surround President Trump, and appear to have captured the conduct of American foreign policy. It is a victory, in particular, for Gen. H. R. McMaster, who took over the National Security Agency after Michael Flynn\u2019s ouster, and who is the architect of the \u201cnew\u201d Afghanistan strategy \u2013 the one that is merely a reiteration of the old strategy.\nBannon has been a particular target of the liberal media, which is responsible for labeling him as an advocate of the so-called \u201calt-right.\u201d Yet there is exactly zero evidence of this allegiance in his public pronouncements, and his most recent interview \u2013 with the liberal journal, The America Prospect \u2013 has him characterizing them as a sad \u201ccollection of clowns.\u201d Not that this will deter Bannon\u2019s critics, who uniformly fail to mention what really set him apart from your run-of-the-mill Republican operative, and that is his foreign policy views.\n\u201cFrom Afghanistan and North Korea to Syria and Venezuela, Mr. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, has argued against making military threats or deploying American troops into foreign conflicts.\nIt\u2019s delightful to hear that Bannon describes General McMaster is the leader of the \u201cglobalist empire project\u201d \u2013 a project, one might add, that many of us hoped might be dismantled during a Trump presidency.\nYet it was not to be: instead, the McMaster faction\u2019s success in displacing Bannon, marks the virtual end of the \u201cisolationists\u201d as a coherent force in the White House. While it\u2019s true that both Stephen Miller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are both skeptics of foreign adventurism, the former is primarily a speechwriter and the latter is a) on the outs with Trump and b) peripheral when it comes to foreign affairs.\nWhat we are seeing with Bannon\u2019s return to the world of publishing is the separation of Trump from his base, the definitive if not quite final splitting away of Trumpism from Trump. In this sense, Bannon may be more effective on the outside looking in, as a lobby for the original Trumpism \u2013 the version that called out the Bush administration for lying us into the Iraq war and that abjured regime change.\nAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, the political significance of Trump\u2019s rise was the defeat of neoconservative foreign policy orthodoxy and the advent of what the political class disdains as \u201cisolationism.\u201d Now it looks as though the neocons have reversed that victory inside the corridors of power: yet the hearts and minds of the 36 million voters who cast their ballots for Trump are still up for grabs. Meanwhile the cadre of a new conservatism, one that rejects internationalism and perpetual war, are coalescing around the banner of Bannonism.\nWhile Bannon is going out vowing to defend the President against his critics, the direction that the administration is taking almost ensures that Trump\u2019s former chief ideologue will join the ranks of those critics. In the end, the greatest enemy of Trumpism may not be the gaggle of losers, whiners, and special interests that make up the so-called \u201cResistance,\u201d but rather Trump himself."}

Figure out what you need and gather your materials.\nIf you log in to an account that's not yours, you could be in violation of something more serious than a website's terms of service.

Each is associated with different risks and benefits with no consensus as to the most effective form of treatment, though life expectancy, other illnesses, cancer severity and patient preferences may account in part for treatment choices. Parsons and colleagues at UCLA compared the types of treatments prostate cancer patients received from public and private hospitals as part of a California public assistance program. The researchers analyzed the care provided to 559 men enrolled in a state-funded program for low-income patients known as Improving Access, Counseling and Treatment for Californians with Prostate Cancer (IMPACT).\nBetween 2001 and 2006, 56 percent of the study participants received treatment from county hospitals and 44 percent received care from private facilities. While tumor characteristics were similar in each group, patients treated in private facilities were more likely than those treated in county hospitals to be white and less likely to undergo surgery. Specifically, patients treated in private facilities were nearly two-and-a-half times more likely than those treated in county hospitals to receive radiation and more than four-and-a-half times more likely to initially receive hormone therapy instead of surgery.\nWhile the reasons for these differences in treatment decisions are not known, the type of doctor that patients see may play a role, according to Parsons. At county hospitals, patients were initially under the care of urologists, while the initial providers at private facilities represented urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.\n\u201cThe fact that prostate cancer patients are treated differently based on the type of hospital has implications for health policy, quality of care and equality of care\u2014particularly because public hospitals are funded by city and state governments to provide health care for underserved, poor populations,\u201d said Parsons.\nAfter skin malignancies, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men.\nAdditional authors include Lorna Kwan (UCLA), Sarah E.

He said he was visiting friends and doing some Christmas shopping. But he never returned.\nBerg was arrested by agents from Russia\u2019s FSB security service, the successor agency to the KGB, who said they found an envelope on him holding 3,000 euros in cash. They accused him of involvement in an elaborate spying operation, dating back to 2015, to obtain information about Russia\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet in the far north.\nTen months later, Berg remains detained in Moscow\u2019s high-security Lefortovo prison, still not officially charged but facing the possibility of 20 years behind bars. Relations between Russia and Norway\u2014a NATO member\u2014have plunged to their lowest point since the Cold War. But many suspect there\u2019s another level to this Arctic spy drama and that Russia may have been just as interested in sowing distrust and divisions within its Nordic neighbor\u2014prompted partly by a recent increase in U.S. troops in Norway and a planned NATO exercise\u2014as shutting down any spying on its undersea activities.\nConsidering the national fallout from Berg\u2019s arrest, Russia may be succeeding at just that. The case is making clear that the blurred battle lines of the information war between Russia and the West have now spread to the Arctic Circle\u2014and even to a friendly place where the emphasis has long been on Norwegians and Russians working together.\nMoreover, there are new signs that the Cold War-style conflict is escalating: Recently, Britain announced that it was sending 800 marine commandos to Norway (its equivalent of the U.S. Marines) and setting up a small Arctic base there as part of a wider strategy aimed at curbing Russian military maneuvers in the far north. The Russian Embassy in London called the plans \u201cunjustified\u201d and said they would contribute to unnecessary tensions between the two countries.\nIn the center of Kirkenes hangs a large banner with Berg\u2019s face and the words \u201cHelp Frode home!\u201d in Norwegian. It serves as a daily reminder of the cross-border tensions. But travel around the town and signs of cooperation are everywhere\u2014literally, with place names in both Norwegian and Russian. Many local residents speak Russian as well as Norwegian.\nIn the harbor, fishing boats with Russian and Norwegian flags unload the day\u2019s catch. Every day, buses bring Russian shoppers across the border to stock up on Western goods, thanks to a visa-free travel deal for local residents. Norwegians go the other way to fill up on cheap gasoline.\nIt\u2019s the product of years of effort by both sides, since the end of the Cold War, to forge deeper relations at this local level, independent of geopolitics. And it has been a useful boost to the economy in Kirkenes and the surrounding Finnmark county region. Berg\u2014a retired border guard\u2014had long been active in building these ties, volunteering in rural Russia and organizing a series of cross-border festivals.\nSo his arrest left many in Kirkenes wondering how a pensioner who had devoted his retirement to building closer ties with Russia could have become entangled in a cross-border espionage plot.\nThis spring, Berg himself added a new layer of intrigue when he admitted, through his lawyer, that he had actually been working with Norwegian military intelligence.

The DC Extended Universe film has quickly become a success, earning strong reviews and more than doubling its budget at the global box office so far. Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. has already gotten the ball rolling on the sequel, which will build on the first movie's mid-credits introduction to the villainous caterpillar, Mister Mind. Shazam! writer Henry Gayden is currently working on the followup, with Sandberg expected to officially sign on as director any day now.\nIn the meantime, Sandberg is keeping busy entertaining fans with more Shazam!-related trivia. It had already been revealed that the director appears in the movie as one of the Crocodile Men, who are shown playing cards behind one of the doors that Billy Batson and his foster siblings open in the Rock of Eternity (while they're being chased by Sivana and the Seven Sins). Now, Sandberg has provided a glimpse at the process that he went through to become one of those reptilian men.\nSandberg posted a series of images to his Instagram account, showing him being fitted for a mold for his Crocodile Man mask. The post also includes a pair of clips where the filmmaker tries out the mask's animatronics, along with a short video that offers an up-close look at one of the mask's motorized eyes. You can check the whole thing out in the space below.\nFunnily enough, Sandberg's cameo could payoff in a big way in Shazam! 2 or another future DCEU film. In the New 52 comics (which Shazam! draws from), the Crocodile Men hale from a region of the Seven Magical Realms known as the Wildlands, where animals walk around talking and wearing clothing just like humans from our world. Of course, there's no guarantee that magical land will show up in the Shazam! sequel, given how expensive it would be to bring to life on the big screen. Part of the reason the first movie's a success is because Sandberg was able to keep its budget down to a manageable $100 million, so WB might prefer to continue that approach with the followup. If so, it's unlikely Billy and his family will be exploring The Magiclands anytime soon in the DCEU.\nEither way, this is a fun glimpse behind the scenes at Sandberg's cameo and one of many playful DC easter eggs in Shazam!. It's also a testament to just much Sandberg clearly enjoyed making the movie, and all but assures that he'll be back for more on Shazam! 2. Whether he shows up dressed as an anthropomorphic reptile again or tries his hand at playing another fantastical creature in the sequel, of course, remains to be seen."}

But those still reliant on food stamps continue to struggle, since the stipends aren\u2019t intended to cover an entire grocery bill.\nAccording to Hunger Free Colorado, an organization that networks food pantries across the state and advocates against policies that create barriers to access, food stamps provided to eligible families average only about $1.40 per person per meal \u2014 hardly enough for a healthy meal.

However, this surge of malware attracted the attention of ESET because it was quite similar to the Storm attacks the company had witnessed in 2007, as reported by The Tech Herald on December 22, 2008.\nFurther, while describing the way the newly found malware works, Pierre-Marc Bureau said that once a user clicks on the link, a backdoor is downloaded that links to another website and records information online from the user's computer.\nBureau further says that the attack employs fast-flux so that the web servers of the attack can not be traced. It also makes difficult for security experts to trace the redirection page which is quite similar to those that Storm used in 2007. Yet, the attack isn't the revival of the Storm botnet, notes Bureau.\nMeanwhile, ESET has described the new virus as a new version of Win32/Waledac malware after studying the malevolent links as well as the downloaded files that first appeared on the Web during March 2008.\nThe security researchers at ESET reveal that the new malware bears no P2P abilities and utilizes an Open Source packer in place of the tailored packer that Storm had used. Furthermore, the EXE files that ESET examined bear cryptographic abilities that the Storm worm did not have."}

In the years before independence, he played a leading role at many of the peace talks and negotiations held to end the war in the then Rhodesia, while Robert Mugabe remained in exile in the Mozambique bush.\nBut his hopes of power were to be dashed. In 1978 Sithole agreed to participate in the transitional four-man executive council. This was a prelude to the first black majority government, headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the leader of the United African Council. Muzorewa's government was seen by many black Africans as a puppet of the white minority regime.\nSithole's dealings with Smith compromised him in the eyes of many of his supporters, and though he took part in the Lancaster House talks which led to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, in the elections that followed his rival Robert Mugabe swept to power and Sithole's Zanu (Ndonga) faction failed to win a single seat.\nNdabaningi Sithole was born on July 1 1920, the son of an illiterate carpenter. He paid his way through his primary education at the Dadya Mission School by working as a chef's assistant. The school's headmaster was Garfield Todd, later Rhodesia's Prime Minister. In 1939 Sithole won a scholarship to Waddilove Training Institute, where he took a teaching diploma in 1941. For the next 14 years he worked as a teacher.\nA deeply religious man, in 1955 he enrolled at Newton Theological College, Massachusetts, and on his return to Rhodesia was ordained a minister of the Congregationalist Church at Mount Selinda. Sithole's political career began when he was elected in 1959 to head the African Teachers' Association. The same year he published African Nationalism, in which he called for equality between the races. In a foreword to the book, Garfield Todd described Sithole as \"a young African who has struggled against odds which would have dismayed most men\".\nSithole resigned as president of the African Teachers' Association in 1960 to devote himself full time to politics as treasurer of the National Democratic Party. When the party was banned the following year, he joined Joshua Nkomo in the new Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu). In 1963, however, he split from Nkomo and formed Zanu, becoming its first president, with Mugabe as his second-in-command. Together they called for armed struggle against white oppression.\nThe next year Sithole was jailed for 12 months for circulating a \"subversive\" letter. Although he won on appeal, he was kept in prison until 1965, when he was sent into political detention for a further three years at the Wha Wha restriction camp.\nHe was allowed out on two occasions: in 1965 for talks with the visiting British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson; and again three years later for talks with the Commonwealth Secretary, George"}

{"idx": "11103", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Many Donald Trump supporters have generously taken time in recent days to explain what the president-elect would have to do to lose their support. So far, I\u2019ve highlighted two emails that represent significant if opposing factions within the Trump coalition: an immigration restrictionist hoping for conservative Supreme Court appointments and a moderate who wants Trump to govern as a liberal-centrist. It will be tough, I think, for the president-elect to satisfy both of those factions.\nToday I present an email from a different kind of Trump supporter. He represents a much smaller part of the Trump coalition. And yet, it is a part that depresses me, because my 20-something correspondent has given up on the American experiment. Lest you think I exaggerate, I\u2019ll let him present his ideas in his own words.\nI'm a college-educated white male in my late 20s. Before I became a devotee of Trumpism, I voted for Ron Paul in both 2008 and 2012. I used to define myself as a Libertarian, but have intellectually drifted away from it. These days, I'm probably better defined as a Neo-Reactionary with a fondness for the writings of Nick Land and the political economy of Lee Kuan Yew. To answer the question as to why I would support Trump and how he could break my support, I think it\u2019s important to step back and consider the broader context of Trump\u2019s rise.\nIn the late 1970s, the assumption was that the Soviet Union\u2019s system was effectively a permanent fixture in world affairs. Few would have imagined that within 10 years, the system that had looked so stable would collapse. The ideological boundaries it set for itself rendered it unable to address the crisis that afflicted its economy. We might have imagined 10 years ago that Liberal Democracy was similarly stable, but today, that looks increasingly less certain.\nThis should be no surprise. Every social idea, every system, is born for a particular set of conditions, and dies when the conditions that permitted its existence no longer hold. Liberal Democracy's underpinning was very simple: no other system could deliver constant gains to living standards, widely distributed prosperity, and government which was institutionally capable. The alternatives had either been systematically destroyed and buried by history or collapsed upon themselves.\nThe conditions which legitimized Liberal Democracy have now ended. Liberal Democracy, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has produced a crisis of underemployment, stagnant growth, systemic incompetence, and total declining living standards for all but a tiny minority of people who have reaped essentially all meaningful benefits from globalization.\nAs I see it, the most important underpinning of liberal democracy is that no system better safeguards life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, not that it promises \u201cconstant gains to living standards\u201d (though in the long run it excels at generating wealth, too). No system can promise constant gains in living standards. In America, the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d survived a sharp drop in living standards during the Great Depression that makes our recent banking and financial crisis pale in comparison, and then lived through one of the greatest expansions of wealth in world history. Constant gains is an untenable standard.\nThough I agree with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders that today\u2019s elites have rigged the system in various ways, and support many reform proposals on the right and left (though none of them original to the president-elect, who I expect to exacerbate the problem), it is an irrational moment to give up on liberal democracy.

The measure would appear on the fall ballot, but both camps are already amassing war chests and firing opening shots in what would certainly be a bruising and costly fight.\n\"Visions of dollars signs are dancing in the heads of political consultants up and down the state,\" said Bruce Cain, professor of political science at Stanford University. \"This is a big-time bonanza for them.\"\nIf the measure makes the ballot, it will unleash a torrent of negative advertising about greedy lawyers and negligent doctors.\nThe initiative's backers have until March 24 to submit signed petitions to place their proposal on the ballot.\nCalifornia's Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act was crafted in 1975, when Gov. Jerry Brown convened a special legislative session to address skyrocketing liability insurance costs that fueled concerns doctors would flee the state.\nUnder the law, patients who sue for malpractice can recover no more than $250,000 for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering. The law also limits attorneys' fees based on damages. There is no cap on economic damages, such as compensation for medical bills or lost wages.\nPhysicians and insurance companies say the limits have kept liability insurance rates in check. Changing the law, they assert, could increase those rates enough to put community clinics out of business.\nAnd many healthcare providers, already worried about the federal Affordable Care Act's effect on their bottom lines, fear a surge in healthcare costs as doctors rely on more tests and procedures to guard against lawsuits.\nTrial attorneys argue that medical malpractice premiums are a tiny fraction of healthcare spending. They say the damage limits, which have not been adjusted for inflation, make it economically impossible for them to take on many malpractice cases.\nThe lawyers have unsuccessfully challenged the limits in the courts and the Legislature.\nThe law's defenders, in the meantime, have expanded their coalition of insurance companies and physicians to include other medical providers such as Planned Parenthood and community clinics, as well as some labor groups. A dedicated advocacy organization, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, focuses on fending off those who want the law changed.\nBrian Kabateck, past president of Consumer Attorneys of California, said his industry's political clout in the Capitol was at stake in the push to revamp the law.\n\"At some point, our members feel, you just have to turn and fight,\" Kabateck said.\nThe proposed measure would adjust the pain-and-suffering cap to account for inflation since 1975. That would raise it to about $1.1 million, various analyses show. The cap would also be indexed to future inflation rates.\nThis year, there's a new spin on the old conflict: The proposal also would require hospitals to randomly test doctors for drug use and require physicians to check a statewide prescription drug database before prescribing certain"}

She is the leader of the Senate Democratic chiefs of staff\u2014a position she earned after a group of women chiefs rallied together to put a fellow woman forward.

She and her siblings often supported different Democratic primary candidates, \"making for interesting dinner conversation.\"\nBy the time Keefe was entering the workforce, fighting for a seat at the table in Washington was not always as easy.\nKeefe first came to Washington in the early 1990s to be a writer for Campaign Magazine. Three years later, after working on an abortion-rights referendum campaign in Maryland, she left for a press position in the office of Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, eventually becoming the Democratic congresswoman's chief of staff. It was then, Keefe recalls, that she got her first glimpse of how being a female leader in Washington sometimes has a particular and unpredictable set of challenges.\nShe realized it during a House leadership retreat at Wintergreen Resort in Virginia.\n\"Every one of the male staffers is out playing golf with members of Congress, and I am in the hotel stuffing packets for the meetings,\" she remembers. \"That's when I was like, 'I am never doing this again. I am learning how to play golf.'\"\nOn the wall of her office, Keefe now proudly exhibits two plaques documenting her holes-in-one. The story is one Keefe has recounted many times as an illustration of just how slight the imbalance between men and women on Capitol Hill can be.\n\"The signs of discrimination are more subtle these days in all professions,\" Keefe says.\nLater, Keefe left the Hill to work as a political consultant.

He was raised in Panama and says he believes in giving back not only here, but in Panama as well.\nThe area of western Panama visited by Pella has a very high HIV/AIDS rate and is impoverished, making it very difficult to treat the many patients infected with the disease there, Pella noted. Drug costs are very high, and education regarding prevention, treatment, and living safely with the disease are basically nonexistent.\nThrough the medical nonprofit organization HOPE Across the Globe, Inc., a Jacksonville-based 501(c)3 organization, (which he and fellow Infectious Disease specialist Dr. Ivan Guerrero created with the assistance of John Wilburth), the trip was made possible. They created the charity organization to help not only local residents living with HIV/AIDS, but to help sponsor trips to Panama and Peru as well, where HIV/AIDS is rampant. Medications for the trip were secured by numerous sources, and taken to Panama to give to the hospital serving that region, Hospital Regional del Oriente Chiricano.\nEducational materials printed in Spanish were also collected and delivered.\nPella provided HIV/AIDS updates to the medical staff there as well, including Dr. Orlando Quintero and Dr. Nestor Sosa. Quintero is the medical director of Probidsida, the testing and referral center for HIV/AIDS in Panama. Sosa, is the director of Laboratorios Gorgas, the main research institute for HIV/AIDS in Panama. While in Panama, Pella also visited the HIV clinic at the Indian nation of the Gnabe-Bugle in the province of Chiriqui, Panama.\nAccording to Eric Goosby, Ambassador, U.S. Global AIDS coordinator, \"at this point in history, there is no reason why children should be born with HIV. Yet 390,000 infants around the globe were born with the virus in 2010.\" Providing pregnant women with antiretroviral drugs can prevent the virus from being transmitted to their children. This also helps keep the mothers alive, preventing thousands of children from becoming orphans.\nThese essential medications are expensive, and to make this intervention work, the drugs must be more readily available to all HIV pregnant women world wide, not just in affluent countries, Goosby noted. Stopping mother-to-child (maternal/fetal) transmission is the key to working toward the goal of an AIDS-free generation. Countries like Panama and Peru lack the resources to adequately deal with this epidemic, and just as in the United States, the main problem is getting these antiretroviral drugs to those most in need.\nGoosby goes on to state that \"preventing new HIV infections among children is not only the right thing to do, but also a smart investment-stretching each dollar we invest to save as many lives as we can, both today and tomorrow.\" By saving mothers' lives, and having babies born HIV free, future healthcare costs would be diminished. This would also help keep families and communities intact, impacting economies and nations in a positive way, Goosby concluded."}

Most notable, there was the declaration by the Arab nations meeting in Beirut of their willingness to recognize Israel, after fifty years of denial of its right to exist.\nPredictably brushing aside the Arab vision, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon revved up his tanks for a military solution, declaring a \u201cstate of war\u201d with the Palestinians and invading the West Bank. Their nation, he told Israelis, is \u201cat a crossroads.\u201d So it is. The road down which Sharon is taking them, with a green light from the Bush Administration, leads to more deaths, more brutalizing of civilians, more violations of human rights\u2013and answering violence and anger by the Palestinians, with more suicide bombers making barbarous war on Israeli civilians.\nThe other road, the road to peace, leads toward the goal, articulated anew in Beirut, of a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, making way for a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, in return for normalization of relations with the Arab states.\nAt Beirut, in another step for regional peace, the Arab nations brokered Iraq\u2019s recognition of Kuwait\u2019s sovereignty, called for an end to UN sanctions, for dialogue between Baghdad and the UN and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the region. Most significant, they expressed united opposition to US military action against Iraq. This move undercut the Bush Administration\u2019s political rationale for attacking Iraq and in effect denied it the regional bases and logistical support essential to success in such a war.\nFaced with those impediments, the Administration put its Iraq plans on hold and turned to the crisis in the Middle East. But Bush seems more concerned with maintaining the domestic political momentum of his war on terror (just as Sharon is driven by the harder-line challenge on his right from Benjamin Netanyahu) than he is with making the tough political choices that would lead to a just settlement.\nBush still could choose the road to peace, whether or not Sharon takes that same road. He could reaffirm the US commitment to the March 12 UN resolution calling for a two-state solution, adopt the Arab peace scheme as a vision that could give Palestinians hope of an independent state, re-endorse the recent Security Council resolution calling for Sharon\u2019s withdrawal from Palestinian cities and dispatch the Secretary of State to the region with a plan that guarantees Israel\u2019s security, calls for abandonment of Israeli settlements and the withdrawal of Israel to 1967 borders\u2013a plan backed up by firm promises of monitors and the material and financial resources necessary to make it work.\nDoes Bush have the courage to take that road\u2013to risk the prestige of his Administration and the resources of the United States in the cause of achieving a just peace? The State Department mildly criticized Sharon\u2019s incursion, but Bush seems to be giving Sharon free rein. The only hope is for the thus-far-small opposition in this country to build pressure on him and make clear that Sharon\u2019s way condemns both Israelis and Palestinians to more suffering and bloodshed. We in America must add our voices to the burgeoning protests in the Middle East, Europe and Asia and to the eloquent warnings voiced by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Pope John Paul II and other world leaders. Only a US-led third-party intervention can forge a settlement that will end the violence."}

The police department\u2019s actions in the case of undocumented immigrants discovered the previous December sparked a lawsuit against the city by the state Attorney General. The city attorney says the lawsuit \u2014 and an op-ed written by AG Ken Paxton \u2014 are in error.\nTexans hold a broad range of views on our nation\u2019s immigration laws. They express those views when they go to the ballot box to vote for their U.S. senators and representatives, not when they elect state and local officials.\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to create a comprehensive immigration policy. Texas has no such far-reaching power, but it can act \u2014 and has \u2014 to ensure that law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities to get criminal illegal aliens off Texas streets. This requirement is vital for upholding both the rule of law and public safety.\nUnfortunately, many politicians today \u2014 in Texas and elsewhere \u2014 seem to think they are only bound to uphold laws they agree with. As attorney general, it is my duty to defend the rule of law and ensure that dangerous approach is not allowed to stand.\nIn 2017, the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 4. That bill is a commonsense law to protect the safety of Texans by barring local law enforcement from \u201cprohibiting or materially limiting\u201d the enforcement of immigration law.\nThe Legislature passed it against the backdrop of concern about crimes committed by illegal aliens, as well as local officials bent on refusing to cooperate with federal authorities. Between June 1, 2011, and Nov. 30 of this year, illegal aliens were charged with 288,000 criminal offenses; these include 538 homicide charges, 32,005 assault charges and 36,346 drug charges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld virtually every element of SB4.\nOn Friday, my office sued the city of San Antonio, its police chief and Police Department, and its city manager. The lawsuit follows months of investigation initiated by a formal complaint.\nOur investigation revealed that in December, a dozen likely illegal aliens were found in the back of a tractor-trailer in San Antonio in what appeared to be a human-smuggling operation.\nBy contrast, McManus instructed the immigration officer from Homeland Security to cover his badge and restricted his participation in the investigation. And when immigration authorities repeatedly asked to take the aliens into custody, McManus instead delivered them to a private entity that released them onto the streets of San Antonio.\nThere were several important acts our investigation could not find. We could not find any legal action San Antonio has taken against the driver of the tractor, despite his having confessed to human smuggling while in custody.\nWe could not find evidence of a referral to the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate the safety of the minor who was in the trailer.\nAnd we could not find verified identities or criminal histories of the released aliens. We know only that they were either participants in a human-smuggling operation or the victims of one, crossed the U.S. border illegally and were nevertheless released onto our streets.\nMedia reports have characterized the police chief\u2019s behavior as \u201cunusual.\u201d But the point of my lawsuit isn\u2019t to determine if what occurred that day was unusual. It\u2019s to determine if the Police Department and chief materially limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\nThat is what Senate Bill 4"}

Kirby is the author of \"Last Descendants: An Assassin's Creed Novel Series, Book 1.\"\nThe world of Assassin\u2019s Creed has spread throughout media since its release almost a decade ago, spanning a prolific series of video games, novels and even a movie slated for release later this year. In Assassin\u2019s Creed games and books, advanced technology unlocks ancient memories housed in DNA. A person, using an immersive piece of virtual reality equipment called an Animus, can then relive his ancestors\u2019 lives: walking in their footsteps, speaking their words and, sometimes, carrying out their assassinations.\n\"Last Descendants,\" written by Utah author Matthew J. Kirby, warmly embraces this proven Assassin\u2019s Creed formula, pitting a group of teenagers against the sheer chaos of the draft riots of 1863 New York City. As they scour their ancestors' lives for the lost hiding place of a powerful ancient artifact, they cross each other's paths as some bolster the riots and others struggle to stop it or just survive. Through these 150-year-old memories, the characters must deal with their ancestors' emotions for each other crossing over into the present day, such as two friends becoming sworn enemies during the Civil War or two modern teenagers untangling their romantic relationship.\nFor a young adult novel based on a video game series about stabbing people, Kirby\u2019s new novel and its characters are complex and vivid. Between the teenagers and their ancestors, it\u2019s the characters from the 19th century that steal the show as the modern-day scenes lack the spark that the historical scenes kindle.\nKirby doesn\u2019t shy away from including lots of violence, as would be expected from a novel written in the Assassin\u2019s Creed universe, where beatings, swordplay and poisonings are commonplace. \"Last Descendants\" includes all of these violent elements in abundance in almost every chapter, and some descriptions are graphic.\nThe book tones down the profanity found in the Mature-rated video games but is still peppered with minor language, and there\u2019s one instance of extremely strong swearing mixed with strong racial slurs. Also toned down, but still present, are sexual innuendos, some subtle and others rather direct, in addition to unspoken and implied threats of sexual violence.\nThere are a few plot holes and a contrivance here and there, but the narrative is complex enough to serve as a driver for an exceptional character story. Even though the modern-era conclusion is less an ending and more a buildup to the sequel, \"Last Descendants\" is an immersive read, engrossing from beginning to end.\n\"Last Descendants\" is scheduled to be released Tuesday, Aug. 30.\nWhen: Tuesday, Aug. 30, 7 p.m.\nNote: The signing line is for those who buy a copy of the featured book from The King's English."}

{"idx": "11158", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Which, if you pause to consider the actual narrative rather than the hauntingly beautiful dance work, makes perfect sense. After all, this tale from ancient Russian myth features a prince who falls for a woman (Odette) who has been transformed by an evil baron into a swan. Amid the protestations of undying love there is betrayal, tragedy and death. The dancing here is so breathlessly passionate, purely because it exists right on that fine line between love and pain.\nHouston Ballet\u2019s production, which comes to Dubai Opera this week, takes its initial inspiration from pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse\u2019s 1888 work The Lady of Shalott. It makes sense: it\u2019s a painting depicting the Tennyson poem where a maiden in love with Sir Lancelot defies her curse for a moment of freedom. Choreographed by Australian director and artistic director Stanton Welch, his Swan Lake \u2013 which premiered in 2006 \u2013 opens by referring directly to The Lady of Shalott; Odette floating on the lake in a boat, to meet the fate that will eventually befall her.\nWelch has certainly received plenty of plaudits for the way in which his interpretation of Swan Lake both stays true to the ideals of the 19th-century production and finds relevances for 21st century audiences enticed by the likes of Darren Aronofsky\u2019s dark, cinematic and Oscar-nominated take on the tale, Black Swan.\nIn Welch\u2019s version, we see the characters trapped by the evil Baron Von Rothbart\u2019s swan spell as women as well as swans, and there\u2019s a far greater emphasis on the male dancers, who in the traditional show enjoy a lot of stage time, but not a huge amount of steps.\nThey certainly do. Indeed, one of the most interesting versions of recent times is Matthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake, back on tour and replacing the female corps-de-ballet with a menacing male ensemble. The menace in Houston Ballet\u2019s version \u2013 particularly in Rothbart\u2019s all-black outfit complete with cape \u2013 is similarly important amid the graceful beauty and emotional charge of the libretto.\nDubai audiences will enjoy that full emotional charge, too; this touring version features the entire three-hour score, complete with live orchestra and sumptuous set design.

The Hamptons?\nLook instead to what people often call the \u201cinner city\u201d \u2014 because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the sharpest increase in the city\u2019s property tax assessments, which were released this week.\nThat\u2019s bad news if you\u2019re the one paying the property taxes, of course. But it\u2019s good news for homeowners and good news, too, for the rejuvenation of the city core.\nThe part of the city that saw the greatest jump in property values was Central McDougall.\nBetween July 2015 and July 2016, assessed property values for houses in Central McDougall jumped by 12 per cent, even while average property assessment in Edmonton over that period actually declined 2.7 per cent.\nThe average assessed value in the area went to $304,750 from $272,000 in just 12 months.\nOver the last five years, in fact, property assessments in Central McDougall have climbed five per cent \u2014 easily outpacing the rest of the city, where property taxes went up just 1.98 per cent over the same period.\nAnd Central McDougall isn\u2019t alone.

Some may want to attribute the change to the expansion of the MacEwan campus, or the opening of the Metro LRT line.\nBut maybe the property increases around the city centre have as much to do with a change in perception as anything else, as young couples and families looking for affordable homes opt for vibrancy and convenience over the long commutes from far-flung starter suburbs.\nNow, we do need a little mathematical context here.\nThese particular urban communities don\u2019t actually have a lot of single-family homes, so when a few homes go up in value, they can have a disproportionate influence on the neighbourhood average.\nIt\u2019s also true that when a $250,000 house goes up in value by $25,000, it\u2019s a bigger percentage increase than it would be if a $750,000 house went up by $25,000.\nStill, the five-year trend in all four neighbourhoods is strong and steady.\nThis kind of urban renewal can be a mixed blessing, of course. It can raise taxes until seniors can\u2019t afford their homes. It can price first-time buyers out of the market.

The second man was injured but able to dig himself out of the snow.\nSearch and rescue teams from three counties joined several other agencies in starting a search effort but had to delay past Thursday night because of darkness and further avalanche danger.

It's about the choices of a whole culture.\nOvereating \u2014 and subsequent obesity \u2014 has become a national issue. Michelle Obama spent most of the last eight years publicly addressing the topics of fitness and nutrition, serving as a benchmark of nutrition (where are we as a culture if the First Lady had to tell us to eat our vegetables?). However, it's wrong to assume that the obesity epidemic is due to a lack of willpower or personal failure, as is often the narrative. Johanna Ahola-Launonen of the University of Helsinki thinks the food environment is to blame.\n[M]ost eating decisions are made habitually and not consciously.\nThe modern food environment is a gluttonous smorgasbord of fat, sugar, and convenience. Comedian Patton Oswalt got poignant laughs for his bit about KFC\u2019s Famous Bowls calling them \u201ca failure pile in a sadness bowl.\u201d He did what great comedians do by shedding a light on that thing no one wants to talk about. In this case, it\u2019s our food culture, which encourages us to be one of the 1 billion served by McDonald\u2019s and eat our feelings because I bet you can\u2019t have just one. We love failure piles, sadness bowls, Lean Cuisines, and hating ourselves for loving those things. And why not? Everyone else is doing it.\nFat shaming and guilt tripping won\u2019t make people eat less.\nAhola-Launonen argues that most eating decisions are made habitually and not consciously. Humans tend to behave like those around them \u2014 if someone yawns or crosses their arms, we do the same. If the same is true for eating habits, then it makes sense we would overeat if everyone around us was doing the same. If we want to effect change in the obesity epidemic, it has to come from an environmental and cultural change. Fat shaming and guilt tripping won\u2019t make people eat less.\nThere\u2019s not an easy answer to ending the epidemic, but it could start with possibly taxing high-sugar foods, as Ahola-Launonen suggests, or curbing how we advertise food that will kill you, the way we have done with cigarettes. By making it a cultural issue instead of an individual one, we spread the responsibility. That may be a heavier weight than we were prepared for."}

Monday\u2019s episode was a parade of paradoxical moments\u2014even more than usual. Sure, there were a few predictable story beats: Heather and Colton finally took care of the former\u2019s \u201cNever Been Kissed\u201d status with a climactic smooch under literal fireworks, because subtlety is dead. This vaulted Heather to \u201cHas Been Kissed\u201d status, and culminated the kind of drawn-out arc that\u2019s become this franchise\u2019s bread and butter.

First, Elyse melted down over the fact that she is, in fact, on a dating competition show, sharing her 26-year-old hunk of man meat with a busload of other women. What began as a vulnerable conversation quickly morphed into an unexpected breakup: suddenly panicked at the prospect of being proposed to by someone who has been dating other women, Elyse tearfully told Colton she just can\u2019t do this anymore. (Even though she was evidently feeling pretty good about her odds of making it all the way to that proposal.) By the time Elyse faced the camera for her exit interview, she was already crying, worried she\u2019d made a huge mistake by leaving\u2014but alas, that\u2019s one limo you just can\u2019t turn around.\nPlenty of other Bachelor-verse contestants have had meltdowns like Elyse\u2019s; most seasons feature at least one who somehow never got the memo about how this decades-old dating show works. (Never forget Peter Kraus, king of the clueless wonders.) But her flameout still felt pretty out-of-the-blue, especially this early in the season. Then again, if a single one-on-one date is all it takes to ignite Elyse\u2019s jealousy, perhaps it\u2019s for the best that she opted not to stick around.

Once nearly nonexistent, the budget for state compulsive gambling efforts has doubled from a decade ago and now includes millions of dollars for research, training, prevention and treatment. Some local governments, casinos, and others also offer prevention programs.\nYet experts say the full scope of the problem is much larger, with those receiving help representing about a fifth, or less, of California\u2019s population of out-of-control gamblers.\nThe program\u2019s focus remains concentrated in the state\u2019s four largest urban areas.

{"idx": "11185", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In its second bi-monthly meeting held on March 25 and 26 this year, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria delivered a pleasant surprise in the form of a minor cut to the Monetary Policy Rate from 14 per cent to 13.5 per cent. It was the first time the MPR would be tinkered with since July 2016. The MPC points to the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables as well as the need to signal a new direction that is pro-growth as justification for the 50 basis-point reduction. Specifically, the Committee was emboldened by the continued moderation in inflationary pressure and the stability in the foreign exchange market. Although still in breach of the CBN's upper band target of 9 per cent, headline inflation slowed to 11.31 percent in February 2019 from a peak of 18.72 in January 2017 according to the National Bureau of Statistics. On the external front, the MPC equally found solace in the moderate improvement in crude oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves especially against the backdrop of current developments in the oil futures market which indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the federal government's 2019 budget benchmark. Equally heartwarming for the monetary authority is the trend of declining long term yields in the United States of America in the wake of the Federal Reserve's shift to a more dovish stance and the likelihood that capital flows in the medium term may be redirected to frontier and emerging markets including Nigeria.\nWithout any doubt, this move by the MPC bodes well for the Nigerian economy which requires a great deal of real-sector traction to achieve full recovery and inclusive growth. Typically, as the MPR-which is the rate at which banks borrow money from the CBN- is reduced, the banks in turn are expected to pass on the benefits to customers by reducing interest rates on loans. Admittedly, a 50 basis-point reduction may not be significant to translate to lower lending rates in the near term, explaining in part why financial markets' reaction to the surprise rate cut seemed subdued. The equities market, for instance, closed in the red with the All Share Index shedding 0.67 per cent on Wednesday being the first trading day following the announcement of the rate cut and only managed to eke out a gain of 0.01 per cent at the close of trading the following day. Nevertheless, the MPC decision has opened the door, which seemed shut for about 33 months, to subsequent rate cuts in the medium term. Going forward, against the backdrop of benign inflation, an accommodative monetary policy will provide room for increased channeling of credit to the real sector thereby reducing the cost of funds for many small and medium enterprises. The capital market stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment given that some of the increased liquidity will likely flow into the equities market. It will also be positive for the government's fiscal position arising from cheaper bonds' issuance considering that part of this year's budget deficit will be financed through borrowing from the domestic capital market.\nIt goes without saying that a dovish monetary policy stance is only enabled by low inflation and on this score the fiscal authorities equally have a role to play. This is consistent with the fiscal theory of price level (FTPL) which postulates that the price level is primarily determined by government debt and fiscal policy with monetary policy playing an indirect role contrary to the monetarist view that considers money supply as the primary determinant of inflation.

One of them is destroyed, but the other two successfully land on the planet. Before the cosmonauts reunite, they come to grips with scary monsters, a volcanic eruption, and alien life full of fears.\nThe iconic Soviet film served as a \u201ccreative playground\u201d for Peter Bogdanovich's 1968 \u201cVoyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women\u201d and Curtis Harrington's \u201cVoyage to the Prehistoric Planet\u201d.\nDecades later, when Georges Lucas was in Moscow during the time of perestroika, he asked the authorities to help him meet Klushantsev. When the officials replied that his name did not ring a bell, Lucas allegedly answered: \u201cHe\u2019s the Godfather of Star Wars\u201d.\nOne of film\u2019s true greats, Klushantsev worked on inventing the new resources in film which could enable him to create galaxies, starships, aliens, and robots that did not look fake from top to bottom.\nParadoxically enough, Klushantsev was one of Russia\u2019s most underestimated foremost filmmakers.

The dream, however, did not come true until much later, when Klushantsev already made a name for himself as a filmmaker and director of photography.\nSpecial effects artist and film historian Robert Skotak, who has won two Academy Awards for \u201cThe Terminator\u201d and \u201cAliens\u201d, reportedly came to Russia back in the nineties to ask Klushantsev about his signature shooting techniques.

Jahnke's first court appearance will be Dec. 18 at 8:30 a.m. at the Brown County Courthouse in New Ulm.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, on Jan. 20, 2010, Special Agent Vern Vandeberg of the Wisconsin Department of Justice\u2013Division of Criminal Investigation, was working undercover as a 15-year-old female on a Minnesota Yahoo online chat room when he received an instant message from a screen name that was later identified as belonging to Jahnke.\nThe documents state that during the online conversation, Jahnke discussed explicit sexual acts with the undercover agent who Jahnke believed to be a 15-year-old female. The complaint goes on to say that Jahnke also sent several explicit photos and expressed a desire to \"meet up\" with who he believed to be the young female. He also sent two photos of a vehicle, according to documents, that investigators used to trace back to Jahnke.\nAfter terminating the chat session with Jahnke, according to the complaint, Agent Vandeberg used the information provided by Jahnke to conduct a query that revealed Jahnke's full name and address.\nAccording to details in the complaint on Jan. 21, 2010, Agent Vandeberg again received an instant message from Jahnke and again engaged in the electronic conversation with Jahnke, posing as the same 15-year-old girl. Jahnke went on to describe explicit sexual acts and expressed interest again in meeting who he believed was the young woman. Later that day, Agent Vandeberg also received several e-mails from Jahnke.\nAt that time, according to the complaint, Agent Vandeberg contacted Sgt. William Haider of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA)\u2013Internet Crimes Against Children division and informed him of the acts taking place.\nOn Sept. 5, 2012, Special Agent Michael Anderson of the BCA received a communication from Investigator Leah Krenz at the Office of the Brown County Sheriff requesting assistance with an Internet Crimes Against Children investigation involving Jahnke.\nAccording to the complaint, that same day Agent Anderson conducted an interview with Jahnke at the Brown County Law Enforcement Center. Jahnke admitted to frequenting Minnesota online chat rooms over the past several years and participating in sexually explicit conversations in those chat rooms. He also admitted to discussing meeting individuals for sexual encounters, saying, however, that he never made physical contact with anyone he met in chat rooms. Jahnke also admitted to sending pictures of himself to people he met in chat rooms.\nFor the past 15 years, Jahnke was employed by KNUJ Radio and had been the voice behind the \"Morning Mess\" show held weekday mornings.\nIn August 2012, Jahnke resigned from his position at KNUJ."}

He declined to disclose the identity of the lawmakers.\nUnder the agreement, Fernandez said, leaders agreed to fast-track the anti-sanctuary city bills \u2014 including Senate Bill 168 \u2014 through committee stops while e-Verify proposals would languish without a single hearing.\nFernandez, chairman of MBF Healthcare Partners, a private Coral Gables investment firm, is also the co-chair of the American Business Immigration Coalition. The coalition advocates for providing opportunities for immigrants and foreign students to enter the U.S. workforce legally and establishing a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.\n\u201cDriving Latinos and immigrants out of our community, economy and Republican Party, no matter where the targeting is occurring, has the same outcome: loss of workers, tax revenue, voters, while threatening the safety of all Floridians when immigrants do not trust the police,\u201d he wrote.\nOne state agency official, one Tallahassee lobbyist and one state senator confirmed they heard secondhand that the deal was made.\n\u201cI think that we have limited ourselves to in respect to immigration in [Senate Bill 168], which is the bill that Sen.

Rene Plasencia, an Orlando Republican who chairs the Workforce Development and Tourism Subcommittee that is the first stop for the House\u2019s e-Verify bill, also declined to comment on why the bill has not yet been heard. That bill is being sponsored by Rep. Thad Altman, an Indialantic Republican.\nE-Verify has had a long, contentious history before the Florida Legislature. During his 2010 campaign, former Gov. Rick Scott called for all businesses in Florida to use e-Verify. He also signed an executive order shortly after taking office in 2011 that required state agencies under his direction to verify the employment eligibility of all new employees by using e-Verify.\nAn immigration crackdown bill that was amended to require e-Verify later failed on the Senate floor that year. At the time, then-Sen. JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, who was the deciding vote against the proposal, called e-Verify and other immigration verification tools \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d Alexander is a farmer and citrus grower who uses the system.\nHistorically, the state\u2019s largest business groups have opposed using e-Verify, including the Florida Chamber of Commerce and Associated Industries of Florida.\nGov.

Internet journalists agree that startup will change the world. Establishment types worry that startup will change the world, fighting back with PR professionals, lobbyists, and lawyers. Government regulators question the company's practices. Internet journalists question them too. Startup fights back with PR professionals, lobbyists, and lawyers.\nThe difference this time is that the startup isn't hawking an internet search engine or a ride-hailing app. It's hawking a reasonable facsimile of the chicken egg. Three years after embarking on a sweeping effort to build a cheaper, safer, and all-around healthier egg using all-natural plant proteins, Silicon Valley startup Hampton Creek is facing The Big Backlash. All Silicon Valley startups reach this point, somewhere along the way\u2014though the backlash is perhaps more extreme in the case of Hampton Creek.\nWhich will win? The side with the best PR professionals, lawyers, and lobbyists.\nIn early August, fueled by disgruntled ex-Hampton Creek employees, Business Insider published a story questioning both the company's ethics and its science, raising doubts over how Hampton Creek portrayed its egg-less products, which include cookie dough and mayonnaise. Three weeks later, the Food and Drug Administration told the startup that its eggless mayonnaise can't be called mayonnaise. And by the beginning of September, a Freedom of Information Act request turned up emails showing that the American Egg Board\u2014the egg-industry marketing organization (\"incredible edible eggTM\") overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014had marshaled PR professionals and other forces in an effort to blunt the startup's progress and perhaps even encourage unfavorable treatment from the FDA and others.\nNaturally, Hampton Creek is in fight-back mode. It played a role in the widespread distribution of those FOIA-ed emails\u2014an MIT researcher with connections to one Hampton Creek co-founder acquired the emails, before Hampton Creek helped distribute them to journalists\u2014and now, it's pushing for added leverage.\nThe latest: Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick tells WIRED that the company is lobbying congressman and senators in both parties to launch an investigation of the American Egg Board and the USDA. Though the AEB is funded by the egg industry, it's overseen by the government, and government rules forbid the board from trying to influence government policy or badmouth competing products.\nThe Egg Board tells us it's \"extremely confident\" it has not broken any laws. But Tetrick and company are pushing the issue. \"They're doing stuff that most folks would constitute as a illegal,\" Tetrick says of the Egg Board. \"We're very close to an announcement of a Congressional investigation. This is about deeper reform in the food system. The whole point of [Hampton Creek] is to make food better.\"\nIn short, Tetrick still wants to change the world. But there are many working against him, and naturally, it's unclear whether he can succeed.

Since the gazetting of the NHI bill on the 21st of June 2018, some neoliberal economists and political parties, to name a few have launched a scathing attack on the bill as well as the NHI policy.\nThis is not surprising because we know that these so called organisations have no interest in policies that seek to address South Africa's inequality crises and the fulfilment of section 27 of the constitution ,as well as article 12 of the United Nations Covenant on Economic, social and cultural Rights of 1966, which provides for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\nThe National Health Insurance represents a policy shift that necessitates a mass reorganisation of the current health system. This mass reorganisation affects both the public and private sector in order to redress the inequality in the current provision of health care with approximately 4.4% of GDP in health expenditure benefiting only 16 % of the population and 4.1% of GDP benefiting the remaining 84% of the population, who are predominantly black victims of an evil Apartheid regime. There is a tinge of racism that fuels the criticism of NHI because the beneficiaries of apartheid separate development want to protect their inherited privileges.\nIt is not surprising that the notion of a more equitable distribution is threatening to the private sector and its supporters. Its profitability thrives on the current inequalities and public sector inefficiencies. COSATU calls on all of its members and like minded individuals and civil society partners to rally behind and defend the NHI policy and any legislative enabling reforms that bring us a step closer to the realisation of Universal Health Coverage.\nCOSATU vehemently rejects the ridiculous pronouncement by the daily maverick that South Africa already has Universal access to health. Life Esidimeni in the Gauteng Department of Health and the oncology crises in Kwa-Zulu Natal are testament to the lack of universal health coverage for the poorest of the poor in South Africa. Universal Health coverage in South Africa is a benefit that only the rich enjoy.\nThe NHI policy is separate from the Minister of Health. Many distracters of the NHI have formed an unhealthy link between the NHI policy and the Minister of Health with some critiquing the Minister's performance using the policy. It's as though any shortcoming as a result of the Minister and the NHI is automatically a shortcoming of the NHI policy.\nCOSATU wants to clarify that Minister Aaron Motsoaledi is not the NHI, the NHI will remain a policy of government with or without him as a Minister of health and therefore we cannot continue to bond any policy of government for that matter with one particular person. NHI is not only bigger than one Minister but it is also bigger than one administration and ultimately must out live us all in order to benefit generations to come.\nThe NHI's distracters religiously point to the pre-concluded unaffordability of the NHI as a deterrent for implementation; the NHI bill provides the enabling legislative reform to establish the NHI fund which is essential in the financing of health benefits for the end user.\nCOSATU welcomes the release of the NHI bill; the bill is the first piece of legislation that brings South Africa closer to the realisation of universal"}

Over the decades, they've garnered a devoted fan base, a secret society that gawps incredulously if you claim you've managed to detect the band's existence too. They are the elusive Higgs boson particle of the indie world. This, their twelfth album, comes out on January 6th; if you're not a die-hard, attending the annual sell-out Yuletide shindig at Bristol's Fleece (the independent venue that they own and run), you can get to know them better on their national tour in January. You may also get to meet the band's dancer Wojtek, the Polish Bez.\n'Welcome, Stranger!' may sound inclusive as a title, but the lyrical absurdity and abstraction may disorient an unwitting drifter into the Aeroplanes' airspace, with songs about Elvis impersonation, map reading or dead trees blatantly yanking commercialism's chain. Its fundamental whimsy, however, proves an endearing strength, its underlying positivity also keeping it refreshing. Front man Gerard Langley's speak-singing will always divide opinion, but let's not pretend that approach ever marred Laurie Anderson or Lou Reed's critical reception.\n'Elvis Festival' starts with solo drums, then power chords interspersed with thumping cowbell donks. It celebrates eccentricity, inclusivity and acceptance (\"You sing, badly,/ But you are Elvis./ They'll exempt you, gladly,/ For you are Elvis.\"). The recurring guitar riff from 'Here is the Heart of All Wild Things' (which champions bravery in the face of the unknown or unpredictable) could so easily be off Radiohead's 'A Moon-shaped Pool'. The song ends with a barrage of distorted 1991 Wedding Present 'Seamonsters' guitars. 'Nothing Will Ever Happen In The Future' reminds you to seize the day and \"Put your own house in order,/ Or someone else will do it for you,\" with a Neil Young guitar line and a refrain that nostalgically invokes the BBC theme for 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Conversely, 'Sweet Like Chocolate' is a tad syrupy once its AC/DC intro has elapsed, and 'Skin' and 'Poetland' feel rather like ballast.\nLangley sums up their output as, \"always a bit of a party, with some intellectual sh*t thrown in.\" As 'art-rock', this album throws more focus on the textured rock sound that having three guitarists brings, and less on the arty allusions you can find in previous works (setting Plath's \"The Applicant\" to music on 'Swagger').

Of course, this incident has been raised to the point of sensationalism. It has been like throwing \u2018white Tofu to the animal rights radicals\u2019 who are already demanding the tiger exhibit be permanently closed. Although this is a tragic incident, the fact that such incidents are very uncommon is being ignored by the press. So, instead of focusing on what went wrong at the SF zoo that day, this paper will try and examine what didn\u2019t go wrong, and show that there were other forces at work that inadvertently (or intentionally) have added up to make this situation that much worse.\nThe first thing I want to point out is that a number of people died on Christmas Day in San Francisco. I do not have exact statistics, but I am sure there were some fatal car accidents in the Bay area. There are fatal accidents every day, and these kinds of accidents do not take breaks on holidays. But, did you hear of any of them in the news? No, you probably didn\u2019t. Are the people killed in these accidents any less dead than the boy killed by the tiger? No. It is also very likely the boy who was killed in the tiger attack suffered less then do many vehicle accident victims. You don\u2019t hear about that, either.\nThere are two persistent \u2018observations\u2019 about this incident that keep coming out, and are very likely the truth.\n2.) The tiger escaped by jumping a moat wall.\nLets look at number 1 first. You cannot design anything that can prevent every accident every time when the cause is deliberate human stupidity. In the weeks before this incident, there was a man killed in a zoo in India because he crossed over the barrier fence, to try and get a better picture of a tiger. He was being warned not to cross the fence by officials, but did so, anyway. He stuck his hand and camera inside the fence. Both tigers then attacked him. A day or two later, a young girl crossed the barrier at another zoo in Malaysia, and gets clawed by a leopard. The parents were there and did not stop the girl. Unlike this country, the zoo can press charges against the parents for failure to properly control their child. Then, just 5 days after the fatal incident in India, another man jumps into a tiger enclosure at another zoo in India. This man escaped with fairly minor injuries, but he was dragged around a bit by a tiger. Turns out this is the second time in a year that this man has done this.\nThe point of all of this is they human stupidity can trump the best enclosure design. The only way to make a tiger exhibit completely safe from idiots is to not build it. And, I can think of plenty of good reasons to build a tiger exhibit despite the idiots.\nNow, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a reasoned look at number 2. The San Francisco Zoo\u2019s tiger \u2018grotto\u2019 was built in the 1940\u2019s. This was at a time when most zoos were keeping their big cats in barred cages. This exhibit was nearly two decades ahead of its time when it was built, and was undoubtedly quite a sensation. One of the unique features of this exhibit was the use of a \u2018dry moat\u2019\u2013 a feature that eliminated the need for any kind of a visible barrier between the animals and the general public. The moat is 33 feet across\u2013 farther then even the most athletic t"}

A standard renter\u2019s policy protects your personal property, in many cases of theft or damage, and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged and unlivable. It may also protect you from personal liabilities.\nWould my landlord\u2019s insurance cover me?\nAlmost always no. Your personal items such as clothes, stereo, furniture, laptops, etc. are not covered by your landlord\u2019s insurance. Usually, the landlord carries insurance that will only cover their loss when their property has been destroyed or damaged in some way.\nWould my parent\u2019s insurance cover me?\nPossibly. If you\u2019re a full-time college student and part of your parent\u2019s household, their homeowners or renter\u2019s insurance may provide you with some coverage for your residence hall room, but more than likely not in an off campus apartment.\nWho should purchase Renter\u2019s Insurance?\nAnyone who rents a place to live. Under most circumstances, the landlord\u2019s policy will not pay for losses to tenants\u2019 personal property or damages caused by the tenant. Property losses are usually unexpected. Insurance is a means of protection in case such losses should occur.\nWhat is covered or is not covered?\nTalk with an insurance agent to understand their array of policies and coverage options. Normal coverage may include fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, vehicles, sudden or accidental damage from smoke, water damage from plumbing, and theft. Floods, normal wear and tear, earthquakes, and waterbed damages may not be covered. Check with an agent, as some policies may include these factors or coverage may be available to purchase.\nHow do I determine what coverage is right for me?\nMost insurance companies have household inventory sheets to aid in calculating how much coverage is needed. Complete coverage may cost as much as two hundred dollars or less per year depending upon location. Shop around and compare prices. Renter\u2019s insurance is a small price to pay for protection.\nHow do I get Renter\u2019s Insurance?\nIt\u2019s easy. If you have a car, talk to the agent who does your car insurance. Ask your family members for contact information for agents they have had good experiences with. Your realtor may also be able to give you some information on where to go as well.\nIn making a claim for theft, there must be a police report. It is also a good idea to have a list and pictures of your belongings.

And among this new space flotilla were small satellites representing the vanguard for a new generation of global surveillance.\nHungry for more data, Global Fishing Watch, a collaboration among conservation group Oceana, technology giant Google, and environmental nonprofit SkyTruth, is eager to use those new satellites to see \u201call the ships, all the time,\" creating an indispensable tool for catching illegal activity on the high seas.\n\u201cIt is now within the foreseeable future that you can expect to be able to track every vessel on the surface of the earth,\u201d says Tony Long, Global Fishing Watch\u2019s CEO.\nIn 2016 Global Fishing Watch started with data from the radio beacons all ships carry to avoid collisions, mapping their movements to spot fishing in illegal areas. However, ship captains can counter such surveillance by simply turning the beacons off\u2014a potentially dangerous measure that removes them from the map.\nIn order to circumvent this shady behavior, Global Fishing Watch started supplementing beacon locations with data from earth-observation satellites. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) maps cloud cover. But with some smart processing, Global Fisher Watch used their data to locate small, bright patches at night, such as floodlights used for squid fishing.\nBut satellite imagery is only useful on clear days, and while the NOAA imagery is free, the price for commercial data far exceeded Global Fishery Watch\u2019s budget.\nThey needed new tools if they ever hoped to keep a watchful eye on the world's oceans.\nThe European Space Agency launched Sentinel-1A, the first of four satellites, on a mission to map sea-ice cover, assist forest management, and tackle other large-scale tasks. But by using new algorithms, Global Fishing Watch could pick up reflections from the metal hulls of individual ships in the earth's oceans.\nBut radar satellites are rare and expensive. Sentinel-1, launched in 2014, is the size of an SUV and weighs two tons, and radar imagery demand far outpaces supply.\nICEYE's original aim, much like that of Sentinel-1, was observing ice cover and monitoring dangerous icebergs but similarly its radar could be tweaked for spotting ships as well. In early 2018, the company launched its prototype ICEYE-X1 to prove the technology and ICEYE-X2, their first commercial satellite, was put into orbit in early"}

That's more than double the $634 billion 'down payment' President Barack Obama set aside for health reform in his budget, raising the prospect of sticker shock at a time of record federal spending. Administration officials have pointedly avoided providing a ballpark estimate, saying it depends on details to be worked out with Congress.\n\"It's impossible to put a price tag on the plan before even the basics have been finalized,\" said White House spokesman Reid Cherlin. \"Here's what we do know: The reserve fund in the president's budget is fully paid for and provides a substantial down payment on the cost of the reforming our health care system.\"\nStill, the potential runaway costs are raising concerns among Republicans and some Democrats as Congress prepares to draft next year's budget. The U.S. spends $2.4 trillion a year on health care, more than any other advanced country. And some experts estimate that a third or more of that goes for tests and procedures that provide little or no benefit.\n\"We shouldn't just be throwing more money on top of the present system, because the present system is so wasteful,\" said Sen.

Taxpayers will get a better idea when congressional committees try to draft legislation later this year. \"Until that gets revealed by the Congress, it would be highly premature for the president to assert that sort of number,\" Nichols said.\nWhite House budget director Peter Orszag told the House Budget Committee earlier this month that the president's $634 billion fund is \"likely to be the majority of the cost.\" Roughly half of the money would come from spending cuts, and the other half from tax increases.\nBut whether the $634 billion represents 50 percent, 60 percent, or 70 percent of the cost \"will depend on the details of whatever is finally done...as we move through the legislative process,\" Orszag added.\n\"We are dealing with huge numbers,\" said David Walker, a former U.S. comptroller general and now head of the Peter G.

Supporters defended the laws as necessary to prevent fraud at the polls.\nAll this controversy has left many voters uneasy, and raised questions about how confident Americans are that their votes count, and will be counted accurately in November.\nSo far at least, voters do seem to have faith that the system works. Most say they're confident \u2014 at least somewhat \u2014 that their votes will be counted correctly.\nCharles Stewart, a political scientist at MIT, says that's crucial in a democracy.\n\"Ultimately the legitimacy of government rests on the belief among the losers that it was a fair fight,\" he says.\nStewart has asked voters for years about their experiences at the polls. And he's found, for the overwhelming majority of voters, things go surprisingly well.\nIn surveys after the 2012 and 2014 elections, at least 97 percent of voters said their polling places were run \"very well.\" Most people waited less than 10 minutes to vote. Very few people had problems with voting machines.

That's especially true this year, with all the uproar over the primary system.\n\"No average person has any idea how that operates,\" says Atkeson. \"And so when the candidates get up and say, 'Hey, this isn't a fair process,' I mean, those are cues to their voters that there's something wrong with the process.

The full interview is at this link. The piece reveals the concussion tests that Bryan undergoes after each match.\nBryan returns to the backstage area after each match and has to go through a series of tests, ending with a math problem. According to ESPN, Bryan must multiply 8 by 3, then multiply that number by 3, and divide it all by 4. If Bryan can't come up with the correct answer, he's not cleared to continue wrestling.\nWWE doctors perform these tests on Bryan following any physical activity in the ring. The tests begin with Bryan getting his eyes checked. He then goes through several balance tests, then ends with the math equation. Doctors use the simple tests to make sure Bryan's brain is functioning properly. These show how WWE is not taking any chances with Bryan, who has suffered 10 documented concussions.\n\"The big concern with concussions is that, this has happened to me in the past, you don't know you had a concussion and your instinct as an athlete is to say, 'Hey, I'm fine,'\" Bryan told ESPN. \"What we do now ensures that doesn't happen.\"\nESPN notes that WWE put this very specific concussion protocol in place after Bryan was cleared to return to the ring by an independent group of concussion experts, neurologists and neurosurgeons, and WWE medical director Joseph Maroon, back in March 2018. Bryan returned to the ring last year after being forced to retire in February 2016 due to the discovery of a lesion on his brain and a history of concussions.\nBryan claims he feels \"really, really good\" and has suffered no setbacks since returning to the ring in 2018 but WWE is sticking to the strict series of tests. Bryan hopes the positive test results will lead to a return to a normal routine.\n\"It's still pretty much the same, but we're working on loosening it up a little bit because our doctors do have to look after other people, right?\" Bryan said, chuckling. \"So it's like, I go out, I do a match and I'm fine and they're having to do all these tests with me, so we're working on loosening that up a little bit. But that's more of a thing as far as getting everything legally to where we could do that sort of thing.\"\nBryan continues to work a lighter schedule and the fact he's suffered no setbacks is attributed to that.

But a handful of companies are reinventing batteries, making them connected devices that can cut utility bills without an upfront investment.\nSanta Clara, CA-based Green Charge Networks said Tuesday it has raised $56 million from K Road DG, a private equity firm focused on distributed energy, to scale up its business. The company intends to expand from operations in New York and California into Texas and Hawaii, a company representative says.\nGreen Charge Networks, along with a few other startups including Milbrae, CA-based Stem and San Francisco-based SolarCity, are creating a new market for distributed energy storage. This technology is cost-effective in only a few states now, but it\u2019s a sign of innovation that\u2019s happening at the intersection of cloud computing and energy storage.\nThese companies install and operate large lithium-ion battery packs (a single 30-kilowatt Green Charge battery is bigger than a refrigerator) equipped with software and controls that monitor how a building uses energy. By analyzing power usage trends, the systems decide the best times for charging the battery from the grid or powering a building off the battery. The key is to lower consumption during so-called peak hours\u2014typically in the late afternoon and early evening\u2014when utilities charge commercial and industrial customers fees for the maximum amount of power they use.\nIn the case of Green Charge Networks, business customers, such as hotels or apartment buildings, don\u2019t need to purchase the equipment. Instead, the battery provider owns the equipment and can finance the installation through the power savings. This is a business model often used by energy efficiency companies that fund equipment upgrades, such as heating or lighting, in buildings through ongoing energy savings.\nOne of the challenges that the early entrants into this market face is differentiating their products. The batteries themselves are commodity products, albeit relatively expensive ones, but the algorithms for saving money and complementary software to help building managers manage energy could provide a way to stand out. Getting access to capital to finance new installations is also a challenge all these companies will need to address.\nIn many ways, the battery industry is following the same trajectory as solar energy. The prices of products are coming down; in the case of lithium-ion batteries, this is aided by economies of scale from the electric vehicle industry. More important, though, is the emergence of financing options, which allow people to lower their energy bills without any initial investment. In the case of solar, financing in the form of leases helped fueled the rapid growth in residential solar over the past few years and is now more common than customer purchases.\nSmart batteries in buildings can only be financed in states that have relatively high peak-hour rates. But if distributed storage startups can figure out how to make the economics work in other states, many more building owners will have a reason to look at batteries."}

Stagnant or declining rates could shrink the number of working-age Europeans by 20 million a year over the next 15 years, the commission predicted. The result: Europe would go from four working-age residents to two for each retiree by 2050.\n\u2022 When Germany reported a miniscule uptick of 600 births in the first quarter, Ursula von der Leyen, federal minister for Family Affairs, said the numbers \"filled me with delight.\"\n\u2022The Scotsman newspaper heralded \"a new baby boom\" after first-quarter data showed 646 more babies were born in Scotland than in the same period in 2006.\n\u2022France's health minister declared government financial incentives for new parents a success in January, when statistics showed that women there gave birth to more children in 2006 than in any single year since 1981. France pays a working parent about $1,000 a month for a year to stay at home to raise a third child.\nDemographers such as Butz are reluctant to celebrate. \"Something is going on,\" he says. \"The uptick is real, but we don't know what is causing it or whether it will last.\"\nThe boomlets aren't taking place everywhere. Fertility rates in Spain and Portugal are relatively flat. Rates in the Netherlands, Norway and Austria have slipped.\nThe USA's fertility rate in 2005 was higher than any country in Europe except Iceland, according to PRB tracking.\nBirthrates in Scandinavian nations are among Europe's highest. Those countries give up to 18 months of parental leave and free or subsidized childcare, in addition to paying working mothers to take time off.\nNations with low rates have increasingly turned to more generous payouts. Last month, Spain approved payments of $3,400 for every new child. This year, Germany began Elterngeld \u2014 \"parents' money\" payments.

It\u2019s easy to think of frontline staff such as doctors, nurses and other such professionals directly saving lives and helping people.\nBut there are so many different parts of healthcare that help save lives, some of which include the pharmaceutical and biotechnology aspects.\nShire is a global biopharma giant focused on serving people with rare diseases and other highly specialised conditions, such as haemophilia, epilepsy and Hunter syndrome.\nThe company is currently developing a new, innovative biologics manufacturing facility in Dunboyne, Co Meath. Earlier this year, Siliconrepublic.com met site lead Susan Hynes at the NIBRT Careers in Biopharma event.\nHynes said they were at the event to \u201cmeet some of the best talent\u201d in the industry.\nShe said they are looking for a wide range of candidates, including graduates, people who have switched industries and are looking to upskill, and those who have a bit more experience but are thinking of making a change.\nShire announced the new facility two years ago and, with the building nearing completion, Hynes said what they will be doing is at the cutting edge of innovation."}

(AP) \u2014 Oilers coach Ken Hitchcock says he wasn\u2019t thanking his lucky stars when the Buffalo Sabres muffed two chances to score into an open net in the final eight minutes of Edmonton\u2019s 4-3 win on Monday night.\nInstead, Hitchcock began believing the bad bounces the Oilers experienced during a 1-8-2 slump were finally evening out.\nAnd yes, that included hanging on for the win despite Oilers star Connor McDavid missing an open net in the final minute of a game Edmonton overcame a 3-1 deficit.\nThe Oilers scored three times over the final 3:31 of the second period, with Kyle Brodziak credited with the go-ahead goal with five seconds remaining. He was driving to the front of the net, when Adam Larsson\u2019s shot from the left point deflected in off his skate.\nLeon Draisaitl scored his team-leading 41st and added an assist, to extend his point streak to 11 games in which he had combined for nine goals and eight assists. McDavid had two assists, while Darnell Nurse and Zack Kassian also scored for Edmonton.\nMikko Koskinen stopped 35 shots, including the final 27 after allowing Jack Eichel to score Buffalo\u2019s third goal with 2:36 left in the first period, and earned two fortunate breaks to improve to 5-1-2 in his past eight.\nBuffalo\u2019s Jeff Skinner missed an open right side by directing a shot off the post with 7:34 left. Then with 3:40 remaining, Jason Pominville directed in Brandon Montour\u2019s pass through the crease, only to have his follow through hit the puck and sweep it back out before it crossed the goal line.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Pominville said of how the puck didn\u2019t go in.\nEichel scored twice and Casey Mittelstadt also scored for the slumping Sabres. Buffalo dropped to 2-7-1 in its past 10, and is 13-22-6 since a franchise-record-matching 10-game win streak in November.\nLinus Ullmark was yanked at the end of the second period after allowing four goals on 20 shots, and three on the final four shots he faced. Carter Hutton took over and stopped all seven shots he faced.\nWhile Buffalo continues its slide out of the playoff picture with a little over a month left, the Oilers continue making a late push.\nEdmonton (29-30-7) has 65 points and moved out of a three-way tie for 11th, inching to within 6 points of eighth-place Minnesota.\nDraisaitl even managed to giggle when reminded of McDavid\u2019s shot from the Sabres blue line missing the wide open net and hitting off the outside of the right post with under a minute left.\nThe Oilers not only picked up their captain\u2019s miscue but also that of Draisaitl, who was penalized for interference a few seconds later.\nThe Sabres appeared to take control when Eichel eluded defenseman Kris Russell, who dropped his stick, and scored by driving to the net to put Buffalo up 3-1 with 2:36 left."}

Her latest report, Market Data: Advanced Thermostats, looks at the growth trajectory of these devices.\nOver the past couple of years, advanced thermostats have seen a steady uptake and are reaching a higher level of market maturity.\nGoogle\u2019s acquisition of Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014 fueled the development of this market. Other high profile companies have since followed suit to carry this momentum forward. Amazon has invested in ecobee and tado, Centrica Connected Home has developed its Hive Active Heating brand with its acquisition of AlertMe, and Johnson Controls has recently released a Microsoft Cortana-embedded residential thermostat in response to market demand in the residential sector. These investments by major brands show how these devices are gaining in acceptance and becoming a staple in smart homes.\nConsumers are becoming increasingly aware of the potential energy savings, remote control capabilities, and comfort gains associated with advanced thermostats. More than half of the respondents in a 2016 survey said they were interested in a smart thermostat, a thermostat-based utility program, or a connected home platform in the next 5 years, according to an Accenture study of energy customers.\nSimultaneously, utilities in regulated markets are using these devices in demand-side management (DSM) programs to meet demand response (DR) and energy efficiency goals while increasing customer engagement and satisfaction.\nOther reasons for promoting smart thermostats include boosting customer satisfaction and engagement with more personalised, innovative solutions, increasing potential savings compared to that of programmable thermostats, and reducing CO2 emissions. In addition, ComEd has been working with Nest Labs\u2019 Rush Hour Rewards application since 2014 to offer bring your own thermostat (BYOT) DR through the Nest Learning Thermostat. The last program has grown to over 18,000 participants.\nEnergy suppliers in competitive markets and other types of service providers, like telecoms and security companies, are starting to use these devices to explore new revenue streams as traditional business models become threatened.\nFor example, Dutch energy supplier Eneco acquired Quby in 2015 as part of the company\u2019s targeted strategy to collaborate and innovate with tech startups to explore new sectors in the wake of a transforming energy industry, where energy suppliers can no longer rely solely on power sales. Quby\u2019s approach is to offer long-term contact holders in the Netherlands (and now Belgium and Spain) a discounted Toon smart thermostat, alongside services for checking energy waste, monitoring the boiler\u2019s performance, and preventing high bill shock for \u20ac4.50 (approximately $5) per month.\nWhile Eneco admits it is proceeding mostly by trial and error, these efforts have been successful in helping the company reduce customer churn, increase customer satisfaction, and transition into a different kind of service-based business.\nOther energy suppliers are exploring similar business models, like British Gas with HomeCare products, which charges customers between \u00a312 and \u00a320.50 ($15-$26) for the monitoring and servicing of major home equipment, such as the boiler, central heating, plumbing, drains, and home electronics.\nAdvanced thermostats are one of the few smart devices reaching a more mainstream level of maturity. There are still uncertainties around the actual performance of connected thermostats. This can be attributed to differences in user demographics, and the ways in which savings can be measured and evaluated (for instance,"}

For further perspective, consider that previous regional polls from the Bay Area Council showed higher faith in the area's direction: Last year, 55 percent of respondents said we were on the right track, and in 2014, 57 percent of them were optimistic.\nMeanwhile, 54 percent of poll respondents said they had no designs to leave the Bay Area. And while complaints were registered across incomes levels and generations, it was residents with household incomes of over $125,000 who felt most strongly that the area was headed in the right direction \u2014 though that was just 46 percent of them.\nIn a summary of the results, the Bay Area Council writes that, \"Those who've lived in the region for five or fewer years were the most likely to say they would leave.\" Ironically, if simplistically, recent transplants bear much of the popular blame for an increasingly steep cost of living, which respondents identified as the top problem facing the area.\nJust last month several sources were floating the idea that young tech workers might start fleeing the Bay Area, citing job searches for growing tech hubs in other regions. And seeming to address that population, Bay Area Council president and CEO Jim Wunderman wrote in a statement that \"losing even a fraction of that number (2 million residents) and the talent they represent because we failed to deal with our most pressing issues would be very bad.\"\nAre Tech Workers Starting To Flee SF For Jobs In Cheaper Towns?"}

This steep decline in productivity has been matched by a 25 percent decline in inflation-adjusted blue-collar construction wages (the median wage is just $35,000 per year) and housing prices that have soared as high as 54 percent in the Bay Area.\nPrevailing wage is a minimum wage for blue-collar construction work that reflects local market rates for different skilled crafts. Long associated with stronger economic outcomes and more local hiring, most research shows that prevailing wages have no significant impact on total project costs because they promote higher skilled craftsmanship.\nThis triggers increases in productivity and efficiency as high as 15 percent, reduced reliance on taxpayer funded public assistance programs, and prevents workforce shortages by helping to fund the apprenticeship programs that are used to meet California\u2019s construction workforce training needs.\n* Increase incomes of blue-collar workers by more than $1 billion.\n* Boost state and local tax revenues by at least $55 million.\n* Save taxpayers at least $30 million on public assistance expenditures.\nWith the Affordable Care Act facing an uncertain future, Lantsberg\u2019s analysis shows that 38 percent of full-time, blue-collar construction workers currently have no health care coverage and their Medicaid reliance is twice the national average for non-supervisory production workers.\nAccording to Economic Census data, California\u2019s 2014 Affordable Housing Cost Study and other federal data sources, construction wages and benefits comprise just 15 percent of total residential housing costs-substantially less than contractor earnings and developer fees (18 percent), and less than half the cost share of equipment, materials, fuels and purchased services (34 percent).\nImportantly, Lantsberg notes that neither labor costs nor materials have driven the increase in California\u2019s housing prices.

{"idx": "11266", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: I\u2019ve met many women who left corporate America to start their own businesses, usually because of the lack of family friendly work environments and fair pay and promotion. When women started their own firms, they wanted to change the workplace culture and the way business is done to support the competing responsibilities of work and family.\nAs business owners, women want to offer good benefits, but they are often at an unfair disadvantage without a minimum standard in place. When they do decide to offer fair wages and benefits, they run the risk of being undercut by the competition.\nThe U.S. Women\u2019s Chamber of Commerce strongly and enthusiastically endorses the earned sick time legislation because it supports small businesses, benefits workers and encourages an equitable workplace for women across the Commonwealth.\nAs a businesswoman and a native of Massachusetts, I support the earned sick time legislation that is currently being debated at the State House because it\u2019s a common sense proposal that provides numerous benefits to women, families, and businesses. Growing up in Wayland and later living on the North Shore, I have been a seasonal worker and I\u2019ve held various other jobs in Massachusetts. At all of my full-time jobs, I was lucky enough to have paid sick time. I appreciate this benefit so much more knowing that a vast number of people aren\u2019t as fortunate.\nWe need to fight for the over one million workers in Massachusetts who cannot risk taking a single day off to care for themselves or their families. For low-income workers, the lack of earned sick days is particularly problematic: 67 percent of the lowest-wage workers do not have access to sick days in Massachusetts. The majority of low-wage workers are women, making earned sick days a critical step in creating fair and equitable workplaces.\nWithout earned sick days, many women face the impossible choice of sending a sick child to school or coming to work sick for fear of losing income or their job. Betsy and JP Powel, who own Salt Marsh Pottery Studio in Dartmouth, employ seven women, many of whom are mothers and have been faced with this tough choice. For Betsy, the decision is simple: a sick child means her employee takes a day off. This kind of flexibility creates loyalty and reliability from employees who know that many other mothers have jobs without this immeasurable benefit.\nHaving a boss like Betsy Powel is rare, especially in corporate America where it\u2019s extremely challenging for women to balance careers and families. Even as women have an increased presence in the workforce, employers have failed to update procedures to reflect changes.\nWorkers fighting for this benefit are not asking for a handout. This bill allows employees to earn the sick time based on the hours they work. Many of our members are small businesses, and we are particularly encouraged by the ways in which the bill takes into account the needs of small businesses. It offers a tiered approach to the amount of time than can be earned depending on the size of the business, contains protections for businesses, and allows the flexibility needed to make the law easy to administer. The bill also addresses the needs of seasonal employers and allows them the option of providing paid or unpaid, job-protected sick time.\nThe earned sick time legislation will build a stronger economy and protect the families of Massachusetts."}

{"idx": "11272", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: - The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a fresh seven-month high this week, helped in-part by a weak US Dollar that started to test a long-term area of support. A pullback has started to appear off of those fresh seven-month highs as reports are circulating that President Trump gave the go-ahead to his aides to proceed with the $200b in additional tariffs on Chinese products. The big question is whether this pullback turns into something more, or whether buyers can hold the lows in a nearby zone of support potential.\n- Even if support above 26k is violated, there are two additional areas of interest for bullish continuation taken from swings that showed in the month of August.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has continued its topside run as the index has moved up to fresh seven-month highs. This comes after the week started with a test below near-term support, as we looked at on Tuesday. Prices dipped below 25,800, albeit temporarily, before buyers came back to regain control while driving up to those fresh post-January highs.\nTaking a step back, we can see where that support hold last week took place around the 76.4% retracement of the January-February sell-off in the index. This level had also helped to set swing-high resistance in late-August, so we have another example of prior resistance helping to hold new support in this theme of bullish continuation.\nGiven the earlier-week test through support, we had looked at a more conservative stance in the index in our last article on Tuesday. While we had previously looked to utilize support around 25,886 for topside plays, we cast those looks for longer-term support a bit deeper on the chart. Those did not come into play, as buyers grasped control and have continued to push into early-Friday trade.\nWe have, however, seen prices begin to pullback as reports have begun to circulate that President Trump is ordering aides to proceed ahead with tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese products. The pullback is mild at this early stage of the scenario, but this could produce a deeper retracement to open the door for approaches of bullish continuation.\nAt this point, traders can base those support plays on how aggressively they\u2019d like to move forward on the Dow. For those that want to retain an aggressive stance for bullish continuation, the zone that we\u2019ve begun to test could be of value. This zone runs from a zone of prior swing-lows/highs, and comprises the area from 26,038-26,081. Given how sloppy price action was leading into this week, traders would likely want to wait for a confirmed hold of this support into next week\u2019s open before acting; but it can remain as usable.\nA bit deeper, we\u2019ve adjusted our next-stop support level on the basis of that earlier-week dip. This can open the door for support around the 25,750 area that helped to hold the lows on Tuesday; and a bit deeper, that potential support around 25,500 remains. If we break below that, we\u2019re likely in the midst of some \u2018new\u2019 theme or scenario, and traders would likely want to take a step back from the bullish continuation approach, at least temporarily, until a more clear backdrop can be had."}

According to her report, black defendants were 4 \u00bd times more likely to be sentenced to death than similarly situated white defendants.

When, and perhaps only when, you\u2019re talking about one of the biggest blockbuster franchises of all time. Solo, Disney\u2019s attempt to engineer an origin story for the most devil-may-care smuggler in the galaxy far, far away, predictably topped the box office this Memorial Day weekend. But it did so with a four-day tally of \u201conly\u201d $103 million\u2014the kind of cash almost any movie would be lucky to make, but a bit soft for a Star Wars story in 2018. Even when counting Monday (it made $84 million between Thursday and Sunday night), Solo opened weaker than the last four entries in the series, including the 13-year-old Revenge Of The Sith. And it made way less than The Last Jedi did in its first weekend just five months ago.\nThe think pieces have already started rolling in, all speculating about why Solo isn\u2019t doing as well as Disney hoped/expected. (Projections of a debut in the $155 million Rogue One range were apparently wildly optimistic.) Are we seeing the first signs of Star Wars fatigue, what with less than half a year separating this prequel from the last official episode? Oversaturation hasn\u2019t hurt Marvel\u2019s returns, though maybe audiences just think of Star Wars as more of a special cultural event than a regular appointment. Did diehards still bent out of shape about The Last Jedi\u2019s subversion of franchise expectations actually boycott the new film? It\u2019s possible, but Solo is basically the anti-Last Jedi, so devoted to canon that it plays like the exact kind of fan service that Rian Johnson purposefully avoided. Maybe the multiplex is just too crowded with blockbuster options right now; the $55 million second-place finisher Deadpool 2 made in its second weekend\u2014and the $21 million third-place finisher Infinity War made in its fifth\u2014almost certainly put a dent in Solo\u2019s debut. Some seem to think that the film\u2019s production woes may have hurt attendance, but that\u2019s putting a lot of stock in the idea that the average moviegoer cares as much as entertainment journalists do about behind-the-scenes troubles.\nThe good news for Disney is that rival studios were so spooked by the mere presence of a new Star Wars movie that they\u2019ve given Solo quite the runway: No major studio films are opening this week, and the only remotely formidable competition next week is Ocean\u2019s 8. After that, it\u2019s another week until The Incredibles 2 comes along to steal away the family demographic, and one more week until Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom offers anything resembling a competing giant blockbuster event. In other words, Solo could still save some box-office face. $100 million may a relatively disappointing bow for any entry in this revived series, but there are worse head starts than one that puts you over the nine-digit line in just four days."}

The CEO of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) and its $221 billion in assets under management once had nothing more than $10,000 in seed capital a little over six decades ago. However, Buffett's steady approach of identifying undervalued business models with strong moats and hanging onto them over the long run has worked out well. Today, the Oracle of Omaha has a net worth of close to $81 billion. Not too shabby!\nBut even the greatest investors come under scrutiny from time to time, and that includes Warren Buffett.\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett speaking with reporters during the annual company shareholder meeting. Image source: The Motley Fool via Flickr.\nIn recent weeks, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have taken heat for a 252.5 million share position in the king of innovation, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nEarlier this month, Apple lowered its holiday quarter sales guidance to $84 billion from a previous forecast of $89 billion to $93 billion, and well below the Wall Street consensus of $91.5 billion. The company cited a significant slowdown in China iPhone sales as the primary reason why revenue would miss the mark. Said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a letter to shareholders, \"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China.\" A combination of higher iPhone price points that were too much for consumers, and the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, really did a number on Apple in the fourth quarter.\nFollowing its warning, Apple shares dipped to as low as $142, which was more than $91 per share off the company's all-time high. With nearly 252.5 million shares owned, this worked out to a paper loss of $23 billion at its peak for Buffett's company. Following a slight bounce, the decline stands at $21 billion through Jan. 8.\nMore so, it has investors worried that Buffett, who has historically avoided the technology sector, could be looking at IBM (NYSE:IBM) version 2.0. After building a hefty position in IBM with the belief that growth in its cloud division would lead to a higher share price, Buffett eventually conceded after years that investing in IBM was a mistake. IBM's legacy operations and late entrance into the cloud continue to hamper its performance to this day, and Buffett's decision to invest in the company wound up costing Berkshire Hathaway a pretty penny by the time it disposed of its stake.\nBut is that really the case with Apple? Probably not, for a variety of reasons.\nTo begin with, Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett have been building a position in Apple over time. It's not as if Buffett simply came along and bought 252.5 million shares of Apple all at once and that was that.

Only when the VIX begins to fall, he said, will the fear actually be baked into stock prices.

This drop in consumption is alarming since people aren't getting the neccessary yearly amount of dairy products according to the Ministry of Health. The recommended yearly consumption of milk and dairy products per person is 220 kilograms but in 1997 it is expected to be just 161.2 kilograms per person (see chart 2).\nIf people do not start consuming more milk and dairy products there could be a serious health problem in the future. \"A long-term low consumption of milk and dairy products will cause serious nourishment problems in our people's heath,\" said Peter Za\u0161ka, secretary of the Slovak Association of Dairy Producers.\nThe reason people aren't getting enough milk is because they can't afford it. Before 1989 the price for a liter of milk was 2 Sk, thanks to the support of the State which financed the production of milk. The government paid 6 to 8 Sk to the producer, so that citizens could buy milk for a very small price. Changes in 1989 and the realization that the state had no money ended this support, causing citizens to see prices of milk and dairy products jump 300 percent.\n\"A liter of milk was the same price as a liter of beer in 1991 (now it's half),\" said J\u00e1n Kres\u00e1k, assistant general director at the Liptovsk\u00e1 mliek\u00e1re\u0148 (a dairy producer in Liptovsky Mikul\u00e1\u0148). \"A kilogram of cheese was the same price as a kilogram of meat. That is common in Western Europe, but our citizens were not able to afford these products.\"\nBecause of low consumption and no more government subsidies, some producers decreased the number of cows, causing an even greater decline in production. The Slovak milk industry is dominated by regional milk processing plants set up around populated centers like Bratislava, Ko\u0161ice, and Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. They were not affected that much by the drop compared to smaller regional producers.\nSome of these smaller milk producers have to make less milk during winter because they cannot sustain feeding cows properly for optimum milk weaning. \"In Liptovsky Mikul\u00e1\u0161,\" explained Kres\u00e1k, \"our summer production is 2.4 times higher than in winter. In winter we have to bring milk from western Slovakia, and that causes prices to go higher.\"\nAnother reason for higher prices is the way milk is packaged now. Milk used to be packaged in old, often smelly plastic bags, which were not very hygienic, but cheap. \"It is becoming unacceptable to sell milk in plastic bags,\" said Kres\u00e1k. \"Milk has to be packaged in paper boxes now. One box though, costs 3 Sk.\" Calculating the price for production, packaging, and the cut that distributors and shops get, and the price of one liter of milk leaps up to 15 - 20 Sk. These prices are not easy for people to swallow.\nDue to the low consumption in the country, producers are looking for new markets, and new ways to attract customers. Slovak milk, and dairy have found that Europe does not need new sources of milk having enough of its own resources. \"It is very hard, almost impossible to export"}

The Virginia-based, decade-old provider of mobile satellite network was acquired last year by Harbinger Capital Partners, an NYC-based hedge fund. Harbinger's idea was to use LightSquared's satellite frequencies to operate a much more lucrative, wholesale cell phone network that it claims would translate to $120 billion in savings to consumers. While LightSquared owns its own spectrum, it needed FCC approval to use it for a different purpose.\nIn January, the FCC said LightSquared could deploy the terrestrial network as long as it didn't interfere with nearby GPS frequencies. The FCC cobbled together the TWG, and in March an offshoot of members from the TWG and GPS industries, the Coalition to Save Our GPS, formed in opposition of LightSquared's proposal.\nIn Thursday's revised proposal, LightSquared outlined a three-prong plan that essentially shifted the network to a new block of spectrum, one it said was far enough from GPS frequencies so that it would reduce interference for 99.5 percent of GPS devices. It claimed (the other 0.5 oercent covers precision agriculture and mining.\nAs expected, members of the Coalition to Save Our GPS said the revised proposal would lead to a \"complete loss of GPS function\" and should be quashed.\nImmediately after submission, members of the Coaltion to Save Our GPS held a press conference to iterate their argument.\n\"This is probably hyperbole, but it would've been an unmitigated disaster of almost biblical proportions,\" said Jim Kirkland, vice president and general counsel of GPS equipment vendor Trimble. \"It doesn't get much more serious than when ambulances, police and fire department vehicles miss critically important information or lose precious time in reaching the scene of an accident or crime because of interference with GPS signals.\"\nKirkland also sounded skeptical of LightSquared's new proposal because the first one failed countless tests conducted by government agencies and industry bodies. \"LightSquared thought that idea was going to work...this raises serious issues as to LightSquared's credibility and technical acumen,\" he said.\nFurthermore, Kirkland pointed out that the revised plan relied on the use of reception filters that had not yet been invented.\nMeanwhile Martin Harriman, LightSquared's executive vice president of Ecosystem Development and Satellite Business, accused the coalition of not taking LightSquared's proposal seriously enough during the last few months.\n\"We've spent over $100 million on months of research, and to have them come back so flippantly is really disappointing,\" he said.\nOther sources involved say there was little cooperation within the committee members, such as test results being turned in at the last minute (leading"}

But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that survive today showed off home cooks' ingenuity.\nSome desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still enjoy niche popularity today.\nImagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You'd like to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, like cherries or pecans, are too expensive or not available.\nDesperate times call for desperation pies (or starvation recipes, if you happen to be in Greece).\nAlso known as \"make-do\" pies, desperation pies were made with any ingredients a farm cook had on hand or could scrounge up at a moment's notice. \"[Desperation pie is] a pie that you made when you had nothing left to make it with,\" says food folklorist and author Joanne Raetz Stuttgen.\nAnd sometimes this meant pulling off feats of tastebud trickery that modern day chefs are rediscovering with great interest, Stuttgen tells The Salt.\nFor example, vinegar pie was the creative cook's fruit-free answer to lemon meringue pie. \"If you want a lemon meringue pie but you have no lemons, the vinegar gets the tartness like the lemon,\" says Stuttgen. Now vinegar pie is so hip, even Chef Emeril Lagasse has a version.\nSome desperation pies of yesteryear were even inspired by off-season cravings. If you wanted an apple pie, and you had a surplus of green tomatoes before the apples were ripe, tossing sliced green tomatoes to sugar and apple pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg was a good substitute, Stuttgen says.\n\"Also, it could be something local,\" she says, \"Like if there was a blight, for instance, that destroyed pecans, you could put in oatmeal in place of the nuts. That can 'mock' the flavor and the appearance of the pecan pie.\"\nWar-time rationing also encouraged a great deal of culinary creativity. Recipes for meatless mincemeat pie, a pie usually made with chopped beef, fruits, and spices, began to emerge in patriotic World War II cookbooks with titles like Cooking Without Meat: A Supplementary Kitchen Guide for War-Time Cookery.\nAdditionally, desperation pie recipes have been shared in community cookbooks for over a century, and many traveled from region to region through these cookbooks, says Stuttgen. Today, thousands of home cooks still share their time-tested pie recipes in popular cookbooks compiled by organizations like the Junior League of Hampton Roads and the Junior League of Seattle.\nEven in times of plenty, some desperation pies, like sugar cream pie in Indiana and chess pie in the South, went on to become famous regional favorites that people still make today. \"They have a place,\" says Stuttgen, \"and they become traditional and symbolic of a region, or a family, where that pie has to be at Christmas every year.\"\nBut Stuttgen says that more than regional character, these pies show the ingenuity and creativity of the American spirit in times of struggle.\n\"These types of pies come from sheer practicality,\" she says, \"You probably cannot convincingly trace them to a specific region or a specific cultural group; instead you just have these women"}

It doesn't get any worse. Infighting is the last sign of a shattered team.\nWhen the Giants decide on a new GM, and it will likely be Dave Gettleman, and he has a hand in picking a new coach, one of the first issues on their agenda will be what to do about Apple. He is just 22 years old, was a first-round pick only a year ago and plays a premium position and he has elite skills.\nBut he has maturity issues. He's been a knucklehead. Now he has teammate issues.\n\"There's one corner that has to establish and needs to grow, and we all know who that is,\" Collins said. \"That would be the only person I would change out of our secondary group. The other two guys \u2014 DRC and Jackrabbit \u2014 I love those two guys. They play hard. They love what they do. But, that first pick, he's a cancer.\"\nThat first pick is Apple.\nCollins could have just called him a bad apple.\nHe called him a cancer.\nNow that Apple has been called out as a \"cancer,\" it's going to be very difficult for him to walk back into the locker room, not only today, when the Giants begin preparations for Washington, but going forward as well.\nAlthough just in his third season, Collins has emerged as one of the strongest voices on the team. He is also respected throughout the locker room. Although he did not have nearly the type of impactful season he had in 2016, when he was first-team All Pro and a contender for defensive player on the year, he is so well thought of around the league that he was named to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.\nThe secondary had been a soap opera this year.\nFirst it was Dominique-Rodgers Cromartie getting suspended one game. Then Jackrabbit Jenkins was suspended one game. Then Apple's mother had brain surgery, and then he was made inactive four straight games (it seemed like an unannounced suspension), played 60 snaps on defense against the Eagles one week ago and then only on special teams against the Cardinals on Sunday.\nIn the middle of all this, Eli Manning was benched for one game and the next day Ben McAdoo and GM Jerry Reese were fired.\nIt's unusual but not unprecedented for a player to call a teammate a cancer in the locker room. But it's rare that they attach their name to it. Collins is so fed up with Apple that he obviously didn't care about any repercussions. He probably had all he could take when he recently said he's been trying to help Apple through his rough times and Apple denied it.\n\"He's got lot of personal things that's going on in his life"}

And so far, European allies aren\u2019t doing a thing to stop him.\nProtests throughout Iran are cresting right as a crisis point for the landmark nuclear deal approaches.\nStarting on January 13, a week from Saturday, Trump will face a deadline over reimposing economic sanctions that the U.S. agreed to lift under the 2015 nuclear deal. Despite the agreement, those sanctions have remained in place, technically; it\u2019s just that president Obama and, thus far, Trump, periodically agree not to enforce them, keeping the deal alive.\nIn other words, as unrest in Iran spreads, Trump has an imminent opportunity to kill the Iran nuclear deal he despises, all by doing nothing.\nAnd as of right now, there\u2019s no wave of concerted allied diplomacy aimed at keeping him in, The Daily Beast has learned.\nThat\u2019s in marked contrast to the last time Trump brought the U.S. to the precipice of withdrawing from the Iran deal was October, when he \u201cdecertified\u201d Iranian compliance with the deal, even though the International Atomic Agency has consistently found Iran to live up to its obligations under what\u2019s formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Before he did, the White House and the State Department endured a full-court press from the U.S.\u2019 traditional European allies to save the deal.\nBut the Europeans are relatively silent this time. \u201cWe\u2019re not pressing the White House, which is aware of our position,\u201d a senior European diplomat told The Daily Beast.\nAnother European diplomat from a different country confirmed the lack of a concerted pressure campaign, saying the Trump administration and Congress knows full well the Europeans want the agreement to remain intact. This second diplomat said they remain \u201cconcerned by the possible implications\u201d of Washington reneging on the nuclear deal.\nAs Politico observed, if Trump declines to waive sanctions, the implications for the deal\u2019s future are far greater than any decertification. (After all, the whole American \u201ccertification\u201d concept was a product of U.S. legislation, not the deal itself.)

National security adviser H.R. McMaster told legislators last fall that Trump could let the deal remain in place, \u2014if Congress would get rid of the politically troublesome requirement of recertifying Iran\u2019s compliance over and over again. If it didn\u2019t, McMaster suggested, Trump might not waive the sanctions when they come due in January.

The civil war had just ended and a small force of confederate guerilla fighters had been persuaded to turn themselves in to federal forces for amnesty.\nThey arrive at the federal encampment, to be disarmed and then told to assemble in the middle of the camp. There they are instructed to raise their right hands and repeat the oath to the union, as read by a union officer.\nBut the script takes a horrible turn as the union officer starts to insult the men, expecting them to repeat his insults; the men grumble that this isn\u2019t what they bargained for.\nThe assembled men, who expected to hear unification and a welcome back into the fold; instead are bushwhacked and massacred.\nIf the past is any predictor of the future, President Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech set for tomorrow, will have shades of the repatriation scene (figuratively) in Josey Wales.\nDemocrat operatives have said the intent of the president is to destroy the Republicans, so his party can gain control of both houses of the legislature.\nThe Republicans have been bushwhacked and massacred on many occasions during sessions like the State of the Union speech by this president; will they again just sit there and take it?\nIn the past, President Obama has insulted Republicans in Congress, forcing one congressman to blurt out \u201cyou lie,\u201d during the presidents speech.\nEven the Supreme Court has been targeted. In an unprecedented breach of propriety, he berated the justices sitting below him for their decision to give free speech rights to American Corporations in political campaigns.\nAfter Obama slammed them for their decision, Justice Alito shook his head and appeared to say \u201cnot true,\" as Democrats stood and applauded all around the Supreme Court members.\nPresident Obama has shown by his actions in the past he won\u2019t hesitate to use his bully pulpit, to be a bully.\nWill the Republicans push back?\nPerhaps tomorrow will mark the beginning of a new strategy to fire back at the president. Obamas speech will be followed by a rebuttal from Republican rising star, Marco Rubio.\nRubio is well spoken and well respected; he knows how to deliver a powerful speech.

It\u2019s important to state right up front that there is no shame in being targeted and rarely shame in being compromised. The exception in compromise is when departments are lax or incompetent, which emphasizes the need for advanced detection, incident response and smart automation.\nNevertheless, as Willie Sutton was famously misquoted saying when asked why banks are robbed \u201c\u2026because that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d in a very real way, being targeted is a consequence of success. What matters most is how we comport ourselves and act during a breach and after. In the end, companies can be villains or heroes; but they do not have the luxury or ability to wallow in being the victims of attack.\nVery few infrastructure breaches start out the way this appears to have done. Next, it appears that they leaned in and worked on this the right way. They have reported no lost data in spite of infrastructure compromise, which is always good; but the message here is understanding risk, implications, constituents and acting transparently and responsibly. Inferring from the outside and from personal experience, chaos must have intruded but been tamed with communications, management and good-old-fashioned leadership. I wasn't there, but I can imagine there are some unsung heroes and heroines behind the scenese.\nThe one thing that I ask is to share learnings. Whether at Visma or elsewhere, share the stories and laud the advances. Going forward, others should look here and ask the people on the inside for lessons learned. These sorts of successes should be highlighted and learned from within Visma, but also in the wider industry. While most cyber conflict will pillory the losers, when we have heroes who have won or survived with dignity, we should not ignore it and should slow down to acknowledge it and look deeper.

You travel between worlds using magical pipes, crushing enemies and gathering coins along the way.\nSound like a typical Super Mario Bros. game? Not so fast. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle \u2014 yes, that\u2019s really the new Ubisoft-meets-Nintendo mashup game\u2019s name \u2014 is as strange as it is fascinating. It retains Mushroom Kingdom staples like the red coin challenge, sure. And yes, you\u2019ll be rewarded with secret items for exploring hard-to-reach places.\nBut this Ubisoft-developed oddity, which launches August 29 exclusive to Nintendo\u2019s hybrid TV-mobile Switch game console, is a crossover experiment that mixes the mustachioed plumber\u2019s universe with that of Ubisoft\u2019s Rabbids \u2014 those zany, mischievous critters from designer Michel Ancel\u2018s trippy Rayman games. (They also star in a loopy spinoff series.) And unlike the Mario franchise\u2019s signature platform-hopping capers, Mario + Rabbids is a strategic roleplaying game that requires players masterfully maneuver their way through colorful chess-like levels, smiting enemies to reach their goal. It\u2019s a bizarre, delightful and surprisingly difficult take on a Mario game.\nAt its core, Mario + Rabbids involves turn-based battles of a piece with archetypal games like X-COM: UFO Defense and Jagged Alliance. After entering a clearly marked battle area, you\u2019ll be able to examine the battlefield from a bird\u2019s-eye view to strategize. In this mode, you can also hover over enemies to get more information about them, such as how much health they have. During your turn, you\u2019ll have the option to move your character, launch an attack, and as the game progresses, perform a special move.\nYour party can consist of a mix of classic Mario characters working alongside Rabbids cosplaying familiar faces: there\u2019s a Rabbids Mario, for instance, as well as a Rabbids Peach. Mario is always the team leader, and at least one Rabbid must be part of your group. As in other roleplaying games that break personas into distinctive abilities, each character offers unique strengths, perks and special moves.\nWhere and how you choose to move each character influences variables like the effectiveness of your strike and how well you\u2019re able to defend yourself. If an enemy is partially hidden behind cover, for example, you\u2019ll need to move to a spot with an open view in order to successfully attack them. Likewise, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re adequately covered at all times as you switch locations on the map.\nTo broaden your options, Ubisoft gives you special skills that expand each\u2019s stages route possibilities. From the start, you\u2019ll be able to extend a character\u2019s movement range by rebounding off another party member\u2019s head. You can also tag foes as you\u2019re running with a technique called \u201cdash,\u201d dishing out damage out as you scurry for your new spot. Mastering when to use these leaps and offensive hits is how you\u2019ll win a battle.\nYou\u2019ll also have the chance to upgrade these abilities and add new ones as the game progresses. (Using orbs as digital currency, you can enhance certain powers by extending their effects and reducing their cool-down times.)

{"idx": "11330", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Expert tips for making the most of Amazon's advertising offerings and factors to manage before you even get started.\nBryant Garvin speaking on Amazon advertising at SMX West 2019.\nAmazon can deliver customers at unmatched scale, but it requires significant seller investment compared to running campaigns on Google, Todd Bowman, senior director of Amazon and eRetail at Merkle, told the audience at SMX West in San Jose, California, last week.\nIn the same session, Bryant Garvin, director of advertising at e-commerce brand partner Pattern, discussed many of these factors while stressing that sellers with adequate resources and capabilities shouldn\u2019t be scared away by the necessary adaptations.\nOne of the biggest differences between Amazon and Google, said Garvin, is the relationship between organic and ad optimization. The Amazon algorithm is designed to reward sales: with more sales comes more visibility. For starters, that means Amazon advertisers need to pay close attention to product detail pages because not only are these often your landing pages, but many of those details get pulled into ads as well.\nPricing, reviews, images, customer feedback, shipping speed, response rates and stocked inventory are all critical factors for Amazon sellers. Additionally, there are features unique to Amazon such as Buy Box (Add to Cart) and Prime shipping eligibility that can determine the viability and success of your ad campaigns.\nBowman laid out four steps to a winning strategy with Amazon ads for sellers on the platform. The first priority, he said, is brand protection with ads targeting brand keywords related to your high-priority products. Next is to focus on new customer acquisition by expanding your keyword targets to non-brand and upper-funnel terms in relevant categories and interest areas. The third step is to market up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. And finally, conquest market share by targeting competitor keywords and products.\nGarvin mapped out a similar strategic approach aimed at setting up ad campaigns based on goals dubbed CABN \u2014 for conquest, automatic, branded and non-branded targeting.

Many are the work of cartoonists working at the Media Center for the 17th of February Revolution.\nIn the late afternoon, young men gather to see just how much tire rubber they can burn. Fishtailing Toyotas leave a smear of swirling, smoking, sticky blackness on the pavement. From a hotel room high above, the streaks appear like some kind of postmodern design.\nAbout a mile away, just off Revolution Square, more substantive creations are taking shape. This is the Media Center for the 17th of February Revolution \u2014 a dingy, dog-eared building bustling day and night with frenetic 20- and 30-somethings trying to process what's going on in Libya.\nOn the second floor, a cottage industry of sorts has developed, producing anti-Moammar Gadhafi posters. The walls are plastered with mainly black and white cartoons of the leader.\nIn one, he's a fanged vampire with bombs and machine guns popping out of the top of his head. In another, Gadhafi is depicted as a monkey picking lice off a crony. They all ooze vitriol.\nAkram Muhammed el Biriky, 32, one of a cadre of cartoonists working at the center, says he cranks out four to five drawings a day. This afternoon the caricature he's working on presents the dictator in oversize sunglasses dripping blood from the lower half of his body.\nThe artist, sporting a goatee and jean jacket, says he used to draw his sketches at home in secret and then tear them up for fear of being discovered and imprisoned. When things quiet down, Biriky hopes for a career in fashion or interior design \u2014 occupations, he says, that were stifled under the old regime.\nHovering about in a dark headscarf, Hemy says she tries to make sure that as the artists lampoon Gadhafi, they don't offend any of Libya's tribes.\nHemy studied law but says she found her true calling during the uprising that began in February: demonstrating against the regime and admonishing the men to join her. She urged her husband and 17-year-old son to take up arms, telling them if they die, they die as martyrs \u2014 and if they live, they live as revolutionaries.\nUp one more flight of stairs at the Media Center is the rehearsal space for Guys Underground.

On a night full of working-class Southern rock, the Drive-By Truckers put on a sharp and riveting show that far outshined their openers.\nBred in upstate New York but formed in Brooklyn, The Felice Brothers were so close to being good. The band inhabits the increasingly popular belt between indie and country. It\u2019s a genre that requires technical skill and soulful nostalgia, both of which they convey in their studio recordings. Unfortunately, it was the latter that they lacked in concert. During their twelve-song set, the Brothers seemed exhausted. James Felice\u2019s Dylan-esque vocals and the band\u2019s impressive musicality couldn\u2019t carry their lifeless set. Even the layout of the stage foretold the band\u2019s failings; cramped into a small space in front of DBT\u2019s equipment, the Felice Brothers looked and sounded awkward. The highlights of their set \u2014 a brilliant and hilarious \u201cWhiskey in My Whiskey\u201d and an achingly earnest \u201cTake This Bread\u201d \u2014 were the heartfelt few songs that really captivated the crowd.\nLuckily, the Drive-By Truckers soon followed. In today\u2019s musical world, DBT do not shy away from touring. Frontman Patterson Hood at one point claimed that his down-home brooders have been on tour since 1998. After Wednesday\u2019s superb set of blue-collar love, loss and drinking, you can see why: They\u2019re damn good at it. Opening with \u201cUsed To Be A Cop,\u201d a dark ballad off February\u2019s Go-Go Boots, DBT maintained high levels of energy and vigor without once faltering in technical skill.\nFor the rest of their two-hour set, the band jumped from album to album, performing older songs with just as much enthusiasm as they demonstrated during their newer songs. In fact, some of their best tracks were from older albums, including their rowdy interpretation of AC/DC\u2019s \u201cLet There Be Rock\u201d and \u201cHell No, I Ain\u2019t Happy,\u201d a powerful, bluesy tune from their 2003 album Decoration Day. Whether the Truckers were furiously raging or tenderly mourning in their bleaker songs, they are always a band whose success rests in tales of proletarian strife. Even after thirteen years of near-constant touring, Hood can still confess, \u201cone night when I was seventeen, I drank a fifth of vodka on an empty stomach\u201d without the lyrics sounding the slightest bit tired.\nAfter forming in Athens, Georgia in 1996, the Drive-By Truckers became one of the first bands to use the Internet as a promotional tool. This, and their near-constant touring, is what first helped them attract a base of dedicated fans. However, it was not until the 2001 release of double album Southern Rock Opera \u2014 a concept album that intertwines the story of a fictional band with the history of Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2014 that DBT achieved commercial success. Since then, the Truckers have been remarkably productive, putting out six studio albums in the past eight years. Their most recent release, Go-Go Boots, was yet another solid collection of beer-slamming country-rock anthems.\nAnd they don\u2019t seem to keen on stopping. After a fulfilling, sixteen-s"}

The paper says the procedure is pure diplomatic politeness. Russia\u2019s partners know well that the appointment of representatives is the sovereign right of every nation.

Your computer, smart phone, TV, tablet and even your home appliances like fridges and security camera systems are increasingly using data and requiring high-speed internet connectivity. FTTH is becoming an essential utility, much like water and electricity,\u201d says Linda.\n\u201cOf course, the proviso to all of this working flawlessly comes with one really important caveat \u2013choosing the right internet service provider (ISP) before you sign. While it\u2019s true that the steps to getting fibre to your home are not always plain sailing, as there are many role players and steps involved, knowing what to expect, who is involved in the process, and what the important things are to look out for will streamline the process considerably,\u201d explains Linda.\nOnce your suburb is approved for fibre and the necessary wayleaves have been granted by the local council, the infrastructure provider commences building the backbone network \u2013 this is typically a fibre ring which feeds the fibre from a centrally placed distribution node to every block in the suburb.\nThis is where the trenching of pavements and driveways begins \u2013 and many residents tend to lose their sense of humour, albeit temporarily. Infrastructure providers do go to great lengths to restore the area to its original state and within a few weeks of completion, your pavement and driveway should be back to normal.\nEach street in the suburb is then linked up to the backbone network and gets \u2018fibred\u2019. As each customer signs up for service, the fibre is then taken from the distribution box on the street boundary wall to a point inside your home, typically following the shortest route possible.\nFinally, your chosen Internet Service Provider (ISP) who provides your internet connectivity and bills you every month for the service, will install a Wi-Fi router in your home and get you connected to the internet.\nEquipment: Does the ISP package include the cost of a Wi-Fi router and installation or is this an additional once off cost?

It represents a substantial escalation of the US military campaign in the region, and could be interpreted by the Syrian government as an act of war.\nSix people were killed in the airstrike, according to a televised statement by the Syrian\u2019s Armed Forces General Command.\n\u201cOur men and women in uniform carried out this military strike with precision and skill, and I applaud their courage and bravery. It was appropriate to hold Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad accountable for his cruel and illegal use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians, including women and children. The Assad regime clearly violated the 2013 Russian-led agreement at the United Nations requiring Syria to turn over all its chemical weapons.\n\u201cLast night\u2019s missile strike appears to be a proportional response for Assad\u2019s brutal killing of innocent civilians, but there are still unanswered questions, including how the strike will impact American forces on the ground fighting ISIS and what this means for long-term military engagement in Syria. President Trump needs to come up with a strategy to resolve the Syrian conflict, share his plans with the American people and win their support before taking further action.\n\u201cThe use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime is the latest in a desperate and violent war that Assad is waging on his own people. Neither Congress nor the American people know the full extent of how this Trump Administration action was planned and executed. We do know the Assad regime in Syria consistently commits horrendous atrocities against its own people, but the U.S. bombing of a Syrian airbase unilaterally, undertaken outside a global coalition to remove the Assad regime, is a high-risk action that could cause terrorist retaliation against U.S. targets anywhere in the world.\nFormer Congressman Dennis Kucinich traveled to Syria on a fact finding trip in January and met with President Bashar al-Assad. Kucinich also conducted a 2013 interview with Assad in which the Syrian leader promised to destroy his chemical weapons, as agreed to under a deal brokered by Russia.\nKucinich called the U.S. airstrike an overreach of presidential power and illegal under international law.\n\u201cWe have to be very careful about this interventionism because it\u2019s wrong; it\u2019s illegal and it could get us into a wider war,\u201d Kucinich said Friday from London, where he said he appeared at a parliamentary briefing on Syria and a conference about Syria.\nHe said it was still unclear who carried out the gas attack, which the Trump administration has blamed on the Syrian regime."}

'A father should know everything about his children,' he says. No wonder Tabitha was so reluctant to send her to pre-school. 'It's like an episode of Bewitched and I'm Darren,' he smiles. She explains all of the magic and mayhem that she's been behind over the years. She also tells him that she made Timmy from a doll and, with some prompting from her daughter, tells him that she's had her current body since the Seventeenth Century. With difficulty, she then recounts Timmy's death. It was one of the hardest things that she and Julian ever had to face. He changed both of their lives. As she cries, he takes her hand. Endora is happy to see this and conjures up some martimmis for her parents. Julian remembers that last time they had one of these: It was the night they conceived Endora.

These groups, though their views and actions are accepted by law and by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms are being denied access to a government benefit solely because of their religious beliefs or conscientious objection,\u201d said Cardinal Collins.\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops originally raised objections to changes in the federal funding requirements for the Canada Summer Jobs program in a Jan. 11 statement.\nIn response, the Canadian government issued \u201csupplementary information\u201d Jan. 23 about what situations would warrant a denial of funds. This clarification of the new policy emphasizes a distinction between the activities and the beliefs of an organization when the government determines who will receive funding.\nThe statement also includes five example of how eligibility is determined, with a hypothetical \u201cfaith-based organization with anti-abortion beliefs\u201d among its examples.\n\u201cExample 1: An organization whose primary activities are focused on removing, or actively undermining existing women\u2019s reproductive rights, applies for funding. This organization would not be eligible to apply,\u201d begins the list.\nThe next example differentiates a situation in which \u201ca faith-based organization with anti-abortion beliefs applies for funding to hire students to serve meals to the homeless. The organization provides numerous programs in support of their community. The students would be responsible for meal planning, buying groceries, serving meals, etc. This organization would be eligible to apply,\u201d according to the Employment and Social Development department of Canada.\nHowever, a summer camp that \u201cdoes not welcome LGBTQ2 young people\u201d would not be eligible to apply for funding to hire students as camp counselors, while \u201ca faith-based organization that embraces a traditional definition of marriage\u201d could hire students for the primary purpose of assisting the elderly \u201cregardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,\u201d according to other examples.\nThe examples thus hinge on whether the core mandate, which is defined as the \u201cthe primary activities undertaken by the organization,\u201d respect the \u201cestablished individual human"}
{"idx": "11355", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: GARY GUTTING: In your recent book, you talk a lot about the rights of people to immigrate or to remain in a country after they\u2019ve immigrated. What would you say to those who think that immigration policy should instead focus on the right of a country to decide who gets to live there? They might agree that there are extreme situations \u2014 say the threat of genocide \u2014 in which people have a right to immigrate, but generally, they\u2019d say, the citizens of a country have a right to decide who they want to take into their community. How do you respond to that position?\nJOSEPH CARENS: I think this way of posing the question confuses two issues. The first is the question of who ought to have the authority to decide what a policy will be. The second is whether that policy is morally acceptable. Someone can have the right to make a decision and can still make a decision that is morally wrong. Let\u2019s assume for the moment that the citizens of a country have a moral and legal right to determine who they will take into their country. It doesn\u2019t follow that whatever they decide is morally defensible. Even apart from the question of people fleeing genocide, I think everyone today would agree that it would be morally wrong to exclude people on the basis of race or religion.\nSo, we have to ask what other moral limitations there are on what democratic states ought to do in the area of immigration. Most of my book is concerned with identifying those limitations, even if one accepts the general premise that democratic states should be able to control immigration.\nWe should create a firewall between immigration enforcement and those responsible for protecting basic human rights.\nG.G.: I know you want to question that premise, since you defend an \u201copen-borders\u201d position on immigration. We\u2019ll come back to that, but, first, could you say a bit more about the moral limitations on other aspects of our control of immigration?\nJ.C.: Yes. Quite apart from the admissions question, we can ask how states should treat those immigrants who are already present. For example, we ought to discuss the terms under which immigrants and their children should gain access to citizenship, what legal rights immigrants should have and so on. I also view the debate about irregular migration \u2014 what many people call the question of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d \u2014 as less about admissions than about whether migrants who have settled without permission have any moral claims to legal rights and legal status.\nG.G.: What sort of moral claims do you have in mind?\nJ.C.: I have two kinds in mind: first, moral claims to legal rights even while immigrants are still in an irregular status and, second, moral claims to legal status as residents and, eventually, to citizenship itself.\nSome people would say that \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d should have no legal rights at all, precisely because their very presence is \u201cillegal.\u201d But no one really would defend that view if they thought about it for a moment. The fact that immigrants have settled without authorization does not mean that it\u2019s O.K. to kill them or beat them up or rob them. Even \u201cillegals\u201d are entitled to protection of their basic human rights, and most people acknowledge this in principle.\nThe problem is that some (in Arizona, for example) want to link immigration enforcement to everything else, so that those whose job it is to protect basic human rights, like local police or workers in emergency rooms, are expected to report anyone with an irregular immigration status. The result is that irregular migrants will steer clear of the authorities, and so will be vulnerable to extreme abuse. If we take human rights seriously, we should take the opposite approach.

These bugs don\u2019t bite, but their tiny hairs can trigger an allergic reaction, providing yet another reason to hate the invasive critters, which are just starting to munch on tree leaves and pepper backyard decks with droppings.\nGypsy moth rashes were first documented in the early 1980s, during the last major infestation in the Northeast. About 10 percent of the people who lived in high-infestation areas were affected by the rash, which does no harm and disappears without leaving any scars.\n\u201cNo treatment is necessary unless people are uncomfortable from the itch,\u201d said Dr. Daniela Kroshinsky, director of inpatient and pediatric dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Most people can ease the itch with over-the-counter antiitch creams or an antihistamine, she said.\nBut Morey, a 43-year-old bartender and mother of three, is so sensitive and suffered so severely that her doctor prescribed a steroid to quiet her body\u2019s overreaction.\nPlymouth resident Tammy Morey received a rash on her arm from gypsy moth caterpillars.\n\u201cPeople laugh at me because I make such a big deal, but they have no idea what it\u2019s like,\u201d Morey said.

Gypsy moths are suspected because the rashes are showing up when the caterpillars are plentiful. Other caterpillars could be responsible, but the rashes are appearing just as gypsy moths have hatched and begun crawling.\nYoung saw several cases last year, and this year \u201cit\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d he said.\nPeople can be exposed even if the caterpillar doesn\u2019t come into contact with their skin, Young said.

This essay explores one of the less apparent, but powerful, factors that forms an important component of many Russians\u2019 view of the world and life. It is a factor that has become deeply imbedded in the Russian character, particularly during the last century.\nHistory teaches Russians that the power of fate to destroy is such that few institutions are strong enough to last \u2014 be they governments, banks or corporations. For most Russians, the foundation of stability in life is provided not through savings or life insurance, but through owning one\u2019s own apartment. Receiving an apartment was the ultimate achievement during Soviet times, and it remains the primary goal of most young families today. This priority will be familiar to people of other cultures.\nThe difference arises when it comes to saving for, buying and choosing the location of the apartment and reliability of their employers.\nPerhaps Russians value personal relationships so much because they put little trust in institutions and believe that fate is a capricious force that preys on us all. If it is difficult for an employer to convince most of the staff that the company\u2019s mission is great and holy, although there is a distinct strain of believers that will enthusiastically embrace corporate infallibility, it is quite realistic to grow a strong sense of community and family at work.\nThe team, or kollektiv, can be an amazingly strong binding force that drives incredible commitment and sacrifice. There can exist an extremely strong sense that we are in this together, that we must stick together to overcome the threat of some outside force, be it competitors, the tax authorities, market forces or corporate headquarters. The veteran Russian kollektiv will display the same sense of camaraderie found among soldiers who have survived a campaign together.\nEqually, it can also present an unassailable wall for the expat manager who is viewed as an outsider. Corporations and leaders seeking to develop and change a local Russian business, particularly one that has successfully navigated the dynamic growth and crises of the last 20 years, must recognize the challenge and opportunity that a strong kollektiv represents. All successful organizations exhibit a natural resistance to change. But here such resistance is often underpinned by the deeply ingrained Russian yearning for stability and fear of change \u2014 that hand of fate that may once again come and sweep away everything one has built.\nFifteen years after moving to Russia, I find myself in a strangely contradictory position. I spend most of my time working in Russian with a largely Russian kollektiv in which we have grown up and experienced a lot of success together. At home I am absorbed in a loving Russian-American extended family. As the head of our kollektiv \u2014 which is now the Russian branch of a major international corporation \u2014 I am challenged to lead change and growth without becoming the destructive hand of fate in the eyes of our kollektiv. I seek to retain my credibility at headquarters as the right leader who understands where we must go and has the will to take us there, while retaining the trust of my colleagues that I will not betray them for the sake of career.\nFive years into the role, we seem to have made some progress along the right path. Frankly, the global economic crisis that hit Russia hard has been a help. It presented an undeniable need to change to a group that had unavoidably become somewhat spoiled by success.

I suppose what I mean is, I was acutely aware that I was surrounded on all sides, exits blocked, walls of yammering humanity looming like mountains. That kind of everywhere.\nI desperately wished that they'd all just disappear. I was about to make a fool of myself in public, you see, and that's a far less bitter pill to swallow when the \"public\" in question consists of maybe a couple crickets and a tumbleweed.\nSoundSelf is a game about meditation wherein you, well, meditate. That involves two very specific things: 1) wearing an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and 2) making loud-ish droning sounds of various pitches for about half an hour. Like, with your mouth. Soundself is essentially a psychedelic visualizer that reacts to human voice. Pitch and tone slowly but surely open new paths and \"areas,\" for lack of a better term.\nIt's something of an odd sight to witness. As someone who is prone to bouts of violent self-consciousness that result in profuse sweating and a total inability to focus, I could already feel my hands going all clammy and gross. I'd knowingly brought this upon myself, however, so there was no turning back.\nCreator Robin Arnott greeted me with a hug and a headset, and that was it: I was off. Before me I saw near-infinite blackness punctuated by a small, lightly colored circle peering back at me from a distance. It was like a tiny cyclopian eye studying me with piercing curiosity, waiting to see what I'd do.\nI hummed. A low hum at first, but I gradually constricted my throat, leading to a higher and higher pitch. The circle shook, reverberated, like a Jello mold in a relatively light earthquake. Then it pulsated and grew, slowly consuming the darkness.\nI spent my first ten-or-so minutes only paying cursory attention to the spectacle, infinitely more concerned by the fact that I was going \"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" really loudly while a bunch of conference show-goers probably watched on in horrified amusement, bemusement, and possibly even c-musement, whatever that is. Yes, I was wearing an Oculus Rift and headphones so I couldn't see or hear anyone, but I was certain I'd attracted an audience - and not for good reasons.\n\"You look like a crazy person,\" said the more self-deprecating portions of my brain. \"Everyone notices you.\" I wished I was a turtle or, like, a really big snail.

There's this tapestry of sound ebbing and flowing at all times, procedurally moving to fill in the gaps left by your tones and pitches. If I hummed or growled deeply, distorted cellos echoed all around me, occasionally swelling in a way that made it feel as though they were emerging from my own chest.

Gen. Michael Dana, the Marine Corps' deputy commandant for Installations and Logistics (I&L). And the process has already begun to make it a reality.\nIn the fall of 2016, Marines at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri equipped about 20 military vehicles, including Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements, known as MTVRs or 7-tons, and massive tractor-trailers known as Logistics Vehicle System Replacements, or LVSRs, with engine sensors designed to anticipate and identify key parts failures.\nIt's a commercially available technology that some civilian vehicles already use, but it's a new capability for Marine Corps trucks. Testing on those sensors will wrap-up this summer, and officials with I&L will assess how accurately and thoroughly the sensors captured and transmitted maintenance data.\nIf all goes well, the Marines then will work to connect the sensors with an automatic system that can order parts that will then be 3D printed on demand and delivered to the vehicle's unit.\n\"How do we use that data and how do we link that back to our fabrication or supply network to make the system operate in theory without a person in the loop, so make sure we're doing push logistics [versus] pull logistics,\" said Lt. Col. Howard Marotto, a senior member of the Marine Corps' logistics innovation team and the service's additive manufacturing lead. \"Now we have the part there waiting when the vehicle gets back in from the convoy, or it's already there a week in advance before we know we need to change it out. So that's the concept and that's what we're going to try to prove with that.\"\nA Marine sniper provides security from the back of an MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (MATV) during a pre-deployment exercise at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California.\nDana, who spoke with Military.com in June, is eager to bypass maintenance supply chains that sometimes have gear traveling thousands of miles to get to a unit downrange, and inefficient logistics systems that create lag while maintainers wait for parts to arrive.\n\"If we had the ability to print a part far forward, which we have that capability, that reduces your order-to-ship time. And you then combine that with what we call sense-and-respond logistics, or smart logistics, which is \u2026 it can tell you with a predictive capability that this part is going to fail in the next 20 hours or the next ten hours,\" Dana said.\nThe goal of having trucks that can do everything but self-install repair parts is in keeping with the Marine Corps' newfound love affair with innovative technology. The Corps recently became the first military service to send 3D printers to combat zones with conventional troops, so that maintainers could print everything from 81mm mortar parts to pieces of radios in hours, instead of waiting days or longer for factory-made parts to arrive.\nFor Dana, it's simply time for the Marine Corps to cash in on technologies that industry is already using to advantage.\n\"You look at Tesla, their vehicles literally get automatic upgrades; it's almost like a vehicle computer that's driving"}

And it was like, you know, we'd rather play here locally than have to drive into Savannah.\"\nBecause everyone will be getting acquainted with the game of kickball and with one another, teams will not be picked in a conventional manner for the first few weeks.

The country accounts for over 90 percent of the $5 billion HNB market, according to Euromonitor.\nTobacco makers initially struggled to keep up with strong demand as they began introducing HNB products in limited Japanese markets a few years ago. But they have since ramped up production, with investors now worried about slowing growth.\nJapan Tobacco said it would cut the price of its Ploom TECH device to 3,000 yen ($27.61) from 4,000 yen, timed with the official start of nationwide sales on Monday.\n\u201cWe are finally prepared and confident that we can reverse our position and go on the offensive,\u201d said Chito Sasaki, president of the company\u2019s domestic tobacco business, told Reuters.\nThe company, while a dominant player in Japan\u2019s cigarette market with a 60 percent share, has been lagging rivals in the HNB category. Philip Morris, which was first to start selling HNB products in Japan in 2014, claims iQOS has a 16.8 percent share in Japan\u2019s overall tobacco market, including conventional cigarettes.\nPhilip Morris has said it will cut the price of its tobacco-heating device iQOS by about 30 percent to 7,980 yen from Friday.

The first was not to solicit financial or electoral support on religious grounds. The second was not to give any form of special access to policy-making or campaigning to any faith group. The third was to repudiate immediately and publicly any person or organisation who solicits support for it on any religious basis.\nNone has sent any kind of reply. This may simply reflect the routine discourtesy of large organisations today in dealing with correspondence. Ironically, the only organisation I know with a high standard of replies is the Church of England.\nHowever, there may be a more sinister reason for the silence of the seven lambs. Perhaps none of the leaders have the nerve to give those pledges. Perhaps each one of them is in thrall to organised religion. If so \u2013 then why (for heaven's sake)? There is no evidence that voters want to see more religious influence in British politics \u2013 quite the opposite.\nIn a poll conducted by YouGov and the British Social Attitudes Survey, no fewer than 81% of respondents thought religion was a private matter and should be kept separate from politics (against just six per cent who disagreed), while 71% thought religious leaders should have no influence on government.\nAdmittedly, that poll was taken in 2012. Perhaps there has been a massive religious revival since then. If so, I have missed it and so have the pollsters. Faith schools are the most obvious expression of religious power in British politics. No party dares to challenge them and this government actually created a new and easier pathway for faith groups to set up schools.\nBut faith schools are not popular. In a survey last summer, 58% of respondents wanted to see them lose state funding or be abolished outright. Only 30 per cent had no objections of any kind to state funding for faith schools.\nThis was followed last autumn by a survey in which 60% of respondents described themselves as not religious at all (compared to eight per cent who said that they were very religious). More than half of all respondents thought that religion did more harm than good: fewer than a quarter believed that it was a force for good. Intriguingly, younger respondents (those least likely to vote) were less hostile to religion than those over 55 (those most likely to vote).\nHowever, this generational divide was reversed in the YouGov/Times poll published in February this year, in which 42% of respondents said they had no religion. Nearly half of those aged under-25 described themselves in that way, compared to one in ten of those over-60. However, among all ages of voters, politicians' ratings actually improved slightly if they admitted that they did not believe in God.\nNone of this evidence seems to have influenced either the government or the Labour party. The coalition decided to make faith an organ of government by appointing the first-ever minister for faith, Baroness Warsi. Her official job description included the promotion of faith and she had a budget (tiny but specified) for activities by people of faith. She told the House of Lords in 2013 that her specific role \"is to ensure that the voice of people of faith is heard [in the formulation and implementation of policy], which has not always been the case\".\n"}

ChenOne Builders \u2013 an offshoot of the well-known apparel and home ware brand \u2013 launched COLAH (ChenOne Luxury Apartments & Homes) Properties with the objective of filling this market gap.\nThe development of the first initiative of COLAH Properties began in Faisalabad late last year, featuring fully-serviced luxury apartments on Canal Road. The project is spread across 500,000 square feet, while 125,000 square feet have been designated for amenities to cater to the daily requirements of residents. The apartments are available in 10 sizes, offered on a four-year instalment plan, with a 10% down-payment requirement (see the table below for the pricing structure of COLAH Properties Faisalabad).\nBajwa explains that because horizontal spaces are becoming scarce, this has led to an escalation in property prices across Pakistan and, as a result, the middle-income consumer segment is no longer able to buy property. The other problem is that the properties that are within their budget range are located far from the city centre, and living there entails putting up with extensive travel time and costs. Further adding to the woes of prospective homeowners is the fact that there are very limited smaller living space options.\n\"Horizontal spaces are becoming scarce, which has led to an escalation in property prices across Pakistan and, as a result, the middle-income consumer segment is no longer able to buy property.\"\nOn-site amenities include grocery stores, laundry shops, housekeeping services, salons, flower shops, a bakery, fruit and vegetable markets, ice-cream parlours and a mosque. Added to this, residents will also enjoy free membership of COLAH Club.\n\u201cThe club culture has become very popular in Faisalabad. However, the membership of these clubs is so expensive and exclusive that most people are unable to become members. Now, anyone living in our apartments will automatically be given membership, and can begin using the facilities without paying anything extra.\u201d Recreational options include eateries, a coffee shop, a rooftop restaurant, a cinema screen, a play area for children, a food court, a gym, saunas, Jacuzzis, tennis and squash courts, a swimming pool, a snooker area, an aerobics studio and even a small cricket ground.\nThe greatest attraction of the project is that residents do not have to worry about the law and order situation as almost everything is a few minutes\u2019 walk away, in the safety of a compound. This is primarily why most of the initial bookings have come from the industrial business community. Bajwa believes this is because Faisalabad has a large business community that travels frequently and most of them worry about the security of their families when they are away. This is perhaps why, since the project\u2019s launch, 30% of the apartments have already been sold.\nHowever, despite these issues, ChenOne Builders are keen to expand their projects to other cities because they believe that the market holds great potential, and once the policy issues are settled, the market will recover. As a result, they are planning to launch COLAH Properties in Lahore and Islamabad sometime this year. Both projects are similar to the one in Faisalabad and will feature luxury apartments. The Islamabad project, however, is expected to include 2,50"}

{"idx": "11411", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD, is an anxiety disorder that traps children in cycles of repetitive thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions).\nThese obsessions are not your ordinary worries. They consume your child\u2019s daily schedule and can cause distress.\nCompulsions are rituals children do to get rid of the obsessions. For example, a young child may have thoughts that someone will break into his house and be consumed with rituals of checking the doors, whereas an older child may fear that he will be contaminated with germs and constantly wash his hands.\nOCD may vary with age and usually has a genetic component to it. If parents have OCD, they are more likely to pass it on to their child. Also, stress can worsen the symptoms of OCD. The more stressed children are with school or if a traumatic event happened, the more likely their obsessions will increase.\nI once had a child (age 10) who had the obsessive thought that something bad would happen to himself and his family. He feared and kept obsessing that someone would break into his house and kidnap him and kill his family while they were sleeping.\nThe child lived on the second floor and his parents had a home security system in place. The child would have the compulsion to constantly check the door and windows to make sure they were locked and lost many hours of sleep obsessing that someone would find a way to break into his house.\n1. Explain what OCD is: It is important to explain to the child what OCD is and how it grows. You can tell the child that OCD is anxiety or worry that grows just like any fruit or vegetable. They grow because you pay attention to the fruit or vegetable. You plant a seed, you water it and a green shoot appears. If you keep watering it the shoot will turn into a stalk and many fruits or vegetables will appear. Many children pay attention to their obsessions and eventually their obsessions and compulsions will grow just like the small seed.\n2. Tell the child to put their worries into words: Tell the child to think about what is really true as opposed to what they are afraid might happen. Reminding the child that if a bad thing happens they can get through it or they can make a plan to help them feel calmer and less worried. For example, the child may be afraid of someone breaking into his house. You can help by asking the child to challenge his thoughts. For example, you can ask the child: \u201cWhat makes you think that someone will break into the house?\u201d Did someone break into the house last night or the night before? they think that the alarm will not go off? You can also have him test the alarm so he can see and hear that it works and that if someone breaks into the house, the alarm will go off.\n3. Create a Worry Time: It is a good idea to spend less time on obsessions. If you do not spend time on them, they will eventually go away. Create a Worry Time with the child. During this time, you will sit with the child for about 15-20 minutes talking about whatever he or she is worried or obsessing about. This time should not be interrupted; instead it is a time where you will offer help and just listen. You can tell the child that if he has a worry to lock it up in their imaginary worry box, walk away and get distracted with something else. The worry that he\u2019s locked up will only be opened during worry time. If he distracts himself, the worry will lessen. The point for a worry box is to help children learn not to pay attention to their worries all the time because the worries will grow. By the time they reach"}

Under a program that began last fall, it has five drones and four certified operators.\nWhile the aerial search for the two hikers came up empty, it threw a spotlight on technology that can enter crevices and other spots unreachable by foot while sparing searchers the dangers of going up in a helicopter.\nWith its steep cliffs, nearly 2,000 square miles and mesmerizing views, the Grand Canyon can be as dangerous as it is captivating.\nRangers were confronted with 1,200 medical emergencies, 293 search-and-rescue missions and 17 deaths in 2016, a year in which it had nearly 6 million visitors. Last summer, a 35-year-old Yelp executive tripped while hiking, fell backward and was found dead 400 feet below.\nThe drones are about 18 inches across and 10 inches high, with a battery life of about 20 minutes. Drone operators watch the video in real time and then analyze it again at the end of the day.\nThe aircraft were used Monday through Wednesday in the search for LouAnn Merrell, 62, and her step grandson, Jackson Standefer, 14. The park also sent out three ground search teams of about 20 people in all, an inflatable motor boat and a helicopter.\nMerrell and Standefer vanished last weekend after losing their footing while crossing a creek near the North Rim. They were on a hike with Merrell\u2019s husband, Merrell Boot Co. co-founder Randy Merrell, and the boy\u2019s mother.\nOther national parks use drones, but for wildlife research. The use of private drones is prohibited in national parks.\nJames Doyle, a spokesman for the park service\u2019s Intermountain region, said other national parks will probably seek their own drone fleets, too. He said the Grand Canyon\u2019s extreme topography \u2014 it is a mile deep \u2014 makes it a perfect candidate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful tool for the unfortunate situation we just found ourselves in at Grand Canyon,\u201d Doyle said."}

Republicans and some oil- and gas-producing states in the U.S. - as well as Canada's minister of natural resources - cheered the report, but it further rankled environmentalists already at odds with Obama and his energy policy.\nThe report stops short of recommending approval of the pipeline, but the review gives Obama new support if he chooses to endorse it in spite of opposition from many Democrats and environmental groups. Foes say the pipeline would carry \"dirty oil\" that contributes to global warming, and they also express concern about possible spills.\nPushing back on the notion that the pipeline is now headed for speedy approval, the White House said the report isn't the final step and noted that the report includes \"a range of estimates of the project's climate impacts.\" Only after various U.S. agencies and the public have a chance to weigh the report and other data will a decision be made, said White House spokesman Matt Lehrich.\n\"The president has clearly stated that the project will be in the national interest only if it does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution,\" Lehrich said.\nRepublicans and business and labor groups have urged Obama to approve the pipeline to create thousands of jobs and move further toward North American energy independence. The pipeline is also strongly supported by Democrats in oil and gas-producing states, including Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. All face re-election this year and could be politically damaged by rejection of the pipeline. Republican Mitt Romney carried all three states in the 2012 presidential election.\nThe 1,179-mile pipeline would travel through the heart of the United States, carrying oil derived from tar sands in western Canada to a hub in Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. It would cross Montana and South Dakota before reaching Nebraska. An existing spur runs through Kansas and Oklahoma to Texas.\nThe report says oil derived from tar sands in Alberta generates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming than traditional crude. But the report makes clear that other methods of transporting the oil - including rail, trucks and barges - would release more greenhouse gases than the pipeline.\nU.S. and Canadian accident investigators warned last week about the dangers of oil trains that transport crude oil from North Dakota and other states to refineries in the U.S. and Canada. The officials urged new safety rules, cautioning that a major loss of life could result from an accident involving the increasing use of trains to transport large amounts of crude oil.\nAn alternative that relies on shipping the oil by rail through the central U.S. to Gulf Coast refineries would generate 28 percent more greenhouse gases than a pipeline, the report said.\nState Department approval is needed because the pipeline crosses a U.S. border. Other agencies will have 90 days to comment before Secretary of State John Kerry makes a recommendation to Obama on whether the project is in the national interest. A final decision"}

{"idx": "11417", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Comprehensive immigration reform is dead. For the foreseeable future, there is no chance that Congress will pass a grand bargain on immigration reform like the one that fell apart in 2007 including a mass amnesty or path to citizenship for most illegal immigrants already in the U.S. Nor is there any chance that the Dream Act, which would provide citizenship for many illegal immigrants as long as they attended college or served in the U.S. military, will be enacted into law. The Democrats could not pass the unpopular Dream Act even when they controlled both houses of Congress last December. Their cynical purpose in reintroducing it now is to play wedge issue politics with Latino voters in the run-up to the 2012 elections.\nAs in an old Perry Mason TV serial, or an Agatha Christie novel, the victim was murdered by multiple killers. The greatest wound may have been inflicted by the Great Recession. With mass unemployment expected to last for years to come, it is hard to imagine public support for an amnesty for the 12 million or so illegal immigrants in the U.S., particularly if it were not accompanied by adequate enforcement and encouraged a new wave of law-breaking by millions of foreign nationals in anticipation of future amnesties.\nBut even before the world economy collapsed in 2008, public opinion toward illegal immigration was hardening on both sides of the Atlantic. The backlash against mass immigration, legal and illegal, has contributed to the implosion of center-left social democratic parties in Europe. One unacknowledged goal of the war in Libya is to prevent enormous numbers of North African refugees from seeking asylum in Europe.\nIn the U.S., America's neoliberal globalist establishment has completely failed in its effort to persuade America's populist, nationalist citizenry that preventing illegal immigration is racist and retrograde in the age of global markets. According to a September 2010 Quinnipiac poll, \"stricter enforcement of laws against illegal immigration\" beat \"integrating illegal immigrants into American society\" by 68-24, with 9 percent answering \"don't know.\"\nshowed that 65 percent of Democrats support requiring people to produce documents proving their citizenship; 55 percent of Democrats would allow those who refuse to be detained; and 50 percent of Democrats would permit questioning based only on police suspicion. 45 percent of Democrats favored the Arizona law, while 46 percent opposed it. According to Pew, the more Democratic voters learn about the Arizona law, the more they approve of it.\nThe public opinion polls make it clear that there is no significant public support for what appears to be the consensus position of the American left -- yes to amnesty, no to enforcement.\nAny attempt to identify, apprehend or punish foreign nationals or American employers who violate immigration laws is immediately denounced as a racist atrocity by the American left. Progressive opposition to the illiberal Arizona law that permitted police officers to question individuals who might be illegal immigrants was justifiable. That provision of the law (not necessarily others) was an incitement to racial profiling. But many progressives also denounce sensible and necessary laws enabling the police to check the immigration status of people who have already been arrested; the use of E-Verify to make sure that the Social Security documents of workers have not been forged; and workplace raids by ICE on employers suspected of hiring illegal immigrants.\nIn addition to denouncing efforts by the government to catch foreign nationals and U.S. employers who break the law, the left opposes any penalties"}

This tired platitude is hardly worth discussing so I\u2019ll make a few brief jabs to knock this lightweight argument over.\nI would assume many, if not most Americans, below the age of 35 play video games. I would also assume many, if not most Americans, aren\u2019t school shooters or psychopaths. I know for a fact that video games are played all across the world, especially in Europe and Asia. I know for a fact that school shootings hardly, if ever, occur in those continents. Everyone can see kids and young adults play as post-apocalyptic road warriors and dragon-fighting vikings, yet know they\u2019ll never become those in real life.\nSo why are people, like our president and several other Republicans, tooting this rusted old horn? Could they possibly be this ignorant, or are they just going straight to the bottom of the barrel to search for reasons for school shootings, digging past gun legislation and mental illness? I can\u2019t find a single article that confirms the GOP\u2019s theories on the ties between video games and gun violence, although I can find copious amounts to the contrary. Doesn\u2019t that sound familiar, like a needle stabbing at the back of your mind; a vaccination needle perhaps?\nThe red elephant is not dying gracefully. In its old age it is becoming forgetful, clumsy and just isn\u2019t thinking straight. But make no mistake, it is dying. I can\u2019t possibly advocate for a vote for the Democrats as they have numerous problems I\u2019ve espoused in the past.

This was also in Stamford. That time, I did not check a website to see if I was scot-free because, even though the Internet was in worldwide use, it had not yet come to the judicial system of Connecticut. So I called a phone number, waited desperately to hear that I was off the hook, and -- despite an almost comical list of names, direct from a World War II hero flick (\"Rodriguez, Chin, Koslowski, O'Sullivan, Goldberg...\") -- I realized with a heavy heart that the god of hot, humid days spent in windowless basement rooms had screwed me over.\nI appeared at the appointed hour.

These include; 20 crude bombs, two gelatine sheets, a note on how to prepare bombs, one six-volt battery, a few loose wires, transistors, glue etc. The bombs recovered were all active and ready to be used.\nIt is apparent that the suspects were up to do something sinister because such a huge cache of dangerous items points that they were meant to launch a coordinated attack at several targets. The suspected targets could have been in Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Solapur and Nallasopara.\nMuslim\u2019s \u2018Bakrid\u2019 festival that falls on August 22, 2018, could have been the day of attack as that day animal sacrifice is being done as part religious obligation. This can be inferred because all those arrested in this case belong to one or other Hindu radical group.\nThose arrested are Vaibhav Raut (40), Sharad Kasalkar (25) Sharad Kasalkar (25). Raut is a sympathiser of the Hindu right wing organization Sanatan Sanstha. He is also a member of the Hindu Govansh Raksha Samiti and active in carrying out raids against beef traders for allegedly ferrying banned meat in the locality. Raut was under police watch and was arrested from his two-storey bungalow in Nallasopara along with another accused, Sharad Kasalkar.\nThe third accused, Sudhanwa Gondhalekar from Satara, is a member of the Shri Shivapratishthan Hindustan whose chief Sambhaji Bhide was booked by Pune Police in two criminal cases related to violence near Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018.\nA note recovered from Sharad Kasalkar house mentions the procedure to make a bomb and also had the phone number of the third accused, Sudhanwa Gondhalekar. The ATS had found that the duo was in constant touch with each other and had the knowledge of handling explosive.

Not surprisingly, the University of Michigan recruit handled it with poise, completing the most grueling triple on the books \u2014 the 3,200, 1,600 and 800. Only one other runner in state history has pulled off the feat of winning all three.\nHer time of 10:53.67 was two seconds ahead of Peyton Sippy of Janesville Craig. Davre said seeing her family in the stands made the moment particularly emotional.\n\"Especially my grandparents; they\u2019ve been taking me to national competitions since middle school, and that kind of opened to the door to what track is (to me),\" Davre said. \"Just saying goodbye to this experience, it\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s meant a lot to me.\"\nShe is the fifth girls athlete in state history to finish her career with 10 overall titles. That includes one relay, four 800s, four 1,600s and the 3,200.\n\"I don't really think of myself like that,\" Davre said of her historic achievements. \"It definitely makes me really emotional, I think about all the memories and teammates and everything. It's been such a good experience. It's just so special. I feel in my heart and I'm just really grateful.\"\nDavre went 2:12.07 in the 800 meters, the event where her 2:09.22 from 2015 will remain the state record at least another year. Earlier in the day, her 4:56.76 was good for a fourth and final state title in the 1,600.\nIt's old hat, and yet, Davre said she was nervous.\n\"Especially this year because it is my senior year,\" she said. \"My coaches have been working on always getting better. I just wanted to finish my high school season off really strong. ... This meet meant so much to me. I had to really fight at the end because I knew I had to race the clock at some point, but I'm glad it worked out. My whole family's here, so I really wanted to make them proud.\"\nDavre's attempt at the infamous triple was aided by a schedule change that moved both the 800 and 1,600 to the first day of competition. That freed her up to run the most demanding of the three events by itself on Saturday.\nShe said the pursuit wasn't a sure thing, even with the schedule.\n\"We had a decent 4x8 that would have been fun to be in,\" Davre said. \"I don't know how it would have worked at sectionals; sectionals is really challenging with those three races (in the same day).\"\nA soccer player at heart when she started at Whitefish Bay, Davre"}

Indeed, such environments are deadly to most life that has not evolved special adaptations to live in such conditions. Most take the form of simple life, such as bacteria.\nFor instance, visitors to Yellowstone Park have often marvelled at the bright colours displayed by the water from hydrothermal springs where the temperature of up to 110 C is hot enough to cook food. Bacteria, such as pyrolobus fumarii, make these conditions home. We call these creatures thermophiles, from the Greek heat-loving. Some bacteria also live in temperatures as low as -20 C.\nToxic environments, too, can support life. Lakes in desert areas contaminated with carbonate salts often have PH figures of 9 to 12, a nasty and corrosive alkaline mix that is deadly for most life. Volcanic springs often have, not only hot, but often acidic conditions that could dissolve metal, yet life survives there.\nIt appears that life can survive even more deadly environments, such as in the cooling and shielding waters of nuclear reactors. These bacteria can survive deadly ionizing radiation that would kill almost anything, yet they thrive. Other bacteria also can survive ultra-violet radiation from sunlight. UV radiation is normally used to sterilize surfaces in hospitals and food-handling equipment, yet some bacteria have the ability to get energy from these deadly rays.\nWe also have creatures who can survive conditions that can crush our strongest steel. Many complex creatures inhabit the deep oceanic trenches and make their homes there. At these depths, the pressure can reach 1086 bar. That is more than a thousand times our normal atmospheric pressure. Crustaceans, fish and bacteria all live in this cold dark water and appear to thrive.\nYou can also add the hottest and driest places on Earth to habitat for life. The Atacama Desert in Chile has life that thrives in such conditions and even some of the saltiest places on Earth have life that exists happily in conditions that would kill almost everything else. We have even found bacteria in the tailings from deep core drilling and in some of the deepest mines on the planet.\nNow scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography have discovered a population of complex life in parts of the ocean where the concentration of oxygen is less than one per cent of the concentration at its surface. This is an astounding finding. Sharks, eels and other large complex animals have energy needs that are far greater than simple bacteria, and their oxygen needs are correspondingly large. Yet it appears that the animals in this habitat have evolved mechanisms to allow them to survive under what would normally be hypoxic conditions.\nNow there are bacteria species which do not need oxygen to live. Indeed, they would be poisoned by the presence of oxygen in their environment. Such bacteria are called anaerobic and have a different"}

Together, they can discover what is going well for the student, as well as what could be improved.\nBesides looking at grades, which may be indicators of stronger or weaker areas, parents should keep in mind what goes into a \u201cgrade\u201d. Teachers often have different categories worth different percentages that combine to make a number, which translates into grades. Often teachers have categories that include homework, in-class work, participation, quizzes, tests, essays, and more. Usually tests and essays count a great deal more than the day to day homework assignments. What this means for parents is that besides looking at the overall grade, they can be thinking about how their student is doing in these different categories. If a parent (or the student) thinks his or her student isn\u2019t doing as well as he or she should be, looking at where the problem lies (which categories the student is lower in) is a great start toward fixing it. How the student feels about the class and what he or she is learning is important, too. If a student is not confident in the class, the work involved, or the content of the class, this could also impact the overall grade the student receives.\nNow is a good time for parents and students to connect with teachers and/or guidance counselors to discuss any areas of concern. With two more quarters to go, this is the time to try and help the students look at what they are doing well and ways they can improve.\nParents should keep in mind that teachers are often available, and willing, to help their students outside of the classroom. Contact with the teachers is very important because even though teachers have a student in class, sometimes they may not be aware of any issues a student may be having. Besides working with the teacher, there are tutors and tutoring agencies, like The Study Hall, who are there to help students succeed.\nHopefully \u201cthe talk\u201d that will be happening over these next few weeks will all be good ones, but if there are parents and students out there who would like to improve, take the time now to make a change.

{"idx": "11438", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Summary: Will Japan finally move toward acquiring offensive strike capabilities for the first time since World War II?\nAs North Korea demonstrates new advances in missile technology and continues developing nuclear weapons, U.S. policymakers must ask themselves: Will Japan finally move toward acquiring offensive strike capabilities for the first time since World War II? Should Washington welcome such an effort?\nOccasional surfacing of the so-called enemy base strike (teki kichi k\u014dgeki) debate in Japanese political circles often produces alarmist headlines and predictions of a remilitarized Japan, but in fact this strike debate has been percolating for decades and is still rooted in Japan\u2019s defensive military politics.\nThe following article and timeline explain the context and evolution of this strike capability discussion. It is an important defense policy initiative for the U.S.-Japan alliance to consider, even if it is less sensational than is frequently portrayed.\nJapan\u2019s debate over the constitutionality of enemy base strikes dates back to a 1956 statement made on behalf of then prime minister Ichir\u014d Hatoyama. It said that striking enemy missile bases should be permissible within certain limits: Japan can take only the \u201cminimum measures unavoidably necessary\u201d when \u201cno other measures\u201d of self-defense are available in the face of an \u201cimminent illegal invasion.\u201d This statement became the bedrock of all future debates that sought to clarify Hatoyama\u2019s interpretation, as part of a broader process to reconcile Japan\u2019s exclusively defense-oriented policy (sensh\u016b b\u014dei)\u2014which prohibits the procurement of certain offensive weapon systems\u2014with pressures caused by the continuing evolution of modern warfare. The strike debate began as a hypothetical exercise but became increasingly concrete from the late 1990s with a growing North Korea threat.\nThree main components make up the strike debate: When exactly can Japan use force overseas for self-defense? How should \u201cno other measures\u201d be defined? How are strike capabilities for self-defense reconcilable with the general belief that Japan\u2019s constitution prohibits offensive war-waging weapons? The historical timeline (see below) of statements by senior Japanese officials helps answer these questions.\nAs alarm over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s 2006 base strike comments showed, many non-Japanese journalists continue to commonly mistake enemy base strikes as potentially \u201cpreemptive.\u201d1 However, the record shows that Japanese officials have consistently rejected the concept of preemptive strikes (sensei k\u014dgeki).2 Part of this confusion stems from the vagueness of language and translation, but some inconsistent remarks made by Japanese lawmakers have also contributed.\nJapan\u2019s term for preemptive strikes (literally translated as \u201chead start attacks\u201d) does not account for the subtle nuance in English forms of \u201cpreventive,\u201d \u201cpreemptive,\u201d or \u201cfirst\u201d strikes, though it is generally understood to mean attacking before a conflict erupts (as opposed to preemptively hitting a target after a conflict has already started). The earliest explanations provided by Japanese leaders were clear that \u201cconvenient\u201d attacks for self-defense were not permissible and that only \u201cthe minimum measures unavoidably necessary\u201d would be allowed. Later comments in 1999 and 2003 on the timing of strikes seemed to broaden this understanding, suggesting that Japan could strike enemy missile bases \u201cat launch\u201d or even before launch, if for example Japan observed North Korea erecting a missile on a launcher while verbally threatening Japan.

{"idx": "11440", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Time Is Money -- How Much Is Your Time Worth?\nThe phrase has become hackneyed with overuse, yet hits the nail on the head when describing a small business owner\u2019s relationship to time. In fact, in a study conducted earlier this year by the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA), the 592 respondents reported that they valued their time at an average of $170 per hour\u2014making wasted time an expensive proposition for those small businesses.\nEntrepreneurs understand the importance of managing time unlike just about anyone else. Creating jobs (two out of every three new jobs in the U.S.) isn\u2019t a 9:00 to 5:00 proposition. This week OnDeck released a new survey that suggests America\u2019s small business owners spend an average of 53 hours a week building their businesses compared to the national average workweek of 47 hours. What\u2019s more, one-third of the business owners surveyed said they would need 69 hours a week to successfully run their businesses.\nA longer-than-average day was certainly my experience as a small business owner. Like many business owners, I was motivated and felt my business required more of my time. However my wife would often call the office into the wee hours of the morning to ask if she needed to bring over a sleeping bag\u2014my cue it was time to wrap up for the day and come home.\nBy the way, although 45 percent of them described work/life balance as an illusion, other surveys suggest the independence of working for themselves is worth it. That\u2019s certainly the way I looked at it.\nWhy Would a Small Business Lender Be Interested in How a Business Owner Values Time?\nThat\u2019s a good question with a very straightforward answer.\nSpeed to funding is a big deal to businesses and the time it takes to find a lender, complete the application, and hopefully obtain approval can take a business owner away from the important work of running the business. In fact, 63 percent of those in the ETA survey said speed was a primary reason for choosing the online lender they did. The ability to act quickly to take advantage of an opportunity is often critical to successfully leveraging that opportunity into increased profits.\nAccording to a 2014 New York Federal Reserve survey, the average small business owner spends 33 hours applying for a small business loan. As a business owner, whether or not you value your time at $170 per hour or something else, those 33 hours become expensive\u2014particularly when you consider the number of applicants that leave the traditional small business loan process empty handed.\nThe time it takes to find financing is a challenge for many small businesses and an opportunity cost that is simply too high. It\u2019s not the decline rate that troubles me, but the lost time waiting for the decline.\nTechnology has changed the way we shop, the way we make travel arrangements, and even the way we hail a cab. In much the same way, technology can now streamline the loan process and give businesses faster answers so they can make decisions about the growth opportunities they can pursue, and those they can\u2019t.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s not just technology, it\u2019s looking at small business lending from a completely different paradigm. How lenders evaluate business creditworthiness and the type of financing they offer are all part of the equation. There are even traditional lenders that are recognizing the problem and working on solutions.\nWhat Would You Do With an Extra 33 Hours?\nWhat if a small business owner could get some of those hours back?\nI seldom talk about what we\u2019re doing at OnDeck in this column,"}

Back in January 29, 1979, at 8.30am, Spencer, then a geeky looking 16-year-old, took out the .22 rifle her father had bought her as a Christmas present and pointed it through her bedroom window.\nAcross from her home in San Diego, pupils were lining up outside Grover Cleveland Elementary School. Spencer squeezed the trigger, firing off 36 bullets.\nThere then followed a six-hour stand-off, during which a reporter from the San Diego Evening Tribune, Gus Stevens, began calling houses in the neighbourhood trying to get information.\nOne was that of the Spencer residence and the teenager picked up the phone.\nSpencer pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon. On April 4, 1980, a day after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\nIt is only since the parole process started in 1993 that she has expressed remorse. Diagnosed with epilepsy and as a depressive, she said she was drinking alcohol and on phencyclidine \u2013 angel dust \u2013 which made her hallucinate when she opened fire.\nControversially, she also alleged her father had sexually abused her. \u201cI had to share my dad\u2019s bed til I was 14 years old,\u201d she said during a 2009 hearing. Her father denied her claims.\nAnd yet the model prisoner maintains she is no murderer, refusing to take full responsibility, instead blaming her upbringing. \u201cI had asked for a radio but got a gun instead,\u201d she said.\nEstimates suggest that since Spencer\u2019s killings, 350,000 pupils in 400 schools have witnessed a gun attack in the US. It is one of the reasons her bid for freedom is so bitterly opposed by many, including Mr Wragg\u2019s family.\nHis granddaughter Haley, 26, said: \u201cI know there was a lot of turmoil in the family every time Brenda was up for parole.\nChristy Buell, who with her friend Cam Miller was hit by several of Spencer\u2019s bullets, also objects to her release.

Both of these funds have an expiry date of 2013 and Berlin is looking to see that something more substantial replaces them before then.\nThe default mechanism would signal to investors that they, rather than taxpayers alone, would be on the hook for at least part of the costs of the bankruptcy of a country. The mechanism is designed to deal with sovereign defaults without setting off a cascading panic in the markets similar to the Greek debt crisis that shook Europe in spring.\nThe idea is highly controversial, with even the reticent European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet voicing steadfast opposition.\nMore controversial still is the opinion of Ms Merkel's lawyers that a permanent fund and the default procedure require a change to the EU treaty. Germany is worried that its Constitutional Court would slap down any extension of the Greek-type bail-out on the basis that the current EU treaty specifically rules out member state rescues.\nThe Franco-German alliance also wants spendthrift states to be stripped of their voting rights within the Council of Ministers - a move that everyone agrees would require a treaty change.\nFor all their power, Berlin and Paris are believed to be almost isolated among the 27 on this question.\nEurozone chief Jean-Claude Juncker said of the idea on Thursday morning that: \"The withdrawal of voting rights for budget-sinning countries isn't a possible way forward and I reject any changes to the EU treaty in this case.\"\nLuxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said there is a \"risk that we will be plunged back into months and years of navel-gazing,\" referring to the 10-year-long period of EU introspection and internecine warfare that led up to Lisbon.\nAs one incredulous EU diplomat put it ahead of the summit: \"Do you really believe the Irish prime minister can head back to Ireland and tell his people they have to vote in favour of removing their voting rights?\"\nItaly, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK are believed to be adamantly opposed to the voting rights sanctions proposal.

Photo credit: Darren Cheng.\nRacing solar cars isn't exactly a new phenomenon. Collegiate level solar car racing has been taking place since at least 1990, according to the Innovators Educational Foundation, which puts on the American Solar Challenge. But the importance of these test/research vehicles is starting to show its worth on the streets.\nFord's C-Max Energi is covered with SunPower solar cells, which charge the vehicle during the day. Source: SunPower.\nThis year, Ford (NYSE: F) announced that the C-Max Energi will be fitted with SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) solar cells on the roof. These cells will power the battery whether the car is in operation or not, giving almost enough energy to fully charge the 21-mile electric range each day.\nThis is the first of these solar-electric vehicles to hit the market, but with the success of vehicles like Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S, I would be surprised if we didn't see more. Earlier this year, I calculated that even a small 300-watt array on the roof of a Model S -- the same size as C-Max Energi's array -- could provide over 2,000 miles of range without plugging the vehicle in. If cells are added to more than the roof, that figure could rise to over 5,000 miles of range from on-board solar.\nRight now, solar cars racing across the country show just how much potential there is for solar in the auto industry, especially now that electric vehicles are taking off. If automakers can begin incorporating some of the same technology into commercial vehicles, it will not only save EV owners from going to the pump, they'll be able to charge up without plugging in.\nNot only are SunPower's cells more efficient than competitors, the construction allows for an all-black design that improves aesthetics when applied to a car.

Died: 30 December, 2012, in London, aged 78.\nAlexander Schouvaloff had long standing connections with the arts in Scotland, principally through the Festival, but he was a keen observer of many arts companies here. He was an authority on the Diaghilev company and especially its famous designers \u2013 Pablo Picasso, L\u00e9on Bakst and Alexandre Benois. Schouvaloff wrote widely on the period and curated a hugely successful exhibition (Parade) at the 1979 Edinburgh Festival in the Edinburgh College of Art that was acclaimed for its design ingenuity. It was so successful, in fact, that it transferred to the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\nAlexander Schouvaloff came from an aristocratic and diplomatic Russian family. His father won an Oscar for his designs for Moulin Rouge (directed by John Huston).\nSchouvaloff attended Harrow School where he showed early theatrical talent, playing the title role in a complete version of Hamlet. While at Jesus College, Oxford he came with the Oxford Theatre Group to the 1954 Edinburgh Fringe.\nSchouvaloff did his national service with the Royal Military Police at SHAPE in Paris and, in 1965, became George Harewood\u2019s assistant for one year and then for two years worked with Peter Diamand at the Edinburgh Festival.\nBoth directors concentrated on the music and opera programme and gave Schouvaloff a free hand to develop theatre projects. He brought such adventurous productions as Pop Theatre\u2019s The Trojan Women with Flora Robson and Cleo Laine and The Cherry Orchard by The Prospect Company with Lila Kedrova.\nHe is particularly remembered in Edinburgh for the Parade exhibition in 1979. In fact, Schouvaloff used the wide-open spaces of the College of Art admirably and while it displayed many costumes it was the magnificent designs by Bakst that Schouvaloff showed with particular panache.\nIn 1974 he was appointed the founder curator of the Theatre Museum, which came under the auspices of the V& A. The museum had many theatrical collections which had need of a permanent home \u2013 not least Richard Buckle\u2019s mainly Diaghilev costumes which had been seen at his famous 1954 Edinburgh Festival exhibition. Schouvaloff had to overcome increasing political and financial setbacks \u2013 at one point there was a high profile campaign, Save the Theatre Museum.\nSchouvaloff and Sir Roy Strong, curator at the V&A, eventually decided on a building on the piazza at Covent Garden, close by the Royal Opera House.

He said he hopes other companies feel pressured to make similar moves.\n\"It may be not so well known in the U.S. how intensive the marketing of soft drinks is in so many countries,\" Mr. Puska said in an interview from Finland. He added that developing countries such as Mexico are particularly affected by this strong marketing.\nCoca-Cola this month changed its global sales policy to say it won't sell any of its drinks worldwide in primary schools unless parents or school districts ask. The policy does not apply to secondary schools. The World Heart Federation wants all drinks with added sugars removed from schools with children through age 18.\nCoca-Cola, based in Atlanta, did not immediately return a request seeking comment Tuesday.\nPepsiCo's policy requires cooperation from its bottlers, vending companies and other distributors who take the company's products to schools worldwide. The company said it did not have exact figures for sales in schools around the world but said they did not make up a major portion of sales.\nIn primary schools, PepsiCo will sell only water, fat-free or low-fat milk, and juice with no added sugar. In secondary schools, it will sell those drinks along with low-calorie soft drinks, such as Diet Pepsi. Sports drinks are permissible when they're sold to students participating in sports or other physical activities.\nIn the U.S., the industry has swapped lower-calorie options into schools to replace sugary drinks. Sales of full-calorie soft drinks fell 95% in U.S. schools between fall 2004 and fall 2009, the American Beverage Association reported last week.\nThe industry voluntarily adopted guidelines in 2006 as part of an agreement with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a joint initiative of former President Bill Clinton's foundation and the American Heart Association.\nMr. Puska said defeating childhood obesity isn't as simple as just removing sugary drinks from schools. Students must also exercise and eat better, not just at school but at home as well. Students should learn these habits at schools, he said."}

Thibaut Courtois raged at France's approach, claiming that they didn't try to play against a side that was stronger than them.\nBut the strongest side advanced here.

Two summers ago in Marseille, a semi-final triumph over Germany was greeted in the same manner and it was followed by a spectacular anti-climax.\nThat experience should check any exuberance. Yet this is a side that is slowly working its way through the gears, from an unimpressive opening grind against Australia to this purposeful dismissal.\nIt has been said that this tournament is devoid of an outstanding side, yet it's France that have the raw materials to reach that status.\nGranted, it didn't look that way in the early minutes. This was a gripping match, albeit one that was played out in a curious atmosphere.\nThe European sides really haven't brought much to this competition in terms of travelling support and it was brutally apparent during a first half where the most sustained period of singing came from Brazilian fans who had bought their tickets on the assumption they would make it this far.\nBut the quality of the fare highlighted why these teams had emerged from the stronger half of the draw. Big names made their presence felt.\nMbappe set the tone for his own display with a purposeful change of pace and burst down the flank inside 30 seconds. Eden Hazard followed it up with a thrilling dart of his own as play quickly switched to the other end, with the Chelsea star's tormenting of Benjamin Pavard a feature of the first half.\nFrance were second best in the period where punters were remarkably still making their way to their seats.

He also pushed his stale argument that the investigation into questions of collusion between Russian meddlers and his presidential campaign is nothing more than a Democratic fabrication to explain away how that party lost the election. Then he suggested canceling daily press briefings because his spokespeople can't get the White House facts straight (never mind that the facts seem to change with every breath the president takes).\nBuried in the morning rant was a dangerously worded warning to James Comey, the recently fired director of the FBI: \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\"\nWhat exactly was the threat? That Trump did indeed record those conversations and he might release audio to rebut whatever comments Comey might make? That seems to be the clearest reading of a typically muddy Trump tweet. And if so, that means evidence should be available to shed light on how the president of the United States used a private meeting with his FBI director to seek inside information on the status of an investigation into the actions of some of Trump's campaign aides.\nIn his press briefing Friday morning (yes, he's still holding them), just hours after Trump's tweets, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer refused to say whether the president had indeed recorded conversations with Comey (Democratic members of the House Judiciary Oversight Committee immediately requested copies of the tapes if they exist). And Spicer denied that Trump had asked Comey for his loyalty in a dinner meeting, as the New York Times reported. The story added that Comey declined but pledged that he would act honestly. Given how many lies, distortions and errors have come out of the White House press office since the inauguration, Spicer's denial of the New York Times version doesn't bear much weight.\nThis is dangerous ground when the nation's presumption whenever the president or his spokespeople say something has to be disbelief. Nothing can be taken at face value, from White House estimates of the size of the inauguration crowd, to Spicer denying that Trump's effort to block entry of refugees and travelers from a number of predominantly Muslim countries is a \"ban\" (the word Trump has used), to the events that led to Comey's dismissal.\nMost alarming, though is that Trump himself doesn't understand that the president of the United States is powerful, but not omnipotent, something he seems to crave as part of an irrepressible authoritarian instinct. He doesn't want to be president, he wants to be emperor. He has praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, shrugging off the anti-crime crusader's admissions that he has murdered. He congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a referendum that shifted power from the parliament to his own office. His adoration of Russian President Vladimir Putin borders on the embarrassing.\nLeaks from the White House disclose a president who lashes out at aides when news coverage churns beyond his control. He has threatened to change libel laws to make it easier to sue over articles he doesn't like (and is seemingly oblivious to the fact that libel laws are state-level and beyond his reach). Never mind the Supreme Court's history of defending the media's 1st Amendment right to publish what it wants about public figures as long as the material is factual or that errors were not published with malice or reckless disregard for the truth."}

Each week, Financial Post contributor Mary Teresa Bitti revisits the previous week\u2019s episode. She captures what the cameras didn\u2019t and in the process provides a case study for readers, zeroing in on what pitchers and dragons were thinking and what the challenges for the deal are going forward.\nThe pitch As sales director for an underground mobile equipment manufacturer, Alicia Woods spends her fair share of time underground, understanding the challenges of customers. She recalls the first time she had to go into a mine 14 years ago. She was handed full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), coveralls, belt, hard hat but nothing was designed for women. \u201cI was given the smallest men\u2019s sizes but nothing fit properly and it wasn\u2019t convenient, especially if I had to use the washroom facilities, which are typically a port-a-potty,\u201d Ms. Woods says.\nThe only alternative she found online was a shirt and pants. She preferred the coverall which offers better protection. She sketched a few concepts that got put to the side as her career started to grow and she and her husband started a family. For 10 years, she would have nothing to drink if she knew she\u2019d be going down into a mine, to avoid having to use the washroom.\nMs. Woods began working with a seamstress in Sudbury to develop her first sample. It took about eight months, during which time she researched market potential and quickly realized she had an eager audience. In the mining industry alone, 15% of the workforce is female or 21,000 women, who typically purchase two to five coveralls at a time two to three times a year. Working with a Montreal manufacturer that has been producing male work wear for the past 40 years, Covergalls, the first Canadian-made and designed coverall for women launched in spring 2013. Special features include a drop back, secured pockets and snaps at the wrists for a better fit.\nBy the fall, major mining companies began to show interest and sales, which were largely through a distributor, were ramping up. In spring 2014, right around the time Ms. Woods pitched the dragons, she launched an online store.\nAt the time she faced the dragons, Covergalls had sales of $61,000 with a forecast of $180,000 by the end of the year. The product ranges in price from $130 to $282 depending on the material, striping and colour.\nThe deal Ms. Woods asked for $75,000 in exchange for a 20% stake, with the funds targeted to building inventory by placing a large order to achieve economies of scale, improve margins and build brand. She received four offers and accepted a deal from Michael Wekerle, Arlene Dickinson and Jim Treliving for $75,000 for a 30% stake. Mr. Treliving has since dropped out of the negotiations.

The same consumer DNA testing kits that trace ancestry and offer genetic risk assessments were proposed as a way to reunite families separated at the border. But the idea created its own minor furor \u2014 for one, the fact that the government would even need DNA tests to match a detained child to a parent. Second, the fear over privacy and security risks.\nAfter more than 2,700 children were taken from their parents by officials at the border under President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy,\u201d it became clear that there was no solid system in place to bring families back together.\nWhen immigrant children are separated from families, they are placed in government facilities or foster care while officials try to identify the nearest relative in the United States. But there are suspicions about how carefully these \u201crelatives\u201d are filtered. With facilities overflowing, there are allegations that many children may had been lost in the system or handed to traffickers.\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement told Congress in April that of the 7,000 children returned to relatives in fall 2017, it had lost track of 1,475 children. A PBS Frontline investigation called \u201cTrafficked in America\u201d that aired in April also discovered cases of teenagers being released to labor traffickers by the ORR.\nDNA testing kits could solve the issue by identifying relatives accurately. Google-backed 23andMe was prompted to offer its genetic-testing service by California Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), joining the same initiative as other genetic companies, such as MyHeritage.\n\u201cI continue to be blown away by the outpouring of support from my constituents and companies in my district, including 23andMe,\u201d Speier said in a statement to CNBC.\n23andMe and MyHeritage are among the genetic-testing companies donating thousands of kits and working with relevant government and nonprofit organizations to distribute resources. But these companies also provoke fears about privacy and ownership of DNA.\nBoth RAICES Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project, prominent civil rights groups in the immigration movement, declined DNA kit offers.\n\u201cThese are already very vulnerable communities, and this would potentially put their privacy at risk,\u201d RAICES spokeswoman Jennifer Falcon told the San Francisco-based national public radio station KQED.\nSecurity concerns are a primary reason for hesitation. Typically, if an individual under the age of 18 wants to provide a DNA sample, authorization by a parent or guardian is required. In this case, because the children cannot find their parents and are considered under the authority of the government, the question of who grants authority and gains access to the information is up in the air.\n\u201cThere are problems giving it to a commercial testing company.

After pumping the ceremonial wood mace in the air to a standing ovation, Waldron outlined her plans for the 155-year-old school in Wayne.\n\"We stand for what is best about public universities,\" said Waldron, 62. \"We are a home for research and innovation, a place for learning and scholarship, a center for creative arts and music, a pathway for social mobility for diverse students and a partner with our communities.\"\nThe new president said her goals are to expand enrollment at the 11,000-student university, hire more professors, start new academic programs, build a new parking garage and renovate aging campus buildings. But she stressed campus improvements should not be \"over the top\" in the current economic climate.\nWaldron, former president of Baruch College, took over as William Paterson\u2019s seventh president in August. She was hired for the $295,000-a-year post after a national search to replace Arnold Speert, who retired after 25 years on the job.\nThe university\u2019s trustees hired Waldron partly because of her financial background as a top executive at Citibank. Like all of New Jersey\u2019s public colleges, William Paterson is facing deep cuts in state funding.\nWaldron used her inaugural speech to pledge to keep the school affordable and accessible. Annual undergraduate tuition and fees are $11,238.\n\"If William Paterson, our namesake, were alive today it is doubtful that he would have graduated college given his modest family origins,\" Waldron said.\nTim Farrell/The Star-LedgerThe faculty of William Paterson University parade through the campus during the induction of Kathleen Waldron as the seventh president.\nOver the last century, William Paterson University \u2014 named after a New Jersey statesman and signer of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 has grown from a small teacher training school to a 11,000-student university with more than 250 degree programs.\nThe university spent a relatively-modest $25,000 on Waldron\u2019s inauguration, which included a lunch of roast turkey and pumpkin gnocchi for about 500 people in the student center, school officials said.\n\"As requested by President Waldron, we have planned an investiture ceremony that captures the significance of this important university milestone in a modest manner,\" said Steve Bolyai, the university\u2019s vice president for administration and finance.\nWaldron was welcomed by a long line of speakers, including Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) and Rutgers University President Richard McCormick. The front rows of the audience were filled with her relatives and a contingent of former colleagues from Citibank.\nNaima Ricks, president of William Paterson\u2019s student government, said Waldron has already made an impression on students by attending numerous student meetings and events.\n\"Something that might seem so minor is extremely important to the students.

Sony\u2019s studios are already working on a single-player campaign add-on for the game, and if the trailer is any indication, there are still more battles to fight and more mysteries to uncover. There\u2019s also more Ellie, a surprise favorite character from the title\u2019s debut earlier this year. The company didn\u2019t confirm an exact date for the Left Behind DLC for The Last of Us. Instead, Sony says users should expect the add-on \u201cearly next year.\u201d Users can pre-order the DLC from the PlayStation Store for $14.99 beginning November 19th.\nThe company also announced a follow-up in its very popular Uncharted series of games.

In fact, the title is so early in development that Sony didn\u2019t even detail a launch window for it.\nPS4 users can also expect TowerFall Ascension, a multiplayer strategy game that tasks users with utterly decimating their friends in direct combat. The game won\u2019t win any awards for detailed graphics, but it seems tailor-made for users who simply want to play a fun game with friends and family. Sony also confirmed that TowerFall would make its way the PlayStation Store sometime in 2014.\nSony didn\u2019t end it there either. The company also confirmed that gamers on its system will get early access to the beta of Destiny, the first-person shooter/adventure in production from Bungie Studios.

This, together with the lengthy administrative procedure in place to clear consignments implies that animals are likely to stay at least six hours in the vehicles just to cross the border,\" the report said.\nIt noted that the border crossing had \"limited opening times\" and that companies transporting animals to Turkey had to take that into account when planning journeys through Kapikule \u2013 or \"risk not complying\" with the EU regulation.\nThe regulation says that vehicles transporting animals are required to have ventilation systems that keep the temperature between 5C and 30C \u2013 with a 5C tolerance margin \u2013 regardless of whether the vehicles was moving or standing still.\nLast year's commission report said that in 2016, there were 96 days when temperatures at Kapikule were above 30C, and 34 days when they were above 35C.\nIt noted that in 2016 the number of live ruminants exported to Turkey was over 290,000.\nThe commission sent letters to all EU states about this issue on 26 April and 16 July.

After the lockdown of the economy in January 2012 during which the polity was rocked to its foundations, it would seem a bit too much that government would seek to re-open the fuel subsidy matter so soon \u2013 at least not with the wounds still fresh.\nBut here we are \u2013 some fourteen months after \u2013 with the President making a fresh bid to take out the \u201cremaining\u201d subsidy. Of course, it didn\u2019t come with new or compelling arguments being advanced; rather it was a case of being stuck with the same old lines of unreason and obduracy. The presidential edict was unambiguously declarative: \u201cwe cannot continue to waste resources meant for a greater number of Nigerians to subsidise the affluent middle class, who are the main beneficiaries of fuel subsidy\u201d.\nI suppose it is late in the day to embark on the task of re-educating the administration on its fixation with the so-called subsidy on petrol. Or to the fact that it has barely thought through an agreeable solution to the fuel subsidy conundrum in the whole of the last 14 months. Or even to remind it of its failure to deliver basic services to the Nigerian people all of which have rendered the ordinary citizen endangered.\nI guess it\u2019s alright for the overfed, corrupt and the utterly inept governing elite to pick on the vanishing middle class as practice target after laundering billions of naira among its friends in the subsidy scam. Fair game isn\u2019t it?\nWhat this goes to show however is that the nation still has a long way to go to resolve the fuel-supply riddle. If it seems any indication, Nigeria Labour Congress\u2019 rejection of the planned hike in petrol price and government\u2019s insistence on being tragically beholden to the subsidy removal idea would seem to point at the battle ahead.\nI need to be clear in my views about the subsidy. It is bad for the economy; I verily believe it is \u2013 in the long run. But the long run is not here, yet! I will argue that the pump price of petrol, to the extent that it is not cost-reflective, is ultimately injurious to the economy. I must say that one of the difficult tasks I have had is convincing my friends that the current price of N97 per litre is actually below cost price \u2013 using the Petroleum Products Prices Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)\u2019s reference landing cost of N131.10. And this cost is even exclusive of the distribution costs. Such has been the touchy nature of the subsidy mathematics that not many would even agree with the figures despite their being verifiable. I have since given up attempting to convince anyone on how perverse the current regime of subsidy is.\nBut then, the point about the subsidy regime is that it is the effect, not the cause of the problem. It is the by-product of the political economy of abdication, the strange political economy under which an oil producing nation would export raw crude while importing its refined products wholesale. As for the sustainability of the annual payout drawn from the treasury \u2013 nearly a trillion naira by current estimates \u2013 I am yet to see anyone contest the fact that the expenditure is wasteful, barely supportable but definitely outrageous.

But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction.\nKubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score.

But, as far back as 1937, the belief that mundanity had a currency for historians spurred three young men to start an ambitious and radical project.\nWhen Mass Observation began, members of the public were invited to help with a new research project on daily life in Britain - a \"science of ourselves\".\nAs well as asking volunteers to keep diaries, Mass Observation's researchers interviewed people in the street, listened in to conversations, and observed public behaviour in places like pubs and factories.\nIt wanted to thwart the tendency in modern society to live our daily lives deadened by habit, \"with as little consciousness of our surroundings as though we were walking in our sleep\".\nMass Observation, or MO, churned out millions of words on mundane subjects such as filling in the football pools, the contents of sweet shop window displays and the way that smokers held their cigarettes.\nFor a brief period, Mass Observation's interest in our daily lives captured the public imagination. One of its early books, simply called Britain, shifted 100,000 copies in its first 10 days.\nAfter World War II, though, the project petered out as its volunteers dispersed and its founders moved on. For years MO's findings were largely forgotten. But 70 years after it began, it is re-entering public consciousness - and Victoria Wood's ITV drama is not the only sign.\nThe Magazine is compiling a People's History of Modern Britain - send your memories of the 1960s, in text, pictures or short videos.\nSome of the other diaries written by MO volunteers during and just after World War II have been collected in three bestselling anthologies by Simon Garfield. Such writings seem to anticipate our current interest in personal testimony, be it ghost-written celebrity autobiographies or memoirs of ordinary people.\nThe MO archive at the University of Sussex has also informed books such as David Kynaston's Austerity Britain, 1945-1951, which is currently riding high in the bestsellers' lists, and Jon Savage's recent Teenage: The Creation of Youth 1875-1945.\nThese files are the perfect resource for the growing trend for \"history from below\" - the story of ordinary people rather than of political and cultural elites.\nBut MO's observations can also teach us something about our own lives today. One of its original aims was to challenge what it called \"the voicelessness of everyman\". It wanted to make ordinary citizens' lives and opinions better known to the people who governed them.\nWhen it began in the 1930s, opinion formers made no real attempt to find out the views of voters. Ordinary people were rarely seen or heard on film or radio.\nMO's founders were annoyed by the lazy assumptions about \"the man in the street\" by the media and political elite - \"a tiny group, with different habits of mind, ways of life, from those millions they are catering for\".\nMO's most significant legacy is that it made ordinary people visible and audible, perhaps for the first time.

The study, titled Poplar, is expected to produce top-line data in the second half of 2019.\nAnaptysBio also delivered on its promise to begin a phase 2 trial with people who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, a condition in need of new treatment options.

(NASDAQ:TSRO) also contributed a $5 million milestone payment in return for beginning a phase 3 trial with TSR-042. If the lung cancer candidate eventually earns approval, Tesaro will give AnaptysBio a single-digit royalty percentage.\nAnaptysBio reported positive results from an ongoing phase 2a trial with its lead candidate, etokimab. Compared with the placebo group, patients given the IL-33 inhibitor showed an 8% improvement in the amount of air they can exhale after two days, and the effect appears durable. At the 64-day checkup, patients showed an 11% improvement.\nThe company continued enrolling patients into a 300-patient phase 2b eczema trial with etokimab.

The Wisconsin Idea is the university\u2019s guiding principle, asserting that the education provided here impacts people outside the doors of the classroom. Practically synonymous with Wisconsin for nearly a century, the Wisconsin Idea transcends the boundaries of its inception and is a guiding principle for our relationship with other states and nations.\nIt is also a guiding principle that has many questioning the utility of the research the Wisconsin Idea is meant to inspire. One of history\u2019s greatest inventors, Thomas Alva Edison, channeled his research to a different philosophy. He said \u201cAnything that won\u2019t sell, I don\u2019t want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.\u201d This pragmatic philosophy guided us to some of the most important inventions in history, like the first commercial light bulb or the motion picture camera. Both philosophies seemingly flow together, but they must remain in perfect balance for UW to remain successful.\nThe monetary success associated with big-name companies suggest that universities like ours should shift to a more Edison-like approach \u2014 that is, increased entrepreneurial research. Indeed, many companies that are now household names began as research by college students. Google began as a Ph.D. project of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two graduate students at Stanford University. Facebook began in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s dorm room while he was an undergraduate at Harvard. And let us not forget EatStreet, the food delivery site once known as BadgerBites, whose founders met as freshman right here at UW. According to the Association of University Technology Managers, intellectual derived from university research accounted for 1,024 startup companies in 2016.\nStatistics show that entrepreneurial research is more than beneficial for economic growth. Therefore, many contend that Wisconsin should shift away from the expectations of being published in academic journals and securing research grants and put more emphasis on obtaining licenses, patents and starting businesses. In essence, abandon classic scientific research for research that sells.\nBut the issue is more nuanced than this camp lets on. Above all else, UW is a public university and public universities juggle many responsibilities. Focusing strictly on scientific entrepreneurial research takes away from the university\u2019s core educational mission. Only focusing on what is profitable means losing an exorbitant amount of knowledge that could be revolutionary if given the correct amount of time to be developed.\nSimilarly, scientific research may impede business while still benefiting humanity overall. When chlorofluorocarbons were created, they were a revolutionary product. They\u2019re non-toxic, non-flammable, not soluble in water and easily convertible from liquid to gas and vice versa, making them perfect for aerosols and other products. But when it was discovered that the chlorine in CFCs depleted the ozone layer, they were banned. Science impeded business but helped improve the global environment.\nThat\u2019s not an isolated example either. The work of Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech led to the discovery of the Flint water crisis. Residents of Flint refuse to have their water tested by any company hired by the city \u2014 a negative hit to business. Edwards has faced backlash from every institution imaginable, yet his discovery and advocacy began the righteous fight for the health and well-being of Fl"}

Ted Cruz.\n\"We are looking into the legislative text on the Cruz bill,\" she told reporters.\nLife had been tough for administration officials forced, unlike Trump, to undergo questioning Monday and make policy arguments that could not match the emotional storm stirred by the separations.\n\"Separating parents from children is not a policy that we want to pursue.

Read on for highlights.\nXconomy: How did OwnerIQ evolve from websites filled with downloadable user manuals into a data and marketing technology company for retailers and brands?\nJay Habegger: It seems to me a very logical and streamlined path, but I\u2019m sure from the outside looking in, it may not be as obvious. We founded the company on a simple, straightforward idea that advertising would be better for the advertiser and the recipient if it were targeted on the basis of things you owned and were in the market for. \u2026 That concept underpins all loyalty programs at grocery stores. We wanted to apply it more broadly.\nBack in \u201908, we had hit upon an innovative way of acquiring some of that info, which was consumers would tell us by engaging with product support content. We still have that business. We\u2019re still the web\u2019s largest source of product support information, user manuals, and stuff like that.\nWhat we did is put those two things together, which is effectively the Q today. We help retailers and brands take the audience going to their website and manage that audience, transform it into digital advertising opportunities to use with them and their marketing partners.\nX: I read that at the end of each year you like to reflect on the past year and write down professional and personal goals for the next year. What\u2019s on your list for 2016?\nJH: For the business, it is this concept of second-party data, executing on that all the time.

I think that some of the technologies we\u2019re looking to deploy this year\u2014some things we already deployed are better ways of looking at geography when running an ad campaign.

The Phillies beat the Orioles 5-4, but they still figure to be a road-weary team on Friday when they play in their third city in three nights.\nAlso, while Chen has been truly awful on the road this year with a 10.47 ERA that is the worst in the majors, he has been remarkably good at home. His home ERA of 1.89 is the ninth best in the majors this year among pitchers with at least 30 innings in their own stadiums.\nFurther, while Arrieta has been solid overall this season with a 6-6 record and a 3.47 ERA, he has struggled in two starts against the Marlins. His numbers against the Marlins read like this: 7 2/3 innings, 9.39 ERA.\nFrom a team standpoint, the Marlins are coming off a series in which they took two of three games from the Milwaukee Brewers, who have the best record in the NL.\nMoreover, the Marlins \u2014 since April 23 \u2014 are much improved with a 34-40 record during that span, roughly half a season in which they have played close to .500 ball.

Realmuto \u2014 back from a three-game paternity leave.\nIn addition, the Marlins have standouts such as right fielder Brian Anderson, who has 105 hits and is batting .288. Not since Corey Seager of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2016 has a rookie had that many hits before the All-Star Game.\nMeanwhile, the Phillies have a lineup that is led by, among others, outfielder Rhys Hoskins, who hit 18 homers in 50 games last year in his first season in the majors.\nHoskins, 25, has fallen a bit from that impressive homer rate but has gone deep 14 times in 83 games.\nIn addition, Hoskins on Wednesday was selected to compete in the 2018 Home Run Derby."}

Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that Israel is ready to return to the negotiating table without preconditions and dictations, but the Arab initiative is a dictation - first we need to give up territory, then the Arabs would consider a relationship with us.\"\nThe Arab Peace Initiative, unveiled in 2002 by Saudi Arabia, says that 22 Arab countries will normalize ties with Israel in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria.\nIt was recently revived when Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister indicated that he supported a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that would be defined by the June 4, 1967 borders, but at the same time backed U.S. President Barack Obama's proposals for a \"comparable and mutual agreed minor swap of the land\" between Israel and the PA, to reflect the realities of the burgeoning communities on the ground.\n\"We are ready to come immediately and talk about everything, without preconditions, but not just about territory,\u201d Yaalon said in Washington. \u201cThe Palestinians have preconditions, and therefore the possibility to begin talks is delayed. We are ready to discuss everything with them, but without an educational change in the PA, I cannot be optimistic about progress in the process, and so we must prepare to manage the conflict.\"\nPA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, instead of talking to Israel, has continued to impose preconditions on talks, including a demand that Israel release terrorists who were jailed before 1993, freeze construction in Judea, Samaria and eastern Jerusalem and even present a map of the future Palestinian state before any negotiations take place.\nIn his remarks on Friday, Defense Minister Yaalon addressed the security situation in the Middle East.

The fulfilment of girls' right to education is first and foremost an obligation and moral imperative. There is also overwhelming evidence that girls' education, especially at the secondary level, is a powerful transformative force for societies and girls themselves: it is the one consistent positive determinant of practically every desired development outcome, from reductions in mortality and fertility, to poverty reduction and equitable growth, to social norm change and democratization.\nWhile there has been significant progress in improving girls' access to education over the last two decades, many girls, particularly the most marginalized, continue to be deprived of this basic right. Girls in many countries are still unable to attend school and complete their education due to safety-related, financial, institutional and cultural barriers. Even when girls are in school, perceived low returns from poor quality of education, low aspirations, or household chores and other responsibilities keep them from attending school or from achieving adequate learning outcomes. The transformative potential for girls and societies promised through girls' education is yet to be realized.\nRecognizing the need for fresh and creative perspectives to propel girls' education forward, the 2013 International Day of the Girl Child will address the importance of new technology, but also innovation in partnerships, policies, resource utilization, community mobilization, and most of all, the engagement of young people themselves."}
{"idx": "11550", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Several weeks ago a local television reporter asked me to comment on President Obama's recent decision to support gay marriage. In 2000, I was a media representative for Proposition 22 (the fore-runner of Proposition 8) here in California. Both propositions, which supported traditional marriage by voter mandate, were affirmed by California voters in 2000 and 2008 respectively. Proposition 8 won by a 53% plurality while Proposition 22, eight years earlier, won by more than 60% of the vote.\nThe television reporter who interviewed me was giddy about the sudden decision by the President to support gay marriage. She reminded me that his show of support was \"historic\" since Mr. Obama was (in her words) \"the first President\" to support gay marriage. The reporter really didn't want to hear my defense of traditional marriage and why Californians voted in favor of it on two elections.\nIt doesn't surprise me that most members of the mainstream media defend gay marriage and will continue to ignore the millions of us who support traditional marriage. It was certainly obvious during that week in May when the news broke about Obama's \"evolving\" decision. I did make a point to the reporter that in 30 states (either their voters or their state's legislature) have shown a majority support for traditional marriage. The local television station's news editors choose not to air those comments.\nWhat most members of the mainstream media simply ignore is the long term consequences of re-defining marriage. When you effectively change the parameters of an institution (namely traditional marriage that is historically defined as a union between one man and one woman) you are re-defining an institution that dates back more than 2,000 years. If the definition of marriage is changed, it will bring with it new problems. Already, a former President of the ACLU, has publicly said that if gay marriage is approved their legal organization will file legal papers in an effort to legalize polygamy.\nFull approval of gay marriage will also bring up other issues as well. In England, the age of consent has already been lowered from 14 to 12. Some expect it to drop further. In several Scandinavian countries (notably Sweden, Norway and Iceland) gay marriage has already been legalized. Sadly, in these countries, tradition marriage is now less popular with more couples electing to live together instead of being bound together in the commitment of marriage.\nTraditional marriage, in general terms, has always been the best support unit for raising children. Raising children with the role models of both mother and father has always been, in general terms, the ideal way to raise a family. Jesus himself defined marriage in Matthew 19:4-6. Yet the media remains giddy in their support for gay marriage and non-objective in their reporting of this \"evolving\" decision by Obama.\nI wish today's media and their so-called 'objective' reporters were more tolerant of the millions of us who support traditional marriage, believe in the Bible and know, beyond a doubt, that God can change anyone, as evidenced by the story of Michael Glatze who was once featured in 2005 in Time Magazine as an upcoming star in the gay community.\nRead Michael Glatze's remarkable story about how he came to faith in Christ in my newly released book, 16 Amazing Stories of Divine Intervention (www.16AmazingStories.com) ."}

{"idx": "11555", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In this series, we\u2019ve compared the response to global warming by the Chinese and U.S. governments.\nWith roughly one-fifth of the world\u2019s people living in China and its rapid industrialization in recent decades, both particulate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have become big problems. However, China, so woefully underdeveloped before its socialist revolution, is now far ahead of the U.S. in developing and carrying out long-range, comprehensive economic plans to shift its economy to other energy sources.\nHere we will look at what is happening to coal miners in both China and the U.S.\nOf the widely used fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 coal is the largest producer of carbon dioxide emissions. China has little oil and gas but a great deal of coal. Its air pollution problem has come largely from burning coal to make steel and generate electric power.\nArriving in Shanghai some 25 years ago, this writer was hit with a wave of nostalgia. It took a few minutes to figure out why. It was the smell of coal smoke, which had hung in the air all winter in the industrial city of Buffalo, N.Y., where I grew up.\nChina is still a developing country. But it has been building the infrastructure necessary to reduce consumption of fossil fuels while improving energy efficiency. This is not a wish list that could be shot down by future politicians, but part of a detailed plan for the country\u2019s development. Even with economic growth, its carbon footprint will peak somewhere between 2025 and 2030, as early as nine years from now. Its per capita CO2 emissions have always been much smaller than those in the U.S., and will go even lower.\nChina is the world\u2019s largest producer of steel and coal. But it is also the largest producer of solar and wind energy technology, and has forged ahead in hydroelectric and nuclear power. It has been shutting down thousands of coal mines, with plans to close many more.\nWhat will happen to coal miners?\nCoal mining is difficult and dangerous work. Chinese coal miners used to have the largest casualty rate in the world, with thousands dying in mine accidents every year. However, fatalities have been greatly reduced in recent years with enhanced safety measures, and will decline further as older mines are closed. The pace of shutting mines has also been accelerated by the slowdown in the capitalist world economy and a global glut in many commodities.\nMiners everywhere have been a militant, close-knit section of the working class. The coal miners\u2019 union in the U.S. was once the most feared by the bosses. China\u2019s miners are no exception.\nA plan to cut emissions for the health of the people and the future of the planet has to deal with what happens to the workers in these areas of the economy. In China\u2019s case, measures are being taken. The government is setting aside billions of dollars to relocate laid-off miners and their families.\nWhat\u2019s important here, from our point of view, is that China is committing very large sums to relocate the affected workers.\nNo one should think this plan to relocate miners into other jobs will happen automatically. A constant tug of war goes on in China between the growing capitalist class and the state, which arose out of China\u2019s great revolution made by the workers and peasants. Even in state-owned enterprises, officials can behave like bosses, as appears the case with the huge coal company Longmay, the product of a consolidation of many smaller state-owned mining companies.\nThousands of miners at Longmay\u2019s Sh"}

Consider this a cheat sheet to start the school year informed on all things school choice.\nJune marked 25 years since the nation's first charter school law was signed into existence in Minnesota.\nToday, 43 states plus the District of Columbia have charter schools enrolling over 2.5 million students\u2014or about 5 percent of the total K-12 public student population.\nAs part of Education Week's special report on the anniversary, we highlighted two charter schools, one led by teachers in St. Paul, Minn., and the other part of a large network in Los Angeles, to show how much the charter movement has changed over 25 years.\nComedian John Oliver made charter school fraud the focus of his show, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" on Aug. 21. Reaction to the episode was fairly predictable from the anti- and pro-charter camps. If you haven't seen the segment, yet, you can watch it here, and read some of the reaction to it.\nAlthough the John Oliver segment generated a lot of conversation on social media, arguably the biggest story of the summer was the NAACP and the Movement for Black Lives (a coalition of groups that includes Black Lives Matter) calling for a moratorium on new charter schools. The announcements exposed rifts in support among African Americans for charter schools\u2014and it's unclear what the long-term impact will be for charters.\nU.S. Education Secretary John B. King Jr. spoke to the National Charter Schools Conference in Nashville in June about discipline in charter schools. He called on charter leaders to use innovative approaches to rethink school discipline and cut down on student suspensions.\nFinally, in mid-July, Turkey's president survived an attempted military coup. And what, exactly, does this have to do with school choice? Well, it turns out there's a bizarre link between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the man he's accused of orchestrating the coup attempt, and a number of U.S.-based charter schools. You'll have to read it to believe it.\nTwo separate studies\u2014one on Florida charter school students and the other on Texas students\u2014found very different results on how attending a charter school affects a student's future income. The Florida study found that attending a charter school had a positive effect on students' future salaries. The Texas study found the opposite.\nStudents using vouchers to attend private schools in Ohio performed significantly worse on state tests than their peers who remained in public schools, according to a study commissioned by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute.\nThree prominent charter school advocacy organizations, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, and 50Can, came together to release a report calling for more regulation of full-time virtual charter schools.\nMeanwhile, another study on virtual charter schools in Ohio, also by Fordham, found fast growth but spotty performance in the sector.\nThe American Federation for Children, a pro-school choice advocacy organization, released its first ever state report cards on school choice. School choice programs in Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina came in first, second, and third, respectively. You can find"}

It is expected to be up and running at the capital's Central Market this autumn, followed by the New York University Abu Dhabi.\n\"The lack of recycling in the country is because every single system or process available here does not facilitate people's daily habits,\" said Mostafa Nassar, the business development manager of WMS Metal Industries, which specialises in building rubbish chutes for high-rise buildings.\nRecycling is not widely available on a door-to-door basis. At present you must drive to a waste collection point and these can be far away.\nThis deters all but diehard environmentalists, said Mr Nassar.\n\"You have to go out of your way to recycle here,\" he added.\nWith recycling rates below 10 per cent, the UAE is struggling to find the best way to deal with the ever-growing mountains of waste produced daily.\nWMS hopes to make recycling much easier for the public, and profitable for building owners.\nMr Nassar and his older brother, Mohamed Nassar, the managing partner of the company, have developed the waste-separator system over the last year.\nThe separator is essentially a large metal box or cylinder installed at the end of a rubbish chute. Inside this is a metal head.\n\"The head turns, directing the garbage to different trolleys at the end of the chute, depending on which button is pushed,\" said Mohamed.\nYesterday, he showcased the device - an orange metal box about two metres tall. Its shape can vary depending on the building, as can the number of waste categories on the electronic panel controlling it.\nLandlords can decide to separate only recyclable waste such as glass, plastic, metal and paper from general rubbish. Others may be more specific, separating different categories of recyclable materials.\n\"Up to six fractions, there is no problem,\" said Mohamed.\nLandlords can collect recyclable waste and sell it to processing firms. The company has calculated that a 20-storey building with eight apartments per floor can generate about Dh7,000 a month from recyclables. For landlords with many buildings, this could be a comfortable stream of revenue, the brothers said.\nThe system has panels on top of the waste trolleys to stop people stealing the recyclable material. The company claims that some building personnel in the UAE sell the materials for personal profit.\nThe device will also feature a tracking system so landlords can check if tenants have separated their waste conscientiously.\nLater this month, the company plans to file a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office.\nMohamed, an Egyptian who was raised in Abu Dhabi, said the issue of developing technology locally is important.\nIn 2009"}

That's why the Samsung Galaxy Camera could easily have been a nonsense concept\u2014two desirable things hurled together in hopes that the result will be a revolutionary hybrid, and not a catastrophe.\nBut forget all that, because it's neither. Instead, the Galaxy Camera is a deftly conceived prototype of what connected cameras should be.\nA $500 point-and-shoot camera with a 21x zoom that runs an Android Jelly Bean OS.

From the front, the lens and cozy grip could be the zoomy, wi-fi enabled Samsung WB850f. Sandwich them together, and you've got the Galaxy Camera.\nThe Galaxy Camera feels big for a point-and-shoot camera\u2014and big for a smartphone, too. The four-inch capacitvie touchscreen is a luxury on a camera, as is the instantaneous 4G connectivity. The Android OS is recognizable, and the apps work perfectly, whether shooting and sharing with Instagram or doing basic image editing in apps like Snapseed.\nWhen using a phone to take pictures, the ergonomics have always been a little off. The Galaxy Camera deals with this problem handily since, you know, it's an actual camera, complete with a shutter release and zoom on top. It operates like a mom-proof point-and-shoot in Auto and Smart modes; in Expert mode, a simple touch interface adjusts shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation, and ISO. It's intuitive, although, it would be nice if the pop-out menu for adjusting these settings didn't take up the whole screen.\nA full-featured camera that's connected to the Internet is a joy to use.\nApps like Instagram are not (and will never be) optimized to work with the Galaxy Camera's manual functionality and super long zoom.\nWell, the whole thing's pretty weird, really. Maybe the weirdest part is that we like it.\nA connected camera with Android OS makes sense. Camera makers have spent the last few years scrambling to compete with your smartphone camera's convenience by putting Wi-Fi into compact cameras. Until now, it's been poorly implemented. Using a general purpose GUI makes more sense than any of the proprietary solutions we've seen.\nSamsung's decision to go with such a long zoom is this camera's downfall. Yes, many people who shop for point-and-shoot cameras are very interested in zoom, but this makes the camera unwieldy. If, instead, Samsung had married the design of a GSIII with, say, the beautiful, slim design of its MV900F, the Galaxy Camera might've been an winner. People want their point-and-shoots tiny.\nGiven the Galaxy Camera's image quality, it's expensive for $500\u2014especially considering that you're also going to have to pay for a data plan.

That's because the snow pack slowly melts during the spring, recharging our waterways and reservoirs.\nAnd when you look at the numbers specifically for Bakersfield, we've now come to a water year total of 3.45\" thanks to this recovery in March, but that's still well below our average of 5.24\" where we would typically be by this point in the year. And so with that deficit, the drought continues.\nFind me on social media to let me know what you think about the drought, and to share your weather photos, videos and storm reports!"}

The Bible tells the story of the prodigal son who took his share of the estate and left home. He was welcomed back with open arms when he returned and celebrated by killing a fattened calf.\nBut what would have happened had the son been a daughter?\nIn many cultures, the daughter would not have been entitled to the estate in the first place.\nThere are many families in our communities who still believe that their daughters are not entitled to the father\u2019s wealth.\nIf there is a business, when the parents die, it automatically falls into the hands of the first born son. The house goes to the last born son, who will be the guardian of the family home.\nMojalefa is the name that is often given to these lucky inheriters, which means \u201cthe one who consumes the wealth\u201d.\nThink about it \u2013 they are not expected to create the wealth or to multiply it. They\u2019re supposed to eat it. Meanwhile, the daughters are left to the mercy of their husbands-to-be.\nThis kind of thinking, which might have been relevant in the times of our forefathers, no longer works in the modern economy where women have the same financial needs as men.\nOne of the main reasons the house falls into the hands of the last born son is that it is seen as some kind of insurance.\nIt is assumed that he will live the longest therefore should one of the daughters come back from her marriage, she will be able to come back \u201chome\u201d.\nPity the wife of the last born son who has to live with her sisters-in-law who\u2019ve come back home.\nFreedom, and the freedom to err and fail, should not be the exclusive preserve of men.\nThe daughters must be given the same opportunity too because it is only when we have the freedom to try out new things, fall, fail and learn that we can truly advance.\nProgress cannot be transplanted; it often demands pain and patience.\nThis means that in a family business, the daughters must be given the same amount of exposure and training.\nThey must be given the opportunity to make mistakes and, like the prodigal son, they must also be forgiven when they do silly things. But most important they must understand that the family believes in them and is willing to risk its future on them.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with groovin\u2019? Can\u2019t a girl have a little happy?\u201d asked Letta Mbulu in her wailing song, written by the now late Hugh Masekela.\nObviously I can never understand the pressures that a woman goes through. My knowledge and perhaps understanding of women is filled with boyhood gossip and grown-up-men prejudices of a bygone era, from which I cannot claim to be immune.\nMen my age are like foreign trees that have been transplanted into a new era. It is impossible to go back and we cannot change the new world to suit us, but the choice is ours to make. We can choose to wilt with bitterness and burden ourselves with insecurity or we can be the unsurpassed evergreens that make the young dream of the good old days.\nWe must open the world to the concept of the prodigal daughter who is loved with all her human flaws and frailties because no human being is complete without them.\nWe know that superman is true only in children\u2019s movies, so we must not expect our daughters to be wonder women."}

The details on the release are a little bit sketchy, but apparently 2K Games doesn't quite have as much faith in the Switch release of the game that Nintendo has in their own games.\nGame Informer is reporting that in Take-Two Interactive's financials, there's a mention that the digital version of NBA 2K18 for the Nintendo Switch will have launch parity with the Xbox One, PS4, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the basketball title next month on September 19th.\nThe major difference is that in addition to all of those systems having digital releases, they will also have physical releases of NBA 2K18 as well. The Nintendo Switch version's physical release is apparently scheduled to launch at some point in the \"Fall\" of 2017. So there will be a staggered physical release of the Switch's version.\nThere is no actual reason given by Take-Two, who is the parent company over 2K Games and 2K Sports, as to why there is a delay for the physical version of NBA 2K18 on the Switch, but some speculate that it may have to do with the size of the game fitting on the Switch's standard cart.\nThe cart size apparently goes up to a standard 32GB, which is less than half the size of NBA 2K17, which requires about 70GB of space. NBA 2K17 on PS4 and Xbox One before patches was just under 50GB. So even still the cart's size is way off from where it should be to contain a game like NBA 2K. Also keep in mind that it's unlikely that NBA 2K18 would be any smaller than NBA 2K17, so this would mean that 2K Sports would have to make a few key decisions when it comes to the physical packaging for the game.\nThe developers could either purchase higher capacity SD carts to store the game on, which is something that some studios would do for large-scale N64 games back in the day like Perfect Dark, WWF No Mercy or The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. However, there are questions as to whether or not 2K Sports and Take-Two feel as if the Switch version of NBA 2K18 would be worth the cost to invest in a larger cart.\nThere's also the possibility of storing the game on two separate carts; one cart for the single-player and one for the multiplayer. This was something that Microsoft had begun doing for Xbox 360 games, including titles like Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach. Games like Lost Odyssey, L.A. Noire and Mass Effect also came on multiple discs for the Xbox 360 due to the limited DVD9 storage capacity. Multiple discs were usually a last resort, though, since high-compression or hard-drive installation storage was always the preferred method, when applicable.\nIn the case of the Nintendo Switch, though, most games have either been a full cart release or a full digital release. There hasn't been a game yet that spans multiple carts or requires both cart and hard drive installation, since the logistics could create a rather confusing and disruptive user experience.\nSome people think that Take-Two and 2K will monitor the digital sales for NBA 2K18 first on the Nintendo Switch and if things go over well then a physical release will be made available for Nintendo's console."}

{"idx": "11571", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: It is a peculiarity of Evgeny Morozov, the foremost critic of our Twitterific age, that he could write 4,000 words in the New Yorker disemboweling the \"Maker\" movement without giving any indication whatsoever that he had ever talked to a single Maker or even so much as attended a Maker Faire.\nIt's peculiar, but not surprising. This is Morozov's self-admitted shtick. He grapples with the arguments that people make about things, instead of the people or the things themselves.\nFor a hands-on, do-it-yourself phenomenon like the Maker movement, the Morozov approach has some obvious drawbacks. It is one thing to claim, as Morozov does, that the Makers, like their forebears in the Arts and Crafts movement in the 19th century, will be \"doomed\" by their \"reluctance to talk about institutions and political change\" into \"channelling the spirit of labor reform into consumerism and D.I.Y. tinkering.\" Morozov might well be right in this. The Makers may not unleash the \"revolution\" that so many Maker evangelists claim is inevitable. And where there is hype, there is a myriad of opportunities for a man bearing a sharp lampoon.\nBut by confining himself to attacking the overweening Maker rhetoric, Morozov misses the fun. And by missing the fun, he misses the point.\nI went to a Maker Faire last year and delighted in rubbing elbows with an excited crowd -- diverse in age, class, race and gender -- that exulted in getting its hands dirty with everything from 3-D printers to Lego sets to knitting needles to giant Tesla coils. I did not need to parse the political implications of this happy hubbub for its implications for the future of the working class to understand that there was something obviously healthy about the energy bubbling over at the Faire. Compared to your typical amusement park the gathering was an anarchic, collectively engineered, upwelling of nerdy positivity. You didn't come to the Faire to be entertained. You came to entertain yourself. You came to learn and teach and play.\nIs a third industrial revolution in the offing? I don't know. But what is indisputable is that the tools of production are cheaper to obtain and easier to use than ever before -- and that development must have some sort of significance.\nMorozov does not directly deny that the means of production have been made more affordable. But he elides this absolutely crucial point by saying that the difficulties of gaining access to capital or expensive tools have been replaced by the difficulty of getting the attention necessary to make your Kickstarter dreams come true.\nIt is deeply befuddling to me that someone as smart as Morozov does not see that getting attention is a far, far easier thing to do in the age of digital networks than gaining access to capital or global production-and-supply networks. (And relatedly, the amount you need to raise today to get your idea out of your head and into production is much less than in our pre-3-D printing days.) Sure, some people are better than others at amassing followers and launching viral memes, but that does not mean that opportunity hasn't been democratized at all.\nA Maker Faire is exciting because you see all these neat things happening and you realize that you too can join the party.

How did such a practical thinker end up in the unpredictable world of music?\nAs a child, LeBleu took piano lessons and absolutely hated them. However, said she found joy in banging pots and pans around the house. Her parents took notice of this and eventually put LeBleu in drum lessons, which she said she loved. With her newfound joy of drumming, she joined a band as a drummer when she was in middle school.\nOver time, said she found herself harmonizing with the band despite her shyness of never wanting to \u201cbe in the front.\u201d Finding a new passion for singing, LeBleu notes that at the time, \u201csinging just made sense\u201d to her, prompting her to learn how to play the guitar by watching YouTube videos.\nLeBleu was encouraged to write songs throughout high school but viewed singing as just a fun hobby at that point. One night, she found herself performing covers for fun at a local show in Nashville, and a family friend in the audience recorded a video of her singing and sent it to a producer who was eager to record with LeBleu in a studio on Music Row.\nShe also said her actions were all based on response \u2014 a response she found slightly surprising.

Some of these substances are very dangerous and can and do lead to deaths.\n\"The way they're marketed and presented suggests to people that they are legal and safe. But sometimes they are not legal and they are certainly not safe.\"\nHe also said there were \"no simple solution\".\nMr Baker said the summit and a separate review would inform government policy, which was expected to be turned into legislation at some stage.\nThe government announced in January that the UK was opting out of planned European Commission rules on legal highs, arguing that they would make banning them slower and \"fetter\" efforts to deal with the problem."}

Although his Locker Board sales pitch was trumped by another team, he came home with a $1,000 consolation prize, a Motorola camera phone and newfound reinforcement that he is onto something good.\nOn the day after the show was taped, Carson was skating through Central Park when he rolled up to a man on a bench holding a big snake \u2014 maybe a python. The man wrapped it around Carson\u2019s neck. The boy got a little nervous, handing the man his Locker Board.

He experimented shaving them down into various shapes until he found one that proved surprisingly easy to ride. He could even do kick flips on them. With help from his mom, he launched a website. An Orange County Register article generated nationwide responses. Carson\u2019s YouTube videos sent the buzz worldwide.\nHe initially recycled skateboard decks to sell for $20, then began installing trucks and wheels on them so he could sell a complete Locker Board for $99. Biggest challenge was finding enough donated old decks to keep up with demand.\nCarson said he has sold about 125 Locker Boards so far, has shipped them nationwide, has donated 30 boards to charities and has netted a profit of $2,700.

{"idx": "11584", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: One of the more contentious debates in homeland security over the past several years has concerned fusion centers\u2014state and local run organizations dedicated to information sharing and analysis. These centers, which are funded by state and local governments but also receive federal support, have raised concerns with civil libertarians who argue that they threaten civil rights. These centers have also rankled good government advocates who question their effectiveness. But while fusion centers certainly saw their share of shortcomings in their early years, they\u2019ve made substantial progress since then and now play an important role in addressing problems identified after the 9/11 attacks.\nFusion centers began to emerge in the early 2000s when state and local governments sought to promote greater collaboration and information sharing in an effort to prevent future acts of terrorism. The number of fusion centers grew dramatically, from nine in 2003 to 78 by 2014. Most states have one, and a number have more than that. Massachusetts, for instance, has a statewide fusion center in Maynard and an urban center in Boston. California similarly has a statewide center, and it also has regional centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orange County, Sacramento, and San Diego.\nAt their core, the purpose of all fusion centers is largely similar: they receive, analyze, gather, and share information about threats. However, as state- and locally-run organizations, they often vary. For example, while some focus on terrorism, the responsibilities of others have evolved to include different threats, such as crime and natural disasters. Fusion centers typically issue bulletins and other analytical products, and they act as hubs, sending information up to the federal government and out to members of their community, as well as to other fusion centers around the country.\nThe federal government has given significant support to these efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, working with the Department of Justice, has developed guidelines for the centers that address performance, privacy, governance, and other areas. Fusion centers can receive funding through grant programs that FEMA administers, but the funding must be used to improve shortcomings in meeting these standards. The federal government also provides training and deploys personnel to the centers to play a variety of supporting roles. In fact, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found nearly 300 representatives from agencies\u2014such as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, TSA, the FBI, and the DEA, among others\u2014at fusion centers around the country in 2013.\nWhile their benefits are obvious, fusion centers have also drawn a fair amount of criticism\u2014some of it warranted, some less so. One of the most significant critiques came from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which issued a scathing report in 2012. (Note: While I didn\u2019t work for the subcommittee that produced this report, I did work for the full committee when the report was issued and advised the chairman on the subject.) It argued that fusion centers provided low-quality intelligence to the federal government and were not contributing in a meaningful way to counterterrorism efforts. The report also raised concerns that the centers were monitoring lawful political and religious activities, charges that have been echoed by the ACLU and NYU\u2019s Brennan Center. Moreover, it found that FEMA was doing a poor job tracking the funding it awarded.\nThere was truth to some of these claims. FEMA has long had problems with grant monitoring, for example, although this is an issue that extends beyond fusion centers. But in evaluating their effectiveness, the report limited its analysis to the information fusion centers sent up to the federal government and"}

Jerry Brown has $22 million in the bank and a 21-point lead in the polls, but as he seeks a historic fourth term, he's conducting one of the most unusual re-election campaigns ever witnessed by state voters - one in which he hasn't starred in a single TV or radio spot, campaign mailer, or Web video.\nWith less than three weeks to go before Californians can cast ballots, Brown's campaign spokesman said Tuesday that the governor doesn't even plan to be the star of his own appeals to voters this year. Instead, he'll focus on urging them to pass a pair of bond measures.\nPropositions 1 and 2 - a $7 billion water-infrastructure bond and mandatory rainy-day budget reserve, respectively - are \"a critical part of his agenda to further stabilize California's economy,\" spokesman Dan Newman said. \"They're central to his governing philosophy - putting money aside in good times to avoid harsh cuts during downturns, and storing water for when it's needed most.\"\nBrown is expected to take that message to voters in person and possibly on the airwaves.\nHis confident, no-frills strategy is a far cry from raucous gubernatorial contests of the recent past that have been awash in money and mudslinging.\nIn 2010, California voters were subjected to a $250 million slugfest between Brown and billionaire former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who spent more than $140 million of her own money in losing.\nIn 2002, Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Bill Simon spent a then-unheard-of $100 million in a battle Davis ultimately won, only to be recalled a year later.\nThis year, Brown has taken an entirely new tack in his fight against Republican candidate Neel Kashkari, a former U.S. Treasury official who has used attention-getting gimmicks like posing as a jobless itinerant in Fresno to raise his profile rather than spending money he doesn't have.\nBrown's strategy is \"a non-campaign, which makes it a very smart campaign,\" said Jessica Levinson, who teaches political ethics as a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\nThe 76-year-old Brown, who first held statewide office in 1971, \"doesn't need to introduce himself\" to voters, Levinson said. \"He has better name recognition than anyone else in the state. His platform is totally known. He's been governing since the Earth cooled.\"\nAnd clearly, she said, \"he's running against someone people don't even know.\"\nA USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released this week showed the efforts have paid off: The governor's approval rating is at 58 percent, the highest since he took office in 2011, while Kashkari - who has spent more than $2 million of his own money on the race - is still a mystery to more than 75 percent of voters.\nAmong likely voters, Brown leads Kashkari by a commanding 57 to 36 percent, the poll showed.\nBrown's non-campaign strategy was evident Friday at the Presidio in San Francisco, where he swore in 1,000 potential young voters, all volunteers in the AmeriCorps service program.\nThe governor never even hinted he was running for re-election.

Another would require agency leaders to explore the potential for reciprocity, which would allow employees to transfer clearances if they move organizations.\nCurrent provisions in the bill would also increase transparency into the actions different groups are taking to accelerate the clearance process.\nThe Performance Accountability Council, the body that oversees governmentwide vetting, would be required to submit a plan for reducing the backlog to 500,000 by the end of the year and 200,000 by the end of 2019.\nIn 2017, a background check for secret clearance took on average 134 days to complete, roughly triple the expected timeline, while investigations for top-secret clearance lasted some 331 days, more than quadruple the expected timeline, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The current bill would set new timeliness goals at 30 days for secret clearances and 90 days for top secret clearances.\nAgency leaders and lawmakers have long struggled to rein in the constantly expanding backlog of federal employees, applicants and contractors awaiting background checks for government jobs. In January, the Government Accountability Office added the clearance system to its high-risk list, and officials are reconsidering which agency should run the process in the first place."}

A few days later, on July 1, Conway joined Trump\u2019s campaign as an adviser.\n\"There was no overlap for me, even though that would have been legally permitted,\" Conway said of her work for the PAC and the campaign.\nBut the PAC kept paying The Polling Company, listing payments of $81,000 on June"}

The inspectors are not expected to assign blame.\nA convoy of U.N. vehicles with chemical weapons experts on board head out on Friday to do more work as the investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in near Damascus.\nAfter the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack near Damascus that reportedly killed more than 1,000 people and has been blamed on Bashar Assad's regime, the Syrian president's ambassador to the U.N. claimed that opposition forces had used such weapons at least three times in the days immediately after.\n\"Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said he had requested of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the team of experts currently in Damascus investigating an alleged use of chemical weapons last week also investigate ... other attacks.\nThe attacks took place on August 22, 24 and 25 in Jobar, Sahnaya, and al-Bahariya, Jaafari told journalists Wednesday. The 'militants' used toxic chemical gas against the Syrian army, the diplomat said.\"\n\"The United Nations mission investigating alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria on Friday continued working on a comprehensive report that it hopes will be ready by late October. The report is based on a number of allegations presented to the United Nations Secretary-General, of which seven have been found to warrant investigation according to the UN Secretary-General's Mechanism for investigation of alleged use of chemical and biological weapons.\n\"Ashrafiah Sahnaya, 25 August 2013.\"\nAs you see, the three incidents that Ambassador Jaafari spoke about are among those being looked at.\nThe investigators, as they did when reporting about the Aug. 21 attack, are expected to focus on whether chemical weapons were used, not on which side was responsible.\nThe regime and spokesman for the rebels have consistently blamed each other when there are allegations of chemical weapons use. Regarding the Aug. 21 incident in particular, the U.S. and its allies have said the intelligence pointing at Assad's regime is overwhelming.\nMeanwhile, as we reported Thursday, Russia, the U.S. and the other members of the U.N.

Police recovered two semi-automatic weapons, two shotguns and a lever-action firearm, which the attacker could own legally because he had a category-A gun license.\nNew Zealand\u2019s gun ownership rate has risen in the past decade to become one of the highest in the world, yet its homicide rate remains well below global norms as many of those weapons belong to hunters and farmers.

In the decade to 2015, there were only two years in which the number of such homicides reached 10 or more. The nation\u2019s overall homicide rate of 1.2 per 100,000 people is well below the global rate of 6.4, according to a WHO report from 2015.\nGun licenses can be obtained starting at 16 years of age.

There are restrictions on semi-automatic guns, and the licenses of gun dealers must be renewed annually.\nA parliamentary inquiry released in April 2017 urged tighter gun registrations, more controls on gun dealers and owners, and the creation of a new category of restricted semi-automatic weapons.

An agreement is expected to be signed by the end of 2008, the same person said.\nThe deal envisages a complete overhaul of MTN\u2019s information technology (IT) systems in three phases: business process re-engineering, systems transformation and IT operations. IBM, the world\u2019s biggest IT company, will recommend more efficient processes, integrate stand-alone technologies with the main MTN system, and finally take over the African phone firm\u2019s entire IT operations under the proposed deal.\nFor MTN, the tie-up could result in cost savings, help it manage customer churn, add new subscribers and get to the market with new services faster than its competitors, analysts say.\n\u201cA simple billing application could take up an entire IT department (in a phone firm).

{"idx": "11620", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Merck has been taking heat for the price it paid for Idenix -- Here's why it actually isn't as crazy as it sounds.\nRecently, the pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) has been receiving a bit of heat from commentators who believe that the company offered way too much money for the hepatitis c therapeutics developer Idenix Pharmaceuticals (UNKNOWN:IDIX.DL) last week. Although the $3.85 billion acquisition gives Merck full rights to a promising mid-stage hepatitis c drug called samatasvir, many people believe that Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) blockbuster hep c drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) may deplete most of the market by the time Merck's combo (including samatasvir) can apply for FDA approval.\nIf we are limiting our discussion to the US hep c patient population, I would fully agree that Merck made an unfavorable bet with its bid for Idenix. However, many people seem to miss the fact that the US only has about 2% of the world's hep c patients. Even if Gilead utterly dominates the US market for hep c in the next 3-4 years, Merck can target well over 100 million non-US patients who have few (if any) options for elimination of the virus.\nOutside the US, Merck wouldn't be able to match the prices that Gilead currently charges for a 12-week regimen of Sovaldi in the United States ($84,000). However, Merck could later decide to partner with local distributors who would commercialize Merck's drug in exchange for tiered royalty payments. These are often structured as percentage-based payments that offer passive income to the parent company based on the drug's performance.\nAlthough the income would take much longer to materialize, it would come at little to no cost to Merck (aside from the developmental and acquisition expenses it is already incurring). This would make it commercially viable for Merck to target the huge hep c populations in developing countries without issues of scalability or large, upfront investments.\nI think Merck realizes that it cannot launch a hep c drug that will take off sprinting like Sovaldi did (with $2.3 billion sold in its first full quarter on the market), but there are many dollars waiting to be picked up by reasonably priced hep c products that work better than generic antivirals. On the global scale, hepatitis c is a numbers game that cannot be won by overpriced drugs. Even if Gilead's Sovaldi fully saturates US market by the time Merck launches a competitor, it only means that the low-hanging fruit are gone.\nIt's also worth noting that Gilead's Sovaldi would not always erase market share for other hep c therapies. Because antiviral therapies often have synergistic effects, we could eventually see Sovaldi and Merck's drugs used in combination (and in fact, Merck is already testing a three-drug combo including Sovaldi in the hope of finding a faster-acting cure for hepatitis c). Drug layering is a growing trend in medicine, and it gives latecomer cocktails like Merck's a fighting chance against drugs that have already saturated the market years after launch.\nHaving said this, it should be stated that the Idenix acquisition was an aggressive move that could easily end up backfiring should"}

However, an integrated developer provides all these services under one tender by optimising cost.\nWhile the government has allowed marketing freedom for gas produced from CBM blocks unlike regulated price offered for gas produced from conventional fields, a cost of $8.77 per mmBtu is way more compared with prices that other CBM blocks have fetched. While it is reported that ONGC has struck deals to sell gas from its other three blocks at $5.56-6.17 per mmBtu, Reliance Industires\u2019 Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh sells gas for more than $7.15 per mmBtu, the highest till date.\nNevertheless, these rates are much more than $3.06 per mmBtu price set by the government for majority of the domestically produced conventional natural gas. ONGC has already invited expression of interest for the integrated development of the Raniganj block from interested parties.\nONGC\u2019s integrated development plan follows Vedanta\u2019s similar tender for its Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields in the prolific Barmer fields which has reportedly brought down the cost to around 70%. The source added that ONGC also wants one operator to execute the field development plan.\nThe high cost from the Raniganj block is because of the production prospects. For instance, while the Raniganj block has reserve 7 billion cubic metre (BCM) requiring Rs 2,123 crore for development, the Bokaro block has 30 BCM of gas and will require `2,783 crore for development.\nCBM is a generic term used for gas that is found in adsorbed state in coal. The CBM policy was first formulated in 1997, and later amended in 2013. The coal ministry, along with the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, had identified 26,000 square kilometre of coal basinal areas for CBM exploration having reserves of around 2,600 BCM, out of which 33 CBM blocks having an area of 16,000 square kilometre have already been awarded.\nHowever, only 2,575 square kilometre till date have been put to production having 280 BCM of reserves."}

It's thicker than the Nook and has a lower screen resolution.\nOn the other hand, it's a fraction of the price and provides most of the same functions. In addition to displaying e-books in a variety of formats (more on that in a minute), it lets you listen to music and watch videos (in a lot more formats than the Nook can).\nIn addition to PDF, PRC, Mobi, TXT, and FB2 formats, the Libre supports EPUB--which, I would argue, is the single most important consideration when shopping for an e-reader. That's because most libraries use EPUB for the free books they loan out. I recently read \"The Help\" (and loved it, by the way--laugh all you want), but instead of paying $12.99, I checked out the EPUB edition from my library.\nCNET hasn't reviewed the Libre Color, and the user reviews I've seen elsewhere (like on Amazon) have been mixed.

They\u2019re famous for removing the sick and weak, and their scraps are an essential food source for scavengers. Across the Caribbean, overexploitation has led to growing concern for shark population health. Despite their popularity, the science on shark ecology and behavior is still developing, and many things remain up for debate or poorly understood.\n\u201cSharks can be controversial \u2013 even within the scientific community. It\u2019s incredible, really,\u201d says Dr. Austin Gallagher, Chief Scientist of the conservation NGO Beneath the Waves. \u201cToday, everyone has a chance to produce ground-breaking work on sharks that is timely, relevant, and impactful. I don\u2019t know many other spaces like this. It\u2019s pretty exciting,\u201d he adds.\nBeneath the Waves is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the conservation and scientific knowledge of sharks through cutting-edge science and collaboration. A big part of their focus is on the Caribbean, where today sharks are generally rare visitors to the reefs due to overfishing.\nResearchers doing a work up on a shark.\nHow these Bahamian sharks move in and out of the Bahamian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is also, largely, a mystery. As many shark populations worldwide face increasing pressure from overfishing and habitat destruction, the researchers from Beneath the Waves are studying to see if shark sanctuaries are actually good for sharks or not. Knowing where they go and why allows scientists to examine how useful the national shark sanctuary is in protecting these shark populations.\nIf a region is designated as a \u201csanctuary,\u201d it prohibits the commercial fishing of all sharks, prohibits the retention of sharks caught as bycatch, as well as the possession, trade, and sale of sharks and shark products within that country\u2019s EEZ. Sanctuaries have become a popular conservation tool throughout the Caribbean and Pacific, however, some question their efficacy, largely due to the lack of scientific evidence for how sharks and humans use them throughout the year.\nIn 2018, Beneath the Waves launched one of the first long-term studies focused on understanding the benefits of sanctuaries to sharks, focusing on using the Bahamas shark sanctuary as a model. Beneath the Waves is evaluating the movements of various species of sharks in the Bahamas by tagging sharks with internal acoustic transmitters and monitoring their habitat use throughout the year with fixed receiver stations. They are focusing primarily on Caribbean reef sharks, due to their abundance, economic importance, and similarities to reef sharks in other parts of the world. Other species they will be tagging include nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), tigers (Galeocerdo cuvier), bulls (Carcharhinus leucas), and hammerheads (Sphyrna species).\n\u201cMarine protected areas give us the opportunity to experience the ocean in its natural state,\u201d says Rose Mann, Board Member for Beneath the Waves. \u201cThere are few examples where we can see sharks living without interference or disturbance, so we want to study this management tool in real time, and"}

The Los Pasos project is a highly prospective polymetallic VMS belt that correlates with similar Cretaceous volcanic arc rocks in the Dominican Republic, which host the Pueblo Viejo, Cerro de Maim\u00f3n and other large gold and silver enriched VMS deposits. Three past producing mines are located on the Los Pasos concession as are multiple clusters of underexplored targets.\nA Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by RPA for two of three past producing mines that occur on the Los Pasos property. RPA estimated the Mineral Resources for the Antonio and San Fernando deposits using drill hole data. The Mineral Resource estimate is summarized in Table 1 below. A Technical Report in compliance with National Instrument NI-43-101 will be filed on SEDAR within 45 days of this release.\n1. CIM 2014 Definition Standards were followed for Mineral Resources.\n2. Mineral Resources are reported at a Net Smelter Return (NSR) cut-off value of US$70/t for underground and US$25/t for open pit.\n3. Mineral Resources are estimated using a long-term copper price of US$3.50 per pound, zinc price of US$1.15 per pound, and silver price of US$21 per ounce.\n4. Metallurgical recovery factors assumed were 91% Cu, 73% Zn, and 68% Ag.\n5. Common industry values for smelter terms were assumed.\n6. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n7. Bulk density of 3.8 t/m3 was used at Antonio and 3.1 t/m3 at San Fernando.\n8. A minimum thickness of approximately two metres was used.\n9. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\nThe current Mineral Resource estimate was done by block modeling techniques, using a minimum horizontal width of approximately two metres and a cut-off value based on a NSR basis, because of the polymetallic nature of the mineralization. The Mineral Resource estimate is based on both open pit and underground potential mining scenarios using a US$70/t NSR cut-off value for underground and US$25/t NSR cut-off value for open pit. Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves were followed for Mineral Resources. All Mineral Resources are classified as Inferred.\nThe Mineral Resource estimate for the San Fernando deposit is based on a potential underground mining scenario. Inferred Mineral Resources reported at a US$70/t NSR cut-off value are estimated to total 0.24 million tonnes at 2.04% Cu, 3.60% Zn, and 28.7 g/t Ag.

She told the publication, \"The couch was on fire, there were sweaty, shirtless people dancing. That's why I do what I do: I like seeing people lose their s---- and not give a f---- about what other people think of them.\"\nWhen it comes to getting the party started, it seems like Kesha gravitates to some of classic rock's most iconic songs.

Purnendu Maji and Srinivas Bhogle help us figure it out.\nOne would expect expensive players to perform better. Does that really happen?\nGenerally speaking, yes. In fact very much so (see the strong correlation between overall player rank and the 'high cost' player rank in the table below).\nof players who cost little, but contribute a lot. This year's surprises have been Ajinkya Rahane and Mandeep Singh. Last year we had Paul Valthaty among others.\nand Faf du Plessis, James Franklin, Marlon Samuels and Kevon Cooper. All of them have been prize catches. Or think of Shane Watson and Shaun Marsh in IPL1.\nIn the tables below we define players paid Rs 1 crore or less ($200,000 or less) as 'low cost'. It is ironic that the same $200,000 would be considered 'very expensive' in the Oz Big Bash!\nAnd what is the comparison between Indian and foreign players? One would normally expect more valuable performances from Indian players than foreign players because of the forced 7:4 ratio.\nIt turns out that, while Indian and foreign players generally have matching performance, foreign players have a very slight edge, at least in IPL5. The tables below list the 25 most valuable Indian and foreign players separately. While the Indian players' MVPI ranges from 615 to 221, for foreign players the MVPI ranges from 619 to 231.\nThe 25th most valuable player in the 'foreign' list, would've bagged the 22nd place in the 'Indian' list. Or put another way the 25th most valuable foreign player is 46th on the overall list, while the 25th most valuable Indian player is 53rd in the overall list.\nFinally we make a comparison based on age.\nDo older players perform better on the average, or younger players? To keep things simple, we've defined 'old' as a player who is more than 30 years old. So Sehwag (33) is 'old', but Gambhir (30) is 'young'.\nThe tables below confirm that 'young' players easily outperform their older rivals on the cricket field. Daniel Vettori who is 25th on the 'old' players' list is 76th in the overall list. In fact, apart from Gayle and Sehwag no 'old' player makes it even to the top 10 list!\nWe must end this analysis by pointing out that there are many other ways to make these comparisons. We could, for example, have compared the average MVPI between two categories.\nBut even a simple ranking rule provides reasonable answers: that the more expensive player indeed provides greater value, that foreign players are marginally outperforming Indian players and that young players easily outperform older players in the IPL."}

The single-camera White Van Man is a blue collar ensemble based on the British format and centers on a man (Bornheimer) who is forced to put his dreams on hold in order to take over the family handyman business from his father. The series takes its name from the UK phrase that describes the stereotype for drivers of light commercial vehicles, often self-employed or owning small businesses such as handyman services. The ABC Studios-produced adaptation of the Adrian Poynton-created original was written by Bobby Bowman who executive produces with Mark Gordon and Andrea Shay.\nEarlier this season, Bornheimer, along with his brother Ryan, sold a comedy pitch to ABC with Kyle attached to star and produce.

But if Australia beat Sri Lanka in the last league tie of the CB Series in Melbourne on Friday, it will be India who will face the hosts in the best-of-three finals.\nVictory with a bonus was the only way for India to stay alive and it didn\u2019t come as a surprise when skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni put Sri Lanka in to bat. However, once Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara had feasted on the Indian attack, it looked near-impossible that they would knock off the required 321 runs in 40 overs to earn the bonus point.\nA quickfire opening stand was imperative and Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar did just that.\nBy the time Sehwag holed out to Dilshan at mid-on in the seventh over, the total was already 54 runs. Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir maintained the momentum until Tendulkar was trapped plumb in front trying to flick a Lasith Malinga yorker.\nInstead of going for the kill by persisting with Malinga, who had changed ends after being taken for runs in his first three overs, skipper Mahela Jayawardene chose to hold him back for the late burst.

Wednesday\u2019s decision smoothens the way for new entrants to start retail operations in the country.\nThe cabinet eased the local sourcing rule for foreign single-brand retailers; such entities are not required to meet the 30% target for local sourcing by their Indian units for five years if they are already doing so for their global operations, it said. So far they have been required to source locally 30% of the value of goods purchased for their Indian business initially as an average of five years; later they were required to meet the requirement on a yearly basis.\nIKEA, which has ambitious business plans for India, and H&M are among the potential beneficiaries of the new sourcing norms.\nThe government did not define the \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 and \u2018cutting-edge technology\u2019 it has previously said would be required of high-tech companies to open single-brand stores.

The government has rejected the application of Apple Inc. to open stores under that provision, holding that its technology is not \u2018cutting edge\u2019.\nIn August, the government set up a committee under department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) secretary Ramesh Abhishek to clearly define these two terms. The recommendations of the committee have not been made public yet.\nRetail experts hold that while the FDI relaxation will remove entry barriers for foreign single brand retail companies altogether, more important concerns regarding local sourcing and FDI in multi-brand retail remain.\n\u201cIt (the relaxation) is not a very big deal because the problem in single brand retail has not been with the clearance process but with the sourcing norms,\" said Arvind Singhal, chairman at consulting firm Technopak Advisors Pvt.

I recently met a judge from a rural county in the southeast. Faced each day with the wreckage of lives torn apart by drugs, she told me that she hardly practices law anymore. Instead, she is running a social service agency, getting victims of addiction back on their feet.\nWhile no corner of our country has gone untouched by this crisis, the recent surge in drug use has hit rural America particularly hard, impacting quality of life and economic opportunity in small towns from Alaska to Maine.\nBetween 1999 and 2015, drug overdose deaths in rural counties jumped by 325 percent as compared to 198 percent in metropolitan areas. Last fall, Harvard University released a survey of rural Americans who identified drug addiction as the biggest challenge facing their community. And, in 2017, two leading farm groups, the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union, conducted a survey that found nearly 50 percent of rural Americans and 74 percent of farmers have been directly impacted by opioid misuse.\nTo fight back against the scourge of addiction, the Trump administration has deployed an all-hands-on-deck approach to make critical resources available to our local communities. A year ago, President Trump launched an Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand. As just one example since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) partnered with local leaders to build infrastructure for prevention, treatment and recovery in rural America, facilitate partnerships and drive innovation in rural communities on the front lines of this battle. Through its Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant program, USDA helped rural leaders in 68 communities access treatment, counseling services and prevention education through remote connections in 33 states.\nIn Kentucky, these awards included projects like funding the Grace Community Health Center to provide mental health and substance-abuse treatment services in nine communities. Working with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), USDA also compiled a federal rural resource guide to help rural leaders navigate the various federal programs available to empower locally led responses to address the opioid crisis in small towns. And, partnering with Isaiah House, a faith-based organization in south central Kentucky, USDA launched an innovative agreement to convert foreclosed homes into transitional housing for people in drug treatment and recovery. For Rockcastle and Hart County, two eastern Kentucky counties that have been deeply impacted by drug addiction, this means that community leaders have a new and powerful tool to harness in defeating this crisis.\nUnder the leadership of President Trump and in partnership with State leaders, this administration is stepping up to do even more to address the significant needs of rural communities in this crisis. Access to treatment services, broadband connectivity to enable telemedicine and transportation resources are critical challenges we are meeting head on.\nThe addiction crisis plaguing our country, including rural Kentucky, is more complex and demanding than ever before.

During the hearing, new CPRA executive director Bren Haase said the list of projects includes continued construction of a major restoration project in Plaquemines Parish.\n\u201cI think the biggest marsh and ridge restoration project that the state\u2019s ever undertaken is located in Plaquemines Parish, the Spanish Pass project,\u201d Haase said.\nThe state will spend $1.9 million on the project on the west side of the Mississippi River in the Barataria Basin in 2020, but has plans to spend $60 million on construction in fiscal year 2021 and another $53.6 million the year after, with most of the money coming from the BP oil spill Natural Resource Damage Assessment process.\nWetlands scientist has been with the agency since it was created in 2005, oversaw latest coastal master plan update.\nIn addition to the natural resource benefits, the elevation of the ridge should also help block hurricane storm surges threatening nearby populated areas.\nThe project also will make use of sediment dredged from the Mississippi River by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of operations to maintain its navigation channel.\nHaase said the 2020 budget also includes money to study the potential of using pipelines to move sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild wetlands on the river\u2019s east side. Similar pipeline projects have been completed on the west side of the river during the past few years.\nAbout $505 million of the annual plan\u2019s total would be spent on construction, and another $141 million on engineering and design. Officials predict that the fiscal year 2021 annual plan will include $738 million in spending, and that fiscal year 2022 will see expenditures of $938 million.\nFuture years could average near $1 billion, thanks to a steady stream of money for restoration projects from fines and payments related to the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil spill that are being paid to the state over 15 years; and the state\u2019s share of federal offshore oil revenue from the Gulf of Mexico that will slowly increase from about $70 million this year to as much as $140 million when production of oil from new wells increases.\nWhile the annual plan \u2013 and the multi-year updates of the master plan \u2013 have all been approved unanimously by the Legislature since 2007, the budget does include several controversial projects.\nAt the top of the list are the proposed Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton sediment diversions that would funnel sediment and freshwater from the Mississippi River during high-river periods into wetlands on the west and east banks.\nState officials contend the diversions will both build new wetlands by filling areas of open water and nourish existing wetlands by adding sediment to them.\nFishers contend the freshwater from the diversions will"}

As well as the violence, refugees cite food insecurity due to failed crops as a reason for their flight.\nLast month, UNHCR reported that fighting in Western Equatoria, which until then had been spared much of the violence that has hit other parts of the country, had displaced over 4,000 people into a remote region of north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nAs of 6 January, registered new arrivals, most in the Dungu area, had risen to 6,181, some 4,164 of them South Sudan nationals and 2,017 Congolese, who had been living as refugees in South Sudan.

Trump hosted them at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and pledged U.S. investment in their countries.\nThe new sanctions, issued in response to the kidnapping, specifically target Venezuela\u2019s national development bank, BANDES, and four additional subsidiaries that BANDES owns or controls.\n\u201cThe regime\u2019s continued use of kidnapping, torture and murder of Venezuelan citizens will not be tolerated by the U.S. or the international coalition\u201d that is united behind Juan Guaido, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. He was referring to the opposition leader recognized by more than 50 countries as the legitimate interim leader following a flawed ballot that resulted in Maduro\u2019s re-election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not bluffing when we told Maduro not to do stuff like this (the kidnapping),\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser told Univision News in an interview aired Friday.\nThe U.S. has already sanctioned scores of top Venezuelan officials and has blocked U.S. banks from doing business with that country, imposing a financial strangle-hold on the cash-strapped nation. The sanctions announced Friday also came as members of Congress from both parties condemned Marrero\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cThe international community is closely watching Maduro\u2019s actions and will respond accordingly to any that threaten the safety of the opposition and Interim President Juan Guaid\u00f3,\u201d said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas.\nTrump hosted the leaders of Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Republic and St. Lucia to show his support for Caribbean countries that back democratic transition in Venezuela. The five have either denounced Maduro or joined more than 50 countries in recognizing Juan Guaido as the rightful interim leader of the nation.\nJamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness said that at their meeting with Trump he learned that a representative from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government agency that helps American businesses invest in emerging markets, would be visiting the region and the five countries.\nThe Trump administration considers Maduro\u2019s government a dictatorship and says he was re-elected in an illegitimate election. The U.S. has sanctioned scores of top Venezuelan officials and has blocked U.S. banks from doing business with Venezuela, putting a financial stranglehold on the cash-strapped country. The country is in an economic meltdown and millions of Venezuelans have fled.\nSt. Lucia Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet said it\u2019s been since the Reagan administration that the U.S. has taken an interest in the Caribbean and acknowledged that Trump\u2019s invitation was likely due to their support of the U.S. stance against Venezuela at the Organization of American States.\nHe also acknowledged that not all countries in the region agree with the U.S. call for Maduro\u2019s ouster."}

In addition to the suspension and the lost first-round pick, the Patriots will also lose a fourth-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft and will be fined $1 million.\nThe news comes one week after the league issued its report on the controversy, in which two Patriots staffers are alleged to have underinflated game balls during last year\u2019s AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. The report, conducted by attorney Ted Wells, said that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the two employees tampered with footballs before that game and \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that Brady knew about it.\nBrady, who has built up one of the greatest resumes in the history of the sport with two league MVP awards and three Super Bowl MVP awards, has said in the past that he prefers balls that are \u201cdeflated.\u201d Deflating the air out of balls can help a quarterback\u2019s grip, but the league mandates that game balls be inflated between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch.\nThe balls used by the Patriots in the first half of the Colts game were found to be inflated below that level and a series of text messages by the two Patriots employees alleged to have organized the team\u2019s deflations indicated that they did it regularly and that Brady knew about it.\nIn 2006, Brady and Peyton Manning lobbied the league to change its rules to allow road teams to handle the footballs they used on offense. Before it was the home team that managed the balls for both sides.\nBoston Globe writer Ben Violin reported that longtime Patriots employees and alleged game ball fixers Jim McNally and John Jastremski have been suspended indefinitely and banned from handling game balls.\nPatriots backup Jimmy Garoppolo is expected to start the first four games of the year against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Buffalo Bills, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Dallas Cowboys."}

{"idx": "11691", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Rupert Goodwins: Intel's new BIOS replacement promises to liberate the industry from the limits of the old way - but will it remove old freedoms at the same time?\nReporting from the Intel Developer Forum last month, I covered an Intel initiative called the Extensible Firmware Interface, or EFI. It was, I thought, a solid but unexciting story: Intel plans to popularise a tiny operating system designed to replace the PC's BIOS. And why not? The BIOS -- basic input output system -- is a real reptilian hindbrain hangover from the 1981 birth of the PC. It's a chunk of hand-crafted assembly language programming, the sort that looks like it's been encrypted even when it hasn't. Keeping it up to date in the modern world has been like trying to teach a crocodile to tango. Intel's proposal is focused, clever and apposite.\nWhat the BIOS does is absolutely vital to modern computing: it holds the instructions that the computer runs first thing in the morning. It has the low-level magic that ensures that the computer's memory controller, hard disk interface, video card and so on all turn on properly: it wakes up the motherboard's workforce and gets them ready for the operating system. This has to work with whichever of a zillion different expansion options are ready -- many with their own bits of BIOS -- and it has to be uncommonly reliable. As there's no operating system loaded when the BIOS runs, and as it has to live in the restricted confines of a flash memory chip, it has to be minuscule and very highly optimised -- hence the handwritten assembler. You can't do that sort of thing in C or Java.\nEFI updates the plot. Instead of the BIOS, there's a very small -- tiny enough to live on a chip -- operating system. It knows just enough to load more of itself from disk, talk over the network and handle basic files. It also has a small interpreter that can run programs originally written in C -- or whatever -- and compiled to byte code, like Java. People who need to write BIOS-type programs can now write proper software, turn them into byte code and know that they'll run on any EFI system. Intel says that this could mean the end of people having to write separate low-level drivers to make their expansion cards run in different classes of system, and the start of lots of really useful little utilities to help debug problems with hardware on PCs. All very welcome -- but there's another side.\nThe original BIOS defined the dynamics of the whole early PC industry. IBM was very open about its original PC -- it published all the circuit diagrams and the complete listing of the BIOS in the famous IBM PC Technical Reference Manual. This was unheard of at the time: the purple-covered ringbound book, known universally as the TechRef, was a guarantee that if you were building add-ons or writing software, you knew exactly what you were aiming for. You could examine every detail of the PC, and the TechRef soon became holy writ in R&D labs around the world.\nBut woe betide you if you tried to copy any of it. IBM was open in publishing the details under the hood because it had great faith in its army of intellectual property lawyers. Hence the flood of almost-compatible computers that came with their own versions of MS-DOS: without the same BIOS, they couldn't run real IBM compatible software. And as many people wrote software that demanded the original IBM BIOS and other"}

It's not easy to cover bills and expenses as you build your startup to success. And startups are rarely profitable from the get-go.\nAside from providing cash flow to cover your expenses, consulting is an opportunity to make connections and establish credibility in the same industry as your startup. Use your expertise as a consultant to network, build your client base and gain authority. All will be beneficial to building out your startup once you're ready to launch.\nFor example, look at Mike McDerment, founder of invoicing software FreshBooks. He worked as a full-time consultant as he built his software company on the side. Once FreshBooks became cash flow positive, McDermett was able to leave consulting behind and focus on building the company full-time.\nPerhaps consulting isn't your thing, but you still need work just to keep the lights on. Your side job and your startup don't necessarily have to be related. Prioritize working on your startup during your most productive hours, then take a part-time job on the side to make money. Whether it's tutoring or doing hourly manual labor, all sorts of jobs can give you the cushion you need to build your business during \"non-working\" hours.\nJason Ross, founder of JackThreads (sold to Thrillist) did exactly that. He worked as a bartender at night while building his online e-commerce business during the day.\nIt's possible stay put at your job and still move forward with your startup. You can use your position to learn valuable lessons that will pay dividends when you start your business. The key is to identify how you can take the initiative to teach yourself new skills, either at your job or on the side. If you're driven to succeed, you'll be able to make the most out the resources you have available.\nSean Broihier is an entrepreneur who kept his job and still built his skill set on the side. He founded FineArtAmerica.com while working as an engineer in New York City. On top of his full-time position and launching his startup on the side, Sean also taught himself to write code.\nSometimes business and family don't mix, but then again, sometimes they do. It can be risky to borrow money, but if you are confident your startup will succeed, it can help get you up and running.\nMom and dad have proven to be key supporters in some very successful entrepreneurs' lives. Jason Lucash and Mike Syzmcak, the founders of OrigAudio, borrowed money from Lucash's mom to help get their innovative startup off the ground. Their eco-friendly portable speakers were later featured on ABC's Shark Tank. So, where are they now? They're running a multi-million-dollar business and no longer have to rely on mom and dad.\nMaybe mom and dad won't or can't offer you a loan, but they might give you a roof over your head. In fact, living with your parents after school has become the hot new trend; 85 percent of recent college grads move back in with their parents.\nEarly on, Brendan Synnott and Kelly Flatley made this social sacrifice for their business. For 18 months, the founders of Bear Naked granola worked out of their parents' homes with no income. The company's first office space was a spare bedroom in Kelly's parents' house.

And That\u2019s Good.\n(By Bob McCurdy) There was a terrific article in ADWEEK recently by Andy Sippel, SVP at Advertising Perceptions, a business intelligence firm that serves the ad industry. It was titled, \u201cReach Is The New Black: Advertising\u2019s Mass Re-Awakening,\u201d with a sub-title that read, \u201cNarrow Targeting Has Its Uses But TV and Radio Offer Greater Impact.\u201d You can read the article here.\nI\u2019ve written extensively about the importance of \u201creaching\u201d rather than \u201cpreaching,\u201d liberally borrowing from a couple of expert marketing mavens, Erwin Ephron as well as Byron Sharp and Jenni Romaniuk, both of the Ehrenberg Bass Institute.\nThe scanner data Ephron referenced showed that households receiving a single advertisement bought 73% as much product as households receiving any number of advertisements. I recently uncovered the same point-of-diminishing-returns phenomenon while reviewing a Cumulus/Westwood One auto aftermarket study, which showed that those exposed to 1-2 commercials generated 2.4x the sales lift per ad dollar as those exposed to 3-6 commercials, and 3.7x the sales lift of those exposed to 7+ commercials.\nSharp and Romaniuk have also written extensively about the importance of reach in their book How Brands Grow, stressing the importance of reaching all consumers of the brand\u2019s/product service category, suggesting all marketing options be evaluated in terms of their ability to cost-effectively reach as many customers regardless of demo.\nLast year, P&G confirmed the importance of reach when their Chief Marketing Officer, Marc Pritchard, said, \u201cWe targeted too much and we went too narrow.\u201d In the same Wall Street Journal article, James Douglas, Executive Director of social media agency Society, an Interpublic company, referenced case studies that confirmed companies receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform\u2019s overall audience. Douglas highlighted a P&G example where they targeted Febreze ads to pet owners and households with large families, only to find that sales stagnated but rose when the target was expanded to include anyone over 18.\nRadio formats fall within this \u201cgrey area,\u201d enabling an advertiser to target both psychographically and demographically.\nThe takeaway from all of this? As Ephron wrote, \u201cstrive for as many first impressions as possible,\u201d which translates to aim for broad reach, as it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that lower campaign reach makes it harder to maintain the same sales level, let along grow.\nTwo key radio benefits, low cost and high reach, remain very attractive media propositions in 2017.\nWhat keeps consultants employed is this notion (all subjective) of what constitutes optimum frequency before the devil-diminishing returns- takes hold and wastes ad dollars.\nConsultants have been searching for that magical point for decades-a fool\u2019s errand if there ever was one-and still come up empty.\nPermit me to save you lots of effort, time and money.\nThe point of diminishing return does not exist. That\u2019s why it cannot be found.\nYou see, even after a prospect buys and most feel the project is complete, purchasers of a product are still listening to ads for that product, and each ad reassures them that their decision was wise.

Billy's been so obsessed with trying to find his parents, trying to find his family. And he's lived on the streets quite a few times in between all that. To him, that stuff is going on, but he's not caring so much about that.\nShazam!'s connection to the existing DC Universe of movies is somewhat unique in the massive superhero world that we all live in, while the events of movies like Justice League have clearly taken place in this new film, because our main character is all of 14-years-old, those events don't impact him directly. What's more, while some might find themselves living in awe of the superheroes amongst them, Billy Batson doesn't.\nBilly's ultimate goal in Shazam! isn't to be a hero, it's simply to find his mother. Billy is on his own in life but he believes his mother is still out there someplace and he's always looking for her. This has led to him living on the streets before ultimately being placed in a foster home. He's less than thrilled to find himself under a roof with several other foster kids. He's not looking for a family. He believes he already has one.\nThis lack of caring about people with superpowers might ultimately be the reason Billy Batson is given the power in the first place. Since he doesn't really want it, there's less of a chance he might abuse it.\nThis is why, when Billy Batson does gain the powers of Shazam, he needs to rely on his new foster brother Freddy, played by Jack Dylan Grazer. Freddy loves superheroes in the way that a real-life kid might idolize professional athletes. He knows everything there is to know about them, at least as much as everyday people know.\nIf most of us gained superpowers we'd likely know exactly what we wanted to do with them, but Billy Batson isn't like that. One wonders if a movie like Shazam! might appeal to those in our world who don't usually go in for the superhero genre. Perhaps the film's greater emphasis on comedy will mean that the Billy Batson's of the world might give this one a shot.\nOf course, all this doesn't necessarily mean that the DC Universe won't have a part to play in Shazam! The word on the street was that the film was trying to work out a cameo by Henry Cavill at one point, and while it looks like that may not happen, there's always the possibility the movie was able to quietly make it work, or decided to do something else to nod at the DC heroes. And if Shazam! is a hit, you can bet that the Justice League will be taking note of him in future movies. We'll find out when Shazam! hits screens in April."}

(AP) \u2014 Relatives of a man fatally shot by an Indiana State trooper are demanding answers after police said there was no body or dash camera video of what led up to last week\u2019s shooting along a western Indiana highway.\nThe cruiser driven by the trooper who shot 56-year-old Glenn A. Rightsell of Linden didn\u2019t have a dash camera, as some of the agency\u2019s cruisers do, and Indiana state troopers aren\u2019t equipped with body cameras, Sgt. Kim Riley said Monday.\nPolice have said the trooper fatally shot Rightsell on the night of Dec. 28 after he failed to follow his orders and allegedly grabbed a handgun on his own waist. Rightsell died later at a hospital.\nPolice said that three hours before the shooting, the trooper had tagged an abandoned sport utility vehicle along U.S. 231 in a rural area of Montgomery County just north of Crawfordsville, about 40 miles northwest of Indianapolis. The shooting occurred when the trooper returned, noticed a car parked in front of the SUV, which had its hood up, and stopped to investigate.\nRightsell\u2019s nephew, Matt Clark, said his uncle was working on his daughter\u2019s stalled Chevy Tahoe and that he always carried a gun on his belt.\n\u201cBody and dash cams protect everyone ... from injustices,\u201d he told the Journal & Courier .\nClark said Rightsell had called police ahead of time, asking them not to tow the vehicle until he had a chance to work on it. Riley said police were looking for a record of that call.\nRelatives and friends held a vigil Sunday in Crawfordsville for Rightsell, who was the owner of a masonry and tuck-pointing business in Linden, a rural Montgomery County town.\nMark Talbott, a Lafayette carpenter, said he\u2019s \u201cfurious\u201d over his friend\u2019s killing and said he doesn\u2019t believe the state police account of the shooting.\n\u201cI\u2019m of the opinion that everything they stated was not true, and meant to do nothing but protect the officers in question,\u201d he said.\nPolice have not released the name of the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave.\nRiley said that once the shooting investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to the county prosecutor, who would decide whether charges are warranted.\nPolice have not said how many shots the trooper fired or what verbal commands he gave Rightsell. The state police account also did not say whether Rightsell drew his gun or fired any shots.\nKen Steen, who lives across from the shooting scene, filmed video of the shooting aftermath. That footage appears to show officers telling Rightsell to come to them on his knees, with his hands over his head, before he\u2019s handcuffed and they walk him from the scene.\nSteen said he didn\u2019t know Rightsell had been shot until the following day.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to admit I don\u2019t know what happened, yet.

The result? Just over four minutes of hilarity that is \"It's Not a Moon\". You can check it out in the video above.\nThe video uses parts from multiple scenes in the movie but centers on the scene where, after having been arrested by Darth Vader, Leia is taken to Tarkin who threatens to destroy her home planet of Alderaan with the Death Star unless she tells them where the hidden Rebel base is located. Leia gives them a location, but Tarkin destroys Alderaan anyway. In Star Wars the scene is incredibly powerful and dramatic, but when added to music with some hilariously bad lip reading -- the line \"now I have to go teach the kids to drink powdered goat bladders\" comes to mind -- it turns into a nearly perfect musical sure to make fans want more.\n\"It's Not a Moon\" is just the latest time that Bad Lip Reading has taken on the Star Wars universe. Bad Lip Reading has frequently visited the galaxy far, far away often taking scenes and moments from the iconic films and giving them a wild musical reimagining. Previously, The Empire Strikes Back saw Yoda declare that he \"love to groove and boogie\" in \"Seagulls! (Stop It Now)\" among others.\nLike the Yoda-centric video before it, \"It's Not a Moon\" is pretty catchy and even though Tarkin, Vader and the Empire are the bad guys, we can't help but root for them as we sing along. After all, as the song says, they have the ultimate power in the universe. Who are we to argue with that?\nOf course, if you prefer the real sounds of the Star Wars saga, you're in luck there, too.

{"idx": "11715", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Coronal heating remains one of the key problems to be solved in astrophysics. Magnetic reconnection is one of the proposed mechanisms that dissipate the required energy to heat the corona. In this work, we test this mechanism by measuring the heat flux delivered by magnetic reconnection with observed magnetograms.\nIn the absence of coronal reconnection, field-line footpoints move at the same velocity as the plasma they are rooted in. The rate of coronal reconnection is therefore related to any discrepancy between footpoint motion and local plasma motion, called non-ideal motion. We propose a novel method to measure this velocity discrepancy by combining a sequence of non-linear force-free field extrapolations with maps of photospheric velocity. We get both from a sequence of HMI vector magnetograms of active region NOAA 11416 on 11 February 2012. The measurement of the non-ideal velocity can be found in Figure 1.\nFigure 1| A model showing the non-ideal velocity and the measurement results. a, Coronal loops show the measurement of the non-ideal velocity. The letters p and n stand for the conjugate footpoints of a loop and the subscripts 0 and 1 refer to time labels for the start and end time, t0 and t1, respectively. The yellow loop represents the initial loop at t0 and the transparent yellow loop is the hypothetical version at time t1 under the assumption of ideal MHD. The footpoints are advected to new places by the photopsheric plasma flow, as indicated by the red and blue arrows in positive and negative polarities, respectively. The orange loop is the actual coronal loop at time t1. The distance denoted by the two-headed arrow is the non-ideal distance \u03b4n due to magnetic diffusion (reconnection). b, The extrapolated magnetic field at 18:10 UT. c, The photospheric plasma velocity field overplotted on the vertical magnetogram from HMI (background). The blue and red arrows represent the plasma flow of positive and negative magnetic flux, respectively. d, The force-free parameter, \u03b1, calculated from the vector magnetogram at 18:10 UT. e, The measured non-ideal velocity. Here, we only calculate the non- ideal velocity where both footpoints of the field lines are rooted within the field of view and |B| > 20 G in the magnetograms. f, The heating flux calculated from the reconnection model with the parameter \u2112 = 160 km.\nWe build up the relationship between the non-ideal velocity and the heating due entirely to coronal re- connection. The heating rate can be expressed as , where \u03b1 is the force-free parameter,vs is the non-ideal velocity, and \u2112 is the diameter of the reconnected flux element. We fix it at 160 km in our model, which is consistent with the characteristic scale of the observed strands[2,3]. The result is shown in Figure 1f. This heating rate is used to predict density and temperature at points along an equilibrium loop. This in turn is used to synthesize emission in EUV (see Figure 2). Many corresponding structures can be found between them, e.g., the brightening loops, moss structures and large loops (indicated by numbers 1\u20134 in Figure 2).\nFigure 2| Observations and synthesized EUV images showing the loop structures.

Only in Germany is there an official intention to privatize the entire national rail system.\nUnder the provisions of a government white paper, \"New Opportunities for the Railways,\" and now under close study by transport specialists, most British train passenger services will be run by private sector companies.\nThere will be a central franchising authority, Railtrack, to coordinate the system. Otherwise, market economics will be the touchstone to the system's success or failure.\nMajor has given his personal backing to the plan to sell off BR. In the April general election campaign he defended privatizing BR as a \"natural follow-up\" to Margaret Thatcher's successful privatization of many state-owned enterprises.\nUnveiling the plan, Transport Secretary John MacGregor noted that BR was soaking up more than British pounds1 billion ($1.92 billion) in state subsidies annually.\nMr. MacGregor said BR has been \"more insulated from the demands of the market than its private sector airline, coach, and road haulage competitors. It therefore has fewer incentives to improve its performance and less freedom to respond to what the customer wants. Radical changes are needed.\" The changes the government proposes are sparking lively interest in the transport industry. Five private companies are reported to be seriously interested in operating sections of BR's network.\nRichard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, said last month that he planned to lease four trains a day from BR and run airline-style services, including free meals, between London and Edinburgh, starting next summer.\n\"We intend to expand the market, and we will be bringing a quality of service to rail that's unheard of in Britain,\" Mr. Branson said July 21. He intends to hire high-speed trains from BR, refurbish the coaches, and pay a track fee to Railtrack. Virgin sources last weekend said Branson's rail experts were preparing a pilot scheme to put to the government.\nSEA Containers, owners of the luxury Orient Express, which carries passengers between London and Venice, and the British Airports Authority, have expressed an interest in leasing railtrack.\nA much bolder development was foreshadowed July 29 by senior managers of InterCity, the BR network that links Britain's major metropolitan areas. They were reported to be proposing a management buyout, backed by private capital, that would keep InterCity's 1,869 miles of track under a single management, displacing the present BR board.\nAn InterCity manager involved in the bid said: \"A buyout of the entire network would preserve the existing integrated system and make it possible to place administration on a new footing.

Even if Mother Nature fails to cooperate, resort management can make enough snow to simulate a white Christmas. Most resorts offer some sort of winter holiday celebration, but some go the extra mile to create a memorable Christmas ski vacation. Most resorts have terrain for all levels, state-of-the-art snow-making and offer Christmas programming that is rarely experienced at other resorts.\nThe hills come alive with the Christmas spirit in Stowe, VT. This picturesque town is often suggested as the best place to bring a non-skiing significant other. Stowe, founded in 1794, is known for its winding roads, covered bridges and steepled churches. Its historic Main Street is home to a diversity of shops and restaurants. The Stowe Community Church has a non-denominational Christmas Eve service, and a Handel's Messiah Community Sing-In. Alpine skiers will enjoy the world-class Stowe Mountain Resort. The Trapp Family Lodge, owned by the Von Trapp family of \u201cSound of Music Fame,\" has Nordic skiing, snowshoeing and sleigh rides.\nThe Omni Mount Washington Resort was built in 1902. This grand hotel, famous for its ornate Spanish Renaissance Revival architecture, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It's on the property of the Bretton Woods Ski Resort, which has groomed trails that are an intermediate skier's paradise. Skiers returning from the slopes are greeted by the sound of carolers roaming through the lobby and the smell of hot apple cider and chestnuts roasting on an open fire. The Omni Mountain Resort offers a Holiday Traditions Package, which includes accommodations, daily breakfast, a hand-picked tree and wreath from the nearby Rocks Estate and a group sleigh ride.\nThe Copper Mountain Ski Resort and its neighboring town of Frisco, CO, offer a variety of Christmas activities. In 2010, the festivities start Dec. 4, when local merchants compete in the annual wassail recipe contest. A wassail is a type of English apple cider. Visitors can shop, try the wassails and vote on your favorite. Santa is available for photos at Frisco Historic Park, and he and his elves visit the Copper Mountain Resort during Christmas. On Christmas Eve, the resort's ski-school staff performs a traditional torchlight parade down the mountain, and Santa, his elves and his reindeer lead a torchlight parade through the Village at Copper.\nBreckenridge is in a former Victorian mining town that has preserved many of its historic homes and buildings and has a variety of Christmas events. The Breckenridge Heritage Alliance sponsors story-telling and Christmas parties at its free museums. Breckenridge Stables offers carriage rides around the town. The Breckenridge Ski Resort does its torchlight parade on New Year's Eve, and the Breckenridge Recreation Center provides a special New Year's Eve party for kids, which features dinner and kid-friendly activities. You can stay on mountain, but most of the fun happens in town. The Fireside Inn is located on French Street, which is where most of the towns authentic Victorian homes are located. The inn is across the street from the Father Dyer Church. During the mining era of the 1800s, Dyer when form town to town on his skis, delivering the mail along with the word of God.

Consumer Reports asked 1,900 people who they tipped and who they stiffed during the holiday season and found that the majority tipped just two types of people -- housekeepers and teachers -- and they didn't tip overwhelmingly generously.\nEveryone else was more likely to get stiffed than tipped, according to the survey. But that's based on the national average, said Tobie Stanger, a CR editor who led the research effort. Who you tip and how much you give is a very regional affair. People who live in big cities and the coasts were more generous than those living in middle America, she said. Who you are expected to tip can even vary by neighborhood.\nStanger says the school bus driver gets tipped in her neighborhood, even though bus drivers didn't register on the survey. A lot of New Yorkers tip their doormen, too. But the magazine didn't come up with a median tip for doormen because there wasn't enough data to deliver national numbers. There just aren't a ton of doormen in California and Kansas.\nIf you move into a new neighborhood, Stanger suggests you get tips on tipping from the neighbors so you don't run afoul of local custom. The Emily Post foundation provides practical tips on tipping too.\n\"If you think tipping is important, it really needs to be part of your holiday budget -- just like food and postage and wrapping paper,\" she said.\nNeed help on who gets tipped and how much? Here are the results from Consumer Reports latest survey showing who consumers tipped and stiffed and how much they got. The tip amounts are medians -- the midpoint between highs and lows. That filters out the super-generous tippers, who gave $500 to the housekeeper, as well as the penny-ante tips from the Scrooges among us.\nHairdresser: Just 48% of those surveyed gave their hairdresser a holiday gift. Median value: $20.\nNewspaper delivery: As newspapers have struggled in recent years, Stanger said customers have apparently become more likely to tip the delivery people getting up in the wee hours to plop their newspaper paper in the bushes. Some 49% tipped the newspaper carrier. Median value: $15.\nManicurist: 48% gave something to their manicurist at the holidays. Median value: $15.\nMail Carrier: To be fair, the postal service discourages tipping, telling patrons that they shouldn't give cash and can only give gift cards if they're worth less than $20 and can't be turned into cash. That means 79% of mail carriers get nothing. The 21% who get something, get a gift worth $20.\nGardener: Only 23% of those surveyed tipped the lawn crew, according to Consumer Reports. That's the bad news. The good news is that the tip amount was the second-most generous recorded in the survey. Median tip: $25.\nBarber: It's clearly better to cut a woman's hair than a man's. Almost half of women tipped their hairdresser; just 34% of guys tipped the barber. But the tip amount was the same. Median value: $20."}

What's more, Purdue is recycling the tactics it developed to trick, coerce or bribe doctors into overprescribing its flagship product Oxycontin in other countries, creating fresh mountains of corpses and mountains of cash.\nThe Sacklers are pretty much Exhibit A when it comes to using philanthropy to launder the reputations of capitalism's most immoral, rapacious beasts. As Anand Giridharadas has forcefully argued, one of the major functions of \"charitable giving\" is to deflect attention away from the blood on a billionaire's hands (the other function is to allow billionaires to turn their pet theories into public policy, and here the Sacklers also shine, helping to destroy the life-chances of a whole generation by funding privatization efforts that shut down public schools and replace them with underperforming \"charter schools\").\nNan Goldin is a legendary photographer who nearly died when she got hooked on the Sacklers' products after a routine surgery. She's the founder of a pressure group called PAIN (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), which is modelled on the AIDS activist group ACT-UP, following their example with high profile, flashy direct actions that lift the rock on wrongdoing and its enablers.\nThis weekend, PAIN targeted both the Guggenheim and the Met in New York; groups of activists dressed as normal museumgoers trickled into the Guggenheim and fanned out in small cells. Then Goldin entered the building and drew a small crowd (her work hangs in the Guggenheim) and at an agreed-upon signal, the activists showered \"prescriptions\" from the atrium railings on every floor of the Guggenheim, in which Robert Sackler, MD prescribes massive amounts of Oxycontin to Solomon R. Guggenheim -- calling attention to the massive sums that the Guggenheim has taken from the Sacklers, and the massive credibility that the Guggenheim has returned to the Sacklers, helping to make them synonymous with philanthropy, rather than murder.\nGoldin let the protesters in a call-and-response that made their message and demands clear: \"We want their money. For safe-consumption sites. For harm reduction. For treatment. It\u2019s time, Guggenheim! Take down their names!\" Then the chant broke out: \"Oxy money is in the halls! Throw them out if you have the balls!\"\nThe prescriptions that PAIN showered the Guggenheim with bore a quote from a discussion between Oxycontin inventor Robert Kaiko and Purdue's Richard Sackler, revealed in a filing by Massachusetts Attorney General in a lawsuit over Purdue's wrongdoing in the opioid epidemic: \"If OxyContin is uncontrolled, it is highly likely that it will eventually be abused . . .

It was first launched three years ago, when the test included some mathematics but focused primarily on reading literacy.\nThe scores of U.S. students during that first round of testing were comparable with those in other countries, but the performance on this round, conducted during 2003, was markedly poorer.\nIn mathematics literacy, which measured students\u2019 ability to make judgments about space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and mathematical uncertainties, the U.S. score was 483, below the average score of 500 for industrialized nations. The United States ranked 24th out of 29 nations in that category.\nThe problem-solving abilities of Americans were no better. The U.S. students earned an average combined score of 477, below the international average among industrialized countries of 500, also resulting in a ranking of 24th out of 29 nations. PISA officials do not give a top score on those sections of the test, but the international average for the highest-percentile scores among industrialized nations were 660 for math literacy and 655 for problem-solving.\nA report on the 2003 PISA results is available from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\u201cThis data tells us we\u2019re not as competitive as we need to be on the ability of our 15-year-old students,\u201d Eugene W. Hickok, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, said at a Dec. 6 press conference here announcing the results.\nFinland ranked at the top of industrialized nations in mathematics literacy, with a score of 544, followed by South Korea, the Netherlands, and Japan. South Korea, Finland, Japan, and New Zealand were at the top of the list in problem-solving.\nOver the past decade, a number of international measurements and analyses of student academic ability, most notably the Trends in International Mathematics Study, or TIMSS, have shown the United States with relatively unimpressive results compared with other countries\u2019. Those results have been especially poor among socioeconomically disadvantaged students in the United States.\nAt a time when many U.S. educators and policymakers are consumed with the task of improving the academic performance of schools and districts, that issue is likely to be thrust into a worldwide context in the coming weeks. As international leaders scrutinize PISA scores, the latest TIMSS results are scheduled to be released Dec. 14.\nPISA is conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovermental research and policy organization based in Paris that focuses on education, trade, and other social and economic issues.

{"idx": "11736", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Australian telecommunications (telco) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in today. Their networks and services have fostered professional work environments and have brought together family and friends amidst Australia\u2019s vast distances, and remote global position. But to continue doing so at an ever-changing pace, telco providers must accelerate their digital revolution.\nIn fact Accenture, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, has estimated that digitalisation could contribute approximately $100 trillion in value to the telecommunications industry over the next decade globally.\nAustralian telecommunications operators have long maintained vast networks, held together by complex infrastructure. The next stage of digital transformation will involve virtualising networks that are otherwise bound to physical hardware. This is becoming ever more important as the lifecycles of current physical networks reduce. Being locked into the wrong physical network decision can be debilitating with escalating investment profiles. Even nbn, an organisation focused on the physical connectivity of premises, is applying virtualisation for future benefit.\nVirtualising the current physical hardware promises to fundamentally change the basis of future service, by creating self-optimising and secure zero-touch networks. This will provide improvements in customer experience and flexibility through exposure of virtual capabilities. It will also create stepwise improvements in operational efficiency for the network providers. In fact, 64 percent of telco operators globally believe that the adoption of these technologies will be driven by the appeal of cheaper purchase and maintenance costs.\nConnectivity has been traditionally in the sphere of humans through phones, pagers and now smart-phones. However, the increased digital transformation of consumers\u2019 lives and businesses presents the Australian telco industry with important opportunities to extend revenue streams beyond human connectivity, through integrated internet of things (IoT) solutions.\nFor example Telstra recently deployed Narrowband technology in its IoT Network which connects millions of new devices by sending small volumes of data over Telstra\u2019s mobile. The network offers coverage in major Australian cities and many regional towns, and supports millions of devices like sensors, trackers and alarms to have a battery life of years.\nTo win the race for customer loyalty and mindshare, Australian telco players will need to increasingly deploy features and tools that deliver delightful digital experiences. Beyond the strict new complaints system recently proposed by the Federal government, earning and retaining customer loyalty will continue to be a central concern of the telco providers. In fact, Accenture\u2019s research found that over 75% of consumers are quicker to retract their loyalty to brands than they were three years ago. This goal is especially important as digitisation has increased expectations - customers now expect the high-quality digital experiences they receive in leading industries to be matched by companies in other sectors.\nThe telco industry is fuelled by innovation. The need for rapid innovation, greater convergence and new services means that telco providers must fill capability gaps using new innovation models and revamped talent strategies for a digital workforce. A prime example of this is Optus, which recently-unveiled their Innovation Hub in Sydney. The hub is a dedicated workspace that will see Optus\u2019 small-to-medium (SMB) businesses collaborate with start-ups and tackle current and future-state SMB issues.\nAcross Australia today, industry leaders are quickly realising that digitalisation has immense potential. A core enabler of digitisation is the leverage of ecosystems to power an organisation. Telco\u2019s have the potential to play a key role in the connection and cooperation of digital ecosystems.\nJonathan Restarick is the communications, media and technology lead for Accenture in Australia and New Zealand."}

That element has remained and is a great thing.\nThe constitution was drafted by U.S. forces occupying Japan after World War II, though Japan modified the draft somewhat before adoption.\nSometimes it just seems like some people want to whine about anything and everything.\nNothing wrong with Japan's constitution, as is. Japan needs to accept losing the war, in hindsight, was a great outcome.\nWho thinks it's arrogant? The people who want to be rid of the 'embarrassment of a constitution forced on them from the US'? There can be no doubt the US wrote it, but the thing is, it is that very US written Constitution that has allowed Japan to enjoy 71 years of relative peace. It might be a bit of a bitter pill to swallow, sure, but is what Japan had before, where it was reduced to ashes, better? Should they draft their own by the hands of those that would like to see a \"stronger Japan\" and a return to said country that was reduced to ashes?\nIt may have been written by someone else, and it may have been forced on the nation at the time, but it is JAPAN'S Constitution and no other countries, and they have done very well with it up to now. Japan can thank itself, largely, for that. They also have the power to keep on the path of peace or change it.\nThe last thing you ever want to do in diplomacy: tell it like it is.\nBiden talking like an old southern slave owner.\nWhich article in the US Constitution is the \"peace article\"?\nVice president Biden said, \u201cDoes he not understand we wrote Japan\u2019s Constitution to say that they could not be a nuclear power?\u201d He said it was a criticism against the opponent candidate Mr Trump's approval of nuclear armament by Japan. We cannot help but say he was exceptional and reckless as an important official of the US government.\nTrump did not approve possession of nuclear weapons by Japan.\nIt is interesting to see how words are taken out of context.\nBiden screwed up here definitely.\nThough it is to a great degree true, the United States cannot admit they \"wrote\" Japan's constitution without seriously damaging its legitimacy.\nBiden's failure to understand this simple and basic principle makes his competency doubtful.\nAnd what makes it worse,is that his comments are giving ammunition to Abe and his ilk about the need to push thru change in the constitution because our former \"colonial rulers\" still look down on us though we are the third most powerful economy in the world. A poor choice of words by the Biden.\nSo the truth hurts then?\nThe question is not who wrote it, but is it any good. The test of time shows that it is a good constitution. But an amendment needs to be added: periodic reapportionment like the US. One country bumpkin vote is worth 4 to 7 city votes. This needs to be changed. Then there will be less talk about changing the constitution.\n@Kazuaki: Respectfully, it's a known fact that the USA drafted the Japanese constitution.\nAfter the initial draft, many Japanese scholars in fact wanted to make many changes are were simply \"not allowed\" by MacArthur and company. Some things they did budge on was more...mechanical stuff of government (eg. allowing two governing houses instead of one).\nThere really wasn't a lot of direct hands-on work by Japanese on the Japanese constitution; it was more \"Yeah ok, we'll take"}

When that happens in the corporate sector, various stakeholders\u2014be they employees, customers or shareholders\u2014have to put up with a phase of uncertainty.\nIn these matters, unitholders (though directly affected) are not consulted. However, all takeovers are not the same, and your (unitholders\u2019) response to them should vary accordingly.\nWhen this happens, you could remain invested if the purchaser\u2019s pedigree inspires comfort. In such cases, you will usually have a clear idea about who will manage your scheme. These schemes may either continue to exist separately or may be merged into an acquirer\u2019s existing scheme in due course.\nFor example, Birla Mutual Fund took over Alliance Mutual Fund\u2019s schemes. Some of the earlier schemes still exist, including Alliance Frontline Equity, which is now Birla Sun Life Frontline Equity. The performance of the schemes has not deteriorated due to this takeover.\nIn an increasingly globalized world, where the proverbial flutter of a butterfly\u2019s wings in China causes an earthquake in California, such \u201csponsor\" changes may be due to reasons completely unconnected with the local outfit\u2019s performance or business outlook. For instance, in 2009, Barclays Bank Plc had to sell off its profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) business to BlackRock Inc owing to losses suffered in its other divisions.\nIt may also be the result of a \u201cstrategic review\" conducted by the sponsor or be based on the recommendations of a management consultancy.\nWhatever the reasons, such changes are a cause of concern to unitholders. In such cases, they should first inspect the credentials of the new owners and the relevant skills that they bring to the table. Often, the purchaser will be some deep-pocketed industrial or financial powerhouse, but unitholders should not be unduly impressed by this. MFs are essentially pass-through vehicles. Hence, the risks faced by unitholders are neither mitigated nor enhanced by the financial standing of the sponsor. What really matters, is the quality of fund management. If the fund managers of the old fund are competent but the new owner is unable or unwilling to retain them, then investors could consider exiting, especially if the purchaser currently lacks a good fund management team. However, if the new owner categorically states that the old team will be retained, then unitholders may breathe easy.\nTwo such instances are, HDFC Mutual Fund\u2019s takeover of Zurich Asset Management Co. and Infrastructure Development Finance Corp.\u2019s takeover of Standard Chartered Mutual Fund. Here both the purchasers were financial behemoths but they lacked fund management expertise. Hence, instead of reinventing the wheel, they retained the old team. This move has immensely benefited both unitholders and fund sponsors.\nIn the case of Templeton\u2019s purchase of Kothari Pioneer, the new owner could easily have jettisoned the old team, considering that it is a formidable global fund house itself. However, they chose to retain and nurture this team as they had acquitted themselves well in the Indian markets. Again, this proved to be a boon for unitholders who held on.\nToday, takeovers are in the limelight once again, owing to the recent stake sale by Fidelity Mutual Fund. I am not too sanguine about this particular transaction. While the purchaser is part of one of India\u2019s largest congl"}

No more smell of pine trees as you go up Kennon, and the city itself was an urban mess.\nOnly the Country Club and the part of John Hay adjacent to it looked like the Baguio we remembered from our youth. Because of that disappointment, I had no good reason to go up north for a while. So it was my first time to use TPLEX all the way to Pangasinan last week. It was fantastic!\nConstructing TPLEX had been talked about for years. I remember sitting in one such discussion when we were rehabilitating NLEX. Our decision was to delay investing in it because the traffic count wouldn\u2019t justify the cost.\nBut I recall that we joined a consortium composed of other fairly large construction companies with the intention of eventually doing TPLEX. Then I heard nothing more about it for a while.\nThe next thing I heard about TPLEX was that Ramon Ang bought out most, if not all of the consortium members, as he decided to do TPLEX on his own. He was not worried about the low traffic count.\nWhen I asked him why he isn\u2019t waiting for the traffic count to rise before building TPLEX, he said he is taking a long term view. He also said he is not just thinking of the traffic count in his business model, but everything else that would bring in revenues. Think logistics for consumer and agricultural products. Think Petron service stations, and, he adds\u2026 an improved economy.\nFor the same reason, RSA wants to extend it all the way to the Ilocos provinces in a route with an even lower traffic count. For now, he wants to extend it far enough for motorists to immediately start climbing up to Baguio upon exit from the tollway.\nIn my last conversation with RSA, he said that the only thing delaying the extension of TPLEX is right of way. I know San Miguel went through a lot of ROW difficulties to get to where TPLEX is now.\nIt is fair to think that if we waited for government to do TPLEX, we still wouldn\u2019t have it today. For that matter, even the run-of-the-mill private sector taipans wouldn\u2019t do TPLEX until the traffic count was high enough to guarantee a good profit.\nRSA is that weird kind of business leader who thinks differently by emphasizing long term gains. No president in our history even thinks like him.\nI once asked him why he is building infrastructure projects that won\u2019t deliver profits right away. He said he looks at the potential benefit the project will bring to the economy. He thinks that if the economy moves up, so will San Miguel\u2019s diverse businesses.\nOne time, when the interest of foreign investors in our country was very low, I asked RSA what he thought about it. He quickly said that is not a problem because that gives locals like San Miguel more investment opportunities.

If you're after a smartwatch that looks like a premium, fashionable watch, this isn't the device for you, but if you want a smartwatch that's comfortable, fuss-free and easy to use, the Watch Style is well-worth considering.\nWhen the LG Watch Style was announced in February 2017, it was one of the only Android Wear 2.0 watches, which gave it a notable point of interest. Six months on, however, at the point of its release, it faces some tough competition from the likes of Huawei, Tag Heuer and Montblanc \u2013 all of which are gunning for some of the AW2.0 smartwatch pie.\nUnlike the higher-spec and rugged LG Watch Sport version \u2013 which we're yet to hear when or even if it will grace us with its presence \u2013 the Watch Style is simple and subtle in its approach, unlike the better built, tougher and bulkier competition.\nDoes the LG Watch Style succeed in its endeavours? Or is it too simple to make it as enticing an option as those watches from the established fashion and watch brands?\nThe LG Watch Style is the slimmer of LG's two Android Wear 2.0 watches. The Watch Sport is chunky and rugged, while the Style is the sleeker of the two, offering a slim build at just under 11mm.\nThe watch body is stainless steel, while the back is plastic, though it doesn't feel cheap like the LG Watch Urbane. It doesn't have as much to look at as the likes of the Tag Heuer Modular 45 and the materials don't look or feel as premium as the Montblanc Summit, but these devices are significantly more expensive. We're talking at least three times the price.\nThe LG Watch Style is light \u2013 a little too light if you're seeking a true watch-like experience \u2013 which could be seen as one of its biggest attributes, as it's easy to forget it's even on the wrist. It's comfortable to wear and it looks good on a smaller arm \u2013 something that can't necessarily be said for the Montblanc or the Tag, depending on your style preference.\nThe Watch Style comes in three colourways, each of which has an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. We had the titanium model in for review which comes with a black leather strap, but we prefer the rose gold model we initially saw back in February. The rose gold appears to have a little bit more to it, with less risk of being mistaken for a toy watch \u2013 like this titanium model on review occasionally did.\nWhich is a notable point: even though the Watch Style ticks the metal box for its use of titanium, it goes to show that materials not finished in a certain way can present themselves unfavourably. We've had colleagues handle the Style who thought it was a plastic watch. There's only so much a leather strap can negate that perception.\nThe straps on the Watch Style are easily changed, requiring a simple pull back of the pins positioned on the underside of the device and unhooking the strap. We'd therefore probably choose the rose gold model and change the strap, or add a more exciting strap to the titanium model to give it a bit more style, as its name supposedly suggests.\nThere is one central rotatable crown on the right of the Watch Style's watch face, rather than the three on the Watch"}

The imperative to design something unique and individual tends to override considerations of how it might shape the behaviours of those who will live with it. That could be about to change.\nLast month, the Conscious Cities Conference in London considered how cognitive scientists might make their discoveries more accessible to architects. The conference brought together architects, designers, engineers, neuroscientists and psychologists, all of whom increasingly cross paths at an academic level, but still rarely in practice.\nOne of the conference speakers, Alison Brooks, an architect who specialises in housing and social design, told BBC Future that psychology-based insights could change how cities are built. \u201cIf science could help the design profession justify the value of good design and craftsmanship, it would be a very powerful tool and quite possibly transform the quality of the built environment,\u201d she says.\nGreater interaction across the disciplines would, for example, reduce the chances of repeating such architectural horror stories as the 1950s Pruitt-Igoe housing complex in St Louis, Missouri, whose 33 featureless apartment blocks \u2013 designed by Minoru Yamasaki, also responsible for the World Trade Center \u2013 quickly became notorious for their crime, squalour and social dysfunction. Critics argued that the wide open spaces between the blocks of modernist high-rises discouraged a sense of community, particularly as crime rates started to rise. They were eventually demolished in 1972.\nPruitt-Igoe was not an outlier. The lack of behavioural insight behind the modernist housing projects of that era, with their sense of isolation from the wider community and ill-conceived public spaces, made many of them feel, in the words of British grime artist Tinie Tempah, who grew up in one, as if they\u2019d been \u201cdesigned for you not to succeed\u201d.\nToday, thanks to psychological studies, we have a much better idea of the kind of urban environments that people like or find stimulating. Some of these studies have attempted to measure subjects\u2019 physiological responses in situ, using wearable devices such as bracelets that monitor skin conductance (a marker of physiological arousal), smartphone apps that ask subjects about their emotional state, and electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets that measure brain activity relating to mental states and mood.\n\u201cThis adds a layer of information that is otherwise difficult to get at,\u201d said Colin Ellard, who researches the psychological impact of design at the University of Waterloo in Canada. \u201cWhen we ask people about their stress they say it\u2019s no big deal, yet when we measure their physiology we discover that their responses are off the charts.

My father could not vote till 1985, when the residents of the camp finally got their voter cards. But we can vote. We have a say in matters that concern us,\" says Subhash Barman, 43, whose family crossed over from Sylhet in Bangladesh in 1964. Subhash was born in the camp.\nThe residents of the camp here, set up in 1964 long before the 1971 cut-off date for determining citizenship in Assam, were provided voter cards by the government, granting them a degree of legitimacy no one ever questioned. But a lot has changed since 2014.\nThis time, they find themselves in a liminal space of belonging, caught in a maze of citizenship tests with no way out. The three pressing concerns are the National Register of Citizens (NRC) update, the ever-looming threat of notices served by Foreigners' Tribunals and the dread of finding their names marked as 'D' (doubtful) voter on the electoral rolls.\n\"We want the Narendra Modi government to come back and re-introduce the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill,\" Subhash says. It, after all, is the one citizenship test the inmates here know they can definitely pass.The proposed amendment to the Citizenship Act sought to extend citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The bill, which led to an uproar across the northeast, did not make it past the Parliament and is set to lapse with the outgoing Lok Sabha. For those here, on the other hand, it offers the only ray of hope in an otherwise bleak scenario.\n\"We also support the NRC update process. Instead of facing constant harassment, the matter will be resolved once and for all,\" Subhash says. The NRC update process, initiated during the Congress regime but taken forward during BJP's rule in the state, has excluded most in the camp. Why the optimism then? \"At least we are getting to know about cases in Foreigners' Tribunals against us and being marked as 'D' voters,\" says Malay Ghosh, who was moved here from the refugee camp in Silchar a few years ago.\nThings also changed when the Supreme Court struck down the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983, which lay the onus of proof on whoever filed a complaint challenging the citizenship status of another. The Supreme Court verdict had come on the basis of a petition filed by Sarbananda Sonowal, who is now chief minister of Assam. \"Since then, things have been difficult. Anyone can file a complaint and we have to keep making the rounds at foreigners' tribunals or end up being detained,\" saysSubhash. The IM(DT) Act, which they say helped them, however, was introduced by the Congress government under Indira Gandhi. Will they factor that into their choice for the Lok Sabha election? \"We need to look at the present scenario. What is past is past,\" he replies.\n\"Right now, it is BJP all the way for us. This"}

Let\u2019s call these collaborative ecosystem applications platforms. Marshall Van Alstyne explained the logic of these platforms in his book Platform Revolution. We should all be excited about such applications.\nIn a technological sense, blockchain is key for creating an unalterable, trusted record of certain types of transactions. But the problem is that blockchain tech isn\u2019t really needed for all collaborative ecosystem applications.\nSo, how can each of us figure out what blockchain really means to us? When is the excitement about blockchain about a collaborative ecosystem application that does not in actuality need blockchain? When do such apps really require blockchain? How can existing enterprise data feed blockchain applications and vice versa?\nAs a start of this series of articles, I am going to focus on how Syncsort is answering these questions. Syncsort is a company that focuses on building the infrastructure to support the modern data supply chain. With products for data integration, data quality, capacity management, mainframe optimization, high availability and security, Syncsort is dedicated to the general proposition of its tagline: Advancing Data. On my podcast, I recently spoke with Syncsort\u2019s CEO Josh Rogers and CTO Dr. Tend\u00fc Yo\u011furt\u00e7u. The way they are making sense of blockchain provides important lessons.\nSyncsort has identified four megatrends that they are paying especially close attention to and ensuring that their business strategy aligns with. Those are the cloud, streaming data and IoT, data science (which includes machine learning and AI), and data governance. Yo\u011furt\u00e7u told me that Syncsort views blockchain, in many ways, as falling under the data governance mantle and that as a result, the company is focusing on early research and product development to support the growing adoption and expansion of blockchain usage.\nBoth Rogers and Yo\u011furt\u00e7u see the greatest benefits from blockchain in applications where manual confirmation or cross-border parties are involved, or where automatic tracking and validation visible to all parties is desired. Blockchain helps to eliminate the middleman in many transactions and improves security by validating the authenticity of products and components and reducing counterfeiting. But blockchain-ready applications and tools are nascent and they must mature for blockchain to be widely adopted.\nBut Syncsort is preparing for this growing adoption because blockchain has applicability in so many sectors, especially those with supply chains, from food to car manufacturing, to cross-border trade. Blockchain can reduce the complexity of tracking these chains and simplify and solidify contractual arrangements between companies.\nIn addition, Syncsort is very focused on software for the fast-growing Big Iron to Big Data market, driven by the need for data-driven organizations to quickly extract value from critical data across their enterprise, often moving this data from traditional data systems like IBM mainframes and midrange systems and then seamlessly integrating it into a growing number of next-generation analytical platforms. The ability to access and integrate traditional and blockchain data for analysis will be part of this equation.\nGiven this context of what blockchain can do best, it\u2019s worth returning to the original question of when using blockchain makes the most sense. Rogers told me that part of the difficulty of answering the question is that blockchain technology is still in such early stages.\nRogers added that S"}

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a massive game, a long title made even longer by the fact that fast travel barely exists and you will often spend a ton of time simply getting from location to location. That\u2019s a topic for another article (by the end, I appreciated those slower moments), but it is not unfair for people with school and lives and jobs and families to wonder if they will ever finish a game this big.\nThe truth is most people probably won\u2019t.\nThe original Red Dead Redemption had something like a 10% completion rate, and is often cited as an example of a great game that people rarely finished when all was said and done. Perhaps RDR2 will fare better, but it is longer, and I would be amazed if it cracked 20% completion among the millions of players that have bought it.\nI didn\u2019t do much random exploring until the very end of the game after the main storyline was over.\nBut those 55-65 hours is the main storyline. Without going into any story spoilers whatsoever, I will say that there is also an epilogue to Red Dead Redemption 2 that is not just \u201cone final mission\u201d the way you might expect, but an entirely separate, 6-7 hour arc. After that, I did about another hour of exploring (finding the original RDR1 map, which is all but empty). I still have not done any legendary hunts or challenges, so I could go back for those. Being fully \u201cdone\u201d with all the story quests, I am at 80% completion, for those keeping an eye on that metric.\nAll in all, this means that just to clear the main story, you are probably looking at a minimum of 55-60 hours if you blaze through it, and probably more like 70-80 hours if you take any amount of time. Trying to 100% the game with all its extra content will probably easily make it top 100 hours. And this is all before the online component comes out.\nIt is a shame that because of its sheer size, so many people won\u2019t finish Red Dead Redemption 2, because while yes, it is fun along the way, sure, the game\u2019s biggest payoffs come in its final acts, 45-50+ hours in. And without getting into the content of the Epilogue, you are absolutely going to want to reach that and play through it if you want a satisfying conclusion to the story. And again, that could put you at 60-75 hours at least.\nI do not regret spending this much time with RDR2, but I will be amazed if people who can only game an hour or two a day at most finish this before the year is out. It\u2019s just so big, and the big-ness is not optional, as you\u2019ll have to experience it all to get the full scope of the story. Whether this is a healthy way to make games is a debate for another day, but I just thought you might want to know what you\u2019re getting into up front."}

Watch Out For Cosmic Rays : Shots - Health News The dose of radiation an astronaut would experience on a trip to Mars is higher than the annual limit set for workers at nuclear power plants. But Mars enthusiasts say the radiation threat isn't high enough to cancel the trip.\nNASA's Mars rover Curiosity used its Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) to measure radiation exposure on the way to Mars. Now, it's recording similar data on Mars' surface. This image is a composite self portrait taken on Feb. 3, 2013.\nThere was great fanfare when the Mars Science Laboratory launched in November 2011, and again when its precious cargo \u2014 NASA's Mars rover Curiosity \u2014 touched down on the red planet in August 2012.\nThe eight months in between had drama of their own. Curiosity was constantly bombarded with radiation as it traveled through space \u2014 high-energy protons thrown out by the sun, and galactic cosmic rays slicing through the solar system from distant supernovas.\nHere on Earth, the magnetic field and atmosphere shield us from most of this radiation. But out in the void of space, high energy particles would rip into an astronaut's DNA, slowly increasing the risk of cancer.\nThat's a problem for NASA and the handful of private companies that have pledged to send human explorers to Mars. For a long time, they've been trying to figure out just how much radiation an astronaut would experience on the journey.\nEnter Curiosity, which was handily equipped with RAD \u2014 a Radiation Assessment Detector. The monitoring device was intended to gather radiation data on the surface of Mars.\n\"But about two years before launch we started to realize the fact that RAD was tucked inside the belly of the spacecraft sort of in the same location that a future astronaut might be on a future mission,\" says Don Hassler, the physicist who led the Southwest Research Institute team that designed RAD.\nThe researchers reasoned they might as well turn the device on during space flight. A few days after launch, RAD powered up and started collecting data.\nA small portion of the radiation \u2014 about 5 percent \u2014 came from brief but intense solar storms. Astronauts would be able to avoid this source of radiation by retreating to a sheltered area of their ship. Just ducking down inside a room lined with food supplies would do the trick.\nFluctuating solar activity controls radiation in the solar system. The sun produces solar flares, like the one captured in this NASA video, flinging high energy protons and radiation out into the solar system. High solar activity suppresses galactic cosmic rays \u2014 high energy ions cast off by distant supernovas. When solar flares die down, cosmic rays are more prevalent. The solar cycle, from maximum to minimum activity and back again, is approximately 11 years long. Right now, we're approaching a solar maximum.\nThe bulk of the radiation was caused by galactic cosmic rays \u2014 beams of high energy ions that we don't know how to shield against. Hassler says there's really only one way to minimize the damage caused by these rays: \"Go quickly.\"\nThe shortest possible trip to Mars with current technology would take about six months. During that time an astronaut would experience about four times more radiation than someone on the International Space Station.\n\"An astronaut on ISS for, say six months would receive on the order of maybe 80 millisieverts, compared with the 330 we receive on our"}

That's a lot to pack into less than three minutes, but here it happens wordlessly and without compromise, carried to climax by a well-chosen soundtrack.\nThe Rousey and Holm fight goes down Nov. 14 on Pay-Per-View and will mark the seventh consecutive time Rousey's defended her 135-pound title.

(AP) - General manager Reggie McKenzie got rewarded for orchestrating the rebuild of the Oakland Raiders that got them back into the postseason for the first time in 14 years.\nNext up for McKenzie after winning the Pro Football Writers of America Executive of the Year award on Thursday is figuring out how to get the Raiders closer to the franchise\u2019s fourth Super Bowl title.\nMcKenzie has done impressive work since being hired in January 2012 as the team\u2019s first general manager following longtime owner Al Davis\u2019 death. He overhauled the scouting, personnel and football operations, got the team\u2019s salary cap in order and hired Jack Del Rio as coach following a 3-13 record in 2014.\nMcKenzie joined Davis as the only Raiders to win the award. He called it an accomplishment for the whole organization, including current owner Mark Davis who stuck by McKenzie despite an 11-37 record his first three years.\nWith strong draft classes, free agent signings and uncovering productive undrafted free agents, McKenzie put together a roster with an NFL-high seven Pro Bowlers this season led by quarterback Derek Carr, All-Pro edge rusher Khalil Mack, receiver Amari Cooper and three-fifths of the offensive line.\nThat helped the Raiders (12-5) post their best season in 14 years, even if it ended on a down note after Carr broke his right leg in the fourth quarter of a victory in the second-to-last game of the regular season against Indianapolis on Dec. 24.\nOakland lost the following week at Denver with Matt McGloin at quarterback to miss out on winning the AFC West and a first-round bye and then was eliminated from the playoffs with a 27-14 loss at Houston on Jan. 7 behind rookie quarterback Connor Cook.\nThe Raiders have some big questions this offseason starting with the franchise\u2019s home. The team applied Thursday to relocate to Las Vegas, pending approval from 24 of the 32 NFL owners. The Raiders will remain in Oakland for at least the next two seasons under their current lease and McKenzie declined to comment about a possible move.\nAlso on the agenda this offseason are possible contract extensions for Carr and Mack, decisions on whether to retain free agents like running back Latavius Murray and moves to upgrade a defense that struggled to generate consistent pressure on the quarterback and allowed too many big plays.\nThe most expensive moves will be with Carr and Mack. Carr is entering the final year of his rookie deal, while the Raiders have an option for 2018 on Mack. But McKenzie said he doesn\u2019t want to wait too long to lock up those cornerstones even if it does limit salary cap space.\nHelping the cause is McKenzie\u2019s success in finding hidden gems. The team has had several undrafted free agents on the roster the past few years and got 30 of the 47 touchdowns this season from players who were drafted after the fifth round or entered the league as undrafted free agents."}

More than 300 were killed. They were not \u201chere\u201d any more. But weren\u2019t they? Really, they were more present than those alive\u2014more consequential, more potent. For one thing, their commemorative photos were immediately displayed. A larger rally in remembrance of them is scheduled for next week. Spiritually, and even politically\u2014or at that juncture where the spirit and politics meet\u2014they were even more strongly present than the living. They had the strength of martyrs. \"Be happy martyrs, for today we feast at your victory,\" the crowd sang. The first to assume this role prominently was Khaled Said, the young man who had exposed police corruption in a drug deal and then been dragged out of an Internet caf\u00e9 by policemen and beaten to death. An Internet movement called \u201cWe are all Khaled Said\u201d went viral and was one of the precursor events to the revolution. The murder of the 300 people, it may be, was the event that sealed Mubarak\u2019s doom. When people are afraid, murders make them take flight. But when they have thrown off fear, murders have the opposite effect and make them bold. Instead of fear, they feel solidarity. Then they \u201cstay\u201d\u2014and advance. And there is no solidarity like solidarity with the dead. That is the stuff of which revolution is made.\nThe slogan also meant \u201cWe are here.\u201d The here meant the Liberation Square, defended at such a high cost when regime thugs attacked the demonstrators. The Egyptians refused to be fugitives in their own country. That \u201chere\u201d was not only defended, it was cared for, like a garden, as if in acknowledgment that the foundation to be laid was not for a season only. Certain garbage-collection and street-cleaning activities have already been woven into the legend of the revolution. But the here was also Egypt. As one Haisam Abu-Sabra told the Guardian, \"For the first time in my life tonight, I say proudly: I am Egyptian.\u201d Individual courage created collective pride. Individual dignity fed national dignity. The garbage heading for the dumpster\u2014the torture, oppression, corruption and social injustice\u2014was national as well as local. A joke making the rounds during the uprising, as related by the historian of the Middle East Juan Cole, reflected the sense of the wider \u201cwe\u201d and wider \u201chere.\u201d A military man informs Mubarak that his relationship to the Egyptian people must now end. \u201cOh, really,\u201d he responds. \u201cWhere are they going?\u201d It was the latest variation on Bertolt Brecht\u2019s old saying that the rulers were going to dismiss the people and elect another.\nThe widening circles of meaning are even more extensive. Millions throughout the Middle East were rejoicing as if they were Egyptians, and beginning to take action in their own countries, with incalculable consequences. And the repercussions are of course wider still. The long history of nonviolent, democratic movements that began in Southern Europe (Greece, Portugal, Spain) extended to Asia (South Korea, the Philippines) and to Eastern Europe and the great Soviet Union and elsewhere has been no respecter of national boundaries.

The diplomatic damage in the run-up to the war has caused deep divisions between old allies. These rifts were reinforced as nations decided whether to give tangible support to the military operation. Now in the post-conflict phase, disagreements have simmered over the role of international institutions in nation-building in Iraq.\nYet the need for a coherent international approach has rarely been more important. The threat from al-Qaida-linked terrorism has not gone away. The Middle East is still an area of potential conflict. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains a problem, particularly as North Korea abandons international restraints to develop its own nuclear capability. In looking for paths to renewed cooperation between old allies, the European Union and the United Nations both have critical roles to play in helping mend fences. And NATO can take a lead in engaging the key national players as they seek greater security in the world.\nWhen historians look back at the past year, they may conclude that the tactical success in bringing the United Nations into the debate over a war in Iraq was a strategic mistake. The diplomatic process, which eventually achieved a unanimous Security Council vote for UNSCR 1441, encouraged many to believe that the United Nations was in the driving seat for policy towards Iraq. But US President George Bush had also made it clear that he believed: \"The world must move deliberately, decisively to hold Iraq to account. We will work with the UN Security Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted.\"\nThe United States was impatient for decisive action; the United Kingdom wanted UN authority for military action; France and Germany led the call for more time for the inspection process. The attempt to achieve a further resolution to give explicit authority for military action was unsuccessful. Hard bargaining by the United States failed to achieve the necessary nine votes, and, in any event, France made it clear that, if necessary, it would exercise its veto. The United Kingdom and the United States opted to use UNSCR 1441, and previous resolutions on Iraq, as their authority for military action.\nThis failure of diplomacy has had a series of unfortunate consequences. In the United States, antipathy towards the United Nations has increased. In answer to President Bush's question on the future of the United Nations, many in his administration had their beliefs in its irrelevance confirmed. Although unexpectedly countries like Canada and Mexico had taken a tough stand in the Security Council, the anger was directed at France and Germany. Both American and British politicians chose to use anti-French feelings in the run-up to the conflict as a way to deflect public interest from the issue of whether military action was legitimate. Russia has also remained unconvinced by the rush to war. Moreover, questions about the legitimacy of the intervention refuse to go away as the search for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has failed to yield the proverbial \"smoking gun\".\nThe United Nations, nevertheless, has a major role to play in legitimising whatever form of government emerges in Iraq. It must eventually verify that weapons of mass destruction are no longer there. It can draw on its expertise for dealing with humanitarian needs, making the battlefields safe, and encouraging the involvement of non-governmental organisations.

But now that Apple has become a mass-market brand, it\u2019s reaching millions of sensible people, who like to save money. And that, in turn, causes an interesting tension.\nBack when Apple sold widgets, things were easy: you paid through the nose for your widget, and then you were happy. But now Apple makes mobile devices like iPhones and iPads, an that means it has no choice but to get into bed with the much-hated wireless companies. It tries to control the experience as best it can \u2014 but people still end up being faced with ludicrous charges like $30 a month for text messaging. And then, on the perfectly reasonable grounds that $360 plus tax per year is a ridiculous sum of money to spend on a minuscule amount of data, they decide that they\u2019re going to try to get around those charges.\nIt is indeed possible to get around extortionate wireless charges. Rather than buy a 3G iPad, for instance, you can use one with only wifi, and then connect it when you\u2019re on the go to a tethered smartphone or some kind of MiFi device. And rather than spend lots of money on text messages, you can sign up for Google Voice, and do all your texting with that number.\nThese money-saving techniques are perfectly rational. And they don\u2019t cost Apple any money \u2014 just the wireless carriers. But they\u2019re still bad for Apple, because they defeat the elegant perfection which Apple puts so much effort into getting exactly right. And what\u2019s more, these techniques are most attractive to people who are tempted by Apple products but can only just afford them, or can\u2019t quite afford them. As it seeks to increase its market share, Apple has to sell its products to more and more of these people, who will often be buying an Apple product for the first time. And the last thing that Apple wants is for its carefully-crafted user experience to be sullied by something as banal as an attempt to avoid text-messaging charges.\nTake the iPad, for instance: I can attest from personal experience that the 3G iPad is just miles better than trying to use a wifi-only iPad with a MiFi. It downloads emails automatically, even when you don\u2019t ask it to; you can pull it out of your bag and look up anything you like instantly; there\u2019s no waiting around for the wireless modem to get online and generate its wifi signal; you don\u2019t need to worry about how charged up your MiFi is, or where you left it; you get all the advantages of real GPS; etc etc. An iPad + MiFi is adequate; it\u2019s good enough; it\u2019s \u201call I need\u201d. But the 3G iPad is why people love Apple. And it costs $300 a year over and above the cost of the iPad, which is itself $130 more than the wifi-only version. There are definitely cheaper ways of getting your iPad online. But you lose a significant amount of elegance and ease of use in the process.\nAs for Google Voice, you can either just install it on your phone with a new number, or you can go through the rather convoluted process of transferring your current number to Google Voice.

They include Nikole Flax, who was chief of staff to Steven Miller, the interim IRS commissioner that President Obama forced out when the controversy broke.\nThe IRS said it checked for computer problems between September 2009 and February 2014.\nIn a memo sent to Congress, the agency said that the number of staffers losing emails was roughly in line with the 5 percent to 6 percent failure rate for new computer equipment.\nIt also said that it had recovered roughly 14,000 emails for the five staffers, generally by cross-checking other officials\u2019s accounts.\nThe agency has told lawmakers that it found around 24,000 of Lerner\u2019s missing emails through a similar process. Lerner, who once headed an IRS division overseeing tax-exempt groups, became the first agency official to acknowledge the IRS\u2019s improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups in May 2013. She has since been held in contempt of Congress and has been referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.\nBesides Kindell, the IRS said Friday that two other Washington-based staffers, Justin Lowe and Ron Shoemaker, likely lost emails as well. Julie Chen and Nancy Heagney, who handled tax-exempt applications in the agency\u2019s Cincinnati office, round out the five staffers identified by the agency.\nThe IRS has said that it only allowed staffers to keep a limited number of emails in their inbox, with the rest needing to be backed up on a hard drive. Before last year, the agency also routinely recycled tapes backing up emails after six months, leading to the loss of some staffers\u2019 emails.\nBut Republicans have repeatedly said they don\u2019t buy that explanation, hauling the IRS commissioner, John Koskinen, up to Capitol Hill multiple times this summer for testimony. GOP lawmakers have also raised concerns that the IRS wiped clean Lerner\u2019s Blackberry in 2012, after congressional investigators began asking her about Tea Party cases.\nIssa said Friday's letter showed once more that the IRS wasn't being straight with Congress, and pushed again for the Obama administration to appoint a special prosecutor.\n\"The so-called 'most transparent administration in history' has given Congress incons"}

But what warms the heart or initiates debate can be a matter of perspective in a sprawling event that brings together more than 200 nations and territories.\nThere was little division on Tuesday in the Olympic Stadium, when two runners \u2014 Abbey D\u2019Agostino of the United States and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand \u2014 offered a helping hand to each other after a collision in the 5,000 meters and then urged each other on to the finish.\n\u201cI mean, that girl is the Olympic spirit right there,\u201d Hamblin said afterward, speaking to reporters about D\u2019Agostino.\nBut on Sunday in the women\u2019s marathon, when the German twins and training partners Anna and Lisa Hahner decided \u2014 spontaneously, they insist \u2014 to join hands as they crossed the finish line deep in the pack and far from the medals, they quickly drew sharp criticism.\nThis is not just a German point of view, of course, but it does reflect the range of expectations as athletes navigate the cultural norms that relate to competition and sportsmanship.\nThe Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby, who refused to shake the hand of his Israeli opponent Or Sasson, was following his nation\u2019s standards \u2014 one that Olympic officials expressly reject. He was ejected from the Games.\nThere was no outcry, only amusement, when David Katoatau, an exuberant weight lifter from Kiribati, danced off stage on Monday with the goal of heightening awareness of the threat posed by climate change to his tiny nation in the central Pacific Ocean.\nThe Hahner twins had no political agenda when they joined hands to end their race, but their move, to their surprise, was still polarizing.\nThat approach, according to Kurschilgen, is what divides elite sport from mass-participation sport and what he thinks the Hahners failed to grasp.\nThe twins, who placed 81st and 82nd in the marathon, do not see it that way. Contacted on Monday, they initially declined to speak, but Anna Hahner later sent an email in which she said they had not planned on finishing hand-in-hand and had done their best individually.\nAnna said she started faster, and then Lisa\u2019s group caught up with her at around the 17-kilometer mark, at which point Anna said they ran about three kilometers together.\nAnd yet the sisters were well short of their best marathon performances. Anna\u2019s personal best in the marathon is 2 hours 26 minutes 44 seconds. Lisa\u2019s is 2:28.39.

{"idx": "11808", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Mark Rabkin VP of Core Ads at Facebook revealed a few tips and tricks for advertising in the mobile era. Rabkin pointed out that a mobile phone should not be classified as a tiny TV, just as TV wasn\u2019t visual radio and radio wasn\u2019t an audible newspaper. The company suggests that mobile must be recognized for what it is: a new medium that demands new content grounded in experiences that are native to the platform like speed, choice and relevance.\nFacebook tracked the activity of 537 people who said they watched the season premiere of a popular TV show. During every commercial break, their use of Facebook went up.\nThe big difference between viewing content on a smartphone V.S. television is the freedom. Smartphones are not limited to a room and a power outlet, but instead are free to go wherever its owner travels, and often do. Additionally, people are in full control of what they see, where and when they want to see it. And they\u2019re exercising that ability at all times. Mobile has trained people to choose what\u2019s relevant to them, consume what matters to them and move on.\nAccording to Rabkin, people scroll through mobile News Feed 41% faster than desktop News Feed. And when videos start to autoplay on Facebook people watch them for 16.7 seconds on average. This is similar with video ads, which are watched in News Feed for 5.7 seconds on average.\nIt makes sense that because people can watch virtually anything at any time, they\u2019re only going to watch ads that grab their attention, reward their time.\nSo in a new mobile era what\u2019s the best way forward for mobile video ads? How can advertisers take charge of the complexity of this new, fragmented space? Facebook points to some of its most successful advertisers on its site, Nestle to AirBnb to Ubisoft, for examples.\nBuild brand new, short-form, mobile creative. Ensure the video rewards people\u2019s attention and tells its story even if only the first few seconds are watched. Use mobile native tools, techniques, and styles to echo the organic content people like to see.\nRe-organize to test and measure ads on a weekly cycle, not every 6 months. Build organizations that can deliver quality creative inexpensively and on short notice. Align creative, measurement, and media teams to connect and work together as a single team. This can be a formidable challenge, but mobile is evolving too quickly for a traditional, fragmented approach to work well.\nDon\u2019t try to equate disparate platforms. Each new mobile format (e.g. News Feed, Stories, Ad Breaks, TrueView) has different consumer expectations and behaviors. Be careful of false equivalences or standards between them that can blind your organization to their unique nature. For example, a guaranteed 10 second ad break requires different creative than a video in a feed that may be seen for 6 seconds by the average person, but for 30 seconds by 10% of the audience. Facebook isn\u2019t YouTube, YouTube isn\u2019t Search, Search isn\u2019t Snapchat.\nMeasure results, not seconds. It\u2019s true that this new world is complex, but it\u2019s worth the investment to map it. To do this digital reconnaissance, it\u2019s crucial to measure business value and results on a per-creative, per-platform, per-audience basis. An advertiser\u2019s ability to measure the right things properly will be the biggest predictor of their mobile advertising success.\nTransparency is paramount. To create fantastic new stories for the complex landscape of mobile formats, marketers must understand every nuance of consumer behavior, with detailed insights provided"}

However, she sought to reassure consumers that the Echo Dot Kids Edition device and its companion FreeTime service comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act.\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal heightened awareness of technology companies\u2019 data collection practices and created public backlash. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent 10 hours testifying before Congress about how the now-bankrupt political consulting firm gained access to the personal information about 87 million users, in its efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\nLast month, nearly two dozen child advocacy and watchdog groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google for allegedly violating children\u2019s privacy laws with its YouTube video service.\nThe lawmakers asked Bezos to provide details about whether Amazon records and saves children\u2019s interactions with the device and if these conversations are converted to text and stored. They want to know if parents can review and delete these recordings, or any other information Amazon collects along the way.\nMarkey and Barton ask if Amazon is building a profile or \u201cvoiceprint\u201d of each child who uses the Echo Dot Kids Edition and how long Amazon holds on to this information if a parent doesn\u2019t delete it. They want to know what third parties have access to this data, and whether it\u2019s used for marketing purposes.\nThe legislators also ask what steps Amazon has taken to comply with the parental consent requirements of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act.\nAmazon said that during setup, the Alexa app asks for parental approval and provides information about the privacy and security of their children\u2019s voice recordings. Parents can access all their children\u2019s voice recordings in the Alexa app, and delete them individually or all at once, which also deletes them from the Amazon server.\nFreeTime on Alexa voice recordings are only used for delivering and improving the Alexa voice service and FreeTime service\u2014they are not used for advertising or Amazon.com product recommendations, the spokesperson said. Amazon does not share audio recordings with developers, who are prohibited from collecting personal information.\nCustomers can press the mute button on the top of the device, which electrically disconnects the microphones.

Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.\nOne U.S. official said that Sessions - who testified that he has no recollection of the April encounter - has provided \"misleading\" statements that are \"contradicted by other evidence.\" A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had \"substantive\" discussions on matters including Trump's positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.\nSessions has said repeatedly that he never discussed campaign-related issues with Russian officials and that it was only in his capacity as a U.S. Senator that he met with Kislyak.\n\"I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,\" Sessions said in March when he announced that he would recuse himself from matters relating to the FBI probe of Russian interference in the election and any connections to the Trump campaign.\nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that assertion is at odds with Kislyak's accounts of conversations during two encounters over the course of the campaign, one in April ahead of Trump's first major foreign policy speech and another in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.\nThe apparent discrepancy could pose new problems for Sessions at a time when his position in the administration appears increasingly tenuous.\nTrump, in an interview this week, expressed frustration with Sessions's recusing himself from the Russia probe and indicated that he regretted his decision to make the lawmaker from Alabama the nation's top law enforcement officer. Trump also faulted Sessions as giving \"bad answers\" during his confirmation hearing about his Russian contacts during the campaign.\nOfficials emphasized that the information contradicting Sessions comes from U.S. intelligence on Kislyak's communications with the Kremlin, and acknowledged that the Russian ambassador could have mischaracterized or exaggerated the nature of his interactions.\n\"Obviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me,\" said Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman in a statement. She reiterated that Sessions did not discuss interference in the election.\nRussian and other foreign diplomats in Washington and elsewhere have been known, at times, to report false or misleading information to bolster their standing with their superiors or to confuse U.S. intelligence agencies.\nBut U.S. officials with regular access to Russian intelligence reports say Kislyak - whose tenure as ambassador to the United States ended recently - has a reputation for accurately relaying details about his interactions with officials in Washington.\nSessions removed himself from direct involvement in the Russia investigation after it was revealed in The Washington Post that he had met with"}

But eventually, he starts to suspect that creepy neighbor David Morse is a serial killer, and he, buddy Aaron Yoo, and Roemer launch their own Spy Kids investigation.\nThe setup takes far too long, at least for viewers who aren't the exact right age to harmonize with LaBeouf's well-acted yet not terribly compelling \"Life's sooo unfair\" teen angst. But once the plot finally kicks into gear, director D.J. Caruso (Taking Lives) effectively cranks up the tension, via tricks yanked from the Hitchcock and Blair Witch Project playbooks.

Perhaps most telling is Roemer's romantic interest in LaBeouf, which comes after she learns he's been spying on her; in the era of MySpace and YouTube video blogs, the film implies, everyone is so open that only an obsessive stalker has enough interest and access to uncover actual intimate truths, whether they're about his crush object or a psycho killer."}

The number of councils booking care workers for these \u201cflying care\u201d visits has shot up 5 percent in the past year.\nCouncils warn crippling funding cuts are to blame for the situation, and have jeopardized their capacity to maintain basic services.

At the forefront of Ukrainians' objections to the government are a special police force known as the Berkut, or \"Golden Eagle.\"\nDuring the Euromaidan Protests, Yanukovych has deployed up to 5,000 members of the Berkut to assist in protest management, including the use of water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Rather than quelling the disturbances, the Berkut has fanned the flames, using increasingly brutal measures to fight protesters.\nThe Berkut are a special police force that has had a long history of brutality, abuse, torture, and other measures in service of whatever political regime is in control of Ukraine. The force was first formed in 1988 as part of the Soviet OMON (Special Purpose Police Unit), an elite riot police and paramilitary force.\nIn 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the force reformed as the Berkut under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was stationed in every province. Originally established to fight organized crime, the force has been increasingly utilized to maintain law and order and break up \"mass events,\" such as riots and protests.\nSince their inception, they have been involved in numerous scandals, including violently dispersing peacefully protesting coal miners in 1998, violently attacking protesters during the Ukraine Without Kuchma protests in 2001, as well as sadistically attacking protesters during the current Euromaidan protests.\nBerkut members are carefully selected and trained extensively. Prior to joining, Berkut men must have army service, as well as two to three years of law enforcement experience. They are usually paid between one and half to two times more than a regular police officer.\nBerkut officers clash with anti-government protesters in Vinnytsia, 125 miles southwest of Kiev.\nThe semi-autonomous Berkut police often act with impunity for their actions, leading some to call them a \"mafia-style organization.\" Some efforts have been made over the years to rein in Berkut power, most notably by Yuriy Lutsenko (now an opposition leader) under President Viktor Yushchenko. Lutsenko set up human rights experts and oversight groups to monitor the activities of the Berkut and other members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nWhen current President Yanukovych came to power, these measures were rolled back. Yanukovych appointed a close ally to run the MIA and, since, the Berkut has upped its brutality.\nBerkut police officers hold a man lying on the ground during clashes between police and pro-European protesters in Kiev.\nThe Euromaidan Protests may have started over a trade agreement dispute, but it's end could hinge on serious reform of the country's most brutal police force."}

{"idx": "11836", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The saga of oil price rise goes back to October 6, 1973 when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat decided to restore the self-esteem of his armed forces and the nation by launching the Yom Kippur war. Today is the 45th anniversary of that event.\nRising oil price: India is reeling under its economic and political ramifications.\nForty five years ago, most of us never thought twice about filling the fuel tanks of our vehicles. A full tank of my Vespa scooter cost me Rs 6. My parents' Ambassador car needed Rs 50 to be brimful. Fuel was the last of our worries and we consumed it as if the good times would never end. They did, on October 6, 1973, the day of Yom Kippur, the holy day of atonement of sins by the Jews. President Anwar Sadat of Egypt launched one of the best ever conceived, planned and coordinated military offensives in history, into his own territory. That territory was then held by Israelis along the Suez Canal front with the entire Sinai under them, having captured it in the lightning offensive of the Six Day War of June 1967. That Sadat's offensive floundered at the altar of execution, the bane of the planner, is a different story. Importantly, it upset the breeze of a life we lived in those times. Prices of fuel shot up and very soon my scooter's full tank was costing me Rs17; that's an increase of three and a half times almost overnight. Imagine if petrol were to suddenly cost you Rs 275 a litre! A heart-stopping development for most of us.\nWhat's the connection between Sadat's Yom Kippur war of October, 1973 and oil prices? That's what I will endeavour to explain in brief.\nThe Yom Kippur war: The conflict itself is one of the most studied and analysed conflicts of the Cold War period. It stood out for three things in terms of military technology. One, the first serious use of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) in the mechanised battlefield, the SS 11B1 and the shoulder fired Malutka of the Soviet family and the American TOW (developed in 1970) which worsted the Israeli, Egyptian and Syrian armoured assaults in the war. Two, was the use of Surface to Air Guided missiles (SAM6 and shoulder fired SAM7, again of the Soviet family). The third was the first demonstrated employment of the T-72 tank and the BMP-1, both iconic combat vehicles of the Soviet era.\nAnwar Sadat put together a beguiling plan to deceive the ever-prepared Israeli armed forces and achieved almost total surprise. A young Egyptian military engineer developed a method of hosing down the high banks of the Suez Canal to provide access to Egyptian bridging and mechanised war fighting material even as hordes of Egyptian infantrymen with ATGMs went rushing across the canal and fanned into the desert to take on the Israeli armoured counter-attacks. SAM launchers were also rushed over the bridges to their pre-designated sites and kept at bay the attacking Israeli air force, thus creating a 10-km air defence umbrella. Despite the early success, the Egyptians floundered as the plan desisted from further ingress, diluting into a defensive holding action with the canal behind the Egyptians. In the end, the Egyptians were"}

Neighbors say the proposed construction threatens to worsen erosion on the riverbank, causing runoff to public drinking supplies downstream. In addition, residents said they are concerned about the home's septic system, which would be within 100 feet of the river, an area regulated by the city Environmental Protection Board.\nPart of the issue stems from the fact that the home would be located on a steep incline, necessitating the removal of trees and the installation of a retaining wall on the property, the neighbors said.\n\"It's awful close to the river and that river is drinking water supply for the town of Greenwich,\" Highline Trail homeowner Budd Tunick said. \"And we're afraid that the runoff, the possibility of cutting down anywhere from 40 to 120 trees on a very steep slope, is going to compromise the soil there.\"\nHoping to halt the project, 47 neighbors filed a petition for a public hearing with the EPB. The board granted the request, with a hearing scheduled for Thursday evening.\nEnvironmental Analyst Pamela Fausty, a staff member for the EPB, said although the home would not sit within the 100-foot \"buffer\" zone, parts of the development do encroach on regulated areas, including portions of the septic system and retaining wall, which are about 60 feet from the river. The land is owned by the Judith R. George Trust.\nThe project's surveyor, Rocco V. D'Andrea Inc., referred questions to the firm's lawyer, Joseph Capalbo, who did not return a call by press time Wednesday.\nDiane Lauricella, an environmental consultant who is working with neighbors, said the land should be protected because of its close proximity to Mianus River Park, which lies both across the river and to the south; and to the Treetops Estate, a 105-acre parcel owned by the state Department of Environmental Protection and maintained by the Stamford Land Conservation Trust and Greenwich Land Trust.\nThe property also contains a hiking trail along the riverbank that connects parts of Mianus River Park, she said.\n\"This is part of a wildlife corridor up the east side of the Mianus River,\" Lauricella said. \"This has already been deemed a very special natural resource area. It is contiguous with Mianus River Park.\"\n\"It really has a lot to do with the quality of life, the need to not harm the drinking water supply and preserving the open space ecosystem,\" Lauricella added.\nLauricella said nearby homeowners hope to convince the site's owner to donate the land as open space rather than develop the property, a move that would entitle the owner to a tax benefit.\nMarina Shrady, who lives next to the lot where the home is proposed, said she was assured when she bought the property the land would never be developed. She said she has walked her dog along the river for more than 10 years, and has already noticed problems with erosion in the area, which she fears will worsen if construction is allowed to move forward.\n\"Every time I take walks down there, there is another tree down because of the banks being eroded,\" Shrady said. \"I just feel that it will weaken the"}

{"idx": "11846", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Over the course of the last few years, we have seen Hollywood bring a darker edge to some classic children's tales. In 2016, Jon Favreau and Disney did that with The Jungle Book, but we've only scratched the surface of the maturity of that particular universe. On that note, a trailer for Andy Serkis' Mowgli has officially debuted online, and the preview promises nothing less than a brooding and mature take on the beloved story by Rudyard Kipling. Check out the trailer for the upcoming PG-13 Warner Bros. film, below.\nSo, this most certainly is not your childhood take on The Jungle Book narrative. Based on that footage, it looks like Mowgli is going to lean hard into the titular hero's origins with the wolves and his guidance under the tutelage of Bagheera (Christian Bale). The footage shown in that trailer shows Mowgli going on some wild adventures, with a very mature and hard-hitting take on the action and violence. Also worth noting is the menace that Benedict Cumberbatch brings to the table as Shere Khan, who arguably seems even more scarred and monstrous than the version portrayed by Idris Elba in Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book from 2016.\nAnother thing worth paying attention to in this trailer for Mowgli is the strength of the CGI work. The landscapes are sweeping and exotic, and the mo-cap performances of the animals look absolutely brilliant. This should come as no surprise, as director Andy Serkis has become one of the most well-established and beloved mo-cap actors currently working today. He has proven time and time again that he knows how to deliver fantastic computer-generated performances with his roles in projects like War for the Planet of the Apes and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Mowgli looks no different. That said, considering how new he is to the realm of directing, the fact that Mowgli seems as polished as it does is something to behold.\nDespite the increased maturity and emphasis on darker themes, what we know about Mowgli indicates that it will generally line up with the arc of the classic story. Specifically, Mowgli will focus on the young boy's journey through the jungle as he learns to survive under the guidance of Bagheera and the lovable and wise bear known as Baloo (Andy Serkis, because of course he's getting in on the mo-cap action). Along the way, the boy will find himself chased by a variety of vicious and deadly animals as he gradually learns the tragic truth behind his past with the humans and finds a place for himself between humankind and the animal kingdom.\nMowgli will premiere in theaters later this year on October 19, 2018. Make sure to catch the latest adaptation of The Jungle Book when it finally debuts, and while you're at it, head over to Cinemablend's movie premiere guide to see what other films 2018 has in store!"}

They went close on several occasions and Salgaocar made them pay with two goals in added time through Gilbert Oliveira and man of the match Darryl Duffy in the sixth and eighth minute, respectively, of added time.\nDempo started with the right intent and had the first look in the third minute itself but a long ranger from Rowilson Rodrigues was parried away by goalkeeper Karanjit Singh.

In the eighth minute, there was another chance when the ball was pushed towards the Salgaocar goal but Peter Carvalho's header was cleared by the defenders.\nSalgaocar took some time to get into the groove and it was not until the 14th minute that they had their first chance. Duffy split the rival defence with a through ball that Umesh Harijan tried to finish off but Dempo goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani proved equal to the task.\nDempo were not to be left behind and Tolgay was proving to be a thorn in the flesh. First he found Alwyn, who ended up with a feeble attempt, and a few minutes later, his own shot was brilliantly saved by the goalkeeper.\nEven though Dempo were dominating play, Salgaocar had another chance, again for Harijan but the youngster, playing only his second I-League match, missed the shot completely.\nTowards the closing stages of the first half, Karanjit almost gifted Dempo the goal, until Zambian defender Francis Kasonde rushed to his team's rescue.\nThe agony for Dempo continued when in the 41st minute Tolgay dribbled past a clutch of defenders and took a shot at the goal but the ball hit the post and went out of play.\nThe second half started just the way the first ended. Tolgay (57th) found himself with only the goalkeeper to beat but his shot hit the custodian's leg and went past the goalpost.\nRegular goalkeeper Karanjit had to be replaced for Salgaocar after suffering an injury and his place was duly taken by Subrata Paul. The India captain was called into action and was on hand to effect big saves towards the closing stages. First he put away Uttam Rai's shot but he was at his best when he denied Francis Fernandes with just eight minutes left.\nThere was drama when eight minutes of added time were shown. Dempo attacked relentlessly and Salgaocar defended stoutly, and out of nowhere Salgaocar scored, twice!

Anyone with a taste for fashion (myself included) has long been taking note of her consistently chic outfits \u2014 from her trove of sharply cut, form-fitting dresses and wide-collar twill coats, to her collection of power blazers and no-nonsense shoes (including versatile flats).\nMarkle\u2019s looks are on our radar in part because, as Vanessa Valiente, a personal stylist and creator of V-Style, a fashion and travel blog points out, \u201cshe\u2019s giving royal style some edge,\u201d but also because they\u2019re not that difficult to imitate.\n\u201cThere is a strength and versatility to her look [that] is actually very easy to copy on a budget,\u201d says Valiente.\nTaking this a step further, when you consider that historically maternity wardrobes haven\u2019t exactly screamed glamour, it\u2019s exciting to see a celebrity of such regal stature show off her baby bump in show-stealing looks.\nSuch inspiration is evident when you consider just how much people are searching for Markle\u2019s maternity looks online.\nAccording to SEMrush, a trends data provider, the number of search queries around Meghan Markle's maternity style increased by 554 percent since October 2018, detecting a strong correlation between searches for Meghan Markle maternity style and her ASOS maternity dress, which surged in search by 68.6 percent since she was first seen wearing it.\nLove the Sales has been cataloging Meghan Markle's maternity wear (amassing 75 outfits so far) and notes that searches for brands she wore soared on their site as well. For instance, Karen Gee (who designed the white sheath dress Markle donned in October) saw a search performance boost of 5,800 percent. Outland Denim, which makes sustainable jeans that Markle has worn out and about, saw a search spike by 3,900 percent since Markle started wearing them.\nSo, here\u2019s the catch: while Markle does sport the occasional fast fashion dress that won\u2019t break the bank, the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wardrobe is overall, really expensive. Like, you could buy a house with this money.\nThese hefty price tags seem to contradict the idea that any woman can copy Markle, but keep in mind that save for the fancy galas, most of Markle\u2019s outfits aren\u2019t that dramatic, meaning they\u2019re easy to mimic on a budget.\nValiente recommends shopping on Hatch (Markle has sported at least one maternity dress from this brand) when the site has a sale.\n\u201cShe lets the clothes (and the impeccable fit) speak for themselves.

The update was released late last week, and will likely allow multiplayer games to make use of a stronger online service to host better quality matchmaking and gameplayer performance in an online setting.\nSteam has recently come under fire for some of its policies, especially those related to the platform's content curation system. With a bonafide competitor in the Epic Games Store beginning to entice developers way from Valve's digital distribution service, many have called for Steam to begin making some serious policy changes to compete.

The company needs to rework its image a little after some recent controversies, and the Epic Games Store has continued to push developer incentives as a big draw to that platform over Steam.

In the cases of Maryborough, Ballarat and Bendigo, one such display was the stately grandstands built at the town's main sporting venues. A century later, we can all be grateful.\nThe Bendigo stand was built in 1901, in time for the Ashes cricket tour of that summer. Using bricks and ironwork cast by a renowned local foundry, the workmanship was superb. But besides the robust display of confidence by the city burghers, possibly the stand's greatest achievement was its nod to the common man.\nThe late Bendigo historian Frank Cusack wrote that the grandstand was a striking expression, in bricks and mortar, of the egalitarianism that animated Australian politics around the time of Federation. Boot-makers and street-sweepers could watch the game alongside councillors and engineers. It was a far cry from members' enclosures at racetracks.\nJim Evans, president of the Bendigo Historical Society, this week took The Age through a short history of the grandstand and the ground that was known as the Upper Reserve before being renamed the Queen Elizabeth Oval. He confirmed that the grandstand was a statement of prosperity but he was unwilling to sit on its wooden seats.\nOn a cold day, he said, the stand failed to offer protection against the wind. While a lonely teenager listened to his Walkman in the grandstand, Evans explained that the louvres at the back of the stand ensured a draught. \"They were put there to make sure there was a breeze during hot days at the cricket,\" he said.\nThe best alternative was to sit in a brick dugout on the boundary line. Behind the dugout were the grandstand and the charming wooden press box. Ahead was a view over the oval towards the elms and peppercorns that lower over the wooden shelter on the far wing.\nBehind the city-end goals is the caretaker's house. In the 1950s, the caretaker would place a big radio on his veranda during Bendigo Football League games to enable spectators to hear the races from Melbourne.\nBefore each race, spectators would bet with the SP bookie, then crowd against the caretaker's fence, cocking their ears.\nThe 1950s are widely considered the golden age of Bendigo football. In the days before car ownership and television began diverting attention to Melbourne, the Bendigo grandstand would heave and crowds would pack six and seven-deep to watch heroes such as Noel McMahen, a Melbourne premiership captain who went to Rochester.\nIn 1955, spectators saw arguably Bendigo's greatest individual performance in the grand final between the QEO co-tenants, Sandhurst and South Bendigo. Kevin Curran, a former war hero and Hawthorn captain, was playing-coach at Sandhurst. South Bendigo burst ahead early and led by nine goals to one at half-time.\nTeeming rain seemed to rule out Sandhurst's chance before Curran imposed his will on the game. Like a bullock dragging a stump, he hauled the Dragons within sight of victory before South Bendigo held on to win by a point. In the grand final two years later, Eaglehawk defeated Kyneton by five goals before 16,600, an attendance that remains the record.\n"}

There are always going to be unfortunate examples of families being separated and painful events in immigrant communities, but administrative solutions are not feasible or do-able on a large scale, she said.\n\"At end of day we feel the answer to this problem is a legislative answer, and we are working every day to reach the day when the president can sign an immigration reform that can fix this problem,\" Munoz said.\nThe issue of children who are U.S. citizens being separated from parents has come into sharper focus in recent weeks after a young New York girl was forced to leave the country with her grandfather.\nThey had been in Guatemala and were returning when the grandfather was detained at an airport and denied entry to the United States because of a decades-old violation on his record. Her parents were waiting for the 4-year-old in New York, but she was made to leave rather than be united with her parents. She recently was reunited with her parents.\nRep.

But the project will update the 32 decaying bridges and pavement, and bring the interchange up to modern standards for construction and safety.\nThe plan will head into a 30-day public response period before a preliminary design is created. The public can offer input from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Oct. 10 at INDOT's open house, at Arsenal Tech High School, 1500 E. Michigan St.\nINDOT's initial proposal to fix the North Split was opposed by the Rethink 65/70 Coalition, made up of 50 neighborhood groups, citizens, business and civic organizations.Young & Laramore CEO Paul Knapp said the \"massive project\" would \"define Downtown Indianapolis for generations.\"\nIn a statement, Rethink 65/70 noted its members are \"cautiously optimistic about INDOT\u2019s revised plans.\"\nThe new option was one of five INDOT looked at. The project is estimated to cost $225 to $275 million, and is different than the first plan it released about a year ago. The initial plan included more lanes, widening bridges and adding 25-feet concrete walls known as \"mechanically stabilized earth\" walls on the same footprint.\n\"This preliminary design is a testament to the legitimate concerns of Indianapolis neighborhoods who have felt the generational impact of the urban interstate system, and INDOT\u2019s genuine willingness to listen and ensure their plans reflected that feedback,\" Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement. \"Residents should be encouraged by this kind of collaboration, and we can be proud of the initial plans it has resulted in.\"\nThe newest version of INDOT's plan eliminates the \"weaving patterns\" that cause many of the split's 300 accidents a year, INDOT's Strategic Communications Director Scott Manning said.\n\"The public input process certainly played a significant role,\" Manning said. \"Consistently the heard message we heard from neighborhood groups was that they really had a strong desire to not see the footprint widened.\"\nRethink 65/70 said INDOT's plan seems to meet their concerns, which included not expanding lanes, or adding above-grade walls.\nThe preliminary design process is expected to begin in 2019, and construction in 2020."}

State if the Wolfpack can find some level of consistency after its stirring 17-16 upset of the third-ranked Seminoles on Saturday. The Seminoles have the upper hand on the Tigers for now by virtue of their 49-37 win over Clemson on Sept. 22 in Tallahassee, Fla.\nVirginia Tech\ufffds home contest with Duke this week all of a sudden looks dangerous, with the Blue Devils at 5-1 overall and 2-0 in the ACC after a 42-17 thrashing of Virginia. Miami leads an ACC Coastal Division lacking a clear-cut favorite.\nWith all these happenings in mind, let\ufffds take a look at what to expect leading up to the Dec. 1 ACC championship game at Charlotte\ufffds Bank of America Stadium.\nThe favorite: Florida State, by already having beaten Clemson, is still in a strong position, particularly with future opponent Virginia Tech struggling. But it won\ufffdt be easy for the Seminoles, who have to regain their early-season momentum if they want to excel down the stretch.\nThe dark horse: Only Duke can be 5-1 coming off a 25-point conference win and still be installed as a 10-point underdog against a divisional favorite (Hokies) that has a pair of non-conference losses and lost 48-34 in its first league road game (at UNC).

That\ufffds saying a lot, though, for a group yielding 33 points and more than 500 yards per ACC game.

State followed up its frustrating 44-37 loss at Miami with the win against Florida State, complete with a trio of fourth-down conversions \ufffd the final one a 2-yard TD pass from Mike Glennon to Bryan Underwood \ufffd on its winning drive. Will the Pack build on the momentum and make a late-season run or revert to its trend of winning spotlight games and losing the ones in between?\nCoastal up for grabs: Miami has the lead in the ACC Coastal with a 3-0 league mark, but Virginia Tech still lurks if it can recover from a 3-3 start (1-1 in ACC). North Carolina showed its strength in a 48-34 win against the Hokies and could win the division if it keeps up that pace.

Mental illness and substance use have been found to be the main reason for their hospitalizations.\nA homeless individual is one who lacks fixed and reliable housing, and it is estimated that 553,000 people fit that description on any given night in the United States. A new retrospective cohort study by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center examines patterns, causes and outcomes of acute hospitalizations between 2007 and 2013 for homeless individuals and non-homeless control groups in three populous and diverse U.S. states: Florida, California, and Massachusetts.\nData suggest a rise in acute hospital use among homeless individuals for mental illness and substance use disorder. The results were published in the journal Medical Care on Dec. 11.\n\"The homeless population is aging, and the rate of hospitalizations for homeless individuals is increasing,\" said lead author Rishi Wadhera, MD, cardiology fellow in the Cardiovascular Division at the Brigham and health policy researcher at BIDMC. \"Although there has been a recent push to establish better policy and public health measures to improve the health of homeless adults, few studies have examined the patterns and causes of hospitalizations in this population. We found that hospitalizations among homeless adults tend to be for a very different set of conditions than non-homeless adults, even after accounting for differences in demographics.\"\nTo examine these trends, hospital discharge data was acquired from Massachusetts and Florida between 2001 and 2013 and from California between 2007 and 2011. This information came from the State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, created by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This dataset includes information such as homeless status, billing, demographics, and diagnoses. Hospitalization costs were determined by applying American Hospital Association cost-to-charge ratios to the total hospital charges provided in the SID.\nOverall, the researchers analyzed 185,292 hospitalizations for homeless individuals and 32,322,569 hospitalizations for non-homeless individuals. Between 2007 to 2013 (2011 for Calif.), acute hospitalizations for homeless individuals increased in all three states. Massachusetts experienced an increase from 294 to 420 per 1000 homeless residents.\nFlorida increased from 161 to 240/1,000, and California grew from 133 to 164/1,000. Homeless adults were more often white (62 percent), male (76.1 percent), around 46 years old, and either uninsured (41.9 percent) or insured by Medicaid (31.7 percent).\nThe researchers found that reasons for hospitalization among the two groups differed starkly. More than 50 fifty percent of hospitalizations among homeless individuals were for mental illness and substance use disorder, while these conditions explained less than 20 percent of hospitalizations among demographically comparable non-homeless individuals.\nHomeless adults also had a longer mean length of stay (6.5 vs. 5.9 days). However, homeless individuals had lower in-hospital mortality rates (0.9 percent vs. 1.2 percent) and lower mean costs per day ($1,535 vs. $1,834) than the comparable non-homeless control group.\n\"Some states, such as Massachusetts, have expanded"}

The first one was met with strong criticism (even from his own party members), but the latter was accepted by all and sundry without even a proviso. Everyone lives happily ever since.\nJust when the madrassa elite was harassing Pervez Rasheed and his own party leaders and ministers had left him alone to deal with it, Islamabad Police was hunting the people who were putting up highly inflammatory banners and posters full of hatred and incitement to violence against Pervez Rasheed.

But so much work remains to be done to verify that the vehicle is safe to fly that any delays will mean the shuttle will miss its May launch window entirely, and will have to wait until at least July.\nThe biggest engineering hurdles left to overcome are tests to ensure that two protective ramps \u2013 designed to smooth the airflow over a cable tray on the external fuel tank \u2013 can be removed without causing the underlying cables to break free from the tank on take-off. A 0.45-kilogram (1 pound) piece of foam fell from one of the protuberance air load (PAL) ramps during the last shuttle flight\u2019s launch, in July 2005.\nFortunately, it did not strike the orbiter, but mission managers want to prevent such large pieces of foam from coming off the tank. They want to ensure that any pieces of foam shed from the tank are smaller than 1 ounce (28 grams) \u2013about the size of a matchbook. That should make any falling foam too small to punch a hole in the orbiter, an event that caused the shuttle Columbia to break up on atmospheric re-entry in 2003.\nEngineers will begin a series of wind tunnel tests in several weeks to check the strength of shock waves created around fittings where the PAL ramp used to be, shuttle programme manager Wayne Hale told reporters on Tuesday. These will also determine if the cables are strong enough to withstand the shocks.\nAn additional task for engineers is to determine the risk of flying with a small sliver of metal, about 1 millimatre in size, that has become trapped inside a screen that filters out debris from a liquid oxygen tank on the main engine. Attempts to remove it have so far failed.\nThe tiny shard could potentially get clogged in a moving part or coolant line in the engine. And depending on the type of metal it is \u2013 this is currently unknown \u2013 it could actually ignite in the pure oxygen environment. Engineers are now running tests at a New Mexico facility to determine the risk to flight.\nIf flying with the shard is decided to be too risky, NASA will remove the screen and clean it. But that could actually introduce more contamination into the screen, says Hale, so engineers will have to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of such a procedure.\nSuch analysis means engineers will \u201crun right down to the wire, whatever the launch date turns out to be\u201d, says Hale. He has requested shuttle managers consider a launch on 10 May and will discuss their reaction to that date in a closed meeting on Thursday. The full launch window runs from 3 to 22 May, with the next possible opportunities from 1 to 19 July and 29 August to 14 September.\nMeeting the May window will be extremely difficult. Aside from PAL ramp and fuel filter tests, there is a lot of regular work to be done. This includes mating the various parts of the shuttle system \u2013 such as its external tank, solid rocket boosters and orbiter \u2013 and preparing it for the launch pad.\nHale agrees, saying NASA must work as quickly as possible to fly the shuttle missions needed to complete the International Space Station by 2010. \u201cClearly you can\u2019t have many more big, long stand-downs and still finish the ISS by that date,\u201d Hale says."}
{"idx": "11895", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: With more seniors working already, do we need to raise the retirement age?\nOscar Martinez, 77, greets diners at the Carnation Cafe at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. The chef is the parks longest-tenured employee, beginning as a busboy nearly 57 years ago.\nFor the first time ever, the percentage of Canadian seniors aged 65 to 69 who are still working rose to more than one in four in the autumn of 2013.\nAs shown by Statistics Canada, while the life expectancy of Canadians has been steadily rising, the average number of years spent not working has actually been stable since the mid-1990s \u2013 due to the fact that more and more seniors continue to work past the traditional age of retirement.\nThe employment rate for persons aged 65 to 69 rose from less than one in five (19.6 per cent) in November, 2008, to 23.8 per cent in November, 2012, to 25.4 per cent in November, 2013. (The rate was 30.9 per cent for men and 20.2 per cent for women.) Since some seniors seeking work are unemployed, the labour force participation rate for this age group is even higher than that.\nThere are many reasons for the significant increase in the ranks of working seniors, both positive and negative. Many choose to continue to work even after becoming eligible for public and (for the fortunate) private pension benefits, while others feel that they have to continue to work for financial reasons.\nRegardless, the rapid rise in the proportion of working seniors over age 65 suggests that eligibility for Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) benefits at that age is not a major disincentive to work, as some economists and policy makers have suggested.\nA significant and fast-rising proportion of seniors choose to work and collect OAS benefits at the same time. More than four in 10 (41.1 per cent) of workers age 65 to 69 work on a part-time basis, suggesting that they want to combine income from pensions and income from employment.\nThe Harper Conservatives have, through the 2012 budget implementation bill, increased the age of eligibility for OAS and GIS benefits from age 65 to 67, phased in over six years starting from 2023. By that time, based on the trend since 2008, it seems likely that about one-third of the 65-to-69 age group will still be working.\nMaintaining 65 as the minimum age of eligibility for OAS can be seen as creating a disincentive to work, which will contribute to future labour shortages. From this perspective, one could wield OAS eligibility as a \"stick\" \u2013 postponing benefits so as to force more seniors to work past age 65.\nBut eligibility for OAS does not require a person to withdraw from the labour force; it may act as a \"carrot\" to encourage many to work longer, but in a different job, or on a part-time or part-year basis.\nA key problem with the stick approach is that many older workers are unable to continue working due to poor health. Statistics Canada data for 2009 show that 24 per cent of people who were fully retired did so due to health or disability. And another 7 per cent reported that they had retired to provide care to a partner."}

But as overall system complexity grows, launching the right combination of resources, assigning them to roles and dealing with error conditions become more and more challenging, AWS wrote in a blog post.\nHowever, CloudFormation aims to remove that complexity and in the process allow users to take better advantage of the programmability and scalability of the cloud, AWS said.\nBy creating a template to describe the stack of applications and resources needed, users don't have to do the configuration work manually. CloudFormation takes care of provisioning, while taking into account any dependencies between resources, according to AWS.\nThe stacks of applications and resources that CloudFormation can help provision include server instances, database instances and load balancers. Users can also configure alarms and set triggers that automatically add more capacity.\nAWS has put together a number of sample templates, including ones for content management systems Drupal and Joomla, and the Wordpress blogging platform. Once a template has been created it can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack.\nAWS has also added support for CloudFormation to the AWS Management Console.\nUsing CloudFormation is free of charge. Users pay for the AWS resources needed to run the stack they have put together. Users don't have to sign up for all the resources individually: once they have signed up for CloudFormation, that is handled automatically.\nThe launch of CloudFormation is the second time this year AWS has introduced a product to make its cloud easier to use. In January, the company presented Elastic Beanstalk. Beanstalk provides an environment to develop and run applications in the cloud, while CloudFormation adds a deployment mechanism for multiple resources. The two products can be used together, according to an AWS FAQ."}

The Democratic majority in Congress has refused to approve it out of a legitimate concern over the state of human rights in Colombia and less legitimate desires to pander to organized labor or deny Mr. Bush a foreign policy win.\nWe believe that the trade pact would be good for America\u2019s economy and workers. Rejecting it would send a dismal message to allies the world over that the United States is an unreliable partner and, despite all that it preaches, does not really believe in opening markets to trade. There is no more time to waste. If the lame-duck Congress does not approve the trade pact this year, prospects would dim considerably since it would lose the cover of the rule (formerly known as fast track) that provides for an up-or-down, no-amendment vote.\nBecause of trade preferences granted as part of the war on drugs, most Colombian exports already are exempt from United States tariffs. The new agreement would benefit American companies that now have to pay high tariffs on exports to Colombia.\nIt also would strengthen bonds with an important ally in a volatile corner of South America \u2014 that also is the main source of cocaine shipped into this country and where the United States has very few friends these days.\nIn neighboring Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez spouts fierce anti-American rhetoric to distract attention from his autocratic policies. Last month, Bolivia expelled the United States ambassador and accused Drug Enforcement Administration agents of conspiring against his government. Ecuador has refused to renew a lease on an airbase used by American counternarcotics flights in the coastal city of Manta.\nWe, too, have strong concerns about human-rights violations committed by the government of President \u00c1lvaro Uribe. But Democrats opposing the trade pact on these grounds are ignoring undeniable improvements. Violence has abated considerably during the Uribe administration as it has taken on the left-wing guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and right-wing paramilitaries. The number of trade unionists killed, a major Democratic concern, is still too high but has dropped sharply.\nWashington must keep pressing Bogot\u00e1 to reduce abuses by Colombia\u2019s Army, ensure the prosecution of paramilitary thugs and further rein in violence against union members. It has a powerful tool to do that: $600 million a year in mostly military and anti-narcotics aid.\nFailing to approve this trade agreement would do nothing to improve Colombia\u2019s human-rights record. Walking away from it now would alienate many people in Colombia and undermine Washington\u2019s credibility."}

Mercury, a toxic liquid metal, is used in small-scale gold mines all over the world to separate the gold from the ore, and then released into air and water. Ghana is one of Africa\u2019s top gold producers, and about a million people work in its small gold mines. Workers and nearby communities are directly exposed to mercury.\nThe Minamata Convention was adopted by governments around the world in 2013 to protect the environment and people. Mercury causes brain damage and other severe health conditions, and it can kill. The convention obliges governments to reduce mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining, the largest source of mercury pollution in the world. It also requires governments to end particularly harmful practices, such as burning a gold-mercury amalgam in residential areas, and to protect children from exposure.\nWhen I researched mercury use in Ghana, I watched miners mix liquid mercury in pans filled with ore in order to attract the gold particles. They then held this gold-mercury amalgam over an open fire to burn off the mercury and retrieve the raw gold. Even children were working with mercury. One of them, 12-year-old \u201cKwame,\u201d told me: \u201cI burn it on my own, where I get fire, at my mother\u2019s house or any place.\u201d Kwame carried a small bottle of mercury with him at all times. He and his fellow miners had never been told about its dangers.\nUp till now, Ghana\u2019s government had a lax attitude toward mercury, allowing its sale and use. I visited a store where mercury was sold in small wrapped plastic balls, in plastic bottles, and in large containers too heavy to lift. Ghana was also notably absent when the convention was negotiated. But this has started to change. With donor support, Ghana has begun training health workers on mercury\u2019s harmful effects and taken some steps to address child labor in its mines.\nGhana\u2019s ratification of the Minamata Convention is good news for ordinary Ghanaians, especially its children.

Fifty years since an ordinary Dublin couple, John and Kay O\u2019Loughlin Kennedy, started \u201cAfrica Concern\u201d in their living room and, in doing so, defied the odds to make a difference.\n1968 was a very different time in Ireland, when only the church or State managed anything of scale and yet, despite having no experience, John and Kay mounted a fundraising campaign that went on to raise the equivalent of \u20ac60 million.\nThat money channelled desperately needed relief supplies into the experienced and strong hands of those on the ground, people like Aengus and Jack Finucane whose courage and leadership went on to shape and build the organisation.\nWhat John and Kay managed to do, and what the Finucane brothers continued to do, was to tap into the conscience and generosity of a nation that itself had experienced the brutality of starvation and conflict. Their approach marked a move towards a modern Irish humanitarian response, bringing together public support and on-the-ground response and recovery, paired with a relentless focus on the poorest and hardest to reach.\nTo this day, it is the cornerstone of Concern\u2019s work and it is what I learned when I joined back in 1982.\nIt is why I ended up in some of the toughest, most challenging contexts in the world, including Kosovo, Darfur, Rwanda and many more. In every one of these places, I have snapshots of people, faces and moments of time that sum up both the horror and humanity of war.\nPeople like the incredible Martha, who I met in South Sudan. One of two million people driven from her home by the brutal conflict, Martha arrived at the Concern centre with her severely malnourished child. With the help of our local staff, her youngest was healthy within weeks. Martha went on to study at night, taking all the training available, and is now helping to run the centre.\nI was there at a great time. A peace agreement was in place and Martha and the team were able to leave the camp and join Concern\u2019s 50th party. Looking radiant in a long red sparkling dress, that evening she danced for the first time in years.\nThese are the people you take with you, that inspire you. And today we need that inspiration. In this, our 50th year, we are calling for a resurgence of humanity \u2013 one that challenges the politics of isolationism, of indifference and intolerance.\nHumanitarian aid at its best embodies a very human response of love and care, a force for good against the cruelty and devastation of war and disasters. The most powerful reminder of this force is the testimony of those who have received aid, recovered and rebuilt their lives, and also the people who have contributed to making that possible.\nThese include the thousands across every community in Ireland who support our work and people like Uzo, a keen runner, who ran the Dublin Marathon for Concern in 2018. Uzo\u2019s family originally came from Biafra and it struck me as a great example of the generational journey that Concern and Ireland have gone through.\nLike John and Kay in 1968, and every person who has supported us this year and throughout the last half century, Uzo was taking a stand against indifference.\nThis year has brought home to me just how important our values are, values which are rooted in the Irish experience.

It combined elements of hits \u201cTeam Fortress 2\u201d and \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d to create something completely new.\nBut for a multiplayer game to have any longevity, it needs to consistently improve and add new content.\n20 millionBlizzard announced in October that \u201cOverwatch\u201d had hit 20 million players in its first five months.\n\u201cOverwatch\u201d took a step back in late June when it unveiled a deeply flawed competitive mode, but it rallied the following month. This ranked mode is quite serviceable now, though Blizzard still hasn\u2019t figured out how to group players during their 10 placement matches (those that determine where your starting rank will be). Myself, everyone I know and a few thousand other vocal online complainers were grouped with players far below their skill levels. But I was able to climb back to respectability in a few days.\nWe, the faithful, were also rewarded with some pretty solid free content in the game\u2019s first six months. Ana is a fun, interesting new character. Sombra is neat in theory, but she\u2019s pretty useless in practice. The Eichenwalde map is amazing. The Halloween event was fantastic from top to bottom, with great new character skins and a decent temporary game mode. The holiday event has not been as strong, but it game me that amazing Nutcracker skin for Zenyatta.\nMultiplayer games also require frequent balance changes. After millions of games, some characters emerge globally as being stronger or weaker than others. It\u2019s important to constantly tweak their abilities to keep things fair. If you don\u2019t, every game will just be the same six heroes battling against each other over and over. I can think of a few such adjustments in \u201cOverwatch\u201d that kept matches fresh, such as the changes to Mercy and Symettra\u2019s abilities.\nAnother hurdle for modern multiplayer games is finding a way to create a professional gaming scene that can compete against giants like \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d and \u201cCounter-Strike.\u201d Blizzard did an admirable job in its first year by creating the Overwatch World Cup, a tournament that pitted the best players from 16 countries against each other. It added a sense of regional pride that is absent during most professional tournaments, as teams participating in those are often made up of good players from all over the world.\n3.1 millionMore than 3.1 million fans voted on which players would be selected for the regional teams in the Overwatch World Cup.\nMy \u201cOverwatch\u201d addiction is not what it was in the spring and summer.

But I can\u2019t quit her.\nStill, I play \u201cOverwatch\u201d at least once a week. It\u2019s a great game to unwind to. You lie your baggage at its feet, and you\u2019re rewarded with the anguish of others.\n\u201cOverwatch\u201d didn\u2019t move any mountains, but it was a great game out of the box that has been incrementally improved over time.

{"idx": "11908", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The slow growth of the nation\u2019s economy over the past decade has posed challenges for police agencies in maintaining their operational effectiveness. City leaders were obligated in 2008 to make cuts in areas of their police agencies that they felt would make the least impact on those agencies\u2019 ability to respond to calls for service. Agencies started cutting salaries, staffing and budgets to meet the significant losses in tax revenues and the reduction of federal grants.\nVarious types of programs were eliminated from police agencies across the country. Programs such as DARE, bike patrol, motor units, aviation units and others sustained significant cuts or even elimination. SWAT teams were not immune to this phenomenon, and some police agencies downsized or even eliminated their tactical units. That sent tactical commanders searching for viable options to present to their chiefs and city leaders so that they could maintain their current readiness.\nDuring my career on SWAT I served on regional swat teams, a city SWAT team and even a hybrid metro team comprising several large tactical SWAT teams. Each of these teams had its unique advantages and disadvantages. However, for the smaller agency struggling to meet its payroll, a regional SWAT team may be your answer in this economy of little growth and minimal federal funding.\nA regional SWAT team often includes several police agencies within its organization. These departments will donate officers and equipment to the regional team, providing a large pool of people and resources that the smaller agency would not have available.\nThe biggest advantage from a team commander\u2019s perspective is that the talent on a regional team in many cases can be significantly greater than a team from a smaller agency. More than half of the police agencies in this country have fewer than 50 full-time sworn officers in their ranks, and a police agency with 50 full-time cops would find it very difficult to field a properly outfitted SWAT team with the appropriate number of team members.\nIf seven police agencies have around 30-50 total cops in their departments and each selects three of its best officers to lend to a regional team, then the regional team now has 21 tactical operators. Conversely, if those same agencies had their own 21-man SWAT teams, they would likely struggle to find 21 capable and willing cops among their relatively small pools of officers who can operate at the high standards that every tactical team should be held to.\nThat\u2019s not to say that small agencies don\u2019t have great SWAT teams. I have worked with and trained some very high-speed tactical teams that come from small agencies. My experience has been that these teams don\u2019t lower their standards to allow for the chief\u2019s cousin to play SWAT. The team commanders will train and outfit their small teams with the same high standards that every team is expected to meet.\nDeveloping a regional SWAT team starts with a host agency that can house and be the primary lead for the development and ongoing maintenance of the regional team. Then all of the participating agencies are identified and the command structure is selected and put in place. The command structure doesn\u2019t necessarily come from the host agency. The team commander and the team leaders should be selected for their qualifications, experience and their ability to lead. These leaders will now have the painful task of developing the regional SWAT team\u2019s policy and procedures.\nThe most important components of developing a regional SWAT team are its policy and procedures, along with its operating standards. I speak from experience, as I was tasked to develop my agency\u2019s policy and procedures when we left a regional team to start our city team.\nLater in life I was also a part of developing the metro SWAT team\u2019s policy and procedures.

Companies that get too comfortable with their market dominance often grow too large and complacent, allowing younger and hungrier competitors to introduce innovative new products that render their business models obsolete.\nIn recent years, Apple disrupted the entire PC and cell phone markets with its iOS devices. In the health-care industry, that same disruptive effect can be spotted in three companies that possess potentially game-changing technologies -- Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), Antares Pharma (NASDAQ:ATRS), and MannKind (NASDAQ:56400P706).\nLet's take a closer look at these three companies, and the companies that could be affected by their medical innovations.\nWill 3-D-printed organs render waiting lists obsolete?\nOrganovo uses 3-D printers to print human tissues. Although the idea of using its 3-D printers to eventually print out human organs has captured the media's attention, let's not get ahead of ourselves yet.\nOrganovo's 3D printer. Source: 3dprinter.net.\nOrganovo's first marketed product will be a 3-D-printed liver assay for toxicology, which is superior to the traditional 2-D cell cultures used by the pharmaceutical industry during clinical studies. Organovo claims that its 3-D-printed liver assays can retain key liver functions for up to 40 days and can be tested on with multiple doses of the same drug -- two key advantages that 2-D cell cultures lack.\nBy testing drugs more thoroughly on 3-D liver assays during preclinical trials, pharmaceutical companies are less likely to fail during phase 3 trials because of unforeseen liver toxicity in test patients. According to CEO Keith Murphy, 25% of the failed or withdrawn drugs between 1990 and 2010 were due to liver toxicity that wasn't initially predicted during earlier clinical studies.\nOrganovo expects to launch its 3-D-printed liver assays by late 2014. However, it hasn't provided a long-term timetable for actual 3-D organ printing, although a full-sized printed liver would be the next obvious step.\nAt this point, Organovo is still a very speculative bet on a technology that could eventually render organ transplants obsolete. Last quarter, the company generated less than $0.1 million in revenue -- a 95% plunge from the $0.5 million it reported a year earlier. Its revenue consists entirely of collaboration revenues.\nNevertheless, investors are still giving Organovo the benefit of the doubt, and shares have rallied more than 300% over the past 12 months.\nFor patients who hate needles, Antares' reusable needle-free injectors could be worth a look.

{"idx": "11912", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A few years ago, Kenyan commercial banks were fighting hard to prevent mobile phone companies from engaging in the business of money transfer. They argued that money transfers were a preserve of banks\u2014thus allowing mobile phone providers to engage in them was in violation of the Banking Act. The banks lost this fight. However, as banks have recently begun to tap into the mobile banking industry themselves, the mobile phone providers are now pressuring politicians to stop the banks from entering the mobile banking systems purely on their own.\nHad the technocrats (the non-political experts in government) sided with the commercial banks and political elements, this intense lobbying would have cost the country a great opportunity\u2014one that has turned Kenya into a leading example of an innovative approach to increasing financial inclusion in the world. To be sure, the credit for effectively opposing the lobbying efforts by commercial banks is shared\u2014the Central Bank of Kenya (especially its regulatory and payments systems departments), the Communications Commission of Kenya, and notably also the then-permanent secretary of the Ministry of Information and Communications, Bitange Demo, who made a strong case for licensing mobile banking. These officials clearly understood the political economy of private interests seeking to erect political barriers to entry, the consequences of which would have been large welfare losses to society at large while concentrating benefits among the few.\nNow the tables have turned. After the phenomenal success of mobile banking, which clearly threatened the profitability of traditional banking models, commercial banks changed their operations and began to invest in mobile phone-based banking. They started by introducing products that linked to the services offered by the mobile phone companies. Today, commercial banks have ratcheted up their operations to full mobile banking including introducing their own SIM cards instead of relying on those issued by the mobile phone providers. Now, mobile phone operators are crying foul and seeking political cover with the intention of barring such operations. They claim that this is an issue of security: Equity\u2019s thin SIM technology could expose its users to financial fraud. These complaints are just another attempt to create barriers to entry in order to reduce competition, just from the other side.\nEquity Bank and Safaricom are some of the best managed, innovative and successful companies in Africa. Both headquartered in Kenya, they are leaders in their core businesses\u2014Equity in banking and Safaricom in mobile telephony and mobile banking. They have coexisted in harmony and, in the past, Equity has even sought to backpack on Safaricom\u2019s success by introducing products that tap on M-Pesa, thus benefiting both the mobile phone company (in expanding its business) and also increasing Equity\u2019s profitability and customer base. Thus, by and large, they have coexisted harmoniously. Until now.\nRecently, Equity Bank has introduced new technology that uses an independent SIM card (one not issued by a mobile phone company). This paper-thin SIM card is layered on top of a customer\u2019s existing card without affecting the customer\u2019s original service provider\u2019s network reception. With this SIM card, customers need not change to dual SIM card handsets, and they can make calls, send messages and transfer funds from the same phone. In September 2014, the Communications Authority of Kenya gave Equity Bank a license to use the technology. Safaricom has come out strongly in opposition to the introduction of the new technology, arguing that it puts users at risk of fraud and that the approval was granted before full legislation was enacted. Just as commercial banks had done when their core business was threatened by mobile phone service providers, Safaricom has sought protection from politicians\u2014who have now recommended that Equity\u2019s approval be suspended until they are satisfied with the security of the technology.\n"}

For decades, the magazine has frightened its conservative readers with Malthusian horrors: \u201cyoung, often teenaged, unmarried mothers\u201d incentivized by welfare to breed a \u201cpermanent underclass.\u201d Welfare, Commentary consistently argues, creates a parallel society, with values so different that \u201cin many welfare families, no one has ever held a regular job,\u201d and children are not \u201csocialized to the world of work.\u201d Hordes of the just-hatched bastards (in the technical sense) rove the streets, preying on vulnerable young Hudson Institute staffers. Not exactly compassionate conservatism.\nSo what explains the magazine\u2019s Scrooge-like conversion? Well, I left out a word. Actually, Commentary loves poor Orthodox people\u2019s babies.\nYou know what else they possess? Staggering quantities of public assistance. Take the overwhelmingly Hasidic Kiryas Joel, the poorest place in America. As the Times reported last year, \u201chalf of [its] residents receive food stamps, and one third receive Medicaid benefits and rely on federal vouchers to help pay their housing costs.\u201d And boy, do they have children: The median household in Kiryas Joel has six people, and the median age is twelve. Many of its men learn Torah full-time instead of working, and the community\u2019s low high-school graduation rate would be even lower if its religious schools had real academic standards. These kids are hardly being \u201csocialized to the world of work.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Kiryas Joel: back in 1996, at the heart of \u201cwelfare reform,\u201d a full third of Williamsburg\u2019s Hasidim received public assistance.\nWelfare is, and has been for some time, a crucial ingredient in these communities. While Hasidim take care of their own, they also get taxpayers to take care of them. Like Israeli Haredim, Kiryas Joel\u2019s Hasidim vote together to secure, for instance, a \u201cluxurious 60-bed postnatal maternal care center\u2026 built with $10 million in state and federal grants.\u201d Off the record, New York City officials admit that Williamsburg\u2019s Hasidim \u201cwork the system,\u201d and experts who don\u2019t have to be reelected come out and just admit there\u2019s widespread fraud. As Shmarya Rosenberg has argued, the Haredi birthrate, to be sustainable, requires large and consistent infusions of cash from outside. In Williamsburg, welfare really is a lifestyle.\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that these are, detail for detail, the exact welfare ghosts of Commentary\u2019s past. Public subsidies incentivize industrial birthing. Welfare discourages remunerative work. A parallel, insular society evolves, dependent on the outside world and contemptuous of its values. It\u2019s wrong for Commentary to valorize an Orthodox demographic boom that depends heavily on the welfare state, given that for decades they have attacked those very institutions for promoting those very trends among the poor. But then again, Haredi children are the key to \u201cJewish continuity\u201d\u2026 so yea, Commentary will be coming to the bris."}

The concept of cryptocurrency has been around for years already, but it looks like Hollywood is starting to take notice.\nThe producers of a planned Atari movie about the founding of the influential video game company are looking to raise as much as $40 million through a new cryptocurrency to secure enough funds to complete the film. Could this be a viable way for companies to make movies?\nVariety (via The Verge) reports that a production and financing company called Vision Tree is looking to raise $40 million through the private sale of \u201cBushnell tokens,\u201d new digital coins named after Nolan Bushnell*, the founder of Atari. Companies you\u2019ve never heard of attempt to capitalize on big trends all the time, but what drew my attention here was that Leonardo DiCaprio\u2018s Appian Way production company is co-producing this movie. They\u2019ve produced some major films over the past few years (The Wolf of Wall Street, The Revenant, Shutter Island, etc.), so if they think there\u2019s something to this, maybe there is?\nSo is cryptocurrency a viable option for Hollywood financiers? It\u2019s still too early to say for sure, but I\u2019m not fully convinced this is going to be the way of the future for this industry. Hollywood is notoriously risk-averse, and the very nature of cryptocurrencies involves paying traditional money for a portion of currency with no physical form or intrinsic value. It\u2019s an inherently risky proposition, and it doesn\u2019t help that Bitcoin \u2013 the most recognizable cryptocurrency \u2013 lost a third of its value by the end of January earlier this year because the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is paying increasingly more attention to these deregulated markets.\nThe notion of a major studio relying on cryptocurrencies to fund a huge blockbuster seems unlikely to me, but as these aforementioned examples are proving, there seems to be room for smaller production companies to experiment with this technology while it\u2019s still considered the Wild West of the tech world. So while Avengers 5 probably won\u2019t be funded using Bitcoin (or \u201cStan Lee tokens,\u201d or whatever the hell), it\u2019s very possible that we\u2019ll see more examples of smaller cryptocurrency-funded projects popping up in the future. Until the bubble bursts, that is.\n*Bushnell is currently under fire for inappropriate behavior in the workplace during the early days of the company, and in the wake of those allegations, a prominent gaming conference recently rescinded their decision to honor him with an award.

But the Republican was less ready to answer whether such outside spending should be allowed in other states.\nAsked by National Journal whether Sullivan supported the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which contributed to the rise of powerful outside groups such as American Crossroads and Senate Majority PAC, Sullivan demurred, saying he very much supports \"strong free speech.\" The pledge, he said, was not a reference to Citizens United.\nSullivan failed to directly answer two follow-up questions about Citizens United from local media in Alaska, one of which asked whether all states shouldn't have the privilege of elections free from outside influence.\n\"This is not about Citizen United, this is not about legislation pending or looking to be introduced in Congress,\" Sullivan said. \"This is about the way we think this race should be conducted in Alaska to give our citizens voice.\"\u00a6This is an unprecedented sum of third-party special-interest money.\"\nIn a follow-up call after the conversation, campaign spokesman Mike Anderson gave the first affirmative support for the decision. \"At the end of the day, Dan does support Citizens United,\" Anderson said.\nThis is the first time Sullivan has voiced his opinion on the decision, but he wrote in a response to the Associated Press in June that \"Sen. Begich has had more than five years to address the influence of outside groups in elections\" and still hadn't accomplished anything.\nSullivan is still in the midst of a three-way race for the Republican nomination. He will take on Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and 2010 Senate candidate Joe Miller on Aug. 14.\nSullivan said Treadwell and Miller had not been asked to sign the pledge because they hadn't yet been hit by outside ads.\nBegich's campaign fired back with a response that afternoon criticizing Sullivan's hesitation on the question.\n\"Sullivan again tried to tell Alaskans one thing, but then quickly revealed the truth today \u2014 he supports allowing corporations to engage in unlimited spending in our elections,\" said Susanne Fleek-Green, campaign manager for Alaskans for Begich. \"If Dan Sullivan makes it out of his competitive primary, it will be a stark contrast between his put-corporations-first position and Senator Begich's support for real campaign finance reform, including support of a constitutional amendment throwing out Citizens United.\""}

He can either accept the extradition to the United States or fight it before the court, explained the official, who wasn't authorized to be identified by name in media reports.\nCarvajal, who climbed the ranks in Venezuela since he befriended Ch\u00e1vez in the early 1980's, is no stranger to U.S. law enforcement agencies.\nThe group became to be known in Venezuela as the \"Cartel of the Suns\" because top officers in the country wear sun insignias on their uniforms.\nCarvajal also allegedly provided weapons to armed FARC guerrillas in Colombia, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, and helped fund the group's activities by facilitating shipments of large amounts of U.S.-bound cocaine through Venezuela.\nIn 2014, he became the highest-ranking Venezuelan official ever arrested on a U.S. drug warrant.

They had developed these tics\u2014motor and vocal tics\u2014and they were completely mystified by what was happening, and they looked so frightened and upset, as did their parents who were with them. It was really unsettling. And then I immediately started writing. The case was in the background as I started.\nThis is not the first time you\u2019ve drawn from true events to craft a novel. An earlier novel of yours, The Song Is You was inspired by a true crime, as was Bury Me Deep. What sorts of stories tend to catch your attention and stick with you?\nIn some ways I guess they all are based on real life events; it is only the degree to which they change when I start writing. Sometimes they diverge wildly. For some reason I seem to need the real-life hook. I grew up reading true crime and that is probably the biggest reason, but there are lots of stories that I know won\u2019t be a book. They might be too upsetting or dark to spend a whole year or two working on, and I don\u2019t want to be there for that long. So those end up talking to me but don\u2019t catch fire.

He says the Liberal government prefers to concentrate on diplomacy and would not discuss the country's obligations under the armistice that ended the first Korean War in 1953.\nShould the tense standoff on the Korean Peninsula escalate into war, the United Nations could come calling on Canada for a military commitment.\nThere are reports that China has put its air force units along the North Korean border on heightened alert, and South Korea has moved its military to a heightened state of readiness over the possibility that the regime in Pyongyang will conduct another missile test, following a failed attempt last week.\nChina quickly denied the reports on Friday, but the buildup, which multiple media reports say could also include Russian forces, comes as a U.S. aircraft carrier strike force now moves towards Korean waters.\nRear Admiral Jim Kilby, commander of Carrier Strike Group One posted the news on social media. Last week, the White House said the task force was on its way to Korean waters when it, in fact, was not.\nCanada fought under the UN in the Korean War and is part of an organization known as the United Nations Command, or UNC, which came out of the 1953 armistice that ended three years of brutal fighting between North and South Korea.\nThere was never a formal peace treaty and the two nations have remained technically at war for over six decades.\nNorth Korea warns of nuclear attack on U.S.\n\"Diplomacy is the one thing we need to focus on first, because at the end of the day you could be putting soldiers' lives at risk,\" Sajjan said from Mumbai, India, in a conference call with reporters in Ottawa.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau recently expressed concern about what North Korean leader Kim Jong-un might do next.\n\"We are worried about the dangerous and unstable North Korean regime \u2014 period,\" Trudeau said on April 10 while in Normandy, concluding visits to Canadian First and Second World War battlefields.\n\"This rogue regime in North Korea is a danger not only to the immediate region but the entire world,\" Trudeau said.\nSajjan said he has been in close touch with U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis and they spoke specifically about the escalating tensions in Korea.\nIf the shooting starts, the United States-South Korea Combined Forces Command would take the lead in the initial stage of fighting, but policy documents prepared for former defence minister Peter MacKay in 2010 say reinforcements could be assembled using the existing, decades-old UN framework.\n\"The UNC structure would be used as a means of force-generating, and receiving and tasking any contributions that UNC sending states may choose to contribute in the event of a crisis,\" said the document, originally obtained and published by The Canadian Press.\nThe Department of National Defence confirmed on Friday that Canada remains part of the organization because it was one of the original 17 countries that took part in the fighting.\nSix members of the Canadian Armed Forces are currently serving with the UNC.\nBut unlike NATO, there is no binding, clear-cut obligation for Canada to join a potential military action in Korea.\nSajjan said National Defence has, regardless of the situation, \"done prudent planning\" for possible crises.\n\"Our military will always play a responsible role, and the responsible role right now is to allow diplomacy to work,\" Sajjan said. \"And, I'm very happy to see China, who has significant influence over North Korea"}
{"idx": "11930", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What enforcement is needed for China to keep to a trade deal with US?\nInterDigital CEO Bill Merritt on the Trump administration's trade negotiations with China.\nPresident Trump is expected to announce plans for an upcoming summit with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on Thursday during his meeting at the White House with the Chinese leader\u2019s special envoy Vice Premier Liu He.\nTrump last month indicated that he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to complete a trade deal with China, insisting that any deal must include protection for intellectual property (IP). Chinese companies talk a good game about respect for IP. However, the challenge is getting the Chinese to move from words to actions and finding an enforcement mechanism that can guarantee that Chinese companies walk the talk.\nMy company is typically listed among the top three or four contributors to wireless standards like 5G, which we\u2019re very proud of. And yet, here\u2019s our tally of getting top global wireless players to sign fair licenses: of the non-Chinese companies that make smartphones, nine out of ten are current licensees, including Apple since before they even made phones and Samsung for more than twenty years. Of the top ten Chinese companies that make smartphones, zero out of 10 are currently licensed. Zero.\nIP has been a centerpiece of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reshape trade with China. And rightly so: manufacturing and supply chains can be drivers of jobs and value, and access to competitive goods can be great for consumers, but intellectual property \u2013 design, innovation, research and development \u2013 is the catalyst that drives all of those.\nIn the wireless industry, the centerpiece for a lot of trade angst these days, this is especially true. Every year, about $20 billion of research worldwide drives standards, like 5G, that underpin $400 billion in smartphone sales, $30 billion in network equipment sales, untold numbers of jobs and dollars in app development, and more than $2 trillion in worldwide operator revenues. And Chinese companies have become significant players in wireless research, especially in the last decade where they\u2019ve joined the ranks of the major standards contributors.\nChina needs to realize and accept that respect for IP goes both ways. You can\u2019t respect and highlight your own IP, and simultaneously disrespect the IP of others. You can\u2019t uphold certain practices with the goal of getting paid royalties, and denigrate those same practices when you\u2019re expected to have to pay.\nFor example, some Chinese companies have demanded in court that companies that owe them a license meet in arbitration, but have resisted arbitration as a form of settling conflicts when they find themselves as the licensee. Chinese companies have argued that European and American courts should only set rates for sales in those countries, but have filed suit in China to have Chinese regional courts set rates for the entire world.\nThe IP issue is not about talk. Xi Jinping signed an accord with the Obama administration to prevent IP theft in 2015, and has talked repeatedly about the importance of protecting intellectual property and punishing infringers. But without fair compensation, unchecked theft of American innovation by bold Chinese manufacturers continues. These companies are unfairly and illegally using patented technology to build smartphones and other gadgets \u2013 without regard for the long-accepted and successful global trade laws that have made those industries successful.\nIt&apos;s clear that Trump is committed to putting the interests of American workers first and ensuring that China respects IP. Trump tweeted recently about the importance of 5G and beyond, and said that he wanted U.S. companies to step up and win through competition \u2026 not exclusion. Very fair, and very true. But the playing field needs to be level"}

When that occurs, we ask the appropriate people to undertake an investigation and to look into the charges or the allegations that have been made. We do that because we care that things be done as well as it's humanly possible to do them.\nYou say that everything we do is being called a mistake"}

The verdict from the court, authorized by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), renewed the controversial data-collection campaign that has posed serious threats to Americans\u2019 right to privacy and, in turn, the U.S. Constitution.\nOn June 6, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence declassified certain information about this telephony metadata collection program in order to provide the public with a more thorough and balanced understanding of the program. Consistent with his prior declassification decision and in light of the significant and continuing public interest in the telephony metadata collection program, the DNI has decided to declassify and disclose publicly that the Government filed an application with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking renewal of the authority to collect telephony metadata in bulk, and that the Court renewed that authority.\nWhile the ODNI statement does not indicate a time period for the extension, nor does it specifically mention Verizon, it will likely renew the program for another three months, considering previous routine orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has publicly defended the NSA spying program, noted that the Verizon phone surveillance has been active \u2014 and renewed every three months \u2014 for at least six years, and it has likely applied to other telecommunication companies as well.\nThe Obama administration has increasingly revealed the extent its secretive mass-communications surveillance since former NSA employee Edward Snowden exposed the scandal earlier this summer. In Snowden\u2019s damning expos\u00e9, he described the NSA\u2019s efforts to extract an array of communications data, including cellphone numbers and information about the length and time of phone calls.\nThe controversy has largely become a bipartisan issue, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have offered both support and scrutiny for the NSA spying program. Some lawmakers have championed the program as an opportunity to contain terrorist threats, while others note that the federal government\u2019s arbitrary collection and stockpiling of Americans\u2019 phone records impede on Americans\u2019 right to privacy while blatantly violating U.S. law.\nOne of the staunchest critics of the program, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has also underscored the agency\u2019s flagrant abuses of the Constitution. Consequently, Paul has introduced legislation to restore the Fourth Amendment\u2019s intention to safeguard Americans\u2019 rights from the tyranny of government.\n\"The revelation that the NSA has secretly seized the call records of millions of Americans, without probable cause, represents an outrageous abuse of power and a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. I have long argued that Congress must do more to restrict the Executive's expansive law enforcement powers to seize private records of law-abiding Americans that are held by a third-party,\" Paul contended when introducing his bill, the Fourth Amendment Restoration Act of 2013.\nThere\u2019s no room for interpretation, liberty-minded Americans assert, and the law\u2019s objective indicates a clear verdict: The Constitution does not permit any agency of the federal government to extract and monitor the phone records of Americans without a warrant based on probable cause."}

Echeverria emphasized that orders are placed in small batches to ensure that the product mix is right -- if something doesn\u2019t hit with shoppers, it\u2019s gone.\nZara also employs over 1,000 designers, and is constantly monitoring global fashion trends. Those being emphasized in this newly-opened flagship include pastels, peplum skirts and minimalist neutrals. For men, there are double-breasted jackets, creeper shoes and blazers with short pants on display.\nZara is just the latest foreign mass retailer to expand its brand on this prime stretch of Fifth Avenue. Japan-based Uniqlo opened up a 89,000 square foot flagship nearby just last fall. For anyone curious what is going to happen to the old Zara store on Fifth (down the block on 54th), it's going to happen to the former Zara store, down the block on 54th Street, it is being converted into a Massimo Dutti shop -- a higher-priced version of Zara also owned by The Inditex Group."}

Prominent among these, are organic farming, nature farming, angara, rishi krishi, panch kavya, biodynamic farming, etc.\nThe most outstanding aspect of biodynamic farming is that none of the inputs are purchased from outside. According to senior scientist, Dr RA Ram, Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), 500 g of compost developed through a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccow pat pit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 obtained at a marginal cost, is sufficient for an acre of farm land.\nFor a similar sized field, comparatively, 4-5 bags of relatively expensive urea will be required. In addition to this, the soil usually absorbs only 46 per cent of the nitrogen released, and the rest is wasted. Leeching causes the formation of nitrous oxide that has been linked with the destruction of the ozone layer, and nitrates are responsible for the pollution of groundwater.\nA national level symposium on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOrganic farming in horticulture for sustainable production\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was organised by CISH on Friday, and was inaugurated by member agriculture, planning commission, Dr Sompal Shastri. In his inaugural address, Dr Shastri said organic farming is not new to India, as it has been practised by farmers in India for over 10,000 years now.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some believe that organic farming causes a reduction in crop yield, but with modern varieties, mechanisation and better irrigation facilities, this factor too has been negated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained.\nDr RK Pathak, director, CISH, said that chemical-based plant protection practices have led to the compaction of soil, low organic matter content in the soil, increase in salinity, sodicity and land submergence, adverse effect on flora and fauna and also a deterioration in the quality of the farm produce.\nIn sharp contrast, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBiodynamic agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking with the energies that create and maintain life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Under this system, the energies from the cosmos, earth, the cow and plants, are systematically and synergistically harnessed for enhancing crop production and to establish, maintain and increase the soil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecosystem.\nExamples of successful farming practices can be seen in mango orchards for the rejuvenation of the trees. A biodynamic tree paste made from mixing cow dung, clay and sand, was used to seal and heal the wounds and for the protection from and control of diseases that are like a plague, wreaking havoc in mango orchards.\nG Kalloo, DDG, ICAR, Delhi, said that there are a number of organic compounds that may be used as parasite predators and used to replace chemical fertilisers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a need to develop technology for the identification and development of bio-agents and also a system for certification, inspection and accreditation of organic crops,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he stressed."}

These were different albums, with different combinations of songs than the Beatles albums released in England. That separate release pattern continued until June 1967 with the release of the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, which was exactly the same record all over the world.\nNow, with the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' first US appearance in full swing, Capitol Records has remastered the entire US catalog and released 12 individual albums and a deluxe box set. I spoke with the project's audio supervisor, Steve Berkowitz, and mastering engineer, Greg Calbi, to learn about how they fine-tuned the sound. The project stretched out for months as they auditioned a vast number of analog and digital masters of the US and British Beatles albums. Berkowitz and Calbi also had access to unplayed original US Beatles LPs, and they used them to get a handle on the sound that Beatles fans heard the first time around.\nWhat's the best archived version of a Beatles song? That gets really complicated, and something Berkowitz and Calbi had to sort out, and did so on a track-by-track basis. Then when those tunes were assembled to make complete albums, it was Calbi's job to make them sound good together. When I did a series of comparisons on my own with LP and CD versions there were clear sonic differences, but I was thrilled with the 2014 US Beatles remasters' sound. Unlike the 2009 stereo-only British CDs, each US album has stereo and mono versions of every tune. That's a pleasant surprise; the 13-disc \"Beatles in Mono\" box that came out in 2009 currently sells for over $170 on Amazon.\nThe two US movie soundtrack albums, \"A Hard Day's Night,\" and \"Help!\" had Beatles tunes and a handful of non-Beatles score tracks, but the British albums had Beatles songs only. The new US remasters have the score tracks, which were mastered from the original analog tapes. I always skipped over the score tunes when I was a kid, but I'm really enjoying them now.\nI bought the US Beatles Capitol Albums sets when they were remastered in 2004, and compared those discs with the 2014 remasters. Frankly, there's no comparison; the new ones sound better. They're more fleshed out, less compressed, and clearer. So even if you own the 2004 sets I'd recommend buying at least some of the 2014 Beatles albums.\nI was hoping Capitol would have remastered the only official Beatles concert album, \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl,\" which debuted in 1977 on LP, and never appeared on CD.

{"idx": "11967", "prompt": "Continue the following text: What\u2019s behind the decline in blood transfusions?\nOne day in 2011, an ambulance pulled up to the Stanford emergency room and paramedics unloaded a man in his 30s who had crashed his motorcycle. He was in critical condition: Tests showed dangerously low blood pressure, indicating that around 40 percent of his blood was lost. And an ultrasound revealed that the blood was collecting in his belly, suggesting that one or more of his abdominal organs was the source of the blood loss.\nPaul Maggio, MD, a trauma surgeon and co-director of critical care medicine at Stanford Hospital & Clinics, sped the patient into the operating room. But he made sure that the technicians prepping his operating room took the time to set up one key piece of equipment, called an intraoperative cell salvage device, which is now commonly used in trauma cases. As the patient lay on the operating table and Maggio made the first cuts into his abdomen, suction devices slurped up the loose blood, directing it away from the surgery site through tubes. But instead of leading to a container bound for disposal, the tubes led to the salvage device.\nThe ATM-sized machine spun the blood to separate its components, cleaned it of any debris that had been suctioned up from the abdomen and sent it back out into fresh bags. From there, the blood was shunted right back to the patient\u2019s body, through intravenous tubes poking into his veins. The cell salvage device has been around for decades, but only recently has evidence emerged that autotransfusion \u2014 giving patients their own blood instead of blood from donors \u2014 leads to better surgery outcomes. As a result, the use of the machines has gone from extremely rare to commonplace. Today, hospitals that have the machines use them in many scheduled abdominal and heart surgeries and routinely in trauma cases involving massive bleeding.\n\u201cAutotransfusing this patient spared him from getting more banked donor blood and from all the risks associated with it,\u201d says Maggio of the motorcycle crash victim. He turned out to have an injury to his spleen, which Maggio repaired. In all, around 2 liters of blood were collected from the patient\u2019s abdomen, processed through the salvage device, and transfused back into his body.\nBlood transfusions involve routing a needle into one of a patient\u2019s veins \u2014 most often in an arm \u2014 and attaching a thin tube to the needle. Blood flows through the tube directly into the patient\u2019s blood vessels. Ten years ago, a patient like Maggio\u2019s would most likely have had a transfusion of blood donated by volunteers at the Stanford Blood Center. But over the past decade, a growing body of research has revealed that in hospitals around the world, donated blood is used more often, and in larger quantities, than is needed to help patients \u2014 both in operating rooms and hospital wards.\nSome of the research has been conducted by physicians working with patients who refuse donated blood on religious grounds; other findings have come from the front lines of the war in Afghanistan, where blood is hard to transport; and some studies have been inspired simply by the rising cost of blood and a desire to save resources. Some findings are new, and others, like studies by Stanford\u2019s Tim Goodnough, MD, a hematologist and the director of transfusion services, are years old but only recently being noticed. The takeaway message from all is the same: While blood is precious and continues to save lives, its use can be minimized and fine-tuned to optimize patients\u2019"}

By Nina Strochlic.\nWhen a camper\u2019s dad unexpectedly died last month, Andy Braner didn\u2019t send him a condolence email or Facebook message. He got on a plane and flew from Colorado to Texas to be with the grieving teen. For Braner, social media is a means to an end, not a primary tool for building relationships. But it has been misused, and teens are in trouble.\n\u201cIf you ask a teenager who\u2019s really gonna be there with you, they struggle to name people that they call on when life gets really hard,\u201d he says. Braner\u2019s new book, Alone, highlights what he views as the biggest cause of loneliness: Facebook, Twitter, and sites that that aim to bring us together. If you ask Braner, social networks are really keep us apart.\nAndy Braner knows teens. He\u2019s seen 20,000, by his estimate, since starting his Colorado adventure sleepaway camp, Kivu, in 2001. And in the past few years, he says he\u2019s seen depression among the kids attending his two-week summer program that aims to disconnect teens from the online world and reconnect them to real life.\nFirst, cellphones get locked in a box. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when their term is over and we give them back the iPhones and iPods, and it\u2019s like crack addicts back on the rocks,\u201d he says with a laugh. Campers spend each session in intense drills that foster bonding, from heart-to-heart conversations inside the cabin to Jet Skiing on the lake. Kivu also organizes gap-year internship programs to help teens decide what career path interests them, along with overseas volunteer trips.\n\u201cIf you look at what Facebook\u2019s done to what I call friendship, we\u2019ve created this illusion of friendship with a click and a \u2018like,\u2019 especially in this young generation of students who don\u2019t know life without social media,\u201d Braner says. For kids entering their teens, social networking is not a new creation, it\u2019s the norm, and that\u2019s the problem, says Braner. This generation doesn\u2019t know friendship without an online component, and many rely on it for needs that are better suited in a human-to-human interaction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to form good friendships out of Facebook, especially in middle school and early high school,\u201d says Phil Gibson, a sophomore at University of San Francisco and longtime KIVU attendee. He calls the camp \u201cone of the most formative pieces of my life.\u201d He was able to connect on a deeper level with other campers than he could with the kids at his high school because there is \u201cno social outlet than the people right in front of you.\u201d Gibson uses the example of asking someone out on a date as how younger generations turn to nonverbal communication to save face. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how to act around people now, because the only thing kids know is how to act on Facebook ... because there\u2019s that easy outlet to avoid the awkwardness early on,\u201d he says.\nAt 35, Braner is far from those angsty teen years, but connects with those wading the rough waters of high school with ease.

{"idx": "11980", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: College basketball is about to get even more complicated.\nThe NCAA announced several major rule changes last week regarding student-athletes pursuing NBA careers. Undrafted players who are invited to the NBA Combine will now be allowed to return to school, \u201celite\u201d high school prospects are allowed to have official relationships with NCAA and USA Basketball-approved agents and the recruiting calendar is changing drastically.\nOn the surface, these seem like positive changes. And some of them are.\nThe idea of letting undrafted players return to school is universally agreed upon. The NCAA never gave a good reason for this restriction in the first place, and this change is good for both schools and athletes. It used to be that players who entered the draft had until the end of May to make their final decision, but this new rule gives them the freedom to take chances with fewer consequences.\nNCAA president Mark Emmert has long pushed the idea that student-athletes are students first \u2013 that they will never get paid by their universities and that the preservation of their amateur status is paramount in sustaining the integrity of college sports.\nA devastating FBI probe shook men\u2019s basketball to its core in February, exposing teams that paid players hundreds of thousands of dollars, directly leading to most of these new rules. One of the other rules the NCAA introduced last week was increasing the accountability of school\u2019s presidents, chancellors and athletic directors when there is indeed a violation.\nThe problem is these rules don\u2019t actually solve the problem of paying high school prospects.\nThese new rules are a middle ground between Emmert\u2019s idea of amateur athletes and others\u2019 desire for salaries for student-athletes. However, this only expands the gray area that is NCAA eligibility.\nAll agents will have to be approved by USA Basketball. Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski and Villanova coach Jay Wright \u2013 among other NCAA D1 coaches \u2013 coach for Team USA, which creates a conflict of interest in their recruiting.\nThe NCAA did not release how \u2013 or if \u2013 they would ramp up policing illegal player payments. Big time \u201celite\u201d prospects like DeAndre Ayton can still get paid $100,000 by Arizona under the table, since giving players access to an agent with 20 other clients in their class is not guaranteed to deter future illegal deals.\nDefining who the \u201celite\u201d prospects are is an unknown process at the moment, and the judgement of these 17- and 18-year-old men could introduce even more corruption and confusion.\nThese young men will still be getting paid in under-the-table deals until punishments and consequences are actually enforced, not just used as threats. Instead of disciplining the three dozen teams that broke their rules, the NCAA is instead appeasing them.\nBig-time programs that were not caught violating NCAA policies earlier this year \u2013 like UCLA \u2013 get the short end of the stick in this deal. Coach Steve Alford has been able to draw countless five-star recruits to Westwood in this one-and-done era while doing it by the books.\nAnd now, the competitors who were seemingly going to fall behind the Bruins after NCAA and FBI sanctions will be brought right back to where they were in the first place. In fact, these rules could make it easier for teams to illegally recruit players.\nNCAA players should not necessarily be paid, nor should they be voiceless \u201camateurs,\u201d but the idea that these changes will get rid of the problems ravaging collegiate men\u2019s basketball is far too optimistic.\nEmmer"}

{"idx": "11985", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Scientists have created a new molecule that shows promise for controlling HIV without daily antiretroviral drugs. The molecule foils a wider range of HIV strains in the laboratory than any known broadly neutralizing HIV antibody and is more powerful than some of the most potent of these antibodies. In addition, the molecule safely protected monkeys from infection with an HIV-like virus during a 40-week study period. Together, the data suggest that the molecule could, with further research, be used to subdue HIV in humans. The authors note that the molecule potentially could be used as both a preventative drug and as a treatment. The new findings appear in the February 18 issue of the journal Nature.\n\u201cThis innovative research holds promise for moving us toward two important goals: achieving long-term protection from HIV infection, and putting HIV into sustained remission in chronically infected people,\u201d said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.\nThe research was led by Michael Farzan, Ph.D., a professor in the department of infectious diseases at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida. The work was funded primarily by NIAID.\nThe new molecule is called eCD4-Ig and works by tightly binding to two unchanging sites on the surface of HIV that the virus uses to attach to receptors on cells called CD4 and CCR5. Typically, when HIV attaches to these receptors, it unlocks a door to the cell and gets inside. However, when eCD4-Ig binds to HIV, it effectively takes away the virus\u2019s key, locking it out of the cell and preventing it from multiplying.\nTo make eCD4-Ig, the scientists took an antibody-like molecule that latches onto the CD4 binding site but does not neutralize HIV on its own, and fused it with a short protein fragment that attaches tightly to the CCR5 binding site. Together, these two arms of the molecule are much more effective at stopping HIV than either one is alone.\nTo test whether eCD4-Ig would protect monkeys from an HIV-like virus (simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV), the scientists synthesized genetic instructions for making the molecule and placed them inside a harmless carrier virus called adeno-associated virus, or AAV. This gene-therapy tool was designed such that once the AAV-modified virus infected a cell, it would cause the cell to make eCD4-Ig indefinitely. The researchers injected the genetically modified AAV into four monkeys. Then they exposed both the treated monkeys and four untreated monkeys to SIV six times at increasingly higher doses over a 34-week period. None of the treated monkeys became infected with SIV, while all of the untreated monkeys did. The eCD4-Ig molecule made in the monkey\u2019s cells persisted in the animals\u2019 blood in a fully functional form and at protective concentrations for the entire 40-week study period.\nIn addition, the scientists found that while monkeys\u2019 immune systems view both eCD4-Ig and broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-like viruses as foreign molecules to some degree, the undesirable immune response generated by eCD4-Ig is milder than that generated by infusions of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. Scientists have been investigating these antibodies as another promising approach to long-acting treatment for HIV.\n"}

Study your passion.\"\nThis was the second year that Edison eighth-graders visited the Notre Dame campus. Last year it was just 30 students. This year it was all of them, split between two days.\nBut this was more than a sightseeing trip. It was more than a \"you-can-be-anything\" pep talk. It was a three-hour immersion into the life of a college student, what equates to a myth for so many. John Reese, the director of student management at Edison, helped organize the visit.\n\"So many of our kids don't really see themselves as college-bound,\" Reese said. \"They simply have not had the exposure to college that others have. We're trying to change that.\"\nAfter meeting with Greene, the students were sent to faculty member Philip Sakimoto in Jordan Hall's Digital Visualization Theater.\n\"I hope that what you see might inspire you today,\" said Sakimoto, who spent 14 years working for NASA. \"I'm going to use this theater to take you places that before you could only visit in your imaginations.\"\nAll Sakimoto did was take them on a 360-degree tour of the universe as they leaned back in the theater-style seats.\n\"This is so cool,\" one student said barely above a whisper to a friend as Sakimoto took the class from the Earth to the moon in a matter of seconds.\n\"Yeah,\" the friend answered. \"This is tight.\"\nBefore they were done, the students had gone on a more than 100,000-light-year journey across the Milky Way. \"You've just been on a trip,\" Sakimoto said, \"through our whole galaxy and beyond.\"\nAs students filed out of the DVT, there was a buzz about what they saw.
