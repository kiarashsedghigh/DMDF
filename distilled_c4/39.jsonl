{"idx": "39007", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In 2011, Utah earned the distinction of becoming the first state to name an official gun. It's the Browning M1911, if you happened to be living under a rock during the recent legislative session. Utah is gun-friendly, and much has been done to ease the process of purchasing a weapon, obtaining a license to carry, and broaden places where gun owners may legally do so.\nAnd yet, despite a clear and consistent lack of support from Utah voters, the Utah Legislature and Rep. Curt Oda continue to fight a one-sided war against fictional gun foes bent on banning guns entirely. It makes for great copy, but \u0097 unfortunately for Utah voters \u0097 bad governance in the real world, as we have seen recently in Oda's comments in response to the Brady Campaign.\nThe mission of the Brady Campaign is to free America from gun violence through the promotion of sensible gun laws. It is named after Jim Brady, press secretary for Ronald Reagan, who was shot in the head with a .22 R\u00f6hm RG-14 revolver during a 1981 assassination attempt. John Hinckley, Jr. would not have been able to purchase the weapon had background checks been mandatory at the time.\nThe Brady Campaign gave Utah, Arizona and Alaska gun laws their lowest possible score \u0097 a zero. In response, Oda, a concealed weapons permit instructor, said, \"I'm glad we got a zero from that group. I actually wish we would get a negative score from them \u0097 like an F-minus-minus.\" Oda continued, \"These anti-gun people are really anti-self defense ... . We continually push for safety and education. But the 'antis' don't want education. They just want an all-out ban. Their mission is to get rid of guns all together.\"\nThis is incorrect. The Brady Campaign and Alliance for a Better Utah simply advocate for common sense gun laws that keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally unstable, and away from schools and churches \u0097 places where our children play and our families come together in worship.\nIn fact, we wonder who these \"antis\" are. It's not us, and it's not the Brady Campaign either. Oda seems to be the only one discussing such measures.\nThis is not the first time Oda has manufactured problems to further his cause. He ran a bill last session removing the 1,000-foot open-carry buffer zone around public schools, a move which 60 percent of Utahns oppose and just 36 percent support. And he has been the loudest voice in the Legislature for ensuring guns can be carried on public university campuses, despite the fact that only 29 percent of Utahns support such a measure.\nThe obvious question is why? These bills clearly do not have popular support, and yet they appear on the legislative agenda every year in response to imagined challenges to legal gun ownership that never materialize.\nThe Brady Campaign is not telling Oda, or any Utahn with a legally purchased firearm, to put them away. They are simply pointing out that 60 percent of the Utah voters favor a compromise between gun rights and gun safety.\nThey recognize that there are certain places where guns simply do not belong, and there is work still to be done to ensure that guns remain out of the hands of those who would use them for harm.\nThere is a common ground here. It's unfortunate that Oda does not seem to be interested in finding it, and even more unfortunate that the Legislature is following his lead.\nDiane P. Stewart is a member of the board of directors of Alliance for a Better Utah"}

Dino Rossi (R) are launching two new TV spots ahead of the Aug. 17 primary.\nMurray's latest ad, her third, marks her first negative spot in the race. It hammers Rossi for his opposition to financial regulatory reform.\n\"Dino Rossi first refused to take a position on Wall Street reform. Then he had a fundraiser on Wall Street, and another in Washington with corporate lobbyists,\" the narrator of the ad says. \"Next thing you know, Dino sides with his big money friends and calls for the repeal of financial reforms. Dino Rossi: the best friend Wall Street and big banks can buy.\" Murray's camp did not provide a figure for how much it is spending on the ad, which will run statewide.\nThe ad references a late July interview on ABC/Washington Post's \"Top Line\" program in which Rossi said that he would back repealing the financial regulatory reform law.\nBut perhaps most interesting about the ad is that it seeks to tie Rossi not only to Wall Street, but also to George W. Bush. The 30-second spot opens with an image of Bush while the narrator intones: \"Bailouts. Bonuses. Lost savings. Foreclosed homes.\" The ad is evidence that Democratic candidates continue to link their Republican rivals to the unpopular president even as national Democrats are rolling out a strategy of tying Republican candidates to the \"tea party.\"\nNational Republicans responded by charging that Murray has also taken money from Wall Street donors and that the ad is an attempt to change the topic away from her record of \"spending, taxing, and growing the size of government.\"\n\"Patty Murray has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wall Street banks and special interest lobbyists, yet her attack ad conveniently fails to mention that this 'reform' bill was supported by the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and that it was opposed by small business owners and job creators,\" said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Brian Walsh.\nRossi's ad, his first of the race, is a positive spot that highlights his modest upbringing; he grew up one of seven in a family that struggled to make ends meet.\n\"Growing up, I was the youngest of seven raised on a schoolteacher's salary, and I worked my way through college waxing floors at the Space Needle,\" Rossi says in the straight-to-camera spot. \"That's why I can't stand what's going on in the U.S. Senate. They're wasting money on programs that aren't creating jobs or helping the economy, and running up debt that's threatening our future.\"\nThe ad, like the Web video that Rossi used to officially kick off his bid in June, makes no mention of Murray - or of Rossi's two previous statewide runs (he made unsuccessful bids against Gov.

She's Maria Altmann, 80-something and living quietly in Los Angeles, an immigrant since escaping Vienna at the brink of World War II. Her wealthy family was dismantled, robbed and killed; the Nazis looted musical instruments, the silver and several now-priceless artworks by Gustav Klimt. One in particular, a gold-shellacked portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Maria's aunt, looks like a fever dream inspired by episodes of \"Pimp My Ride\" \u2014 but has become, in one character's words, \"the Mona Lisa of Austria\" since the war. Reynolds is her lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, the guy who really did help Maria get her paintings back in 2006 after years of fighting against the Austrian government.\nThe ingredients, then, are all here for a safe and ennobling courtroom drama, which in essence \"Woman in Gold\" is, with a parallel line of flashbacks to prewar Austria to round out the tale. For a Holocaust movie, it must get some credit for focusing on the lesser yet still monumental crimes against Europe's Jews. Austria as a state comes off looking quite the worse for it. So determined Austria was to cling to the big gold Klimt that it overlooked the glaring inconvenience that the painting was plucked off the walls of Maria's family home in a flurry of glorified looting; Hitler ended up with one of her family's paintings in his Swiss compound, and Goering got some of the jewels. Maria and Randy offer every opportunity for them to say \"our bad.\" Instead, they cling to their spoils. And so the phrase \"art restitution\" gets a real workout in Alexi Kaye Campbell's script, based on the two protagonists' life stories.\nThere's not an overabundance of subtlety in \"Woman in Gold,\" if only because there's only so much room for nuance when you're arguing against the criminal legacy of Nazism. Austria's argument for keeping the portrait comes down, in a nutshell, to \"yes, but we really want it and we've now had it for so long.\" It's up to Reynolds and Mirren to pull something fun or unexpected out of the rhetoric. Turns out there's not much, in the abundant speeches they deliver, but the case is made quite clear, that stealing things and then keeping them while also killing people's families is not the right side of history, for the record.\nDirector Simon Curtis (\"My Week with Marilyn\") manages to wring most of the movie's pathos out of the flight story of the younger Maria (played by Tatiana Maslany) and her family's sudden dissolution. Rich though they were, something about being a refugee, fleeing without so much as a suitcase, has a way of laying a person low.

It said that there were some $27 billion in insured losses, while overall costs \u2014 including losses not covered by insurance \u2014 totaled $90 billion. Those figures were down from $31 billion and $110 billion respectively in 2014.\nThe costliest single event for the insurance industry was a series of winter storms that hit the northeastern U.S. and Canada in February. They generated insured losses of $2.1 billion and total losses of $2.8 billion.\nIn contrast, the earthquake in Nepal caused total damage valued at $4.8 billion, but only $210 million of that was insured. That underlined the fact that, in developing countries, the level of insurance coverage remains very low.\nIn several other years, hurricanes hitting North America in particular have caused significant costs to the insurance industry.\nHowever, \"in terms of financial losses, we were somewhat fortunate in 2015: strong tropical cyclones frequently only hit sparsely populated areas or did not make landfall at all,\" said Peter Hoeppe, the head of Munich Re's risk research unit. \"In the North Atlantic, El Nino helped to curtail the development of heavy storms.\"\nEl Nino is caused by the warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that causes changes in rainfall patterns. Hoeppe cautioned that scientists believe the phenomenon may be followed by its twin sister, La Nina, which would encourage the formation of North Atlantic hurricanes."}

Lawyers for Wal-Mart had argued that workers did not demand their penalty wages on a timely basis.\nBut jurors in Alameda County Superior Court decided otherwise, handing a big win to the group of employees who had worked in Wal-Mart's California stores from Jan. 1, 2001, through May 6 this year.\nA jubilant Michael Christian, one of the San Francisco lawyers who represented the plaintiffs, said the verdict made for \"a good day.\"\n\"There was an abundance of evidence that Wal-Mart knew that workers did not get meal periods for many years and they did nothing,\" he said. \"The jury concluded that conduct was unacceptable\" and that Wal-Mart \"deserved to be punished for its willful indifference to its workers.\"\nWal-Mart said it disagreed with the verdict and would appeal. The company also said that because the case involved a meal-period statute that was unique to California, the verdict had no bearing in any other state.\nBut many legal experts said that with similar litigation pending in about 40 other states, the verdict was certain to have a ripple effect far beyond California.\nToby Marshall, a Seattle lawyer who represents workers in a similar class-action against Wal-Mart in Washington, said Thursday's verdict would strengthen other claims.\n\"This is a very clear public statement that its policies are against the law,\" Marshall said of Wal-Mart. \"While each state's law is different, the fact that one jury found that Wal-Mart's corporate policies are resulting in wage and hour violations means that it's more likely that a jury here in Washington or elsewhere is going to find violations.\"\nWal-Mart has acknowledged that it had \"compliance issues\" when the statute took effect in 2001, spokeswoman Mona Williams said in a statement.\n\"Wal-Mart has since taken steps to ensure all associates receive their meal periods, including adopting new technology that sends alerts to cashiers when it is time for their meal breaks,\" she said. \"The system will automatically shut down registers if the cashier does not respond.\"\nWilliams added that based on a ruling in another California trial, Wal-Mart believed that punitive damages could not be recovered in this case.\nJuror Jeff Pector, a 52-year-old software developer, said he and several other jurors believed that the punitive damage award should have been higher.\n\"Wal-Mart, in my opinion, had clear knowledge of what the law was requiring, full, timely, uninterrupted meal breaks, and from the top down to the store manager, it seemed that there was disregard for the laws that were passed in California,\" Pector said in an interview after the verdict was announced. \"We wanted to send a very clear message that in California, even really big companies need to follow the law.\"\nLast year Wal-Mart settled a similar lawsuit by workers in its"}

The freed-up money will go toward buying mortgages of struggling homeowners, enabling them to refinance into more affordable loans.\nThe capital requirement for each company will be reduced from the current 30 percent to 20 percent, and further reductions will be considered in the future. Fannie and Freddie will raise additional capital through special sales of stock or cuts in dividends.\nIt was the third step the government has taken in recent weeks to allow Washington-based Fannie and McLean, Va.-based Freddie to shoulder larger burdens in the mortgage market despite their multibillion-dollar fourth-quarter losses and expectations of further red ink this year.\nThe $168 billion economic stimulus package enacted last month included a temporary increase in the cap on mortgages that the companies can purchase or guarantee, from $417,000 to $729,750 in high-cost markets. And, as a reward for filing timely financial statements following multibillion-dollar accounting scandals, Fannie and Freddie were freed on March 1 of a combined $1.5 trillion cap on their mortgage-investment holdings.\nOFHEO estimated that the combination of these efforts should allow Fannie and Freddie to purchase or guarantee roughly $2 trillion in mortgages this year.\nThe two companies together hold or guarantee around $4.9 trillion in home-loan debt. As the mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch have worsened in recent months, policy makers have increasingly looked to them to step up their participation in the hobbled market for securities backed by mortgages.\n\"This is what (Fannie and Freddie) were put in place for. ... And we will deliver,\" Freddie Mac Chairman and CEO Richard Syron said.\nInfluential Democratic lawmakers have been pushing for a reduction in the companies' capital-holding requirements. Bush administration officials and numerous Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, have long opposed allowing Fannie and Freddie to take on more debt, contending that doing so could threaten the global financial system."}

The Next case forms such a tight seal around your Pixel that you need a special key (included in the box) to take the case apart.\nThe case has colored sides that will also add a a bit of bulk to the Pixel 3, but LifeProof promises that it will protect your phone from dirt, dust, debris, and snow\u2014basically anything but water. But that's OK, because the Pixel has its own IP68 water resistance.\nAt $80, the LifeProof Next case isn't cheap, but you likely won't need to buy another case again.\nWhy we love it: Otterbox cases are big, bulky, and unapologetically rugged, so you know what you're getting with the Defender. The interior of the case consists of two pieces of plastic that snap together to cover your phone, which is then placed into another layer for full protection. This particular case doesn't come with a screen protector, but a thick border frames the display to keep the screen from scratching when you accidentally bump it. The buttons are also a little hard to press at first, but they loosen up after some extended use.\nWhy we love it: Making a rugged case that\u2019s not huge is hard. The Symmetry Series from Otterbox attempts to do just that, and for the most part, gets it right. The case has a sturdy, rugged feel to it, without the bulk of something like the Defender series"}

Cities restricted the number of cars on the road, coal-fired power plants reduced or shut and replaced by natural gas which decreased nearly 40 percent of the concentration of the contaminant.\nBut, a recent study of environmental data revealed a rise in the harmful ground-level ozone pollution especially in large cities, with a drop in the PM 2.5.\nAs it turns out, when it comes to the war on air pollution, chemistry is a formidable foe.\nOzone is the main ingredient in smog and has been studied since it began choking cities in the U.S. in the early 1950s. \"Ozone is formed through a series of chemical reactions, starting with the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This reaction forms chemical radicals, which drives reactions among oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and VOCs to produce ozone in the presence of sunlight. Both NOx and VOCs are emitted from fossil fuel combustion, and VOCs can also be emitted from industrial sources.\nThe researchers from the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (NUIST) found that particulate matter acts like a sponge for the radicals needed to generate ozone pollution, sucking them up and preventing them from producing ozone.\n\"There was so much particulate matter in Chinese cities that it stunted the ozone production,\" said Daniel Jacob, the Vasco McCoy Family Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, and co-corresponding author of the study.\nBut the rapid reduction of PM 2.5 dramatically altered the chemistry of the atmosphere, leaving more radicals available to produce ozone.\n\"We haven't observed this happening anywhere else because no other country has moved this quickly to reduce particulate matter emissions,\" said Jacob. \"It took China four years to do what took 30 years in the U.S.\"\nDespite this rapid reduction, China still has a long way to go to meet its air quality goals.\n\"As PM 2.5 levels continue to fall, ozone is going to keep getting worse,\" said Ke Li, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and first author of the study.\n\"Results from this study suggest that extra efforts are needed to reduce NOx and VOC emissions in order to stem the tide of ozone pollution\", said Professor Hong Liao at NUIST who is the co-corresponding author of this work."}

He later explained he was remembering his late father.\nThe same picture, though without the bat, hangs from the tower with these words inscribed on top: \"Congratulations for your 35th glorious Test century.\" The Indian cricket board and the Gujarat Cricket Association honoured Tendulkar with mementos before the Test started here onSaturday."}

The toll is set to be about 85 lower than a decade ago and experts say it could fall to 200 within 10 years.\nPolice Deputy Commissioner Ken Lay said policing of problems such as drink driving had been toughened to match the rhetoric of TAC advertising campaigns, helping to cut fatalities by up to 30 per cent at Easter and other times throughout the year.\nA boost in the hours that mobile speed cameras operate - from 6000 to 9000 hours a month - had also contributed to the result, along with number plate recognition technology.\nLast year, 40 drivers killed on Victorian roads were unlicensed, suspended or disqualified. Number plate scanning, used for a full year for the first time, has helped remove these drivers. Victorian roads are among the safest in the world but 2009 is set to be the first time the toll has been lower than 300 since the records began in 1952.\nThis contrasts with NSW, where fatalities hit 451 last week - an increase of 90 deaths over the year - and New Zealand, where deaths have risen by 24 to 370, despite it having 1.1 million fewer people than Victoria.\nMr Lay said new vehicle technology, like electronic stability control and curtain airbags, was becoming increasingly common and would help achieve a toll of fewer than 200 deaths by 2019.\nBut he said the achievements this year had been tarnished by the loss of life since the Christmas holiday season began. Already 11 lives have been lost on Victoria's roads since December 18. An 87-year-old man died yesterday from injuries sustained in a two-car collision in Vermont South on Christmas Day.\nTAC road safety manager Samantha Cockfield said safety experts were constantly dismayed by high-risk behaviour but Victoria's road toll had nevertheless plummeted from a high of 1061 in 1970. She said around $70 million provided annually by the TAC to fund road upgrades in high-risk areas had contributed to improvements.\nBut despite the drop in the road toll, 927 people spent more than a fortnight in hospital because of a road accident in the 12 months to July this year - a hidden toll that is likely to cost the TAC about $464 million over the patients' lifetimes.\nBruce Corben, from the Monash University Accident Research Centre, said that deaths among vulnerable road users, including motorcyclists and pedestrians, had decreased this year.\nThe toll currently stands at 289, compared with 301 this time last year."}

Credit for that goes mostly to the state Department of Transportation, which designed the project and managed the construction.\nConsultants included HDR Inc. for preliminary engineering; INCA Engineers and Adolfson Environmental. The contractor was Mowat Construction Co. of Woodinville.\nDirect-access ramps in Bellevue, which link the Bellevue Transit Center to Interstate 405, are scheduled to open next month.

What\u2019s wrong with a little technological tinkering during class?\nAll right, let\u2019s assume that you can play in the digital sandbox all day long, right through work, right through the commute, and then all through your evening grad school class. The question then becomes, how can that person teaching the class \u2014 you know, that guy who was up until 2:00 a.m. the night before putting together four hours of compelling information that you\u2019re about to Twitter through \u2014 how can that professor leverage your inclination to multi-task several different technological platforms and improve your educational experience?\nSaid professor wants to know why (I say \u201cif\u201d) the shine is off that oldest of delivery systems in the classroom: Face-to-face communication.

Numerous educational studies have determined we all learn in different ways. I have found during this round of my education all of the technology and side chatter really is value-added. I find myself with a deeper engagement with the subject and the instructor. Instead of fighting the future we should look at ways of harnessing and utilizing the technology and further enhance the communication of thoughts and ideas.\nSeveral weeks ago we concluded class with this conversation, and I\u2019ve considered it numerous times since then.\n1.\tPeople learn in different ways.

That\u2019s why Peter hid Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) in the Russian clinic \u2013 he did it to save his life. Now, Peter wants to clean up his father\u2019s mess.\nThe science behind the memory-mapping process is pretty ridiculous, so GH fans shouldn\u2019t be surprised when Peter (aka Henrik the Traitor) goes into the files on the flash drive and tries to erase himself from Drew\u2019s stored memories. Peter\u2019s only concern is that Drew can identify him as Faison\u2019s son, and that\u2019s information Peter does not want to be known.

Jason is already certain that Drew knows Henrik\u2019s identity, but he can\u2019t recall. It\u2019s true that Peter was there when Drew\u2019s memories were taken and Jason\u2019s implanted.

However, it must be at the back of Jason\u2019s mind that if Drew gets his memories back, he might not stay with Sam. After all, Drew has another baby mama, and rumor has it there\u2019s another wife out there.\nWhile Jason does want to know what happened after Faison kidnapped him five years ago, his intentions might not be entirely pure. Jason may be hoping Drew has a \u201clove of his life\u201d from his past that would pull him away from Sam. On Monday\u2019s GH, Drew convinced Sam that they need to find the flash drive with his memories, so they have the option of restoring his memories if it\u2019s even possible. Sam was hoping that the memory stick would stay hidden, but unfortunately, it won\u2019t.\nThe latest GH spoilers promise that as soon as Jason finds the flash drive, he goes to Drew to let him know they have the key to finding Henrik and recovering Drew\u2019s old life. Drew doesn\u2019t even hesitate. He wants his memories back but thinks there is no way it will impact his new life with Sam. For her part, Sam is terrified that Drew will lose his new memories from the past three years, including their love story and the birth of their child.\nPeter leaving the flash drive for Jason to find is only part of the story.

It\u2019s the most high-profile case yet of cyber extortion using ransomware.\nMalicious software can infect computers when someone clicks on a link to a booby-trapped website, or opens an attachment in a phishing email. Ransomware is malware that typically encrypts all the files stored on a system and then demands payment to unlock them.\nThe attack on Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles effectively knocked it offline. As a result, patients had to be diverted to other hospitals, medical records were kept using pen and paper, and staff resorted to communicating by fax. Although they settled for far less, the hackers had reportedly demanded 9000 bitcoins \u2013 around $3.6 million.\n\u201cRansomware has really exploded in the last couple of years,\u201d says Steve Santorelli, a former UK police detective now at threat intelligence firm Team Cymru, based in Florida. One ransomware package, CryptoLocker 3.0, is thought to have earned attackers $325 million in 2015 alone.\n\u201cThese guys are sophisticated,\u201d says Jake Williams, the founder of cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec.

It would appear that Hollywood Presbyterian was not so well prepared, and it had to shut down its network after the attack.\nFor hospitals in particular, the goal of some attacks may be not so much to withhold files as to grab what they contain. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen malware in healthcare environments that\u2019s been able to steal patients\u2019 information,\u201d says Williams.

{"idx": "39072", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Virtual reality entails presenting our senses with a computer generated virtual environment that we can explore in some fashion. A new study uses the technique to help neuroscientists obtain insight into how different brain areas assemble memories in context.\nUsing a virtual reality environment to train subjects, researchers from University of California discovered a key brain area, the hippocampus, is involved or activated in a variety of memory tasks.\nIt\u2019s well known that one memory can trigger related memories. We remember specific events with context \u2014 when and where it happened, who was there. Different memories can also have specific context, as well as information that is the same between memories \u2014 for example, events that occurred in the same location.\nGraduate student Halle Dimsdale-Zucker and Professor Charan Ranganath at the University of California, Davis Center for Neuroscience and Department of Psychology studied how the brain assembles all the pieces of these memories.\nThey use functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to look for brain areas that are activated as memories are recalled, especially in the hippocampus, a small structure in the center of the brain.\nFor this study, Dimsdale-Zucker used architectural sketching software to build houses in a 3-D virtual environment. The subjects watched a series of videos in which they went into one house then another.\nIn each video, different objects were positioned within the houses. The subjects therefore memorized the objects in two contexts: which video (episodic memory) and which house (spatial memory).\nIn the second phase of the study, the subjects were asked to try to remember the objects while they were scanned by fMRI. Being asked about the objects spontaneously reactivated contextual information, Dimsdale-Zucker said.\nShe discovered different regions of the hippocampus were activated for different kinds of information: One area, CA1, was associated with representing shared information about contexts (e.g., objects that were in the same video); another, distinct area was linked to representing differences in context.\nAnother interesting finding was that in this study, the hippocampus was involved in episodic memories linking both time and space, she said.\nThis observation was contrary to conventional beliefs that the hippocampus codes primarily for spatial memories, for example those involved in navigation.\nVirtual reality makes it possible to carry out controlled laboratory experiments with episodic memory, Dimsdale-Zucker said.\nThe knowledge gained on how memories are formed, stored and recalled could eventually lead to better diagnosis and treatment for memory problems in aging or degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease."}

He was 91.\nHe also wrote numerous screenplays, some of them originals, some adaptations of his stage work. But he was best known as a playwright, both for his long string of Gotham shows as well as countless productions by regional and amateur theater companies, which helped him become the most-performed playwright of his era.\nAt a time when the legitimate theater was in decline and devoted American playwrights an endangered species, Simon stood head and shoulders above the rest. His early comedic successes, such as \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d and \u201cBarefoot in the Park,\u201d were both critically well received and financially successful, and even some critics who found him glib and formulaic could not deny his craftsmanship and the sheer volume of his output.\nSimon once said that he was a disciplined writer, sitting at a typewriter for eight hours and constantly banging on the keys even if he was writing gibberish, because he needed the regularity of constantly writing.\nSimon never much wandered from his roots. And even when his plays were geographically distant from his New York-Jewish background, the sensibility remained in the approach to comedy and the characters that inhabited his pieces. A Neil Simon comedy was as identifiable as the work of any other major American playwright, whether O\u2019Neill, Williams or Philip Barry.\nIn addition to his screen adaptations of plays, he wrote original motion picture scripts including \u201cThe Goodbye Girl,\u201d the 1972 \u201cThe Heartbreak Kid\u201d (adapted from Bruce Jay Friedman\u2019s story) and 1976\u2019s \u201cMurder by Death.\u201d But he maintained a fervor and enthusiasm for the theater that made him unique in the era of television and film.\nSimon got his start in TV, as one of the writers on \u201cYour Show of Shows,\u201d the landmark comedic variety show of the 1950s that starred Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. His colleagues included Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart and Mel Brooks.\nMarvin Neil Simon was born on the Fourth of July, in the Bronx. He was dubbed Doc as a young boy \u2014 he had a habit of imitating the family doctor \u2014 and it stuck, long after people forgot his original first name, Marvin.\nHe and older brother Danny first began writing comedy skits when Doc was only 15. After a stint in the Army, he and Danny were reunited at Warner Bros. Danny was working in publicity and his brother in the mailroom. Simon got his BA from NYU in 1946.\nTiring of the sausage factory atmosphere of collaborative TV writing, Simon struck out on his own after writing and rewriting the play \u201cCome Blow Your Horn\u201d about 15 times. It landed on Broadway and became his first success in 1961, earning him $1,000 a week and freedom from television.\nSimon then penned the book for the Sid Caesar-starring musical \u201cLittle Me\u201d in 1962, followed by his first major success, \u201cBarefoot in the Park,\u201d in 1963.

The new rules also ask companies to explain cases where their chairperson\u2019s tenure exceeds nine years, calls on boards to scrutinize company culture and presses management to respond to any corporate governance-related issues.\nThe regulator said it \u201cwishes to see clear, meaningful reporting\u201d and criticized the \u201ctick-box approach\u201d pursued by some executives.\nCompanies have to provide additional information to shareholders on a number of issues starting from Jan. 1, 2019, for example on how governance contributes to the long-term success of the business. Companies must also address cases in which more than 20% of investors vote against a resolution brought forward by the management. \u201cThis is one of the areas where we have seen weak reporting,\u201d said David Styles, the FRC\u2019s director of corporate governance.\nThe code stipulates companies should engage more with their workforce. The board can achieve this by appointing a director from the workforce, creating a formal workforce advisory panel or by naming a designated non-executive director.\nThe FRC currently lacks the power to punish companies whose conduct violates the code. A government review of the regulator\u2019s role -- set to conclude by the end of the year -- could result in additional enforcement powers for the FRC, said Mr. Styles.\nThe code does not include specific targets for representation of minorities or gender on boards and does not require companies to reveal their leadership diversity figures.\n\u201cReporting on diversity is extremely important,\u201d said Mr. Styles, adding that more work needs to be done on how to report on diversity in practice before a provision can be entered to the code.\nThe FRC has come under pressure after a number of corporate scandals, including the sudden collapse of construction and outsourcing firm Carillion PLC in January. The regulator has commenced several investigations into company accounts and the quality of audits conducted by the Big Four accounting firms. It suggested an inquiry into the case of breaking up these firms in March.\nThe revamp is \u201cprobably the most extensive rewrite of the code in its quarter of a century life to date,\u201d said Anthony Carey, head of board practice at Mazars LLP, an advisory and accounting firm.\nPrime Minister Theresa May in 2016 vowed to crack down on corporate misbehavior and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy last year followed through with a new set of guidelines on executive pay and worker representation.\n\u201cThese changes will drive improvements in how boardrooms engage with employees, customers and suppliers as well as shareholders, delivering better business performance and public confidence in the way businesses are run,\u201d U.K. Government Business Secretary Greg Clark said in a statement."}

Clearly, property investors, flippers, and redevelopers of older properties are seeing a real benefit with using bridging loans.\nWill bridging loans grow in 2019? Let\u2019s consider this now.\nHow Do Property Investors Use Bridging Loans?\nBridging loans are there to provide short-term financing. They are often used for a loan while waiting for development funds to come through, which allows a developer to move ahead sooner with a property restoration project. It can also allow for the purchase of properties opportunistically at auction too.\nImagine that you\u2019re selling one property and waiting for the funds to clear. You visit an auction and spot a house that you\u2019re interested in. The problem is that a deposit for the property is 10 percent of the winning bid and there is only four weeks to find the other 90 percent. To get a mortgage in that time, especially on an older property that\u2019s required to clear a property inspection, is next to impossible. In this situation, a bridging loan is an ideal solution.\nA website like bridgingloans.co.uk can help locate a suitable lender that will be willing to make such a loan to back the purchase.\nAre Property Investors Strictly Buy-to-Let or Opportunistic?\nIt used to be that UK property investors aimed at the buy-to-let market because it was fairly simple. This left the professional property investors who did it for a living to put their time into the development, restoration, auction purchases, and so on. However, that\u2019s now all changing.\nIn many property markets, there are too many buy-to-let investors. People have fallen in love with owning rental properties. As a result, the rental yields have come under pressure as property prices have risen. Cash flowing a property, especially one with debt attached to it, is more difficult now.\nExtra profits must be found elsewhere to augment returns. For more adventurous private property buyers, they\u2019re seeing fewer bargains in local markets and have increasingly been looking for new opportunities. Because of this, conventional fodder for property companies is now fertile land to plough for investors on the hunt for a bargain to boost their total returns.\nBridging loans are never supposed to be used as long-term property financing. This isn\u2019t their purpose. That\u2019s what a mortgage is used for. When needing short-term funding for solid properties, plan for the bridging loan you need and where the replacement funding will come from to repay it on time. Doing so avoids paying more than is necessary in finance costs and keeps you on budget too.\nAs the interest in property investing as a way to diversify away from the stock market continues, investors use bridging loans to cover funding gaps. This way, they can grab that bargain property at auction and know they can secure it before another eager buyer does."}

If a lot more reactors are built, and the demand for uranium siginificantly increases, more of it might come from less-secure sources. In anticipation of a nuclear renaissance, investors tempted by speculative price increases during the last decade have been searching for uranium in places off the beaten track, including in northern Mali where France is now at war with Al Qaeda insurgents.\nWhat were investors thinking about risk when they stepped into remote parts of northern and eastern Mali beginning a few years ago? Maybe something like what you\u2019ll find in the introductory pages of the current (2009) edition of the Lonely Planet guide to West Africa, which says about this country: \u201cThe Tuareg rebellion that began in 2006 seems to have almost run its course\u2026 on many fronts Mali is a model of West African democracy, one in which the overall health of the system has proven more enduring than the ambitions of individual leaders.\u201d To be fair, the fine print deep inside the guidebook urges caution on travel in remote areas, and I can easily imagine a careful editor three years ago having inserted that qualifier almost in the sentence I cited above. But the windfall of arms from Libya, unfulfilled and intensifying Tuareg grievances, and the arrival of Al Qaida were clearly not anticipated.\nIn 2007, Oklo Resources Ltd, a company listed on the Australia Stock Exchange, started up a uranium exploration in Kidal, located in the desert northeast of the country near the Algerian border. The Mali government told the IAEA in 2009 that the Kidal project covers an area about 20,000 square kilometers. How far did it get before Islamists came knocking in northern Mali? Not very far. According to the \u201cRed Book\u201d on global uranium production and resources, the Kidal site was idle beginning in the last quarter of 2011 because of \u201cpolitical unrest\u201d although the company planned to begin a drilling program in May, 2012.\nAn investor listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Rockgate Capital, is now in charge of a property French firm Areva (actually its predecessor Cogema) dabbled with many years ago, called Falea. The Red Book says that in 2012 Rockgate planned to continue exploring for silver, copper, and uranium at that site, which may contain identified and inferred uranium resources totalling about 10,000 tons. The Red Book suggests that political unrest may also have been a factor investors had to consider at this site, although it is located considerably to the south and west of France\u2019s theater of operations against insurgents. Efforts to drill at the site have for several years encountered political opposition supported by Greens in the European Parliament.\nThere is no uranium production in Mali today. If you had plunked down hard cash in Mali uranium properties five years ago, you might currently regret that decision, but Mali\u2019s uranium resource base would hardly justify the conspiracy theory floated in some quarters of cyberspace this month that France is going to war in Mali to protect Areva\u2019s access to uranium there.\n"}

Major cities throughout the Bay Area spent the fall preparing for the madness, and have established coordination centers throughout the area.\nOfficials would not disclose to WIRED exactly how they plan to keep tabs on Super Bowl 50, but privacy experts agree that given that this is an all-hands-on-deck effort, law enforcement almost certainly is using all available technology to ensure everything goes as planned.\nNorthern California law enforcement is always on the cutting edge of new surveillance technologies.\nOf course, the FBI and DHS and an alphabet soup of other agencies are bringing their own equipment. Not that they're saying anything about it. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to speak on the technological side of what we have,\u201d says Officer Albie Esparza of the SFPD. The NFL isn't talking, either. Though they'd like you to. \"The basic bottom line,\" Officer Esparza added, \"is that our best eyes and ears are the public who come and participate. If someone sees something, we are asking people to say something.\"\nStill, various public records provide some insight into the gear that Bay Area police use, and the surveillance equipment and software the feds use. Here's what we know.\nAs the government pointed out back in 2014, Automatic license plate readers (ALPR) are fairly ubiquitous in Bay Area law enforcement. You'll find them on utility poles and mounted on police cars. The devices can, as the name suggests, read a plate and record the location, time, and date. This data is stored in a database, allowing law enforcement to track where you drive, how often, and how long you spend at a particular place. Over time, that information can reveal details about where you live and work, where"}

More often, people have believed to have found the next incarnation of Jobs only to be disappointed. Perhaps you can help me determine if the subject of this article could become the Steve Jobs of impact investing.\nFrom my perch in Salt Lake City on the west side of the Rockies, over the last few years I've been hearing rumblings from the other side of the mountains. In Denver, Dr. Stephanie Gripne has created one of the most dynamic centers of impact investing and social entrepreneurship in the world. With a goal to catalyze impact investments of over $1 trillion and a plan to get there, it is about time that people outside the Rocky Mountains took note.\nDr. Gripne founded the Impact Finance Center as a partnership between the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business and the Sustainable Endowments Institute, a special project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.\nIn 2014, the Center launched the CO Impact Days and Initiative with a three year goal to catalyze $100 million of impact investment in Colorado-based social ventures. The event has grown into a marketplace for impact investing.\nWendi Burkhardt, co-founder and CEO of the Colorado-based social enterprise Silvernest was an early participant in CO Impact Days. She says, \"I am inspired by the opportunities that Stephanie and IFC are creating to employ traditional philanthropic donations as capital investments that offer a substantial return and thereby further the impact and intention of the applied funds. I\u2019m excited by this untapped opportunity to bring these worlds together.\"\nWill Morgan, Director of Impact for Sonen Capital, has worked with Dr. Gripne for several years, providing grant funding for the Center. He sees the need for the infrastructure that the Center is working to create. \"I think IFC's work is great. Investors are searching for more meaning with their assets and resources. Social enterprises and private businesses that create positive impacts are starved for resources. It's a natural thought that more infrastructure needs to be put into place so that both sides of the equation can get what they need,\" he says.\nJeramy Lund, Managing Director of the Sorenson Impact Center at University of Utah, agrees. He notes that she drove great collaboration. He says, the CO Impact Days event was a big success. \"The way she was able to bring together the major foundations and get them to agree on collective impact was impressive heavy lifting. To pull it off on the first year was amazing.\"\nDr. Gripne isn't working to create a marketplace for impact capital by leveraging her Wall Street experience. She doesn't have any formal finance training or experience.\nRejecting her father's business career as path for her life, Dr. Gripne earned a PhD in Wildlife Conservation at the University of Montana. Her early career had working in academia, the Journal of Wildlife Management, the USDA Forest Service and the DOE Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It isn't clear when she learned to calculate the present value of an investment.\nIt was working with her father, however, that she learned about the power of doing good with investment dollars. \" Before my dad passed, we completed some of my first direct impact investment deals together.

I\u2019ve just been told they are marrying (in July) in a Mormon temple near Salt Lake City, but non-Mormons are not allowed to go to the ceremony.\nIt seems there is an additional ceremony organised for those people who were not able (because of the rule, or any other reason) to attend the wedding.\nThis is called the Ring Ceremony but it takes place AFTER the wedding. In my son\u2019s case his temple wedding is at 11am and the Ring Ceremony is at 6pm.\nI am not a Mormon and, therefore, apparently not worthy of going into the temple and seeing him get married, but, of course, her whole family will be there.\nMy son will have no family allowed there, not that there are many of us. I am very upset by the fact that I won\u2019t see my only child get married, but when I raised the issue, he was very matter of fact, saying he didn\u2019t think I was religious or into legal things.\nI don\u2019t seem to be able to get through to him that I would like to see him get married.\nI suggested the Ring Ceremony could be earlier and then the temple wedding, as we would all get to see them together, but he said that would mean the other non-Mormon people having the time changed on them.\nI said I was upset but, actually, I\u2019m devastated \u2014 though unsure whether it is because I want see him get married, or because of his total lack of understanding of my feelings. It\u2019s been a shock because we have always been close.\nI\u2019m gutted that the support I gave the church by supporting my son is not acknowledged and that the family values they seem to espouse are not being fulfilled.

Since you have been everything to him throughout his youth, this would be tragic.\nI have no doubt whatsoever that you should travel to Salt Lake City and be there for your only child, because that will matter to him.\nThis is his new life, and whatever your private feelings might be, you must support him \u2014 just as you always have.\nI\u2019m afraid suggesting they re-arrange the timings is far from supportive, even a tad (I\u2019m sorry\u2026) selfish.

It is probable that he was as well known abroad, especially in Holland and England, where Marcel Proust Societies have recently been formed, as in Paris, where his work was enjoyed by a select minority. His style was difficult and obscure, and his intricate, exquisitely delicate meditations and analysis of emotions could never have appealed to the mass of readers. Outwardly and in his habits he was a strange being. Very pale, with burning black eyes, frail and short in stature, he lived like a hermit in his home, which was open to a few privileged friends, amongst precious furniture. Yet by fits and starts he loved to re-enter the fashionable \"night-life\" of Paris. His apartment was lined throughout with cork in an ineffectual attempt to keep out the uproar of the noisiest city in the world.

There was a time when children went on crusades to the Holy Land. Mr. Chesterton affects to wonder that we do not do so now. We do not; and Mr. Chesterton may take the postures of a Crusader and imagine a crowd about him if he will; he is not persuasive.

Welfare seems to be one of the last areas of government purview to receive its very own working group, perhaps because Cabinet is acting only because of the MPs' post-election agreement with the Greens rather than from any particular driving motivation of their own.\nStill, good on the Green Party for making this happen. I just hope that ultimately the work of the WEAG becomes more than a sop to a junior partner and yet another report consigned to parliament\u2019s very own over-flowing dustbin.\nIn my pre-Budget article for Pundit I spoke optimistically about any such advisory group reporting back within three months, such is the urgency needed for action. The deadline WEAG members have been given is February 2019. Cabinet will decide on the Government response to their recommendations in March and it is likely that any resulting legislation and/or other financial changes will not see the light of day until after next year\u2019s Budget in May.\nThis means any real change could be well over a year away.\nMeanwhile, those who in various ways depend on Work & Income have no option but to survive within the constraints of nine years of National\u2019s welfare reforms and Labour\u2019s own earlier destructive changes, including its transformation in 2007 of the purpose of social security from a safety net for the most vulnerable to its positioning of paid work as the ultimate goal of welfare.\nWhat this means is that the crippling laws which govern the operation of Work & Income, filled with nitpicking sanctions and a focus on treating many beneficiaries as potential criminals via a focus on investigating fraud \u2013 particularly in the area of personal relationships \u2013 continues.\nAt a minimum, Labour could and should do two things now. First, they should have the nerve to stick to the other key part of their welfare agreement with the Greens by withdrawing the law which means sole parents who don\u2019t name the father of their child have part of their benefit cut each week. Over 13,000 women and 17,000 children are affected by this.\nSecond, root and branch culture change should be implemented within Work & Income and MSD, from the top down. I have sympathy for the PSA\u2019s position that the WEAG should have included a workers\u2019 voice, as frontline staff are those most effected by current policy and law, alongside the people they serve.\nGiven that there will be such a long waiting period before any action is considered as a result of the WEAG process, the least Government could do is to kick-start culture change. This needs to happen through high quality training and adequate resourcing for staff aimed at ensuring people who come to Work & Income for help are treated fairly and with respect, and that the default position is to give people the full assistance to which they are legally entitled.\nProfessor Cindy Kiro ( Chair) \u2013 highly respected academic and former Children\u2019s Commissioner.\nProfessor Innes Asher \u2013 a senior paediatrician with a long record of professional experience working with children and families and a long-standing advocate with the Child Poverty Action Group.\nKay Brereton \u2013 experienced beneficiary advocate, with lived experience in the benefit system.\nDr Huhana Hickey \u2013 scholar and activist in the area of disabilities research and advocacy, with lived experience in the benefit system.\nProfessor Tracey McInstosh \u2013 head of Sociology at the University of Auckland with a particular interest in sociology concerning M\u0101ori communities.\nDr Ganesh Nana \u2013 Chief"}

But Pentagon officials are known to have visited a number of sites to assess their potential utility for this purpose, and both the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office have speculated on a number of others.\nEastern Europe: According to the CBO the Pentagon is interested in the establishment of three or more forward operat\u00ading locations in Eastern Europe. In Poland it is looking into the use of several facilities once occupied by Soviet forces. In Romania much attention has been paid to the air base at Mihail Kogalniceanu and the Black Sea port of Constanta. Both were used to ferry troops and equipment to Iraq, and Secretary Rumsfeld visited these facilities in October to weigh their future utilization by American forces.\nCentral Asia and the Caucasus: The Pentagon currently maintains two forward operating locations in this region: at Khanabad in southern Uzbekistan and at Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. These bases are being used to support combat operations in Afghanistan, and the Pentagon has indicated that it plans to retain them for some time to come. In addition, the United States is refurbishing the former Soviet air base at Atyrau, on Kazakhstan\u2019s Caspian Sea coast; the White House says this facility could be used by US and Kazakh troops for \u201cjoint training in the area of counter-terrorism.\u201d The Defense Department is also considering the acquisition of a similar facility in Azerbaijan, which is now receiving US funds for the creation of its own Caspian Sea navy.\nPersian Gulf: America\u2019s elaborate basing infrastructure in the Gulf area will be expanded with the acquisition of permanent facilities in Iraq. More than a year ago, the Chicago Tribune revealed that US military engineers are busy construct\u00ading fourteen \u201cenduring bases\u201d for American forces in Iraq. These facilities are said to include an assortment of former Iraqi army bases; the airports at Baghdad and Mosul will also be expanded to house US military aircraft. Elsewhere in the region, the Pentagon will retain its facilities in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The large air base at Al-Udeid in Qatar is being expanded to house the US personnel once stationed in Saudi Arabia.\nAfrica: The Pentagon has already established two forward operating locations in North Africa: At Tamanrasset Airport in southern Algeria and at Camp Lemonier, a former French Foreign Legion post in Djibouti. It is also looking at possible sites for \u201cbare bones\u201d facilities in several countries south of the Sahara, including Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda, as well as S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in the Gulf of Guinea.\nAsia and the Pacific: Under plans announced by President Bush last August, the Pentagon will redeploy about 12,500 combat troops from South Korea to Iraq and shift the remaining US forces in South Korea from Seoul and its environs to less congested areas farther south. The first step was taken to enhance security in Iraq\u2019s beleaguered cities, and the second to reduce US forces\u2019 vulnerability to North Korea\u2019s long-range artillery and to afford greater maneuverability in the event of a war.

Photo courtesy of Peggy Haun.\nFour Coastie families have shared their experiences here to help others find their way to the services they need as easily and efficiently as possible. They are part of the more than 3,000 family members enrolled in the program.\nBut she is also mom to three kids enrolled in the SNP. She has a son, 12, and two daughters, 6 and 1. When her middle daughter was born, the Conleys quickly realized she had special medical needs.\nAnd that support was waiting for them when their second daughter was born, and again they needed additional medical support for her. After that, her son was placed on the autism spectrum, so they enrolled him for both medical and educational purposes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an essential program for Coast Guard families who have dependents with special needs,\u201d Conley said.\nAll of that personal experience has served her well in helping families in her care as an ombudsman. Conley said she finds that many families express their worries that enrolling in the program will have a detrimental effect on their active duty member\u2019s career because it will limit the locations to which they can be transferred.\n\u201cI\u2019m finding that a lot of them are concerned that perhaps it is viewed negatively, or it may have career implications, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Conley said.\nConley describes it not only as a medical support system, but also an assignment tool that ensures that families don\u2019t end up in locations that can\u2019t provide the medical care they need.\n\u201cIt\u2019s handled in a very private and respectful manner, and really provides resources and support when the family needs it,\u201d she said.\nFor families unsure of whether to enroll, Conley recommends reaching out to a family resource specialist in the program to ask questions \u2013 their contact information is here.\nRachel and James Conley with their children, from left, Caroline, 1, Clara, 6, and Will, 12. Photo courtesy of Rachel Conley.\nOnce enrolled, Conley said, the active duty member\u2019s record was flagged showing there was a special need that affected the transfer process. The assignment officer saw the flag and contacted the family resource specialist, or FRS, working with the family to gain some guidance on what special considerations that family needs before transferring. The FRS FRS then weighed in on whether the appropriate support can be provided at the prospective locations. That process is right in the middle of changing.\nOne caveat Conley added was that being a part of the special needs program does not preclude an active duty member from deploying, standing duty, or taking unaccompanied assignments. Her family knows first-hand \u2013 her husband will be taking an unaccompanied assignment for a year.\nThe process for determining PCS locations for families enrolled in SNP is currently being revamped, and the new process will be in effect by February 2016, according to Marta Denchfield, Ph.D., the Special Needs Program manager. The previous process, in which the records were flagged, did not describe the complexity of a family\u2019s needs. So a new categorization program launched a few months ago.\nFamilies in the special needs program will be assigned category numbers, based on the complexity of their medical needs. For example, a category one need might be seasonal allergies or hypertension, which would mean no limit to services or assignment locations. At the other end of the spectrum, a category five need might be complicated cancer treatment or severe cases of autism, which would require access"}

He cited the fallout from escalating tariff battles with the United States and the impact of tougher new lending standards in Canada on mortgage renewals and the housing market.\n\u201cWe expect these issues to figure prominently in our upcoming deliberations,\u201d Mr. Poloz said as he wrapped up a speech in Victoria that was focused on the central bank\u2019s efforts to improve transparency.\nMost economists expect the pain from U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to be relatively modest. A recent C.D. Howe working paper, for example, estimated Canada\u2019s economy would take a 0.33-per-cent hit to GDP growth and lose 6,000 jobs. But Canada is poised to respond on July 1 with retaliatory tariffs that could impose costs on both sides of the border. The United States is also threatening additional tariffs on Canada\u2019s auto industry, which is much larger than steel and aluminum.\nNew, stricter mortgage rules that took effect in January have cooled the country\u2019s hottest housing markets, but have not precipitated the kind of crash many analysts had feared.\nThe Bank of Canada has raised its benchmark interest rate three times since last June \u2013 to 1.25 per cent from 0.5 per cent \u2212 as the economy neared full capacity and inflation approached its key target of 2 per cent.\nJust before Mr. Poloz\u2019s speech, Bloomberg\u2019s monetary policy tracker rated the odds of a July 11 rate hike at 60.7 per cent.\nSpeaking to reporters after the speech, Mr. Poloz pointed out that economic growth and inflation are still evolving largely as the bank expected in its April forecast. And he said the central bank would not be swayed by less important indicators or political rhetoric.\nOn Friday, the bank is set to release its next business outlook survey \u2013 a summary of how business leaders see economic conditions. It\u2019s typically the last piece of information that precedes rate decisions.\nMr. Poloz said the central bank can still improve its communication efforts, which have at times confused investors and analysts.\nAmong the unknowns, Mr. Poloz cited the impact of trade wars on business investment and how Canada\u2019s heavily indebted households will cope with higher borrowing costs.\nMr. Poloz said the bank is also working to make its speeches and documents understandable to a broader audience, according to Mr. Poloz. Polling by the bank suggests that as many as six million Canadians want to know how the economy works but can\u2019t grasp it. Analysis by the bank found that most of its speeches and publications are aimed at people with university degrees, making them inaccessible to many.\nThe central bank started phasing out the practice of signalling its interest-rate moves in 2013."}

Now he\u2019s studying to be a cop.\nBUENA PARK, Calif. \u2014 The bracelet is still on Jonathan Smith\u2019s wrist, right where he put it a year ago as he entered the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. It was there when country star Jason Aldean took the stage, when what sounded like fireworks morphed into a shower of bullets, when the blood started to run down his shirt, when he tried to drag concert\u00adgoers away from danger, when he almost lost his life.\nIt\u2019s a tactile talisman now, along with the bullet still lodged in Smith\u2019s chest, between his shoulder and his heart. The bracelet reminds him of being heralded as a hero for running toward the stage to help others and taking a bullet himself. It reminds him of the viral photograph of his recovery in the hospital, of celebrities and strangers reaching out to send him gifts such as a Purple Heart pin he received from a Vietnam War veteran. It reminds him that it could have ended another way.\nBut there\u2019s so much more no one can see beneath the bracelet: the pain, the emotion, the panic attacks that send him scrambling for a Xanax or pulling over to the side of the road to clutch the black-beaded rosary hanging from his rearview mirror.\nThe Las Vegas massacre, the worst shooting attack in modern U.S. history, is a year behind Smith and the thousands of others who were there Oct. 1, 2017, when a man perched high above in the Mandalay Bay hotel turned a concert into a bloodbath. Fifty-eight people died. There is still no explanation for why the shooting happened nor why the concert was the target.\nThe concert bracelet has proven a key to Smith\u2019s ability to cope. It reminds him how lucky he is to be alive, and it has brought him in contact with more than 100 other survivors who have recognized it while he has been out at his son\u2019s football games, at work or running errands. It gives him purpose as he tries to look forward.\nSmith returned to Las Vegas this past weekend, getting up the courage to drive down the Las Vegas Strip again, determined to look up at the Mandalay Bay\u2019s gold facade and make some kind of peace with everything that has happened since. Though there is a memorial concert planned in Las Vegas \u2014 the attack happened a year ago Monday \u2014 Smith is shunning the formal events because he doesn\u2019t want to be used as a prop. Instead, he\u2019s spending as much time as he can with those who lived through the massacre.\nSmith discovered country music about six years ago and started attending concerts with friends, relishing an expanded personal playlist that ranges from country acts like Aldean to the DJ Quik hip-hop song he recently played in his car. He and his friends managed to score tickets to the Aldean concert last October, thrilled to be able to see the headliner of the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas.\nAs they navigated the nighttime crowd, the group maneuvered toward the stage. They were celebrating the 43rd birthday of Louis Rust, Smith\u2019s friend, and belting out Aldean lyrics.\nWith Aldean on stage, there was a sudden popping noise, what sounded to Smith \u2014 and many others there that night \u2014 like fireworks.

{"idx": "39120", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: WITH only one month to go before a key NATO summit meeting, Western allies are split over the issue of deploying short-range nuclear forces in Europe - and compromise appears remote. The rift threatens the solidarity of the alliance as it engages in wide-ranging arms-control talks with the Warsaw Pact and confronts Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's persuasive public diplomacy in Western Europe.\nMr. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit Bonn in June, two weeks after the May 29-30 summit meeting in Brussels. Defense analysts in London want NATO to resolve the disagreement before the popular Soviet leader again voices his message of a nuclear-free Europe and possibly announces further arms-control initiatives.\nThese analysts are worried that he could turn West European public opinion strongly against NATO's continued deployment of short-range nuclear weapons and weaken an already shaky coalition in West Germany.\nSome British defense officials say that Gorbachev has already driven a wedge between West Germany and other NATO allies. Bonn has suddenly broken with NATO policy and proposed accepting the Warsaw Pact's offer to hold talks on reducing the numbers of NATO's short-range nuclear missiles, including for the first time nuclear artillery. This raises the possibility of the so-called ``third-zero'' option, or the elimination of short-range nuclear weapons from Western Europe.\nThe West German government also wants to postpone any decision on the modernization of short-range nuclear (Lance) missiles until at least 1992 with deployment after 1996, depending on the outcome of arms-control negotiations. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has described these proposals as Bonn's negotiating position within NATO, as it seeks a common policy on mutual defense in the 1990s.\nNATO officials say they thought they had reached an understanding with Bonn on the need for modernization in a document signed last week. But the same day the West German press leaked the text of a secret agreement among the government's coalition partners which called for early talks with Moscow and a postponement on new weapons.\nWest German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher said that his government is united in these proposals. Mr. Genscher is the leading advocate of early talks, while Chancellor Kohl had generally upheld the NATO view.\nWith Kohl's shift in position, apparently under pressure from his political partners, British officials are worried that his right-of-center coalition is unstable, and that elections next year could bring to office a government that is less resolute on defense.\nLondon and Washington oppose the West German proposals, particularly the offer to negotiate reductions in short-range missiles. Their elimination could increase the threat to NATO forces from the Warsaw Pact, British defense officials say.\n``Without short-range nuclear weapons and without reductions in the Warsaw Pact's conventional weapons, NATO would be vulnerable to conventional attack,'' Colonel Duncan says.\nNATO deploys 88 launchers for Lance missiles which, with a range of 150 miles, could interdict tank assaults by the Warsaw Pact. NATO officials have called Lance the ``most credible deterrent'' to Soviet superiority in conventional forces.\nThe alliance policy, previously endorsed by Chancellor Kohl, is that before short-range weapons are placed on the negotiating table, there must be progress in reducing conventional, chemical, and strategic nuclear weapons.\nWith Washington and London united in their opposition to talks on short-range weapons, there appears to be little room for compromise"}

The same player threatened to go on strike a year ago before being persuaded with a lucrative new five-year deal \u2013 one he has made it clear he has no inclinations to honour. Meanwhile, in his absence, the hosts went about their business of beating a poor Fulham side despite missing another so-called vital player for most of the match.\nOf course, after the game, man-of-the- match Morten Gamst Pedersen came out with the perfunctory appeal to the owners to keep players such as Samba at the club after January as \u2018he is vital to the survival of the cause\u2019. But is he really?\nWhat was not being said was actually more telling. Kean, for example, refused to say why there was a twinkle in his eye when he said just enough to make sure we knew that he knew. \u201cHe has texted the doctor and it was disappointing he wasn\u2019t available for this game,\u201d said Kean. \u201cHe trained well all week and we\u2019ll make sure that he gets the proper medication to get over a nasty bug.\nQuite. Rovers, in adversity, showed that they have the character to prove that nobody needs to be missed \u2013 not even your star striker whose goals are all that have stopped you dropping out of sight.\nYakubu was dismissed for an uncharacteristically reckless studs-up challenge on Danny Murphy after just 23 minutes. But here\u2019s the thing; Blackburn, under Kean, actually seem better with 10 men.\nSix players have been sent off since he took charge and not once have the opponents been able to make such a thing count. Four times it has been a goalless stalemate for the rest of the game; and twice \u2013 including Saturday \u2013 Rovers have had the better of the remaining time.\nStrikes from Pedersen and David Dunn briefly looked under threat when Damien Duff pulled one back, but Mauro Formica made sure of the points. \u201cThis is a fantastic feeling after what has been such a tough time, and we haven\u2019t had much luck,\u201d said Pedersen.\n\u201cWe have showed it\u2019s possible after so many negative things going around all over the place.\n\u201cThere are still plenty of tough games coming up for us, but it\u2019s good to just get the victory to help get us out of this.\n\u201cThis was a great victory, and one we fully deserved. It gives us a bit of confidence, but now we have to build on that.\nIf Blackburn\u2019s matches were reset to 0-0 every time one of their players was sent off this season, they would have picked up seven points from three games \u2013 the best 10-man ratio in the entire Premier League.\nMaybe next time Samba goes missing, perhaps he might like to wait until after the kick-off!"}

It asks the courts to reject lawsuits based on patents for vague concepts instead of specific applications because they rack up costs and retard innovation.\nThe amicus curiae brief lets parties outside of a case volunteer information to help a court make a decision. Also cosigned by Zynga, Dell, Intuit, Homeaway, Rackspace, and Red Hat, this brief communicates information to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit regarding the case CLS vs. Alice. CLS claims that Alice\u2019s patents for the vague idea of financial intermediation implemented with a computer shouldn\u2019t be valid. However, the courts initially ruled that Alice\u2019s patents were eligible and could be used to counter-sue CLS for infringement.\nThe companies claim that \u201cabstract patents are a plague in the high tech sector\u201d and that a \u201cdisturbing amount of patents\u201d also fail these tests. Threatened by these lawsuits, innovators have to either gamble on litigation that could force them into huge settlements, or pay steep licensing fees for tech they already developed on their own. These impose a tax on innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers.\nThe last few years we\u2019ve seen companies distracted from their roadmaps, paralyzed by lawsuits, and paying enormous sums for blocks of patents they could counter-sue with to protect themselves from lawsuits surrounding abstract ideas. It seems that the only ones really benefiting from current patent policy are the lawyers. A strong US and world economy relies on the ability for entrepreneurs to come up with specific ways to utilize ideas to generate value. Letting anyone claim ownership of broad ideas locks away this value.\nThe brief follows a big win for patent reformers as the famous \u201cSteve Jobs patent\u201d covering the basics of multi-touch interfaces was invalidated by the US Patent Office on Friday. It\u2019s worth mentioning Apple did not co-sign this amicus brief.\nIt can be hazy as to where exactly \u201cinventiveness\u201d starts and an \u201cabstract idea\u201d stops, but the courts may do well to take the advice of these tech giants a strike down infringement lawsuits based on vague patents as early as possible."}

The strategy worked in Dunbar's favor as the Dayton team won 27-26, after a few minutes of fast-paced play at the end.\nAdministrative assistant to the athletic department Becky Thomas Konz captured, in two different Facebook Live videos, the action - or lack thereof. She said someone estimated they played that way around eight total minutes. An OHSAA regulation varsity quarter is eight minutes and there are two quarters in a half.\nThe game between these two teams came after the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court decided earlier in the day that Dunbar could play Fenwick after the Ohio High School Athletic Association removed Dunbar from the tournament Feb. 28. OHSAA removed the No. 1 seeded team, installing No. 9 seed Thurgood Marshall in their spot, saying the administration failed to properly suspend players involved in a bench clearing brawl at the junior varsity level.\nMore: Dayton basketball team ruled ineligible for OHSAA tournament files injunction.

{"idx": "39130", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: With Chanukah in the past and Purim far off in the future, we now find ourselves in the month of Teves. What special qualities does this month have? In which area can we grow? Let\u2019s begin an analysis of Teves and hopefully learn something which will help us become bigger and better people. Come; we have a way to go.\nThe Sefer Yetzirah writes how every month is auspicious for working on a particular human faculty. Some months have a special focus on Sight, others on Smell or Taste, and yet others on Sleep. The faculty of Teves is Rogez. The reason Rogez has been left untranslated is precisely because it is completely impossible to find an English rendering that would connote all the possible meanings of the word.\nLet\u2019s quote a few pesukim to bring out this point. Firstly, the prophet Chavakuk (3, 2) pleads with Hashem \u201cB\u2019rogez racheim tizkor\u201d, which translates as \u201cRemember to be merciful even during [Your] wrath.\u201d Secondly, in Psalms (4, 5) King David advises \u201cRigzu v\u2019al techeto\u2019u\u201d which roughly means \u201cTremble [before G-d\u2019s Ever-Presence], and thereby avoid sin.\u201d Thirdly, we find Yosef exhorting his brothers (Bereishis 45, 24) \u201cAl tirgizu baderech\u201d which means \u201c[Go straight back to tell Yaakov that I am still alive.] Do not become agitated on the way.\u201d Rashi explains \u2013 \u201cDo not become caught up in discussing a Torah matter [because it will cause you to be delayed.]\u201dThus we see that the word Rogez can connote wrath, trembling, and even fierce discussion over a matter of Torah. This is very confusing. How can all these things be part of one faculty? What do they have in common? And what can we learn from it? We\u2019ve taken a step or two in the right direction. Let\u2019s move on.\nPerhaps we can find a hint by taking a detour to another characteristic of the month. Each month is aligned with a mazel, with Teves matching up with G\u2019di \u2013 also known as Capricorn the Goat. What do we know about goats? Well, one interesting point is that goats are called by a few different names in the Torah \u2013 g\u2019di, se\u2019ir, and eiz. While we will not be discussing the difference between each name, it may be worthwhile to note that the word se\u2019ir not only means a goat but also a demon. What is the connection between goats and demons? Let\u2019s take a look at the prophecy in Yeshayahu (Chapter 13) regarding the destruction and subsequent desolation of Babylon. \u201cBabylonia, the choicest of the kingdoms, will\u2026 be like Sodom and Gomorrah\u2026 It will not be inhabited\u2026 Their houses will be full of ferrets\u2026 and se\u2019irim will dance there.\u201d What are these se\u2019irim (plural of se\u2019ir) that will dance amidst the ruins? The commentators explain \u201cThese se\u2019irim are demons. [But why did the pasuk choose the word se\u2019irim instead of the more common word for demons \u2013 sheidim? The answer is because] the demons will appear in the form in which demons commonly appear \u2013 the form of goats.\u201d Essentially, Yeshayahu is prophesying that the ruins of Babylonia will be"}

Kadowaki, Inc. has applied for a variance from ASME 17.1, 1996 Edition, rule 100.4, Control of Smoke and Hot Gases. The rule requires that hoistways of elevators extending more than two stories shall be vented directly to outside air, and that the area of vents shall be not less than 3.5 percent of the cross-section area of the elevator shaft, with a minimum of three square feet per elevator. J. Kadowaki, Inc. is requesting a variance to allow a 3.14 percent cross-section area of the elevator shaft.\nFor reference, the International Building Code (IBC) 2006, section 3004.1, Hoistway Venting, Exception #1, states that in occupancies other than Groups R-1, R-2, I-1, I-2 and similar occupancies with overnight sleeping quarters, venting of hoistways is not required where the building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with IBC 2006, sections 903.1.1 or 903.3.1.2. J. Kadowaki, Inc. believes it is in compliance with the referenced exemption because there is an existing and approved automatic sprinkler system at Nordstrom, Ala Moana store, which is permitted under IBC 2006 as a Mercantile Group M occupancy that includes department stores, drug stores, markets, motor fuel-dispensing facilities, retail or wholesale stores and sales rooms.\nThe State of Hawaii, Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Division, Boiler and Elevator Inspection Branch agrees that the 3.14 percent of the cross-section area of the elevator shaft as the area of vents will provide a substantially equivalent level of public safety as the building is already equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system that was installed in accordance with IBC 2006 section 903.1.1 or section 903.3.1.2.\nAny party objecting to the granting of the variance must notify the Director at the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations at 830 Punchbowl Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. Written comments must be submitted within 30 calendar days with reasons for not granting a variance and the resultant specific impact to public safety, and/or the need for public hearing, in conformance with section 12-229-16.1, Hawaii Administrative Rules. The reasons for objection may also be based on grounds other than impact to public safety such as feasibility of compliance or lack of undue hardship to the petitioner. The objecting party may also elect to provide the reasons for objection at a hearing."}

This presents both opportunities and challenges for marketers.\nWe recently explored some things to consider to improve your open rates in this climate, but have you ever considered what email users actually say they don\u2019t like about mobile email? Doing so may help you reassess your own strategy.\nAccording to research from The Relevancy Group, 73% of consumers utilize their mobile phone to access one or more email accounts. As time has gone on, it\u2019s only gotten easier to add additional accounts. Google, for example, recently added support for third-party accounts to Gmail, enabling Gmail users to use the app to also check their Yahoo Mail and Microsoft Outlook accounts.\nSo people are opening email from their mobile devices. That\u2019s great news for email marketers. Unfortunately, the mobile experience often leaves a great deal to be desired by the people opening it. This was addressed in a report from The Relevancy Group (via MarketingProfs).\nThe survey asked participants what they specifically don\u2019t like about getting email messages on their mobile phones. 44% of them said they get too many messages. 37% said the marketing messages aren\u2019t relevant to them. 32% said the messages are too small to read and interact with. 26% said when they click-through, the website is illegible on their mobile device.\n\u201cMarketers must focus on frequency, relevancy and real-time capabilities to capture consumer attention and drive engagement,\u201d the report says.\nLet\u2019s think about each of these complaints for a moment. Too many messages. This is a complaint that\u2019s practically as old as email marketing itself, and it\u2019s certainly not limited to mobile. The nature of mobile, however, only amplifies the potential annoyance level. Users are carrying around their devices all day. It\u2019s always with them \u2013 possibly even beside them while they\u2019re in bed. They likely get push notifications, and maybe even receive sounds with these notifications. It\u2019s not hard to see why frequent emails may get annoying, particularly if they\u2019re irrelevant.\nFrequency has always been a difficult balancing act for marketers. On the one hand, you don\u2019t want to drive subscribers away by annoying them, but on the other hand, you need these messages to be seen, and people don\u2019t always open the emails they receive, even if they are relevant. They may not realize a message is relevant without opening it, they may get distracted and forget to open it later, or they may simply just not have the time to concern themselves with the message upon delivery. This is why follow-up emails are sometimes the way to go.\nNeal Taparia co-CEO of Imagine Easy Solutions recently contributed an article to Forbes claiming to have increased overall reach by 54.7%. by sending follow-up emails to those who didn\u2019t open the message the first time. The company increased potential sales by that amount while maintaining a consistent unsubscribe rate. In other words, they didn\u2019t push it too hard. To minimize the annoyance factor, they wait a week to send the second email, and make some minor changes to it.\nSo what about relevancy? According to the report, marketers that leverage existing customer data and pair it with context in a real-time manner have the best shot at increasing accuracy and relevancy of an offer.\nAccording to The Relevancy Group, a countdown timer is one of the easiest and most effective ways to boost real-time email effectiveness.

The treatment is principally responsible for a sufficient reduction in size of the cancer, so that during the subsequent surgical excision, the breast could be then preserved in 48 percent of cases. The medium-term oncological certainty of breast preservation is also shown in this case. Only three percent have a local recurrence after five years, i.e. a tumour found at the same site. Therefore we should not rule out a priori neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cases of lobular breast cancer.\u201d The effect is a marked improvement of the patient\u2019s quality of life. Fitzal says, \u201cThat was and still is our aim. We wanted to achieve this through the combination of the neoadjuvant therapy with the oncoplastic surgical methods, which are provided here in Vienna. We hope that anti-hormonal therapy prior to surgery will bring even further improvements.\u201d The study\u2019s results have now been published in the American specialist publication \u201cAnnals of Surgical Oncology\u201d. Approximately every fifth patient suffers from lobular breast cancer, which is a less aggressive form than the more frequent ductal carcinoma. However, lobular breast cancer generally has more branches and the tumour is generally larger in terms of its diameter. Nodules are only palpable later in cases of lobular breast cancer. The consequence of this particular type of spreading is that the tumour is frequently only discovered when it is already at a locally advanced stage.

That's about equivalent to Ford Motor Co.'s annual net income.\nOur reporting on those traveling one of the longest migration routes in history, from impoverished regions of Africa and Asia through South America to the U.S., suggests this accounting is vastly underestimated.\nThe U.N. estimate is based on 800,000 migrants from all origins crossing the Mexican border.\nBased on our own observation and on our reporting, there are hundreds of South Asians passing through Ecuador and Colombia at any one time. In 2017, El Colombiano newspaper, published in Medellin, cited official estimates of between 4,000 and 11,000 undocumented immigrants passing through the Capurgan\u00e1 region in Colombia per year, saying they were mostly Indian and Nepali.\nThose estimates likely do not include large groups of Punjabi migrants, who, we were told by someone with direct knowledge of the smuggling industry, stay in camps controlled by the paramilitary groups in the mountains above Capurgan\u00e1. That person estimated that the number of people passing through Capurgan\u00e1 is closer to 24,000 a year.\nFrom Nepal and India, for example, our reporting suggests the going rate to the U.S. is around $30,000. Like travel agents, smugglers, known in Nepal as dalals, base their prices on destination and demand. Routes where visas are easily acquired, common migrant laborer destinations like Qatar on the Persian Gulf and Malaysia, cost between $1,000 and $1,500. Journeys to destinations without authorization cost substantially more. To Chile, for example, which is known as the next-best thing to the U.S., dalals charge about $15,000.\nBased on those rates, the number of migrants we count moving through Capurgana each year would represent $720 million in smugglers' revenue. And that's before accounting for the extortionate interest rates \u2014 estimated by the U.N.'s International Labor Organization to be an average of 30 percent in Nepal \u2014 at which that money was borrowed.\nWhile many of the other 776,000 migrants crossing the Mexican border likely pay substantially less than South Asians do, the value of the migrant-smuggling trade is almost certainly in the tens of billions of dollars.\nHow can migrants afford this trip? It's almost impossible for poor Nepalis to access legitimate credit markets. A 2014 report from the U.N. Capital Development Fund found that only about 1 in 10 Nepalis has an outstanding loan \u2014 of any kind \u2014 from a formal bank.\nFor many Nepalis, the $20,000 to $30,000 fee can be had at the drop of a hat. Some borrow from their friends and relatives, but most from a local moneylender, who typically works closely with the dalal. The collateral for these loans is usually the title to the family's land, adding immense pressure to start earning money as soon as possible.\nKidane Okubay and his Eritrean friends traveling to the U.S. told a similar tale.

And that people who have asked questions about its finances have been drummed out of the organization?\nTPP has put a man who owes the IRS more than $500,000 in charge of managing its money as the assistant treasurer?

This shameful episode of Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon must be concluded and the detainees allowed to return to their homes and loved ones.\nThe recent release of a small number of detainees and the parental visits which were conceded by the occupying force are but mere palliatives which have only served to highlight the appalling conditions of their detention and to make our demands for their release even more pressing in view of the first hand reports brought back by the released detainees of the horrific conditions of internment in Al-Khyam and the systematic and barbaric torture practiced behind its walls. Medical reports have corroborated the statements in those reports, as did earlier medical examinations performed on those detainees who had been released earlier, some of whom died in hospital soon after their release.\nThe agreement put forward by Israel, that the so-called South Lebanese Army (SLA) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is, in the final analysis, responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support.\nIn view of the above, the Lebanese Government, the Lebanese detainees, the heirs of the detainees who died in internment and those who disappeared or are still missing or unaccounted for invoke their right to claim damages and indemnities, and to take legal action against the Israeli Government, its military officers and"}

This handy calculator will show you if you're on track.\nPaying for college is an ambitious undertaking, and it's something many parents aren't able to do. But if you're hoping to one day finance an education, you'll need to know whether you're on track. Thankfully, this tool will show you how much to save for college each month to tackle those hefty tuition bills.\nHow much will college cost you?\nWith college costs rising faster than inflation, it can be tricky to establish a savings target if your children are young and college is a decade or more away. But if your kids are already at the point where they're studying for their SATs, then you can use last year's data as a reasonable baseline.\nHow do your savings stack up?\nAs you'll see, this calculator lets you input your children's ages, their anticipated college costs, and the amount you've saved thus far. That data, coupled with assumptions about inflation and returns on your current savings, is used to determine how much you'll need in total, and the amount of monthly savings it'll take, to meet your goals in time.\nKeep in mind that the figures this calculator spits back are just rough estimates. Your child might receive a grant or scholarship, which would lower the amount you'd need to pay yourself. On the flip side, your child might switch majors and prolong college by a semester or two, adding to your costs. But as a starting point, this calculator should give you a decent sense of what it will take to pay for college.\nOpen a 529 plan. Most regular savings accounts these days pay a meager 1% interest. With a 529 plan, you might see a 5% or 6% return even when you consider the fees you'll pay to invest. Furthermore, the money you put into a 529 can grow on a tax-free basis, and as long as you use that money to pay for qualified college expenses, you won't be taxed on your earnings when you take withdrawals.\nSave early on. The more time you give your money to grow, the more you'll be able to take advantage of compounding. If you get a bonus at work, or inherit some money when your kids are young, then stick that cash into a college savings account rather than spending it on something else. Imagine you receive a $10,000 lump sum when your child is 3 years old. If you invest that money right away and manage to generate an average annual 6% return, you'll have $24,000 by the time he or she turns 18 without having to put in another dime. On the other hand, if you invest that money five years later, you'll have just $18,000 by the time your child is ready for college.\nTake the less expensive road to an education. Choosing a public in-state college over a private one can save you a good $23,000 per year on tuition alone. Unless there's a truly compelling reason for your child to attend a private college, you're better off steering him or her toward a more affordable option. Similarly, having your child commute rather than dorm can easily knock $10,000 a year off your total price tag. You can bribe your child with a used car as compensation and still come out ahead.\nSaving for college takes hard work and a ton of effort. The good news? If you save efficiently and encourage your child to make smart choices, there's a good chance those college bills won't be"}

Badran wasn\u2019t elected prime minister of Jordan \u0096 he was simply picked for the post by Jordanian ruler and U.S. ally, King Abdullah II.\nColumnist Jamal Tahat had just graduated from Jordan\u2019s Yarmuk University when students took to the streets to protest a fee increase. He remembers that \u0096 rather than talk to the students \u0096 the president of the university, Adnan Badran called in the Jordanian police and military.\n\"As a result of this decision, students were killed and more than 15 were injured,\" Tahat recalls. \"Many of them still feel the pain in their bodies from that time.\"\nAfter the students\u2019 killing, Badran was removed from his post at Yarmuk University, but he was never charged with any crime and eventually found a job as a high ranking official at the United Nations aid agency UNESCO. Now, he\u2019s been installed as prime minister without an election.\n\"There was not any sort of democratic process producing this guy,\" argues Tahat, adding that Badran\u2019s younger brother was prime minister of Jordan in 1990, when the Kingdom looked favorably on Saddam\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\"To a great extent in Jordan, we don\u2019t have an objective political process for choosing a prime minister, they\u2019re just selected by the king,\" Tahat says.\nBadran\u2019s appointment comes at a time of increased civil unrest in Jordan. King Abdullah\u2019s tacit support of the brutality of the American occupation of Iraq and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands is deeply unpopular. Those who speak out against those policies are repressed. Earlier this year, the 135,000-member Union of Professional Associations \u0096 the largest civil society group in Jordan \u0096 was barred from undertaking any political activities.\nWhen the group protested, the police attacked.\n\"There have been haphazard arrests of union activists; at three or four times, the police closed down the union complex, and all the area surrounding it from one kilometer was closed down,\" relates Dr. Hisham Bustani, a dentist and a leader in the organization. \"Union members were beaten in the streets; some of them were hospitalized.\"\nIn one of the most high-profile cases, the leader of the Jordanian engineers union, Ali Hattar, was accused of \"provocation\" and detained overnight by the authorities in December after he delivered a lecture critical of U.S. military and political involvement in the Middle East. Observers expect the space for protest to get smaller under the new government since the man in charge of the crackdown has been given the ministry charged with political reform.\nMeantime, legislation to permanently prohibit political activity by professional associations has been introduced in the Jordanian Parliament.\nThe law is far-reaching and would create a government-controlled disciplinary structure with the authority to punish and suspend members from the ability to practice their profession if they engage in outside activities.\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch\u2019s Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson calls the move \"a naked attempt to silence the vocal and often critical public debate that the professional associations foster.\"\n\"This law threatens association members with the loss of their livelihood should they dare to criticize the government or hold a meeting without government permission,\" Whitson adds.\nAll of these developments have gone uncriticized by the Bush administration.

What is acceptable and what is not? When can we mention her and when is she off limits? What can we say about her and what can\u2019t we? Frank\u2019s name has been bandied about with some frequency in recent days, in connection with some jarring news stories throughout the world.\nJust this week, the German railway company Deutsche Bahn announced plans to name a new high-speed train after Frank. The decision caused some outcry, in particular over the insensitivity behind linking Frank to a train, the symbol of deportation for millions of Holocaust victims.\nFrank was the center of another controversy over the past week, when she became the symbol of European soccer rivalries. First, a team in Italy plastered stickers on a stadium depicting Frank wearing the rival team\u2019s jersey. The next day, Italy\u2019s sports minister announced that a passage from Frank\u2019s diary would be read aloud at all professional, amateur and youth soccer matches in the country. Then, just a week later, stickers of Anne Frank in a different team\u2019s soccer jersey surfaced in Germany as well.\nThe company quickly pulled the costume and noted that it wasn\u2019t intended for Halloween usage.\nClearly the legacy of Frank is a sensitive one. Using her name or photo for crass commercialization, or sports rivalries, or obviously antisemitic intentions is repulsive and should be condemned.\nBut not all awkward usages of Anne Frank are created equal. While it is clear that now, perhaps more than ever, the world is in dire need of Holocaust education, maybe stories like these can help fuel that need.\nThe discussion we have after these incidents, the thoughtful considerations and the much-needed boost to consciousness and education surrounding the Holocaust should be a positive thing.\nIn 2013, a 19-year old Justin Bieber visited The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.\nSigning the guest book, Bieber wrote that he hoped the young Frank \u201cwould have been a belieber,\u201d a word used to describe his fans. While the pop star was criticized for his seeming insensitivity, few praised the teen for taking time out of his trip to visit a museum about her life \u2013 a museum in which Bieber read about how Frank hung posters of her favorite movie stars on the wall \u2013 much like his fans do today.\nAnd policing Anne Frank improprieties with more Anne Frank may turn out to be ill-advised. After all, when her diary passage was read out at games in Italy last week, it was met by chants and singing by angry fans. Members of the targeted team wore shirts with her face on them, with the phrase \u201cno to antisemitism\u201d written on them. Is a well-intentioned Anne Frank T-shirt not still tacky? While even the best of intentions can go awry, intentions do matter. And attempts to honor \u2013 and much more importantly, remember \u2013 victims of the Holocaust should be lauded. Educational institutions should step in with advice, and countries across Europe should take a hard look at their school curriculums.\nFrank has allowed millions of schoolchildren around the globe to connect to the atroc"}

This article is part of a series of op-eds from key speakers and delegates participating in this year's Social Innovation Summit, which takes place on November 19th and 20th at Stanford Business School.

As depicted in today\u2019s popular movies and books, the future is either one of bright promise\u2014where the world\u2019s greatest problems have been solved by technology and greater human enlightenment\u2014or it\u2019s a dystopian world where today\u2019s problems have only gotten worse, technology has gone bad, and the very survival of humanity is at risk.\nBetter supply of food: Sensors all along the food supply chain, together with Big Data analytics and the intelligence of the cloud, will help us optimize the delivery of food from \u201cfarm to fork.\u201d Sensors in the field will be combined with weather forecasts and other data to trigger irrigation and harvest times for each crop. And sensors on the food itself will alert merchants and consumers about when the \u201csell by\u201d and \u201cuse by\u201d dates are approaching to prevent spoilage. All of this will significantly reduce food waste\u2014which today amounts to about one-third of total world food production.\nBetter supply of water: Similarly, about 30 percent of our water supply is lost due to leaks and waste. Just one faucet or leaky pipe dripping three times a minute will waste more than 100 gallons of water a year. \u201cSmart\u201d pipes can reduce this waste significantly by sensing and pinpointing the location of leaks that would otherwise go undetected for months or years.\nBetter access to education: Affordable access to education is one of the most important ways to lift people out of poverty. Soon, time and distance will no longer limit access to an engaging, affordable, high-quality education. With connection speeds going up, and equipment costs going down, distance learning is going beyond traditional online classes to create widely accessible immersive, interactive, real-time learning experiences.\nBetter access to healthcare: Urbanization and population growth are putting a strain on healthcare resources\u2014especially in rural areas. After the devastating 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, Cisco was a strategic partner in creating a networked medical delivery system, including four telehealth networks that allow doctors to meet with and examine patients remotely. But those capabilities are just the beginning of what IoE will make possible. Soon, women with high-risk pregnancies will be able to wear a tiny, always-on fetal monitoring electronic \u201ctattoo,\u201d which will communicate to the cloud whenever the woman is within range of a wireless network. The analytics capabilities in the cloud will alert doctors at the first sign of trouble, and even tell the mother-to-be when she needs to drink more water, or get more rest.\nWhile sensors and machine-to-machine communication are important parts of these solutions, it\u2019s not just the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d that is making all of this possible\u2014it\u2019s the Internet of Everything\u2014the networked connection of people, process, data, and things.

{"idx": "39178", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: NOVA: How does studying apes sharpen our understanding of the human mind?\nWhy are many researchers looking at how apes and humans imitate actions?\nWell, when you compare humans to other animals, the thing that's most striking is what we humans can build and create as communities\u2014the skills we can pass down from one person to another and from one group to another. If one individual figures out a new skill, and the next individual starts where that first person left off, then you can really speed up the process of building a culture. A lot of things are involved in humans being able to do that, but one little part of it, and one part that we can study in both humans and apes, is the process of imitation.\nHow complicated is it to watch somebody do something clever and pick it up yourself?\nIt's an incredibly complicated skill, with loads of steps, so it's no wonder that very few animals can do it. First, you have to be able to see that what they're doing is goal-directed, that it leads to some goal, such as getting food. And you have to be able to recognize that you share that goal. Then you have to figure out what it is about their movements, maybe their use of a tool, that leads to getting food. How is it physically working? You also have to know enough about your body and other bodies to be able to line them up; when you see the physical motion that another animal is making, a particular way of moving its hands or moving its mouth, you have to know how to do that with your own body. This is called body-to-body mirroring.\nIt's possible that [apes] just lack the initial impetus to deliberately pass on a new skill.\nApes can watch another ape do something\u2014like use a stick to dig for termites\u2014and somehow pick up that skill. Yet it doesn't seem like each generation stands on the shoulders of the previous. Is that right?\nYes. There are many steps to being able to build a skill across generations. The ability to imitate what somebody else is doing is only one part. A whole other problem is the ability to innovate new, exciting solutions to old problems. It might be that what's different between humans and other animals is the quality and complexity and richness of the innovation. Although there's reason to believe that the imitation is different, too.\nIs that, in part, because of the explicit teaching we see in humans?\nRight. And teaching somebody a new trick that you've just discovered is really complicated. It's not exactly clear why it's so much harder than imitation, but it seems to be. One reason may be that you need to work out which parts of what you're doing need to be taught. So what's the difficult bit? How do you show it? How do you slow it down? You need to have enough awareness of what you're doing yourself to slow down the right parts in the right way.\nWhy do you think apes aren't good teachers?\nWell, it's really hard even for human teachers to keep in mind that some task may be difficult when they already know how to do it. For humans, this is called the curse of knowledge. Human teachers struggle with it all the time, figuring out what makes something hard so they know how to help a student. That seems to be a part of what apes don't do very well.\nYou mentioned earlier that a part of teaching is being able to coordinate your attention with another person's attention, and then focusing both on the task you are teaching. I believe psychologists call this \"triadic attention,\" which is a bit of a mouthful. Can you explain more"}

Lake Shore Drive, Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, is kowtowing to the NIMBY instincts of his constituents, who clearly don\u2019t want the world streaming through their high-rent backyard.\nIn the process, Reilly is taking a buzz saw to the city\u2019s master plan for Cityfront Center, whose failed public spaces I documented in Sunday\u2019s column.\nNow the public is getting shortchanged \u2014 again.\nThe Cityfront Center master plan, approved by the City Council in 1985, allowed high-rise residential and commercial building on the 60 acres between Navy Pier and North Michigan Avenue in exchange for developer-financed parks, plazas, and promenades.\nThe goal, according to a 1987 document signed by original Cityfront Center co-developer Charles Gardner and then-Planning Commissioner Elizabeth Hollander, was \u201ca progression of spaces which are intended to unify the entire mixed-use project.\"\nBut many of the spaces \u2014 including a riverwalk esplanade stretching from Michigan Avenue to the planned DuSable Park along Lake Michigan and a secondary esplanade along the Ogden Slip that also would lead to the planned park \u2014 remain unfinished, under-performing, and in one case, closed to the public.\nTo their credit, Related Midwest and its architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, followed the Cityfront Center plan last spring when they proposed a two-tower residential and hotel project for the infamous Spire site, home to an unbuilt 2,000-foot residential tower that went bust in 2008. The developers even pledged $10 million to help build the long-stalled DuSable Park.\nBut in an email to constituents Monday, Reilly announced that the plan \u201cremains stalled\u201d and will stay that way until Related Midwest responds to a list of concerns from neighbors, including this absurd pair: Get rid of the proposed public esplanade along the Ogden Slip and develop a \u201csecurity plan\u201d for the Riverwalk and DuSable Park.\nYou\u2019ve got to be kidding, alderman.\nAs I revealed Sunday, well-heeled neighbors in the CityView Condominiums at 440 and 480 N. McClurg Ct., already have forced the gating of a public promenade, which was approved in the Cityfront Center master plan. Why? Because it inconveniently brought the riff-raff past their private terraces.\nNow, as Sunday\u2019s column anticipated, people who live near CityView Condominiums want to shut down another promised chunk of public space.\nThe suggested \u201csecurity plan\u201d is equally ridiculous.\nISIS surely doesn\u2019t have the Riverfront Esplanade and DuSable Park on its hit list. But maybe that\u2019s not who the neighbors are worried about.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration makes a point of stressing that it\u2019s learned from the mistakes of Cityfront Center and that it\u2019s ensuring that riverfront public spaces remain open to public.\nThe high-rise, mixed-use project at the Tribune"}

The company said Dec. 14, 2018, that 2,700 out of the 3,300 factory jobs it has slated for elimination will now be saved by adding jobs at other U.S. factories.\nGeneral Motors' plans to lay off 14,000 salaried and blue-collar workers might not be as bad as originally projected.\nThe company said Friday that 2,700 out of the 3,300 factory jobs slated for elimination will now be saved. Blue-collar workers will still lose jobs at four U.S. plants slated for closure next year, but most will be able to find employment at eight other GM factories where jobs are being added. Some would have to relocate.\nGM still plans to lay off about 8,000 white-collar workers and another 2,600 factory workers in Canada.\nIn November, the company announced plans to end production at the U.S. factories and one in Ontario as part of a major restructuring designed to cut costs and divert resources to development and manufacturing of trucks, SUVs and electric and autonomous vehicles.\nLegislators and President Donald Trump have hammered GM over the factory closures and layoffs.\nWhile some of the roughly 3,300 factory workers will retire, most of the rest will be offered one of 2,700 jobs the company plans to add at factories where production will increase, GM announced on Friday. Some would have to uproot and move to other cities for jobs.\n\"Our focus remains on providing interested employees options to transition including job opportunities at other GM plants,\" CEO Mary Barra said in a statement of the factory workers.\nThat still leaves the majority of the 14,000 cuts hitting white-collar workers. A small number of them will be able to transfer to other openings, and those who can't will get help in finding work elsewhere, the company said.\nSince the announcement, GM has faced withering criticism from Trump, legislators from the affected states and the United Auto Workers union, largely over the plant closure plans. Trump has focused on a plant in Lordstown, Ohio that's slated to stop making compact cars on March 1. He has promised to return factory jobs to the U.S. and Ohio, a key state in his 2020 re-election campaign.\nGM's attempt to close the factories still has to be negotiated with the United Auto Workers union, which has promised to fight back. The other factories that could go are assembly plants in Detroit and Oshawa, Ontario, and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and near Baltimore.\nTrump continued to blast GM and Barra in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. \"I don't like what she did,\" Trump said. \"It was nasty. Ohio is going to replace those jobs in two minutes.\"\nThe announcement that nearly all the blue-collar workers may get other GM jobs could counter some of the attacks, but it's unlikely to stop them completely since GM still intends to halt production at the factories. It's also unclear how many workers would be willing to relocate.\nTommy Wolikow, 36, who was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, factory in January of 2017, said he would be interested in openings at a Toledo, Ohio, transmission factory and an assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. But he's not happy about the prospect of having to move. \"I want to go"}

No matter what, the departure date has been scheduled for March 29 next year \u2014 meaning that negotiators have about six months to conclude negotiations on aspects such as the movement of people and goods across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nTechnical details aside, the politics of Brexit are also not helping.

Inspired by the concept of the $100 laptop for the developing world, called a 'children's computer,' sneered at for its teeny keyboard and bare minimum features, it was the wedge that has changed the computer market of today, creating an entirely new category\u2014the netbook\u2014 and influencing pricing and form factor for personal computers for every market, rich or poor, in less than 3 years.\nThere's evidence that the shift of consumers away from more expensive products is a widespread trend. In the consumer electronics industry, for example, McKinsey research found that 60 percent of consumers were more interested in a core set of product features at a reasonable price than in the bells and whistles of the latest and greatest technology at a higher price. Similarly, in the building-products industry, there is a trend away from premium-priced design features and toward simpler, more basic designs. Understanding this challenging shift in consumer behaviour is necessary for companies to compete successfully. It represents an opportunity for those that respond quickly and effectively to differentiate themselves from their peers.\nThis finding has been echoed by the likes of HJ Heinz' CEO, The Huffington Report and even consumer research in Germany. Perhaps its time we took a closer look at a few more examples of such \"underperforming\" products designed and developed specifically for the less profitable consumer, along with their supporting ecosystem innovations in business models, distributions and pricing.

Rather than source servers through a traditional vendor like IBM (s ibm) for its data centers, Facebook turned to Quanta.\nBack then, Quanta didn\u2019t sell servers directly to customers, it only built them for traditional server vendors who then put their name on them and sold them to customers. Fast forward a few years, and a majority of Quanta\u2019s server revenue stems from direct deals \u2014 65 percent in 2012, and a forecasted 85 percent this year. Now, it counts other large-scale server buyers such as Rackspace among its customers.\nYang, the man in charge of Quanta\u2019s cloud computing business unit, beamed during an interview on Thursday as he spoke about how the company can directly offer energy-efficient and high-performance products for webscale customers and smaller ones, too. If the Taiwan-based hardware maker\u2019s 85 percent forecast proves out, the company could become a more recognized supplier for cloud computing venues, further threatening old-line server vendors like Hewlett-Packard (s hpq) and Dell (s dell).\nThe company, with U.S. headquarters in Fremont, Calif., didn\u2019t show projections of server revenues in dollars or server shipments in total but said it shipped 1.2 million server motherboards in 2012 and plans to ship at least 10 percent more \u2014 1.32 million motherboards \u2014 this year.\nQuanta appears to be on a roll with Quanta-brand direct server sales growth. At the same time as it\u2019s doing custom jobs for webscale customers, it\u2019s also promoting direct sales of other gear, including off-the-shelf storage and network appliances, to smaller customers through a subsidiary Quanta established last year, Quanta QCT.\nThe company has a few strategies in mind for shifting from an original-design manufacturer to a name brand in its own right, at least in servers. It sees full racks of equipment, under the Rackgo name, as a major seller this year. The Rackgo offering, which includes compute, storage and network appliances, can appeal to customers because there\u2019s simply one company to go to when problems arise, Yang said.\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the Open Compute Project \u2014 the Facebook-led open-source hardware initiative that kicked off Quanta\u2019s evolution as a direct server vendor. Quanta will come out with multiple products based on Open Compute specifications later this year, although exact timelines weren\u2019t immediately available.\nNext month, the company will open an office in Seattle in order to be closer to customers. Yang said Quanta has several customers in the area, although he declined to name them. Microsoft, (s msft) which is building huge data center capacity for Windows Azure and its Live offerings, is a short drive from Seattle, in Redmond, Wash., and Seattle is much closer to Quincy, Wash., a hotbed of data centers, than the Fremont office. Quanta will add more U.S. offices for sales and service this year, Yang said.\nQuanta is also opening up to the press, rather than silently working behind the scenes. That campaign started last year.\nThe company\u2019s business model has undergone a sea change. If the upward trajectory keeps up and the server-market dynamics keep shifting in its favor, Quanta could become one of the stalwart name brands of IT technology."}

What they didn't know was that they would shortly find themselves in an advisory role as well. In addition to their regular responsibilities as members of the Squadron staff, seven Officers and NCOs also serve on the Task Force-Southeast (TF-SE) Police Advisory Team (PAT). Although the task was unexpected, Soldiers embraced the challenge with the willing spirit and creative problem-solving skills of true Cavalrymen. \"I didn't know I was going to be a part of the PAT until we were on the ground\" explained MAJ Daniel Bell, Squadron Operations Officer. \"Presented with the opportunity, I was very happy to be part of an advisory role, as it gives me the opportunity to assist Afghan capabilities.\"\nAlthough the other members of the PAT share MAJ Bell's can-do attitude, the task is not without its challenges. As 1LT James Pesola stated, \"To put it in perspective, it took over 100 years to professionalize and legitimize police in the United States; we have been trying to do this in Afghanistan in less than two decades now.\" 1LT Pesola serves as both the Squadron Assistant Operations Officer and a member of the PAT. Like his colleagues, he had no formal training as an advisor prior to deployment, but brings a wealth of abilities as a leader in the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team's premier reconnaissance organization. \"Despite the fact that I'm not a Scout Platoon Leader anymore, being an advisor can carry a lot of the same parallels. You have to think about the people of Afghanistan the way you care about your Soldiers, because in the end what you are doing is making the lives of all the Afghan people better.\"\nThe mission to advise and improve the Afghan National Police (ANP) is a vital component of the overall strategy for Afghan success. With a presence on the streets, the ANP can serve as a bridge uniting citizens with government and military efforts to create security and stability. \"These people are still fighting a war, have rough living conditions, and there is a separation from larger populations and smaller villages. Economically they are trying to sustain families and livelihood. Once you can get security you can help foster additional programs that can be pushed to local communities. Police are the key to the security in this country. Without that, the Army will never be successful. The Police and the Afghan Army are tied together just like we are tied together in the United States,\" stated one of the PAT civilian advisors.\n2-1 Soldiers serving as PAT advisors stress the necessity of constant and consistent contact with their ANP counterparts. A normal day for the team involves multiple phone calls to maintain relationships with a high frequency of touch points. The team plans advising missions for face-to-face contact at least twice a week to reinforce trust and familiarity, including trips to more remote locations to establish new contacts. \"We try to plan new places we haven't seen before to build new relationships\" said 1LT Pesola.

That's a win for the industry. The deal, if enacted, would not be nearly as disruptive as what President Donald Trump has long threatened. Trump had said he wanted to get rid of NAFTA, which he claimed had cost thousands of auto jobs.\nTrump promised that a new deal would bring those auto jobs back home to the United States. But experts are skeptical about how many jobs will return if the agreement becomes law.\n\"The supply chain is not being substantially impacted,\" said Miro Copic, business professor at San Diego State. \"It gives the manufacturers the flexibility they wanted.\"\nInvestors in US automakers are already showing signs of relief. GM (GM) stock was up almost 5% Monday, and Ford (F) climbed more than 3%.\nThe new rules outline a couple of major changes that would affect auto companies.\nThe agreement says at least 40% to 45% of the car must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to avoid tariffs when the vehicles are moved across the US-Mexico border.\nIt also requires that 75% of a car's parts must come from North America to avoid tariffs. That's about 12 percentage points higher than the current threshold.\nExperts say the wage provision could tip the balance when automakers are deciding whether to build a plant in the United States or Mexico, but its effectiveness may also depend on how it is enforced.\nMatthew Rooney, director of economic growth at the George W. Bush Institute, sees it as a potential \"enforcement nightmare.\"\n\"[It] leaves a lot of discretion to customs officers, and could be very difficult to manage,\" Rooney added.\nOthers say the changes might not matter much, because many of the cars being assembled in Mexico already comply with the new rules. That may have been one of the reasons the Trump administration was able to reach a deal.\n\"I don't anticipate there will be any major dent in the Mexican economy as a result of this deal,\" said Chris Garcia, CEO of Vicar Financial, and a former high ranking official at the Commerce Department under Trump.\nExecutives in the auto industry were huddling on conference calls Monday trying to sort out the details. But they've also been lobbying the Trump administration since its inception to make sure any rules were not as draconian as Trump's original promises.\n\"This deal is the result of a very concise and targeted advocacy effort to make sure the administration understood the implications of driving too hard a bargain,\" Garcia said.\nInstead, the real losers could be parts plants in Asia or even Europe, because the agreement would require that more car parts must come from North America to avoid tariffs.\n\"I would think it won't mean any closing of the plants here [in Mexico],\" said Gaston Pereira, CEO of the digital finance firm QPagos, based in Mexico City. \"In fact the requirement for [more] regional content could mean more investment in Mexican plants.\"\nStill, automakers will have to look closely at their supply chains should the deal go through.\nIf changing things up would cost more than the tariff on foreign autos, which is around 2.5%, companies may decide to just take the hit and import their cars as foreign vehicles."}

They\u2019ve just never really gotten a fair shake. Well, they\u2019re about to get another chance at being done right. The Hollywood Reporter says that the Canadian production company Copperheart Entertainment is bringing Anne McCaffery\u2019s sci-fi/fantasy series \u201cThe Dragonriders of Pern\u201d to the screen.\nThe series first kicked off in 1968 with the novel \u201cDragonflight\u201d and has since spanned dozens of books and time periods. This isn\u2019t some cheap Lord of the Rings knockoff, but a rich and unique world based more in science than fantasy. The books tell the story of a distant planet called \u201cPern\u201d colonized by humans so long ago that they\u2019ve forgotten their Earth-based history. In order to survive, their forefathers developed genetically engineered dragons to help cope with their paradise planet\u2019s one flaw: a deadly rain of an acidic substance called \u201cThread\u201d, which burns and disintegrates anything it touches. Lucky for the people of Pern, Thread can be destroyed in mid-air by fire, making those dragons pretty handy.\nThere\u2019s no word on which book in McCaffrey\u2019s series is being developed, by far the best of the lot is Dragonsdawn, a prequel which tells the story of the original colonists\u2019 first settlement and their struggle to survive against the planet\u2019s unexpected rain of life-ending \u201cThread\u201d. But it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll start with one of her other books like \u201cDragonflight\u201d, which happens hundreds of years after that first landing, long after the colonists\u2019 descendents have forgotten their origins and slipped into an age of feudal kingdoms and technological darkness.\nAs you can tell, I\u2019m something of a fan. \u201cDragonsdawn\u201d sits happily on my shelf alongside the works of Herbert, Heinlein, and Tolkien, Some of the other \u201cDragonriders\u201d books aren\u2019t quite up to the quality of McCaffrey\u2019s prequel saga, but the basic concept is a good one: humans riding and bonding telepathically with dragons to form a sort of necessary symbiosis. The thought of seeing squadrons of human ridden dragons diving through the sky in pursuit of a tangled mass of death gives me chills. If done right, this could be one hell of a film experience. Or done wrong it could be Reign of Fire. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the former, but Copperheart isn\u2019t exactly a major production company and this is a film that needs a massive budget.\nTo date, the only thing Copperheart has done of note is a 2005 Oscar winning animated short called Ryan. Does that mean \u201cDragonriders\u201d will be animated? Let\u2019s hope not. It\u2019s actually already been done once as a cartoon.

They spent their customary four-month retreat, chaturmasya (July to October), meditating and praying in Tirupati.\nKalavai, their chosen retreat while their case is being decided, is a village about 120 km from Chennai.

It draws a trickle of visitors, no more than 20 a day, compared to the hundreds who once thronged the fortress-like Kamakoti Mutt in the temple town of Kanchi.\nA few small, low hutments are set amidst neem trees and in the largest room, both swamijis sustain their habitual long daily pujas to Shiva as Sri Chandramouliswara, presiding deity of Kanchipuram, with only a handful of attendants \u2014 and uniformed security guards at the gate.\nThe junior swami maintains moun vrat though he smiles cordially at visitors, while the senior swami is willing to talk to those who ask the historical resonance of this retreat.

U.S. arms sales to the island are a major bugbear for Beijing.\nThe election outcome would be a relief to China. The opposition DPP\u2019s independence-leaning stance has long angered Beijing, even though Tsai had tried to distance herself from that position in the campaign. Analysts had said a DPP win would have put ties with China in limbo, and sharpened Beijing\u2019s differences with the United States.\nMa\u2019s victory lifted a potential cloud over China\u2019s own leadership transition later this year.

Birdies at the 13th and 16th, plus a brilliant eagle at the par five 15th (where he holed from the greenside bunker), and a bogey at the 14th meant he signed for a one-under-par 70.\nIt was a timely return to form for Evans, who missed the cut in 10 of his previous 13 tournaments, during which time his best finish was tied 44th at the Made in Denmark event a fortnight previously.\nThe 70,830 Euros that Evans won moved him up from 143rd to 117th on the season-long Race to Dubai rankings.

Even after a swoon through June wiped out a hot start. Even after his club found itself floundering in early July.\nAnd when the Pirates responded with a 15-4 surge that seemed to validate his optimism, he sent a message at the non-waiver trade deadline. The Pirates are intent on winning. Not just in 2018, but beyond.\nPittsburgh acquired starting pitcher Chris Archer from Tampa Bay and closer Keone Kela from the Texas Rangers in moves that cost the team top prospects in outfielder Austin Meadows and pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Taylor Hearn as well as two players to be named.\nThe decision to deal three players considered a part of the club\u2019s next wave wasn\u2019t easy. But Huntington believed it was necessary to bolster a group that has a chance to reach the playoffs.\nThe Pirates entered Tuesday night\u2019s game against the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs 3\u00a2 games out of the second wild-card spot thanks to a torrid stretch that began July 8.\n\u201cGiven the quality of the core, the players we have and those who are still on the horizon, the ability to add two players such as this, we feel, pushed us into a higher level and allows us to believe we are going to be one of those teams that has a legitimate chance to make the postseason not only this year (but beyond),\u201d Huntington said.\nArcher, a two-time All-Star, is 3-5 with a 4.31 ERA in 17 starts this season for the Rays. The 29-year-old adds experience to a Pirates rotation that includes three starters \u2014 Jameson Taillon, Trevor Williams and Joe Musgrove \u2014 26 or younger.\nNeither move is a rental for Pittsburgh, which was the only team to not sign a major-league free agent last winter despite parting with cornerstones Cole and McCutchen in January.\nThe 25-year-old Kela has 24 saves and a 3.44 ERA. He will be arbitration-eligible beginning next season and will not be eligible for free agency until after the 2021 season.\nPittsburgh will assume the remaining $2,049,731 in Archer\u2019s $6.25 million salary. He also receives a $500,000 assignment bonus for the trade. His deal includes a $7.5 million salary for 2019, a $9 million team option for 2020 with a $1.75 million buyout and an $11 million club option for 2021 with a $250,000 buyout.\n\u201cTo get Keone with two-plus years of potential contribution and who knows behind that, to get Chris Archer with three years plus this year where he\u2019s going to impact our wins, those were really good gets in our mind,\u201d Huntington said.\nMeadows, a first-round pick in the 2013 draft, hit .292 with five home runs and 13 RBIs in 49 for the Pirates after making his major league debut on May 17.

Bolton\u2019s appointment, rushed out late Thursday, follows Trump\u2019s recent attempt to recruit Fox guest Joseph diGenova for his legal team.\nAnother recent TV-land addition to the Trump White House is veteran CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow as top economic adviser. Other Fox faces on Trump\u2019s team: rising State Department star Heather Nauert, a former Fox News anchor; communications adviser Mercedes Schlapp and Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh. The latter two are both former Fox commentators.\nTrump\u2019s affinity for Fox News is by now well-documented. He has bestowed more interviews on the network than any other news outlet and is an avid viewer. People close to the president say he thinks Fox provides the best coverage of his untraditional presidency. It also provides him a window into conservative thinking, with commentary from Republican lawmakers and right-wing thinkers \u2014 many of who are speaking directly to the audience in the Oval Office.\nZucker spoke at the Financial Times Future of News conference two days after a former Fox military analyst quit, claiming he was ashamed at the way the network\u2019s opinion hosts were backing Trump. Zucker said that analyst, Ralph Peters, voiced what a lot of people have been thinking about Fox in the post-Roger Ailes era.\nStill, in Trump\u2019s Washington, lawmakers and influence-seekers know that the best way to get in Trump\u2019s ear is often to get on Fox. Legislators routinely seek to get airtime when they are trying to push legislation or policy ideas, said congressional aides who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private thinking.\n\u201cA year ago, everyone was trying to figure out how to get into the building; now everyone is trying to figure out how to get on TV,\u201d said Republican consultant Alex Conant.\nThis past week, for example, conservative lawmakers unhappy with the spending bill moving through Congress took to Fox. \u201cThis may be the worst bill I have seen in my time in Congress,\u201d said Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Wednesday.\nThe hosts quickly pushed back. \u201cTell him to let the teachers carry concealed,\u201d said one.\nWhile the coverage varies by show, \u201cFox and Friends\u201d tends to be Trump-friendly, with the chipper morning show spotlighting his achievements and bashing the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d On Friday, they featured a teen from the Florida high school where the shooting occurred who opposes gun control efforts, as well as a young conservative activist who interviewed Trump at a White House event the day before.\n\u201cThe irony is not lost on me that you have a lot of quote \u2018TV stars\u2019 calling Larry Kudlow and John Bolton \u2018TV stars,\u2019\u201d Conway said."}

His book, The Practical Nomad: How to Travel Around the World, is now in its fifth edition. To write it, he traveled 80,000 miles and visited 28 countries on six continents.\nWhile photos of Hasbrouck on the Net depict a bearded, jovial man who could very easily slip into the moniker \"happy nomad,\" the last 12 years have added a darker edge to his portfolio of traveler services. Let\u2019s just call him \"TSA watchdog,\" and thanks to the constant expansion of that agency\u2019s passenger screening, data collection, and secret intelligence sharing, Hasbrouck is now working full-time at poking, pricking, prodding and challenging the agency so you don\u2019t have to.\n\"This is essentially about rights,\" he told Antiwar.com in a recent interview. \"This is the government claiming that you have no \u2018right\u2019 to travel and that travel is a privilege that they can grant or withhold on a whim, and impose whatever they like on it.\" That of course, is an anathema to a man who spent his entire adulthood globetrotting. Early on, he focused his writing and researching on helping consumers get the cheapest airline tickets and to be astute and safe travelers. But a couple of years before 9/11, he noticed red flags going up regarding passenger privacy and the kind of personal data the government was canvassing and collecting in massive databases in the name of \"security.\"\n\"I became concerned about the consumer privacy issue, with the data privacy practices, and the practices of handling personal information, and I wrote about it,\" he said.

The California-based Hasbrouck, who is well known and respected in the travel industry as an enthusiastic, prolific writer and advocate, as well as a straight shooter, poured all of his energy into dogging the government in its new activities. Someone needed to parse the often-Orwellian government language about the new screening and security rules, and he felt not only compelled, but qualified to do it on behalf of the traveling public.\nTSA was created in 2001, and the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, while the Patriot Act was spurring massive database projects like the Computer Assisted Passenger Screening System (CAPPS and CAPPS II). In CAPPS, air travelers\u2019 names were to be checked against a huge data pool fed by numerous public and commercial (including criminal) records, as well as any terrorist watch lists available. Passengers would then be issued a color-coded marking on their tickets to determine how they would be vetted upon arrival at airport security checkpoints.\nHasbrouck was the first to report that Jet Blue airlines had without notice or permission, given over 5 million passenger itineraries to the Pentagon, with the help of the TSA, for a study that supposedly tested whether CAPPS or CAPPS-like programs would be feasible. This started the first of many reports of airlines just \"handing over\" passenger data to third party contractors, ostensibly to help build the CAPPS database.\nCAPPS II was shut down due to complaints"}

Fortunately, Old Firm fans who maintain \u201cYou\u2019re nothing without us\u201d \u2013 and that the rump SPL would be akin to the League of Ireland or Welsh Premier \u2013 are just kidding themselves.\nCeltic and Rangers obviously bring a huge audience to advertisers; if they disappeared from Scotland there would certainly be a critical drop in commercial income, television revenue and sponsorship money. On the other hand, the league would immediately become more competitive and more sides could have a realistic crack at the title, then the qualifying rounds of the Champions League.\nThe major clubs from Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh would still be around, while teams like Kilmarnock, Motherwell, Falkirk and St Mirren already draw average gates of over 5,000 even when faced with a dispiriting struggle for mid-table safety. Attendances could actually go up without the stultifying effect of the domineering duo who have finished in league positions one and two for 13 of the last 14 seasons.\nTaking the crowds into account, SPL-lite would be more akin to the lower reaches of the Championship crossed with elements of League One, rather than the more poorly supported set-ups in Ireland or Wales. That may not be brilliant for national self-esteem but it is realistic for a country of five million where most interest revolves around Celtic Park or Ibrox. Until someone devises a post-Old Firm rate sheet for pitch side advertising or comes along with a reduced offer for the media rights then the league\u2019s viability is just speculation \u2013 although a few interesting questions remain.\nOld Firm fans have a touching naivety about their prospects elsewhere \u2013 as if healthy attendances in Glasgow, allied to increased TV money, would inevitably lead to them to become masters of the universe in a scant few seasons.

Walker makes a complex subject readable and accessible to older children. In Written in Bone: Buried Lives of Jamestown and Colonial Maryland, she details the painstaking steps of forensic anthropology investigations \u2014 for example, it took two whole years for scientists to develop a plan to approach colonial lead caskets that had been unearthed beneath what remained of a Catholic church because they were so rare \u2014 and reveals exactly how and why these scientists do their work and what they learn.\nWalker shadows the investigations of several sets of colonial era remains, which based upon the investigative work profiled in the book, are likely to be a colonial teenager, an English captain, a poor soul likely to be an abused indentured servant, a well-to-do Maryland family found in lead caskets, and those buried in what was likely an early colonial African American cemetery (they may have been slaves, indentured servants or free colonists). Vivid close up photographs accompany detailed writing that shows exactly how scientists come the conclusions they do, from assessing bone conditions and fractures (for example, have any fractures healed at all or do they look \"fresh,\" meaning they were new or recent at time of death?) to soil conditions and placement of the remains. Historical documents, along with cutting-edge science that reveals about how long English colonists might have lived in North America and consumed a corn-based diet, combine to reveal a comprehensive look at early English colonists\u2019 culture, lifestyle and more.\nWalker\u2019s book is never sensational; it\u2019s clear that everyone working on these projects holds the utmost respect for those people whose lives they are investigating. Walker\u2019s interviews with the forensic anthropologists working on these projects round out the historical and the reporting aspects of the narrative. There are numerous physical, scientific, and historical challenges to be addressed, and the rewards are great, giving voice to people who might have had none in life and learning more about how early colonists lived their daily lives. An extensive bibliography and list of sources and websites for more information round out the book nicely, giving readers many places to go to continue their reading on the subject if they want to.\nMiddle and high school students with any kind of interest in forensics, American history or anthropology are likely to find Written in Bone an utterly fascinating read.\nI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you.

She doesn't have fair skin, which is one of the most important factors for Chinese beauty.

This is a rare opportunity to see this classic on the big screen\u2014and in the proper aspect ratio, so the top and bottom of the film are not cut off. It\u2019s hard to imagine that there\u2019s anyone out there who has never seen the film\u2014though I\u2019ve actually heard from one person who claims not to have\u2014but having merely seen the movie on TV isn\u2019t really the same as having seen it as it was meant to be seen. This is, after all, a picture about a giant ape (or ape-like creature) and dinosaurs\u2014things that need to be significantly more than a few inches high.\nToday we consider King Kong one of the great classic horror movies from the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the horror film, but that\u2019s not exactly what it is\u2014and it certainly isn\u2019t how filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Shoedsack saw the film. The duo met at the end of WWI and found they both had a taste for adventure and the more remote parts of the world. They parlayed this into a couple of ground-breaking documentaries, Grass (1925) and, more importantly, Chang (1927). These were different than the normal documentary in that the pair invented dramas that would be played out by the people they were documenting. In that sense, these were more docu-dramas than documentaries. Chang, in fact, contains both the genesis for several scenes in Kong (substitute elephants for a giant ape), and the inspiration for the story of Kong\u2014an adventure experienced by a documentary filmmaker and his crew.\nThat was the point: King Kong was an adventure story unlike anything anyone had ever seen. It\u2019s one that became possible thanks to the creativity of special-effects pioneer Willis O\u2019Brien, who was added to the team in the early 1930s as the film developed. Somewhere along the way it morphed into something more than a fantastic adventure, becoming a modernized Beauty-and-the-Beast fairy tale. Like all good fairy tales, it contained elements of horror, but it was never intended to be a horror movie in the normal sense. Perhaps the fact that\u2014like such memorable creatures as the Frankenstein monster\u2014Kong was ultimately a sympathetic character helped blur the line, moving it over time into the horror realm. In any genre, it\u2019s still a classic.\nOn the unlikely chance that anyone doesn\u2019t know, King Kong is the story of documentary filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), who\u2014taking the advice of critics and exhibitors\u2014has decided to incorporate a girl into the film he intends to make about a mysterious uncharted island in the South Seas. When no theatrical agent can\u2014or will\u2014provide him with an actress, he finds a girl, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), who\u2019s a victim of the Depression and perfectly willing to throw her lot in with him. What they find when they reach that island is beyond even Denham\u2019s wildest dreams. Rather than bringing back a movie, they return with Kong himself and put him on display in a Broadway theater, which doesn\u2019t turn out well for anyone."}

The satire doesn't work. Was it wrong to run? Of course. But some critics went overboard, acting like it was 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., with Bull Connor ordering police dogs on black demonstrators.\nLuckily, the Post came to its senses Friday and apologized - \"to some\" as the headlines read - for an obviously offensive cartoon.\nHere's a description for folks who didn't see it: Two cops, one with a smoking gun, stand over the bullet-riddled body of a chimpanzee. The cop without the guns says, \"They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.\"\nAnyone with an average understanding of U.S. history knows the monkey image has been used to depict black men. Although the cartoonist denied the image represented President Obama, it's easy to understand why many readers came to this conclusion since a couple days before, police in Connecticut shot a pet chimpanzee that attacked a woman.\nThe cartoonist and the editor who approved it for publication messed up. I'm not sure I'd call it racist, though. The word is used too cavalierly.\nBut so-called civil rights activist Al Sharpton had other thoughts. He put on his boxing gloves and lead a demonstration in which protesters chanted \"End racism now!'

Once all has been said and done and the relationship is over, do you remain friends?\nWe\u2019ve seen it explored in a couple of movies, where the partner who\u2019s leaving tries to soften the blow of the break-up by encouraging both parties to go down the friendship road. But let\u2019s be honest. In that particular moment, the last thing you want to do is be amicable with someone who has hurt you.\nSo, stepping into the real world, is being just friends with an ex-lover actually possible? Some may argue that it is not. If you stay in the relationship for too long and it becomes so toxic that you can\u2019t recover, then it may result in you being too bitter. And there\u2019s no way of salvaging any camaraderie in that light.\nOn the flip side, if there are many unanswered questions and you both become a little too close for comfort, you may resort to becoming \u2018friends with benefits\u2019, and that will be sure to muddy the water.\nHere\u2019s a reality check: It\u2019s not practical to move from one point to the other. Your adjustment time can take longer than others\u2019. It depends on the emotional upheaval leading up to the split. Don\u2019t expect a smooth transition to happen overnight. Pace yourself. Get your mental health in check before you make any sudden movements back down a familiar street.\nSo how do you shift from ex to friend? Admitting culpability is the number-one way of speeding up that process significantly. Healing, letting go, and realising that it just wasn\u2019t meant to be is another. Once you\u2019ve crossed that threshold, then you can embark on a new path to friendship.\nWhat happens when your ex moves on and you\u2019re still a special friend in his or her life? Now that\u2019s a tricky one. There\u2019s no real answer for that. Couples have opted to lie all together by omitting the fact that this specific friend is, in fact, an ex. Opening up that portal and sharing that kind of background information can be intimidating to a new love.\nThere\u2019s also the option of being completely transparent with your new significant other, confessing that even though that relationship is over, your ex stills plays a vital role in your life. And it can become beneficial to the new union, because the other half can gather intel. Some new partners actually grow to form friendships with those exes and even place the ex\u2019s name on the wedding guest list.\nMany people find that they make better friends than partners. You tend to appreciate people more in retrospect; once you take out all the emotions, you can focus on the good. And you\u2019re also able to just tell it like it is because of the history you share. A relationship that evolves from romance to another chance, as friends, can become much deeper and long-lasting.\nSo, after a break-up, just breeze out for a bit and see where life takes you. But don\u2019t knock staying friends until you\u2019ve tried it."}

{"idx": "39262", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In a recent study, almost 25 percent of first-year students reported they study less than 10 hours per week outside of class, with only 12 percent saying they spend more than 25 hours on school work.\nThe posting below provides provides some suggestions on how to get your students to spend more time studying. While the examples are from engineering much of what is said applies across the board. The article is by By Phillip Wankat and Frank Oreovicz from the September, 2003 issues of ASEE Prism, Volume 13, Number 1. . Copyright ? 2003 ASEE, all rights reserved. Reprinted with permission.\nThere's no getting around it. Learning requires a certain amount of time, but many students would rather be checking their e-mail or chatting with friends than hitting the books.\nThe problem is that engineering is a particularly rigorous course of study, requiring more discipline than many young people have. We believe engineering colleges should increase the hours of structured in-class time for first- and second-year students. More courses should involve extensive recitations with students doing cooperative group problem solving. A supplemental instruction course coupled with a core course is another alternative. This method centers on group problem-solving sessions run by instructors who have nothing to do with assigning grades in the core courses. By increasing student effort and providing opportunities for students to be successful, supplemental instruction courses can help students learn the material and improve their grades in core courses by one to two levels.\nWe must also expect students to study more outside of class. This can sometimes be accomplished by assigning students tasks they actually enjoy, such as computer simulations to solve realistic problems, or by giving them \"what if\" questions. We've found, for example, that most students enjoy Web searches. Another way to encourage students to study more is by assigning group projects and letting the participants pick the topic. A combination of studying alone and in groups seems to work best. Group work motivates students to focus on the task at hand. And based on our experience, there is less need for special tutoring and extra office hours when groups tackle the homework. To make this work, though, you may need to be creative-disguising homework as \"extra credit\" or having a debate between teams to spark interest and effort.\nInvolving students is a surefire way for them to learn. Cooperative group learning, computer simulations, guided design and problem-based learning are methods we've used successfully. Keep in mind that students need to stay involved with tests and assignments even after the work has been turned in. Students must understand and use the feedback to correct or improve their results. You can encourage them to revise their work by offering extra credit.\nThe majority of engineering students are intelligent enough to succeed in college. Motivation is what often separates one student from another. Although we would rather that students be motivated internally, external motivators have to sometimes be used. Personal attention, particularly from teachers, can be a strong external motivator. You can do this by using students' names, knowing something about them, and showing interest in their professional progress. Co-op or internship work sessions, service learning, undergraduate research, and tutoring others are good ways to keep students focused. By working together with other faculty members, you can ensure that lessons on how-to-learn are reinforced from one semester to the next. Improving student learning does not require further research and study. All of the necessary pieces have been studied and piloted-the challenge is to put these pieces together into a coherent program."}

That will have prompted raised eyebrows among the other clubs competing at the top end of the table, not least because the transfer window had already been extended by two days to clear last weekend, with all parties pointing towards adverse weather conditions in London having prolonged completion.\nThe delay actually maintained the theme after protracted negotiations between the clubs that had dragged throughout January before one final flurry of hectic discussions and brinkmanship on the final day of the window. Indeed, there were real concerns that Arshavin could be denied a transfer from the club with whom he has been associated for 20 years even on Monday. Zenit had demanded Arshavin pay back a significant proportion of the \"loyalty bonus\" he was paid upon signing a four-year contract at the Russian club in 2006, a sum that had been awarded on the understanding that the player would complete his contract, with compromise eventually reached last night.\nZenit claimed that they would receive \u00a315m from Arsenal, and around \u00a31.5m from Arshavin as a part repayment of the bonus monies. A further payment of \u20ac500,000 that had been due to the player in bonuses will not be met, with the Russian club building that money into their valuation of the deal at \u00a316.9m. Arsenal have not disclosed the fee paid, but it has undoubtedly eclipsed the previous record transfer, the \u00a313m paid to Bordeaux for Sylvain Wiltord in August 2000.\nThe signing will come as a welcome boost for Arsenal's squad. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side may be unbeaten in 10 league games but they trail fourth placed Aston Villa by five points and are 10 from Manchester United at the summit. The Frechman's decision to target Arshavin represents a break from his normal policy of buying promising younger players, as well as paying out a large sum in the mid-season window. But the reality of losing Tomas Rosicky to a hamstring tendon injury \u2013 the Czech has been absent for a year and has only just returned to very light training \u2013 Cesc Fabregas to knee ligament damage and Theo Walcott to a dislocated shoulder has severely damaged Wenger's options.\nThe new arrival has been taking English lessons for two years, with the prospect of working with Wenger convincing him to force through a move to Arsenal. \"I like Arsenal's style, I like Arsene Wenger as a coach, and I like some players in this team,\" Arshavin told Arsenal TV online.\nArshavin, who had travelled to London on Sunday evening in the hope that the deal would be completed, will now return to Russia to complete the formalities of applying for a work permit.

Scott Pidcock, architect for the project, said the proposal presented at Thursday's workshop session, is a \"planning study to address the space requirements of the township staff for the next 15-20 years and includes a considerable amount of projection.\"\nThe G. Edwin Pidcock Co. was commissioned to make the study about three weeks ago.\nUnder the proposal, 7,500 square feet would be added to the municipal building in the form of additions to the east and west sides of the existing structure, said Gerry Gasda, director of community development in the township. About 6,100 square feet, mostly office space on the north side of the building, would be renovated.\nWork on the public works building, located to the rear of the township building, would include an 8,600-square-foot addition and renovation of 2,340 square feet of existing space.\nFeatures of the west addition to the municipal building include a new public meeting room with \"roughly the same capacity of the existing room,\" according to Pidcock, a small conference room for 20 people, restrooms and an elevator.\nThe current meeting room would be converted to office space and a computer center.\nThe lower level would house township records currently stored in the old township building at Guthsville. The Guthsville facility will probably be sold, Gasda said.\nThe upper level of the east addition would house the community development and tax collector's offices, with the lower level used for police offices and locker rooms.\nThe west wing plan, Pidcock said, allows the rest of the township building to be secured during public meetings. That option is not currently available.\nAdditions to the public works building also follow the east-west expansion pattern with \"modest offices for sewer and water supervisors, shower facilities and a storage area\" in the west and some truck storage and a small parts storage area to the east, Pidcock said.\nParking spaces, lost by expansion of the municipal building, would be recouped by adding 50 spaces in the area of the public works building. Those would be allocated for the staff.\n\"The proposal,\" Pidcock said, \"could be undertaken in bits and pieces at any time. The commissioners are considering a variety of scopes.\"\nTownship Manager Chester Gilkey said funding for the project would be made through bond issues over not less than 20 years to be handled by the township authority. The township, he said, \"has a non-electorial borrowing base of $7 million. The authority has an unlimited borrowing base.\"\nCosts for preparing the plans and following them through the bidding stages would cost $80,000-$100,000, he said.\nIf the plans are approved, construction could begin Aug. 15, 1985, with completion projected for Aug. 15, 1986.\nThe commissioners are expected to decide if they want construction documents and bid costs drawn up at their Feb. 18 workshop meeting, Gasda said. The plans, he added, will be placed in the meeting room for public scrutiny."}

Among those agencies is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which uses the IDs to verify passengers boarding commercial flights.\nBy now, most Minnesotans know there\u2019s something up with their driver\u2019s license.\nFor months, state officials and legislators have been debating how to comply with the so-called Real ID Act, a federal mandate that all state-issued driver\u2019s licenses must have extra security measures and proof of citizenship. If states don\u2019t have these new enhanced IDs, it could complicate citizens\u2019 abilities to do everything from board an airplane to enter a federal or military building.\nBut the details get fuzzy after that. When is Minnesota required to comply? How much will it cost? Can Minnesotans get on a plane?\nThere\u2019s a very clear reason Minnesotans don\u2019t know much about what\u2019s going on: In 2009, legislators passed a law barring state officials from even talking about the act with the federal government. Now, facing a few looming deadlines, legislators are scrambling to undo their previous actions and find a way to comply with Real ID.\nWhat exactly is the Real ID act?\nIn the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the federal government turned its attention to the security of driver\u2019s licenses, the preferred form of identification used for travel. In 2005, Congress passed the Real ID Act, which required minimum security standards for state-issued licenses.\nThe enhanced IDs don\u2019t look very different than current Minnesota licenses, save for a few new federally approved markings. But what\u2019s required to get one of the new IDs is different: it must be backed by verified proof of birth, residence, Social Security numbers and lawful citizenship status. The new licenses also carry a high-tech electronic radio frequency identification chip.\nMore important: As part of the Real ID Act, certain federal agencies were prohibited from accepting any identification that does not meet those standards. Among those agencies is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which uses the IDs to verify passengers boarding commercial flights.\nWait, that was a decade ago. Why are we talking about this now?\nAfter postponing full implementation over the course of several years, the federal government went state-by-state to get each ID to comply with the act or get an extension \u2014 though not in Minnesota.\nIn 2009, state legislators passed a law that prohibited the commissioner of public safety from \u201ctaking any action to implement or to plan for the implementation\u201d of the Real ID Act. The bill passed with near-unanimous support in the Minnesota Legislature and was signed by former Gov.

Most states that had yet to comply got a substantial extension from the federal government, but again, not Minnesota. Why? The 2009 law.\nDoes that mean Minnesotans won\u2019t be able board airplanes with their current driver\u2019s license?\nNo, not yet. First, the federal government promised to give officials a 120-day warning before they would start enforcing the act.

Thinking about Malaba for now is too much for the plate,\" Mr Macharia said in an interview with the Nation.\nMr Macharia is currently in China to conclude negotiations for funding of the Naivasha to Kisumu SGR sector.\nKenya secured a Sh150 billion loan from China to extend its railway from Nairobi to Naivasha and construction is ongoing. The Mombasa -- Nairobi SGR line was completed mid-last year.\nUganda Finance Minister Matia Kasaija told Daily Nation's sister publication, the Daily Monitor, on Monday, that the Uganda government had put on hold the SGR venture and has instead turned attention to revamping the old metre-gauge railway network.\nThe Chinese-financed project is the first stage in a scheme that aims to extend to Uganda and other landlocked countries.\nThe goal is to cut the cost of transport and boost trade by replacing a slower, narrow-gauge line.\nFor some time now, Ugandan government officials have blamed Kenya for failing to commit themselves to financing the remaining two -- Naivasha-Kisumu, and Kisumu-Malaba sections.\nKenya's non-commitment, according to sources, is mainly debt concerns, but also the fact that there is little economic activity in Uganda to justify such an investment.\n\"It is apparent the SGR is going to take us a lot of time to complete. First, we have to wait for Kenya to reach at the Malaba [border] point then we can start,\" Mr Kasaija told the Daily Monitor Monday.\nMr Kasaija was quoted saying the Uganda government, in the interim, is refurbishing the old railway line as \"an alternative\" to lower transportation costs for traders.\nUganda's first phase of SGR, the eastern line running from Malaba to Kampala, is about 273km and is expected to cost about Sh234 billion.\nMr Kasaija said that Uganda has currently taken a back seat on the SGR venture, but will resume \"serious discussions once Kenya is about to reach\" the Ugandan side.\nHe said that during the discussions in Beijing, it was agreed that \"Uganda and Kenya will embark on joint financing negotiations\" after Kenya has completed the current Nairobi-Naivasha section."}
{"idx": "39280", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The totalitarian left should be upset because \u201cExpelled\u201d is a wry, funny, well-crafted documentary. The juxtaposition of popular music, dramatic vignettes, documentary footage and Ben Stein\u2019s quest for truth is often laugh-out-loud funny. At the same time, it is heart-rending, convincing and transformational. Like any documentary, of course, there are a few moments when the tension relaxes, but most of the movie, especially the last third, is captivating because Ben Stein takes on atheists and Darwinian evolutionists like Richard Dawkins and exposes the fact that they are logically challenged.\nBen Stein starts out talking about the fact that the United States was built on freedom. He quotes the Founding Fathers and juxtaposes the freedom of the United States with the Communist Berlin Wall in Germany.\nCarefully, Stein makes the case that the academic community has become as oppressive of freedom as that same community oppressed freedom in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He interviews professor Richard Sternberg, who lost his long-term job at the Smithsonian Institute because he dared to publish a peer-reviewed article with two or three references to intelligent design. The article did not endorse intelligent design, but the very mention of intelligent design brings severe repression from the pseudo-scientific academic community. He then talks to Dr. Caroline Crocker, who lost her professorship at George Mason for having one reference to ID.\nOne by one, Stein introduces us to prestigious scientists at major universities who were expelled because they dared to mention intelligent design and open up the academic discussion to non-Darwinian viewpoints. He moves from there to questioning the institutions and the administrators who expelled these academics. The administrators squirm under his interrogation but eventually admit that the academic community has no room for freedom and honest intellectual inquiry.\nThen, he visits France and Germany and shows the Darwinian roots of fascism, taking the audience through the famous mental institution of Germany where hundreds of infirm and mentally ill people were cruelly murdered. What is more frightening is his guide who says she cannot judge the doctor, who headed the institution that disposed of the infirm and the outcasts, and she seems to side with the Darwinian fascists. Ben even takes on Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood and the other proponents of eugenics who wanted to rid the world of the races that they thought were inferior.\nStein interviews scientists who say their Darwinian education converted them from Christianity to atheism. Several of them note that death is the end, there is no free will, life has no meaning, and none of them can explain the origin of life.\nFinally, the famous self-promoter Prof. Richard Dawkins, when cornered in an interview, says life may have originated from aliens seeding the planet. Of course, everyone watching \u201cExpelled\u201d realizes that the teleological argument should lead Dawkins to ask where did that alien life originate.\n\u201cExpelled\u201d then takes us to discussion of the complex life of the cell. The Dawkins interview at the end exposes an incredibly villainous attack on the good, the true and the beautiful while at the same time showing that the smug Dawkins has no idea what he\u2019s saying and is unable to answer even the most basic questions!\nAs noted, this movie has leaked out into the atheist community and created a vicious outcry. Rather than expelling the movie, the professors and freedom of thought, it is clear that the successors of Darwinism, Hitler\u2019s National Socialism and Communism would like to torture anyone who dares question, as real scientists"}
{"idx": "39281", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Linux founder Linus Torvalds makes no bones about it. He thinks inserting signed binaries into the Linux kernel is \"moronic.\"\nIt started innocently enough. Red Hat software engineer David Howells asked Linus Torvalds, Linux's founder, to move on code that would let Microsoft-signed binary keys be added dynamically to a kernel while running in secure-boot mode on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML). Torvalds wasn't having it. \"Quite frankly, this is f*cking moronic.\"\nLinux Torvalds and Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, \"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\"\nSpecifically, Howells was asking \"to embed an X.509 certificate containing the key in a section called '.keylist' in an EFI PE [Extensible Firmware Interface Portable Executable] binary and then get the binary signed by Microsoft.\" Howell was asking for this so that Linux users can add keys with new Linux software in Windows 8 PCs' UEFI Secure Boot prisons. These keys would be needed to help properly boot Linux that needed to use proprietary, binary-only drivers such as some graphic chipsets from AMD and Nvidia.\nLike it or lump it, the easiest ways to get Linux installing or running on Windows 8 PCs with Secure Boot all involve using Microsoft signed UEFI keys . Matthew Garrett, a Linux UEFI expert and creator of the shim boot method used by Red Hat, pointed out that these keys are only available from Microsoft as PE binaries.\nAs anyone who follows Linux closely knows, Linux developers have no love for programs that have no source code and are only available as binaries. It goes against the very grain of open-source software. While most Linux users and programmers will grudgingly use such binaries as proprietary graphic and Wi-Fi drivers, the closer a binary comes to the Linux core, to the kernel itself, the less they like it.\nThus, it shouldn't have come as no surprise when Torvalds blew up.\nIf you want to parse PE binaries, go right ahead.\nIf Red Hat wants to deep-throat Microsoft, that's *your* issue. That has nothing what-so-ever to do with the kernel I maintain. It's trivial for you guys to have a signing machine that parses the PE binary, verifies the signatures, and signs the resulting keys with your own key. You already wrote the code, for chissake, it's in that f*cking pull request.\nGarret responded, \"Vendors want to ship keys that have been signed by a trusted party. Right now the only one that fits the bill is Microsoft, because apparently the only thing vendors love more than shi**y firmware is following Microsoft specs. The equivalent isn't just Red Hat (or anyone else) programmatically re-signing those keys, it's re-signing those keys with a key that's trusted by the upstream kernel. Would you be willing to carry a default trusted key if some sucker/upstanding and trustworthy member of society hosted a re-signing service? Or should we just assume that anyone who wants to ship external modules is a f*cking idiot and deserves to be miserable?\"\nTorvalds fired back, \"Quite frankly, I doubt that anybody will ever care, plus getting me to care about some vendor that ships external binary-only modules is going to be hard as hell.\"\nGarrett replied that he can't see Red Hat getting into the key signing business.

And Ambastha was quick to capitalise on it. She teamed up with her husband Manasij Ganguli and his colleagues Abhishek Srivastava and Bratish Goswami to found Threadsol in March 2012.\nThe startup provides enterprise material management technology to enable manufacturers buy just the right amount of fabric and use that fabric with minimum wastage. \u201cOur product has managed to cut down wastage to less than 1%. This translates into savings of up to 10%\u2014millions of dollars for manufacturers,\u201d says 38-year-old Ambastha, Co-founder and COO. Initially, the uniqueness of Threadsol\u2019s solution, says Ambastha, also made it difficult to pitch the solution to clients.\nIt took some time to explain the viability of their product and how it could help companies save money and improve operational efficiency. \u201cAt first, many apparel manufacturers were skeptical about our product, but once we explained how it functioned, they were willing to try us. We may have received a delayed response, but we never faced rejections,\u201d says Ambastha. Now the company, which operates out of Bengaluru and Delhi, has a presence in 15 countries.\nIt\u2019s more than 85-strong client list includes manufacturers of Zara, Adidas, Nike, Levi\u2019s, Victoria\u2019s Secret, JC Penny and Walmart products. Indian client list has Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail (formerly Pantaloons), Blackberry\u2019s and Raymond, among others.

Popular social network.\nThe move to oust Mark Zuckerberg will almost certainly fail in the strongest signal yet that companies with uneven share voting structures should attract a discount to their valuation.\nAn attempt is being made to remove Mark Zuckerberg as chairman that is almost certain to fail because unless Zuckerberg votes for the motion himself, it will fail. This is because of the dual voting structure where the A shoulders hold 82% of the economic interest in the company but only 32% of the voting power. The B shares which make up 18% of the economic interest in the company control 68% of the vote.\nMark Zuckerberg owns over 75% of the B shares meaning that he alone controls at least 51% of all votes cast. Consequently, any motion that he does not like will fail as the majority of shares will be cast against the motion. The reality is that Mark Zuckerberg has complete control over Facebook, the election of its directors, the makeup of its board, its strategic direction and any major M&A that is entered into.\nI have said many times that while things are going well and the shares are going up, no one cares but when things begin to go wrong, they will go wrong for longer than if management can be removed by minority shareholders (see here, here, and here). This is exactly what is going on with Facebook and the current crisis that it now faces. When problems arise, founders tend to be more emotionally attached to losing strategies than professional managers. Because no one can force them out or to change, they tend to stick with these losers for far longer than they should.\nThe result is that problems tend to be far worse and last much longer than they otherwise would if the shareholders had the power to enact change. Consequently, A shareholders are stuck with Zuckerberg until he himself decides to go and there is nothing that they can do about it.\nWhen RFM looks at a company, it takes this into account by applying up to a 30% discount to the fair value of the shares depending on the degree to which smaller shareholders are being disadvantaged. Companies like Google, Facebook and Baidu get the full 30% discount. If the company is still attractive after that discount, then RFM is happy to own it knowing that investors are being properly compensated for being unfairly treated. With margins to fall another 500bp this year, weak AI and a general slowdown, Facebook is not close to being attractive even before the 30% discount has been applied.\nHolding the shares for the rest of this year is likely to result in the piper having to be paid in heavy coin.\nRichard Windsor is the owner and operator of independent research company Radio Free Mobile.

But not to Oliver Stone.\nLeaving the glamor of Hollywood far behind, Stone arrived in the steamy Colombian city of Villavicencio on Saturday as part of a mission led by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to retrieve three hostages held for years by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.\n\"I have no illusions about the FARC, but it looks like they are a peasant army fighting for a decent living,\" Stone said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press at his hotel bar. \"And here, if you fight, you fight to win.\"\nStone is part of an international delegation expected to fly by helicopter as early as Sunday into the country's eastern jungles, an area the size of France, to collect the captives: former congresswoman Consuelo Gonzalez, Clara Rojas and her young son Emmanuel, who was fathered by one of her guerrilla captors.\nWhen asked if he's concerned the heavily armed guerrillas could turn on him, he joked: \"Well, if they took us, they would be swapping three hostages for 10,\" referring to himself and observers from six Latin America countries, France and Switzerland, along to supervise the release. \"If I were them, that would make sense.\n\"But seriously, no, I'm not worried. The FARC knows there would be universal condemnation if they did that,\" said Stone, whose arrival has ramped up the media circus that already surrounds the pending handover.\nMore than 150 journalists have camped out in Villavicencio's airport since Thursday, waiting for the rescue operation to begin.\nThe mission seemed unlikely to be completed Sunday as originally promised by Venezuela, as rescuers were still awaiting word from the rebels on the exact location of the release. Meanwhile a rocket narrowly missed an air force cargo plane as it was landing in southern Colombia, underscoring the difficulties involved in crossing live battle lines.\nThe famous director's presence in this violent country, struggling through its fifth decade of civil conflict, is a worry to his Colombian and Venezuelan guides. They prohibited him from leaving his hotel in Villavicencio, a town rocked in recent years by turf battles between rival drug traffickers and far-right death squads.\nChavez personally invited Stone to join the rescue delegation after the pair, who say they are mutual admirers, met for the first time earlier this week in Caracas.\nDispatching rescue helicopters from Venezuela on Friday, Chavez joked that Stone was President Bush's emissary to the operation, while Stone called Chavez \"a great man.\"\nThe hostage release could improve prospects for hundreds of other rebel-held captives, Stone said, including three U.S. defense contractors whose four-year confinement he said he has closely followed.\n\"This release could be a new start, a break in the ice \ufffd and the release has been well-propelled forward by Chavez,\" said Stone. \"The important thing is that we build momentum so everyone can be released.\"\nThe mission also gives Stone a chance to get the lay of Colombia's political landscape for two upcoming movies.\nFootage from the liberation will form part of a documentary on \"North America, and that includes our relations with South America and people like Ch"}

The researchers were able to use lasers to temporarily inactivate a specific neuronal population, reversing alcohol-seeking behavior and even reducing the physical symptoms of withdrawal.\n\"This discovery is exciting--it means we have another piece of the puzzle to explain the neural mechanism driving alcohol consumption,\" says Olivier George, PhD, an associate professor at Scripps Research and senior author of the new study, published March 18, 2019 in the journal Nature Communications.\nAlthough the laser treatment is far from ready for human use, George believes identifying these neurons opens the door to developing drug therapies or even gene therapies for alcohol addiction.\n\"We need compounds that are specific to this neuronal circuitry,\" George says.\nAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, more than 15.1 million adults in the United States suffer from alcohol use disorder. Previous work at Scripps Research has shown that transitioning from casual drinking to dependent drinking occurs alongside fundamental changes in how the brain sends signals. These signals drive the intense cravings that make it so difficult for many people to scale back their alcohol consumption.\nGeorge and his colleagues have been hunting for the brain cells that driving drinking in an alcohol-addicted rat model. In 2016, they reported that they had found a possible source: a neuronal \"ensemble,\" or group of connected cells in a brain region called the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). This finding marked major progress in mapping the brain, but the researchers needed to characterize the identity of the neurons in this ensemble.\nFor the new study, they tested the role of a subset of neurons in the ensemble, called corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons. The George laboratory had found that these CRF neurons make up 80 percent of the ensemble. Were these neurons the masterminds driving alcohol cravings?\nThe researchers studied these neurons using optogenetics, a technique that involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue. Rats used in this study were surgically implanted with optic fibers aimed to shine light on the CRF neurons--to inactivate them at the flip of a switch.\nFirst, the scientists established a baseline for how much the rats would drink before they got addicted to alcohol. The rats drank little this point--the equivalent of a glass of wine or one beer for a human.

{"idx": "39314", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Risk of Rain 2 surprise launched in early access last week. The game is a followup to Hopoo Games\u2019 2013 Risk of Rain, a 2D roguelike platformer. Though it makes some changes to the original formula, Risk of Rain 2 is less a sequel and more the original game remade in 3D. This is great.\nAs in the first game, you choose from a handful of characters with different sets of abilities. The first available character, the Commando, has a dodge roll and a variety of ammo types. Other characters, who can be found in the world or unlocked by completing certain tasks, can freeze enemies, lay down turrets, teleport, or wield swords. Most of a character\u2019s abilities are on cooldowns. You have to manage them carefully to take on the hordes of monsters that spawn as you spend more time in a level, as the game\u2019s difficulty increases over time. Each level has a teleporter you need to find to progress; activating the teleporter spawns a boss. Later levels felt like a moshpit of floating fireballs, laser-shooting giants, and deadly flying jellyfish.\nRisk of Rain translates well to 3D, for the most part. Pixelated monsters that were kind of adorable in the 2D version are terrifying when their hulking forms materialize beside you in 3D. Items you find attach to your character, and it\u2019s fun to see yourself studded with ukuleles, spectral knife arms, and floating guns. The worlds themselves have more presence than they did in 2D. An ice level feels barren and vast; a fire level, covered in jagged floating islands and bridge-sized chains, is oppressive and threatening.\nThe level layouts aren\u2019t as visually distinct from each other as they were in 2D. Layouts feel repetitive, with little variation from run to run. The landscape itself can be difficult to parse, especially when you\u2019re looking for the teleporter, a flat circle with two claw-like pillars rising out of it. It was easy to spot in 2D once you came across it but can be maddening to find in 3D. In a few games, I realized I had passed and missed the teleporter multiple times because it blended into the landscape. Since the game\u2019s difficulty increases over time, 10 minutes spent backtracking has a high penalty that can make things frustrating. The developer says it\u2019s working on making the teleporter easier to see, so things that frustrate me during early access may change.\nRisk of Rain 2 has new characters, items, and a rare persistent currency called Lunar Coins, which unlock special items and a character. The teleporter also functions differently. Now, it won\u2019t fully charge and let you leave the level unless you\u2019re within a certain radius. This design choice encouraged me to fight bosses where they spawned instead of applying my tactic in the first game of leading them to more strategic spots on the map, which made boss fights feel a little more dynamic. Overall, though, Risk of Rain 2 felt to me like more or less the same game with a new look.\nI have no problem with this. Risk of Rain is one of my favorite games to be terrible at, and it\u2019s just as fun to try and fail in 3D as it is in 2D. I spent the weekend hopping between Risk of Rain 2 on my PC and Risk of Rain on my Switch, equally delighted and frustrated by both. I\u2019ve yet to check out multiplayer"}

Learn more about AMSCO Windows.\nIf the eyes are the windows to the soul, as they say, the windows to your home likewise have a lot to say about your house and about your style.\nSo when you face the task of choosing the right windows for your home, it may seem a little daunting. Of course, cost may be the first thing you think about when looking at options, but there are other things you should take into consideration when selecting what will likely be a long-term component of your home.\nHere are just three essentials to keep in mind as you shop.\nWith vehicles, buildings and appliances, a top concern is their use of energy. Are your cars guzzlers or sippers? Is your home green or a relic of days gone by when climate change wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar?\nWindows make a big difference in your home\u2019s energy efficiency \u2014 with heat gain and loss through them \u201cresponsible for 25 to 30 percent of residential heating and cooling energy use,\u201d according to the Department of Energy. So keep in mind important related features whether you\u2019re hoping to be a good steward of the environment or are just looking to save money on gas and electric bills.\nEnergy.gov has some tips on what to look for when you\u2019re shopping for windows, such as looking for the Energy Star and NFRC labels and choosing gas-filled windows with Low-E coatings to reduce heat loss.\nMost people likely have had to struggle with opening or closing a window or keeping it propped open, or they\u2019ve wondered how in the world they were going to clean the other side of their windows. So ease of use is a vital consideration when buying.\nThey\u2019re easy to clean because you can tilt the sash and reach various areas of the window.\nWindows make a statement about your aesthetic. So take the time to think about what the choice you make will say about you. Is your home contemporary or more traditional? Colonial or Mediterranean? Do you want the rich and classic look of wood, or is the practicality of vinyl a good fit all-around?\nThough the tried-and-true options have generally stayed the same (wood, aluminum and vinyl, for instance), they have seen some updates. The Renaissance Series option from AMSCO, for example, is a composite material that can withstand harsh conditions and is durable and resistant to moisture and mold. But it has the elegant look of wood that can be easily stained or painted to match the interior of your home.\nEven vinyl windows are seeing some upgrades. In the past, they have been a standard style and their color limited to white. But it\u2019s now possible to choose from a variety of styles and a number of colors, as in AMSCO\u2019s Studio Series.\nOnce you\u2019ve weighed these and other considerations and you\u2019re ready to buy, visit a dealer that features AMSCO windows."}

Stalkers, who are individuals that try to get close to a person, are a real threat to famous people. The stalker becomes fixated on the famous person and is often delusional, thinking that he and the person have a relationship.

James Kennedy ministries is suing the Southern Poverty Law Center for designating it as an official \"Hate Group\" for its biblically-based opposition to homosexuality and transgenderism.\nAll of these are the result of three things: de-Christianization of Europe and America, the rise of radical secularism, and the Islamization of Europe. The three things are not separate but intimately interwoven. The secularization of Europe and America is the cause of their de-Christianization, and the vacuum of faith and moral culture caused by secularization is being filled with a great inrush of Islam. We might add that it is the disunity of Christians that also made all of this possible by making Christianity weaker and more easily supplanted both by secularism and Islam.\nWhat might be surprising about all of this is that it all began over a half-millennium ago. As I show in my The Reformation 500 Years Later: 12 Things You Need To Know, both secular atheism and Islam were there at the time of Martin Luther, atheism just beginning to blossom and Islam ready to take over Europe.\nWhy is that important to know now? Because all Christians today, Catholic and Protestant, face this common threat from increasingly militant secularism and Islam.\nSecularism is the source of the eugenics and euthanasia movement that, like killer-nurse Niels Hoegel, believes that true compassion means the extermination of the unfit and suffering, just as we would any animal. This \"compassion\" represents a complete rejection of the moral arguments of Christianity.\nThe centuries-long secular drive to eliminate Christianity from culture has been very successful, leaving us with empty churches. These empty churches represent the hollowing out of our previously Christian-defined culture, and hence the nearly complete victory of secularism, which continues to be pushed ever harder by the liberal cultural elite. The Left's hatred of Christianity that fuels its efforts at de-Christianization understands that Christianity is the enemy that (however weakly) stands in the way of its complete cultural victory.\nThis anti-Christian hatred very much defines the far Left, Marxist-based groups like Antifa, who (with no apparent irony) use hatred and violence to snuff out groups whom they accuse of hatred and violence, and a prime target are those Christians who oppose anything of the secular Leftist agenda.\nChristians \"hate\" because they have drawn moral lines which the Left has long ago crossed and hence crossed out, and that's why the Southern Poverty Law Center designated a Protestant ministry as a hate group.\nFinally, the Left, from its beginning in the rise of modern atheism in the century before Luther,"}

{"idx": "39333", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Since the start of 2019, it seems we can\u2019t go a day without seeing the words vegan or plant-based popping up somewhere within our public discourse. From Carl\u2019s Jr. showing off their new meat-free burger during the Super Bowl, to the latest scientific study pointing to animal agriculture as one of our planet\u2019s greatest threats, vegan rhetoric now spans far and wide. And with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker just announcing his presidential bid came yet another round of news stories zeroing in on the booming plant-based trend (he ditched animal products in 2014).\nSo what\u2019s with all this sudden love for animal-free eating? Well actually, it\u2019s not that sudden, and it\u2019s not just about food. Veganism is a way of life that seeks to exclude the use of animals in food, clothing, cosmetics, entertainment, etc., as far as is practical and possible, and has been quietly growing in popularity for the last several years. Between 2012 and 2017, global sales of plant-based meat substitutes rose an average of 9.3% each year, tripling that of processed meat sales, according to Euromonitor. In 2018, Google reported a remarkable spike in \u201cvegan\u201d as a search term compared to 10 years prior, and the vegan Beyond Sausage was named one of Time Magazine\u2019s best inventions of the year. And so far in 2019, more people appear to have participated in Veganuary \u2014 a bid to go vegan for the month of January \u2014 than ever before.\nIn May, Booker posted to Facebook his affinity for \u201cthe delicious simplicity of a whole-food, plant-based diet,\u201d suggesting health may be a driving factor in his five-year plant-based journey (it is for Serena Williams). Perhaps that's because animal product consumption has been linked to increasing risks of heart disease, diabetes, obesity and certain cancers. In fact, The American Dietetic Association deems a well-planned vegan diet as \u201chealthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases,\u201d and \u201cis appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle.\" Even the Canadian government published a revised national Food Guide last month, removing dairy as a food group and shifting focus toward plant proteins.\nFor Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, the move to plant-based eating appears to be more environmentally motivated; they are partnering with the Greenprint Project, a group that promotes the positive impact of a plant-based diet on the environment, for their ticket giveaway. Indeed, as study after study continue to reveal, animal agriculture is considered one of the leading global contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, ocean degradation, fresh water pollution and loss of wildlife and biodiversity. One study in particular, published in the journal Nature last fall, made headlines worldwide claiming that western countries must reduce beef and pork consumption by 90% and chicken and dairy by 60%, replaced with four to six times more beans and pulses, in order to help thwart potential climate breakdown by 2030. Another high profile study published just last month in British medical journal The Lancet then stated that North Americans must reduce red meat consumption by 84% in order to help feed our booming population and rescue the planet by 2050.\nSince an 80-90% reduction in beef equals out to about one small serving or less per week, why not just ditch it all together?

But in a paper to be delivered at a weekend conference, Brescoll said such studies focused on men.\n\u201cAs Senator Clinton\u2019s experience suggests, however, for a professional woman anger expression may lead to a decrease rather than an increase in her status,\u201d Brescoll wrote.\nShe conducted three tests in which men and women recruited randomly watched videos of a job interview and were asked to rate the applicant\u2019s status and assign them a salary.\nIn the first, the scripts were identical except where the candidate described feeling either angry or sad about losing an account due to a colleague\u2019s late arrival at a meeting.\nParticipants conferred the most status on the man who said he was angry, the second most on the woman who said she was sad, slightly less on the man who said he was sad, and least of all by a sizable margin on the woman who said she was angry.\nThe average salary assigned to the angry man was almost $38,000 compared to about $23,500 for the angry woman and in the region of $30,000 for the other two candidates.\nIn a second experiment, the script was similar except that the job applicant also described his or her current occupation as a trainee or a senior executive.\nThat impacted salaries. Unemotional women were assigned on average $55,384 compared to $32,902 for the angry ones. Male executive candidates were assigned more than trainees, regardless of anger, with an average $73,643.\nA third experiment tested whether a good reason for anger made any difference. The script was changed so that some angry candidates explained that the co-worker who arrived late had lied beforehand, indicating he had directions to the meeting.\nSure enough, the angry woman with a good reason to be angry was awarded a much higher salary than the angry woman who provided no excuse, though it was still less than the men.\nBad bosses get promoted, not punished?\nThe study, to be presented this weekend at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management, a research and teaching organization with nearly 17,000 members, found similar attitudes to anger among male and female participants.\nBrescoll said the findings revealed a \u201cdifficult paradox\u201d for professional women \u2014 while anger can serve as a powerful tool to achieve status at work, women may have to behave calmly in order to be seen as rational."}

I was pleased to see they painted the interior of the Maelstrom and while adding the sound deadening material to the door panels may not be needed, it is welcomed with open arms.

In terms of the normal season points, that will determine the top 6 who compete the showdown; Haslam has a 64-point advantage over second placed Bradley Ray aboard the Buildbase Suzuki who failed to score at Snetterton after crashing in both races. His race two crash took out Be Wiser Ducati Rider Glenn Irwin, who felt he could have gone on to win the race had the youngster not intervened.\nThe crashes at Snetterton were Ray\u2019s first DNFs of the season. The wild-haired, bespectacled Ray has not only caught the eye domestically; his form in BSB has resulted in a call up into the Yoshimura Suzuki team for the Suzuka eight-hour race alongside 2014 World Superbike champion Sylvain Guintoli, Takuya Tsuda and Kazuki Watanabe.\nBefore he can think about Suzuka, Ray will be concentrating on getting his season back on track at Knockhill where last year he ended a run of three consecutive DNFs with a 12th place in race two.\nLast year the Scottish round was dominated by Jake Dixon, who won both races - his only victories of the year. Haslam missed the trip north of the border due to injuries sustained in the crash at Oulton Park earlier that season.\nEventual 2017 champion Shane Byrne claimed two third places at Knockhill, but the six-times champion\u2019s future is still in the balance; he will be absent due to serious injuries sustained in a crash during testing at Snetterton and it will be several months before he knows whether he can race again.\nDespite missing the Snetterton round Byrne remains in third place in the championship, only three points behind Ray. Andrew Irwin, the younger brother of Byrne\u2019s team-mate at Be Wiser Ducati who was drafted in as replacement, scored his first points of the season with 10th place in race two at Snetterton.\nWith two podiums, third in race one and second in race two, RAF Regular and Reserves Kawasaki rider Jake Dixon elevated himself to fourth in the championship and is now only 10 points behind Ray, with 12-point cushion over fifth-placed Glenn Irwin.\nJosh Brookes elevated himself into the top six on the back of his best weekend of results in 2018 so far. The McAms Yamaha rider claimed a season-best fourth in race one and went one better in race two, finishing on the podium.\nSo far this season there have been only three race winners; Haslam with six, Ray two and Byrne one, although 10 riders have finished on the podium, with all the competing manufacturers represented. Honda, Yamaha and BMW, however, are yet to win a race."}

She was assigned temporarily to help the all-male flight research team. Because there were no colored bathrooms in the building she was assigned to, she had to sprint half a mile to the one building that did have a colored bathroom.\nJohnson, a math prodigy, graduated from high school when she was just 14 years old and college (with degrees in math and French) at 18. She excelled in analytic geometry, was known for her accuracy in computerized celestial navigation, and calculated trajectories and launch windows for many NASA flights.\nFellow NASA hidden figure Dorothy Vaughan became NASA's first African-American woman supervisor in 1949, helming the West Area Computing Unit. Knowing that human computers might soon become obsolete as IBM was ready to introduce the nonhuman kind of computers, she taught herself and her staff the FORTRAN programming language.\nAnd Mary Jackson, who also was in the computing pool at NASA, got an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel. Czarnecki suggested she become an engineer. To do so, she would have to take graduate university courses at the segregated Hampton High School.

Plus, I suppose it seems more exciting to hurtle into space than do the math that gets you there.\nThere are other reasons, of course.\nThese kinds of stories get lost in history because in segregated America at the time, black history wasn\u2019t American history.

If you are building new, remodeling, or just freshening up, Shirley Pai Hilton of Kahala Pacific Floors would like to help you with some unbiased information on products and installation so that you can make the right choice for the person that matters here \u2014 you!\nHilton says that the first thing to remember is to always buy quality products that fit in your price range. The old adage of getting what you pay for applies doubly in a competitive market. Vendors will try to get your attention and money by offering an amazingly low price, but that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t pay much for it, either. Always look for a good warranty on materials; about 25 years for home use should be right.\nNext, Hilton recommends always looking for integrity with the company you are dealing with. You may have a written contract, but good customer service is usually not one of the listed contractual obligations. It is also interesting to note that good, knowledgeable sales people are a direct reflection of the company\u2019s openness and attention to detail. That person should be able to offer you good information that will help you make an informed decision. Always walk away from high-pressuring, badgering sales people who call or text you incessantly. They definitely don\u2019t have your best interests at heart.\nHilton said that even before you venture out into the Hawaii flooring forest, get a basic education by attending her monthly Wood and Stone Flooring 101 seminar. The 90-minute session has been attended by hundreds of consumers who always come away more knowledgeable about flooring.

That is the lowest jobless rate since at least 1980 and the lowest officials could recall it ever being.\n\"Wow! That's the lowest I can ever remember,\" said Tim Troxell, assistant director of the Hagerstown-Washington County Economic Development Commission.\nIn addition to new businesses opening and existing businesses expanding, there continues to be a heavy demand for workers, as evidenced by all the \"Help Wanted\" signs, Troxell said.\n\"Is it making our job harder to attract companies? Yes, a little bit. But still, the reason a lot of people are coming here is the reputation our work force has as being a really good work force,\" Troxell said.\nThe low unemployment rate will not only make it harder for employers to find workers, it will push wages up, said Suzanne Hayes, the commission's chairwoman.\n\"That's great news if increased productivity goes with it,\" Hayes said.\nAs she told the Maryland Economic Development Commission on Wednesday, Hayes reiterated that the county needs to focus on bringing jobs with higher wages to the community.\n\"We now need to give attention to improving skills and the productivity of the work force so we really do ratchet up in income,\" Hayes said.\nHayes also wants to see more diversity so if there is a downturn in the economy, the local area won't be hit as hard.\nThe county's unemployment rate dropped from 2.6 percent in March, according to the labor department. The jobless rate was 3.2 percent in April 1999.\nThere's been a lot of activity, with Prime Retail and Valley Mall opening stores and in April stores at the Centre of Hagerstown began opening, said Bill Kelly, Job Service supervisor with the labor department's local office.\nOther businesses that have hired a large number of employees this year, contributing to the low unemployment rate, are Garden State Tanning, Susquehanna Bancshares and JLG Industries Inc., Kelly said.\nGarden State added 75 jobs earlier this year, but started temporarily laying off 400 workers, or one-third of its work force, almost two weeks ago, said Glenn Thornley, the tannery's vice president of operations.\nThose workers will all be recalled by Monday, Thornley said.\nThe temporary layoffs were due to a lull in production as Toyota changed model years, starting production gradually for several new models, Thornley said. The Williamsport tannery produces leather for automobiles.\nThe layoffs had become an annual event, but there hadn't been any model year layoffs in recent years, Thornley said.\nThe tannery is constantly looking for qualified employees, Thornley said. With the low unemployment rate it has been hard to find qualified workers, he said.\nMaryland's unemployment rate for April fell to 2.9 percent, the second-lowest on record, according to the labor department.

It's happened during the Tulip revolution in Kyrgyzstan (today, March 13, 2010 is the 5 year anniversary) and versions of it are regularly employed to control opposition political parties inside the RF (e.g., Anna Bukovskaya).\nNow, as another election approaches on March 14th, more and more Russian citizens are voicing their protests against corruption and an increasingly unbearable economic split beteen the haves and the have-nots.\n\"In places as varied as Samara, Irkutsk, and Archangelsk, disgruntled residents have been joining forces to protest low pay, mounting unemployment, police abuse, and what increasing numbers of Russians see as a corrupt government on both the local and federal level.\nThe largest demonstration, held last month in the Baltic city of Kaliningrad, drew as many as 10,000 people.\nThe demonstration will be repeated on a nationwide scale when Kaliningrad becomes one of at least 15 cities to stage coordinated protests on March 20.\nAnd the protest is not limited to banners and slogans shouted on cold city squares; some prominent Russians, too, are voicing their resentment at the regime built by Vladimir Putin over the past decade.\n\"The rich are becoming even richer, the poor even poorer. Corruption is total, everyone is stealing,\" veteran rock star Yury Shevchuk told his fans at a March 7 concert in Moscow. \"The system has built a brutal, cruel, and inhumane government in our country. People are suffering, not only in prisons and camps, but in orphanages and hospitals as well.\"\nThe recent protests are a notable shift from the public passivity of the early and mid-2000s, when the country was enjoying an unprecedented wave of stability and economic prosperity. Political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin says much of the roiling discontent now is due to the economic crisis, which has hit Russia particularly hard after almost a decade of oil-fueled growth.\n\"Unemployment is on the rise, prices are soaring, livings standards are worsening,\" he says. \"Television tells us tales that we are rising from our knees, but this no longer reassures people.\"\nCuriously, authorities are allowing the opposition rallies and police so far have largely refrained from arresting or beating protesters.\nOreshkin says Russia's political leaders understand that using force to stem such a wave of discontent could turn against them.\n\"Authorities are rational enough not to follow the Chinese path,\" he says. \"They would happily break the arms of protesters, but when these protesters number 1,500 or even 10,000, it's better to find a compromise with them. This signals an evolution of society's political culture, a very slow evolution that is taking place with the change in generation.\"\nAs patient as the Kremlin may be in addressing this growing wave of dissent, I'm anticipating an increase in the use of Russian social media by Medvedev and Putin-friendly bloggers and politically-connected youth organizations.

I suppose I should take exception with the idea that I may never know because I lack the intelligence to comprehend, or then again, perhaps they mean that the mere quantity of mysteries is too great for any one person to behold. Wow, that was poetic, and yes, I opt for the latter idea.\nWhile working 40, 50 and sometimes 60 and 70-hour work weeks, I always wondered how that could possibly be true. I certainly understood why I didn\u2019t get everything done with my work schedule, but I wondered how it was possible that someone who no longer was required to show up to a job either found no time to get things done. Or was it perhaps that chores super-naturally appeared from nowhere, much like the washer or dryer making one sock disappear into thin air?\nAnd that\u2019s another thing. Where do my spare socks go? Have you ever stopped to think about how many marital disagreements have been given birth by that missing sock? Is there a \u201csock bandit\u201d who roams the land seeking out one sock to steal from a wash load? There might be. All I know is thanks to this phenom, I know have a dresser drawer with some of the most unusual mismatched pairs of socks in the land.\nI have a grocery list of things I have wondered about, like how or why does anyone leave just a drop of milk in the container and place it back in the fridge? Why do people drink from the milk carton rather than getting a glass? What set of circumstances must exist for someone to drop their cellphone into the toilet (I really don\u2019t want to know)?

You know, things like, \u201cThe President said today that he was giving Most Favored status to days filled with sunshine and roses. The opposition party said they would fight such a declaration with the utmost resistance.\u201d You know that is coming, but why not spend more time doing some investigative reporting on how my socket set spent the winter beneath the leaves and snow in the backyard when my son assures me he returned it to the garage after he used it. My friend, there is someone lurking in the streets of our city with a vendetta against shiny, useable hand tools.\nI have also wondered who would have slipped into our home and framed my daughter with the crime of painting our valuable claw-foot bath tub with bright red finger-nail polish.

Now, I am not an alarmist, but unless there is a better explanation for such events, I believe there is a crime wave of minor proportions in this city.\nOh, there are many other things for which I have found no good explanation for. For example, a family of five decide to go at a fine restaurant and spend some quality time over dinner, yet each of them spends that quality time texting someone else on their phone throughout the meal.

Which max out at a robust, but not interstellar-ready 29,000 mph.\nBut what if we could traverse those 235 trillion miles (40 light years) with some other technology\u2014like something from the world of science fiction?\nLeaving aside Doctor Who\u2019s TARDIS and all other specifically time-travel based vehicles, we'll focus on propulsion-based systems. Each one of them, Star Wars, Star Trek, Interstellar, Alien, Battlestar Galactica, even the recent Passengers, have their own space travel trope. Most manage light-speed jumps in a matter of minutes. The more realistic ones put their astronauts in suspended animation, but instead of sleeping for hundreds of years, they\u2019re usually on ice for decades.\nWe\u2019ve looked at some of these classic science fiction films and franchises, their hero spaceships and the various guesses at just how fast any of them can travel and applied it all to our planned trip to TRAPPIST-1. Each one gets a TRAPPIST-1 Travel score on a scale of 1-to-5 (5 being the best). At the end, we\u2019ll select the winner and start packing our bags.\nWhile it\u2019s obvious that the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, travels faster that the speed of light (186,000 miles per second), no one seems to know exactly how fast. There\u2019s a hyperdrive scale, but it\u2019s all relative to an unknown base speed.\nSince the Falcon can visit multiple star systems in the span of one two-hour film that covers a few weeks at most, we can safely assume that the Falcon travels many times the speed of light when it jumps to hyperspace. With that in mind, we\u2019re guessing the 40-light-year trip might take the Falcon a few minutes.\nMuch more's known about the fictional Warp drives in the Star Trek franchise. Series creator Gene Roddenberry defined warp speed as something just below the speed of light (.73 of a light year per hour).\nIf our calculations are correct, the Enterprise travels at a maximum speed of approximately 670,616,629 mph. At that rate, Captain Kirk arrives at the seven-planet cluster circling TRAPPIST-1 in roughly 350 hours, which is roughly 14 days.\nThe Alien franchise has faster-than-light travel, but nothing's instantaneous. Ripley enters suspended animation in the time between Alien and its sequel, Aliens. This means traveling a light year might take a year. If you accept that guess (really, what choice do you have?) the trip to the TRAPPIST-1 system takes 40 years, just enough time for Ripely to grab another suspended animation nap.\nAs the name suggests, much of the space travel in this Matthew McConaughey movie is between planetary systems.

Blanco stated in response to a questionnaire from the Family Forum that she opposed adoptions by gay couples.

Instead he has stayed on offense and appears to positioning for the long game.\nIn his televised appearances since last Thursday&apos;s crash, Putin&apos;s demeanor hasn&apos;t wavered from his usual steely determination. He has allowed Russian media to propound theories blaming Ukrainian forces or suggesting a U.S hand in the crash, while refusing to deny such theories and indirectly placing responsibility on the Ukrainians.\nJust hours after the crash, Putin laid the groundwork for this approach, saying at a meeting of economic officials that \"the tragedy would not have happened\" if Ukraine had not resumed its military actions against rebels in late June. \"The state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy,\" he said.\nThat argument neatly eludes a key issue: that the offensive was renewed after a 10-day unilateral ceasefire that the pro-Russia rebels ignored. Throughout the eastern Ukraine crisis, now in its fourth month, Putin and his officials have consistently portrayed the conflict as Ukraine&apos;s unprincipled assault on its own citizens, rather than as a move to take back a sizeable part of the country seized by heavily armed separatists.\nThe aim is to discredit the Kiev authorities without openly opposing them. Putin even spoke face-to-face in June with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who had just been elected following the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych in the wake of months of mass protests. But on Tuesday, he stepped up the aspersions in a meeting with his security council.\n\"True, they held elections after the takeover,\" Putin said. \"However, for some strange reason, power ended up again in the hands of those who either funded or carried out this takeover.\"\nThis is where the long game appears to take shape.\nBy aggressively suggesting that Ukraine&apos;s instability is a prelude to Western designs on Russia, Putin not only deflects attention away from the plane crash, but strikes a chord in the Russian psyche. Russia characteristically sees itself as both a vast and mighty world power and as forever beleaguered by devious and violent forces dating back to the Mongol hordes and later including Napoleonic France, Poland, Sweden and, finally, Nazi Germany.\nEven as he expresses concern about Russia&apos;s vulnerability, Putin also declares that \"the recipes used regarding weaker states fraught with internal conflict will not work with us.\"\nResorting to the contradictory \u2014 yet popular \u2014 message may indicate the tight spot Putin finds himself in as he faces not only international opprobrium but the prospect of even more economic sanctions.\n\"He appears caught, first, by the possibility of very serious limitations from the West,\" analyst Fyodor Lukyanov was quoted as saying by the news website Ekspert. \"Secondly, the psychological pressure is very serious. And for Putin, I think, it&apos;s hard just on a human basis.\"\nBut Putin is the ultimate survivor.

It came as no surprise, as the company has long been a player in highly mobile and slate-style products--especially ones aimed at corporate and vertical markets in previous pushes towards a tablet PC.\n\"There will be a lot of entries, and they'll either fly or die,\" Fujitsu's product manager Paul Moore astutely notes.\nFor Fujitsu's first tablet, due in the United States in the first half of 2011, the company is showing a 10-inch Windows slate design. The slate is running a 1280 by 800 resolution, 400 nit screen that uses N-trig's multi-touch screen technology for doing finger and pen navigation on the same screen. (HP's Slate, announced late fall 2010, already uses this technology, and N-trig has announced support for Android devices as well.) This technology alone makes the unnamed Fujitsu slate a good fit for the company's target vertical markets, which include finance and healthcare.\nThe unit will have Windows 7 Professional running on an Intel Atom Oaktrail-based system with a self-encrypted solid state drive, an option for wireless broadband, plus standard connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, biometric security (a small swipe is on the underside of the unit), and front- and rear-facing cameras and microphones.\nFujitsu expects the slate to come in at about 1.7 pounds, a figure Moore notes is about the same across his competitive set just because of the all the component requirements necessary to create a Windows slate. The price has yet to-be-determined, but \"competitive\" with other Windows tablets.\nAs for Android? \"We've been leery of the Android OS,\" admits Moore. \"We have an Android slate on the roadmap, and it would have Honeycomb. But the regions for distribution have not been settled yet.\" Moore says the Android slate will ship in Japan, but he's not sure if it will make it to U.S. shores.\nAlso unknown is whether the Fujitsu phone displayed at CES will make it Stateside, either. Fujitsu showed a Docomo phone that ships in Japan today. The hook? The phone, in black and gold, is waterproof: Drop it in water, and it will survive. At the least, the company plans to take the technology of the interface and the waterproof feature, and considering integrating it into an Android based tablet later this year."}

Many parents, however, give their little ones a head start on learning by sending them to preschool. In this beginning environment, preschool teachers stay with the same students throughout the day and impart lessons ranging from art to keeping clean.\nStates and employers have different regulations for preschool teachers. Some locations, such as childcare centers, accept preschool teachers who have only a high-school diploma. However, most employers prefer those with some training in early childhood education. Courses in early childhood education are available in community colleges and can last up to two years for an associate's degree. The associate's degree is a required minimum for teachers working in Head Start programs administered by the federal government for underprivileged kids. Many employers running the Head Start programs, as well as those who run pre-schools in public schools, prefer teachers with bachelor\u2019s degrees.\nCertification from national organizations can enhance job prospects because it documents skills that meet objective standards. Examples of such credentials include the Child Development Associate offered by the Council for Professional Recognition and the Child Care Professional from National Early Childhood Program Accreditation. Certification requirements differ slightly but usually demand at least a high-school diploma, job experience and some post-secondary coursework. Maintaining the credential may mandate continuing education in the field.\nAs of May 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), preschool teachers earned a mean $30,750 per year. The lowest-paid 10 percent received under $18,090 yearly, while the highest-paid 10 percent made over an annual $48,660. With over two-thirds of the available preschool teaching jobs, child day care services were the biggest employers offering annual pay of $26,610.\nThe BLS expects jobs for preschool teachers to increase by 25 percent from 2010 to 2020, with child day care services showing 30 percent growth, and religious, grant-making, civic and professional organizations having 17 percent increases. Population growth will be behind the demand because more people means more children.

Here are some answers.\nDid the Trump administration separate nearly 1,500 immigrant children from their parents at the border, and then lose track of them?\nNo. The government did realize last year that it lost track of 1,475 migrant children it had placed with sponsors in the United States, according to testimony before a Senate subcommittee last month. But those children had arrived alone at the Southwest border \u2014 without their parents. Most of them are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse, according to government data.\nOfficials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees refugee resettlement, began making calls last year to determine what had happened to 7,635 children the government had helped place between last October and the end of the year.\nFrom these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. The rest were unaccounted for, giving rise to the 1,475 number. It is possible that some of the adult sponsors simply chose not to respond to the agency.\nLosing track of children who arrive at the border alone is not a new phenomenon. A 2016 inspector general report showed that the federal government was able to reach only 84 percent of children it had placed, leaving 4,159 unaccounted for.\nWhat is the Trump administration\u2019s policy on separating migrant children from their parents at the border?\nThis is where people are likely getting the idea that the Trump administration has separated children from their parents and then lost them. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy earlier this month that included imposing criminal penalties meant to deter Central American families from trying to cross the border illegally.\nIf a mother or father is with a child when apprehended for the crime of illegal entry, the minor must be taken from the parent. Hundreds of immigrant children have already been separated from their parents at the border since October, and the new policy will result in a steep increase. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your child separated, then don\u2019t bring them across the border illegally,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.\nIt\u2019s not clear what has happened to the children that have been separated from their parents since October. This is a deeper explanation on the practice of separating families.\nWhat about Trump\u2019s tweet suggesting that Americans pressure Democrats \u2018to end the horrible law that separates children from parents at the border\u2019?\nThere is no law mandating separation. The closest is the Trump administration\u2019s own \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. And the Democrats did not initiate that.\nHow did the Department of Health and Human Services manage to lose track of 1,"}

Only the staunchest contrarian (or Croatian) would deny that France are the overwhelming favorites for the final. They've been the most impressive team throughout Russia 2018, and it's very hard to spot a single weakness in their side. Hugo Lloris has been fantastic in goal, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann electric up front and N'Golo Kant\u00e9 a pint-sized colossus in front of the defence. 20 years on from their first World Cup win, France will be brimming with confidence to make Russia 2018 their second.\nBut you can't count out Croatia just yet. The only team to win every single of their World Cup 2018 matches (albeit two on penalties and that extra time victory over England in the semi-final), it doesn't require a long memory to recall their 3-0 destruction of Argentina. And with Luka Modri\u0107 \u2013 arguably the world's finest midfielder \u2013 pulling the strings, it's not a stretch to imagine him lifting Croatia's first every World Cup when all's said and done in the World Cup final today.\nKeep reading to discover how to live stream the France vs Croatia World Cup final no matter where in the world you are.

This doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because that\u2019s not my expectations; it was everybody else\u2019s.

Aside from football, everything that we built was amazing: the foundation, the brotherhood, the love that we have for one another,\u201d wide receiver Tyler Lockett said. \u201cThese are going to be relationships that will last a lifetime, not just a season or two and not for just through our careers.

That\u2019s second-fewest in the league, four fewer than the woeful New York Jets. A full, in-season roster has 53 players.\nThe Seahawks have 14 players with expiring contracts due to become unrestricted free agents when the market and league year for 2019 open in March. The most prominent of those 14 free agents-to-br are Earl Thomas, Frank Clark and K.J. Wright.\nThomas has been gone from the team, probably forever, since he broke his leg in the win at Arizona in October, flipped off the team then went on injured reserve.

He had another sack at Dallas and finished with a career-best 15 sacks in 17 games. He stands to get a mammoth raise from the $940,000 he earned this season\u2014perhaps up to $18 million per year in this passer-and-sack-the-passer league.\nClark is still only 25, likely on the cusp of his prime.

The oldest standing residences in America still on their original streets, these six landmarks are as authentic as history gets.\nTwelve French Huguenot families of the late 17th century, fleeing from religious persecution, purchased a sprawling, 40,000-acre plot from the Esopes Indians. They started building the nine one-room houses in 1692. Today, six of them still stand, with various additions made over the years. Most of the enormous structural beams, as well as many pieces of furniture and pottery, are all documented as original.\nRope trundel beds are hidden beneath the main beds, to save space within the cramped quarters. Enormous fireplaces are supported by one large structural beam, nearly 2 feet in width. Observing the meticulous placement of these historic objects, a visitor feels like he\u2019s traveled back three centuries.\nOutside the six houses, a plethora of locust trees \u2013 once used as lightning rods \u2013 creates a beautiful backdrop.\nTours of these landmarks are given from May until the end of October, and the guides are both friendly and chock-full of information. At times, re-enactments of day-to-day Colonial life are presented, with actors donning period costumes.\nA visit to the 300-year-old homes might best be saved for the afternoon, after taking in New Paltz\u2019s more modern attractions. Main Street teems with shops and restaurants that successfully bridge the gap between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and current trends.\nWithout traveling more than 100 steps, one can find beaded jewelry and flowing floral-patterned dresses at the Groovy Blueberry, then pick from a bevy of A-list designers at Rambling Rose. Barner books offers an ecclectic mix of rare titles, while Ariel Bookstore sells mainstream best sellers.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood to whet your whistle on a hot afternoon, the same kind of dualism applies.

You can't be afraid of them and you can't be offended by them. Players today really want a lot of information, and you have to be prepared to give it to them. They want to know what they need to do. They want to know what is in it for them. And then they want to know where are they going to go with it. You've got to be able to answer all three questions. If you have that attitude with the players of this era, I think it builds a real high level of trust with them.\"\nWhat type of perspective did you gain by sitting on the sidelines between jobs in Columbus and St. Louis?\n\"Looking back, it ended up being a very good thing because it allowed me to reconnect with the people in my life that matter. Family, friends, guys that I coached with -- it turned from a very high level of disappointment and frustration for not finishing the job to a really strong reconnection with the people in my life that matter. It turned out to be a real positive for me. I was at a point where I was really enjoying the people part of the business again rather than obsessing with winning and losing. I was starting to really enjoy the people in the business again like I did when I first got in it.\"\nDid you find the obsession over winning and losing came right back and was actually enjoyable when you started coaching the Blues last season?\n\"Yes, but I think what you learn after you take a step back is that when you've won a lot over a long period of time you start to lose interpersonal relationships with the players and other people, and you just become obsessed with winning. You become obsessed with winning and start detesting losing, and so you become short with people and you forget that you're in the people part of the business. I think that by taking a step back and enjoying other aspects of the game made it more fun to come back into coaching. It made me understand what other people do in this game. I learned a lot from observing American (Hockey) League franchises, juniors, colleges. I learned how hard people work for a lot less money and how much they enjoy it.

Gold prices have recovered some lost ground in the last three months,so is it the right time to go for gold now?\nThe impact of demonetisation was severe on gold prices as the government placed several restrictions on buying gold in order to flush out black money. Now, four months after the demonetisation drive, the impact seems to be wearing off and gold prices have started moving northwards from the lows reached in December 2016.\nConsidering that the economy will put up strong performance now that the impact of demonetisation is wearing off, there is likelihood that the gold prices will move up going forward.\nAlso, the dollar has been gaining against the Indian rupee and since gold prices go up with fall in the value of India rupee as domestic gold prices are based on US dollars, the chances of gold prices appreciating are high. In view of these macro-economic and market factors, it is likely that gold prices in India may surge higher and may even surpass the levels reached in July 2016.\nHence, it would be a good idea to invest in gold now to reap the benefits of appreciation in gold prices in future."}

Reed predicted a continuation of immigration problems whether there is a wall or not.\n\"The immigration system is broken and in dire need of a fix. I don't think this ends with a budget cycle of 'x' billions of dollars being moved around in order to build a wall. The solutions necessary to fix broken American immigration policy will take members working together to find a solution that protects the security and integrity of our fellow American citizens, but at the same time retains America as the place of immigration and diversity that has made us strong for generations,\" he said.\nReed authored a bill opposing the national emergency declaration at the end of last month, part of a bi-partisan effort to limit the powers of the president, calling the declaration a \"institutional problem between the congress and the presidency.\" It has not been scheduled for a floor vote in either chamber.\nAdditionally, the congressman said that he has been working with the president to facilitate bringing the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to a vote, and expects some movement sooner rather than later.\n\"We owe it [to the American people] to go on record and vote yes or no on where we stand,\" he said. Whether the measure will find 218 supporters remains in question.\nDespite calling for a return to normalcy following the conclusion of the Russia investigation, Reed asserted that there were still questions that may warrant investigation, not ruling out opening investigations into several parties involved with the Special Council's Investigation, citing Special Agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who he accused of \"carrying out a political agenda\" in advancing the investigation.\nThe congressman recently announced that he will run for re-election in 2020, stating that \"there's work that still needs to be done ...\""}

Under that proposal, if a candidate were to lower their contribution limit for individual donations, a state fund could be created to match those small donations up to a certain amount.\nWhile there is no certain place the money would come from, that would have to be figured out before the law took effect. The goal, according to a letter sent by the groups, is to create a functional, fair administrative agency to oversee that process, sort of like Connecticut\u2019s Citizens Elections Program.\nAnother change the organizations would like to see is closing the \"LLC loophole,\" which treats limited liability companies like individual donors. That allows wealthy donors to spend virtually unlimited amounts on campaigns, opponents say.\nOther proposals include automatic voter registration, early voting, same-day registration and pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds.\nWisneski said the reason the initiatives haven\u2019t garnered more support in the state Legislature over the past few sessions is because the senate has a Republican majority.\nState Sen.

You might not have realized that it was possibly the first and maybe the only modular car ever put into production.\nBack in the 1980s, Japanese car companies faced what were called Voluntary Import Restrictions from all their top export markets. Countries like America limited how many cars Japanese companies could bring onto our shores.\nAll of the Japanese auto industry collectively realized that since they wouldn\u2019t be able to make money off of big numbers of low-cost, low-profit-margin family cars like they had been doing, they would need to move to higher-cost, higher-profit margin vehicles instead, since the total number of exports was getting capped. This is why we saw a boom of luxury cars like Lexus and Infiniti, and why we saw a boom in sports cars and niche cars from Japanese carmakers as well.\nAnd that brought us the smallest niche of all: the modular car, and the Nissan Pulsar NX Sportbak.\nDesigned in California and sold from 1986 to 1990, the second-generation Nissan Pulsar NX (known elsewhere as the EXA) was basically just a coupe version of the Nissan Sentra of the day. It came with front-wheel drive and a variety of small four-cylinder engines, even the most powerful of which only made 130 horsepower. It weighed just 2,300 pounds, but it was more sporty car than sports car.\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s interesting about it.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is the optional Canopy roof.\nWith your Sportbak, you could disconnect the coupe\u2019s rear hatch that ran from the back of the roof to the top of the trunk, and you could slot this wagon back into its place, which only came in grey, partly because it was cheaper and partly because obviously you wanted to show off your cool detachable roof, and you\u2019d have a practical shooting brake.\nI think the wagon back cost an extra couple hundred bucks, which is more expensive than it needed to be, but again that\u2019s exactly what Nissan was looking to try out.\nOr you could leave both off entirely and the empty back made a kind of truck bed back.\nIn Japan, where garage space was at a premium, you could actually rent the top from Nissan where it\u2019d live at the dealership, as Japanese Nostalgic Car recalls.\nAlso, the car had t-tops, so you could go from a fully open convertible, a closed coupe, a semi-enclosed pickup, or a fully-enclosed wagon. You didn\u2019t need to choose what kind of car you wanted; you could have them all in one practical, economical, fun vehicle, one that had pop-up headlights and gradient rear taillights. The only thing that would have made it more \u201880s is if it had a digital dashboard.\nAgain, from today\u2019s perspective, the Sportbak seems like a lark, a fun but pointless idea from the Bubble Era, when Japanese car companies had more money than they knew what to do with. But in the context of import restrictions, it made sense as a sound business decision, at least for a while.\nSadly, Nissan replaced the Pulsar NX with the decidedly un-modular NX1600 and NX2000 for the more boring \u2018"}

But for any Superman story to succeed, the meaning has to go deeper than special effects or an impressive suit.\nIn a recent interview, Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer opened up about what the hero means to them, and without naming names, why Snyder is less than impressed with recent portrayals of the character.\nReinforcing his previous position that Superman shouldn't be apologized for, but honored, it's obvious to all just how important it is to Snyder to do the character justice. Smallville, Superman Returns (2006) and some of the more...interesting comic book treatments are all well and good, but clearly Snyder feels they're not telling the kind of story the world needs at this moment; one only Superman could tell.\nSo if Superman is supposed to embrace the wonder, the fantasy, and the title of the 'king-daddy' of all superheroes, how can audiences be expected to relate? If nothing else, the main goal of Smallville (besides showing off an S-embossed leather jacket) was to humanize Clark Kent, and make him more relatable to younger audiences.\nWhile it may be abrasive, Snyder's unquestioning dedication to the source material is one of the main reasons comic book fans are optimistic that Man of Steel will succeed where other adaptations have failed (if he cares this much, his standards must be higher, right?).\nIt's that dedication that has also sky-rocketed Snyder to the top of the list of potential Justice League directors. But it wasn't simple fanboy enthusiasm or comic book knowledge that convinced executive producer Christopher Nolan to hand him the task of rebooting Superman.\nAfter turning it films like 300 and Watchmen, Snyder's knack for spectacle and action were apparent. But it seems odd that Watchmen - a cynical deconstruction of everything superhero comics supported - was what landed him on Nolan's radar.\nOf course, the actual story set to be told is largely the work of screenwriter David S. Goyer, shifting from Batman to Superman despite the fact that as a child, by his own admission, \"I used to imagine that I was Batman... not Superman.\" Nevertheless, the overarching themes of fatherhood is no coincidence - the film is, in Goyer's words, a story of a man with two fathers.\nThat kind of drama certainly promises something new for the stereotypical Superman adventure. After all, the script was strong enough to convince Snyder - while Nolan and his wife/producing partner Emma Thomas waited in his driveway - to take the job. Yet Snyder has also added a few updates, making the assumption, for instance, that \"Clark Kent is not a virgin.\" How you feel about that depends largely on your reception of Snyder's past writing.\nWe'll leave you to ponder that one on your own time.\nSo what do you think of Snyder's criticism of recent adaptations? Is he being his usual outspoken self, or does Man of Steel feel like the Superman origin story that you've always hoped to see on the silver screen?

Secretary Hagel made this recommendation to the president based on the request of the government of Iraq, U.S. Central Command\u2019s assessment of Iraqi units, the progress Iraqi security forces have made in the field, and in concert with the development of a coalition campaign plan to defend key areas and go on the offensive against ISIL.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby.

He\u2019ll be at Winter Park at 8 a.m. Friday for his workout.\nCarter, a CFL All-Star with the Montreal Alouettes in 2014, said he already has had recent workouts with Tampa Bay, Indianapolis and the Chiefs. He has nothing scheduled after Friday at this point, but said he may also visit Carolina, San Francisco and Cleveland. He can\u2019t sign with any team until next month.\nIn April of 2013, Carter was one of 30 players invited to a rookie minicamp. He was a tryout invitee, but didn\u2019t receive a contract offer. He went to Canada, where this past season he caught 75 passes for 1,030 yards and seven touchdowns.\nCarter, who was born in Fort Lauderdale, went to St. Thomas High School. Bridgewater went to Miami Northwestern.\nCarter has been traveling a long road to prove that he can be trusted with an opportunity.\nHe went to Ohio State, his father\u2019s alma mater, in 2009. He caught 13 passes, but missed the Rose Bowl because he was ruled academically ineligible. He transferred to Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College and caught 44 passes for 690 yards and 10 touchdowns in nine games in 2010.\nHe transferred to Alabama in 2011, but poor grades kept him off the field again. Eventually, he was suspended for undisclosed reasons and transferred to Florida Atlantic. But he never played there, either.\nCayden Cochran, Coffeyville's starting quarterback in 2010, used his Twitter account to post this about Duron a couple years ago: \"The team that drafts Duron Carter will get the most lazy, whiny & non-work ethic player the nfl has ever seen.

He admitted that he needed to grow up.\n\"College football is the minor leagues of the NFL and I really messed that up,\" Duron said. \"I guess I had to grow up.

{"idx": "39453", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: This month\u2019s Synod on the Family in Rome has seen its share of controversy, stretching back to last October when the Extraordinary General Assembly caught clergy and observers alike off guard and set the contentious tone for this year\u2019s Ordinary General Assembly.\nTraditionalists feel threatened by the German Cardinals, headed by Cardinal Walter Kasper, who have driven the movement behind the normalization of communion for Catholic who have divorced and remarried without an annulment. Reformers feel emboldened, if not careful, to pursue the change they see as a priority. Traditionalists feel that they have been put on the defensive, even though they arguably came out swinging so as not to repeat last year\u2019s proceedings.\nFor a Catholic journalist, for any journalist, it\u2019s a fascinating story, and speaking strictly as a journalist, I have no idea how it will end. Speaking as a Catholic, I expect the plot to ultimately fail; where the pope and the historic faith seem to be in tension, my bet is on the faith. But for an institution that measures its life span in millennia, \u201cultimately\u201d can take a long time to arrive.\nApprehension over the synod\u2019s proceedings is understandable, but distrust of the process is less so. The Catholic Church is not in a crisis because of the synod and a schism is far from happening. If the synod is a crisis, as some clearly believe, then what would the conclave of 1799-1800 be considered?\nThomas McDonald, writing in the National Catholic Register, helpfully reminds us about that conclave, but he does not go much below the surface of it. A more throrough study of the conclave of 1799-1800 will better put in perspective the issues of the synod and the fact that it represents healthy debate in the church, not a cataclysmic crisis.\nThe conclave of 1800 was preceded by ominous geopolitical events and a weak pope, Pius VI, who was powerless to stop them. The turn of the century had brought with it the instability of the French Revolution, its hostility to the church and the power vacuum it created that led to Napoleon Bonaparte's rise in France and eventually Western Europe. Revolutionaries attempted, with some success, to turn France into an atheistic state. They abolished the 7 day week in favor of a 10 day week, liquidated the church\u2019s massive property holdings, forced clergy into being employees of the State (as opposed to Rome), and eventually attacked deism itself by replacing it with a civic religion.\nIt was against this backdrop that Pius VI had to rule from Rome. The French Revolution would have been difficult for any pontiff to wrangle with, but Pius was exceptionally weak-willed when it came to decisive action. For example, another synod, one based at Pistora in 1786, was deeply heretical and riddled with doctrinal errors (McDonald points out that the synod tried to end the Stations of the Cross and devotion to the Sacred Heart among other things). Nonetheless, despite the obvious errors of the Synod and the damage it did to the church, Pius waited almost a decade to issue a condemnation against it. His 1794 document Auctorem Fideidid just that, but it came so late that any damage control it could have offered was lost.\nAs the French Revolution brewed and became more and more hostile to the church, Pius did nothing.

The challenge is to avoid data passing through the US after revelations of mass NSA spying in Germany and France.\nMerkel has been one of the biggest supporters of greater data protection in Europe since the revelations that the US tapped her phone emerged in a Der Spiegel news report in October, based on information leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nEarlier, France learned from reports in Le Monde that the NSA has also been recording dozens of millions of French phone calls, including those of the French authorities. According to the report, in just one month between December 10, 2012 and January 8, 2013, the NSA recorded a total of 70.3 million French phone calls.\nMeanwhile, according to the Snowden revelations, the German Chancellor\u2019s mobile phone has been on an NSA target list since 2002 and was codenamed \u201cGE Chancellor Merkel.\u201d The monitoring operation was allegedly still in force even a few weeks before US President Barack Obama's visit to Berlin in June 2013.\nWashington has denied it monitored Merkel\u2019s personal phone, insisting that its surveillance practices are focused on threats to national security, namely terrorism. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, where phone tapping was common practice, compared the NSA\u2019s spying to that of the Stasi secret police in the former German Democratic Republic, and accused the US of a grave breach of trust. According to polls, the Germans have lost confidence in the US as a trustworthy partner, and a majority of Germans consider Edward Snowden a hero. It's believed that his revelations have hit Berlin particularly hard since Germany is not a member of the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u2019 intelligence alliance which includes NSA-equivalent agencies in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, exchanging intelligence with each other on a regular basis.\nIn the wake of the revelations about US global spying activities, the German government has made it mandatory for ministers to use encryption on their phones to secure their communications against intrusion. Berlin has also prohibited the use of iPhones for official business, as they are not compatible with encryption.\nFrance and Germany have been seeking bilateral talks with the United States to discuss the issue of the snooping, with Merkel\u2019s government pressing for a \u201cno spying\u201d agreement with Washington.

It is unfortunate that the writer has shown an unnecessarily soft corner for Armenia \u2014 which is little else but the aggressor and initiator of a \u201ccultivation of genocide.\u201d Realising this fact alone would have settled once and for all the writer\u2019s query of why Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Armenia. There is simply no need for that.\nPakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey have cultural, social, religious and civilisational ties. Even now one can find signs of Pakistani culture in these countries which were preserved by the people of the two countries. While visiting Azerbaijan, I personally witnessed the 15th century Multan Saray in the centre of Baku built by Baku rulers of that period for the merchants from Multan, Pakistan. Both countries share various linkages with Pakistan. Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey have also \u201cstrategic dialogue/partnership\u201d which reflects the real essence and strength of their relations. Governments and people of Turkey and Azerbaijan have been very kind and supportive to Pakistan and its people since inception.\nAzerbaijan and Turkey always supports Pakistan\u2019s stance on Kashmir, the leadership of these countries have openly stated that Jammu and Kashmir dispute should be settled on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Azerbaijan and Turkey are one of the four members of the OIC Contact Group on Kashmir.\nI want to ask Abrar Ameen what can possibly be achieved through the recognition of Armenia by Pakistan? Not a thing, except hurting the hearts of more than 130 million Turkic Turks and Azerbaijani Turks in their countries and in the world who have very high respect for Pakistan and Pakistanis. With its 3 million population, most of them impoverished, and its high and alarming rate of brain drain, poverty and unemployment ratios, Armenia is not a reliable partner. Although Azerbaijan opened its doors to Armenians throughout history but they have time again proved to be unreliable. Recognition of Armenia will achieve nothing but strain ties between strategic partners.\nM Abrar Ameen suggested that by establishing \u201cPakistan-Armenia Culture Forum\u201d bilateral ties would be achieved between the two sides. Culture is a holistic approach whereas Armenian cruelty is well established. Culture is the reflection of harmonious human spirits whereas Armenia is the birthplace of horrendous crimes against humanity. Moreover, climate, nature and natural resources have been polluted because of Armenia.\nSuch a proposed forum cannot be icebreaker because of Armenia\u2019s crimes against helpless Azerbaijani peoplei living in occupied areas. It is not a matter of cultural association alone it is also matter of trust, traditions and tumults where Azerbaijanis laid down their precious lives for their beloved country.

This includes your annual exams, screening mammogram, colon cancer screenings, and other preventive measures. No deductible or co-pays apply as long as the service is entirely preventive. If, for example, you have Crohn\u2019s disease like I do, it\u2019s unlikely that a colonoscopy would ever be considered screening rather than diagnostic. But truly preventive care is free.\nSecond, there can be no pre-existing condition exclusions for children under age 19. Unfortunately, some insurers have, as a result, stopped selling child-only policies, which undermines this benefit. However, child-only policies are still available in many states, and if you have insurance through work or a family policy that previously excluded your child because she has a pre-existing condition, you now can add that child to your policy.\nThird, children up to age 26 can stay on their parent\u2019s insurance. If your child aged out of your policy at age 19 or 21, they now have the right to re-join your policy.\nIn addition, you can choose your gynecologist as your primary care physician, and in any event, you do not need a referral to see your gynecologist.\nIf you have been uninsured for at least six months, even if you have pre-existing conditions, you are eligible for the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). These plans may be run by your state or by the federal government if your state chose not to operate its own plan.\nFurther, lifetime limits on benefits have been eliminated, and annual limits on benefits are being phased out. This is true for all plans unless they have received a waiver from the federal government. Some \u201cmini-med\u201d plans, like those offered to employees at McDonalds and other large, low-wage employers, were granted waivers because some coverage is thought to be better than none, and employers who offer these limited benefit plans would have eliminated them in the absence of a waiver because eliminating benefits limits would have increased premiums dramatically.\nToday we received our denial for health insurance due to a pre-existing condition. The requirements for a possible re-application are to be \"symptom and treatment-free for 3-5 years.\" This is impossible.\nAttached to the letter was a page discussing appeal rights, blah, blah, blah...and at the very bottom was a mention of PCIP and to check the website www.healthcare.gov for more information.\nI skeptically went to the website and within minutes found that we might actually be able to buy semi-reasonably priced health insurance with fairly decent coverage and all our doctors are on the \"in-network\" list.\nUp until today, I had no idea this program even existed and I do not live under a rock.\nIt is a shame that this program exists without any public education and awareness."}

The project showcases 50 spiral and dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way, all of them veritable stellar nurseries.\nThe vast LEGUS collection includes \u201cstar catalogs for each of the LEGUS galaxies and cluster catalogs for 30 of the galaxies, as well as images of the galaxies themselves,\u201d NASA revealed in today\u2019s news release.\nThe comprehensive LEGUS survey is comprised of two distinct catalogs, one that features 8,000 stellar clusters from representative galaxies located between 11 million and 58 million light-years from our planet, and another one focused on 39 million stars that outweigh our sun by at least five times.\n\u201cThe synergy of the two catalogs combined offers an unprecedented potential for understanding star formation,\u201d says Calzetti.\nUsing Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the international team of astronomers observed the galaxies for a period of one year and took visible-light and ultraviolet-light snapshots of their biggest young stars and stellar clusters.\nThe photo collage below represents six varieties of star-forming regions in different galaxies neighboring the Milky Way.\nAs Calzetti explains, the survey\u2019s UV light observations, which were helped along the way by the ultraviolet object collection that NASA previously gathered with its Galaxy Evolution Explorer spacecraft, enable astronomers to gauge the age of stars and study how and when they sparked into existence.\nThis is because ultraviolet light can help track down the youngest and the most incandescent stars, the astronomer points out.\nThe stars cataloged in the LEGUS project vary in age between 1-million and several billion-years-old; those that were imaged in UV light only go up to 100-million-years-old and shine the brightest.\nMeanwhile, the star clusters detailed in the new survey are 1 million to about 500 million years old and are 10 times larger than the Milky Way\u2019s biggest clusters.\nAside from the data on these galaxies\u2019 stars and star clusters, the LEGUS survey could provide important information about \u201cthe connection between star formation and the major structures, such as spiral arms, that make up a galaxy,\u201d NASA points out.\n\u201cWhen we look at a spiral galaxy, we usually don\u2019t just see a random distribution of stars,\u201d says Calzetti.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very orderly structure, whether it\u2019s spiral arms or rings, and that\u2019s particularly true with the youngest stellar populations,\u201d notes the astronomer.\nBy grasping the correlation between star birth and galactic gas, astronomers might finally be able to piece together the puzzle of galaxy evolution.\nHer colleague Elena Sabbi, from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, says that the newly-released LEGUS survey \u201cwill help pave the way\u201d for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, an infrared observatory that NASA is currently developing together with the European and the Canadian space agencies.\nAccording to Sabbi, the UV images included in the survey could help pinpoint which stars gave rise to the supernovas revealed in the data.\nAs an added bonus, the project also provides computer models"}

It is the sign of a deeper and much more pervasive uncertainty, the expression of a shaking of the time-honoured cultural, social and political foundations of Italian society.\nIn this precarious context induced by a struggle for the essential, however, one term re-emerged as indispensable, providing many with a new sense of direction, desire and sharing, ultimately assuming, like a boomerang effect, the \u2018austere\u2019 dignity of that which cannot be renounced: this is \u2018the commons\u2019, the concept and political practice that also informed \u00ad \u2013 among many other \u2018acts\u2019 of \u2018critical\u2019 significance in these years \u2013 Spatial Struggle, an event organised in September 2013 at Teatro Valle in Rome, in collaboration with the Oecumene project.\nThe latter event was an \u2018event\u2019 in a political and transformative sense, allowing a few intense days of sharing, debates, change, creation, and political enactment among artists, researchers, activists or simple citizens who together \u2018made\u2019 the \u2018experience of the commons\u2019 in those days.\nAlthough a central concept for many, the commons only began to be widely acknowledged as a fundamental social practice in Italy following the 2011 Italian water referendum, which signalled the successful effort of citizens to resist, together with a law privatising water services in Italy, a more generalised attempt to privatise public services with an economic value. An aggressive campaign of privatisation had begun years earlier, but the recent necessity for austerity cuts provided a further legitimising expedient in that direction.\nSocial practices based on the \u2018commons\u2019, however, are not simply the expression of a movement of resistance against the private exploitation of natural resources and public goods. What became immediately clear in Italy in fact, was that the defence of the commons meant at the same time the creation of a new kind of political and social bond. A political relationship beyond classes, beyond the traditional and formal idea of citizenship, beyond any identity logics of belonging.\nThis is not to say that those political movements that assume the claim of the \u2018commons\u2019 as their foundation do not begin their \u2018action\u2019 as a form of resistance and response to the private exploitation and depletion of public goods. The 2011 movement certainly emerged in that way. But in its defence of the \u2018commons\u2019, it quickly expanded its range of action so as to extend the idea of common goods (beni comuni) beyond the sphere of natural resources towards what has been called the \u2018immaterial\u2019 commons (health, education, culture, knowledge, etc.).\nThis included, naturally, those very cultural spaces"}

Larson has shared some very impressive exercise videos before, but now we finally have a window to what makes her so motivated: A cookie reward!\nLike just about every actor that signs on to play a superhero character, Brie Larson has been training for months to get into tip-top shape. While working out had the added benefit of helping her get inside the head of Carol Danvers, lifting all those weights can get pretty demanding. Sometimes it's nice to have a little reward and there's probably nothing better than a nice big cookie.\nBrie Larson shared a new exercise video to her Twitter account. The video shows off Larson lifting 275 pounds (!) in an exercise that I do not know the name of and will never personally do. It looks tough as hell, but it's totally worth it because Larson gets to snack on a big cookie, something she is clearly very happy to eat.\nIt's important to remember that Brie Larson is probably not allowed to eat cookies while on her workout diet. In addition to physical training, superhero actors also have to go on diets. As you can imagine, they don't get to eat very many sweets or anything else fun, so that cookie might as well be gold.\nHopefully, all of that training pays off for Brie Larson when Captain Marvel arrives in theaters. The movie has a lot of hype right now and is one of the most anticipated movies of 2019. We've gotten some really cool trailers and people are really excited to see this character finally arrive in the MCU.\nIf people like Captain Marvel then they won't have to wait very long to see her again. The character will be joining what's left of the Avengers in Avengers: Endgame, where she will likely be a crucial piece of the puzzle to defeating Thanos once and for all. The Hulk might not have been able to take him head on, but Captain Marvel could give Thanos a run for his money.\nDirected by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the movie stars Brie Larson, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law.\nWe'll be able to see how it all plays out onscreen when Captain Marvel arrives in theaters on March 8, 2019.

{"idx": "39485", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: South China Morning Post\u2019s Nectar Gan reports on Ministry of Justice plans for a new lawyer ranking scheme to be piloted in Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Anhui and Shaanxi, placing political loyalty ahead of professional ability and experience.\nUnder the new system, lawyers will be classified into nine specialist areas, ranging from criminal law to intellectual property law. The system would help people seeking legal services to narrow their search, the notice said.\nBut lawyers would have to meet four criteria to be listed, the top one being political correctness, followed by record of \u201cintegrity\u201d, length of experience and professional skills.\nThe political performance assessment includes supporting the Communist Party\u2019s leadership and \u201csocialist rule by law\u201d, abiding by the constitution and law, and observing the legal profession\u2019s ethics and discipline.\n.@bequelin Less a noose and more a guillotine, it now seems.\n[\u2026] Whereas at one point in time only a \u201csmall network of notable activist lawyers in China\u201d took on sensitive cases, the Li case mobilized a wider group of lawyers, including \u201celite members of the Chinese legal profession\u201d to leverage greater tolerance of lawyer professionalism from the Chinese government.\nIn July 2015, the Chinese government launched a crackdown against what the authors characterize as \u201cdie-hard\u201d lawyers, who take on the most politically sensitive cases, such as death penalty, torture, and abortion. After one of the first lawyers was arrested, more than 100 signed a petition demanding to know her whereabouts, the authors note in an example of further mobilization. But many of the lawyers who signed were themselves arrested, some detained for 24 hours and some still in custody, according to the book.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s domestic corporate law firms have stayed silent on the sidelines, even though many of the corporate lawyers possess liberal values, because \u201cthey seem content to bury those values under their largely non-political practice,\u201d the book states.\nAs research from the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab shows, online mobilization of the kind seen in support of Li Zhuang has become harder in the Black Friday lawyers\u2019 cases because of increasingly sophisticated filtering of related messages and images."}

With two stories of classic arcade cabinets and guests able to pick up any game \u2013 from Skee-Ball to PAC-MAN \u2013 for just 25 cents a play, plus an outdoor patio on the second floor with additional yard games, it's no wonder the Brady Street bar came out this year's winner.\nLast year, Landmark Lanes came out on top for Milwaukee's favorite bar for games, and Steny's took first runner-up. While last year's winner Landmark Lanes and silver medalist Steny's stayed competitive and came near the top of the list again this year, it is clear that Up Down has stolen our hearts \u2013 and our quarters \u2013 as one of Milwaukee's best new bars for game night."}

Ich spreche hier nicht von der US-Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl des Jahres 2016, die Donald Trump an die Macht brachte, sondern vielmehr von jener 2018 in Brasilien, deren Gewinner der am 1.

Er hat offene Stellen unbesetzt gelassen, Haushaltsmittel zusammengestrichen, etablierte Verwaltungsverfahren und -protokolle umgangen und Diplomaten beiseitegeschoben. Weitgehend verschont hat er das Milit\u00e4r, obwohl er auch hier die Fachkompetenz seiner Kommandeure regelm\u00e4\u00dfig zugunsten seines Bauchgef\u00fchls kleinredet.\nJanine R. Wedel, anthropologist and University Professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, is the author of Unaccountable: How the Establishment Corrupted our Finances, Freedom, and Politics and Created an Outsider Class.\nExcellent article! Its a tropical tragedy, that's what it is!\nProject Syndicate just wont print anything balanced... Its all too establishment and left thinking.. Mind you so is a lot of our press..\nShame.. We deserve better.. Some of us have offered to write for the site and have offered some material but it\u2019s not been accepted..\nOf course it\u2019s been great fun to get on and tear the papers apart and spar with the leftys on the responses but even that is getting old.. not been a real challenge.. Yawn.\nThe problem with this article, as with many published in Project Syndicate, is that it reveals more of the authors' political beliefs and positions rather than substance.\nSeveral examples: She states that influence peddling and nepotism etc under Trump have reached unprecedented levels. Was she not aware of the enormous contributions made to the Clinton Foundation and in outrageously high speaking fees to Bill and Hillary in anticipation that Hillary Clinton would"}
