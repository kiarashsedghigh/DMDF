It'll be another decade (or more) before your digital life is projected into the world around you, viewed through seemingly magical augmented-reality glasses.\nYou know the kind: The Google Glasses of the world, worn like sunglasses, which appear to \"project\" stuff like email or directions directly into reality when they're actually just overlaying your vision with digital information.\n\"Back to the Future 2\" features augmented-reality glasses from JVC, which is hilariously anachronistic and adorable.\nFor many folks in Silicon Valley, augmented reality is an inevitable evolution of the current smartphone-obsessed world we live in. That begs the question: What will that world look like? A new Xbox One and PC game called \"Tacoma\" offers a vision into that worryingly-believable future.\nIn \"Tacoma,\" set in 2088, you're an employee sent to explore an abandoned space station (named \"Tacoma\"). You can watch employee AR logs to unravel the game's story. In reality, that means you can watch their their lives play out through ghostly silhouettes and voice recordings.\nIn the future where \"Tacoma\" is set, employees of the Venturis corporation are working on a space station. A condition of their employment is having their entire lives recorded through augmented reality. As a result, your exploration of the now-abandoned space station is filled with ghostly replays of their lives.\nIn a nod to another potential AR feature of the not-so-distant future, each employee's job is designated by the symbol on their back. Above, the station medic plays a game of pool.\nIf these skeletal frames look familiar, maybe you've seen motion-sensing cameras in action before. Microsoft's Kinect, for example, views humans through a similar perspective.\nThe skeletal frames recorded by the space station's monitoring system enable the player to see a surprising amount of human interaction.\nIn this instance, you can see a surprising amount of detail even with just superficial skeletal tracking. One man makes an argument to a group of people while they react in a variety of different ways.\nAlso of note: ID tags pop up over people, like in a virtual world. There are a variety of less-than-savory connotations to this concept \u2014 perhaps those ID tags also show annual income, or other status measurements \u2014 but in the world of \"Tacoma,\" it's solely used as a personnel badge.\nYou go to meet your friend at Central Park, but it's huge. Where are they?! You call your friend, and their face pops up a foot away from your own on a projected screen. \"Where are you?\" you ask. \"Right here,\" your friend says \u2014 and instantly, a real-world indicator shows their location. Your AR glasses guide you to the friend, seamlessly, while walking \u2014 projecting directions into the world around you. No stopping to check your phone or look on Google Maps or whatever else.

CITY\"\nEvery great 'hood movie has the character who takes the gangster stigma to the extreme. Loud, cocky, fearless and, of course, crazier than Tony Montana snorting on a mountain of narcotics is what makes characters like Menace to Society\u2019s \"O-Dog\" or Juice\u2019s \"Bishop\" shocking, amusing, and quotable. But there is a reason why Kane and Q were the main character\u2019s in those motion pictures: their internal struggles in maintaining the acceptance of their peers at the expense of their own family instilled morals was more relatable and even more compelling.\nFor the BET Hip-Hop Award\u2019s lyricist of the year and West Coast torch bearer, Kendrick Lamar, the well-to-do, Black male youth is taken on a journey through the extreme vices of the ghetto lifestyle with his personal morality and identity in trouble at every turn on his Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope debut, Good Kid, m.A.A.d City,.\nAfter stealing his family\u2019s van, Kendrick takes a joy ride through muffled echoes and flat percussion to meet up with a summer fling on the intro track \u201cSherane a.k.a Master Splinter\u2019s Daughter\u201d. Upon meeting his crush, he also encounters some mentors who introduce him to the L.A. street life. Sounwave\u2019s sultry guitar licks and soothing strings make a perfect background as Kendrick shuts off from his moral reasoning in order to embrace his new-found immorality on \u201cB*tch, Don\u2019t Kill my Vibe\u201d (\"I can feel the changes/ I can feel the new life/ I always knew life could be dangerous\").\n\u201cThe Art of Peer Pressure\u201d explores K. Dot\u2019s first acts of deviance, with a story of doing drugs, fighting, and robbing with the homies. The track captures just how going with the flow can end up with a night of crimes. Up-and-coming West Coast producer DJ Dahi adds his signature background samples and elastic bass on \u201cMoney Trees\u201d, where fellow Black Hippy member, Jay Rock, ventures from his own flow in order to out-K-Dot Lamar out of his own rhyme scheme, resulting in one of the most memorable verses on the album (\"Imagine rock up in those projects, swear them n*ggas pick your pockets, Santa Claus done miss them stockings/ liquor spilling, pistols poppin', baking soda yola whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving\").\nTowards the end of the album, Kendrick starts to question the impact of his immoral decisions on his character and decides it\u2019s time to get baptized on \u201cSing about me, I\u2019m dying of thirst\u201d: (\"My mama said see a pastor, he\u2019ll give me a promise/ what if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?/ The truth will set you free/ so to me you should be completely honest/you dying of thirst, you dying of thirst/so hop in that water and pray that it works\").

{"idx": "14004", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Why did Monsanto's latest GE foods get a free pass into Canada?\nHealth Canada has begun permitting genetically engineered (GE, also called genetically modified or GM) foods onto the market without any health safety assessment. Our government has never adequately examined the safety of GE foods and crops but has now dropped the pretence altogether.\nAfter almost 15 years of approving the varieties of GE soy, canola and corn that we now eat, Health Canada has stopped bothering with the formalities. This complete lack of safety evaluation is not an oversight or loophole in the regulation of GE crops and foods however. Rather, it is the deliberate extension of a regulatory system that relies on corporate data and was designed to support the industry.\nOn July 15, Monsanto and Dow AgroSciences announced that they had received approval to introduce their new eight-trait GE corn 'SmartStax' into Canada and the U.S. But Health Canada did not assess 'SmartStax' for human health safety and didn\u2019t even authorize it. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) officially approved the environmental release of 'SmartStax' but didn\u2019t conduct an environmental risk assessment. Furthermore, the CFIA actually substantially weakened a critical environmental stewardship rule just for the introduction of \u2018SmartStax\u2019 -- without publishing a justification.\nCanada\u2019s approval of \u2018SmartStax\u2019 corn without health safety evaluation contradicts an international guidelines that our government helped to negotiate. \u201cStacking\u201d multiple GE traits together is accomplished by crossing GE plants and the UN Codex food safety guideline explicitly states that conventional breeding of GE plants can give rise to unintended effects and that safety assessments should therefore be conducted. Canada is wilfully ignoring this guideline because following it would require fundamental change.\nCanada excluded \u2018SmartStax\u2019 from safety assessment because the eight GE traits stacked together in the GE corn were previously approved individually in other GE foods. As far as Canadian regulators are concerned, if single GE traits have already been approved in separate crops, there\u2019s no need to evaluate the safety of new stacked-trait crops. Canadian regulations, such as they are, merely limit safety assessments to so-called \u201cnovel traits\u201d, which includes GE traits. Even the combination of eight traits in the case of \u2018SmartStax\u2019 did not warrant examination.\nFor Health Canada, GE foods are not regulated as the products of genetic engineering but are regulated as \u201cNovel Foods\u201d, identified by their \u201cNovel Traits\u201d. Health Canada does not classify \u2018SmartStax\u2019 as a \u201cNovel Food\u201d because its traits are not novel, having been approved earlier in separate foods. If the traits are not novel, the regulations are not triggered.\nThe category of \u201cNovel Foods\u201d and \u201cPlants with Novel Traits\u201d is unique to Canada and includes non-GE foods and crops, like products of conventional plant breeding and mutagenesis. It was created to regulate GE foods and crops without naming or singling out the technology of genetic engineering. By constructing an approval process that is limited to evaluating the \u201cnovelty\u201d of traits rather than identifying risk questions raised by the process of genetic engineering, the government is supporting quicker GE product approvals.\nIn authorizing release of \u2018SmartStax\u2019 without approval from Health Canada, the CFIA has also ignored a safeguard it established in the wake of the first major GE food recall. In response to the contamination of our food system with \u2018Starlink\u2019 corn which"}

Last month\u2019s increase in consumer spending was in line with economists\u2019 expectations.\nThe jump in spending in September was the largest since August 2009 and was spurred by some drivers in Texas and Florida replacing automobiles destroyed when Hurricanes Harvey and Irma slammed the states in late August and early September.\nSpending on long-lasting goods like autos fell 0.1 percent last month after accelerating 2.9 percent in September. Spending on nondurable goods such as prescription drugs and recreational items rose 0.2 percent. Outlays on services increased 0.3 percent amid a rise in airline tickets for foreign travel and communication services.\nThough overall inflation subsided as disruptions to the supply chain following the hurricanes eased, underlying price pressures increased again at a steady clip in October.\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in October after a similar gain in September.

The weak real consumer spending prompted economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as two-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 2.2 percent annualized rate.\nGrowth estimates for the fourth quarter have been lowered this week from around a 3 percent pace in the wake of data showing a large goods trade deficit in October and declines in wholesale and retail inventories.

The plan taxed various types of imported steel at different rates, with some of the percentages designed to scale down over time. He also granted exemptions to more than 75 countries, including Canada and Mexico at the outset, and added a number of other carve-outs later on.\nBush said at the time that the tariffs were needed to safeguard American steelmakers.\nThe EU led the charge in fighting Bush\u2019s tariffs, taking the issue to the World Trade Organization, where it ultimately won permission to respond in kind.\nThe EU slapped equivalent tariffs on a whole host of symbolic items from Republican-voting states, including oranges from Florida, where Bush famously edged out Al Gore to win the presidency in 2000.\nThe whole saga ultimately ended in a very George Bush \u201cmission accomplished in Iraq\u201d sort of way, with the president backing off on the tariffs 16 months early and declaring that they had done their job.\nEconomists were more skeptical, with politically-opposed interests suggesting that the economy had either gained or lost jobs as a result of the tariffs.\nA U.S. International Trade Commission study found in 2003 that Bush\u2019s tariffs resulted in a net loss of US$30 million annually, when offset against tariff revenues.\nEconomy expert and free-trade advocate Gary Huffbauer says Bush\u2019s tariffs ultimately paid off politically, if not economically.\n\u201cThis was a vote-buying exercise,\u201d Huffbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told GlobalNews.ca.\nHuffbauer says Bush \u201cblinked\u201d in the face of retaliatory tariffs because he had already won support to pass a key trade motion in Congress, which made it easier to push trade deals through the legislative process.\n\u201cHis heart wasn\u2019t in it to begin with,\u201d Huffbauer said of the tariffs.\nThe tariff saga also didn\u2019t hurt Bush at the polls, as his Republican Party accomplished the rare feat of adding seats in the House and Senate in the 2002 congressional midterms.\nThe tariff package was initially expected to last for three years, But Bush cancelled it 16 months ahead of schedule amid intense pressure from the EU and the World Trade Organization.\nWATCH BELOW: Canada to impose \u2018dollar-for-dollar\u2019 retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.\nTrump has long characterized himself as a deal maker, but he\u2019s largely only managed to kill deals since becoming president.

In reality, firearms purchased through federally licensed firearms dealers at gun shops, shows, garage sales or anywhere else are subject to all the usual checks and restrictions. Only a narrow category of same-state transactions between private individuals not engaged in the commercial business of selling firearms (family members or collectors, for example) are unaffected by those regulations.\nThere is zero empirical evidence that banning these types of transactions would do anything to prevent gun crimes or mass shootings.

Facebook is trying to find out.\nFacebook wants an awful lot from its emoticons: They should be able to convey complex emotions, for example, like contemplation, admiration, affirmation, maternal love, determination, devotion, resignation, and gratitude.\nBut how, in a tiny digital image, do you depict something as subtle as shame as opposed to remorse, or shyness as opposed to modesty? Current emoticons can't do that, or anything close to it. So Facebook has turned to Pixar story illustrator and former storyboard artist at the Wallace and Gromit studio Matt Jones, to help make something entirely new. He's charged, basically, with reinventing the smiley.\nJones was studying facial expressions for his work on a new film by Pete Docter (director of Up and Monsters, Inc.), which takes place in the mind of a young girl coming of age. The film, referred to as The Untitled Pixar Movie That Takes You Inside the Mind, is set for release in June 2015. Pixar is famous for bringing to life inanimate, and even mundane, objects: lamps, cars, a hockey puck. This film required an extra level of emotional detail. A young girl's mental state is a complicated thing.\nAt the same time, Ekman's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dacher Keltner, codirector of University of California-Berkeley's Greater Good Science Program, was starting work with Facebook to improve their emoticons. When Keltner heard about the project at Pixar, he approached the company. That's how he found Jones.\nKeltner started off by giving Jones some of the classic universal emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) to translate into emoticon-style drawings. He loved what he saw \u2014 and decided to up the ante. He handed over Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, which Darwin published 13 years after On the Origin of Species. The book explores similarities between human and animal facial movements, in support of Darwin's theory that humans and animals have a common ancestor. It became one of the seminal works on the facial emotive expressions.\nSome of Darwin's emotions come with elaborate definitions, but some get descriptions of just two or three words. \"It was a good graphic-design cartoon challenge to draw what he was thinking,\" says Jones. Some of Darwin's findings were too antiquated. For instance, he described the expression of embarrassment as a little cough. \"It's very Victorian. If we are embarrassed, these days we are bit broader,\" Jones says, \"especially Americans.\"\nNot all of Darwin's facial expressions are scientifically supported. Research is still being done to show whether the feelings Darwin outlined translate into universal facial movements \u2014 Keltner, for his part, added some extra emotions to the list. This leaves Jones, as an artist, exploring the same correlations between feelings and muscle movement as leading psychologists.\n\"I was skeptical when I handed Matt these emotions, like gratitude, relief, awe, and guilt, which no one has studied,\" says Keltner. But Jones delivered: \"He does simple lines for facial muscle movements, and when you look at them, you just say, 'wow,' because there is so much expressiveness.\"\n\"If we can crack a universal language, that will be true success,\" says Jones. \"What we need to aim at is instant readability, just like what we do in cartoons.\"\nJones' favorites are the faces expressing negative emotions, like disgust"}

Walking to the green, Stewart said he golfs at City Park five or six times a year.\n\"You can come out and walk around for, depending on your age, six to 10 bucks,\" Stewart said. \"You know, good exercise and a good time.\"\nBREC officials are hoping more people will venture out to their public courses and discover what Stewart has. To help boost golfing business, BREC turned to the National Golf Foundation. Since the spring, a consultant from NGF has gone through every aspect of the city's golfing operation. Their 135-page report was presented Tuesday night.\n\"BREC has a good mix of golf facilities and I think they need to be operated more efficiently and that would help them be sustainable for the long term,\" said Richard Singer, NGF consulting director.\nThe study looked at operations and polled golfers around the Baton Rouge area. It found golfers feel the program is a good value, but lacking in overall quality and service. It also said the program needs to be managed more like a business with an emphasis on efficiency and marketing.\nThe study suggested BREC can get more people to tee off by improving the quality of the courses. The recommendations range from making sure courses are properly staffed to improving technology. The estimated cost of all these possible improvements is around $3 million.\nBREC's new golf director Michael Raby believes the recreation facilities can make many changes without the big price tag. He said it's a matter of starting small and spending money on improvements wisely.\n\"We start with improving the condition of the golf course,\" Raby said. \"That's recommendation number one and for me, it's number two and number three.\"\nRaby said he has already begun to improve some of the courses' physical condition by working to improve the grass and investing in grounds equipment.\nThe study also indicated BREC's golfing program would work best as a five-course program. Of the program's current seven courses, the J.S. Clark and Howell golf courses had the least amount of play. Singer said the rounds played at those two parks were some of the lowest he has seen in the country. His suggestion was that those parks could be converted into parks with other activities that may better appeal to the surrounding neighborhoods.\nHowever, a few residents at Tuesday's meeting strongly objected to that suggestion. Both the J.S. Clark and Howell courses are located in neighborhoods with a large minority population. Some of the residents worried that taking away those golf courses would limit the ability for minorities to participate in the sport.\nRaby said the study is just a suggestion and that there are no immediate plans to convert any courses. The director did say, however, that BREC is looking into the ability for each of its courses to be financially sustainable. He said it may be time to reach out to the neighborhoods around J.S. Clark and Howell to see if a golf course is really what residents want.\n\"As a golfer, I would love for them to remain golf courses, but if we engage the community and the community tells us there's a better use, then we've got to do what's better overall for the community and for BREC as a whole,\" Raby added.\nRaby also warned that changes won't happen immediately and that"}
{"idx": "14040", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Hybrid Cloud: Wave of the Future or Digital Chimera?\nHome Blogs Infrastructure Hybrid Cloud: Wave Of The Future Or Digital Chimera?\nThe hybrid cloud remains the top infrastructure initiative in the enterprise, but it is a huge undertaking and leads into such deep, uncharted waters that it is by no means a smooth transition.\nQuite naturally, as the difficulties mount, more voices are starting to call the wisdom of the hybrid cloud into question. Does it really provide the benefits that supporters claim? Is it really the best way to prepare for the emerging digital economy? What is the real ROI? For enterprise executives responsible for building and managing hybrid infrastructure, however, the key questions remain: What will success look like? And if not the hybrid cloud, what?\nFor both the enterprise and the platforms vendors that support them, the cloud is a prime example of digital Darwinism, or survival of the fittest technology, says tech consultant Phil Wainwright. The initial impulse of many established organizations is to build a bridge between the old and the new, but this is not necessarily the best approach to developing advanced functionality and business processes, because it delays the onset of the new working environment and extends the reliance on aging technologies at a time of rapid change. As Microsoft\u2019s Andreessen Horowitz and Steven Sinofsky noted in a recent report, the hybrid cloud places too much attention on the seam between the old and the new, rather than the functionality that businesses will need to compete.\nAlready, the enterprise is coming face-to-face with the many integration challenges that exist within the hybrid cloud, says Scribe Software\u2019s Eddie Cole (no relation). From data migration and security challenges to the functionality of applications themselves, things on the cloud are radically different than in the data center, so it will take more than just investment in technology to make it all work. Employee retraining, outside consulting and entirely new data management schemes are only a few of the challenges that lie ahead. Without a broad-based approach, the enterprise runs the risk of simply recreating the same data silos that currently exist within legacy infrastructure.\nDone right, of course, the hybrid cloud gives you the best of both worlds, says Tech Vibes\u2019 Rick Delgado. That is, you get the scalability and flexibility of the cloud with the comfort of knowing that critical apps and data remain safely behind the firewall. This is the traditional justification for a fully functioning hybrid cloud, however, and as we\u2019ve noted, the challenge lies with building the proper data environment, not leveraging it when all is said and done.\nAnd the reality of the situation is that before you get to the hybrid cloud, you have to build a private cloud, and on this level the enterprise track record is not good. As I noted previously, attendees at a recent Gartner conference presented a laundry list of issues when it came to their private clouds, including technology and cost setbacks and various operational problems. This was echoed late last month when RightScale, which provides management tools for public and private clouds, showed only a slight uptick in private cloud usage in January compared to a year earlier, while public cloud is still seeing steady growth. Are these surveys merely evidence of growing pains in the hybrid market? Perhaps, but if hybrid solutions don\u2019t exhibit real progress soon, enterprises large and small may simply side with the simplicity of the public option for the bulk of their data activities.\nLike on Wall Street, the primary drivers of advanced data infrastructure are fear and greed. Fear of the unknown aspects of cloud computing ebbs and flows in direct proportion to thoughts of infinitely scalable, eminently configurable and low-cost computing infrastructure.\nIt is way too early to write off the hybrid cloud"}

The mere fact that Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, made specific commitments\u2014instead of railing on about peace and justice, Iran\u2019s usual MO in these sorts of forums\u2014was remarkable in itself.\nThe fact that most of these commitments were made during a 45-minute break from the multilateral forum, when Jalili talked one-on-one with Undersecretary of State William Burns\u2014the first high-level contact between the United States and Iran in 30 years\u2014also signals the possibility of further breakthroughs.\nBut is this good news or bad? Is it the prelude to serious measures that impede Iran from converting its nuclear program to a nuclear-weapons program? Or are the Iranians just stringing us along, making nice but negligible gestures to keep the U.N. Security Council from tightening sanctions while Iran continues to work secretly toward building atomic bombs?\nOne needn\u2019t be paranoid or a neocon to suspect the latter. The Iranians have lied repeatedly about the scope of their nuclear program. The uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, Iran, which has been the main focus of Western concerns, was covert until 2002, when the anti-Iranian terrorist group MEK revealed its existence, which was in turn confirmed by U.S. intelligence, at which point the Iranians fessed up.\nLast week, during the G20 meeting, President Barack Obama publicly announced the existence of yet another covert enrichment facility in Qom, Iran\u2014raising the possibility of a broad network of secret sites. In fact, many analysts believe that the facility is so small, it could serve no function but as one link in a broader network. And the fact of its secrecy suggests that its purpose is not to generate electricity or to power medical research but, rather, to build atomic bombs.\nThe inference is by no means certain, but the burden of proof now lies with the Iranians, and they know this. The Qom disclosure is almost certainly what spurred them to make nice in Geneva to pre-empt international isolation. It is also what justifies skepticism about their motives.\nA little context: To enrich uranium, a cascade of centrifuges\u2014thousands of them\u2014spins and separates the lighter-weight U-235 isotopes (which can make bombs) from the heavier U-238 isotopes (which cannot make bombs), thus isolating and collecting the \u201cpurer\u201d uranium. The Iranians have reportedly enriched enough uranium at Natanz to provide the explosive ingredients for one atomic bomb.\nAt the Geneva talks, Iran made two important pledges. First, it promised to allow officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect and continuously monitor the facility in Qom. Second, it agreed to send some of the uranium from Natanz to other countries for further enrichment; those other countries would, in turn, send it back to Iran to use as fuel for electricity or some other purpose other than building bombs.\nThese pledges are welcome but not entirely assuring. The IAEA inspectors can find out only so much if Qom is but one of several facilities, most of which are hidden. And as for exporting the uranium for enrichment"}

It would take some stiff rules and ongoing oversight to prevent an apprenticeship program from becoming an excuse to do that all over again.\nAt the same time, we haven\u2019t been doing disadvantaged students any favors with inadequate public-school education and graduation to colleges where they lose faith, feel frustrated and end up dropping out, with no degrees or skills to bring to the workplace. Perhaps if we stopped thinking of college education as a cure-all for American students, they\u2019d actually be much better educated."}

I always claim it as the acronym W.I.T.C.H., for \"Woman in Total Control of Herself.\" It has more to do with reclaiming this figure that has been ostracized and demonized. It has a lot of potential as a radical feminist archetype that harnesses energy that we sorely need in this world. It's about being empowered and believing that you can use inner strength to transform your life and create what you want.\nQ: Your book has a little bit of everything \u2013 the healing power of crystals, recipes for essential oils and home decor tips. Why did you write it?\nA: It seemed like an awesome way to share my ideas and what we do in the shop with a wider audience \u2013 and people who have little or no experience with witchcraft in interior design. Treating your home as a form of self-care is having a moment right now.\nQ: How did you get interested in the magic of home?\nA: I was a pretty anxious kid. I tapped into the energy of the spaces I was in, and it helped ground me and feel more secure. It came to me naturally, and then I branched out to wider interest in interior design and decor. I opened HausWitch to put the message out there that energy can have a profound effect on people and animals.\nQ: How can we use modern witchcraft to make our home feel more homey?\nA: I explore themes of manifestation, clearing, comfort, protection, harmony and balance.\nClose your eyes and think about what you want to feel like when you're home. Clean and declutter so you have the ability to recharge. Having a crystal or two brings in positive energy and makes you feel more secure. Clear out old stale energy by burning herbs and opening windows. Use natural cleaning products with a good scent. Bring in houseplants, a living energy with magical properties.\nQ: Crystals are pretty \u2013 but how do they make a home feel more harmonious?\nA: Crystals form within the Earth, and each one has a unique vibration. The healing power comes from the ability of these vibrations to connect the user to the Earth and harmonize with the healing energies. The popular amethyst has gentle healing traits to make you feel safe. Crystals are also wonderful tools for cleansing, comfort, balance and protection.\nQ: Do you belong to a coven?\nA: A lot of people have formed a close-knit community around my store and go to our events. It's like going to bingo every week. We don't dance around in the woods. It's a group of women who support each other and do rituals together.\nQ: Why do we need to follow the five phases of the moon when doing spells?\nA: It's one way of working with nature's energy in our spiritual practices. We all recognize the effect the sun has in our life \u2013 so why not the moon?\nQ: Why is getting rid of clutter so rejuvenating? Do you agree with Marie Kondo's methods?\nA: I encourage people to read Marie Kondo's book. She really understands the way that clutter is dead weight in your psyche \u2013 and in your home.

Photo by David P.

Looking out over Pigeon Park, a longtime gathering place of low income people, activists believe that the arrival of 'Pidgin' and businesses like it have bumped property values beyond the reach of some residents, a process known as gentrification.\nAt a chilly street-corner press conference yesterday morning, members of the Carnegie Community Action Project (CCAP) unfurled a large map of the neighbourhood, with rental building icons colour-coded by price to prove their point. They also renewed their demand for the city to purchase and dedicate 10 buildings a year for affordable social housing.\n\"We want the city to take immediate action to stop renovictions and the upscaling of hotels -- the invisible and covered-up losses of affordable housing stock for low-income people,\" said Ivan Drury, an organizer with CCAP who co-authored the 2012 Hotel Survey report with Jean Swanson.\n\"The biggest problem with gentrification -- which is a combination of cultural gentrification that happens with high-end restaurants and boutiques, and condos being built -- is that the price of land goes up. It makes it an impossible place for low-income people to remain.\"\nThe report, titled \"We're Trying to Get Rid of the Welfare People\" (a quote CCAP attributes to a hotel clerk during their research), found that 426 rooms in the area shifted \"from being affordable to being unaffordable to people on welfare, disability and basic pension,\" based on social assistance rates of $375 for lodging.\nBut the report's findings were questioned by City Councillor Kerry Jang, Vision Vancouver's point person on housing issues.\n\"Who's been displaced?\" Jang asked, when approached for comment on the survey. \"Any new development being built is in buildings that were warehouses or empty to start with. Where's the displacement?\n\"I just don't buy that. It's a very extreme, one-sided perspective of [CCAP], for 100 per cent social housing only. It makes no sense; 100 per cent of any type of housing doesn't work, either rich or poor.\"\nJang said that the City has, in fact, purchased several buildings -- as well as requiring developers to include affordable units in their plans -- and he argued that the conditions of SROs are improving as the province buys and renovates buildings.

Two-thirds of the membership must vote in favor of a strike to make it official. Results will be known either late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, according to union officials.\nThe earliest any strike would begin is Jan. 28.\nThe union turned down an offer for the district around 10:30 p.m. The district\u2019s offer, like the union\u2019s earlier, didn\u2019t present new money to bring the two sides closer together in their financial gap.\nThe day saw a tango of proposal updates, with the district inching up toward the union in its pay demand of $27.5 million toward teacher compensation and the union countering by moving money around its pay chart to increase cash for educators in high-poverty schools.\nIn the end, a chasm remained.\nMuch of the bargaining over the contract governing the teacher compensation program ProComp has been over its structure and how teachers are paid for their continuing education.\nBefore the union left the table about 5 p.m. Friday to discuss the district\u2019s offer, several bargaining team members went around sharing personal examples of how their low pay affects their lives. Some noted the additional jobs they have had to take on during the school year and summer, including food delivery, driving for Lyft, tutoring and working at camps.

President Obama has long supported civilian trials for accused terrorists such as Khaleid Shaikh Mohammed, believing them to be more effective and constitutional than military tribunals. But political and popular pressure from the right has been pushing hard for military tribunals. The White House is still \"weeks\" away from a decision, but they're clearly in a political bind over this high-profile national security policy.\nThe Atlantic's Marc Ambinder explains that Obama isn't flip-flopping because he doesn't know what he wants. \"Officials know full well that Obama himself is committed to the principle his administration has been trying to articulate since its inception, which is that combating terrorism need not be at odds with full adherence to the rule of law.\" But Obama is \"boxed in\" not just politically but legally. Ambinder explains the complex legal issues surrounding terrorist trials and the closure of Guantanamo. The two issues are linked by policy and also by the political routes Obama has taken.\nBut the legal consensus -- the options being given to the president by David Kris, by Mary DeRosa, the legal adviser to the NSC, and by Bob Bauer, the White House counsel, make it clear that military tribunals would be the most feasible option at this point. These advisers seem to have arrived at this conclusion reluctantly, but without prejudice. Goal number one is to close Gitmo, and that means introducing its detainees to the justice system. Goal number two is to bring the 9/11 plotters to justice -- lower-case \"j\" -- because the venue and manner has always been a matter of intense dispute.\nIf he acquiesces, \"Obama will be seen as essentially codifying the Bush-Cheney legal architecture and their definition of the laws of war as applied to terrorism. This appalls the left, and one can see why, because that legal schema was built to make it easier to deprive suspected terrorists of their rights much more quickly and with much less transparency. The truth, though, is that Obama, since he became president, doesn't see this issue in black and white.\" The truth is also that the law, and not just the politics, are far more complicated than many observors might first think."}

It frankly makes no sense,\u201d the writer said.\n\u201cAt week\u2019s end, a flurry of objections and criticism \u2014 from senators, the Medicare actuary, editorial pages, previously supportive business groups, doctors, and hospitals \u2014 together with shockingly negative polling on ObamaCare suggest that we may have finally reached a point when \u2018doing nothing\u2019 (at least for a while) makes immense political sense for lawmakers. The public isn\u2019t clamoring for health care \u2018reform,\u2019 and they might even be pleased with lawmakers who insisted that their leaders not jam through a partisan, ill-conceived bill.\n\u201cIn a sense, Reid clarified what many suspected was going on. The Democrats had ceased trying to craft a workable bill and had decided to pass something, anything, and fix it later. By choosing an approach so obviously hare-brained, however, Reid deprived his party of the pretense that they were engaged in serious lawmaking.\n\u201cThe political headline this [past] week is that President Obama appears to be attempting to move toward the center, or what he believes is the center. We saw the big pivot in two major speeches, one on the economy and the other, in Oslo, on peace,\u201d Peggy Noonan writes at www.opinionjournal.com.\n\u201cIf it is real, if the pivot signals a true, partial or coming shift, if it is not limited to rhetorical flurries, it is welcome news in terms of public policy. It also tells us some things. It tells us White House internal polling is probably worse than the public polls telling us the president has been losing support among independents. It tells us the mounting criticism from Republicans, conservatives and others has had a real effect. It tells us White House officials have concluded they were out on a cliff. It tells us they are calculating that after a first year of governing from the left, and winning whatever they win on health care, they believe they can persuasively shift to the center, that it will work,\u201d Miss Noonan said.\n\u201cWhich is the great political question: Will it work? With congressional elections a year away, will it help make Democrats safe and keep Congress?\n\u201cThe Senate on Tuesday is going to look like a war zone as hundreds and maybe thousands of tea party activists plan to take over offices to play the role of patients waiting for government health care,\u201d Paul Bedard writes in the Washington Whispers column at www.usnews.com.\n\u201cActivists tell Whispers that some will even pretend to die while waiting. Senate staffers say that they are already making plans to work around the protesters,\u201d Mr. Bedard said.\n\u201cActivists are being urged to meet near the Senate at 8:45 a.m. Tuesday to get their marching orders. The call was first made on the Web site www.taxdayteaparty .com, home to the so-called Tea Party Patriots. According to the site, the group is also eager to prove wrong Democratic claims that the movement has lost steam."}

This is my mission: to drink good beer, to spread the word, and to spark interesting and entertaining discussion about the beer-drinking life.\nI am one of those people who get paid to eat and drink. I have been doing it for a while. When I asked Paul McCardell, one of The Sun\u2019s Cracker Jack librarians, to find my earliest writing about beer, he pulled a clip from 1984. Back then I had lots of hair and one small child. Now I have as little hair as Cal Ripken, and my kids, two guys in their 20s, are grown and mostly gone. But as offspring do, they return home occasionally to drink their dad\u2019s beer. One, who lives in Anniston, Ala., and works for a newspaper (you would think he would know better), loves craft beer, especially Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. The other, who works at a financial consulting firm near Washington, prefers Yuengling lager.\nMy wife rarely drinks beer. The other night when I gave her samples of three Imperial Pilsners I was reviewing for today's newspaper -- Sam Adams, Dogfish Head and Rogue --- she sipped all three and said, \u201cYuck.\u201d So it goes on the homefront.\nLike most residents of this town, I am fiercely local. Yet I do recognize that there is good beer beyond Baltimore. When I venture out of town to attend food conferences, family gatherings, or a college-scouting trip (thank the Lord those days are over), I make it a point to sample the local suds. I have fond memories of a microbrew festival in Portland, Ore., a beer-making class at Anchor Steam in San Francisco, and sipping Otter Creek ales in Middlebury, Vt. Recently I discovered there is good beer in the Kansas City airport; a bar in the Southwest and Delta terminal sells Boulevard, a local favorite. The bar, however, closes at 6 p.m. I know because I got turned away, thirsty, at 6:02. I suppose my writing on this blog will be quick and dirty as opposed to complex and geeky. Just for the record, I am not now, nor have I ever been, a beer geek.\nOne of the first places I stopped in my role as a beer blogger was Todd Carpenter\u2019s backyard in Catonsville. Every fall for the past 17 years, he and his home-brewing buddy, Chris Ricketts, have a Saturday afternoon Oktoberfest party. About 100 folks drop in and sample the beers that Carpenter and Ricketts have brewed.\n\u201cIt is a guy\u2019s kind of party, not very organized,\u201d Carpenter told me. \"We invite people -- if they come, fine; if not, it means more beer for us.\" This year, he said, he was inspired to name his beers in honor of Beatles songs. There was Penny Lane Lager, Please, Please Me American Pale Ale, Let It Be Brown Ale, and Octopus\u2019s Porter. I had a Penny Lane lager; it was crisp, refreshing with an unusual hint of sweetness.\nThese guys make good beer and know how to have a good time. Question of the day: What are you drinking that you are liking?"}

Research fresh out of the pan has found that cooked tomato sauce helps to improve the activity of probiotics in the gut.\nDoes tomato sauce boost gut health? And if so, should we choose raw or cooked?\nOver the past few years, researchers and consumers alike have been taking interest in whether or not the foods that eventually reach our tables are \"functional.\" But what are functional foods?\n\"All foods are functional to some extent because all foods provide taste, aroma, and nutritive value,\" explains researcher Clare Hasler in a Journal of Nutrition article.\n\"However,\" she goes on to clarify, \"foods are now being examined intensively for added physiologic benefits, which may reduce chronic disease risk or otherwise optimize health.\" And those foods seen to bring specific health benefits are deemed \"functional.\"\nProbiotic foods \u2014 such as certain types of yogurt, kefir, or kimchi \u2014 fall into this category, as they boost the population of good bacteria in our guts, which contribute to our overall health in many ways.\nNow, however, researchers from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia in Spain are looking at how gut bacteria interact with antioxidants in the gut.\nSpecifically, senior researcher Ana Bel\u00e9n Heredia and her team were interested in seeing how tomato sauce \u2014 rich in antioxidants \u2014 would behave in the presence of good bacteria in the gut.\nAnd, since tomato sauce can be served raw or cooked, they wanted to understand what effect this would have on the antioxidant-gut bacteria interaction.\nTomatoes are considered a healthful food because, among other things, they contain a pigment called lycopene \u2014 an antioxidant that helps to protect cells from damaging factors. Existing research also suggests that tomatoes have probiotic properties \u2014 that is, that they can boost the activity of healthful bacteria in the gut.\nIn the current study, the research team conducted in vitro experiments to see how Lactobacillus reuteri \u2014 one of the main bacterial species that contribute to gut health \u2014 would interact with antioxidants derived from tomato sauce, and how the cooking process would influence that interaction.\nLearn how Mediterranean style diets can improve gut health.\nFor this purpose, the researchers chose to use pear tomatoes, as they have a higher content of lycopene.\n\"We have evaluated the viability of the probiotic strain along the digestive process individually and the presence of antioxidants from vegetable sources, as well as the impact of the probiotic strain on the changes suffered by antioxidant compounds and the resulting bioaccessibility,\" explains Heredia.\nThe results of their experiments \u2014 now published in the Journal of Functional Foods \u2014 indicate that the digestive process resulted in a loss of antioxidants, both in the case of raw and cooked (fried) tomato sauce.\nAlso, the presence of L. reuteri appeared to prevent some of the antioxidants from being absorbed into the blood system.\nAt the same time, however, the research team found that the antioxidants from the tomato sauce enhanced the positive effects of L. reuteri. And in this context, cooked tomato sauce appeared to be more effective than the raw equivalent.\nCooking the sauce also transformed the lycopene present in the tomato \u2014 a process known as cis-trans isomerization \u2014 which actually helped to preserve the integrity of this antiox"}

He called on gunmen from his own powerful hamulla --his clan or tribe -- to protect him.\nDr. Eyad El-Sarraj, a prominent psychiatrist here, is not surprised. \"Who rules Gaza?\" he asked. \"It's certainly not the central Palestinian Authority.\" There is no law or security here, he said, adding, \"The reality is that the Gaza Strip is controlled from outside by Israel and from inside by groups intertwined with security forces and tribes.\"\nEven if Dr. Sarraj overstates the case a little, the mess in Gaza is real, and it presents fundamental problems for Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority he inherited from Yasir Arafat. After 38 years of occupation, Israel pulled its 9,000 settlers and its troops from Gaza in August, leaving it to the Palestinians to run. But the Israeli withdrawal also set off a struggle for power here, and put Gaza's fissures in sharper relief. The world is prepared to provide billions of dollars in aid to help Mr. Abbas turn Gaza into a cornerstone for a Palestinian state that might live in peace and prosperity alongside Israel.\nBut Gaza now seems more like a street-corner society, with the various security forces only more sophisticated varieties of the militant gangs that have their base in neighborhoods, refugee camps and hamullas.\nThe hamullas are again so powerful in Gaza that rival security forces seek to buy their loyalty with money and weapons, while hamullas seek to ensure that their members are represented in all crucial groups, including the militants of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and of course Fatah, which is supposed to be the bulwark of the Palestinian Authority.\nZiad Abu Amr is a Gazan legislator close to Mr. Abbas. \"People in Gaza are loyal first to their family or clan, then to their party, and then to the Palestinian Authority,\" he said.\nThe collapse of the 1993 Oslo accords and the second intifada that began in 2000 ultimately undermined the Palestinian Authority, both in its credibility and power, Mr. Amr said, as Israel went to war against the Palestinian security services that sometimes fomented conflict and finally could not remain aloof from the fighting.\nNow, he said: \"The police, the courts, the security services don't solve a single problem.

And according to The Food Marketing Workgroup, the junk food industry spends almost $2 billion a year on marketing to young people (!!).\nWe all know that marketing tactics and words can be confusing, even as educated adults. The words \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201creal,\u201d \u201cwhole grain,\u201d or \u201cwhole wheat\u201d are just some of the terms that get used in various contexts. If we have a tough time wading our way through the terms, how in the world can we expect kids to have any luck?\nStudies have shown that food advertising can contribute to numerous health problems including being overweight, which, by the way, has increased to 35% of children aged 6-11. Even on a day-to-day basis, it\u2019s just plain annoying to have kids ask for food and products they see on TV that they\u2019d otherwise not know about\u2013products that many of us try to steer them away from as best as we can. And since we\u2019re talking about it, how cool would it be to see advertisements for vegetables or fruits coupled with a kid-known celebrity or cartoon character (hint-hint Ad Council)?\nNaturally, we probably assume that things weren\u2019t as bad when we were growing up. So here are a few related statistics.\nNot only are meals being supersized, so are the amount of ads targeting kids. In 2009, preschoolers viewed 21% more fast food ads than in 2003, children viewed 34% more, and teens 29% more. Here you can find other facts about fast food nutrition and marketing to kids. Each one is concerning in itself.\nKnow what your children are watching, what sites they are surfing, and what games they are playing. Sounds obvious, but sometimes I\u2019m amazed at what my kids are picking up since I obviously don\u2019t watch over their shoulders at all times. Take some time to play the game they enjoy and sit down to watch a full episode of the show they tune into, without fast-forwarding the commercials. Familiarize yourself with their world and know that even school cafeterias showcase similar ads/banners.\nTry as we can, marketing to kids is not going to go away. Neither are processed foods or other unhealthy choices. As a parent, it\u2019s your job to teach them to recognize what is being put in front of them and to help them realize they will have choices, but that they\u2019re just that\u2013choices. Help them understand how to navigate between a smart choice and an unhealthy choice. Also, a tip from Lisa, teach your kids that they can\u2019t always believe everything they hear (including what they see on TV).\nTogether we can make a difference. Urge Nickelodeon to implement a transparent policy for marketing to children that includes strong nutrition standards for all advertising and marketing through the company\u2019s child-directed media. Ask Dairy Queen (or others) to improve their children\u2019s meals.

(Italy), Document Security Systems, Inc. (U.S.), EPL House for Security Printing (Libya), Security Paper Limited (Pakistan), Sequana Group (France), De la Rue plc (U.K.), Giesecke & Devrient (Germany), Fedrigoni Group (Italy) and Goznak (Russia) are some of the prominent players at the forefront of competition in the global security paper market and are profiled in MRFR Analysis.\nPaper that is used to identify and authenticate a document is called security paper. It offers reliable security at reasonable cost and fights the problems associated with such as counterfeiting, forgery, alteration and other frauds. The paper uses advanced and sophisticated technologies to tackle the anti-copy and forgery which generally happens in the printing of banknotes. There are various factors responsible for the boost in the demand for such papers. Factors such as rise in circulation of money, increasing fraud incidences, and investment in anti-counterfeit technologies have pushed the security paper market towards growth. The consumer awareness has led to the manufacturers invest in latest technologies to avoid such frauds happening in the most important documents.\nGrowing digitalization has been an important restraining factor which has hindered the growth of security paper market. There is seen a changing trend, where people opt for online printing services.\nSecurity papers market has been segmented on the basis of features and application. One the basis of features, hybrid papers account for the largest market share in 2016. The market size is attributed to its security features such as UV fibers, security threads, and watermarks. The segment is expected to grow at fastest rate due to increasing demand for such paper to fight the increase in fraud incidences, faking of important documents, such as currency, visas, passport, and others. Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East has emerged as the emerging markets for hybrid papers.\nOn the basis of application, banknotes held the largest market share in 2016. It is also the segment with highest CAGR expected in the forecast period. Banknotes are considered as the most significant document for any economy. It ensures circulation of currency and guides the flow of money in an economy. Thus it is one of the most crucial documents which require security papers in order to avoid scams, and frauds on a bigger scale.\nIn December 2017, Fortress Paper Ltd. announced that its subsidiary, Fortress Security Papers AG, entered into an agreement with the Swiss National Bank and Orell Fussli Holding AG. With the sale of Landqart, Fortress Paper no longer operates in the security paper products segment. The focus of the deal dissolving pulp business and pursuing other strategic initiatives.\nAsia-Pacific, however is expected to showcase the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

Expected to continue for the next three days, it's the highest warning level possible for pollution at more than 24 times safe levels.\nThe pollution levels in Chinese cities have been high for several years -- Zhong Nanshan, president of the Chinese Medical Association, warned that air pollution could become China's biggest issue back in 2012. But why exactly is pollution so bad in China? And what steps are being taken to combat the issue?\nPollution is measured by levels of 'PM' -- particulate matter. PM is a microscopic matter suspended in the atmosphere, mainly generated by coal combustion in power plants, the heating of homes and energy supplies. The specific type of PM so prevalent in Beijing is called PM 2.5, particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. The fine particles of PM 2.5 are considered particularly dangerous because, once inhaled, they sit deep inside the lungs.\nChina's air pollution problem has a number of causes: coal-burning power stations, construction sites and car emissions. The climate in the region doesn't help either -- often humid and with little wind, which further aggravates the pollution problem.\nHigh levels of pollution can cause a broad range of health issue -- respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, shortness of breath and painful breathing. More serious conditions such as lung cancer and heart disease have also been linked to pollution.\nCancer Research UK describes air pollution as being \"associated with an increased risk of lung cancer\". The charity also cites the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which stated in 2013 that outdoor pollution can cause cancer. And PM 2.5, which is so prevalent in Chinese cities, was also found to cause cancer. The youngest victim of lung cancer in China was only eight years old -- a diagnosis that was attributed to air pollution.\nA study by Berkeley Earth claimed that air pollution in China kills around 4,000 people per day -- that's 17 percent of all deaths in China. Linking causes of death to pollution is complicated, however -- many diseases linked to poor air quality are prevalent even without the added pollution.\nBack in 2012, Nanshan stressed that further transparency was needed, urging the Chinese government to invest in more research. And steps have been taken to address the problem. Sulphur dioxide emissions and acid rainfall have fallen in frequency and severity after power plants were required to adopt new technology in 2006. And, in Beijing, cars with odd and even number plates can be banned from driving on consecutive days.\nSmaller sanctions have been put into place, too -- in September 2015 Beijing's industrial facilities were shut down and cars banned from the road in order to celebrate the anniversary of the end of World War II.\nNicknamed 'Parade Blue', the aim was to achieve perfectly blue skies before a parade took place -- and it worked. Whether or not the Chinese government will choose to put such sanctions in place permanently is yet to be seen."}

It requires barring the 'legalized bribery' of major campaign contributions.\nScandals are healthy for the body politic. Like fevers and other symptoms of physical illness, they alert us to the diseases that attack our democracy and its government, and the publicity that accompanies major scandals often leads to the removal of the most toxic agents from the system. Such has been the case with the scandal surrounding Republican super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The revelations regarding his transformation from conservative partisan into ultimate Washington fixer have confirmed, for anyone who was still unsure, that Washington under Republican rule is defined by a culture of corruption. And it has removed from the councils of leadership the pre-eminent practitioner of that corruption, Congressman Tom DeLay, who, faced with Abramoff\u2019s decision to rat out his co-conspirators, gave up his quest to return as House majority leader.\nSo far, so good. But now we get to the tricky part of any political scandal: the question of whether the initial revelations and removals will be misinterpreted as cures for what ails a very sick system. As of now, the scandal has wrought no change in the way business is done in Washington. And there is every reason to believe that the House Republican Caucus will continue to be run by junior DeLays, who amid talk of how everyone must follow the rules will quickly get back to the business of bending those rules in the same direction as did their deposed master. Roy Blunt, the veteran DeLay lieutenant who is the frontrunner to replace his former boss, is not going to change a thing. Blunt\u2019s chief challenger, John Boehner, talks a better line about cleaning up the caucus, but Boehner\u2019s been swimming for years in the same pay-to-play pool as DeLay and Blunt. No one is standing for the GOP leadership as a genuine reformer echoing the honest talk of renegade conservatives like Jeff Flake, who told his fellow Republicans, \u201cWe don\u2019t just need new leaders, we need a course correction. This is deeper than just who stands at the head of the party. We have created a system here\u2026that just breeds corruption.\u201d Flake\u2019s right about that, just as he is right to point out that unless Republicans enact \u201cmeaningful reforms\u201d now, they may be in the minority after midterm elections. An AP/Ipsos poll, taken after Abramoff accepted a plea deal and agreed to cooperate with a Justice Department investigation of Congressional wrongdoing, found that Americans favored handing control of Congress to the Democrats by a 49-to-36 margin.\nBut this is not a time for Democrats to stand by and delight in the disarray of the GOP majority, as they did in 2001 when the Enron scandal was unfolding. The revelations about Abramoff\u2019s actions have muddied a lot of Republicans, from George W. Bush and House Speaker Dennis Hastert to pre-eminent GOP fixers like Grover Norquist and Christian right leader Ralph Reed, all the way down to rank-and-filers like Senator Conrad Burns and appropriately named Congressman John Doolittle. But they have also dirtied some Democrats, including Senate minority leader Harry Reid, who accepted more than $66,000 in campaign contributions from Abramoff\u2019s operations. Reid now says the Republican-led Congress is \u201cthe most corrupt in history.\u201d"}

But, nearly 50 years after it went on the books, I have to ask: Does the law really work that way?\nOften, in the most serious times of public tragedy, we see that Texans have ceded to government officials total discretion to decide what is good and not good for the public \u2013 or their surrogates in the news media \u2013 to know.\nA few recent examples come to mind.\n\u2022\tMore than two years after five officers were fatally gunned down during a peaceful march in downtown Dallas, the police department continues to refuse media requests for release of video and audio from its investigation. Police denied the requests even though the suspect died at the scene and no prosecution will ever arise from the case.\n\u2022\tAfter a 17-year-old boy took the lives of nine students and a teacher at a high school near Houston this year, local school district officials declined a public information request for a safety audit conducted before the incident, even though there is no apparent prospect of any prosecution related to the safety audit.\n\u2022\tIn Austin, police refused the calls of the news media for the release of a cell-phone video confession recorded by a deranged bomber who killed and maimed while terrorizing the city for weeks. Austin police withheld the confession video despite the fact that the bomber blew himself up and obviously will not be subject to prosecution.\nNotwithstanding our stated policy to keep Texans informed \u2013 a commitment that should peak when it comes to investigating the latest mass tragedy and choosing measures to stop the next one \u2013 state law leaves it to law enforcement officials, who are most often unelected, to decide if it is good for Texans to know all the facts. With the Legislature scheduled to convene early in 2019, it seems a good time to debate whether the lofty policy of the Public Information Act should extend to the operative provisions related to law enforcement. In order to keep the people informed and to make wise policy choices, shouldn\u2019t the law presume that when a law enforcement investigation closes, the details will be publicly disclosed?\nIndeed, this was the law in Texas after the passage of our original open records law in 1973. At that time, the rhetoric matched the reality of how the law worked. Police could withhold information from a closed investigation only if it would unduly interfere with legitimate law enforcement objectives or a pending prosecution.\nBut the Legislature went a different direction in 1999. It amended the law enforcement exception to vest virtually total discretion in law enforcement upon closing an investigation to decide to grant or deny public disclosure. Not even the courts have the authority to review or overturn the decision of law enforcement officers to withhold almost any and all information gathered in an investigation of a mass tragedy or other crime.\nNow, with two decades experience under the amended statute where we repeatedly see the denial of public information requests from the public and the news media in the wake of mass shootings and similar events, a strong case may be made that the law should tilt back in favor of public disclosure.\nTo keep the law aligned with our stated philosophy of open government, the act should be amended to provide public disclosure of law enforcement records when an investigation concludes or when prosecution is not reasonably anticipated. And the role of the courts in reviewing the discretionary choices of law enforcement in responding to public information requests should be restored.\nPaul C."}

In the Commons as in the Lords, the government is only in danger of defeat if Labour pitches in with Tory rebels.\nI'm told no decision has been taken for Labour to support the Soubry amendment, but it is doubtless a serious temptation, because passing it would cause huge problems for Theresa May. Here's the amendment in two deadly lines: \"It shall be the objective of an appropriate authority to take all necessary steps to implement an international trade agreement which enables the UK to participate after exit day in a customs union with the EU.\" It would commit the government to a policy Theresa May has rejected and one which would split her government.\nSo the bills are being held in limbo, while government whips try to find a compromise that would satisfy Conservative rebels, without infuriating Brexiteers. Which may not be possible. The Brexiteer line is already clear - staying in a customs union would be a betrayal of the referendum vote because it would leave Britain as an EU \"rule-taker\" and foreclose the possibility of lucrative international trade deals across the globe. The Remainer line is that a failure to agree \"a\" customs union would have a devastating impact on British industry. In short this is a crunch point, and one which the government is keen to postpone.\nThrough a rather unexpected route, a second front may be about to open. Some rather arcane reshuffling of who controls what backbench debating time in the Commons has given the Liaison Committee (the super-committee of select committee chairs) the opportunity to put down vote-able motions of their own. The first motion they will propose, when they get a debating slot, will be on.... drum-roll.... the customs union.\nIt is a moot point whether such a vote would be binding on the government. But potentially it would provide a serious test of Commons opinion. What the Remain side hopes is that it would force the Prime Minister to face down what they call her \"hard Brexit\" wing, and take on board a commitment to \"a\" customs union. She would be able to tell them that they could not get a Brexit without a customs union through the Commons so they would just have to lump it. They believe this cause would bring out all the \"submarine Remainers\" who they believe have been biding their time and waiting for the moment to strike. It might even induce a number of ministers to surface and hoist the Jolly Roger - or possibly the EU flag - even if it meant resignation.\nIt is hard to see the Brexiteers accepting this without a fight. There would undoubtedly be a huge row and even cabinet resignations and that could quite possibly spell the end of Theresa May's premiership. John Major's helpful (sic) suggestion of a free vote on these issues in the Commons would not defuse the threat - just free up Remainer ministers. Whipped or not, the divisions among Conservative MPs will not disappear.\nMeanwhile their Lordships will be trying to create more divisive votes to test the Tory whips and the consciences of pro-EU Conservatives.

She asked at the March 19 meeting for the issue to be placed on a future agenda and was disappointed it wasn't.\nKelley, who works with the county manager and attorney to set the agenda for each meeting, said it wasn\u2019t added because the bill, which county officials fear will change pay for dispatchers, hasn\u2019t yet been adopted as law.\nHe later accused Post of violating a county ordinance that requires council members to get approval before they embark on out-of-county, taxpayer-funded business trips.\nPost, who said she was in Washington in her capacity of serving on a public safety committee with the National Association of Counties, said she wasn't aware of the policy. \"If staff would like to give me that policy, I'd be happy to look at it,\" she said.\nThe squabble between Post and Kelley prompted a discussion on decorum and the rules for running a meeting.\nPost asked that all seven members be given equal and fair treatment.\n\"We can have different views.

To make room for him on the roster, the Red Sox optioned righthander Kyle Snyder to Triple-A Pawtucket.\nThe 32-year-old Johnson, who was designated for assignment yesterday, was 3-8 with a 5.96 ERA in 14 starts for the Indians this season and is 1-8 with a 7.38 ERA in his last 10 starts.

In other words, while North Korea may not be able to hurt a Goliath like the US or South Korea with guns or missiles, it sees hacking as a cheaper way of getting to that result.\nAccording to a 2014 CNBC report, the Hermit Kingdom has pursued cyber warfare since the 1980s, and has targeted banks, universities, and other organizations, mainly in South Korea. But perhaps its biggest hack yet came with the breach of Sony Pictures, which saw the leak of unreleased films and embarrassing emails of studio executives in 2014.\nSouth Korea accused the North of hacking into the smartphones of roughly 10 South Korean officials earlier this year, according to Yonhap.\nNorth Korea has approximately 6,000 trained hackers in its military ranks, a defector from the country told the BBC. The defector taught computer science at a Pyongyang University and said many of his former students went on to the hacking unit known as Bureau 121.\nLittle is known about the North Korea's cyberwarfare agency, though it does seem to employ considerable computer expertise. With its Sony Pictures breach, the hackers used a common method to gain access called spear-phishing and were able to steal credentials for a systems administrator, enabling them to burrow inside the systems for at least two months to map out their plan of attack.\nEarlier this year, a top US Army General asserted in Senate testimony that North Korea had some of the world's best hackers.\n\"While I would not characterize them as the best in the world, they are among the best in the world and the best organized,\" Gen.

Mayor Jenny Durkan already has signed Seattle City Council Resolution 31867 supporting a bill by U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, to establish a Medicare for All national health insurance program. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is introducing a single-payer bill in the Senate.\nBoth bills purport to provide everyone in the country with affordable health care on demand. With no chance of a hearing in the Senate, and a guaranteed veto from the current president, neither has a chance of passing. The president says he has a \u201cspectacular\u201d health-care plan, which we all know won\u2019t make it through the Democratic Party-led House of Representatives.\nWhile they\u2019re pretending to do something, it might be useful for the rest of us to actually identify the qualities we want in a health-care system. Using the country\u2019s vision statement, the preamble to the Constitution, as our guide, what would it take to create a plan that would ensure \u201ca more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\u201d?\nWe must begin with clear definitions. Are we a loose collection of individuals bound by our existence within artificially drawn lines in the dirt, or citizens committed to the vision decreed in the preamble? Are we committed to individual success or the general welfare? Do we secure Blessings of Liberty for ourselves or extend them for generations to come? The answers to these questions must form the basis of our national strategic plan \u2014 the foundation of all national policy.\nIf we are simply a collection of individuals, content to have some relegated to failure so others can succeed, our health-care system would be built on a win-lose model. Health-related companies would assure high dividends for stockholders or owners. Because stock values are based on profit, steadily increasing high prices for insurance premiums, medication and medical services would be required to meet those quarterly and annual goals. To ensure profits for themselves, employers would deduct an increasingly larger portion of employees\u2019 salaries to cover health-care costs. Individuals with the highest medical need would pay the largest percentage of their salaries to health insurance until many would opt out of the system altogether. Individuals not receiving insurance through their employers would be forced to shop for the best plan they can afford, which may not meet their actual health-care needs. To use examples from the current social media cycle: Felicity Huffman\u2019s profligate daughter would have complete access to any health care she needs, while the young, homeless chess champion would have only what charity can provide.\nIf we are citizens committed to the general welfare, an all-inclusive vision of health care, the driving question would be, \u201cHow do we provide excellent medical care for all of our citizens?\u201d We would remove the specter of shareholder/owner value from the system. No basic health-related company would be publicly traded. No one would become rich because people are sick. Hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical facilities would be run for the benefit of all. They would revert to their original functions as nonprofit charities or government-run services. There would be one insurer, the federal government, accountable to the people via our elected officials.

Paul pushed the Kentucky GOP to host a caucus instead of a primary, which would allow him to run for both offices\u2014and he footed the $250,000 bill.\nAltogether, this paints a picture of a campaign on life support.\nBut the campaign doesn\u2019t see it that way and instead points to signs of life: in the two weeks after the second Republican debate, it raised $750,000. The campaign insists there will be no shakeups or changes in strategy, that Paul will continue his campaign schedule in the early states and regions off the beaten track, and that it has enough resources to carry the candidate through at least the first four primaries. This week, the campaign rolled out a list of caucus state endorsements.\nIt has been death by a thousand cuts for Paul\u2019s campaign: reports of staff infighting, the federal indictments of two longtime aides, lackluster fundraising, the improbable and unpredictable rise of Donald Trump, and a Republican Party that appears to be returning to its roots on foreign policy.\nNext week, we might just learn how much longer Paul can keep going.\nThe third-quarter fundraising period ends Wednesday, and one of the biggest questions will be whether Paul has raised enough money to continue his quest.\nAs another fundraising period ends, what now constitutes success for Bush isn\u2019t as clear cut.

They are. In the past, charitable giving has indeed increased when government aid was restricted, or when the public saw genuine human need. Yet even the largest private charities can marshal only a fraction of the funds government can.\nMore important, calls for charity overlook how government cuts will affect what middle-class Americans do with their money. Once middle- class families see that there will be little public support for their economic security, they will rationally decide to preserve their own assets. To the extent they remain charitable, people of means are likely to favor schools, churches, hospitals and organizations they can use themselves. Altruism does not sustain charity; a sense of shared benefits does.\nHaving worked in the private sector all my career, I acknowledge how onerous and impersonal tax-supported social welfare programs can be. I applaud new ideas for incorporating private organizations into their operation.

Produced by the band and Def Jam artist Davy D., Leather shows that Run-D.M.C. has learned its lessons well from previous producers Russell Simmons, Larry Smith and Rick Rubin. \u201cRun\u2019s House,\u201d the initial single, kicks the album off with a strident declaration of beat-box supremacy. \u201cPapa Crazy,\u201d a keyboard-and-drum-driven tale of a carousin\u2019 and tomcattin\u2019 father, serves as a sly, stylistic update of the Temptations\u2019 1972 classic \u201cPapa Was a Rollin\u2019 Stone.\u201d But it\u2019s the kinetic rush of \u201cI\u2019m Not Going Out Like That\u201d that shows off the swaggering rhymes and beats of Joe Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell to best advantage.\nNo matter how good some of the new material is, there\u2019s an underlying timidity on Tougher Than Leather that is troubling. Perhaps the group has been shackled by success, because there\u2019s nothing on the album as uncompromising as earlier tracks like \u201cHard Times,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Like That\u201d and \u201cProud to Be Black.\u201d It seems as if Run-D.M.C. has let the likes of Public Enemy and Ice T take over the more militant and politically aware hip-hop turf.\nThematically and musically, Run-D.M.C. has started to repeat itself. The updating of the Monkees\u2019 \u201cMary, Mary,\u201d the only track in which Rick Rubin had a hand, is humorous, but it appears to be a blatant attempt to follow in the lucrative footsteps of \u201cWalk This Way.\u201d Further, \u201cSoul to Rock and Roll,\u201d \u201cTougher Than Leather\u201d and \u201cMiss Elaine\u201d are hamstrung by either tiring braggadocio or predictable rock-guitar rhythms.\nIn the end, Tougher Than Leather doesn\u2019t raise hell, but it does raise more questions than it answers. While the members of Run-D.M.C. aren\u2019t yet in danger of losing their self-applied titles as the kings of rock, the future is far less certain than it was two years ago. In the wake of"}

For a Russian perspective, David Greene talks to Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of the journal, Russia In Global Affairs.\nNow elsewhere in the program this morning, NATO's deputy secretary general told us that Russia has moved troops and tanks into eastern Ukraine. The Russian government furiously denies that it is directly aiding pro-Russian separatists and that any Russians who may be in Ukraine are volunteers. For a Russian perspective on all of this, we have on the line Fyodor Lukyanov. He's editor-in-chief of the journal Russia In Global Affairs and a predominant foreign affairs analyst in Moscow. Mr. Lukyanov, good morning.\nGREENE: So President Vladimir Putin says the Russian military is not in Ukraine. Who is telling the truth here?\nLUKYANOV: I don't know because unfortunately the (unintelligible) situation looks like a real information war. And we hear a lot of statements from all sides, the Russian, Ukrainian, Western European, American, which are not fully confirmed or not profoundly grounded. I think we can judge based on situation on the ground. And on the ground, that's quite obvious that the dynamics of armed conflict has changed profoundly since several days. And the rebels, the pro-Russian forces, are gaining new territories while Ukrainian Army is retreating. And they have to defend cities which they recaptured recently or even a while ago.\nGREENE: All of which suggests that there is some kind of Russian support coming in, perhaps it's volunteers that the Russian government said are actual forces. But, you know, Russia's playing a role here - why? What is President Putin after in eastern Ukraine?\nLUKYANOV: If we look at the short-term goal, I think it's quite obvious. The continuation of the very slow peace process which started recently - and in conflicts like this armed actions and war is unfortunately part of political discussion.\nGREENE: Well, let me ask you this; presumably Vladimir Putin feels like he didn't get exactly what he wanted, and so he is continuing to use force on the ground in some way to try and negotiate as you say. What exactly does he want out of some sort of compromise?\nGREENE: Who is the Ukrainian President.\nLUKYANOV: ...This war is unwinnable for you. If you believe that you can prevail militarily, forget about it. And that will continue as long as Poroshenko or Ukrainian fighters (unintelligible) reject to discuss serious political concessions.\nGREENE: And political concessions would be what? What sort of political concession does Russia want or need out of all this?\nLUKYANOV: At least until recently, I think the goal was to force Ukrainian leadership to accept leadership of rebel movement as part of negotiations.\nGREENE: And finally, politically is it really important for Vladimir Putin to come out of this in some way that he can call it a victory?\nLUKYANOV: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Stocks in Europe moved up, yields on Italian and Spanish bonds fell a bit, while the euro was up a tad against the dollar. Investors, used to seeing summits where little was achieved, were relieved that at least some progress has been made to curb fiscal profligacy. There is also the little fudge of lending \u20ac200 billion to the International Monetary Fund, so that it can lend this back to cash-strapped European governments. That neatly sidesteps the prospect of convincing the German electorate to help its struggling cousins in Italy or Spain, although its legality could be questioned.\nBut these steps are not enough to ease the uncertainty. The concerns about the recapitalization needs of European banks remain and nothing has been said about the need for the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy the sovereign debt of countries in difficulties. Indeed, ECB president Mario Draghi explicitly denied any such move a day before the summit.\nA large part of the fiscal plan is merely a rehash of the earlier \u201cStability and Growth Pact\", which proved to be unenforceable. No attempt has been made to boost the bailout fund, which may not be large enough. And with Britain opting to stay out of any agreement, the legal repercussions of the \u201cfiscal compact\" are unclear. The road ahead is going to be slow, tortuous and tricky.\nThe biggest failure of European leaders, however, is that they are contemplating not a fiscal union, but an austerity programme. At a time when the euro zone is slipping into a recession, such a plan will only add to the distress in the euro periphery. In short, while some of ECB\u2019s measures may ease liquidity pressures and help the banks, the summit has done little to reduce the fundamental problems that afflict the euro zone. Much will now depend on whether Standard and Poor\u2019s carries out its threat of a mass downgrade."}

According to Rosen, you\u2019ll have to determine if it\u2019s better to move the parent to a place or have a live-in nurse provide care in the current residence.\nWhen it comes to starting the conversation with parents, Flynn advises being as direct as possible. The main reason people resist the idea of a nursing home or assisted living is over fear of losing their independence. Some parents are also in denial about needing care and help, which can also make the conversation tough. Flynn says when talking about care options, you should provide parents evidence of why they need help: Point out aimless wondering, forgetting to turn off the stove and the dangers that came with these actions.\nIt\u2019s also important to make it clear to parents they are not a burden and that you are not trying pass off their care and simply want them to have the best options and lifestyle. Children should put forth a well-discussed and thorough plan to their parents that covers financials.\nIf possible, Rosen suggests asking parents what they want from a facility, including location and amenities, to get them involved in the decision. Same goes with at-home care. If they can, have them discuss who they would want to be the caregiver whether it\u2019s a relative, friend or professional.\nIf possible, Flynn says it\u2019s a good idea to take the parent to visit possible places to talk to the staff and residents."}

Via its Thursday previews, the live-action adaptation of the beloved 1991 animated classic has earned a whopping $16.3 million. That is the second-biggest such preview figure ever for any G or PG-rated movie behind Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ($22m in 2009). That\u2019s also a larger Thursday preview number than Iron Man 3, Furious 7 and the last Hunger Games movie. Unless Beauty and the Beast plays like a Twilight sequel, we\u2019re looking at one of the biggest debut weekends of all time.\nFor the record, a run like Iron Man 3 or Furious 7 would give the $160 million musical romance an opening of between $151m and $181m. If it plays like The Hunger Games back in 2012 ($19.5m midnight/$152m weekend), it gets to around $130m for the weekend. But there is zero precedent for a film like Beauty and the Beast pulling a Thursday preview number this high.\nYou can toss out every animated film and every live-action fairy tale you can think of because none of them (presumably) apply this time out. Beauty and the Beast is playing like a super-duper anticipated mega-blockbuster right out of the gate. Obviously, a $16.3 million Thursday figure means the Emma Watson/Dan Stevens romance will be a bit more front-loaded than The Jungle Book ($4.1m/$103m) or even Maleficent ($4.2m/$69.3m).\nBut how frontloaded will it be? The worst-case scenario is that it plays like a late-stage Harry Potter sequel or a Twilight sequel and pulls around 20% of its money last night, which would give it an $82 million weekend. I think we can all agree that Beauty and the Beast is going to do better than $82m this weekend.\nA run like The Avengers or Jurassic World (over/under 9% of the weekend on Thursday) gives the film a whopping $181 million weekend, which is entirely plausible at this juncture. The 127-minute, non-sequel, female-targeted, romantic drama just snagged $16.3m on a Thursday during a school week. Even if some kids are off/will be off for Spring Break already, that\u2019s insane. Sure, that may mean a mere 12% Thursday figure, but even that would be a huge $135m debut weekend.\nWith interest running high and the film playing to every plausible quadrant, I wouldn\u2019t be remotely surprised to see a $170-$180 million debut, although that is not remotely the bar for success. The film has earned mixed-positive reviews, and none of the pans are the sort that will chase away the already-intrigued. Fandango has been reporting record-busting pre-sales for a family title, and the film is the first of these Disney live-action adaptations to revamp a comparatively recent animated picture.\nAnd yeah, the film will have an advantage of being a girl-powered romance amid a month of action blockbuster-y titles.

In addition to giving another sneak peek at its Galaxy Fold foldable phone, the company took the wraps off four Galaxy S10 phones: the Galaxy S10, the Galaxy S10 Plus, the Galaxy S10E and the Galaxy S10 5G. The new family of handsets not only serve as the successors to last year's popular Galaxy S9 phones, but one of the S10 phones is also compatible with the next generation of mobile network known as 5G.\nThe main flagship devices are the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus and were released on March 8. The S10 features a 6.1-inch display, three rear cameras and a single front-facing camera. The S10 Plus, meanwhile, is a bit larger with a 6.4-inch screen. The bigger display is accommodated with a higher-capacity battery (a 4,100-mAh battery compared to the Galaxy S10's 3,400-mAh one). It, too, has three rear cameras, but Samsung added a second 8-megapixel front-facing camera.\nBoth phones are larger than last year's Galaxy S9, which had a 5.8-inch screen. The Galaxy S9 also only had a single 12-megapixel rear camera, a Snapdragon 845 processor and less expandable memory (up to 400GB compared to the Galaxy S10s' 512GB). The Galaxy S9 had a smaller, third memory option too. It had a 64GB tier, while the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus start at 128GB and 512GB, respectively.\nNew to the Galaxy lineup is the Galaxy S10E.

After completing a one-year master luthier program, in which he learned to make hollow- and solid-body guitars, Eady took a job at the Gibson Custom Shop in Nashville, Tenn. There, he helped repair up to 70 guitars a day, including Dickey Betts's 1958 Les Paul. Then, as head finisher for Benedetto Guitars, Eady applied lacquer to make the grain come to life. \"Finishing makes or breaks your instrument,\" he says. \"It's my favorite part.\" This year, Eady opened his own shop, focusing on finishing and repair, but he plans to one day build signature guitars. \"There's an instant bond between you and the musicians you're building for,\" he says. \"Not to mention it's cool as hell to play an instrument you've made.\"\nThe sound of the guitar is influenced by the wood used for the body. Mahogany creates rich, warm tones; cedar yields mellow ones. The neck must be able to withstand string tension, so Eady uses harder woods like maple.\nEady employs a band saw to cut out the shape and design of the guitar, and a router to carve the electronics and pickup cavities and the area where the neck attaches to the body. He starts with a 20 x 9\u2013inch board, which he mills, squares and saws down the middle. When the pieces are glued together, forming the guitar top, the grain is a mirror image of itself. \"It looks more attractive, and the guitar ages better,\" Eady says. The top is glued to a mahogany body. Next, he cuts the neck profile out of a square piece of wood and joints the face of the neck where the fingerboard will be glued. \"You use that fingerboard as a template to rout out the neck shape,\" Eady says. Then he adds frets.\nAfter he glues the neck to the body, Eady sands the guitar and applies color (pigmented lacquer) or toner (translucent, colored lacquer) using an HVLP (high-volume, low-pressure) spray system. He then sprays it with a clear coat of nitrocellulose lacquer and buffs it to a high gloss.\nNext, Eady inserts the tuning machines, volume and tone controls and bridge, and installs the pickup.

{"idx": "14134", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Though it\u2019s common not to have a password on a home computer, and some even skip it on their personal mobile devices, it\u2019s the first and most important barrier protecting a company's data. Windows 8 will provide a number of ways of securing your password, and Microsoft recently talked more about a feature called Picture Password as a new way to authenticate without standard passwords and pins. Will this feature have your business tapping and drawing its way to more secure devices?\nTraditionally, authenticating to a device involves typing in a password or PIN. Unfortunately, users tend to choose passwords that are easy to remember, or using characters that they relate to. This makes it easier for attackers who know something about you to guess passwords. Character-based passwords are also vulnerable to keylogging, where malware installed on the device can detect the specific keystrokes and easily reproduce them.\nA newer authentication technique involves drawing on a device's touchscreen. Google has a patent pending on its Android pattern-based unlock screen, in which you connect dots in a nine-dot grid. A drawback of this method is that it tends to leave smudges on the screen, so that an attacker with possession of the device could see the pattern.\nHow setting up a Picture Password will look.\nMicrosoft's Picture Password for the upcoming Windows 8 was designed to avoid the issues that accompany keyboard and pattern-based passwords. The technique starts with you providing a picture. You can position the picture as you like, and are then prompted to make gestures on the picture that become your authentication signature. There are three gesture types you can use; a tap, a circle, and a line. In a demo video at the bottom of this Windows blog post, the demonstrator draws a picture around his father\u2019s head, connects his sister\u2019s noses with a line, and taps on his mother\u2019s nose.\nEach gesture you make must be in the correct order and proper position, and have the proper directionality. While a single tap isn\u2019t very secure, offering only 270 acceptable inputs, using eight taps increases the options to over 13 quadrillion inputs. Circles are even more complex, with seven circles providing almost one quintillion options.\nThe point of Picture Password is not just to increase the complexity of passwords, but to provide a secure login that is faster than on a touch keyboard. With as few as three gestures, a Picture Password can still provide over one trillion combinations, compared with 81,120 for character-based, and 1,000 for numeric, while still taking an average of less than four seconds to complete.\nPictures Password still requires a touchscreen, though Microsoft mentions that it can be utilized with a mouse. So, aren\u2019t smudges still a problem? Yes, you\u2019re still likely to leave smudges on your screen when entering a Picture Password. But, even if your screen were perfectly clean and three gestures were clearly visible on it, order and directionality complicate its replication. Those three specific gestures still have over one billion possible combinations.\nPicture Password is not a replacement for the traditional text-based password. In fact, you\u2019ll need to enter your password before creating a Picture Password, or if that password is attempted five times incorrectly. Nor will it protect you from someone looking over your shoulder while you log in.\nSo, will this be useful for Windows 8? On mobile touchscreen devices, its combination of a personalized picture and a higher level of security should make it a desirable and possibly mandatory feature. But, with most business desktops and laptops not having"}

Fall is the perfect time to tour this scenic byway as trees shed their summer green for the reds, oranges, and yellows of fall.\nIt takes about two hours to drive straight through with a few stops. Campsites are available along the drive, so if your schedule allows, you can spend a few days exploring the mountain wilderness.\nOn the Arkansas end, the two-lane asphalt road is a little weathered, and in most areas cellular signal is intermittent at best. Welcome to the wilderness. Heading west out of Mena, Ark., a sign advises, \"Crooked and steep hills next 15 miles,\" and the squiggly line provides a hint of the drive to come. In some places along the drive, the speed limit will drop to 15 or 20 mph for hairpin curves, and even skilled drivers will do well to heed those warnings.\nAbout 8 miles west of Mena, the trail reaches the highest point in the Ouachitas: 2681-foot Rich Mountain. The 58-foot Rich Mountain Fire Tower stands lookout atop the peak, and it is open to the public on summer weekend afternoons.\nTwo miles to the west, Queen Wilhemina State Park also sits atop Rich Mountain. Dutch railroad investors who built a luxury hotel on the site in 1898, the year of her coronation, named the park in honor of the queen of the Netherlands. The Victorian lodge is currently closed for renovation, but in early 2014, it will again offer rooms for $70 to $120 a night. The state park also offers tent and RV camping, as well as hiking trails, a picnic area, a gift shop, and a miniature golf course.\nNine miles further west, the drive crosses into Oklahoma and the Winding Stair National Recreation Area. These are the same mountains through which John Wayne pursued Lucky Ned's gang in the 1969 movie True Grit. The U.S. Army's supply road from Fort Smith, Ark., to Fort Towson, Okla., crosses the highway at the Old Military Road Historic Site just before the end of the drive.\nRoad conditions improve slightly on the Oklahoma side. A local driver told PopMech, \"The thing about the Oklahoma side of the drive is that when you think you get to the top, it just goes up.\" The scenic drive winds and climbs through green, shaded forest and rocky slopes, where drivers have several opportunities to pull off and take in scenic views of valleys and distant slopes.

I figured that one day, after saving up enough money, I would escape to the Colorado wilderness, where I could live in Denver Bronco country, let my beard grow and write my first novel.\nBut I discovered Bleacher Report over Thanksgiving break in 2010, my sophomore year of college, and after a month of being a daily reader, I realized I might be able to call myself a writer sooner than I had thought.\nDuring Christmas break, while recovering from a candied ham hangover, I noticed that B/R was accepting applications for writers. After penning an \u201caudition\u201d slideshow on something related to the current state of the Broncos, I was accepted as a low-level writer and allowed to publish pieces. To say I was excited is an understatement, and while I had no idea at the time, this role would end up shaping my college and professional career.\nPerhaps one reason I feel so attached to Bleacher Report is because we have grown together. When I started writing nearly three years ago, B/R was an independent site that few of my friends had heard of and I was a 19-year-old learning how to write a solid headline.\nBleacher Report is now a part of Turner Sports. It\u2019s the sports outlet for CNN, and I rarely run into anyone who hasn\u2019t at least heard of it. And while I\u2019m not ready to declare myself Writer of the Year, my ability and confidence as a writer are also a long way from where they were three years ago.\nI got more and more involved with Bleacher Report. During the summer of 2011, I participated in the B/R Writing Internship, which I cannot speak highly enough of. It\u2019s undergone some changes and is now the Advanced Program in Sports Media.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed is that in addition to helping you find your voice as a writer through vigorous and assorted assignments, the program gives aspiring writers the chance to form relationships with Bleacher Report writers and staff members from across the country. As these professional relationships turn to friendships, more opportunities come from them.\nFor me, one of these opportunities was being hired as a Moderator on the Community team, where I currently work, in addition to being a Denver Broncos Featured Columnist.\nI sometimes miss the days when Bleacher Report was just an up-and-coming site and I was just a college sophomore, creating slideshows from the couch in my apartment.\nAs quickly as life moves, though, the world of sports journalism is moving just as quickly. Anyone who doesn\u2019t want to keep up will be left behind, so it\u2019s crucial for new writers to ask themselves where they want to be in the future, and more importantly, how they will get there.\nMany of my friends questioned me in college when I would spend countless hours writing for an unknown website for no pay; many of those same friends now envy me for my occupation. Whether sports journalism turns out to be my career or a stopover en route to my final destination, I will always know that without it, my foundation as a writer would have been incomplete.\nAnd as we all know, a building without a strong foundation never stands for very long.\nJoe Rapolla Jr. is a Comment Moderator on the Bleacher Report Community team.

They are capable of growing over 100 feet in height. Oaks are suitable for use in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 to 10. Species such as the red and white oak, for example, are featured in some landscapes. Incorporating flowering plants beneath oak trees requires planning so both the tree and flowers remain healthy.\nSelect flowering plants that are shade loving to plant beneath oak trees. Consider California mountain lilacs (Ceanothus), hummingbird sage (Salvia spathacea) or alum root (Heuchera maxima) as examples of shade-loving flowering plants. Choose plants that will not grow to a height that will interfere with the lower branches of the oak tree.\nSelect a location for planting under the oak tree that is near the drip line or at least 10 feet from the trunk of the tree. The drip line is the circumference around the tree that is equal to the distance from the trunk out to the tips of the branches.\nDig a hole that is the same depth and twice the size of the flowering plant's root ball. Place the removed dirt on a tarp or in a wheelbarrow to save for replacing. Keep in mind that oak tree roots typically grow between 10 and 12 inches deep below the surface.\nPlace the root ball of the plant in the hole. Fill the hole around the root ball with the dirt that was removed earlier and tamp lightly to remove air pockets.\nAdd a layer of mulch around the plants to help hold moisture, but do not allow the mulch to contact the stem of the new plant. The soil beneath an oak tree can be dry, as the tree requires large amounts of moisture for survival. Water the plants as necessary to keep the soil moist, and supplement rainfall when needed.\nTry to avoid selecting plants with root balls that will require holes deeper than 10 inches. Otherwise, try to limit the number of larger plants so that there is less chance of disturbing the oak tree roots.\nChoose fertilizer carefully and apply only when needed. Select a balanced fertilizer that is close to 3-1-2 if necessary. Healthy oaks do not typically require fertilization, and fertilizer can be detrimental to unhealthy oaks.\nShore, Tara. \"How to Get Flowers to Grow Under Oak Trees.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/flowers-grow-under-oak-trees-46088.html.

Edison had already invented a durable electric light bulb when he and other technical pioneers established the first electrical utility in New York in 1882. Railroad magnate Henry Villard, who had brought the Northern Pacific\u2019s rails to Spokane that same year, was an enthusiastic backer of the electric light bulb and had Edison install generators and lights on his personal yacht, The Columbia. According to legend, one of Villard\u2019s generators was brought to Spokane in 1885 and became the first of its kind here, set up in the basement of a flourmill by George A. Fitch. The newfangled \u201carc dynamo\u201d only powered a string of 10 streetlights in the downtown area, but it was a start. Other groups quickly formed, including The Spokane Falls Light and Power Company and the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Spokane Falls. All the early generators were built near flumes where a wheel could be placed in swift water to provide power, but sometimes the water level dropped, or rose and flooded out the power plant. But the developers and investors in the new technology could see that a larger, more permanent installation was needed. F. Rockwood Moore and a group of investors formed Washington Water Power Company in March of 1889 to develop the lower falls and avoid the 30 percent royalty fee that the Edison company was giving to the inventor. Just five months later, a stray spark started the massive 1889 fire that destroyed the downtown area. But by the next night, electric lights lit the rubble of the fire thanks electricity traveling down baling and barbed wire strung on anything that would hold it. In November of 1890, the large WWP powerhouse below the Monroe St. Bridge switched on, signaling the end for smaller independent generation plants. WWP bought out the Edison Company in 1891 and began buying streetcar lines. In 1895, the company bought Twickenham Park on the west side of town and changed the name to Natatorium Park. For several decades it was a popular ball field, amusement park and social meeting spot. By 1899, virtually all the generating companies and most of the streetcar lines were consolidated under the WWP Company.

Furthermore, questions linger over whether Uber was acting in the best interest of its users or whether it was mostly concerned about its own image when it paid the hackers to delete the stolen data.\nThe stolen data, which included email addresses, phone numbers, and driver\u2019s license numbers, was discovered by hackers on an Amazon server, which they accessed using credentials lifted from a private GitHub site used by Uber software engineers. Although it could be argued that handing over $100,000 to hackers is a small price to pay\u2014the so called \u201ccost of doing business\u201d\u2014there doesn\u2019t seem to be any conceivable way that Uber could\u2019ve ensured that the hackers actually deleted the data after receiving their hush money.\nBoth Joe Sullivan, Uber\u2019s chief security officer, and Craig Clark, a lawyer who reported to him, were fired because of the incident. On Thursday it was reported that Uber\u2019s new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over for Travis Kalanick following a string of scandals, became aware of the breach two weeks after becoming CEO. However, Uber waited for an additional two months to disclose the incident.\nNow, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are pressuring Uber to reveal further details behind the \u201ctroubling\u201d reports of how the company handled the hack.\nMost states have specific laws in place for handling data breaches on this scale, which includes a patchwork of notification requirements. In some states, public notification is required within 30 days of when the company learns of the breach and may even require the company to notify the media when a considerable number of consumers are impacted. In California, for example, a company involved in a major breach is required to \u201cconspicuously\u201d post information about the breach on its website.\nAccording to reports, Uber\u2019s systems were breached after the attackers discovered log-in credentials to an AWS account used to handle payments.

Kilbourn Ave, at a celebration Monday evening. Saint Kate The Arts Hotel, which is the venue's full name, is slated to open in mid-2019.\nWhile there are many art-themed hotels and hotel chains in the U.S., including 21c Museum Hotels and Ace Hotels, Marcus Hotels & Resorts is promising the Milwaukee property will be unlike any other. In addition to art-inspired guest rooms, the hotel will feature a gallery, an artist-in-residence studio and a theater space for performances, screenings, talks and workshops. The hotel will soon hire a curator and director of performance to manage the art programs.\n\"Arts are one of our crown jewels in Milwaukee \u2014 and it's an economic driver,\" said Greg Marcus, president and CEO of The Marcus Corp. \"We can support our arts, and support our artistic community, and raise the questions and do all of those important things and still have it be financially successful for the artists, for us, for everybody.\"\nTo expand on the plans made so far, the hotel is also throwing the door wide for any kind of idea from any kind of artist from anywhere in the world that could become part of the hotel experience. Proposed projects will be initially judged by an independent advisory group of Milwaukee-area arts leaders, and there is no deadline. The invitation is ongoing. Ideas can be sent to proposals@saintkatearts.com.\nMarcus said the hotel's goal is to be a place where creatives connect, to be a hub for the art-minded in Milwaukee, and \"to challenge people\u2019s thinking about art and the creative process,\" too.\nThere are two, in-the-works model rooms on the fourth floor of the hotel. Sheets of white foam board hang on the walls, holding places for the art to come, and the work of local artists can be found in the details. If you open the closets, a black-and-white painting of trees by Todd Mrozinski has been reproduced inside; Kohler Co. sinks featuring designs by local artists such as Daniel Chung are installed in the bathrooms; lampshades feature word-based designs from Bay View Printing; and a throw with a design by Christiane Grauert will be placed at the foot of every bed.\nThe branding for the hotel \u2014 featuring a deep orange oval \u2014 was also unveiled Monday, as was a website, SaintKateArts.com. The hotel's name isn't a serious religious reference, but an informal nod to the names of august, luxury hotels like the St. Regis, Marcus added.\nSaint Kate will be within walking distance to downtown arts and entertainment venues, including the Pabst Theater, the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Fiserv Forum and art galleries in the Third Ward.\nThe Marcus Corp., which owns or manages 21 other hotels and properties in the U.S., also owns The Pfister hotel, known for its Victorian art collection and"}

{"idx": "14158", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It might sound a little crazy, but open enrollment is right around the corner -- and now is the perfect time to start preparing. The fact of the matter is, most employers review their benefits only once a year. A 2016 Society for Human Resource Management report found that 77 percent of 2,937 HR professionals surveyed said they performed a benefits program review on an annual basis only.\nSo, it&apos;s optimal to get ready now. For one thing, it\u2019s better to get ready sooner so there\u2019s more time to explore more options and really perfect plans. But why else should companies have open enrollment on the brain?\nAre Better Benefits the Solution to the Employee Wellness Problem?\n1. Thanks to the ACA, It\u2019s time for a new enrollment strategy.\nOne of the main stressors of crafting a new open enrollment strategy this year is the Affordable Care Act: 2016 will be the first time organizations have reporting requirements under the new act. Employers now must file annual information returns with the IRS and furnish statements to employees on healthcare-plan coverage information.\nTo ensure a simple reporting process, strategize and implement a system of best practices so the company complies with all necessary reports. The process should involve identifying all employees who fall under the ACA definition of \"full-time,\" which may include some special classifications, like contractors or short-term temps. Assess the best way to repeat employee classifications moving forward, to ensure the company is complying with the employer shared-responsibility provisions.\nAfter determining employee status, update summary plan descriptions (SPDs) to keep employees informed of their rights and obligations. SPDs are automatically given to participants because plan administrators are legally obligated to provide them. Work closely with your HR software partner and benefits brokers to ease some of the burden of successfully reporting to the IRS. You\u2019ll avoid harsh penalties that way, too.\n2. Consider offering new benefits early on.\nOnce you&apos;ve properly dealt with the ACA, your new enrollment plan will also need to address any potential changes to benefits plans in order to really gear to what employees want most. Would employees be interested in popular new options? Health savings accounts (HSAs) and consumer directed health plans (CDHPs) are both on the rise. The 2016 report from SHRM found that the percentage of organizations offering HSAs increased from 43 percent to 50 percent over the past year.\nMercer\u2019s 2014 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, which polled 2,569 employers, resulted in several key findings as well. Offerings of CDHPs jumped from 39 percent to 48 percent among employers with 500 or more employees.\nThe SHRM report also found that many of the employers surveyed were trying to encourage participation in retirement plans. One out of five organizations were automatically enrolling current employees who were not participating in their retirement savings plan; and that gave them the option of actively opting out.\nAuto-enrollment, however, is an effective method for engaging employees in their benefits. It encourages them to look at the contribution plan and consider what best fits their needs.\nWere similar plans offered last year? If so, how interested were employees? What were they prone to choose? Use this information to predict the success of other benefits, like wellness plans.

{"idx": "14168", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, are a very cool innovation. They allow you to remain anonymous online and bypass restrictions imposed by media giants to let you access an unimaginable amount of content and this is just the tip of the iceberg. The truth is that VPNs are a tool with the power to do incredible things, however, not a lot of people really understand the details about their functioning.\nIf you\u2019re a common VPN user, then you must be familiar with the term \u2018encryption\u2019. But do you really know what it means in terms of computer systems? The answer to this is not very short, but we\u2019re more than pleased to illustrate this process so that everyone can get the most out of it and really understand what\u2019s going on when they hit the connect button on their VPN clients.\nSimply put, encryption is a process in which you rearrange and modify the contents of your data so that it becomes unreadable by anyone who is not allowed to its access. The digital encryption used by VPNs depends on something called a \u201ckey\u201d (sometimes many of them) that tells the user\u2019s computer how to modify the data so that the VPN server can understand it and decrypt it later. Most modern VPNs use symmetric encryption algorithms, which rely on a single key to encrypt and decrypt as opposed to asymmetric encryption which requires a different one for each action.\nEncrypted data is then transmitted through the network making use of protocols. These contain instructions for the computers involved about how to handle, encrypt and divide the data to be sent as well as some other more specific directives regarding the keys and other metadata. The best protocols ensure your data is as well-protected as possible and that all your communications are as fast as you require them to be. There are many VPN protocols and encryption schemes in existence, so let\u2019s discuss some of them to know which ones are best.\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about ciphers. These represent the specific method in which your data is encrypted. Each variant as its benefits and downsides. The key things you have to look for are robustness, known weaknesses and speed. The most common encryption algorithms these days are the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and another one commonly known as Blowfish. Security adepts agree that AES is currently the most secure option, which is made evident by the fact that almost all VPN providers use it.\nWhen it comes to protocols, there exist a few more commonly known options but, in the end, it all comes down to a showdown between IPSEC (also known as L2TP), SSTP and OpenVPN. The first one is strong enough to be trusted by the majority of the experts in the area, however, it is far slower at its job than its peers. The second one, SSTP, is also very strong, but it is only available for Windows PCs, which makes it inviable for mobile VPNs.\nNow the real deal starts with OpenVPN. This protocol is as secure as IPSEC and much faster at the same time. It is open source, meaning it\u2019s got a big community behind it constantly trying to improve it and make it faster and safer for everyone. This is the most recommended protocol, although not all VPN providers support it. I recommend you use the availability of OpenVPN as a critical factor to consider when deciding which VPN provider to hire.\nMaking your online traffic unreadable saves you from many risks that lurk out there. Governmental agencies, hackers, big companies, these all have one thing in common: they are constantly gathering data about your online habits. By encrypting it, you can prevent it from being sold"}

But home it was to us, the five or six women who lived there, over the years.\nWhen we set up house, we arranged that we\u2019d eat dinners together. We rotated cooking responsibilities every night, and we shared grocery costs. We shared a common Christian faith, and also a common prayer life. We all seemed to collect friends and often we found unplanned guests at our dinner table. Some would graduate or move on and others would find a place in our home.\nSeveral of us remained in this arrangement for ten years, and those who left stayed connected anyway through letters, e-mails, postcards, photos, and visits. We celebrated each other\u2019s graduations and engagements with parties, and nursed each other through failures and break-ups at Gertie\u2019s ice cream parlor. We helped plan each other\u2019s weddings and traveled as far as Buffalo and Vermont (though we failed to travel as far as Kazakhstan and Albania) to be there for them. But I get ahead of myself. Somehow over the years we became a family, a sisterhood, a nest, a refuge for one another.\nFor me it was also a school. I gaped in astonishment at the domestic savvy of my roommates back when I first met them. All of them seemed somehow to be privy to mysterious knowledge. They knew how to make soup. They knew how to mop floors. They practiced something called spring cleaning. They had actual opinions, which implied actual knowledge, about cleaning products and homemade cleaning solutions. They could even make bread. These young women struck me as just this side of magical. How had I missed all this, I wondered?\nI came to graduate school the year prior fresh from a grilled-cheese-off with my little brother back in Arizona. He boasted of his, I boasted of mine, though it was an entirely empty boast, and soon we found ourselves in the kitchen, setting up a contest\u2014an extremely typical outcome to conversations among us siblings (the contest, not the kitchen).

They have to hire an architect to prepare the report, list the work, bid that all out, then get the money. Our approach was to be understanding of that and be available to answer questions,\u201d she said.\nIn 2004, Chicago\u2019s older commercial high-rises were given 12 years to install sprinklers.

The relatives wanted a sweeping sprinkler mandate with no exceptions and fewer delays.\nIn December 2011, Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) joined North Side Ald. Tom Tunney (44th) in co-sponsoring an ordinance that gave building owners three more years to make the improvements. At the time, they argued that struggling owners were having trouble footing the bill.\nTwo years later, Hairston said she had \u201cno second thoughts\u201d about spearheading the delay \u2014 not even after two people died in a fire at a 16-story building at 6730 S. South Shore Drive that was not equipped with a sprinkler system, hard-wired alarm or communications system to disable elevators and alert condominium owners.\nTunney had faced similar questions one year earlier after a 32-year-old woman died in a high-rise fire at 3130 N.

Prior to today\u2019s decision, JCP&L\u2019s rates had not been fully reviewed for almost a decade. And while we are disappointed that rates are not being lowered more, a rate cut is certainly better than a rate increase.\nThis decision vindicates the efforts of AARP and others, led by the Division of Rate Counsel, who petitioned the Board to require JCP&L open its books on evidence it was overcharging ratepayers and who persevered through a complex and lengthy process to ensure that JCP&L customers are only paying rates that are fair and reasonable. Today\u2019s BPU decision affirms that the company was indeed overcharging its customers.\nThe $115 million base rate reduction is offset in part by today\u2019s additional BPU decision to allow the company to begin recovering, in its rates, the Superstorm Sandy-related storm costs it reasonably incurred. Deciding both of these issues today allows for the recovery of these extraordinary costs from ratepayers without increasing their bills. In fact JCP&L revenues will be CUT by $35 million annually.\nAARP is pleased that JCP&L will also be required to file another base rate case by April 2017 to ensure that the company\u2019s books are reviewed in a timely manner and that future rates are fair and reasonable."}

Adventure, based on the Who Was\u2026? series of books from Grosset & Dunlap. Who Was? Adventure features over 4,500 trivia questions for both young players and adults, challenging their knowledge of famous historical figures.\nThe game\u2019s questions have been developed using content from the books, and are arranged in 85 levels in an adventure mode. During each game, players must answer questions about figures past and present, ranging from King Tut and Julius Caesar to George Lucas and Abraham Lincoln. Players are presented with statements about these famous faces, and must tap on the appropriate person as their pictures fall from the top of the screen.\nPlayers are shown the name of each individual for the first few seconds they\u2019re on screen, so they aren\u2019t required to identify figures by their faces only. While each level has one historical figure as its base, the majority of questions vary greatly in theme and in their position on the overall historical timeline.\nAt the start of each level, players are presented with a few appropriate facts and a timeline from the Who Was\u2026? books to help them play. As players answer questions, they earn power-ups. A bullseye, for instance, can instantly answer a question correctly.\nOutside of adventure mode, a separate arcade mode allows gamers to challenge others in endless trivia battles. Here, users work to beat their friends\u2019 high scores. An achievements system rounds out the game, as users are given rewards for completing specific tasks, like answering every question correctly in a single round, for example.\nAs a premium game, the title doesn\u2019t offer in-app purchases or ads.

He simply figured Mondesi has been the Yankees\u2019 right fielder all year long and opted to play him over the lefty-swinging Karim Garcia against hittable right-hander John Wasdin.\nMondesi relaxed enough to draw a bases-loaded walk that snapped a tie in the seventh inning and help the Yankees to an 8-5 victory in front of a SkyDome crowd of 27,652.\nThe victory went to Andy Pettitte, who was anything but sharp in a season-high 123-pitch effort. Pettitte, who improved to 11-6 with his sixth straight victory, couldn\u2019t hold a 5-1 lead in the second, giving up solo runs in the second, third, four and sixth. He gave up five runs and nine hits in seven frames.\nThe victory enabled the Yankees to remain two games ahead of the Red Sox in the American League East.\nJason Giambi went 2-for-5 and swatted his 24th homer in the eighth that upped the Yankees\u2019 lead to 8-5.

When his first three pitches to Eric Hinske were out of the strike zone, Torre replaced Miceli with Mariano Rivera.\nHe completed the walk to Hinske but induced Orlando Hudson to hit into a 5-3 double play and allow the Yankees to breathe easier. However, that didn\u2019t last long since Rivera rolled his right ankle fielding pinch-hitter Howie Clark\u2019s grounder for the final out.\nRivera did work the ninth for his 16th save.\nThursday night Torre indicated strongly that Garcia would play right field at least through tomorrow.

Its new home is on vacant, private land along the waterfront at the intersection of First Avenue and Pennsylvania Street.\nThe Sturgeon Bay City Council unanimously approved Tuesday the street closures necessary to move the 68-foot tall structure from its west side site near the Maple-Oregon Bridge. The application for the move includes closing nearby streets and the bridge to all traffic and pedestrians during a 3 a.m. to 6 p.m. time frame.\nThe granary is moving largely intact, with only the bottom third of the structure removed, said Christie Weber, president of the Sturgeon Bay Historical Society.\nThe estimated time to move the granary is several hours but the time was extended to address any problems that arise and to ensure all boat traffic is aware that the bridge will not open March 29 until 6 p.m., said Pat Drury, owner of Drury Design, Inc., who is the contractor for the move of the granary.\nThe road closures will be incremental as the granary is moved from the west to the east side of the Maple-Oregon Bridge.\nAfter the granary is moved to the west side entrance of the Maple-Oregon Bridge, the previously closed section of Maple Avenue and the intersection will open by 6 a.m. for the morning traffic, he said.\nAs the granary reaches the east-side foot of the bridge, Oregon Street and First Avenue near the bridge will close while the structure is moved to the new location.\n\"I am so thrilled that all of this came together like this,\" Weber said. \"This shows the tremendous heart our community has.\"\nDrury Design has been the contractor for renovations of multiple historic buildings in the Green Bay region.\n\"The only way to save the granary was this way \u2014 finding a new site and moving it there,\" Drury said. \"If they had taken the granary apart, they never would have been able to put it back together.\"\nThe crib construction inside the granary includes wood that has been interwoven, which created a very solid and stable structure, Drury said.\n\"No one could have put this back together,\" he said. \"I am very happy to be a part of this (project) to save the granary.\"\nAfter the city's fire chief ordered the granary razed in October to protect the public safety, the City Council voted to remove the structure and store it for a year while the city developed a plan for the building.

The model includes a proposal to divert a share of the profits into local community projects and into helping other communities develop their own renewable energy schemes.\nThe proposed Trust is a direct response to the findings of The Scope for Renewable Energy in Cumbria, written by former Government energy adviser and environmental scientist Sir Martin Holdgate on behalf of Cumbria Vision's Renewable Energy Panel. The study identifies the economic opportunities arising from renewable energy development in the County and identifies smaller-scale renewable technologies as a key contributor towards Cumbria\u2019s renewable energy output.\nThe details of the Trust and how it would function will be developed in detail if there is strong enough support from the public. It is anticipated that the initial level of investment would be restricted to a minimum of \u00a3500 and a maximum of \u00a32,500 per resident \u2013 a successful model already proved by Energy4All\u2019s 1996 Baywind project in Ulverston.\nTherefore if just 1,000 of Cumbria\u2019s 497,000 residents invested, the Trust could easily raise \u00a31.5-2.5million in shares.\nKeeping investments small but many will also mean profits are more evenly distributed throughout communities. Investors will be made aware of the differing returns from renewable sources, which range from 1 per cent to 15 per cent per annum. The Trust would also offer help to communities and other organisations wanting to develop their own projects independently.\nTo keep administrative and legal costs to a minimum and to harness skills and experience in the renewable energy field, discussions are underway to see if an existing Cumbrian social enterprise, charity or local authority is willing to \u201chost\u201d the Trust.\nThe questionnaire is available to download under the Renewable Energy section at www.cumbriavision.co.uk. The deadline for responses is March 31, 2010. A decision will be made on whether to pursue the creation of a Trust depending on feedback."}

Well, it\u2019s something that is incredibly \u2014 it\u2019s remarkable. It\u2019s something that none of us expected, if you would have asked us a month ago. Certainly, the reasons are long in the coming. This is a regime that has been authoritarian from the very beginning, even before President Mubarak. It\u2019s a regime that has tried to use the institutions of democracy in a facade-like manner to sell itself as a democracy to the West, but, of course, it\u2019s nothing close to that.\nThere are also economic reasons that are underpinning these protests. As you know, 20 percent of Egyptians live below poverty, and another 20 percent of Egyptians live close to the poverty line. Inflation has been very high over the last number of years. Income inequality, according to the World Bank and the IMF, has increased, as well.\nAnd President Mubarak, I think it should not be mistaken, is a dictator. He is a dictator. And what people are calling for is not just a change in the ministers or a new minister of finance, but a different regime. They want Mubarak to leave. And I think it would also not be acceptable, for all of the people on the streets, if the newly appointed vice president were simply to take over. He is also part of the regime. And what they\u2019re calling for is a fundamentally different type of politics. And I think that tomorrow, with the calls that we\u2019ve heard today for a national day of protest, a million-person march tomorrow, hopefully, hopefully, this regime will come to an end.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about how economics \u2014 you\u2019re a specialist in labor in Egypt.

Before going to sleep, he read the comic book as a guilty pleasure.\nCampbell-Staton became curious about other comic book universes, and returned to buy a couple of other superhero comics, which he also read before falling asleep. He started to have strange dreams that combined the biology he was thinking about with the comic books he was reading. He had a dream about the Flash \u2013 the fastest person in the world whose super speed is coupled with superhuman reflexes \u2013 running faster than a bullet. Campbell-Staton woke up thinking about muscle fiber, friction and metabolism \u2014 things that fuel a body.\nCampbell-Staton started his popular Biology of Superheroes podcast in late 2017, which was a top 20 iTunes science and medicine podcast this January.\nThis quarter he is teaching a new \u201cBiology of Superheroes\u201d course for juniors and seniors in the life sciences. He uses superheroes such as Batman, Captain America, Black Panther and Wonder Woman, as well as Jurassic Park and zombies, to teach his students the biology of aging, genetics, evolution, genetic engineering, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, the ethics of reviving extinct species, parallel universes, intelligent alien life and how biology shapes modern society.\nShane Campbell-Staton teaches his \u201cBiology of Superheroes\u201d course at UCLA.\nStudents read peer-reviewed research journal articles, chapters from science books and comic books. They can create their own science fiction or superhero podcast for their final project, or write a paper or a superhero short novel. Campbell-Staton said he would like to include some of their podcast material on his podcast.\nCampbell-Staton said he wants to push students to think about biology in ways they typically would not.\n\u201cUsually, we learn the biology of plants and animals. This class is refreshing and cool,\u201d Fayt Sarreal said.\nStudent Andy Duong said Campbell-Staton cleverly weaves science into the superhero discussions in a creative and engaging way.\nIn a recent class session, Campbell-Staton raised a question posed by Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould (who died in 2002): If you replay the tape of evolution, will you repeatedly get the same results or different results?\nThe consensus among the students was the results would be different. One said the six-mile-wide asteroid that crashed to Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs and approximately 75 percent of the world\u2019s animal and plant species, might miss the Earth in an alternate scenario, and if so, the dinosaurs likely would still roam the Earth.\nThe 2018 movie, \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d addresses this question with alternate universes. The character Peter Parker is Spider-Man in one universe, while Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman in another universe. The same characters appear in different universes, but as a superhero in one universe,"}

Now, he is taking recycled tile to the next level, and the proof is in the porcelain.\nOn Oct. 15, trucks from San Jose\u2019s Zanker Road landfill will deliver 150 tons of porcelain to Fireclay\u2019s factory in Aromas, outside of Watsonville. The porcelain, which came in the form of sinks, toilets and bathtubs, will be crushed to dust and transformed into tiles.\nIt took 12 months to collect the 15 debris containers of porcelain, and it comes on the heels of a similar shipment from a San Francisco transfer station near Candlestick Point.\nThe porcelain will be mixed with other materials and scorched in an 1,800-degree kiln to create the company\u2019s Debris Series Tile. The new tile will have 70 percent recycled materials and probably be the only tile in the industry made from post-consumer waste.\nBurns is pleased, but it\u2019s been a lot of work.\nBurns sat on the shaded tile patio of his shop at 495 W.

On his own, President Trump has made dramatic and positive executive orders, but his legislative agenda has been disappointing due to the powerful forces arrayed against him.\nTheoretically, the President should have been able to achieve all of his goals because the Republicans control all branches of government. Unfortunately, the inept congressional leadership has not produced any major victories for the President or his 63 million supporters.\nIn essence, the \u201cswamp\u201d has not been drained but the \u201cswamp creatures\u201d are trying to drown the populist, nationalist agenda of President Trump. Clearly, the GOP needs more change agents in Congress. Republicans have too many moderate and establishment members who like \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d Thus, the President\u2019s call to repeal and replace Obamacare, cut taxes, build a border wall and provide Americans with improved infrastructure is not being heeded. With the clock ticking toward the mid-term elections, the time is running out for the President\u2019s agenda to be implemented.\nNext Tuesday in Alabama, Republican voters will have an outstanding opportunity to provide the President with some crucial assistance. There is an election to replace the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in February. The interim Senator, Luther Strange, is facing former State Supreme Court Chief Judge Roy Moore in the GOP run-off.\nThe Republican Party establishment wing desperately wants Strange to win this election. The poster child for the establishment Republicans is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has been in the U.S. Senate for almost 33 years. It is no surprise that McConnell is strongly supporting Strange in his race against Moore, who is a bona fide conservative leader with a strong history of leading the fight in the courts for traditional values.\nMcConnell\u2019s political action committee is pumping big money into Alabama to help Strange. Most importantly, Strange is going to get a big boost today by a visit from President Trump to Huntsville, AL. The President has been tweeting messages of support for \u201cBig Luther,\u201d and will lead today\u2019s rally on his behalf.\nCuriously, Strange is a former lobbyist who supported CAFTA, a trade deal that shipped thousands of Alabama jobs to Central America. In contrast, President Trump campaigned vigorously on a platform of ending unfair trade deals.\nUnlike Strange, Judge Moore is an ardent conservative who fought against gay marriage and supported the Ten Commandments while on the Alabama Supreme Court. He is being supported by many of the President\u2019s most vocal supporters, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former White House official Sebastian Gorka.\nThis runoff election pits an establishment \u201cswamp creature\u201d McConnell and his establishment colleagues against the true conservative reformers who supported President Trump in the 2016 election. Evidently, the President is supporting Strange to bolster the standing of McConnell before the key Senate votes on tax reform and repealing Obamacare.\nStrange may be supporting the President\u2019s agenda currently, but his allegiance is really with McConnell. He initially sent a letter supporting McConnell\u2019s position to keep the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

It's been on the Market since Spring of 2009, and has been through too many updates to count in that time. The good news is that it's paid off.\nBetter Keyboard replaces your native on-screen Android keyboard, but it offers some great enhancements. The first thing you'll notice is speed and accuracy. At this writing, Android's native keyboard still does not support multitouch. Better Keyboard does (in Android 2.0 and higher), and that gives you a real speed boost. You don't have to lift one thumb off the screen before your other thumb touches the next key. It's noticeable, and it's great.\nBetter Keyboard's accuracy has grown by leaps and bounds, too. It definitely seems like I hit the key I want much more consistently than with the native keyboard. The keys seem bigger, somehow, and easier to hit. Better Keyboard's auto-correct is very good, too. It regularly knows what word you want even when you're only half-done typing it. In the newest updates, it's also easier than ever to add words to the dictionary.\nOther speed enhancements: You can swipe left to right to switch to the symbols screen. Swipe right to left, and it changes to a compact qwerty (think BlackBerry Pearl). The compact qwerty isn't my favorite thing, but some folks like it, and I'm sure they'll be glad to see it. You can also long-press on a key and get the symbol behind it. Very nice. And, thankfully, it has a speech input key (Android 2.1 and above) that really saves time.\nIf I sound surprised, it's because this keyboard was once abysmal. It was slow and inaccurate, the auto-correct was bad, and the keyboard crashed all the time. The developers have clearly been hard at work, though, and it now works incredibly well. Another nice feature is that you can choose from literally hundreds of skins to download (mostly for free) from the market to customize how Better Keyboard looks. Been dying for a keyboard with your favorite sports team's colors? Someone has almost certainly made one already.\nThis is a very good keyboard and is certainly well ahead of Android's native keyboard. For two-thumb typing in landscape mode, it's the best. That said, when you type with one thumb in portrait mode, sliding keyboards like Swype or SlideIT seem a lot faster to me, even if they are less accurate. In a perfect world, I'd like to be able to use Better Keyboard when in landscape, and SlideIT or Swype when in portrait.

Mitt Romney's third quarter financial audit has yet to be posted at the FEC's website, but while we wait, you can read over this internal memo written by the campaign's legal and strategy teams and distributed to campaign higher ups last week.\nMy quick summary: We're raising a lot; Mitt is giving a lot; We're spending a lot; We're winning where we need to be winning; Rudy's in trouble because he can't write himself a check and has to spend to keep pace.\nIn the memo, Romney's advisers predict that Ex-Sen. Fred Thompson and Sen. John McCain will have be forced to opt in to the federal primary financing system in order to compete with Romney. And the memo claims that Giuliani \"is in danger\" of confronting that choice, given the campaign's rate of spending and slowing rate of receipts. (Giuliani advisers dismiss this out of hand).\n\"Investment\" is used as a euphasmism for \"burn rate\" here -- the campaign claims that Romney's blistering 85% burn rate since the beginning of the year has paid dividends in the form of solid leads in the early polls, while Giuliani has spent furiously and managed only to maintain his lead in non-early states.\n[It] continues to be of great benefit to the campaign in this most challenging of fundraising environments for Republicans. His ability to do so should not be understated when the ultimate goal is not \"winning\" one quarter's fundraising race, but rather beating the Democrats in November 2008. The ads he helped finance have moved Governor Romney \u2013 who began this campaign much less well-known than his primary opponents \u2013 competitive in every key early state and in an excellent position to capture the nomination.\nYou can read the full memo after the jump.\nROMNEY F O R PRESIDENT, I N C .\nAs the dust settles over the Third Quarter fundraising totals, Governor Romney's chances of being the GOP nominee are excellent. We admit to being pleasantly surprised at our numbers compared to our opponents', and note that Governor Romney's totals far outpace his standing in the national polls that so obsess the media.\nFirst, based on this week's announcement, Mayor Giuliani's fundraising is slipping. In fact, it has fallen considerably since the second quarter when he reported $17 million in total receipts. According to published reports yesterday, the Mayor's primary cash total for the third quarter fundraising period will only be about $500,000 more than Governor Romney's. This number indicates a notable decline in Mayor Giuliani's fundraising success, despite his extensive fundraising effort this quarter. The Mayor's campaign held well over 100 publicly reported fundraisers since the end of the second quarter, including widely-publicized events in London and Kazakhstan. The surprising total for a world-wide fundraising effort is further amplified by the Giuliani campaign's decision not to compete in the Iowa Republican Straw Poll. Giuliani's absence from Iowa freed up critical time and resources that should have given him a considerable advantage in fundraising and cash on hand. It is a clear victory for us that we are expected to report $10 million for the third quarter and yet, still handily won the Iowa Republican Straw Poll.\nSecond, we see very encouraging signs in the cash on hand totals. Mayor Giuliani's cash on hand continues to fall. When all the numbers are calculated, it"}

Yet less than 1 percent of the 30,000 vehicles owned by the state are electric vehicles.\nOnly four of 31 local government entities surveyed by Coltura, a Seattle-based non-profit, have plans to switch to electric cars.\nThe organization issued a report titled \"Recharge Required,\" [PDF] supported by Plug-in America and four other environmental groups that calls for state and municipal agencies to buy electric cars first, and requires justification for any non-electric vehicle purchases.\nThe report notes that a wide variety of electric vehicles are available that can serve municipal and government needs, including buses, trucks, and long-range electric cars, such as the Chevy Bolt EV, and that they are cheaper to operate than gasoline cars, which can save the agencies money over the lifespan of the vehicles.\nColtura found that few fleet managers and state leaders are even aware of the law and that the state Department of Commerce has not enforced legally mandated reporting on the progress toward buying electric vehicles.\n\u201cWhile we often hear from our state and local leaders about the perils of climate change and the need to take action, this report reveals a shocking disregard for an existing state law requiring public entities to phase out the use of gasoline and diesel to power public vehicles,\u201d said Matthew Metz, founder and co-executive director of Coltura. The organization says it is working to achieve a gasoline-free America by 2040.\nSeattle owns the most electric cars of the Washington cities that Coltura surveyed, with 178 electric vehicles, out of a fleet of 3,410. Several of the cities Coltura surveyed have none.\nColtura calls for the state to adopt an \"EV First\" policy requiring purchases of electric vehicles \"unless there is a demonstrated and urgent need to purchase gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles.\" The organization's report also calls for expanding grant and loan programs to public agencies to help expand charging infrastructure and pay additional up-front costs for electric vehicles, for expanding training regarding the law and electric cars, and giving the Commerce department additional authority and resources to enforce the law.\nAt the same time, Washington State legislators failed to renew a law that exempted purchases of electric cars up to $42,500. The state had issued 7,500 such tax exemptions over two years, but the program ran out of money. Several bills to renew it didn't pass.\nCalifornia and neighboring Oregon have become primary markets for electric cars in the United States with required sales targets.

This is about $4 a barrel higher than at the end of March.\nAnalysts say that the market is reacting to an inflow of European and west African crude oil into the US market. Some traders and analysts had been expecting a downward correction in prices because April-June is usually when oil demand is at its lowest.\nA fall in refining margins has caused a slowdown of refinery output. This has also helped undermine crude oil demand, analysts say.\nEuropean oil refiners are reducing the amount of crude they process by an estimated 10 per cent because of a shortage of Middle East crudes and reduced margins on prices.\nIncreasing amounts of Middle East crudes are going to fuel booming Asian economies, say analysts. Asia is estimated to consume about 25 per cent of world oil production compared with about 16-17 per cent 10 years ago, they say.\nMuch of the extra demand is met by Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Iran, and the discounts offered to European refiners have dropped. \u2018There is such a good Far East market that Middle East producers may be turning their back on us,\u2019 one analyst says.

That sounds strange: Freiman is the tallest position player in big-league history. Henderson was known for one of the lowest crouches in the game.\nBut the idea paid off.

For Perry, co-owner of Datz, it was about moving to a new town and, after too much time floating in a pool, dreaming up something to do.\nThe women were guest speakers at a recent Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce women's series luncheon titled \"La cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me: How women are rising to the top of the food industry.'' To hear them tell it, owning a food business is hard work, risky but a lot of fun.\nSchalk recalled not having a business plan or \"a clue'' when she and her husband, Jim, started Toffee To Go as a retail operation in 2002. Today, the couple has outgrown their store and production facility on Bay to Bay Boulevard and next year plans to expand. In the meantime, Toffee To Go plans to ship up to 5,000 packages a day in December when, combined with November, the company does 85 percent of its business.\nPerry said she and her husband, Roger, have learned lessons the hard way since opening Datz in 2009 along MacDill Avenue. At the top of her list? Never open a restaurant in a place that doesn't have two times the parking you think you need. And always expect to pay more for things than planned.\nOut of the parking problem, however, grew the Perrys latest venture, Kalupa's bakery next door, which they renamed Dough. \"I didn't want a bakery, but I needed the parking to survive at Datz,'' she said.\nPierola, owner and chef at Edison Food + Drink Lab on Kennedy Boulevard, said restaurants are benefitting from Tampa's new willingness to experiment with different dishes. People she thought would never try bone marrow are ordering it with gusto.\nPierola adjusts her menu according to what sells. She keeps track of nightly orders and looks at finished dinner plates to see what guests ate and what they pushed to the side.\nOften that means keeping the same item on a menu even if the chef is tired of making it, said Ferenc, outing Mise en Place's popular chocolate pecan toffee mousse.\nAnd the culinary magic that works at a restaurant might not succeed at home for picky eaters. Despite exposing her 17-year-old to all kinds of food, Perry said he still wants food from one place: Chipotle.\nBJ's Wholesale Club caught my attention with this offer of a free Thanksgiving turkey for buying five qualifying items now through Nov. 13.\nBut check out some of the 10 holiday-related products: eight-pack of Del Monte cut green beans; 36 frozen Pillsbury biscuits; 4 pounds of Mama's frozen cheese ravioli; 80 Jonathan T's frozen puff pastries; eight-pack of Knorr Pasta and Rice Side dishes.

This spacecraft would launch to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2024, scoop up a small sample of comet dust and pebbles from its surface, and return the sample to Earth in 2038.\nTHE WOODLANDS, Texas \u2014 Should NASA send a quadcopter to explore the Saturn moon Titan, or launch a spacecraft to fetch a sample from a comet? Only one of these space missions will be selected to launch in the mid-2020s, and the competition is on as the two science teams strive to make a compelling case for their out-of-this-world ideas.\nThe two mission concepts were selected from 12 proposals as the finalists for NASA's New Frontiers program, which conducts medium-cost robotic space exploration missions (like Juno and New Horizons) capped at $1 billion.\nOne of the proposed missions, called Dragonfly, aims to send a quadcopter to Saturn's largest moon, Titan. NASA's Cassini mission and the European Space Agency's Huygens probe have shown that Titan could potentially host extraterrestrial life, and Dragonfly would further explore that possibility. Its design would enable it to both fly around in Titan's atmosphere and land on its surface. \"This particular vehicle has the opportunity to make many hops and move to several locations and continue on with its chemical analysis,\" Green said.\nThe other proposed mission is the Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return Mission (CAESAR). This mission would send a spacecraft \"to an old friend,\" Comet 67P, \"a fabulous comet we probably know the most about because of Rosetta,\" Green said. (Rosetta was a European Space Agency spacecraft that studied Comet 67P from 2014 to 2016.) Much like NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to an asteroid, CAESAR would scoop up a sample without landing on the comet and return approximately 2.8 ounces (80 grams) of comet dust to Earth.\nAnother NASA mission concept competing for the opportunity to launch in 2024 or 2025 is Dragonfly, a robotic rotorcraft that would explore Saturn's largest moon, Titan.\nWhile the Dragonfly mission would be the first of its kind in that it would fly a drone on another world, NASA has done a comet-sample-return mission before. The Stardust mission brought back samples of Comet Wild 2 in 2006. However, Green pointed out that a comet-sample-return mission has been an important priority in the decadal survey, a publication by the National Academy of Sciences that guides NASA's decisions when it comes to selecting missions.\nFor the rest of the year, the Dragonfly and CAESAR teams will be working hard to fine-tune their mission plans by \"taking input from evaluations, mitigating risks and coming up with ways that they can improve their proposals,\" Green said. The winning team will see their mission launch in 2024 or 2025. May the best mission win!"}

The first few times you use the app, it's really quite similar to any other feed reader. The real benefits come later.\nOnce you start checking your feeds and clicking on posts or links that interest you, my6sense starts to rank and prioritize feed items based upon how useful a bit of information may be to you. Eventually, the items you're most likely to be interested are the first that are suggested to you.\nMy6sense does not give you the ability to create tweets or feed posts from scratch, unless they're linking to some content in your stream. This takes some getting used to, but it ultimately helps the app focus on providing a more relevant stream.\nThis relevancy is represented as the \"digital intuition\" progress bar shown on the home screen. As you use the app, this bar rather quickly fills up and ranks you: \"Explorer, Excelling, Mastering, Transcending, and Lord of the Senses.\" Though it's not much in the way of a game, it definitely serves as a reward for honing the app's suggestion engine.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this beta is just how different the Android version is from the iOS version. The app includes a dashboard widget which looks very similar to those that come with the Android Twitter and Facebook apps. It shows one feed item at a time and can be scrolled through by pushing an arrow button on the widget.\nAdditionally, the app presents a greater amount of options to Android users for browsing feeds. In the iOS version, there are two tabs, one labeled \"relevance,\" and one labeled \"time,\" and along the bottom, there are buttons for top messages, feeds, and user profile. Android users have these options, but can also sort through their feeds by individual service, feed source, or user.\n\"Android customers have made their platform choice to avoid limits on what they can or cannot do with their phone, and we too want to avoid limiting your experience to traditional streams based on time or simplistic filters,\" Barak Hachamov, Founder & Chairman of my6sense said.\nAside from the initial time investment required for training the Intuition Engine, my6sense is a handy app, and the feeds it creates are more relevant without being too exclusionary. It can be downloaded for free in the Android Market right now."}

But the true of heart fight on, hoping that sweat and vision can triumph over indifferent sound design.\nThe art-school trio Micachu and the Shapes were debuting songs from their upcoming sophomore album Never during their opening slot on Friday night. But while the band was in good spirits, thanking us all for coming early and clearly beaming with excitement to play with tUnE-yArDs, the echoing walls of the venue flattened out their mix of finely-strummed guitars and sprightly keyboard waves, implying a colorful wave of skewed pop but leaving the details too obscured to deliver.\nPart of this can probably be chalked up to this being one of the U.K. group's first gigs after finishing the album; given a smaller room or more experience with the songs, their charisma could likely overcome any technical obstacles.\nThe loop-happy, live-collage art-dance project tUne-yArDs had their own share of technical difficulties during their headlining set. On record, the piercing keyboard interjection on \"My Country\" can serrate your brain, destroying any apathy you might dream of having. It sounded OK on stage, but kind of tiny.\nNo matter how many drum loops singer/drummer/ukulele-wielder Merrill Garbus and bassist Nate Brenner constructed onstage, their handmade compositions never banged hard enough.\nBut even if the sound wasn't all the way there, Garbus certainly was. No amount of poor mixing can stop that woman's call-to-arms voice, and even if you couldn't always hear how hard she was playing, you could certainly see it.\nIf she wasn't carefully constructing her backing tracks one looped beat at a time, she was showing her ukulele no mercy, furiously strumming it (and then feeding it through who knows how many distortion effects) like she was daring you to call it a twee instrument.\nBy the end of the night Garbus and her backing players had built up enough steam that sound quality just didn't seem as important anymore, leading a rousing sing-a-long of \"don't take my life away/don't take my life away\" during a climactic rendition of equality anthem \"Bizness.\" Clearly, Garbus has too much on her mind to let a flat sound get her down."}

Meanwhile, impoverished East and West Baltimore continue to suffer from decay and disenfranchisement.\nEspecially after last April\u2019s uprising against the police murder of Freddie Gray, this is both an insult to his memory and a slap in the face to Baltimore\u2019s Black community.\nKevin Plank, the multibillionaire owner of Under Armour, a sportswear conglomerate, and his parent real estate company, Sagamore Development, have asked the city to underwrite municipal bonds in order to build and develop a \u201cmini-city\u201d enclave of waterfront parks plus new offices for Under Armour, middle- to upper-class housing, and other industries owned by Plank. This $600 million in tax increment financing, which means \u201cpayment in lieu of taxes,\u201d from the city is the largest such request in U.S. history.\nUnfortunately, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and the majority of the City Council have endorsed this project, which will continue the legacy of segregation and blight while effectively denying access to these areas for the oppressed. It will criminalize their very presence, as has happened in Harbor Place, another municipal brainchild that was supposed to \u201credevelop\u201d the city and bring jobs for the unemployed. Instead, it resulted in minimum-wage jobs along with the development of more condos and residential units for the wealthy.\nMost community leaders have called this nothing but corporate welfare, comparable to the building, 50 years ago, of the Charles Center, which promised to bring a thriving downtown, surrounded by robust affordable housing and parks. However, that dream became a nightmare of increased unemployment, closed businesses, and lack of accessibility or affordability for Black people.\nBy far the most pressing issue in this whole city-financed project is the fight for affordable housing for all working people and the oppressed. The project\u2019s many opponents include the ACLU; Maryland Working Families; the People\u2019s Power Assembly; the Maryland Consumer Rights Coalition; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; UNITE HERE Local 7; City Advocates for the Homeless; and the Baltimore Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by the Rev. C.D. Witherspoon.\nCity Council President Jack Young gave his wholehearted support to this giveaway.

Soon subtly harmonized, the horn (played by Chance\u2019s constant sideman and alter-ego, Donnie Trumpet) teeters between controlled and offhanded play, tumbling almost accidentally into short, congested melismas. The impression is of an excited warmup, less an announcement than the happy hurry that precedes one. In this way, the trumpet is a kind of synecdoche for Chance\u2019s ramplike gift: in the course of a verse, a song, or, here, the ecstatic whole of an album, he always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else. Chance is a funny, earnest, off-kilter lyricist, but his real power\u2014this ability to always be building\u2014rises from a level far beneath text. \u201cColoring Book\u201d is, above all, a showcase for its creator\u2019s preternatural understanding of the elements that make up a mood.\n\u201cAll We Got,\u201d the horn-led first song of \u201cColoring Book,\u201d feels like a sequel to \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d and not only because it is another collaboration with West. As the trumpet gives way to the crack of a drum machine, Chance vamps for a while, quietly sharing his version of domestic bliss: \u201cTryna turn my baby mamma to my fianc\u00e9e / She like music, she from Houston like Auntie \u2019Yonc\u00e9.\u201d Then, suddenly overtaken by love, he starts to bellow: \u201cMan, my daughter couldn\u2019t haaave a better mooother! / If she ever find another, he better love her / Man, I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it / If I die, I\u2019ll probably cry at my own service.\u201d Meanwhile, the horn honks keep coming, and when Kanye enters, auto-tuning the song\u2019s chorus (\u201cThis is all we got / Isn\u2019t this all we got? / So we might as well give it all we got\u201d), he\u2019s accompanied by sped-up samples of gospel hollers, the signature stylistic tic of his early beatmaking career. This is appropriate: just as West is Chance\u2019s encouraging big brother and cheerleader (just the other day, on Twitter, he enthused, \u201cChance too good. God level bars\u201d), West\u2019s first album, \u201cThe College Dropout,\u201d is a kind of mentor text to \u201cColoring Book,\u201d especially in its insistence on a kinship between gospel and rap. But where Kanye\u2019s devotion has always resembled the near-mystic inwardness and complexity of John\u2019s Gospel, Chance is more like the apostles of Acts: he relentlessly, almost compulsively, evangelizes and invites.\nThe breadth of references in \u201cColoring Book\u201d helps this attempt at inclusion along. At the end of \u201cBlessings,\u201d Chance injects snippets of the gospel artist Fred Hammond\u2019s 1998 hit \u201cLet the Praise Begin\u201d: \u201cAre you ready for your blessing? / Are you ready for your miracle?\u201d Hammond is from the same generation as Kirk Franklin, a similar artist who has succeeded with young, semi-secular audiences, using the same genre-bending approach to composition and style.

But the basic takeaway is that there are plenty of industries that are benefiting from the current corporate tax code, and are likely to fight like hell to preserve the breaks they're currently getting. Moreover, as Appelbaum notes, a lot of these industries are the sympathetic ones: \"High-tech industries pay relatively little in taxes. Utilities and other infrastructure providers pay some of the highest rates. ... Mr. Damodaran says much of the difference is a question of life cycle. Young industries tend to be plowing more of their revenues into research and equipment and other kinds of spending that the government rewards with tax breaks.\"\nAnd that's really what corporate tax reform will be about. \"Loopholes\" sound like bad things. \"Incentives to plow more revenues into research and development and equipment\" don't.

{"idx": "14250", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: There\u2019s a rule of thumb that can come in handy when you hear about new planet discoveries from the Kepler space mission. If they\u2019re talking about a handful of new worlds orbiting distant stars, it\u2019s an actual discovery. If they\u2019re talking about hundreds, it\u2019s not actual planets but \u201cplanet candidates,\u201d which haven\u2019t yet been independently verified \u2014 a key step before scientists can claim they\u2019ve genuinely found something.\nOf these new worlds, none is what NASA scientist Jack Lissauer calls \u201cEarth 2.0,\u201d meaning an Earth-size planet in an Earth-like orbit around a sun-like star. Just four of the planets, in fact, sit in their stars\u2019 so-called habitable zones, where water could plausibly exist in liquid form on the surface. And in these cases, the stars are smaller and dimmer than the sun, while the planets are bulkier than Earth. But most of the new planets are between Neptune and Earth in size, confirming a trend of moderate-size planets that astronomers have been seeing for several years now \u2014 and giving them good reason to think that true twins of Earth aren\u2019t at all uncommon.\nThe reason for such a huge leap in planet verifications is based on another trend astronomers have noticed: most of the planets they\u2019re finding come not singly but in solar systems containing two, three, four or more planets. That\u2019s not a huge surprise, given our solar system\u2019s eight (formerly nine).\nLissauer and other theorists realized, however, that that fact gave them a way to vet planet candidates in wholesale fashion. The reason you need a double check at all is that Kepler finds new worlds by looking for a slight dimming as a planet passes in front of its star, blocking a tiny bit of the star\u2019s light. Other astronomical phenomena can mimic that effect, though \u2014 most notably a pair of stars that orbit each other, with one passing in front of the other. So astronomers confirm candidates using other techniques \u2014 looking for the gravitational wobble the planet imposes on the star, for example \u2014 which have to be done one candidate at a time.\nIt would be much less likely, however, for something to mimic a swarm of planets passing in front of a star and dimming it, each with its own rhythm based on orbital distance. The risk of a false positive, in other words, is exceedingly low. All of the planets just announced are indeed multiples, with 715 worlds distributed among just 305 stars.\nMuch of that could become clearer with a new generation of space telescopes scheduled to go into orbit later in the decade. One is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which will look for planet-induced dimming in bright stars, mostly close to Earth; another is the James Webb Space Telescope, whose huge mirror and powerful infrared-sensitive cameras will look for chemical signatures of life in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets.\nKepler, meanwhile, will keep finding planets \u2014 not so much through new observations, since a malfunction last spring has left it crippled, but via the backlog of observations that still haven\u2019t been analyzed. The new planets, said Lissauer, come from the first two years\u2019 worth of Kepler data. That means a lot of planets are yet to come, including some with longer, more Earth-like orbits."}

We've given them to your father to invest'.\"\nThey asked for an assurance that Mr Cornwell could be trusted but Le Carr\u00e9 cannot recall what he and Tony replied.\nIn the 1950s, Mr Cornwell staged what Le Carr\u00e9 calls his \"biggest public failure\", involving \u00a31.25 million.\nAt this point several documents bearing Le Carr\u00e9's signature \"in my capacity as an officer of one of his 80-something worthless companies\" came under legal scrutiny.\n\"But I didn't remember signing the documents, or accepting a post in any of his companies,\" he writes. \"Whether I told the receiver this, or lied to protect Ronnie, I simply forget.\"\nLe Carre went on to serve in MI5, and recalls the head of personnel asking him: \" 'Forgiven your father yet?'

For example, Tun Mahathir needs to offer an explanation how he has come out with the RM110 billion price tag for the project.\nThe KL-Singapore HSR project has been previously agreed by both the Malaysian and Singapore governments and a breach of agreement will entail a massive sum of compensation.\nAnd since the project is bound by the bilateral agreement, this project can only be officially cancelled if Singapore also agrees to exit the agreement.\nThe project is believed to enhance the economic and financial cooperation between the two countries, and its cancellation means such an opportunity of mutual cooperation will now become void.\nIn addition, scrapping the HSR project will also impact certain development plans in Singapore, in particular the Jurong Lake District at the southern end of the line.\nAs for the compensation, Singapore is believed to seek the rightful compensation provided under the agreement. However, Singapore is also expected to do all it can to preserve the friendly relationship with Malaysia and refrain from doing anything that could jeopardize the Malaysian economy.\nOver the long term, the HSR project should boost the movement of people and economic activities in cities and towns along the route, and act as a catalyst for the development of peripheral areas and create tons of employment opportunities.\nThese positive factors should fall within the serious consideration of the government before making the final decision to axe the project, as similar infrastructural projects help lift cross-border economic activities and movement of people and goods, hence significantly expanding the market.\nMega projects by the previous BN administration such as KL-Singapore HSR have positive effects in boosting the domestic construction industry. As such, construction companies will have to bear the brunt if the HSR project is terminated.\nAs for those who have invested in properties along the rail line, their anticipated returns will have to be adjusted. On the contrary, the aviation industry is poised to benefit from the decision, and will continue to reap the windfall from the KL-Singapore route, among the busiest in the world.\nWhile scrapping the project helps contain near-term fiscal expenditure, it denies the country of mid- to long-term economic-lifting potentials.\nThat said, the market remains upbeat that the project will be reconsidered once the country's economic climate improves. However, the government still needs to handle the follow-up works of terminating the HSR project with the country's overall interest in perspective to ensure the national economy is put back on the right track."}
{"idx": "14261", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina.\nUp until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era. Hadn't these people received the memo? The country had \"moved on\" - or at least it was supposed to have done, according to former president Carlos Menem.\nMenem, a Ferrari-driving free-marketeer who is Argentina's very own morphing of Margaret Thatcher and John Gotti, was first elected in 1989, with the economy in recession and inflation soaring. Claiming that many of Argentina's economic troubles stemmed from botched attempts by his predecessor to bring to justice the generals of the Dirty War, Menem offered an alternative approach: instead of going backwards into the hell of unmarked graves and the lies of the past, he said, Argentinians should wipe the slate clean, join the global economy and then put all of their energy into the pursuit of economic growth.\nAfter pardoning the generals, Menem launched a zealous programme of what here in Latin America is called \"neo-liberalism\": that is, mass privatisations, public sector layoffs, labour market \"flexibilisation\" and corporate incentives. He slashed federal meals programmes, cut the national unemployment fund by almost 80%, laid off hundreds of thousands of state employees and made many strikes illegal. Menem dubbed this rapid free-market makeover \"surgery without anaesthesia\", and assured voters that, once the short-term pain subsided, Argentina would be, in the words of one of his advertising campaigns, \"born again\".\nThe middle-class residents of Buenos Aires, many of them ashamed of their own complicity or complacency during the Dirty War, enthusiastically embraced the idea of living in a shiny new country without a past. \"Don't get involved,\" the mantra of the terror years, gave way seamlessly to \"Look out for Number One\", the mantra of high capitalism, in whose cause neighbours are competitors and the market is put before all else, including the quest for justice and the rebuilding of shattered communities. In the years that followed, 1990s Buenos Aires went on a career and consumerism jag that would put the most shopaholic, workaholic New Yorker or Londoner to shame. According to government data, between 1993 and 1998, total household spending increased by $42bn, while spending on imported goods doubled over the same high-rolling five years, from $15bn in 1993 to $30bn in 1998.\nIn the swanky neighbourhoods of Recoleta and Palermo, residents bought not only the latest imported electronics and designer fashions, but also new faces and new bodies - Buenos Aires soon rivalled Rio de Janeiro as a capital of cosmetic surgery, with one plastic surgeon alone boasting 30,000 clients. Argentinians clearly wanted to be remade, just like their country - and like their president, who himself disappeared periodically, to re"}

While that&apos;s hardly a racy idea, it didn&apos;t clearly fit Hallmark&apos;s image of families and tear-jerkers. But Kenin thought certain Westerns could have appeal to Hallmark viewers and\u2014most important\u2014provide an alternative to other cable offerings.\n\u201cIt was out of bounds with everything we&apos;d done, but it was counterprogramming to everything else on TV,\u201d recalls Kenin, executive VP of programming for Hallmark&apos;s parent Crown Media Holdings.\nAny doubters at Hallmark were quickly silenced. The move proved a success and Hallmark acquired more Westerns\u2014including reruns of Gunsmoke\u2014to build a block.\nIn the years since, Kenin continued to expand Hallmark&apos;s programming arsenal, producing original movies and acquiring movies and series such as Westerns, love stories, mysteries and holiday-themed programs. But with every program, he says the key is to stay true to Hallmark&apos;s family-friendly brand. For a show to fit in, \u201cWe have to have something about family relationships and caring, cherishing and often celebrations,\u201d he says. That early Western, for example, was about a widower and his relationship with his son.\nKenin&apos;s efforts have contributed to Hallmark&apos;s steady ratings growth. The network finished seventh in primetime among all cable networks in the first quarter and is now regularly a top 10 network among women 25-54 and adults 25-54, its target demographics. Kenin&apos;s original movies have been key. Last year, Hallmark aired 18 original movies that averaged a 2.6 rating, doubling its primetime average. A recent film, The Good Witch, starring Catherine Bell, soared to a 3.8 rating when it premiered in January.\nThis year, Hallmark is increasing its production to 30 original movies per year. \u201cWe would not be able to that without David&apos;s track record,\u201d Schleiff says.\nKenin has honed that knack for programming through four decades in local and network TV. After earning a master&apos;s degree from Syracuse University&apos;s esteemed Newhouse School of Public Communications, Kenin entered CBS&apos; management training program. He moved through several departments, including CBS News during the 1968 presidential election, and into corporate planning. After CBS, Kenin moved into local TV, joining an independent station in Philadelphia, WPHL, as head of operations.\nHe bought cartoons like Woody Woodpecker and Tom and Jerry to air on Sunday mornings and weekday afternoons. These were the days before cable and no other station was running animated shows in the time periods. \u201cWe found an underserved audience and had tremendous success,\u201d he says.\nIn 12 years at USA, Kenin also acquired the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) and the Westminster Dog Show, which remain event staples on the network. He also was an early architect of the Sci Fi Channel.\nHis experience with sports at USA led Kenin to join CBS Sports in 1994 as the division&apos;s president, where he worked on deals including the NCAA men&apos;s basketball tournament and Masters golf tournament.

Not part of the investigation. Did she conceal and illegally remove federal records? Not part of the investigation. And no word on the pay-for-play schemes with the Clinton Foundation and its donors. How did the classified material get on Clinton\u2019s system? Comey confessed his FBI didn\u2019t even investigate this basic question.\nOne analysis of Comey\u2019s legal sophistry is that he saw that the fix was in and he wasn\u2019t going to cause a crisis and put his job on the line by recommending a prosecution to a compromised and conflicted Obama Justice Department.\nComey may think he\u2019s successfully threaded the political needle \u2013 highlighting Clinton\u2019s malfeasance while giving her a get-out-of-jail-free card. But all he\u2019s done is further lowered the reputation of the FBI in the eyes of the American people."}

{"idx": "14279", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The plan to 3D-print a bridge in mid-air was always bonkers. How could a technology best known for creating flimsy prototypes and personalized action figures be used for permanent construction projects? Well, the team at MX3D in Amsterdam just answered all of the hard questions and revealed it: the world\u2019s first 3D-printed bridge. It\u2019s made of a completely new type of steel, spans 40 feet, and will be installed early next year in De Wallen, the largest and best-known red-light district in Amsterdam. It also looks utterly otherworldly.\nThe newly printed bridge just arrived back in MX3D\u2019s workshop in north Amsterdam from a larger facility outside the city. There, the team of designers and engineers that has been working on the project for years will test the bridge\u2019s integrity and add some finishing touches, including a clear coat to protect the ruddy steel exterior from the elements and a steel deck\u2014which is basically just a huge plate of traditional steel\u2014that will serve as a walkway. The final phase will include the installation of a series of smart sensors that will monitor the bridge\u2019s health and take a slew of measurements in real-time, including air quality and weight dispersion so the bridge will actually know how many people are walking on it and how quickly they\u2019re moving. The sensor data will also be fed to a \u201cdigital twin\u201d bridge model that will help engineers understand how the bridge is performing over time and make tweaks to future designs accordingly.\nSafety is a key part of all of these tests and the sensor network that will follow. Given the fact that a 3D-printed bridge like this has never existed, MX3D worked with the city to establish a unique, new safety standard as well as a testing plan to ensure the bridge\u2019s lasting integrity. The sensor network will also enable engineers to monitor and address safety issues with such accuracy that the 3D-printed might well be the safest bridge in the city.\nBut obviously, the bridge\u2019s 3D-printed construction will turn heads. It has since 2015, when MX3D shocked the world by announcing plans to 3D-print the bridge in mid-air over one of Amsterdam\u2019s canals. That concept explored the possibility of using a new custom-designed type 3D-printing robots that could create weight-bearing structures below them and then slide forward as the hot building material set. These so-called MX3D bots could build things of any size by moving around the object in open air rather than inside of a machine. Theoretically, such technology would let them print massive structures safely on location.\nThe genesis of the 3D-printed bridge was unconventional to say the least. In 2004, Joris Laarman founded a design lab in Amsterdam and began experimenting with various materials and applications for various technologies. Much of Laarman\u2019s work looked to natural designs for inspiration, but a growing interest in technology led to the development of a six-axis robot that could do large-scale, free-form 3D printing and the founding of MX3D. Whereas traditional 3D-printing takes place inside of a machine, this new type of technology could print in mid-air without conventional limitations.\nLaarman and his co-founders first used the new MX3D printers for several experiments before creating a sculpture called The Dragon Bench. This art piece used a combination of metals to create a self-supporting structure that looks a big rusty wave. Dragon Bench sculptures are now in museum collections around the world, but"}

This is absurd and unnecessary.\nIn Canada and Australia, nations with similar environmental standards, the mine permitting process takes just two to three years on average. We can and should do better. Revising our permitting process and protecting the environment are not mutually exclusive. Commonsense reforms are available, if we choose to act.\nPresident Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure plan highlights the urgency of reform. The Trump administration has already signaled its interest in using American-made materials, where possible, to rebuild or expand our roads, airports, railroads, and pipelines. Spending billions overseas on zinc, iron ore, and copper, among other metals, wouldn\u2019t fit that American-made goal. But our mines and mills can meet this need \u2014 and provide good-paying jobs \u2014 if we level the playing field for our producers by reforming our regulatory policies.\nInfrastructure is just a small part of the coming demand, however. Our technology-driven economy has an increasingly voracious appetite for minerals and metals. Take the batteries used in all of our smart phones and a growing number of our cars. The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is the perfect example of the challenge and opportunity before us.\nEVs are no longer a technology on the horizon. They\u2019re here. Consider that between 2010 and 2015, just 1 million EVs were sold globally. However, more than 2 million EVs are expected to be sold in 2020 alone. Forecasters are increasingly bullish, and Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects that EVs will capture 50 percent of the new car market by 2040. Wood Mackenzie thinks EVs could offset 20 percent of global oil demand by 2035.\nThe emergence of EVs has coincided with major advancements in lithium-ion batteries. And while these batteries have gotten better and cheaper, demand for lithium and other building block minerals and metals \u2014 like nickel, graphite and cobalt \u2014 has soared.\nFor example, just one battery for a high-end Tesla uses as much lithium carbonate as roughly 10,000 cell phones. And global lithium demand is on track to quadruple by 2025. It\u2019s no surprise that Goldman Sachs has called lithium the new gasoline.\nWe may well be sleepwalking from a dependence on OPEC toward a similar dependence on foreign minerals and metals suppliers. Fortunately, some are aware"}
{"idx": "14295", "prompt": "Continue the following text: When and how did the United States \u00adbecome a nation? This question is the core of \u201cThe Quartet.\u201d In his customary graceful prose, Joseph J. Ellis, the author of such works of popular history as the prizewinning \u201cFounding Brothers,\u201d argues that the United States did not become a nation with the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Rather, he says, American nationhood resulted from the creation, \u00adadoption and effectuation of the United States \u00adConstitution.\nThis passage distills the strengths and weaknesses of \u201cThe Quartet.\u201d Ellis rightly expands his focus beyond the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to consider the process of reform leading to the Convention and the process of decision making flowing from the proposed Constitution. The weakness of \u201cThe Quartet\u201d is that it does not look past the figures standing center stage in Ellis\u2019s story.\nPolitical processes can be uncooperative, unpredictable and wrongheaded. That was the case with politics in the United States in 1783-89. For example, Hamilton wanted a consolidated government that would hold the nation together, but he did not get what he wanted. He failed despite seven years of demanding constitutional reform, and hours at the 1787 Convention expounding his design for a strong central government. Aware of his failure, Hamilton even shared with Madison his own draft for a constitution to show what he thought an adequate document would look like. Similarly with Madison. In 1789, he became the leading advocate in the First Federal Congress of adding rights-protecting amendments to the Constitution, but encountered bitter opposition that almost overwhelmed him. Pro-Constitution representatives spurned his proposed amendments as unnecessary, while unreconciled opponents of the Constitution rejected them as inadequate. All the members of Ellis\u2019s quartet grumbled regularly, frustrated at the opposition facing them and the likelihood of failure; this was the frustration of skilled politicians warily assessing the maze of \u00adinstitutional, political and personal obstacles standing between them and their goal.\n\u201cThe Quartet\u201d also raises larger \u00adquestions challenging assumptions undergirding Ellis\u2019s book. First, when he writes about an American nation, what does he mean? Is an American nation the same as a national government uniting all 13 states as one entity? That is not what the Constitution creates; \u00adfederalism\u2019s presence in the Constitution complicated issues of sovereignty, union and \u00adnationhood, then and after. Further, Ellis neglects the complicated relationship between a nation\u2019s identity and its form of government, a commonplace of Enlightenment thought well known to the \u00adfounding fathers. Though nationalism may be linked to a particular type of government, a people\u2019s sense of identity is not the same as a nation\u2019s political arrangements.\nEllis sees American nationhood as the creation of a few politicians working from above. But what of sentiments of \u00adnational identity among the American people? \u00adEllis rejects the idea that American \u00adnationalism existed before 1787, even reproving Abraham Lincoln for making that claim; his endnotes airily dismiss scholarship arguing otherwise. Nonetheless, currents of nationalism before 1787 helped make possible both the American victory in the Revolution and the Constitution\u2019s adoption. The Continental Army fought for the independence of the American Union, not of 13 sovereign states. Thomas Paine and other pamphleteers agitated for an independent America. And those backing the Constitution (including three of the four members of Ellis"}

The customary excuse of \u2018There really isn\u2019t time to keep up with everything on telly\u2019 might work for most series. But now that GoT is officially a programme that everybody watches (apart from all the people who don\u2019t), it\u2019s beginning to feel a bit feeble for this one. So it was that, after swotting up as best I could on the scores of backstories over the weekend, I decided to give the final series a go.\nI was, of course, expecting the show to have an epic feel. Nonetheless, it was something of a surprise to discover just how thoroughly GoT embraces the traditional trappings of the genre: not merely the castles lit by flaming torches, the randomly medieval names, the frank fetishisation of swords and so on, but also the distinct air of self-importance and the often comically po-faced dialogue.\nStill, it could have been worse. Thanks to Jon Snow, the still-alive people have assembled \u2018the greatest army the world has ever seen\u2019, complete with two dragons of their own. What they might not have, mind you, is the required unity. Many of the northerners want Jon Snow (it seems obligatory always to use his full name) to remain their king. Unfortunately, as about the only character not obsessed with personal power, he\u2019s \u2018bent the knee\u2019 to Daenerys, making her Winterfell\u2019s Queen \u2014 although his motives may extend beyond a selfless desire for military alliance. In one particularly touching scene, the couple mounted a CGI dragon each and flew to an isolated CGI waterfall for a spot of quality time together. \u2018We could stay here a thousand years. No one would find us,\u2019 mused Daenerys. \u2018We\u2019d be pretty old,\u2019 Jon Snow unarguably replied.\nIt\u2019s impossible not to admire the sheer scale and ambition of GoT\u2019s story-telling: its unrelenting twistiness, its endless piling up of moral dilemmas, its almost Brexit-like ability to keep us entirely in the dark as to how it will all end (although I\u2019m guessing the makers won\u2019t be asking for an extension). I can even buy the idea that it\u2019s a powerful portrait of the effects of power \u2014 and it certainly passed the key test of any drama series, by making me want to watch the remaining episodes.\nAnd yet, I still can\u2019t help wondering if, in their quiet moments, even the most die-hard of GoT fans have to suppress a little inner voice asking whether the whole thing is well\u2026 just a little bit corny."}

It is the story of Las Delicias Patisserie, a wonderful artisan bakery producing high end goodies that are sure to put a smile on your face, and in a twist that is worthy of a truly fabulous bedtime story, many of their insanely delicious products just so happen to be gluten free.\nLas Delicias was one of those many business endeavors that evolved out of pure necessity. Deborah Brenner, a Riverdale resident, was trying to find gluten free baked goods for her husband who suffers from celiac, but found herself disappointed with the items that were available in the market.\nUnwilling to settle for mediocrity, Brenner decided to take matters into her own hands.\nBrenner drew on her own multicultural roots in creating her business. Born in Argentina, she had spent many happy hours in the kitchen with her mother and Italian grandmother baking and cooking. An eight year stint living in France further broadened her culinary horizons and the name \u201cLas Delicias,\u201d which translates as \u201cthe delights,\u201d is a nod to summers spent in an ocean-front home located on Avenue Las Delicias in Punta Del Este, Uruguay.\nIntent on her goal of using all natural ingredients, it comes as no surprise that many of Las Delicias\u2019s products are dairy because they are made with real butter, although most of the gluten free items are pareve.\nCreating the ultimate gluten free challah took significant amounts of experimentation in order to create a product that would not only taste good but could also be braided like conventional challah. Las Delicias\u2019s gluten free challah is made with a variety of flours including oat, brown rice, millet, garbanzo, sorghum and fava bean and both potato and tapioca starches, with every challah braided by hand. For those who eat gluten, Las Delicias offers several tempting challahs including chocolate chip, cinnamon and mixed seed as well as a pearl sugar topped loaves. All of Las Delicias\u2019 products are certified kosher by Rabbi Chaim Goldberger of the Twin Cities Community Kashruth Council and are supervised locally by Rabbi Michoel Guttmacher. Both Rabbi Binyomin Taub of the RCBC and Rabbi Avrohom Marmorstein of Mehadrin Kashrus allow Las Delicias\u2019s pareve products to be sold in establishments carrying their hechsher and Brenner is currently in the process of obtaining a heimishe hashgacha on her products as well.\nBrenner, who uses all locally sourced products in her baking, prides herself on being part of Greenmarket, an effort to promote regional agriculture while giving consumers access to the freshest items.

Black people make up 12% of the US population, but more than 18% of the federal workforce, according to a study by the Partnership for Public Service.\nHiring discrimination in the private sector has long driven black Americans to government jobs (federal, state and local) for steady, gainful employment. Following the legislative civil rights gains of the 1960s, government agencies, especially federal, generally held themselves more stringently to anti-discrimination laws than private employers of the era.\nIn turn, black Americans \u201csaw that public service employment opened up economic opportunities for good, well-paid jobs that provide some measure of protection against discrimination,\u201d according to Farah Ahmad, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress writing during the 2013 government shutdown.\n\u201cThe competitive pay scales of government employment have lifted generations of black people into the middle class,\u201d she added.\nPerhaps nowhere is that more true than in the predominantly black Washington DC suburbs Prince George\u2019s county in Maryland. The county is home to the highest concentration of middle-class black Americans in the country, largely due to public sector employment.\n\u201cAround here people\u2019s families work for the government, generationally,\u201d said Kenneth Graves, a federal employee currently on furlough who grew up in Prince George\u2019s.\nGraves, who is black, said he can probably sustain about another month of the shutdown before he depletes the last of his savings. A furloughed Federal Aviation Administration employee, Graves is currently looking for part-time work in hospitality to keep some income coming in, and stay occupied.\nThe profound racial wealth gap in the US makes it far more difficult for the average black American to sustain a long period without a paycheck as compared to white Americans or the US average. Median black household wealth is about $1,700 and falling, while median white wealth sits at over $116,000, according to a 2017 study by Prosperity Now and the Institute for Policy Studies.\nGraves said he\u2019s already called his student loan provider to ask for a deferment while Williams told the Guardian she\u2019s still dreading a call to her landlord to ask if she can postpone her next month\u2019s payment.\nShe scoffed at a letter to federal employees sent out near the beginning of the shutdown suggesting ways to ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d during the furlough.\n\u201cThey say talk to these creditors?

During the Martian winter, engineers directed the rovers to north-facing slopes, so that their solar panels could soak up as much sunlight as possible each day. When one of Spirit\u2019s wheels stopped working, it kept going by driving backwards, dragging the defunct wheel behind it.\nBut in 2009, the rover\u2019s wheels broke through some crust and slipped into a sand pit. Engineers tried maneuvering the wheels this way and that, but the rover was stuck. For the first time, Spirit couldn\u2019t make its way to a sunny slope.\nSpirit entered hibernation mode and never woke up. The mission was declared over more than a year after the rover\u2019s last message to Earth and months of attempts to restore contact.\nNow it could be Opportunity\u2019s turn. The rover hasn\u2019t called home in 237 days.\nLast June, an enormous storm swept across the planet, clogging the atmosphere with sunlight-blocking dust, and the rover, unable to charge its batteries in the darkness, slipped into a deep sleep.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t given up yet,\u201d Squyres said.\nBut the end seems closer now than before. The team has attempted to contact Opportunity more than 600 times since it stopped communicating with Earth last June. At NASA, engineers operate in a realm with the motto \u201cFailure is not an option,\u201d and the agency has a long record of successfully repairing and reviving missions, from Apollo capsules to robotic probes. But the silence feels heavier with each passing day.\nDust storms are common during Martian summer, and Opportunity, about the size of a golf cart, had weathered a similar tempest about a decade earlier.\nThis time, as the Martian sky darkened, the rover automatically shut off nearly all functions to preserve energy. Engineers suspected that when the storm passed, Opportunity would recharge and awaken with a chirp sent back to Earth. But the skies cleared in September, and the rover didn\u2019t wake up.\nThe team was not deterred. A season known for dust devils would soon begin on Mars. Perhaps Opportunity\u2019s solar panels were coated in a thick layer of dust, and the wind gusts would wipe it away. But that season ends soon, and Opportunity remains silent.\nLast week, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which operates Opportunity, announced that engineers would send a new set of commands to the rover in the next several weeks. The instructions assume some worst-case scenarios for the rover\u2019s systems. \u201cWe have not exhausted all the possibilities yet, but we\u2019ve exhausted quite a few of them,\u201d Squyres said.\nI asked Squyres whether the team had any more ideas for how to command the rover awake, in case their latest strategy doesn\u2019t work. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\nAfter that, the final call regarding Opportunity\u2019s fate is up to NASA leadership.

{"idx": "14301", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Ask some gold bugs why Gold has not broken out yet and you will probably get the usual answers. Some will say it\u2019s due to manipulation or price suppression. Others will mention the current rally in the US Dollar (while neglecting that the previous decline in the greenback was unable to take Gold to a new high). Few would say the fundamentals are not in place. No one can know for certain but Gold\u2019s fundamentals have not improved over the past year and are not where they need to be to support a breakout.\nThe vast majority of history shows us that Gold is inversely correlated to real interest rates (or real yields). It makes perfect sense because Gold has been money for thousands of years. When real rates decline, the real return on money in the bank or in a treasury bill or note decreases. Gold benefits. The corollary is also true. Rising real interest rates indicate stronger real return on money invested in the aforementioned instruments. That\u2019s negative for Gold.\nReal interest rates have actually strengthened for nearly 18 months, as the chart below shows. Gold has performed well during that period because of weakness in the US Dollar as well as some anticipation of an escalation in long-term yields.\nGiven the rise in real interest rates, it is not a surprise that investment demand for Gold has been weak. Gold bugs frequently trumpet strong demand from China and how tight the physical Gold market is but in reality, investment demand is what drives bull markets. Investment demand tends to respond to or follow negative and/or declining real interest rates.\nOne way of measuring investment demand in real time is by following the amount of Gold held in the GLD trust. As we can see below, investment demand (by this metric) confirmed the rebound in Gold in the first half of 2016. However, it has essentially been flat over the past 18 months as Gold rebounded from the low $1100s all the way to $1360.\nSo if Gold\u2019s fundamentals are not bullish and investment demand is flat, what conditions need to change that would benefit Gold?\nObviously, Gold needs declining real interest rates. It needs some combination of an acceleration in inflation and a pause or slowdown in short-term yields including the Fed Funds rate. Inflation has risen in recent quarters but short-term yields have risen faster as evidenced by the increase in real interest rates (shown in our first chart).\nWeeks ago Gold was sniffing a breakout as long-term bond yields, such as the 10-year and 30-year yield were also threatening a breakout. An upside break in long-term yields would be significant for Gold as it would signal an increase in inflation expectations and pressure the balance sheets of both an over-indebted corporate sector as well as a government already running the largest non-recessionary, peacetime budget deficit in history. However, bond yields have yet to breakout even as the masses have positioned for such. In other words, Bonds could be ripe for a counter-trend rally which means yields would be ripe for a counter-trend decline.\nAn upside breakout in bond yields could also potentially lead to a new uptrend in the Gold to Stocks ratio. It could cause issues in the economy and stock market which would in turn, benefit Gold. While Gold is in a new uptrend relative to Bonds (not shown) and is currently firming against foreign currencies, it has not been able to sustain strength relative to the equity market. From an intermarket perspective this is the link that has been missing to put Gold in a real bull market."}

Certainly, these weren\u2019t the only challenges the collaborators would face. Facing backlash (courtesy of the Internet) over their portrayal of one particular Disney princess, the pair would thoroughly examine prevalent ideas about representation on the animated screen, and in more ways than one.\nTo what extent did you intend a satire of the Internet and Internet culture with Ralph Breaks the Internet, apart from those themes that were most critical to this film?\nJohnston: And now you spend way too much time on the Internet.\nMoore: Yeah. [Laughs] I have a deep, deep love for that culture, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s so much taking potshots at it or satirizing it, or just representing what it is that I loved about it, warts and all.

I think of the movie as more celebrating the odd things about the Internet, the good things about it, [while] pointing out the not-so-great.\nIn recent years, there have been animated films that have taken on the Internet and the culture of the digital age, though Ralph seems to tackle it in a particularly success way. From your perspective, what made that possible?\nJohnston: All the best relationships in my life are grounded with insults. The people I love the most, we speak to each other in a way where we goof on each other, and make fun of each other. I think we have an abiding love for this world, these characters, so whatever comments we\u2019re making are mostly coming out of a deep understanding and respect of the characters.

Paint it a solid color to create a bold background for notes and photos, or give the piece a custom look by adding a monogram or graphic silhouette. Use a prefab bulletin board or go homemade by gluing a sheet of cork over stiff cardboard or a sheet of shipping foam, sized to fit inside a frame.\nTake the corkboard out of the frame or mask a permanently affixed frame with painter's tape. Use a craft knife to push the tape down flush along the inside edges of the frame.\nCover your workspace with newspaper, and set the corkboard on top of it. Place a block of wood or a screw cap from a beverage bottle under each corner of the corkboard if you were able to remove the frame or your board didn't have one; this allows you to paint the edges of the cork without the paintbrush sticking to the paper.\nSquirt acrylic paint into a disposable container or shake a spray paint can for a minute or two.\nDip a paintbrush into the acrylic paint and apply it to the corkboard in even, overlapping layers. Brush pools of excess paint around to distribute it evenly. Continue until you cover the entire corkboard and edges, if exposed. Leave the board to dry completely. Alternatively, apply spray paint. Begin slightly beyond the edge of the corkboard starting at one corner and working in overlapping horizontal or vertical bands of paint until you cover the entire board. For either paint variety, apply a second coat if needed. Allow the corkboard to dry completely.\nCreate a chevron or stripe design by base-coating the corkboard with one paint color, then applying strips of painter's tape in the desired pattern once the paint dries. Paint over it with a second color, peeling the tape away once the paint dries. For a variation on this look that still shows some of the original cork color as part of the pattern, do not base coat the board; just apply the strips of tape and paint over them.\nCreate a monogram or initial silhouette design by cutting a desired background shape out of cardboard, such as an oval, heart or shield. Tape the cardboard onto the center of the corkboard and paint around it. Remove the cardboard and paint the desired initial or initials inside the center shape. Use a stencil for the lettering, if desired.\nCreate a graphic on the corkboard by first painting it in a solid color, allowing the paint to dry, then painting on a design such as a city skyline or a large dinosaur using a different paint color. Create a stencil for the graphic by drawing the design on contact paper, then cutting it out with a craft knife. Apply the contact paper with the design-shaped hole over the corkboard, then paint through the homemade stencil.

The post rather was likely referring to the pipe bombs that were mailed to various high-profile critics of the Trump administration, the FBI filing indicated.\nClark, 30, was charged on Nov. 9 with transportation of a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high capacity magazines intended for use with AR-15 weapons after a search of his residence in Washington, D.C., turned up the items, according to an FBI affidavit.\nThe suspect lives with his father and sister, and the bureau described him as a neo-Nazi who praised Bowers as a \"hero.\" Bowers has pleaded not guilty to federal hate crime charges. The FBI said Clark posted on conservative social media site Gab that the synagogue victims \"deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse.\" His Gab account has since been deleted.\nBut the Thursday court filing by the U.S. Attorney's Office appeared to acknowledge that the \"dry run\" remark was a response to the Oct. 26 arrest of Cesar Sayoc, who is alleged to have mailed pipe bombs to several critics of President Donald Trump.

Take the issue of \u00e0 la carte cable, for instance. Former chairman Michael Powell was opposed to the idea of allowing customers to simply pick and chose cable channels on a one-by-one basis, but the new Kevin Martin FCC has been toying with the idea for a few months. In the Powell era, we were told that the perceived benefits of \u00e0 la carte were just that: perception, but nothing that would pan out in reality. Roughly a year later, the FCC started to change its tune, questioning whether the Powell-era investigation was correct. Today the FCC has released their newer, updated report.\nIn particular, the Further Report describes a number of errors in the Booz Allen Hamilton (\"Booz Allen\") Study that the Media Bureau relied upon to support the conclusion of the earlier report that \u00e0 la carte is not economical. The Further Report finds that the 2004 report also relied upon unrealistic assumptions and presented biased analysis in concluding that \u00e0 la carte \"would not produce the desired result of lower MVPD rates for most pay-television households.\nWithout making any accusations, the FCC notes that the Booz Allen study was provided to the FCC by the cable industry, and that the study overestimated the cost of single cable channel selections by a whopping 50 percent. Needless to say, such a difference makes all the difference.\nThe problems with the Booz Allen study didn't stop there, however. The FCC also found that in three of four studies, customer bills decreased from 3 to 13 percent for users once the FCC corrected for what Booz Allen had originally reported as untenable subscription configurations. The original study had apparently lowballed the threshold for the total number of channels that could be subscribed to independently while still saving money. And to make matters even worse, the FCC concluded that the Booz Allen study also artificially decreased the number of hours of TV watched daily in their \u00e0 la carte scenarios, attempting to demonstrate another \"negative.\"\nLadies and gentleman, welcome to what happens when you based regulatory decisions on reports from the very industry you're trying to investigate. If it weren't for the fact that these rather significant errors all fall in favor of the cable industry, you might think it was merely a poor study. But as it stands, someone at the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, who funded the seriously flawed study, has some \"splainin\" to do.\nSo, which train for \u00e0 la carte?\n\"We applaud the FCC and chairman Martin for bringing the truth to an issue where only lies and deceit had gone before. Cable choice will help, not hurt, consumers. Consumers -- and especially families -- must be afforded the ability to pick and choose and pay for only those networks they want in their homes.\"\nNote the emphases: \"especially families.\" This statement, by the Parents Television Council, gets at what's really going on here. Cable \"\u00e0 la carte\" is a social issue. Some parents, it would seem, want control over which channels are viewed in their homes, but they would rather not use the parental tools offered to them by the cable industry (channel lockets, etc.). That this really is the driving force behind \u00e0 la carte can be seen in the way that the cable companies responded to Martin's threats in November: they all rolled out \"family packages,\" such as this one from Time Warner.

The joke\u2019s on the Bears, though, because they also made their playoff prospects harder.\nHad the Vikings won this game, Chicago would have hosted them in next weekend\u2019s wild-card game. Given what a mess Minnesota has been all season, and how horrific the Vikings were at Soldier Field last month, that was the optimal scenario.\nInstead, the Bears now have to play the Philadelphia Eagles, who, in addition to being the reigning Super Bowl champions, are the hottest team in the NFL. If there\u2019s a team to avoid in the playoffs, pretty much everyone agrees the Eagles are it, their 24-0 blowout of hapless Washington their sixth victory in the last seven games.\nYes, Nick Foles left the game after taking a shot to the ribs, and the Eagles will only go as far as he can take them. But it seems a minor injury, certainly not one that will keep him off the field next weekend.\nWhich is the worst-possible scenario for the Bears.\nChicago had an outside chance at the No. 2 seed in the NFC \u2013 and the all-important first-round bye \u2013 so it made sense for Nagy to play his starters early. But once it was clear the Rams were going to roll over San Francisco, as it was in the first quarter, Bears coach Matt Nagy should have packed it in. Encased his vaunted defense in bubble wrap, played his backups and, yes, given the Bears an easier opponent next week.\nThis is Chicago\u2019s first playoff appearance since 2010, and the pressure on Mitchell Trubisky is immense. Not exactly ideal for a second-year quarterback for whom consistency has been the biggest knock. You\u2019d think Nagy and the Bears would have preferred he face a familiar opponent, one he\u2019s already beaten twice.\nBut the Bears are where they are \u2014 12-win NFC North champions after four consecutive years in the division basement \u2014 because Nagy has been willing to go against the grain. To his credit, he stayed true to that Sunday. He\u2019d said all week that Chicago was going to play to win, and that\u2019s what it did.\nSo Foles and the Eagles it will be.\nThe career castoff was the epitome of calm and composure after Carson Wentz blew out his knee late last season, taking the Eagles all the way to the Super Bowl. Once there, all Foles did was outplay Tom Brady and the Patriots to give Philadelphia its first-ever title.\nHe\u2019s been no less clutch this season. With Wentz out with a stress fracture in his back and Philadelphia\u2019s playoff hopes remote, Foles led the Eagles to victories in the last three games. That included wins over the Rams and Texans.\nSo no, coming into Soldier Field and facing Chicago\u2019s steel trap of a defense isn\u2019t going to fluster Foles.\nThe Bears also gave away whatever element of surprise they would have had with Nagy.\nNagy lives for the unpredictable, and even his division foes are still trying to figure him out.

Designers can create interesting effects with it, particularly when they use an appealing mix of finishes or colors that highlight the details or contours on a car.\nThis one doesn\u2019t do any of that. It\u2019s just flat, a fact which is exacerbated by Red Bull\u2019s primary-color-heavy aesthetic. The simplified logos might have looked half-decent had they been rendered in anything but complete dullness, but even those just fade into meh on the matte car.\nExpanses of blue not directly lit up by the stage lights just look black, and not even a nice black.

Even if they've had to fabricate it on occasion.\nDo you remember the \"Mai Lai Massacre of the Iraq War?\"\nIt was a Time Magazine cover story in June of 2006. Christopher Matthews interviewed Congressman Jack Murtha (D-PA) on national television, and Murtha said that Marines, in cold blood, had executed more 20 innocent civilians in Haditha, Iraq.\nThe media's story has been falling apart ever since.\n\"No Murder Charges Filed In Haditha Case\"\n\"The Haditha Libels Require Investigation\"\n\"Is the Haditha Story Falling Apart?\"\n\"Time Magazine Massacres the Truth\"\n\"Tim McGirk Re-Invents Haditha Video Source\"\nStarting in mid 2007 things have been going our way a little more in Iraq. Because of this, the war has largely disappeared from the front pages of the nation's newspapers. In place of disaster stories from Iraq, we find stories about profound problems within the military or we read about our hapless soldiers/veterans caricatured as victims, a favorite theme of the MSM. These stories have covered such topics as the spike-up in suicide rates among our soldiers, to the Army being forced to lower recruitment standards in order to meet manpower goals; from the (by now notorious and utterly discredited) multipart New York Times series on our murderous Iraq War veterans to the Army's inability to retain its captains.\nEach of these stories is at best highly misleading. At worst they're utter fabrications. Let's take a look at what passes for \"journalism.\"\n\"Soldier Suicides at Record Level - Increase Linked to Long Wars, Lack of Army Resources\" was the Washington Post headline of January 31. Also check out \"Suspected Army Suicides Set Mark -- Rate is Highest Since First Tracked in 1980\" in USA TODAY. December 12, 2007.\nThe excellent blogger Gateway Pundit has been watching this junk-reporting like a hawk, and it is on his work that primaruily rely here. I urge reading \"Sorry WaPo...More Soldiers Committed Suicide When Clinton Was in Office Than During the Bush Years\" and \"MEDIA MISINFORMS: Fewer Soldiers Commit Suicide During Bush Years\"\n\"[l]ast year, 121 soldiers took their own lives, nearly 20 percent more than in 2006.\"\nGateway Pundit makes the obvious point that you can't look at a one-year time frame of any phenomenon for the purposes of discerning a trend; you must look at many years and then compile a rate. During the Clinton years the average number of suicides in the military was 190/year; during the Bush presidency the average number has been 160/year. That's a 16% decrease in the number of suicides. Gateway Pundit notes the military suicide rate is measurably lower than that of the general public, (17/100,000 versus 20/100,000), 15% lower than the general population.\nA recent ostensible expos\u00e9 on the military's manpower crisis appeared in a January 22, 2008 Associ"}

His solution, though, is wanting.\nAs a fan of Lawrence Lessig\u2019s pioneering work on copyright and digital culture, I was saddened when, a few years back, he shifted his focus to congressional corruption and campaign finance. Efforts to take the money out of politics\u2014as opposed to playing the underdog\u2019s hand as well as possible\u2014had long struck me as a sucker\u2019s game. Either way, you have to beat the moneyed interests. My skepticism deepened at a dinner where Lessig presented his ideas and, in response to hostile questions, seemed unfamiliar with an extensive academic literature casting doubt on the commonsense theory that campaign contributions buy policy results.\nSmart people, it turns out, learn a lot from hostile audiences. Not only does the dinner in question earn a mention in Republic, Lost, the latest fruit of Lessig\u2019s work on money in politics; Lessig has also developed a reply that packs a lot of theoretical punch and should be must-reading for anyone who\u2019s tuned out the campaign-finance debate.\nLessig moves beyond quid pro quo corruption of the sort that typified the Gilded Age and recently ensnared such congressmen as Duke Cunningham of California and William Jefferson of Louisiana. Taking a broader view of the problem, Lessig develops a concept of dependence and independence that draws on the Founding generation\u2019s obsession with the alleged corruption of Parliament at the hands of a monarchy that dispensed pensions and offices to compliant representatives. As part of this analysis, Lessig cites the anthropological concept of a \u201cgift economy\u201d to argue that a person can become indebted to another without any explicit agreement of a quid pro quo.\nSocially and psychologically, human beings do favors for people who have done favors for them. Lobbyists, bund-lers, and campaign contributors don\u2019t need to bribe anyone to exert influence. They just need to give. By the same token (although what is at stake is often hardly a token), it would be illegal and gauche, not to mention unnecessary, for members of Congress to bargain votes explicitly for post-congressional rewards such as trade-association presidencies. Without anyone necessarily being bribed, Lessig argues, a dangerous and unseemly economy of influence has arisen in Washington that renders legislators dependent on lobbyists and all too independent from their constituents or the national interest.\nLessig takes on the model of lobbying as \u201clegislative subsidy\u201d developed by political scientist Richard Hall and economist Alan Deardorff as an alternative to the na\u00efve lobbying-as-bribe model. Legislators come to Washington passionate about several issues. Quickly, though, they come to depend on the economy of influence for help in advancing an agenda. They need the policy expertise, connections, public-relations machine, and all the rest that lobbyists can offer. Since this legislative subsidy is not uniformly available, the people\u2019s representatives find themselves devoting more of their time to those aspects of their agenda that moneyed interests also support. No one is bribed, but the political process is corrupted.\nAt the same time, Lessig argues, fund-raising is not only a way of obtaining campaign cash but a method for members of Congress to live beyond their means. Congressional political action committees engage in massive spending on dinners, parties, retreats at fancy resorts, and other fundraising events with donors. These events enable members to treat themselves to vacations and high-priced meals they couldn\u2019t otherwise afford. Abjuring the money h"}

He ended up with a goal and an assist in the game, but it was the manner in which he scored that was most crucial.\nLate in the game, the Blackhawks found themselves trailing 4-3 to the Stars. On a rush into the offensive zone, Kari Lehtonen made an initial save and the puck skipped toward the corner. Richards quickly went in after it, corralled it, and fired it back toward the front of the net. Instead of bouncing off Lehtonen again and coming out for a rebound attempt for Marian Hossa, the puck slid between the goaltender\u2019s pads and into the net to tie the game at 4-4.\nWhile the play looked like a fluke, it was yet another example of why Joel Quenneville constantly preaches to his players about the importance of getting pucks on net. You never know what will happen when you just fire the puck toward the net, and Richards made his own luck in tying the game.\nToews gets plenty of credit as one of the top two-way players in the NHL, and on Sunday night he added another highlight to his already huge portfolio.\nEarly in the first period, the Stars had seized a 1-0 lead, but the Blackhawks got a great possession out of the first line and were threatening. After Brandon Saad made a nice play to feed the puck over to the point, Brent Seabrook uncorked a slap shot, and Lehtonen steered it away into the corner.\nDallas forward Ales Hemsky dropped below the goal line to play the puck, but Toews had other ideas.\nThe center lifted Hemsky\u2019s stick away from the puck, and with that deft move, the Hawks captain curled back out toward the action in the middle of the ice. Eventually, he found an open lane and feathered a gorgeous pass to a streaking Saad, who deposited the shot into the back of the net to tie things up at 1-1.\nWhile Saad\u2019s smart pinch and Seabrook\u2019s slap shot certainly deserve credit, it was Toews that had the biggest impact on the goal. His continuous defensive pressure makes the other team crazy during games, and he showed off his skills at a critical time in this one.\nSharp was arguably the Hawks\u2019 best player during their Winter Classic loss, scoring a goal and tallying 10 shots on net during the game. On Sunday night, Sharp took advantage of that momentum, as well as a promotion to the second line, to put up a goal and an assist in the victory.\nBoth of his points came as a result of intelligence and his nose for offense. On his assist, Sharp burst into the offensive zone on a 2-on-1 with Patrick Kane, and after Jason Demers collapsed in on him, Sharp sent a saucer pass cross-ice. Kane took that pass and buried it to tie the game back"}

Richard's roundup is great and a sprinkling of ajax never hurt anyone, but from a business perspective the startpage market doesn't seem like an easy way to make money. Russell Beattie and Jason Fried have been speaking a lot of sense on this issue recently - if you're going to build a web application (rather than a market or a piece of social software), you either have to build partnerships, license your software or (gasp!) charge for it.\nThis is another reason why I divide Web 2.0 into social plays and web-based applications. If your application is highly social, you might be able to make money on transactions and interactions (ie. LinkedIn, eBay, Cafepress) - essentially creating a social marketplace. But if you've created a web-based application, you're more likely to charge a subscription or license it (Basecamp, Backpack etc). In fact, subscriptions are a good fall-back model when nothing else fits (ie. Feedburner). After that, there's advertising (which is actually a transaction in disguise), selling related goods, \"building a brand\" and all kinds of partnerships and business deals.\nBut sometimes these correlations don't hold: Flickr, for instance, is a social play that makes money from subscriptions (advertising, too, to some extent). So what would Flickr look like with a transaction model? Probably more like Fotolia, but that's a totally different value proposition.\nSo with this in mind, what's the business model for an ajax start page? Since the social element is minimal, I'd suggest subscriptions, partnerships and licensing. Goowy, for instance (which seems to be fairly sound on the business side), will likely add a paid version soon. Whether ajax start pages can support an ad-based model remains to be seen, but Microsoft and Google could probably pull it off. And yes, a few of these new ajax start pages will be flipped to a bigger player (Netvibes, possibly), but those without real business models are unlikely to survive for long.\nSee also: LinkedFeed, Eskobo and Pageflakes."}

Racism they would vigorously oppose if applied in the United States is welcomed in Israel.\nReports at the weekend suggested that Donald Trump is about to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, throwing a wrench in any peace plan. If true, the US president will have decisively prioritized support for Israel \u2013 and pro-Israel lobbies at home \u2013 over justified outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world.\nBut paradoxically, just as American Jews look close to winning the battle domestically on behalf of Israel, many feel more alienated from a Jewish state than ever before.\nThere has long been a minority of American Jews whose concerns focused on the occupation. But until now their support for Israel itself has been unwavering, despite its institutionalized racism towards the one in five of the Israeli population who are Palestinian.\nA Law of Return denies non-Jews the right to migrate to Israel. Admissions committees bar members of Israel\u2019s Palestinian minority from hundreds of communities. A refusal of family reunification has torn apart Palestinian families in cases where one partner lives in Israel and the other in the occupied territories.\nMost Jews have justified to themselves these and many other affronts on the grounds that, after the European holocaust, they deserved a strong state.

They have donated enormous sums, helping to build cities and plant forests. And they have lobbied aggressively at home to ensure diplomatic, financial and military support for their cause. But it is becoming ever harder for them to ignore their hypocrisy.\nThe rift has grown into a chasm as Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government widens its assault on civil rights. It now targets not just Palestinians but the remnants of liberal Jewish society in Israel \u2013 in open contempt for the values of most American Jews.\nThe peculiar catalyst is a battle over the most significant surviving symbol of Jewishness: the Western Wall, a supporting wall of a long-lost temple in Jerusalem.\nJews in the US mostly subscribe to the progressive tenets of a liberal secularism or Reform Judaism. In Israel, by contrast, the hard-line Orthodox rule supreme on religious matters.\nSince the 1967 occupation, Israel\u2019s Orthodox rabbis have controlled prayers at the Western Wall, marginalizing women and other streams of Judaism. That has deeply offended Jewish opinion in the US.\nTrapped between American donors and Israel\u2019s powerful rabbis, Netanyahu initially agreed to create a mixed prayer space at the wall for non-Orthodox Jews. But as opposition mounted at home over the summer, he caved in. The shock waves are still reverberating.\nAvraham Infeld, a veteran Israeli liaison with the US Jewish community, told the Haaretz newspaper this week that the crisis in relations was \u201cunprecedented\u201d.

If the Steelworkers really insist on strong environmental moves during contract talks, ``then we have the most powerful partner we could hope for,'' he says.\nThe second phase, according to Mr. Sheehan, involves planning so that future plants will run cleanly - so cleanly, in fact, that workers will never again have to choose between jobs that pollute or no jobs at all.\nThe union's environmental push isn't coming just from the top. Several union locals are moving in a similar direction.\nAt Uniroyal Chemical Ltd. in Elmira, Ontario, for example, striking steelworkers are demanding wage protection during environmental shutdowns and job protection for environmental whistleblowers. The company laid off some 60 workers earlier this year when new emission limits forced the closing of a pesticide-producing plant.\n``It's new ground for us,'' says Leo Gerard, the union's Ontario district director. Whistleblower protection could make every steelworker an environmentalist, keeping tabs on a company's environmental practices, he says.\nUnion locals in northwest Indiana are also setting up environmental committees and becoming more environmentally aware, says Bruce Nissen, a labor studies professor at Indiana University Northwest in Gary. That will improve the public image of the union, he says changing it from a narrow interest group to a progressive organization.\nOf course, these long-term gains can't paper over the potential job losses unions face as environmental controls are tightened.\n``We in labor are probably in the toughest position'' on environmental issues, says Jay Power, an AFL-CIO lobbyist. During the Clean Air Act deliberations in the US, the AFL-CIO charted a middle course between employers and environmentalists - disagreeing with environmentalists on a second tier of auto emission standards, disagreeing with industry on air-toxics provisions. Mr. Power says the labor movement broadly supported those provisions, even they may eliminate some 15,000 to 20,000 mining jobs, many of them unionized.\nThe Steelworkers face the same dilemma. The industry's old coke ovens, for example, are heavy polluters and will be hit hard by the air-toxics provisions. The union's top leadership supports these, but some local leaders are wary that coke plants will have to close."}

He laughed off the occasional heckler, repeated riffs from last year and appeared far more at ease when going after Democrats in front of adoring crowds than trying to push through his own legislative agenda from the confines of the White House.\nTrump\u2019s aides are making a renewed push to get the president out of Washington. The capital is consumed with the investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election and Trump\u2019s firing of his FBI director, James Comey.\nIowa, with its large share of independent voters, could be a proving ground for whether Trump can count on the support of voters beyond his base. Unaffiliated voters, or \u201cno party\u201d voters as they are known in Iowa, make up 36% of the electorate, compared with 33% who registered as Republican and 31% registered as Democrat.\nSelf-identified independents in Iowa voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 13 percentage points last year, according to exit polls conducted for the Associated Press and television networks. That margin helped Trump take the state by nearly nine points after Barack Obama won it the previous two elections.\nTrump held a Des Moines rally in December as part of his transition-era \u201cthank you\u201d tour of states he had won, but has not been back to Iowa since.\nHe avoided any discussion of the scandals surrounding his presidency, other than one brief reference to the \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d his term for the inquiries into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia."}

{"idx": "14356", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Elections are decided by who votes -- and increasingly, in America, by who cannot. Barriers to voting participation skew policy outcomes and elections to the right in the United States. One of the most racially discriminatory of these barriers is felon disenfranchisement. Nearly 6 million Americans are disenfranchised due to felonies.\nThis may seem like a small share of the population, but the concentration of disenfranchisement in some states makes it enough to shift elections. In six Southern states -- Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia -- more than 7 percent of the adult population is disenfranchised. Unsurprisingly, given the racial biases in the criminal justice system, the burden does not fall equally across racial groups. In the most definitive research, Christopher Uggen, Sarah Shannon and Jeff Manza find that \u201cone of every 13 African-Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than non-African Americans.\u201d New research suggests this is skewing democracy.\nIn a new study, three economists find that felon disenfranchisement has a significant impact on congressional elections -- enough to swing between one and four House seats in favor of Republicans in the 1998, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 elections (the numbers vary based on the model and election). The authors, oddly, argue that because these elections would not have changed which party held the House majority, disenfranchisement doesn\u2019t matter for aggregate political outcomes. But research suggests that close elections have long-term impacts because incumbents tend to be re-elected. In addition, even seemingly modest things like vote margin can affect how elected officials vote. At a time when laws are passed on razor-thin margins, every House seat matters.\nAnother study on felon disenfranchisement finds a key divergence in 2000. Author Edward Burmila finds: \u201cDisenfranchisement rates no longer bear a significant relationship to crime rates, and states won by Republicans have both lower overall turnout and higher levels of ineligible felons in the voting-age population.\u201d His work does not speak to causality, but the results are jarring: In states Republicans are winning, an increasingly large share of the population are disenfranchised (see chart below).\nBurmila's work suggests that, much like voter ID laws, felon disenfranchisement is seen by Republicans as a way to create a more favorable electorate with little or no public backlash. Recognizing that cuts to early voting are unpopular, the GOP has increasingly pursued strategies intended to narrowly target low-income people and people of color.\nThe implications are dire, not just for democracy, but for society. Research shows that voting helps ease transition back into communities for citizens returning from incarceration. By depressing turnout in poor communities, felon disenfranchisement can influence the way public spending is distributed. Another recent study finds that allowing immigrants to have voting rights reduces the chances they will commit crimes.\nMore can be done to increase turnout among formerly incarcerated individuals who are eligible to vote. Outreach campaigns have proven successful at increasing voter participation among formerly incarcerated people. In Iowa, a 2005 executive order automatically restored rights for those leaving prison (rather than requiring individuals to submit a request to the governor).

Though Dany is arguably more violent in her methods, they do have similar goals: create a better world for their people.\nJon does this by focusing on their best interests, while Dany goes about doing this by breaking the cyclical wheel of houses trading power over and over so that civilians can stop paying for their house's wars.\nIn the past season of Game of Thrones, the two fan-favorites finally met in the Targaryen castle: Dragonstone. Jon came seeking help against the White Walkers, while Dany accepted him in while seeking more allies in Westeros.\nInitially, the two butted heads. However, by the end of season seven, the two had fallen in love. Fans had been interested in the pairing for a long time, but now they finally came together.\nThis doesn't mean that the two don't have a lot of complications, though.\nDany and Jon have a lot of confusing, nonsensical aspects of their speedy romance. The Mother of Dragons and the King in the North may finally be together, but it hardly means that everything's perfect.\nWith that said, here are the 25 Things That Make No Sense About Jon Snow And Daenerys' Relationship.\nIn a world of complex drama, political subterfuge, and conversational etiquette, Daenarys and Jon's first interactions are oddly rom-com-esque.\nThough the directors and actors worked to show the chemistry between them from first glance, they also started their relationship off with icy distrust and forceful demands.\nThis is despite the fact that both parties greatly benefit from an alliance and they both know that.\nMore logically, they would have made an alliance, but stayed distant from one another.\nHowever, events and time might have brought them closer and eventually to love. It simply doesn't make sense for the two respectable royals to act out a \"hate turns into love\" rom-com plot thread.\nThough fans have been imagining a Dany/Jon pairing for years, the timing for their romance couldn't possibly be worse. Just as the most terrible adversaries threaten Westeros, they are giving each other long looks and taking reckless risks for love.\nMoreover, it's poorly timed because many fans theories were naming Jon is the \"Prince That Was Promised.\" He will stop the White Walker invasion.\nAlso, fans theorize that Jon will have to stop the invasion by repeating history: stabbing his wife and turning her into a Walker.\nThis would mean beloved Dany might become a White Walker, a terrible fate for any character.\nTheir romance's timing makes no sense, or it makes the worst kind of sense.\n23 Jon Calling Her \"Dany\"\nFans may call Daenerys \"Dany\" as an easy nickname, but in-story, the name holds little affection.\nThe only person who called the powerful woman this name was her brother, Viserys.

Such devices protect residents from flooded yards and America's largest rodent, the beaver, from death traps.\nThe device will also act to lower the water level by six inches to help eliminate flooding, Maccagnano said.\nWorkers place the pipe through the beavers' dam, then repack material around the pipe, effectively putting the dam back together, because beavers will plug it back up again, he said.\n\"When the beavers go out there tonight, they'll know something is wrong, so Mike Callahan broke a little hole in the dam. They won't be concerned with the pipes - they'll be concerned with the hole, they'll be busy plugging the hole,\" Maccagnano said.\nMeanwhile, beavers get comfortable with the piping, he said.\n\"If the beavers are occupied, they kind of go with it,\" said Maccagnano.\nIn Holliston, like many MetroWest communities, an \"explosion\" in the beaver population has resulted from a law enacted in 1996 prohibiting body-grip death traps, resulting in bigger and better beaver dams - and lots of flooding.\nThe Legislature has since given local boards of health the authority to grant permits to alleviate beaver-related problems that pose a threat to public health or safety.\nTo avoid killing the beavers, officials hired Beaver Solutions, of Southampton, to find more humane ways to deal with flooding and problems associated with beavers' dam-building, Maccagnano said.\nNative Americans greatly respected beavers partly due to their ability to significantly alter habitat to suit their needs, according to Callahan.\nThey have a highly organized social structure, and young beavers appear to play and wrestle with younger siblings, and improve their building skills by watching parents and older siblings, according to Callahan. Beavers are typically timid, peaceful and social animals with strong family structures, he said. Though their dam-building can create problems, beavers also provide benefits to humans, the environment and endangered species, Callahan said.\nBeavers help people by recharging drinking water, removing pollutants from surface and groundwater, decreasing erosion, protecting areas from drought, and decreasing damaging floods, according to Callahan.

Today approximately 2/3 of the WEEE is not handled by producers and falls outside the treatment requirements of the Directive.\nSays Luigi Meli, CECED Director General: \u201cWe welcome progress in some areas of the EP report. However some key issues have been missed. If policy makers want to resolve the problems of WEEE then they must ensure that treatment requirements and reporting obligations cover all WEEE, not just the WEEE handled by producers.

Producers have no authority over these actors that collect WEEE for economic reasons to make a profit of its value. Neither can enforcement authorities require that these actors treat WEEE in accordance to the WEEE Directive as these actors are not addressed by the Directive. This problem will increase in the future given the growing scarcity of resources and the resulting increase in material prices.\n\u2022 In comparison to the original Commission proposal, the European Parliament has opted for an improved collection target based on the amount of WEEE that generated.

I mean, other than some free time thanks to my favorite food-related holiday. Workplace frustration. Having a temper tantrum or going on a rant dripping with sarcastic \u201cthanks for all your help\u201d isn\u2019t very professional, but, if you\u2019re anything like me, you can\u2019t keep that frustration in forever. Here are a few tips for letting out your inner rage monster at work without getting fired.\nWalking is my go-to activity to let out frustration. Whenever I feel like my brain is about to explode with all of my NSFW, angry words I go for a 15 to 20 minute walk. Not only does this allow for some me-time, but it removes me from the office environment. A lot of the time my frustration is elevated by having to sit in a cubical all day. Sometimes a bit of fresh air is all I really need. Plus, I get a baby work out in during the work day.\nAnother thing I love to do is write out all my feelings. I\u2019m a writer by nature, so putting my feelings on paper feels therapeutic for me. It\u2019s a good way to expel the words and phrases running around in my head without hurting anyone\u2019s feelings, or my career. After I\u2019m finished writing everything I want to say I rip up the paper. Part of this is because it\u2019s good to symbolically be done with negative feelings, and part of it is so no one reads what I wrote. Okay, if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s mostly the latter.\nGetting frustrated is perfectly human. We\u2019ve all been annoyed with friends, family, electronic devices that seem to never work, etc., but we don\u2019t rage quit those. Don\u2019t let a normal human emotion ruin your job for you. Sometimes when I\u2019m feeling particularly frustrated I take a deep breath and list (in my head obvi) my favorite parts of what I do. I LOVE editing and writing, so I just focus on those things.\nI seriously doubt your boss wants you to be a frustrated, miserable blob of a human, so if you\u2019re repeatedly feeling frustrated about some aspect of your job shoot your boss an email and set up a time to chat. Personally, I think it\u2019s best to do this in person; it\u2019s really more of an in-person convo. Just like you have to work at relationships, you have to work at finding your groove at work. Don\u2019t be afraid to, respectfully, tell your boss what\u2019s not working for you. Sometimes a simple one-on-one can alleviate some of your frustration.\nIf all else fails, take a page from Anna Nalick\u2019s book and breath, just breath.\nHave something else that you do when you\u2019re frustrated? Let me know in the comments! And, as always, have a fabulous day!"}

The question is no longer \u201cshould I use AR at my business?\u201d but \u201cwhat kind of AR will work best?\u201d The answer to that is different for everyone.\nAugmented reality (or AR) is an increasingly hot topic at the moment, thanks to the rapid pace of new technologies and the fact that we all carry AR-ready devices around in the form of our smartphones. There was a time when AR software was sluggish, unintuitive and quite frankly ugly to look at. People didn\u2019t use it because they didn\u2019t like it.\nBut those days are over, as is evidenced by the exciting new technologies that are popping up all over the world. Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds allow users to translate into different languages on the fly just like the Babel fish in Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Pok\u00e9mon Go had more first week downloads from the Apple App Store than any other app in history and still has 65 million monthly active users.\nSo, it\u2019s pretty clear, then, that augmented reality isn\u2019t some futuristic new technology but rather one that\u2019s in the here and now and just waiting to take over. In fact, applied correctly it has a number of different use cases which can drastically improve your business and its overall productivity and profitability. Here are just five practical ways that you can do just that.\nOne of the most obvious ways that AR can be used is hinted at by Pok\u00e9mon Go. Many physical businesses witnessed a surge in sales when the app came out, only to discover a few days later that they were a designated Pok\u00e9Stop and that people were stopping by to play the game and making purchases while they were at it.\nI\u2019m not saying that you need to use games, though. Physical shops can use augmented reality to enhance the in-store experience with additional content. They could add augmented reality assistants to provide a more personalized shopping experience without hiring extra staff, or they could hide virtual Easter eggs and create treasure hunts as part of seasonal promotions.\nBrands have always been big on creating experiential events in which people gather at a real world location to interact with them. At its most basic level, we\u2019re talking about having a stand at an industry event, while more advanced experiential events are often turned into viral videos, like the \u201cPush Button to Add Drama\u201d advertisement for TNT.\nAugmented reality allows brands to take the idea behind experiential events and to deploy them on mass to anyone who downloads their AR app. We\u2019re yet to see a real breakout success so far, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t happen if you nail the creative and the storytelling. In the meantime, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t find a way to deliver cool content that reflects your brand. Imagine if Red Bull allowed you to see tiny parkour runners racing around your living room.\nNot all products sell themselves. In today\u2019s service-led economy, more and more companies are branching out into complicated products that are difficult to explain and therefore difficult to sell. Augmented reality could provide a way to solve this quandary by showing these solutions in a way that people can understand, a little bit like a more engaging version of the classic explainer video.\nAR comes in particularly useful if you have a physical product because it allows you to \u201cshow\u201d it to people in a setting that\u2019s familiar to them. Still, if you create a software product or offer a service, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t find a clever way to make AR work for you.\nThis one\u2019s a particular favorite amongst fashion brands and"}

Tolkien.\nLearn the story behind the popular tales of Winnie-the-Pooh in this feel-good film. 'Goodbye Christopher Robin' stars Margot Robbie, Domhnall Gleeson and Kelly Macdonald.\nOn paper, the life of a writer, even that of a world-famous icon, doesn\u2019t seem overly cinematic. For those whose pen actually is mightier than a sword, the works often overshadow the personality.\nStill, Hollywood\u2019s got a fever for classic authors, especially those of British lineage. Goodbye Christopher Robin (in theaters Friday in New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Washington, expands to additional cities through October) tackles Winnie-the-Pooh creator A.A. Milne, while The Man Who Invented Christmas (out Nov. 22) shines a seasonal light on Charles Dickens. And the upcoming Tolkien is the life story of The Lord of the Rings scribe J.R.R. Tolkien.\nPrevious prestige films about similar bygone-era writers have found awards-season success: Finding Neverland (2004) snagged seven Oscar nominations and one win (for original score) with Johnny Depp as Peter Pan playwright J.M. Barrie, and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger received a Golden Globe nomination for her role as The Tale of Peter Rabbit author Beatrix Potter in Miss Potter (2006).\nThe key to keeping these potentially dry true-life stories creative and exciting for a modern audience is \u201cjust trying to find the moments that made these people,\u201d says The Man Who Invented Christmas director Bharat Nalluri.\nTolkien, with Nicholas Hoult as the purveyor of Middle-earth lore, will focus on how friendship, romance and battle inspired the author\u2019s fantasy epics. Like Tolkien, Milne (played by Domhnall Gleeson) was a World War I veteran; Christopher Robin showcases how the author grappled with PTSD and struggled with personal connections, only to befriend his young son (Will Tilston) and hatch the world of his renowned children\u2019s books.\nInhabiting a man haunted by the ghosts of war is what challenged Gleeson the most, \u201creading about how shut off a person can feel to the world and keeping that interesting enough to watch,\u201d the Irish actor says. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing, being able to take you back to a place that your mind wasn\u2019t able to cope with.\"\nThe Man Who Invented Christmas also has biopic elements but it\u2019s more a fantastical look at Dickens\u2019 creative process, his desperate need for another literary hit in 1843 and the whirlwind six weeks he had to write A Christmas Carol.\nPlayed by Dan Stevens, the wild-eyed Dickens goes on his own time-traveling journey alongside Ebenezer Scrooge (Christopher Plummer) while reflecting on his life through the ghosts of Christmases past, present and yet to come when hurrying to finish his holiday masterpiece.\n\u201cI would like to think that if Charles Dickens was around to watch this film, he\u2019d enjoy it because it\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s mad like he was,\u201d says Nalluri.\nHe adds that A Christmas Carol and Winnie-the-Pooh have stood the test of time partly because"}

According to the Board bylaws, if a member misses sufficient meetings without cause, he or she can be suspended or removed.\nAlso, there are several issues regarding parking. One of them may have the Board looking at restricting parking at the OB Pier and at the lot at Dog Beach to 4 hours. The Board is to review the impact of unrestricted parking at these two lots and possibly request the city to install signs limiting parking to 4 hours. If passed, this would be the first move to limit daytime parking. Unrestricted parking could be more of an issue at the Pier.\nThe other parking issue includes city reps presenting ideas of Shared Parking Agreements.\nIn addition, the Board will review recent developments about short term vacation rentals and possibly take action.\nWhat in the world is happening to the beach town I hold so dearly??? Limits at parking lots? I and many others spent many hours per day surfing and lounging on the beach.\nVacations rentals?? Who is going to be left in OB other than tourists and the privileged few?\nWake up people and VOTE against the elitists.\nUnfortunately same thing happening in tons of other communities.

Thank you OB Rag for helping me to keep up to date on very important issues.\nI\u2019m hesitant to push for any changes there. Yes, limits would certainly make it harder for people to squat and live there for 20 hours a day.\nJohn makes a good point on the pier lot, more turnover means more people can use it and go to the businesses. Sometimes when I\u2019ve been to La Jolla cove I\u2019ve just turned around and left because there\u2019s no parking. But isn\u2019t the 2 hour parking on the commercial blocks enough? I could see having just a few of the spots in the lot changed as a trial run. Or maybe just have some 15 minute spots for unloading. Either way it has to be well marked.\nThere is no need for a limit at the dog beach lot, there is no businesses over there. And despite the campers I\u2019ve never had to wait long for a spot. Also I guarantee you some of those residents nearby are using it, I used to be one of them.\nAs for meters/fees/passes\u2026. hell no.

Their confidence in the Afghan security forces has risen, but they don't share the U.S.-led coalition's stated belief that the Afghan soldiers and policemen will be ready to secure the entire nation in three years. Others worry the Afghan economy will collapse if foreigners leave and donors get stingy with aid.\nForeign forces began leaving Afghanistan this year.\nAbout 14,000 foreign troops will withdraw by the end of December, according to an Associated Press review of more than a dozen nations' drawdown plans. The United States is pulling out 10,000 service members this year; Canada withdrew 2,850 combat forces this summer; France and Britain will each send about 400 home; Poland is recalling 200; and Denmark and Slovenia are pulling out about 120 combined.\nTroop cutbacks will be deeper next year when an estimated 26,000 more will leave. That figure includes 23,000 Americans; 950 Germans; 600 more French; 500 additional Britons; 400 Poles; 290 Belgians; 156 Spaniards; and 100 Swedes.\nGen. James F. Amos, commandant of the Marine Corps, told the AP that the number of Marines in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan will drop \"markedly\" in 2012, and the role of those who stay will shift from countering the insurgency to training and advising Afghan security forces.\nAmos declined to discuss the number of Marines expected to leave in 2012.\nThere are now about 19,400 Marines in Helmand, and that is scheduled to fall to about 18,500 by the end of this year.\n\"Am I OK with that? The answer is 'yes,'\" Amos said. \"We can't stay in Afghanistan forever.\"\n\"Will it work? I don't know. But I know we'll do our part.\"\nAdditional troop cuts or accelerated withdrawals are possible.\nMany other countries, including Hungary, Finland and Italy, are finalizing their withdrawal schedules. Presidential elections in Europe and the European debt crisis also could speed up pullout plans. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said this week that Australia's training mission could be completed before the 2014 target date.\nBack in June, then-U"}

{"idx": "14402", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Just how does Santa deliver all those presents in one night?\nIT'S a question as old as Christmas itself. Many people have developed theories but only Santa and his elves know for sure.\nI asked my eight-year-old. He said that Santa knows how to stretch time so that he has enough time to travel the world in one night. And when he stretches time, he moves very quickly relative to us and that is why people rarely see him and have never captured him on video. The eight-year-old is big into science and likes to understand how things work so he has asked a lot of questions about Santa over the years.\nI asked my four-year-old and she said that the reindeer can go very, very fast. The two-year-old just said: \"I don't know\", which probably sums up most people's understanding of how it all works.\nSanta has about 32 hours to deliver his presents. As countries directly to the east of the International Date Line are 24 hours behind those directly to the west of the line, if Santa started delivering presents at 10pm on Tonga, travelled west and finished at 6am in the Samoa Islands, that would give him a full 32 hours. But, with about 2.2 billion children in the world, that is still a pretty tall order. So how does he do it?\nDr Larry Silverberg, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University, says that Santa's know-ledge of the space-time continuum, nanotechnology and computer science helps him to complete his task.\nDr Silverberg was head of the first team of scientists ever to visit Santa at his North Pole workshop when he travelled there two years ago. He explains that Santa uses this knowledge of the space-time continuum to form \"relativity clouds\".\n\"Based on his advanced knowledge of the theory of relativity, Santa recognises that time can be stretched like a rubber band, space can be squeezed like an orange and light can be bent,\" Dr Silverberg says.\n\"Relativity clouds are controllable domains -- rips in time -- that allow him months to deliver presents while only a few minutes pass on Earth. The presents are truly delivered in a wink of an eye.\"\nAccording to Danny Maruyama, a systems physics researcher at the University of Michigan, Dr Silverberg's theory is plausible.\n\"While I don't know much about relativity clouds myself, I think it's very possible that a man who flies in a sleigh, lives with elves and has flying pet reindeer could have the technology needed to utilise relativity clouds,\" he says. Ok, but what about all those toys?\nDr Silverberg reckons that Santa doesn't actually carry all the toys in his sleigh, but that he has a 'magic sack', a sort of nano-toymaker that uses a reverse thermodynamic processor to create toys inside the children's homes.\nThe presents would then be grown on the spot, atom by atom, much like DNA can command the growth of organic material like tissues and body parts. And there's no real need for Santa to enter the home via a chimney, although Dr Silverberg says he enjoys doing that every so often.\nInstead, the same relativity cloud that allows Santa to deliver presents can also be used to \"morph\" Santa into children's homes. One thing we do know for sure is that Santa is helped on his way by NORAD, a joint United States and Canadian organisation that monitors and controls the aerospace in that region.\nNORAD uses its ground-based radars and"}

Ombudsmen also provide services to remote sites as well as Community Based Health Care Organizations. Ombudsmen are located at Army military treatment facilities (MTFs) and serve as independent, impartial and confidential advocates between MEDCOM, the Soldier and their Families, and the MTF commander by acting as communicators, facilitators and problem solvers.\nHow do ombudsmen impact warriors in transition?\nSince inception in April 2007, Ombudsmen have assisted nearly 7,000 WT and Family members. Ombudsmen resolve complaints, assist in obtaining accurate information and act as the advocate for warriors in transition and their Families who are faced with complex, often overwhelming issues such as their healthcare, pay, physical disability processing, reserve-component medical retention and transition to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nWhat types of problems do ombudsmen solve?\nFor example, the Family of one wounded Soldier requested he be transferred from Fort Hood, Texas, to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which was closer to their home. Ombudsmen arranged the transfer and the Medical Command's Medical Assistance Group arranged for his mother to receive counseling. The mother of a Soldier with a back injury requested that he receive neurology care. Womack Army Medical Center worked with the Soldier and his Family to schedule a neurology appointment and an MRI scan while he was on leave from deployment in Afghanistan.\nApart from war itself, the care of our warriors in transition and their Families is the top priority of the Army.

This would involve an assessment about whether they were using their diplomatic status as a cover for intelligence or other work.\nIt is understood that garda\u00ed and Irish intelligence authorities have had concerns about some Russian staff for some time.\nMr Varadkar\u2019s statement marked a hardening of his position from the previous evening when the expectation in Irish circles was that Dublin would await the results of an investigation into the attempted poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury earlier this month.\nSenior Government figures said it was the intention to await the results of the investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons into the attack before saying whether it believed Russia was responsible.\nHowever, the Irish approach toughened following discussions over dinner on Thursday night amongst EU leaders, at which British prime minister Theresa May spoke about the result of British intelligence investigations into the events in Salisbury and the substance used.\nAfterwards the EU heads of government adopted a statement declaring that it was \u201chighly likely Russia is responsible\u201d for the the Salisbury poisonings. Mr Varadkar said he and French president Emmanuel Macron had proposed a toughening of the language.\nIreland has rarely expelled foreign diplomats, although the move would not be unprecedented. In 2011, a Russian diplomat was expelled after an investigation found that the country\u2019s intelligence service used six stolen Irish identities as cover for spies operating in the US. Ireland opened the investigation after the US FBI broke up a Russian spy ring in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Virginia.\nIn 2010, an Israeli diplomat was expelled after it was reported that eight members of a Mossad hit team had travelled on fake Irish passports during an assassination in Dubai of a Hamas official.\nHowever, there are concerns in the Department of Foreign Affairs about Russian retaliation if any diplomats are expelled from Dublin."}

Summerfield, of the Stadheim & Grear Ltd. Law firm of Chicago, which represents the company.\nAtlas filed suit Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago against Naperville and its department of public utilities, the latter of which \"provides the municipality's electric utility infrastructure,\" according to the six-page civil lawsuit.\nSummerfield said Atlas invented \"the 734 patent\" and applied for it in January 1993. The patent is \"directed to a reliable, medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless, preferably radio frequency (RF), LAN-type network communications among a plurality of resources\" such as battery-powered, portable computers, the lawsuit declared.\nImplementation of a smart meter system \"avoids the need for meter readers to come to your house or business \u2026 and keeps track of an individual's (utility) usage,\" Summerfield said Tuesday. \"The way (the city) did away with that need is, they put central (data) collectors in different neighborhoods (to) communicate wirelessly with the various remote meters throughout the neighborhood.\"\n\"The central collector will interrogate the meters \u2026 and then they figure out the usage\" of electricity, water or natural gas at a specific home or business, he said.\nSummerfield said \"the patent itself allows a communicator designated as a hub to control and organize communications among remotes, by telling them when they are allowed to communicate to the hub.\" It puts the remotes in a sort of queue, \"so that they are not competing with one another to communicate with the hub\" simultaneously, he said.\nNaperville City Council members this week settled a federal lawsuit filed last winter by a staunch opponent of the city's smart meter installation program.\nIf, for example, a central collector is gathering data from 100 houses, \"it communicates with 100 different, battery-powered, wireless communicators attached to the meters,\" making battery conservation a potential issue, Summerfield said.\nThe central collector \"will instruct the meters \u2026 that it is going to ask for usage information from each one of them,\" Summerfield said. \"So what the hub will do is, make sure it gets the information it needs\" from one remote at a time, with the others in line and conserving battery power by not operating their transmitters and receivers, he said.\nPatent infringement does not require a violator to have prior knowledge or awareness of the infringement, Summerfield said. \"It isn't necessarily a form of theft. It can be (unwitting.)\"\n\"I don't think the city of Naperville willfully infringed the '734 patent,\" Summerfield said. \"I believe that their infringing is one of those instances where they were simply unaware of the patent.\"\nFinancial compensation is usually made \"in the form of a reasonable royalty,\" Summerfield said. \"At this point, we don't have enough information to say what the damage award would look like.\"\nNaperville legal director Jill G.

The US President claims having dialogue with Pyongyang is next to impossible.\nMeanwhile, negotiations between South and North Korea led to a major breakthrough on Wednesday as the two states agreed to march under a unified flag at the upcoming 2018 Winter Olympics.

In the end there is a suspicion about peace and on the part of the US. I think President Trump somehow believes that this pressure approach is something different than has been applied before, which it isn\u2019t. In reality he wants to pull back some of the thunder, if you will, back to Washington, because you have again the North and South talking.\nRemember in 2007 they reached very substantive agreements \u2013 the two sides of Korea.

Is it to try and create some perpetual tension? Is it the useful thing for the US?\nES: The perpetual aspects of this conflict are the continued state of war, which is very financially lucrative for people. There are billions and billions of dollars of weapons involved. There are tens of thousands of US troops, and bases, and posts, and naval fleets, and everything else around Korea. Without that conflict the whole dynamic in North-East Asia changes.\nI think the US is a little \u2018Jekyll and Hyde\u2019 its policies.

On the other hand, it pumps up this rhetoric and doesn\u2019t support the very impressive aspects of the North and South meeting and what that could possibly mean for peace. So the motivations relate to finances, they relate to geopolitical factors of the US power in the region, if you will.

Greene County voters cast their ballots for change -- a trend that was carried through in the majority of state and national races as well. When the dust had settled and the votes were counted, the local Republican Party was in control of all but one of the 10 courthouse elected offices. The exception was Democrat Shelby Meurer, the treasurer, who was not up for election this cycle. Incumbent Democrat officeholders in the assessor (Nancy Snellenberger), recorder (Rita Hennette), clerk (Jackie Winstead) and coroner's (Brian Gainey) offices as well as District 3 County Commissioner Bart Beard were all defeated. The only Democrat winning in a contested local race was incumbent Shelia Workman, who topped Donnie Johnson for the Center Township Trustee seat. The lone Democrat incumbents who were re-elected were unopposed County Councilmen Brent Murray and John Wilkes. The Democrats hold a 4-3 partisan edge on the County Council and have two of the three county commissioner seats. The Republicans had unopposed candidates Sheriff Terry Pierce and Prosecutor Jarrod Holtsclaw re-elected to four-year terms. Republican County Councilman Ed Michael was unopposed in the General Election. Few of the contested local races were close, other than the coroner's race, which saw Sherry Wilson winning by 364 votes over incumbent Democrat Brian Gainey. The other races were settled by at least 772 votes or more. GOP District 3 Commissioner-elect Rick Graves scored the largest victory margin by defeating two-term incumbent t Beard by 3,654 votes, which was 646 votes more than the entire number of votes that Beard received. It was a day when 50.17 percent (10,099) of the 20,128 registered voters went to the polls or cast absentee ballots. Republicans cast a significant number more straight tickets than their Democrat counterparts by a 1,502 to 836 margin. There were also six straight ticket ballots cast for the Libertarian Party. Greene County Republican Chairman Otto Prow was very satisfied with the way the election turned out. He said the local GOP hasn't had this many county office victories in the last 26 years. Prow said his party fielded some good candidates. \"The voters sent a message,\" Prow said. \"1984 was the last year we won nearly every race. \"I think we had good candidates. They worked hard and they went out to see people on that one-on-one basis and I think that helps. And, they had a message. Each one had a message about what they were going to do ... that's what you have to do and tell the people.\" Prow stressed that the ball is in his party's court now. \"I told the candidates that I want them to learn everything they can before the first of the year. I want them to treat people with respect when they come in there (courthouse), if they have a problem, try to solve it. It's good to win. We've been on a lot of ends that we didn't win. Most of us know how that is. The way to keep winning is to do your job and save tax dollars and respect people that are coming into the different offices,\" he told the Greene County Daily World.

But we are up from 122 pounds a year in 1970 to 150-170 pounds a year in the late 2000s. The average (meaning some people are eating more) is three times what it should be. And compare that to the 7-8 pounds a year we ate in the 1700s (though obviously wealthy people had access to much more than that, while poor people probably got none), and in just a few hundred years of human history, well, Houston, we've got a problem. If we keep going at the rate we have been, our diets will be 100 percent sugar by 2606.\nOf course that last stat is a bit silly, but taking all the information into account, it begs the question: Are we a nation of sugar addicts? If anything but slight decreases seem well-nigh impossible, if, despite wreaking havoc on our health (and teeth!), we still can't seem to get the sugar-plum fairy off our backs, maybe we should just admit that the sweet stuff is (at least mildly) addictive \u2014 and do something about it.\nThe chorus of anti-sugar activists is growing and getting louder, and they are suggesting that we might want to start treating sugar as a drug, just like alcohol and tobacco \u2014 and we may even want to regulate it as such.\nDr. Robert Lustig, a medical expert at the University of California, San Francisco, has written several papers, including The Toxic Truth About Sugar and Fructose: It's 'alcohol without the buzz' and he lays it out in no uncertain terms: \"The definition of addicted is that you know it's bad for you and you can't stop anyway, like heroin, cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. You know it's bad for you. You know it will kill you. But you can't stop anyway, because the biochemical drive to consume is greater than any cognitive ability to restrain oneself. There are two phenomena attached to addiction: one's called tolerance, the other is withdrawal. It turns out sugar does both of those as well. If a substance is abused and addictive and it contributes to societal problems, that's criteria for regulation,\" Lustig told Vox.com.\nLustig obviously feels strongly about the subject, and while some of his critics say his demonization of sugar is overblown, people also pooh-poohed the idea of cigarettes as problematic too.

It's thickened by pureeing a few cups of the cooked vegetables and stirring them back into the pot \u2014 one of my favorite ways to thicken a soup because it's so simple. It also avoids dulling the soup's flavor, which is the problem that crops up when flour or cream is used to do the job. Afterward, you'll stir in some fresh lemon juice as a brightener. This is another of my favorite soup tips.\nThe pancetta makes its appearance as a supporting player, not the star of the show. If you'd like, you can swap in bacon instead.

And you're welcome to leave out the pork altogether.\nThe dumplings are comfort food and making them is, as mentioned, a fail-safe proposition.

Its main appeal? The use of stem cells to repair damaged skin!\nLovingYou: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about stem cells in the news the past few years, and they\u2019re at the root of Lifeline. For anyone who\u2019s a little concerned when they hear the words stem cells, can you explain what they are and how they\u2019re used in your products?\nDr. Simon Craw: A stem cell is a special type of cell integral to early development and tissue regeneration. Stem cells contain a large number of fundamental proteins called growth factors that are needed for the proper development of the body\u2019s organs and tissues.\nLifeline Stem Cell Skin Care products extract proteins, peptides and growth factors from non-embryonic, human parthenogenetic stem cells which were first developed by the International Stem Cell Corporation. These stem cells are created from unfertilized human eggs. No viable embryo is destroyed in the creation of these cells, so there are no ethical complications.\nLY: So why exactly are stem cells good for our skin?\nSC: Stem cells are usually dormant in our bodies; they go to work when they detect injury and recognize the need for repair or regeneration. That\u2019s their purpose in life \u2014 to repair damaged tissue. The stem cell extracts in Lifeline Stem Cell Skin Care help detect damaged and photoaged skin cells and stimulate the skin\u2019s own abilities to repair itself. Stem cell extracts also help to increase skin thickness, therefore making the skin less vulnerable to premature aging.\nLY: What kinds of results have you seen in company tests so far from people who\u2019ve used the products?\nSC: A clinical study was conducted by Bioscreen Clinical Services. The regimen included daily use of both Lifeline Defense Day Moisture Serum and Recovery Night Moisture Serum. Through the eight week clinical trial, subjects saw smoother, brighter and healthier-looking skin.\nLY: Do you see this use of stem cells taking off with other brands?\nSC: Absolutely. Stem cells are very much a buzzword in skin care today. Most of the skin care brands that are using stem cell extracts, though, are plant-based \u2014 they\u2019re derived from apples or melons or rosebuds. While those may have value as antioxidants, they can\u2019t recognize the need for skin repair. Lifeline Stem Cell Skin Care is the only skin care line currently on the market utilizing human, non-embryonic stem cells for anti-aging benefits. Someday, probably, there will be lots of products based on human non-embryonic stem cells. To date, though, Lifeline is the only one.\nLY: What\u2019s the best skin care advice you can give to women looking to prevent aging?\nSC: Remember that quote that circulated in cyberspace in 1997, attributed to a commencement address by Kurt Vonnegut? The most memorable piece of advice was this: Wear sunscreen."}

But \u2014 the politicians and government types who howl the loudest, who deny that they cooperated or protest that they were misquoted, they never sue.\nOdd? Not really, not if you know that Woodward\u2019s practice is to tape all his interviews (with the knowledge and consent of the interviewed), then secure his notes and recordings in a vault, or perhaps with his attorney. To await future review by scholars or whomever. Or for airing in court in the event of litigation.\nFederal accounts will benefit from the taxes Woodward will pay on the millions in royalties he almost certainly will earn from Fear, thus both the Treasury and the author can thank the subject, or the target, of the book.\nFor it is Mr. Trump himself, who will have helped push sales of the dead tree volume ($30) and its e-book version ($14.99) by whetting the reading public\u2019s appetite for it. A new Woodward title almost automatically enters the commercial stratosphere; this latest effort seems destined to threaten the orbit of the International Space Station.\nOne week after the first excerpts of Fear were disclosed, which was one week before its official publication date, Mr. Trump was still raging about it, Tweeting about it, denying its accuracy, even its origins.\nAnd owing to the fact that there had been no formal White House news briefing in almost three weeks, press secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders was compelled to endure question after question about the book\u2019s more arresting assertions: that the president\u2019s own chief of staff and his senior Cabinet officers were dismissing him as a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201can idiot,\u201d with an infant\u2019s attention span and a pre-adolescent\u2019s grasp of foreign affairs, defense issues as well as domestic policy.

Profitable since its first year, Zoho said in a briefing that it had steady revenue growth of 38 percent year-over-year for the past five years.\nThat could be changing as Zoho ramps up its marketing efforts including a big TV campaign during this year\u2019s NBA playoffs. But company officials are quick to note that it sees innovation and its unique approach to development as the real keys to its success.\nA good example is Backstage, an application for running events that includes everything from ticketing, to marketing to virtual viewing so you can join an event online at any time.\nZoho has been using Backstage for its own events and plans to release it soon for inclusion in the Zoho One suite.

The company has started to work with partners in specific vertical segments, such as construction and manufacturing, and letting them resell customized versions of Zoho apps under their own brand at whatever price they want.\nOne company already doing this is Kava CRM, an Australian firm that sells its namesake sales application for insurance brokers that is based on Zoho\u2019s own CRM application.\nArtificial intelligence plays a big role in Zoho\u2019s application efforts. In March Zoho introduced Zia Voice, a Siri-like digital assistant for Zoho CRM.

{"idx": "14455", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Can you use junk to keep your home decor fresh?\n(ARA) - As colder weather arrives, you are probably looking to freshen up your home decor. While it might be counterintuitive, a great way to do this is by using items you might not otherwise have a need for - or to put it bluntly, junk.\nYou may have already heard about a growing trend called \"junking,\" which involves incorporating junk in your home decor. This allows for imaginative self-expression, endless possibilities for original design, and the ability to make your interiors stylishly green. Another plus is that you'll save a little green too, since you won't be buying as many new items.\nSue Whitney knows a thing or two about breathing new life into things some would consider junk. She's been leading the trend for the last decade, founding the premiere junking website www.junkmarketstyle.com and appearing on NBC's The Today Show as the junking expert. Whitney has also written three instructional books on the topic.\n\"Integrating junk in your home decor is not confined to flea market decorating,\" says Whitney. \"I love flea market shopping, but there are countless other spots sweet on junk. Salvage yards, used restaurant supply stores and farm sales are just a few of the many alternatives.\"\nThe right products and tools are essential for crafting unique junk projects. Hammers, nails and super glue are good essentials to start with, in your junker's toolbox. Gorilla Super Glue is the perfect adhesive if you are looking to embellish your finds with other objects. For creating projects and other project fixes, the original Gorilla Glue works well.\n* A little repositioning of furniture and accessories, a change of accent color, and a few new junk acquisitions or creative projects will take you down the transition highway quickly and easily. For example, tightening up your conversation pits will make your rooms seem cozier. You can achieve this by simply moving your furniture a bit closer and adding a few extra accessory junk pieces. When it's cool outside, the closer, the better.\n* Vintage pillows and throws are staples in the junking world. Trade in your light and bright cotton throws for ones with autumnal colors and cozy wool. Accent pillows with contrasting vintage textiles on either side will take you directly from summer to fall with a single flip.\n* Thoughtfully combining colors and textures is a key element in cultivating good junk design. Trends for the season are all basic and neutrals. Galvanized metal, warm woods, whitewashed architectural salvage and weathered concrete pieces provide a stunning and timeless backdrop for your home.\nFor projects and more creative junking ideas from Sue Whitney, visit www.gorillatough.com."}

You do not specify MET values for this calculator, for it calculates this value itself as a side effect.\nAlso I can calculate a correction factor for your metabolic rate. However, as you have said in the past, your metabolic rate had slowed down. So this factor may not be applicable to you. This factor may for you be less than one. This means the calculated calories may be less than what is normally calulated using MET values specified for a particular activity. I think this may be true for you. This factor remains the same for you in all MET calculations. This may be worth a try.\nJust take the MET value for your activity, multiply the MET value by your weight in kilograms. This represents the calories burned in one hour. Then from there calculate it for your duration of the activity. This is very simple. There is a website that gives MET values for literally over one thousand activities. I believe the values have been verified. The correction factor can make for more accurate results which is a simple as using this value to multiply with the calories obtained from the MET calculation.\nLast edited by Tucson; 10-10-2018 at 03:22 AM.\n@Tucson - Thanks.

Our focus is on enhancing the agent environment as well as achieving efficiency,\" he says.\nThe University of New South Wales\u2019 digital strategy director, Nicola Dorling, agrees that bots won\u2019t replace humans but they will take the repeatable work that is measurable.\n\u201cWith the governance of bots being measured through key performance indicators and reconciliations of data, it is important to understand when it is more appropriate to use a bot than a human and I think getting the mix right is essential,\u201d Dorling says.\nUNSW's Dorling: Bots won\u2019t replace humans but they will take the repeatable work that is measurable.\nSimon Blainey, head of customer experience technology at Capgemini, says getting governance right is a challenge that will only become more complex as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are rolled out.\nThe default position would be that any introduction of bots should still meet particular business outcomes and be done so in accordance with existing risk, legal and governance frameworks and policies, he says.\nGanesh Thyagarajan, director at Automation Anywhere, says organisations are setting up centres of excellence to effectively manage governance and govern the roll out of bots.\n\"Simply put, these centres are the ecosystem to ensure robots and humans are managed effectively within an organisation and this ecosystem provides a layer of compliance and governance internally when deploying a digital workforce,\" says Thyagarajan.\n\"There are specific bot frameworks, execution levers, and standard operating procedures that are built by, and within, these centres. Various levels of governance at specified frequencies are followed structurally with the centres and that includes the sponsors, delivery heads and other executive decision makers.\"\nThere\u2019s a significant demand for AI to play a role across all market sectors. Blainey cites Capgemini research which suggested that 58 per cent of Australian consumers prefer interactions enabled by a mix of artificial intelligence and humans.\n\u201cWhat will become even more complex is how data is gathered and cleared for use for machines to learn from and how the inherent bias of humanity can influence the machine. When AI uses flawed data to learn from in order to make decisions that will have an effect on a human\u2019s life or rights, the governance and frameworks need to be closely designed, implemented and monitored,\u201d he says.\nCapgemini's Blainey: Getting governance right will only become more complex with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.\nRod Apost"}
{"idx": "14463", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The House is scheduled to vote on the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act (H.R. 1542), sponsored by Representatives Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and John Dingell (D-MI), on February 27, and the airwaves and papers are filled with ads both for and against this legislation. With each side claiming to be for competition and against monopolies, these ads probably leave most Americans more mystified than educated about what the bill would do. Behind the confusing debate lurks an important decision affecting the next phase of the Internet revolution--the deployment of high-speed, or \"broadband,\" service. Though far from perfect, H.R. 1542 would constitute a small first step toward reducing government barriers to investment in this service area and ensuring that Americans have quality access to the Internet.\nWhy Broadband Service? The terms \"broadband\" and \"high-speed telecommunications\" refer to technologies that rapidly transmit large amounts of information--ranging from \"cable modem\" service provided by cable television systems and \"digital subscriber line\" (DSL) service provided over telephone lines to satellite and other wireless connections. There is no uniform definition of the speed required for this service. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines as \"high speed\" any connection that can transmit data to a user at 200 kilobits per second (kbps) or faster, compared with the standard Internet rate of 56 kpbs. Others argue, however, that the minimum should be much higher--1 megabit per second (Mbps) or more.\nThe speed is important to consumers. At 200 kbps, a Web page can be loaded in roughly the time it takes to turn the page of a book. A song that would take over 10 minutes to download with a standard connection would take about two minutes with a 200 kpbs connection and about 24 seconds at 1.5 Mbps. Similarly, downloading a 20-second video clip would take an hour with a standard connection but two minutes at 1.5 Mbps. And with enough speed, all sorts of things are made possible, from simple Web browsing to downloading whole programs, perhaps even downloading entire movies. Total benefits to consumers and producers could be substantial: as much as $500 billion annually according to one study.\nConsumers seem to be moving toward faster connections with some eagerness. According to a recent FCC report, there were some 9.6 million high-speed subscribers in the nation as of last June--up 36 percent since the beginning of 2001 and 250 percent from the year before. Despite a massive financial meltdown in the telecom sector over the past year, advanced services are still being brought to market.\nNevertheless, there is room for concern. First, the FCC's numbers are based on its relatively loose definition of \"high speed.\" And very few subscribers have speeds fast enough for some of the most attractive applications, such as full-length video. Second, while the agency found broadband service subscribers in 78 percent of the nation's Zip codes, one in four of those areas had only one service provider. Finally, some argue that the rapid broadband growth to date may soon slow as the easy areas to deploy become fewer, leaving only the most difficult and expensive areas to introduce service.\nLimits on requirements that the Bell companies and other incumbent telephone companies (local exchange carriers, or LECs) provide competitors with access to network elements used for high-speed data.\nBroadband Competition. These provisions have raised a firestorm of debate"}

Some of those new arrivals have committed \u201cgruesome acts of violence,\u201d like the Tunisian man who smashed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in 2016, killing 12 people. To prevent more outrages, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer now wants to toughen our borders and give authorities the right to turn away any asylum seeker who is already registered in another European Union country, has previously been denied German residency, or has no papers. Seehofer is from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, and his position reflects the CSU\u2019s harder line on immigrants. Merkel has so far rejected Seehofer\u2019s demands, arguing that they breach EU rules on freedom of movement and would place an unfair burden on southern EU nations such as Italy and Greece, where many migrants land.

These are called \u201cfifth freedom\u201d routes, referring to the \u201cfreedoms of the air,\u201d a set of foundational principles for commercial aviation agreements between countries. The fifth freedom is the right for an airline to stop in a country other than its own and pick up passengers before continuing on to another destination (usually in a third country).\nBeyond the novelty of these flights, they can provide unique opportunities for travelers, including a larger aircraft and/or higher level of service, lower fares, and/or better award availability.\nHere\u2019s a few examples of fifth freedom routes that provide unique opportunities for frequent fliers.\nProbably the most comfortable way to travel across North America, this 6-hour flight on a Boeing 777 is a steal with Alaska Airlines miles \u2013 17,500 miles in Economy, 20,000 in Premium Economy, 25,000 in Business, and 35,000 in First.

Fuel cells use hydrogen, natural gas, methane or other fuels to produce electricity through an electrochemical process that produces a fraction of the emissions of a typical power plant.\nAbout six types of fuel cells are being developed or already are on the market, and they often are divided into two camps: \u201clow temperature\u201d cells that rely on hydrogen and \u201chigh temperature\u201d ones that can use other fuels"}

In that 1996 piece, Mroueh refers to some records of medieval Muslims\u2019 expeditions to the West, which could perhaps have gone as far as the Americas. But the \u201cmosque on a hill on the Cuban coast\u201d that Mroueh quoted from Columbus, and to which Erdo\u011fan referred, seems to be a misquotation. In that quote, which is available online, Columbus does not write about a mosque. He writes about \u201cbeautiful mountains ... one of them containing on its summit a protuberance in the form of a handsome mosque.\u201d In other words, he just likens the shape of a hill to a mosque.\nWhat this means is that, first, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s advisor who gave him this note about Columbus did not do a good job. A reference that can be found just with a simple Internet search, but can also be checked and refuted by an additional Internet search is not the sign of meticulous speech writing.\nIt is also true that even if Muslims did not discover the New World, they discovered other things that were exported to the West. Some of these can easily be traced today in English words with Arabic roots. A short list that I also gave in my book (Islam without Extremes) includes algebra, alchemy, alkali, almanac, amalgam, alembic, admiral, alcove, mask, muslin, nadir, zenith, tariff, sugar, syrup, checkmate, lute, and guitar.\nWhat I want to say is that the Islamic world, indeed, was quite advanced when compared to other civilizations, including the West. The era from the 7th to the 13th centuries, especially, can be easily branded as the golden age of Islam.\nToday, pious Muslims such as Erdo\u011fan can be proud of this past. But first they should get their facts right, and come across as accurate rather than propagandist. They should also think about why that golden age ended, and the Islamic world gradually stagnated, to ultimately become dramatically backward when compared to the West, if not also other cultures.\nThey can begin by comparing the open-mindedness and cosmopolitanism of medieval Muslim pioneers to the dogmatism and xenophobia that dominates the Muslim world today."}

Nothing much has happened in the policing world here in South Yorkshire has it?\nThe Hillsborough Inquest verdicts; three chief constables in a week; the Police and Crime Commissioner elections and more calls for an inquiry into the events at Orgreave 32 years ago. However, I think these issues have been saturated with opinion from all quarters in the last few weeks. So what is important to my members, the rank-and-file officers?\nWe all joined the Force to help the public, keep them safe and lock up the bad guys.\nTo support us in performing our duties we need two things. Firstly the British policing model is that of policing by consent, and has been since Robert Peel created the Metropolitan Police in 1829.\nWe cannot be successful if we do not have the support and confidence of the public we police. One would think that SYP may have lost this. So far I have not seen any evidence though within our communities.\nSecondly, we do not operate independently of each other. We need an infrastructure to support us with the right resources when we need them; the guidance of policy and local, national priorities to work towards. This includes every member of police staff in the organisation and of course our senior command team to lead, support, empower, develop, set vision and purpose.\nIt\u2019s this latter part that is missing, as there is no continuity of leadership.\nI have mentioned the three Chief Constables in a week. What a farce, through no fault of the individuals concerned. I have spoken to the interim Chief Constable, Dave Jones, and he is aware of the Federation views on the current situation.\nHis intent is to do what any new Chief Constable would do, review the force and set up a long-term strategy so the permanent Chief can hit the ground running. I just hope the new CC sees the worth in this and does not start the whole process again.\nIts not just the Chief Constable post that is a concern. We have had a recent change in Deputy Chief Constable and in the last three years we have had six Assistant Chief Constables. Our finance director, is now covering that role in Humberside Police as well, while we also share an HR director.\nWe know nothing is constant and change is part of life and society, but we do need some consistency of leadership to support the vital role of policing this county."}

In the past, research on toxins like this has led to some pretty amazing drug discoveries.\nThe skin of the golden poison dart frog, Phyllobates terribilis, secretes a deadly poison that might lead to a better understanding of how to treat malfunctions of the human nervous system.\nThe golden poison dart frog is about an inch long and banana yellow. By some estimates, the skin of one little frog contains enough toxin to kill 10 adult men.\n\"Oh yeah, it's one of the more lethal poisons on the planet,\" says Justin Du Bois, a synthetic chemist at Stanford University.\nThe substance is called batrachotoxin (buh-TRAK-uh-TOX-in), and tiny amounts of it can be deadly if it makes it into a victim's bloodstream. It's what some indigenous groups in Colombia's lowland rain forest would use to tip their blow darts.\nAnd, as Du Bois and his colleagues write Thursday in the journal Science, they figured out how to make it in the lab in 24 steps. Why on Earth would anyone want to do that?\n\"Well, it turns out it's a fantastic research tool for figuring out how nerves conduct electricity,\" Du Bois says, \"and we're very interested in that fundamental process.\"\nOnce inside a victim, the compound embeds itself in certain proteins that are responsible for conducting electrical impulses through the nerves and muscles, including the heart. By disrupting that process, it can cause paralysis and a heart attack. But studying the poison's mode of action could also lead to a deeper understanding of the role electrical impulses play in fundamental processes like heart function and the sensation of pain.\n\"There are very few molecules like this that we're aware of,\" Du Bois says, \"and we would like to really understand how it works.\"\nAnd maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 some version could be developed into a useful drug. Du Bois points out a few rare diseases that involve malfunction in the same proteins that this toxin acts on; one such disorder prevents a person from feeling any pain at all.\n\"You could literally run a knife through their hand and they wouldn't feel a thing,\" Du Bois says. Some of the same proteins are involved in a condition that's sometimes called \"Man on Fire syndrome,\" because people who have it experience frequent pain and burning.\n\"Molecules like batrachotoxin are essentially a key into mechanisms of how our nervous system works,\" says Toto Olivera, a biochemist and neuroscientist with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute who is based at the University of Utah. The more specific the compound is, and the more potent, he says, then \"sometimes, the greater the insight that you can gain.\"\nThere's a long list of nasty toxins that, with a few tweaks in the lab, have proved useful for human health, Olivera points out. Take curare, for example. The poison from tropical plants is now used as a muscle relaxant during some kinds of surgeries.\nOlivera's lab found that the venom that certain sea snails \u2014 Conus magus \u2014 use to paralyze fish also acts on an important mechanism in the human body's communication of pain.

Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell responded in February by directing that all part-time state employees work 29 hours or less to avoid the 30-hour threshold.\nBecause community college adjunct professors are contractors, not state employees, they're paid by the class load they carry; they don't punch a clock. And, because they're contractors, they are also ineligible for retirement benefits or unemployment compensation should they find themselves jobless.\nIn translating the governor's directive into terms applicable for higher education, Virginia Community College System Chancellor Glenn DuBois limited adjunct teachers to seven credit hours in the summer and no more than 10 each in the fall and spring semesters.\nThe bottom line is that no Virginia adjunct professor at a community college can earn more than $17,000 a year before taxes when the changes take effect in a few weeks, said J. Gabriel Scala, an adjunct English professor at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, which serves the Richmond area.\n\"I love teaching. I wouldn't do anything else. I've never anticipated getting rich off being a teacher. But the rent has to be paid and I have to eat and gas has to be put in the car, and $17,000 a year isn't going to do it,\" she said.\nShe organized a Facebook group of Virginia community college faculty concerned about the change.

What's upsetting -- and dangerous -- is all the hours being cut,\" said Scala, a 41-year-old with a master's degree in creative writing, a doctorate in English and an opportunity to teach full time this fall at a university.\n\"Many adjuncts work at more than one community college.

These outbursts have created a public-relations pitfall for the Palestinian cause, but they also highlight what may be the central motivation for the attacks: US policy in the Middle East.\nThe Middle Eastern origins of the attacks remain a matter of speculation, but US officials have identified Saudi militant Osama bin Laden as their main suspect. Authorities in Boston have identified five Arab men as suspects, and have seized a car at Logan Airport containing Arabic-language flight manuals, according to a report in yesterday's Boston Herald.\nAt the same time, regional leaders from Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi have condemned the attacks and sympathized with the victims.\nMany Muslims and Arabs have been alarmed by Mr. bin Laden's emergence as a suspect. Sheikh Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the leading cleric of the majority Sunni sect of Islam, yesterday added his voice to a chorus of outrage. \"Islam is a religion which rejects violence and bloodletting,\" he said in a statement reported by the Egyptian state-run news agency.\nBut analysts of the Middle East say it is likely that bin Laden acted in concert with other groups and perhaps with the acquiescence of one or more governments. If this scenario proves true, they envision a multitiered US retaliation that would target several entities across the region.\nIf the attacks on New York and Washington are indeed a reaction to US policy in the Middle East, the next phase of the crisis may presage a widening conflict between the West and the adherents of Islam.\nCritics of the idea of a \"clash of civilizations\" are reluctant to concede that such an era is upon us. Nonetheless, says Middle East scholar Rosemary Hollis, \"the likelihood has increased over the past 24 hours.\" Abdel Monem Said, director of Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, says the attacks and their aftermath will add \"to the existing tension between Islamic countries and the West in general.\"\nMs. Hollis, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, says she never bought the theory, advanced in the late 1990s by Harvard University political scientist Samuel Huntington, that global conflicts would arise between different cultures. \"Now, I think it has elements of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" she says.\nSecretary of State Colin Powell, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and other leaders have contributed to the impression that the New York and Washington events constitute \"an attack on civilization,\" as former NATO commander Gen.

Based on a short story by Rachell Ingalls, Ryan Redford\u2019s first feature is a strong item that\u2019s probably too small and spare to gain much theatrical traction. But familiar-face leads (particularly from TV) should guarantee some broadcast and VOD exposure in various territories.\nShot in Ontario, the pic doesn\u2019t specify its time, location or the war its male principals fought in. But then Sherman (Garret Dillahunt) seems cut off from such specifics; he\u2019s drifted, never really belonging anywhere or to anyone, ever since a yearlong hospital recovery from a battle wound that left a metal plate in his head. Having taken a bus from \u201cthe city\u201d and walked the rest of the way, he simply shows up unannounced one day on the doorstep of Franklin (Donal Logue), who saved his life, and won a medal for it.\nFranklin is now a rural mill worker married to Irene (Molly Parker), raising two very young children. Into this domestic setting comes Sherman, for whom normal life is both an unreachable goal and a target of disdain. While kindly Franklin takes pity on the guy, clearly a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder, the strange ideas in their guest\u2019s noggin and his occasional frightening outbursts soon set off alarms for Irene. Indeed, Sherman comes to view her as a sort of rival for Franklin\u2019s attention, which he believes he has a superior claim to.

That is a 3.8 percent premium over Pixar's closing price of $57.57.\nThe move highlights what Mr. Iger said was a priority in his short tenure as Disney's chief (he took the job in October): acquiring and creating brand-name properties to deliver whenever and however consumers want.\nBut it also speaks to Disney's flagging animation ambitions, as rivals like Pixar and DreamWorks Animation have thrived.\n\"I want to return Disney to greatness in this area,\" Mr. Iger said, \"and this was the way to do it fastest.\"\nBoth Mr. Iger and Mr. Jobs said a Disney takeover of Pixar, which has created hits like \"Toy Story\" and \"The Incredibles,\" would not threaten Pixar's unusual culture, because Pixar will still be managed independently.\n\"I'm sensitive to what can happen when a company is bought,\" Mr. Iger said. It is important, he said, \"that the Pixar culture be protected and allowed to continue.\"\nAlready there is fallout within Disney regarding the announcement. David Stainton stepped down as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation on Tuesday, but it is expected he will be offered another role at the studio. He did not return a call seeking comment. At Pixar, said a Pixar executive, employees were subdued though many of them had known an acquisition was imminent.\nProtecting Pixar's culture will be left to the two men who, aside from Mr. Jobs, have had the most significant impact on Pixar. The company's president, Edwin E. Catmull, will lead the Pixar and Disney animation studios, reporting to Mr. Iger and Richard W. Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studios.\nMr. Catmull will be one of the executives to review Disney's operations in Burbank and its slate of animated films, which includes \"American Dog\" and \"Meet the Robinsons.\"\nJohn Lasseter, the director of \"Toy Story\" and the dominant creative force at Pixar, will become chief creative officer of the two studios and the principal creative adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, where he will help design attractions at Disney's"}

Now, Google is taking a greater role in helping users search within particular sites. And some of the same retailers and publishers are not happy about it.\nThe results of the search are almost all individual company pages. Google tops those results with a link to the home page of the Web site in question, adds another search box, and offers users the chance to let Google search for certain things within that site.\nThe problem, for some in the industry, is that when someone enters a term into that secondary search box, Google will display ads for competing sites, thereby profiting from ads it sells against the brand. The feature also keeps users searching on Google pages and not pages of the destination Web site.\nAnalysts generally praise the feature as helping users save steps, but for Web publishers and retailers, there are trade-offs. While the service could help increase traffic, some users could be siphoned away as Google uses the prominence of the brands to sell ads, typically to competing companies.\n\u201cGoogle is showing a level of aggressiveness with this that\u2019s just not needed,\u201d said Alan Rimm-Kaufman, a former executive with the electronics retailer Crutchfield who is now an Internet consultant. Google\u2019s aggressiveness, Mr. Rimm-Kaufman said, ignores a user\u2019s desire to reach a specific destination and it costs those Web sites visitors.\nTake, for instance, a situation last week, when users of Google searched The Washington Post and were given a secondary search box. Those who typed \u201cjobs\u201d into that second box saw related results for The Post\u2019s employment pages, but the results were bordered by ads for competing employment sites like CareerBuilder or Monster.com.\nSo even though users began the process by stating their intention to reach The Post, Google\u2019s ads steered at least some of them to competitors. Similar situations arose when users relied on Google to search nytimes.com.\nWhile executives of both The Times and Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive declined to comment, plenty of others assailed Google over what they saw as a heavy-handed approach.\nGoogle said it had not received many complaints directly from companies, but some search-engine specialists were quick to pounce when the company announced its service. Ann Smarty, a search-engine marketing consultant who originated the SeoSmarty.com blog, speculated that the new feature \u201ccould mean bad news\u201d for sites. Other search-marketing specialists echoed her sentiments, and brands began to follow.\n\u201cEventually this could be a huge problem if Google starts throwing this out there to all brands,\u201d said Pinny Gniwisch, vice president for marketing of Ice.com, an online jeweler. Mr. Gniwisch, who is also on the board of Shop.org, an online retail industry group, said Google\u2019s new feature did not appear when users searched for Ice.com, but he said he would object if it did. \u201cThis is essentially giving the customer a way to leave a search for your site,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut as consumers appreciate this more, there\u2019ll be more and more outcry from companies.\u201d Ms. Hoffman said. Consumers who see advertisements on Google when they search The Post\u2019s or The Times\u2019s content might view the ads as carrying the endorsement of those news publishers.\n\u201cWhy would I advertise on those other sites when I could just advertise on Google and piggyback on the equity of the other brands?\u201d Ms. Hoffman said.\nRetailers"}

A day earlier, German weekly Der Spiegel published a story indicating that German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government is considering lifting some initial sanctions, such as travel restrictions, in return for Moscow\u2019s cooperation on local elections in eastern Ukraine. The article made it clear that senior officials want to become more proactive in finding a way out of the stalemate.\nRussia has clearly demonstrated that it will not change its policy toward Ukraine because of the sanctions, and Ukraine has become something of a frozen conflict. Kyiv cannot regain control of the parts of Ukraine under the control of pro-Russian elements, nor can it change the status of Crimea. At the same time, Russia cannot prevent Kyiv from forming close ties with Europe and the United States, nor can it trigger an uprising in eastern Ukraine. Short of direct intervention in Ukraine, Russia has been blocked. And a direct intervention would not be easy or without risk for the operation itself, or Russian interests elsewhere.\nTherefore, it would be surprising if the Germans didn\u2019t search for a way to lift sanctions, in order to normalize bilateral relations with Russia. From Germany\u2019s point of view, the worst case scenario would be a Cold War to its east. The European Union is sufficiently fragile to frighten Germany. A confrontation between Europe and Russia would likely shatter the EU. NATO is the European defence system, but it has responded minimally to this point. Should the confrontation endure and escalate, the United States would use NATO as a vehicle to conduct a containment strategy against Russia.\nGermany needs to hold the EU together because about a quarter of its GDP is derived from exports to Europe. The expectation of countries like Poland, Romania and the Baltics is that Germany would participate fully in containing Russia. Other parts of Europe that have no interest in such a confrontation would pressure Germany to block the American strategy. Germany is forced to infuriate some part of Europe in this situation. Given the fragility of the EU, the pressure of a Cold War could be the final blow to European unity.\nSince the Russians have not capitulated to sanctions to this point, it is unlikely that they will. Therefore, it is in Germany\u2019s interest to defuse the confrontation with Russia, and to do that, they must at least loosen the sanctions, or ultimately eliminate them.\nThere is a basis for a compromise in Ukraine. The Russians want a neutral Ukraine. Kyiv may maintain whatever economic and political relations it wishes, but it must not become part of the Western defence system. What Russia cannot tolerate is Western forces on the Ukrainian-Russian border. That would represent an existential threat to Russia.\nWhile such a presence is a bare possibility far down the road, Russia has learned in its history that bare possibilities can rapidly turn into realities. Therefore, neutralization of Ukraine in terms of defence relations is the foundation of any settlement for the Russians. Other issues such as some degree of autonomy for eastern Ukraine are manageable if Russia gets neutralization.\nOf course, on the list of other things \u2013 far more important than eastern Ukrainian autonomy \u2013 that Russia would want to revise is the growing US presence in the Baltics, Poland and Romania. I\u2019ve written extensively about the century-long commitment of the United States to prevent a hegemon from consolidating the resources of the European Peninsula and Russia. The United States resisted potential hegemons in the two world wars and the Cold War. This is the fundamental geopolitical interest of the United States,"}

But she usually works the Friday after Turkey Day. \"If I have just one day off, I don't want to spend it cooking and cleaning up,\" she says.\nSo she and her husband have established a new tradition: They use Thanksgiving to revisit favorite restaurants near their home in Medford, Mass.

Erik Wright Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Kansas and lead author of the new study.\nAccording to the KU researcher, diagnoses of eating disorders using the DSM-5 fall short because diagnostic criteria were created by experts using a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach, which shoehorns people into overly restrictive, theoretical categories. However, in reality, most people\u2019s eating-disorder symptoms combine in unique ways along a spectrum of severity, and they often co-occur with other disorders like depression and anxiety.\nFor the study, Forbush and KU colleagues Kelsey Hagan, Benjamin Kite, Danielle Chapa and Brittany Bohrer, along with Sara Gould of Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, enlisted 207 participants who completed a three- to four-hour intensive assessment. The paper reports the baseline data, but the authors plan to follow their participants over the next three years to see whether their new system predicts clinical course and outcome.\nThe researchers used statistics to re-create the diagnostic system from the \u201cbottom up.\u201d The first step identifies and groups together related symptoms into symptom dimensions. In the next \u201cstep up,\u201d the hierarchy combines symptom dimensions into sub-factors. The final step combines sub-factors into higher-order spectra. The lowest level of the hierarchy was characterized by 15 factors. At the top of the hierarchy, the authors found a broad internalizing factor that reflected diffuse symptoms of eating, mood and anxiety disorders. Internalizing branched into three sub-factors: distress, fear-avoidance (fears of certain stimuli and behaviors to neutralize fears, including eating-disorder behaviors designed to reduce fear of weight gain), and body dissatisfaction, which was embedded within distress.\nMoving forward, Forbush and her colleagues hope to move the HiTOP method of diagnosing eating disorders into everyday use by clinicians."}

According to her, many of the patriarchal biases that suffuse our everyday existence have found their way into the way mythology is related. Vaidialingam will be handling the theatre component of Mythologies Retold\u2026the female grail, a collaborative artistic endeavour to reinterpret mythologies in search of space for the feminine form.\nThe dance-drama has been conceptualized by costume-designer Sandhya Raman, and features eminent Bharatanatyam dancer Geeta Chandran. The national premiere of the performance will be held today in New Delhi. Over the next six months, the performers will travel to seven cities including Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Bangalore.\nRaman, a National Institute of Design alumnus, has been associated with Chandran for around five years now and has designed costumes for other well-known dancers such as Anita Ratnam, Birju Maharaj and Sonal Mansingh. \u201cThe idea is to question what happens when women are removed from society and the feminine energy is alienated through acts like female foeticide,\" she says. Raman is also the joint secretary at Rasaja Foundation, where she came into contact with the collection of its founder, artist and art historian Jaya Appasamy, which provided the necessary inspiration for the project. \u201cOne encounters a lot of women-oriented themes in the paintings, which deal with the life of women in different states and forms and at different levels,\" she says. The collection is currently housed at the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi.\nOver the years, Raman has worked closely with Chandran to help evolve the danseuse\u2019s trademark look, one that juxtaposes the traditional Kanchipuramsari with a leotard blouse. Many similar improvizations will be on display during the performance. \u201cThe narrative is unique as traditionally, in a Bharatanatyam performance, one encounters Krishna lore or devi lore, or eulogies to the gods and goddesses, or episodes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata or the nayak-nayika bit,\" says Chandran, adding, \u201cbut here we deal with the little-known stories taken from mythology which are part-fictionalized and part-contemporized.\"\nThe performance, which lasts just over an hour, consists of five sections that frequently overlap the boundaries between different art forms like dance, multimedia presentation and theatre. Besides the Bharatanatyam component, the performance also includes soliloquies and dialogues with the goddesses by Vaidialingam. A trained Kuchipudi dancer herself, Vaidialingam is the sutradhar (the narrator) who puts forth a host of relevant questions to the audience, and probes the various goddesses (played by the dancers) about their roles and how the feminine energy has come to be obliterated over the years. As the actors and the dancers are performing, a set of 8-10 paintings from Appasamy\u2019s collection will be projected on to the background.\nChandran and her students have been practising extensively for the past three months.

Airlines are rapidly adding flights, ramping up the number of destinations served non-stop out of Palm Springs.\n\"We have 330 days of sunshine a year,\" said Airport Director Thomas Nolan. \"We have great weather, and we're a golf mecca.\" It's also a mecca among many Bay Area travelers. Not a month goes by without us getting a query about fares to Palms Springs, which lies about 100 miles east of Los Angeles.\nEvents like the Coachella music festival and a vibrant spa and mid-century modern architecture scene have drawn younger visitors to the wealthy desert oasis, which according to one recent article, has helped Palm Springs lose its image as a \"sleepy senior community.\"\nPSP is now served by 11 airlines, including the big three U.S. legacy carriers. The airport typically sees a big boost in wintertime air traffic to accommodate travelers wanting to trade colder climates for milder weather.\nMost recently, JetBlue Airways announced it would operate non-stop twice a week between Boston and Palm Springs in spring 2019. The carrier also increased service to PSP from New York-Kennedy for next year and will operate its lie-flat seat Mint-configured Airbus A321s over the Christmas holiday on the route.\nPSP, being the gateway to resorts, spas and golfing is a unique market when it comes to air travel. Nolan said 70 percent of airline passengers who visit Palm Springs are there for leisure, with Bay Area travelers making up a sizable chunk of those who visit.\nCurrently, two airlines, United and Alaska Airlines, fly to PSP nonstop from the Bay Area, both out of San Francisco. Alaska uses both 737s and A320's on the route while most of United's flights are on those dreadful Canadair regional jets. On November 16, Sun Country Airlines will begin operating twice a week between SFO and PSP using a Boeing 737.\nNew competition has brought down fares-- for example, we are seeing fares as low as $128 roundtrip on January and February flights from SFO.

{"idx": "14533", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: These meetings were supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the ACM Education Board, and the SIGCSE Special Projects Fund. As is typical of this style of committee, however, much of the work of the Task Force took place between the meetings, which were used primarily to allow for the high-bandwidth, focused discussion that is difficult to achieve in online forums. In particular, these meetings allowed the members of the Task Force to reach consensus on several basic principles of operation.\nDesign for an object-oriented approach. In our work, the Java Task Force has been guided by the prospect of an \u0093objects-first\u0094 approach to the introductory curriculum, as defined by in the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Computing Curricula 2001 report [ACM01]. The tools and packages that we have designed therefore emphasize object-oriented design and adopt an object-oriented usage paradigm. At the same time, we have made every effort to ensure that our library packages and tools are usable with other pedagogical approaches.\nAdopt a minimalist strategy. To avoid the proliferation of complex tools that do little to address the scale problems of Java, the Task Force has sought to minimize both the number and conceptual complexity of our packages. There are, for example, only four packages in the ACM collection. These packages, moreover, are specifically chosen to address the high-level problems outlined in Chapter 3. Although the temptation was often strong to provide additional functionality beyond what we needed to solve the reported problems, we chose to limit our concern to those areas that currently constitute stumbling blocks to the effective use of Java.\nPromote flexibility for adopters. Introductory courses in computer science vary widely in philosophy, topic coverage, and approach. For those of us on the Java Task Force, such diversity is a very good thing. We are not interested in defining any sort of rigid standard, but are instead seeking to empower teachers and students by providing tools to extend their reach. To some extent, our design philosophy is aligned with the maxim formulated by the designers of the X Windows System, who sought to provide \u0093mechanism, not policy.\u0094 The packages in the ACM collection are intentionally general enough to support a wide variety of programming styles.\nMaintain conformance with the Java standard. Throughout our design, the Task Force sought to use the standard Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) provided by Sun Microsystems. The only occasions in which we have proposed alternative APIs are those for which there was clear evidence that the existing facilities were not working well at the introductory level. We have also made the ACM packages separable to make sure that no one is required to adopt parts of the nonstandard packages that they regard as unnecessary. For each of the domains covered by the ACM packages\u0097simplified input/output operations, object-based graphics, and the common applet/application framework\u0097there is always an alternative approach that remains within the official Java standard.\nRetain compatibility with earlier releases of Java. In order to be forward-looking and to ensure that our resources remain current for as long as possible, our baseline version of Java will be Standard Edition 5.0 of the Java 2 Platform (J2SE 5.0), which was released under the code name \u0093Tiger\u0094 in September 2004 [Sun04]. We recognize, however, that many institutions will not be in a position to adopt Java 5.0 by the time at which our materials are released, and possibly not for some time to come.

The protesters said they couldn\u2019t watch Confederate monuments fall without thinking of their own statue.\nMcKinley also became a target for anger at President Trump, who has stoked racial tensions with his comments \u2014 including his continued insistence that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the white supremacists who rallied in Charlottesville.\nThe debate culminated in February during a long and anger-filled City Council meeting, when dozens of residents packed City Hall to testify on both sides of the issue.

I'm just going to enjoy this tonight.\"\nHow It Happened: Needing a win to catch up with Oregon in the Pac-12 chase, UCLA (21-6, 12-4) responded to a 68-49 deficit early in the second half by grabbing momentum and coming all the way back to go up 90-87 on a three-pointer by Japreece Dean with 2:18 to go. But the Ducks scored the final three points of regulation on three free throws by sophomore Sabrina Ionescu, and she was the best player on the court in overtime.\nIonescu opened the extra five minutes with a steal, then made a midrange jumper for a 92-90 lead. She drew an offensive foul on UCLA's next possession, and scored again to cap a possession that featured two offensive rebounds by Mallory McGwire. UCLA's two talented seniors, Monique Billings and Jordin Canada, each scored to forge a 94-94 tie. But Satou Sabally capped a 25-point night with a go-ahead fallaway jumper, and Ionescu hit a jumper from the free-throw line for a decisive 98-94 lead. \"We knew they were going to come out and punch us,\" Ionescu said. \"We had to take it, and punch back.\"\nThere was little indication of the drama to come after Oregon opened the game on a blistering pace. Maite Cazorla made three-pointers on the Ducks' first two possession, and Sabally hit from deep on the next trip for a 9-2 lead. Another Sabally three gave Oregon its first double-digit lead at 21-11, and the lead remained 10 at the end of the first quarter, 31-21.\nThe second quarter featured more offense by both teams, and UCLA ended the first half shooting 54.8 percent (17-of-31), yet trailed 57-41 because Oregon had shot 71.4 percent (20-of-28). Sabally and Cazorla combined for 31 points on 8-of-9 three-point shooting in the first half, which also featured the first missed field-goal attempt by Ruthy Hebard in nearly two weeks, ending her NCAA-record streak of makes at 33. \"It"}

The cost of moving Eman from her home in Alexandria into a cargo plane, loading her onto amini-truck at Mumbai airport and then using a crane to slide her customised bed into a specially prepared room on the first floor of Saifee Hospital on Charni Road has come to Rs 83 lakh.\nDoctors, who have already done a battery of tests on her, will over the next month work on reducing water-retention issues using medicines and a protein-rich diet. \"We should be able to cut down 50-60 kg with this alone,'' said Dr Lakdawala. Incidentally, doctors aren't yet sure if Eman weighs 500 kg or more. \"She was weighed five years back and was 330 kg then. Her sister says she is now double the size,'' said the doctor.\nEven the surgery in March will only be the beginning of a long weight-reduction exercise. As her doctor puts it, \"We have worked out a four-year plan for her.'' The plan includes at least two operations, diet plans and physiotherapy sessions. After the surgery, Eman could lose around 100 kilos within the six months that she will spend in Mumbai.\nHer bed being lifted by crane at the hospital.\n\"We will perform a sleeve gastrectomy operation,'' said Dr Lakdawala, who travelled with Eman and her sister Shaimaa from the airport in a truck. In sleeve gastrectomy, the stomach is surgically reduced to about 15% of its original size and ends up looking like a sleeve or tube. She will leave for Egypt thereafter. \"I want to ensure that Eman, who has been bedridden for over a decade, is able to travel back sitting in a business class seat to Alexandria,\" said Dr Lakdawala.\nAfter losing at least another 100 kilos she will return to Mumbai for the second surgery which is a relatively new procedure called SADI (to reduce the intestinal loops). Meanwhile, the Saifee team has reached out to five medical world leaders, including endocrinologists from Harvard University and Imperial College in London, to figure out why Eman is morbidly obese. Results of her genetic tests, which have already been done, will be available in four weeks. \"If it is genetic abnormality, medicines can help,\" said Dr Lakdawala.\nEarlier on Saturday, Eman and her entourage landed at the Mumbai international airport around 3am.

With ESPN\u2019s decision to begin offering an over-the-top package for its service, joining the likes of HBO, the prospect of snipping the cable cord just became compelling for even more consumers.\nAlready, many viewers have begun shifting their viewing to other devices. For starters, the number of video views on smartphones and tablest has more than doubled in the last year, according to the Ooyala third-quarter video index from 2014. The video platform provider predicts that mobile devices will comprise half of all video views later this year.\nThe younger crowd is driving this change, since 18- to 34-year-olds often favor time-shifted and cross-platform TV as well as online video services. Ooyala also noted that Millennials spend about a third of their TV-watching time using laptops or other connected devices, further underscoring the shift away from traditional modes of consumption.\nAll signs seem to point to continued growth in over-the-top services. Over-the-top video revenues are on pace to surpass $10 billion in 2018, up 72% from $5.8 billion in 2014, the Ooyala report said.\nAdditional services like Netflix, on-demand, and even DVRs, are playing a part in fueling this change since they emphasize the convenience factor that has helped drive over-the-top growth. Consider this: 76% of US homes now have a DVR, subscribe to Netflix or use video-on-demand from a multichannel service provider, while one-quarter of homes use two of those services, according to Leichtman Research Group. In addition, 36% of cable customers have Netflix. That compares to nearly half of non-subscribers, indicating the far-reaching usage of the most popular over-the-top offering among both cable customers and cord-cutters."}

Now 20 and living in an assisted living facility, Reinhardt lost an eye and suffered severe brain damage in the accident. The Loxahatchee resident already has received $300,000 from the school district.\nThe bill also allows the School Board to pay $790,000 to Altavious Carter, who broke his neck in a 2005 traffic accident caused by a school bus driver. Carter, now 25, was a 14-year-old freshman basketball standout at the former Summit Christian School when the crash occurred.\nSince the Florida Senate passed the measure 31-5 on Monday, the bill is headed to Gov. Rick Scott for his approval.\nIn Florida, the Legislature must approve any payments over $300,000 \u2014 sometimes less depending when the injury occurred \u2014 before taxpayer-backed agencies can pay people harmed by government wrongdoing. The measures are known as claims bills.\nIn addition to awarding money to the two young men, the Legislature also ordered the Florida Department of Children and Families to pay $3.75 million to Victor Barahona. He was was found near death in a van along Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach in 2011. Sprayed with pesticides, with chemical burns covering his body, he was alongside the decomposing body of his twin sister, Nubia.\nOfficials at DCF admitted ignoring years of evidence of severe abuse and neglect at the children\u2019s Miami home. The adoptive parents, Jorge and Carmen Barahona, are awaiting trial on murder and attempted murder charges.\nFormer state Sen. J. Alex Villalobos, a lawyer who now works as a lobbyist, persuaded the Legislature to combine what had been two separate bills into one measure for Reinhardt and Carter. In his 25 years of watching the Legislature, he said he has never seen it combine two claims bills. Without it, he said it is likely Carter, who in 2010 was awarded $1 million for his injuries by a Palm Beach County jury, would have been forced to wait yet another year, hoping lawmakers would act.\nAttorney Brian Denney, who represented Carter, said he was pleased the bill passed both chambers.

Sometimes a writer might even define a place, as Hemingway did for 1920s Paris. Rarely, though, does a writer create a place. Yet that is what the Indian poet and Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore did with a town called Shantiniketan, or \u201cAbode of Peace.\u201d Without Tagore\u2019s tireless efforts, the place, home to a renowned experimental school, would not exist.\nFor Indians, a trip to Shantiniketan, a three-hour train ride from Kolkata, is a cultural pilgrimage. It was for me, too, when I visited last July, in the height of the monsoon season. I had long been a Tagore fan, but this was also an opportunity to explore a side of India I had overlooked: its small towns. It was in places like Shantiniketan, with a population of some 10,000, that Tagore \u2014 along with his contemporary Mohandas K. Gandhi \u2014 believed India\u2019s greatness could be found.\nAs I boarded the train at Kolkata\u2019s riotous Howrah Station, there was no mistaking my destination, nor its famous resident. At the front of the antiquated car hung two photos of an elderly Tagore. With his long beard, dark eyes and black robe, the poet and polymath, who died in 1941, looked like a benevolent, aloof sage, an Indian Albus Dumbledore. At the rear of the car were two of his paintings, one a self-portrait, the other a veiled woman. Darkness infused them, as it does much of Tagore\u2019s artwork, unlike his poems, which are filled with rapturous descriptions of nature. As the train ambled through the countryside, Tagore\u2019s words echoed in my head. \u201cGive us back that forest, take this city away,\u201d he pleaded in one poem.\nThe son of a Brahmin landlord, Tagore was born in Calcutta, as Kolkata was called back then, in 1861.

{"idx": "14550", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: For over a decade now, Christopher Nolan, whose \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d opens this Friday, has been awing and taunting us with his restless blockbusters. Nolan has directed \u201cInception,\u201d \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d \u201cInsomnia,\u201d and the independent \u201cMemento,\u201d which established his reputation in the summer of 2000. That film delighted everyone from university faculty to teen-agers with customized bongs. Since \u201cMemento,\u201d however, Nolan, though more critically praised than many directors and more commercially successful than most (\u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d is the twelfth-highest grossing film of all time, and its sequel promises to crack the top ten), has been dismissed by many cineastes as slick and quasi-intellectual.\nI think this is because they misunderstand what his films are doing. Nolan\u2019s entertainments, the best ones, anyway, are games. I don\u2019t mean that they resemble puzzles or tricks (though they do that, too), I mean that they are most satisfying when understood as games, not as novelistic narratives. They are contests with rules and phases, gambits and defenses, many losers and the occasional victor, usually a Pyrrhus type.\nNolan may take a dimmer view of human nature than Beckett. His characters fail at failing better. In \u201cMemento,\u201d Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from anterograde amnesia, a disorder that prevents him from forming new memories, which he acquired after his wife was killed and he took a blow to the head. He has spent every day since trying to find the perpetrator. Or so he tells himself. As Leonard\u2019s backstory coalesces, we find, first, that he is being gamed by everyone else in the movie, and, eventually, that he is gaming everyone, including himself. He has intentionally forgotten that his wife didn\u2019t die but, rather, left him (the film even suggests that Leonard\u2019s wife was killed by Leonard himself), so that he can keep investigating the mystery of her murder over and over again.\nLeonard has made his life \u201ca puzzle you could never solve,\u201d a detective says. \u201cA dead wife to pine for, a sense of purpose to your life, a romantic quest.\u201d A loser in the game of life, Leonard has arranged things in his own mind so that he can keep playing but never exactly win. \u201cSo you lie to yourself to be happy,\u201d the detective says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. We all do it.\u201d There is one thing wrong with it, actually\u2014Leonard must keep killing to relive his fantasy.\nBy the end of \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d another wife is dead, a child twice orphaned, mistresses and false diaries have been exchanged, Nicola Tesla has been revivified (by, who else, David Bowie) and has invented cloning, and Angier and Borden have played each other to death and beyond in order to perfect the greatest magic trick of all, the Disappearing Man. All of this for our grubby amusement. \u201cNow you\u2019re looking for the secret, but you won\u2019t find it, because, of course, you\u2019re not really looking,\u201d Michael Caine hisses at us in voice-over. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to work it out.

One local police inspector blamed a fire caused by an electrical short circuit in a makeshift shop.\nOther witnesses said pilgrims began burning and looting roadside stalls after they became frustrated at long delays in gaining entry to the temple site.\nThe procession quickly became panicked and the narrow passage was jammed as crowds surged forward to avoid the flames.\nA local police chief, V N Deshmukh, put the death toll at more than 300 and said that more than 200 were taken by bus to local hospitals, the AFP news agency reported.\nDistrict official Subarrao Patil told Reuters that 250 to 300 people died in the crush.\n\"This does not include the people who may have been charred to death in the shops that have gutted nearby in the fire,\" he said.\n\"People got suffocated in the crush.

People tend to be grossly uninsured on the life insurance side, McNeely said, because they believe they're invincible. They think they can't afford it, and they lack the knowledge about the need.\n\"I've also heard of husbands saying they weren't worried about getting life insurance because 'she's going to get married again,'\" she said.\nKeith Gillies, CFP and CEO of United Wealth Advisor Group, said that when it comes to life insurance, \"people don't understand what an amount does and doesn't do.\"\n\"Five hundred thousand dollars sounds like a lot \u2014 until you do the math,\" he added.\nLong-term care. People also don't understand major risks of not getting long-term care insurance, Gillies said. \"On the financial side, even if you don't go into a facility, what if you need to hire caregiving help?\" he asked. \"And if you have a caregiver spouse, what about the risks to their own health?\"\nPeople simply don't want to face the issue, said Jennifer Alford, president of Creative Financial Partners.\n\"It's too expensive.\" But this depends on your age at sign-up.\n\"It's only nursing-home insurance.\" However, there now many more options, including home care and assisted-living coverage.\n\"I'll never use it.\" There are now return-of-premium options available (e.g., if you pass away without using the insurance, funds can be returned to your family, or your benefit could pass to your to spouse).\nDisability insurance. Most people \u2014 in particular, the young \u2014 believe nothing bad will happen to them, said McNeely. However, according to the Social Security Administration, about 25 percent of today's 20-year-olds will become disabled before reaching age 67.\nPeople are often not aware of certain options, she said, such as the waiver-of-premium rider. This rider covers premium payments if insureds become disabled, thereby enabling them to hold on to the existing policies they've started drawing benefits from.\n\"They don't understand some of the complexities, like how long to pay and how quickly the policy should kick in,\" McNeely said. \"Shorter elimination periods result in higher premium costs, which brings up the importance of having short-term savings for three to six months of living expenses.\"\nBrock T.

Deforestation from the 2009 Station fire is not a likely cause of the bear\u2019s visit, he added.\nOn Tuesday morning La Crescenta residents flocked to an apartment building on the 2300 block of Mayfield Avenue to get a glimpse of the bear thought to be the same one who over the past month has pillaged trash bins and backyard citrus trees, usually late at night. That bear famously pried open a refrigerator in a North Glendale garage several weeks ago to feast on frozen meatballs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a bear [in the neighborhood], but I\u2019ve heard about them,\u201d said Rod Berns, a La Crescenta resident who came to see if authorities needed help carrying the tranquilized bear out, and then stuck around with his daughter, Taylor, to watch events unfold.\nA collection of more than 100 bear-watchers \u2013 half of whom appeared to be members of TV news crews \u2014 crowded Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputies in front of the building. With three helicopters circling overhead and some people sprinting across the street as he was hauled to a truck by officials cradling him in a tarp, the bear \u2014 said to weigh about 400 pounds \u2014 could be forgiven for thinking he had been captured in Hollywood.\nThe bear was ear-tagged and driven to an undisclosed location deep within Angeles National Forest, where Fish and Game officials expect him to look for another source of food.\nHughan said the now-famous meatball incident can serve as an example for homeowners seeking to avoid bear encounters.\nOfficials also suggest people clean out their trash bins with bleach or other materials, store bins inside except for pickup day, and that residents harvest their fruit before other species try to do the same.\nFish and Game Lt. Martin Wall, who led the bear removal effort Tuesday, has said that black bears dislike confrontation.

My family came to Phillips in South Minneapolis, where we encountered different types of violence. There were war vets who blamed us for the war, who would yell at us and threaten us in parking lots, on the street, who screamed that they fought for our people and that we owed them. There were gangbangers and crack dealers \u2013 every neighborhood in the world has bullies, and they were ours, mercurial, lively with friendship and smack talk one second and livid with menace the next. There were straight up racists who hated us for the color of our skin, who believed it was our fault that there were no jobs and no homes, or maybe they just hated anyone who didn't look like them, eat like them, talk like them. And then there was the police, whom I was taught to wave at as a child when they drove by, their cars slow in the tight streets, stand up straight, smile.\nAs I got older, I stopped waving to police cars and firemen. No, I never rolled with a crew, but in the 90s during my very early teen years I did rock the Raiders clothes and caps, mostly because that's what we did back then, and partly, I admit, because I wanted to be feared. I never went looking to beat up anyone, bully anyone. But too often, as a young man I found myself fighting or fleeing from all manners of people who wanted to do me harm for all different reasons. You tire of it. Some young men join gangs, some take up martial arts and boxing. Me, I tried to perfect my swagger, practiced my stoic look, blew my paycheck from my minimum wage job on overpriced sports gear, walked like I belonged. And if something did happen to me or my family or friends, we hesitated to call the police, because too often they threatened us rather than served and protected us. Threatened us with violence, with false accusations, with deportation. For us, if we were victimized by violence from a civilian, calling the police felt like an invitation for round two. And they'd walk away to do it another day. By most standards I was an easy child who didn't get into much trouble despite the circumstances. And still I feared the police \u2013 because they had an almost mythical power, especially if you were a person of color, to make you feel guilty even if you weren't doing anything wrong.

Australia has now slipped into the bottom half of the OECD countries with the highest inequality. The gender pay gap is growing, not decreasing. As CEDA acknowledges, an estimated 4-6% of Australian society continues to experience chronic poverty and deprivation in an affluent society.\nWealth in Australia is highly concentrated, with the top 10% of wealth holders owning 45% of all wealth (Table 1).\nThere is no guarantee of shared prosperity going forward with the many challenges Australia faces including the economic transformation of Asia, technological progress and digital disruption, diversification of the economy, and an ageing population. If we do not adopt inclusive economic and social policies, where will we end up?\nThe current distribution of wealth in the United States is a guide, with the top 5% possessing over 60% of all wealth, and the bottom 50% left to survive on a few percent of the total wealth (Table 2).\nAs Michael Cooney of the Chifley Centre argues, the new level of inequality that is emerging in Australia is not only a challenge to our morality but also a serious threat to our future economic growth.

We can innovate, create new markets and drive security to a new level.\"\nHis enthusiasm was echoed by Intel CEO Paul Otellini, who in a taped message shown during DeWalt's keynote, reiterated Intel's contention that securing connected devices both behind the firewall and in the cloud represents the \"third pillar\" of enterprise computing -- a task that executives at both companies feel they're ready to tackle.\n\"Security will be most effective when it's enabled in hardware,\" Otellini said, adding that his company's vPro chips have programmable defense filters that, when combined with software developed by McAfee (NYSE: MFE), will raise the bar for embedded security throughout the industry and soon pay the dividends required to justify Intel's pricey acquisition.\n\"We've collaborated with McAfee for 18 months,\" Otellini continued. \"We know and trust and appreciate each other. The combination of Intel and McAfee is about providing greater protection by bringing software and silicon together to do the heavy lifting.\"\nBecause the deal has yet to formally close, DeWalt said he would have hold off on any specific new product announcements for now, but promised there would be plenty to behold \"in the next few months.\"\nFor now, enterprise security administrators can test drive its latest endpoint offering, Endpoint Security 9.0, which offers support for a variety of platforms like Windows, Mac and the whole cavalcade of mobile OSs such, as Android, iOS, Symbian and Windows Mobile.\nEndpoint Security 9.0 features antimalware and data-loss prevention (DLP) apps with mobile device management that can be monitored and controlled through its ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) tool.\nThis week it also announced the debut of McAfee for Management of Optimized Virtualized Environments (MOVE), an application that sits on top of the hypervisor and scans virtual-machine-based OSs and applications for security risks and threats.\n\"MOVE looks at these virtual assets and leverages back through the cloud to deliver a 60 percent improvement in performance,\" DeWalt said. \"It means having an architecture to more securely optimize and deploy virtual desktop and mobile environments through the cloud.

Published on May 16, 2018.\nProcter & Gamble Co. has consolidated most media duties for its North American hair-care business with Dentsu Aegis Network's Carat after a review that also involved Omnicom's Hearts & Science, incumbent on most of the business.\nThe move shifts a significant piece of P&G's business from the Omnicom shop, created in 2016 in part to service P&G. But H&S remains on the broader P&G North American media roster alongside Carat. Both won their places in an extensive 2015 pitch process for the biggest U.S. ad spender.\nThe move doesn't include Old Spice hair-care products, which continue to be handled by Wieden & Kennedy as part of a longstanding consolidated creative and media account, says P&G spokeswoman Tressie Rose.\nCarat previously handled media for Aussie, but H&S handled the vast majority of North American hair care, including Pantene, Head & Shoulders and Herbal Essences. The assignment covers Canada and Puerto Rico, plus such areas as search and planning not covered by measured media. P&G of late has moved some planning and buying duties in house\u2014particularly for digital and optimizing existing campaigns.\nMeasured media spending on P&G hair care brands last year\u2014including Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences and Aussie\u2014accounted for $261 million of the company's overall $2.7 billion outlay, or almost 10 percent, according to Kantar Media. Carat picks up duties for around $245 million of that spending, adding to the $16 million it already handled with Aussie.\nPreviously, Carat held around 15 percent of P&G's business, according to a person familiar with the matter, so this win pushes the shop closer to a quarter of the account. A Carat spokeswoman referred questions to P&G, and P&G declined to comment on the percentage breakdown. Hearts & Science declined to comment.\nIn an interview last month, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the hair-care review was prompted by that business taking a broad look at its marketing model. The review wasn't a full-scale pitch akin to what happened in 2015, since P&G and the hair-care business had experience working with both shops, Rose says."}

{"idx": "14576", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: How feasible is a nuclear terrorist attack on the U.S.?\nAmong U.S. counterterrorism officials, it is the ultimate nightmare scenario: al-Qaeda detonating a nuclear bomb in a U.S. city. Osama bin Laden says it is a religious duty to obtain a bomb, and most experts believe that if al-Qaeda were to succeed, the group wouldn't hesitate to use it. Though building even a crude nuclear weapon is time consuming, the wide availability of raw material and scientific expertise means that it is plausible for terrorists someday to get their hands on one. \"The simplest nuclear bomb,\" says Ivan Oelrich, director of the security project at the Federation of American Scientists, \"is very simple indeed.\"\nThe biggest hurdle is getting the material that causes the nuclear explosion. For a basic nuclear weapon, terrorists would need about 100 lbs. of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium (HEU). Fortunately, manufacturing HEU is extremely difficult. Refining it requires vast industrial facilities, top-flight engineers and the kinds of resources available to a government but not to rogue terrorist groups. Unfortunately, many states have already done the hard work, creating 1,800 tons of HEU that is housed at research facilities, weapons depots and other storage sites in as many as 24 countries, according to William Potter, director of nonproliferation studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Of greatest concern is the more than 300 tons of HEU in the former Soviet Union. Some of the material may have already gone missing: since 1991, there have been seven attempted thefts reported of small amounts of bomb-grade material and more than 700 reported thefts of unrefined nuclear material. In Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 1998, Russian intelligence uncovered a plot by employees at a nuclear facility in the region to smuggle out 40 lbs. of HEU for sale on the black market.\nWith sufficient fissile material in hand, a trained engineer could build a crude device without too much difficulty. The most basic design is that of the Hiroshima bomb, which fired two pieces of HEU at each other from opposite ends of an artillery tube. The bomb could be assembled at a basic machine shop and would fit in the back of a truck. If smuggled into the U.S. and detonated in a major metropolitan area, such a weapon could kill hundreds of thousands."}

That doesn't bode well for productivity.\nSilicon Valley is draining away the economy's most precious resource for its own benefit.\nOK, I'd better explain that.\nThe economy's most precious resource is human attention \u2014 specifically, the attention people pay to their work. No matter what kind of company you own, run or work for, the employees of that company are paid for not only their skill, experience and work, but also for their attention and creativity.\nWhen, say, Facebook and Google grab user attention, they're taking that attention away from other things. One of those things is the work you're paying employees to do.\nAs a thought experiment, imagine that an employee who used to pay attention to your business eight hours each day now pays attention only seven hours a day because he or she is now focusing on Facebook during that last hour. You're paying the employee the same, but getting less employee attention for it.\nFacebook is getting that attention - and monetizing it with additional advertising dollars. In short, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is transferring wealth from your company to his. And he's doing it every day, and constantly increasing how much he takes.\nOf course, it's far more complicated than that. Employees are distracted by smartphones, web browsers, messaging apps, shopping sites and lots of social networks beyond Facebook. More alarming is that the problem is growing worse, and fast.\nOne data point from the analytics firm Flurry found that U.S. users are spending more than five hours per day using their smartphones and that the time spent using mobile apps increased 69% in a single year (from 2015 to 2016).\nThe time spent on social networks is also growing fast. The Global Web Indexsays says people now spend more than two hours each day on social networks, on average. That extra time is facilitated by smartphones and apps.\nThese depressed, smartphone-addicted iGen kids are now entering the workforce and represent the future of employers. That's why something has got to be done about the smartphone distraction problem.\nBut wait! Isn't that the same kind of luddite fear-mongering that attended the arrival of TV, videogames and the Internet itself?\nIt's not clear. What is clear is that smartphones measurably distract.\nA study by the University of Texas at Austin published recently in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research found that a smartphone can sap attention even when it's not being used, even if the phone is on silent \u2014 or even when powered off and tucked away in a purse, briefcase or backpack.\nTests requiring full attention were given to study participants. They were instructed to set phones to \"silent.\" Some kept their phone near them, and others were asked to move their phone to another room. Those with the phone in another room \"significantly outperformed\" others on the tests.\nThis paper reminds me of earlier research cited by MIT Professor Sherry Turkle in her 2015 book, Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age. I interviewed her after her book came out, and she told me that simply placing a smartphone on the table near two people talking changes the conversation into a more trivial and less engaging one. She said \"the phone symbolizes that we could be interrupted at any minute\" and so people naturally gravitate to frivolous topics that could be interrupted without consequence.\nSo while a silent or even turned-off phone distracts as much as a beeping or ring"}

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, in a preliminary ruling in a court case challenging the phone records collection, slammed the agency\u2019s efforts and suggested the program violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.\nLeon\u2019s 68-page opinion amounted to a smack down of the NSA program. \u201cI have little doubt that the author of our Constitution, James Madison, who cautioned us to beware \u2018the abridgement of freedom of the people by the gradual and silent encroachments by those in power,\u2019 would be aghast,\u201d he wrote.\nThe review group\u2019s report was more measured than Leon\u2019s opinion, with no overt claim that the NSA programs violate the Fourth Amendment. But the panel also recommended that the phone records data be taken out of the NSA\u2019s hands, and for new restrictions on the ability of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to compel telecom carriers and other companies to disclose private information to the government.\nLeon\u2019s decision, along with the review group\u2019s report, work together to create a huge change in momentum in the debate, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a digital rights group that\u2019s been critical of the NSA surveillance.\nIn the long term, the review board\u2019s report may be more damaging to the NSA\u2019s current mode of operation than Leon\u2019s ruling. The court case Leon is overseeing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is in its initial stages, with the U.S. Department of Justice likely to appeal.\nLeon\u2019s decision seems to conflict with a ruling last month by Judge Jeffrey Miller of the Southern District of California, and it could be many months before the D.C. case is resolved or is sent on to an appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts said.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s unclear what Obama will do with the review boards\u2019 report, with a formal reaction from the White House expected in January. Some news reports have suggested that Obama will reject some of the recommendations. The White House offered little comment on the report following its release.\nBut several advocates of NSA surveillance reform say the week\u2019s events will put pressure on both Obama and Congress to make changes.\nThe two big events of the week have \u201claunched forward the momentum\u201d for reasonable surveillance reform, said Lynne Bradley, director of government relations at the American Library Association, a group that\u2019s long pushed for more privacy protections from surveillance.\nIn addition to Leon\u2019s opinion and the task force report, a group of tech executives met with White House officials during the week to voice their concerns about surveillance.\nAlso during the week, more than 50 groups and companies wrote to congressional leaders urging them to oppose the FISA Improvements Act, a bill sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

It&apos;s an exception, written into federal rules, to the usual \"loser pays\" rules that apply to most lawsuits. Without it, people would be discouraged from suing debt collectors, say the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Board and a group of private consumer advocacy groups in legal briefs filed this month.\nIn doing so, they say they&apos;re attempting to preserve a delicate legal balance between consumers, who sometimes fail to pay their debts, and debt collectors, who occasionally break the law by harassing or threatening consumers who are behind on their bills.\nThere has been a surge in the number of cases filed against debt collectors under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the 1977 federal law that regulates the activities of third-party debt collectors.\nThe one that made it to the Supreme Court, though, could discourage such suits, the agencies say. The case, known as Marx v. General Revenue Corp., revolves around the experience of Olivea Marx, a Colorado woman who racked up student debt and failed to pay it, then was contacted by a debt collector. Marx, a single mother with two young children and a low-paying job, claimed the collector&apos;s vigor went beyond the limits of the law. It called her several times a day, she said, and illegally threatened to garnish half her wages and sent a collection-related fax to her employer. She sued.\nThe court disagreed, finding that the debt collector&apos;s contact with the woman&apos;s employer did not violate the law because it did not specifically mention her debt. The court ordered her to pay $4,543 in costs -- nearly all of which compensated the debt collector for hiring a court reporter and bringing in witnesses.\nIn a typical lawsuit, that wouldn&apos;t be unusual. Ordinarily, the prevailing party in American courts is entitled to recoup the costs of the case -- a venerable legal concept that discourages frivolous suits by making the loser pay, and one which General Revenue Corp. argued was only fair to apply to Marx.\nA lawyer for General Revenue Corp. could not be reached. But in a statement, Mark Schiffman, vice president of public affairs for ACA International -- The Association of Credit and Collection Professionals, a trade group, says having the losing side pay in debt-collection cases \"is a matter of fairness and consistency.\"\nThe association, he says, \"supports the position that the law does not prevent a successful defendant in an FDCPA action from recovering costs, even if the action is not brought in bad faith and for the purposes of harassment.\"\nThe case hinges on the court&apos;s interpretation of how the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to the issue of litigation costs: Consumer groups say Congress crafted an exception for debt-collection cases. Industry groups say it didn&apos;t.\nDebt collectors in the past have had to absorb the costs of cases filed under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) unless the debtor was found to have filed under bad faith or with harrassment in mind.

More time was needed to turn his pain into artistry.\n\"'Cause you don\u2019t know her like I do / You\u2019ll never understand / You don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve been through / That girl\u2019s my best friend / And there\u2019s no way you\u2019re gonna help me / She\u2019s the only one who can / No, you don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve got to lose / You don\u2019t know her like I do,\" Gilbert sings during the chorus. He's talking to a friend that's trying to move him past the hurt.\n\"I can\u2019t forget, I'm drowning in these memories / It fills my soul with all the little things / And I can\u2019t cope, it\u2019s like a death inside the family / It\u2019s like she stole my way to breathe / So don\u2019t try to tell me I'll stop hurting / And don\u2019t try to tell me she ain\u2019t worth it,\" he adds during the second verse."}

The plan, introduced by Councilwoman Suja Lowenthal, would increase the minimum wage to $10.50 by 2017, $12 by 2018 and $13 by 2019.\nBusinesses with 25 employees or fewer and non-profits would have an extra year to phase in the wage increases.\nThe proposal, which still must be drafted into an ordinance and approved again by the council, falls short of the wage hikes recently approved by Los Angeles city and county. Those ordinances raise the minimum wage gradually each year until it tops out at $15 per hour for most businesses by 2020.\nLabor activists packed the Long Beach Council meeting hoping to convince members to follow L.A.'s lead. Many wore t-shirts or held signs calling for a $15 dollar minimum wage. Their remarks were part of more than two hours of public testimony.\nThe city council voted to commission a study to assess the effects of the wage hike on the economy, said the Press Telegram. If the increase appears beneficial, the city\u2019s minimum wage would jump to $14 in 2020 and $15 in 2021.\n\u201cThe gap continues to grow between the wealthy and the poor, and we continue to deal with the impacts of a growing class of residents living in poverty,\u201d said Councilwoman Lowenthal. \"We are represented by a council that finds it very difficult to look away when the disparity can be so vulgar.\"\nThe Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which represents more than 300 unions in the county, praised the move in a statement.\n\"We thank the Mayor and City Council for voting to prepare an ordinance that would lift thousands of workers out of poverty and ensure they are not cheated out of a full day's work,\" Rusty Hicks, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and a co-convener of the Campaign to Raise the Wage, said in the statement.\nIt continued: \"An ordinance that includes a $15/hour wage, cost-of-living adjustment, wage enforcement, and no exemptions is the only way to ensure workers have a secure and stable life to provide for their families.\""}

This is hardly news, given that American Jews have traditionally voted Democratic long before Trump. However, the poll also revealed that just 51 percent of U.S. Jews support President Trump\u2019s approach toward Israel. This is a remarkably low number given the Trump administration\u2019s strong support for the Jewish state on several key issues, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, supporting Israel at the UN and defunding the terrorist-sponsoring UNWRA organization.\nEarlier this summer, a survey by the American Jewish Committee showed that only 46 percent of U.S. Jews supported moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. In the past, most U.S. Jews supported the move. While Republicans and Democrats have always had their differences, Israel used to be the rare issue that enjoyed robust support from both sides of the aisle.\nIn fact, many of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on Israel and security used to enjoy robust bipartisan support.

Two years ago he created the Beatmobile, a traveling exhibit that features a conversation with John Allen Cassady, whose father, Neal Cassady, was the model for the protagonist of \"On The Road,\" Dean Moriarty.\nNow, Cimino said, the Beat Museum has found its rightful home in North Beach, where the Beats stayed up all night, carousing at jazz clubs, writing and seeking new experiences.\nThe sublease at the gallery expires at the end of March; Cimino said he is attempting to secure a permanent location. When he's at meetings, the museum is tended by Brian Gordon, 24, who met Cimino last October in Kerouac's hometown of Lowell, Mass.\nGordon said reading \"On The Road\" made an impact.\n\"It's a call to the road,\" he said. \"Two years ago I drove from Maine to Florida to L.A. up to San Francisco.

{"idx": "14610", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: NOBODY on the Massachusetts political scene has worked harder to broaden his voter appeal than Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. Although he is by his own definition still a liberal, the Bay State chief executive now may appear to some as more of a moderate than during his first gubernatorial term, from 1975 to 1978.\nToday's Governor Dukakis, for example, has gone out of his way to dispel any doubts about his commitment to tougher crime measures.\nHigh on his legislative agenda are proposals for revamping the commonwealth's sentencing structure to ensure certain and evenhanded punishment for wrongdoers, and substantial expansion of state corrections facilities.\nCertainly these moves provide little comfort to any would-be 1986 challengers, hoping to project Mr. Dukakis as soft on crime -- as he was portrayed by conservative Edward J. King, who bested him in the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\nWhile several factors, including strong ties to the business community, contributed to the King victories both in the primary and election, none may have been more potent than his firm law-and-order stance.\nSince regaining the executive chair 21/2 years ago, Dukakis has strongly supported the idea of making Massachusetts safer through better paid, trained, and equipped police. In the process, however, the governor does not appear to have weakened his liberal credentials, since presumably those of all political stripes and parties are for making society as safe as possible.\nIn the waning months of his first gubernatorial term, Dukakis vetoed legislation to raise the state's minimum drinking age from 18 to 19. But like some of his fellow liberals, he has long since abandoned the philosophy that youths old enough to vote are old enough for liquor.\nLast year, despite strong opposition from activist college students, he signed legislation increasing the drinking age from 20 to 21.\nThis action, in effect, was a recognition on the governor's part that his earlier move was a mistake. That is something no public official likes to concede.\nSuch visible Dukakis changes on issues, however, are rare.\nProbably the most conspicuous difference in the two Dukakis governorships is in tone. On the surface at least, he appears less idealistic and dogmatic, and more flexible -- even political.\nMost of his current major legislation was crafted after a lot of listening and often broad-based participation from citizens and experts.\nClearly relations between the governor and state lawmakers, especially the leadership and other key senators and representatives, are much more harmonious than in his first term. Back then he got off on the wrong foot in developing lines of communication, and was strongly resented.\nInstead of putting the heat on lawmakers, Dukakis has been the epitome of patience and understanding. Whether this strategy works, and how well, is subject to debate.\nIt is unrealistic to expect that all the major Dukakis proposals now under consideration will gain passage.

He had to slog along with them through introductory courses in anatomy and physiology, the fundamentals of nursing care, and how to conduct physical examinations, among other subjects. The only benefit of his time in the military that the university conferred was to recognize his basic training by tossing him two credits for phys-ed.\nLloyd, now 39, completed his degree and is on his way to a earning a master\u2019s next year. Those are the kinds of credentials required to get civilian nursing jobs. But it took him longer than it needed to, in part because universities and colleges give veterans so little credit for their military training and experience\u2014even though the skills they\u2019ve learned, in fields like nursing and law enforcement, are in high demand, and even as more are being discharged into a persistently soft employment market. Some 684,000 veterans are unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nGetting so little class credit for so many skills learned on the battlefield has long frustrated America\u2019s military veterans. Now it threatens to delay or derail the education of a growing number of veterans: Officials say they\u2019re bracing for an influx of servicemembers seeking education benefits as U.S. troops leave Afghanistan. More than a million veterans are receiving education benefits, the Veterans Administration reports, which is already up almost double from about 564,000 in 2009, before the military drawdown.\nBut things are slowly starting to change. Lawmakers in Washington state have unanimously voted to make public universities and colleges give academic credit to veterans for military training, and the governor has signed the measure into law. A similar bill is under consideration in Michigan. In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich has proposed requiring that veterans\u2019 experience be taken into account not only for academic credit at that state\u2019s public institutions, but for professional licenses.\n\u201cIf you can drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar, Afghanistan, don\u2019t you think you should be able to drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland?\u201d Kasich asked in his state-of-the-state address.\nIn addition to time, the problem is costing veterans money to pay for courses about subjects they already know, often subsidized by taxpayers through GI Bill benefits that have totaled nearly $35 billion since 2009.\nA new study by the SVA finds that veterans who enroll in college using money from the GI Bill take longer to finish than other students\u2014a median of five years for a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree. Bachelor\u2019s degree candidates generally take a median time of four years and four months, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.\nVeterans often go to school while simultaneously raising families, holding jobs and serving as reservists, all of which can slow them down.

It has endangered fellow Republicans' chances in the 2017 race to replace him as governor of New Jersey.\nWhile Christie's national numbers get more attention these days as he lays the groundwork for a presidential campaign, the governor's home-state approval ratings have slid for some time now. Just a few years ago Christie's charisma and political connections were the best thing the New Jersey Republican Party had going for it, but now it's Democrats who are eagerly preparing to take advantage of Christie's political situation to win back the governor's mansion in 2017.\n\"One of the fundamentals here is that nobody expects a Republican to win in the next gubernatorial election,\" said Ben Dworkin, the director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \"It is widely accepted and assumed that the next governor will be a Democrat.\"\nChristie is barred by state law from serving a third term, though it's unclear if he'd be able to win reelection even if he were able to run. A Monmouth University poll released this week showed Christie's statewide approval rating at just 35 percent.\nEven if Christie were still exceedingly popular, it'd be tough for any Republican to replicate the circumstances, and especially the personal charisma, that enabled Christie's rise. In a sense, the dynamics present in the run-up to the upcoming open-seat race represent a return to the status quo after a unique Christie-led era.\n\"Many Democrats feel confident that Chris Christie was a unique politician and not somebody who's going to be easily duplicated by the Republicans,\" Dworkin said.\nThe Republicans most frequently mentioned as potential candidates are close Christie allies, a tie that likely won't do them any favors in a race that will be fought in his shadow. State Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick has remained loyal to Christie, and he recently hired Christie's former campaign manager, Bill Stepien, who was fired in the fallout from \"Bridgegate,\" to help with upcoming Assembly races. Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, is also said to be considering the race.\nBramnick maintains that his focus is on 2015 legislative races and that he doesn't see Christie as a drag on his party in coming elections. He said he is confident that merely attacking Christie won't be enough for Democrats to win in 2017. \"Those in the Democratic Party, and those who are very partisan, will attack Chris Christie, but it doesn't solve the problems that we face,\" Bramnick said. \"Things like Bridgegate are sideshows.\"\nOther Republicans aren't so confident. One conservative state senator and Christie critic, Michael Doherty, recently told The New York Times that Christie's reputation is \"going to be relevant to the reputation of the statewide Republican Party, and whether a Republican's going to have a shot of being elected governor in 2017.\"\nThe surest sign in the early race to replace Christie as governor, though, is the large number of Democrats already maneuvering to run in 2017.

{"idx": "14626", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: There is a wide spectrum of ways to create new websites, starting with solutions that require no coding at all, such as Weebly and WordPress, all the way to coding your website entirely by hand using a text editor like Vim. ExpressionEngine (various pricing, buy-only) is a serious content management system that sits close to Vim on that spectrum, and has a vibrant community of users and developers.\nThe ExpressionEngine Control Panel is slick and inviting.\nTraditionally, one of the main problems of using a content management system (CMS) such as Wordpress is that your website ends up looking like a Wordpress website. Meaning, no matter how much you play with the graphics, colors and typography, the basic layout of the page often still looks like it was made with Wordpress. ExpressionEngine solves this by being completely open-ended and not enforcing any sort of hierarchy or default layout. In fact, when you first install it, your homepage shows nothing: Just a blank, white page, completely devoid of any markup or skeleton structure. This makes building a new website significantly harder, but it also makes it possible to achieve almost any layout you can think of.\nExpressionEngine has you define your own content types and fields.\nExpressionEngine is aimed at experienced Web developers: Just to get started, you need to upload it via FTP, change file permissions manually on a list of folders and files, create a new MySQL database manually, and then provide its credentials to the ExpressionEngine installer. If you know how to do all of that, and have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, you will probably be able to handle ExpressionEngine.\nThis is not a system you are supposed to just play with until you figure it out, but thankfully, its documentation is excellent. Once you get it installed, you use a slick control panel for creating content and presentation templates, but you still need to code your templates as pieces of HTML using that interface. To embed content into your templates, you will have to use special ExpressionEngine tags, which are clearly explained. There is also an excellent Getting Started tutorial that introduces many of the concepts you will need to get started, such as Channels (pieces of content) and Templates (controlling presentation).\nExpressionEngine uses a combination of HTML and its own special tags for rendering content.\nExpressionEngine is priced to make it easy to get started: EllisLab offers a $100 Freelancer license, which you can use exclusively for building your own website. The next level up is the $150 Non-Commercial license, strictly for non-commercial, non-profit, or educational websites. If your project is commercial, you will need the Commercial license, which costs $300.\nIf you'd like to use ExpressionEngine but don't want to code a theme from scratch, websites such as ThemeForest offer commercial, ready-to-use ExpressionEngine themes. Then again, if you're considering using a ready-made theme anyway, you may be better off with WordPress. It is not as open-ended as ExpressionEngine, but doesn't have its price tag and initial learning curve, either.\nIf you are an experienced Web developer looking for a powerful CMS that allows complete customization, check out ExpressionEngine, but be prepared to spend some quality time with the documentation.\nNote: The Download button takes you to the vendor's site, where you can buy the latest version of the software.\nExpressionEngine is a powerful and complex content management system for professional Web developers."}

{"idx": "14628", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A new Obama administration policy will give low-income high schoolers access to the federal financial aid system.\nThousands of low-income high school students will be able to use federal grant money to pay for classes at local colleges, the Obama administration announced Monday. In a first-of-its-kind move, some needy students will be able to access Pell Grants early to pay for \"dual-enrollment\" classes at 44 public and community colleges across the country. High school students have typically been prohibited from using federal financial aid.\nThe change is aimed at helping to close a longstanding gap between rich and poor students in college attendance and completion. Under the new policy, poor students can get a head-start on their college classes: a chance to begin adjusting to college and transferrable credits that could save them as much as a semester's worth of tuition fees farther down the line.\nMost American public high schools offer students the opportunity to take classes at local colleges through \"dual enrollment,\" and some 1.4 million high school students took the classes last year. But the Education Department says poor students are underrepresented in the programs. That is in part because cost can be a huge barrier: half of students have to pay for the courses themselves, and most have to pay for expensive books and materials.\nThe new initiative will allow as many as10,000 high schoolers who qualify for Pell Grants, the federal government's loan-free financial aid program for low-income students, to access those grants before they matriculate in college.\nIt could have unintended consequences. The Pell grant isn't an unending supply of money: it lasts only six years, the average time it takes most Americans to finish a bachelor's degree. Students who start using their Pell in high school could run out of money before they graduate.\nBut the hope is that taking college classes in high school will help students graduate faster. Research shows that taking dual-enrollment courses in high school helps keep low-income students enrolled in college and makes them more likely to get a degree."}

{"idx": "14632", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There are still many unknowns about the Doklam standoff, what led to it and its de-escalation\u2014some of which will stay unknowns. There also remain questions, including its broader implications and longer-term impact. More immediately, its diplomatic resolution has been rightfully greeted with a sense of relief. Some have suggested that this outcome was inevitable since China and India have dialogue mechanisms, experience dealing with such incidents, and more to lose than gain by conflict. But the risk of escalation is always present in such standoffs. For example, the kind of miscalculation that led to the apparent Chinese belief that India wouldn\u2019t respond to its road construction could have also led to a belief that a limited operation was feasible and desirable.\nResolve: It was crucial for India to stand its ground. For one, demonstrating resolve is effective\u2014even essential\u2014in getting Beijing to back down. As my colleague Ryan Hass indicated (goo.gl/KY4g3H), there\u2019s a pattern to Chinese behaviour: \u201cPush until (they) hit steel, escalate public rhetoric, quietly look for off-ramp.\" Second, it sends a message to Beijing that New Delhi will not accept unilateral attempts to change the status quo. Third, it signals the same to governments in the neighbourhood, region and world\u2014and shows that New Delhi is willing to walk the talk.\nRestraint: Even as resolve was crucial, so was restraint. It wasn\u2019t lost on officials or observers that in other cases, China has used construction to consolidate or extend its territorial claims, and has been cherry-picking which agreements and understandings it will respect. The broader stakes also aren\u2019t hidden\u2014even in May 1962, a US state department assessment noted, \u201cAt issue is not merely a boundary line\u2026but the relationship of the two most populous and potentially most powerful states in Asia to each other and to other Asian states.\" But New Delhi was careful to keep it local, and not allude publicly to Chinese regional behaviour. It also refrained from retaliatory rhetoric which would have escalated the situation, made the off-ramp harder for Beijing to take, and complicated the dynamics between India and Bhutan. Opposition leaders also showed restraint, demonstrating the importance of keeping politics out and them in the loop. Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, such restraint doesn\u2019t make India look weak; it made India look mature enough not to take Beijing\u2019s bait.\nCapabilities: Resolve requires diplomatic, military and other capabilities. Chinese actions during this standoff showed that it was willing to use a number of instruments\u2014diplomatic, military, economic, legal, infrastructure, communications\u2014in its toolbox to pressure India. New Delhi, in turn, needs to ensure that it keeps its own toolbox well stocked. China won\u2019t pressure India at a time or place of New Delhi\u2019s choosing, so there\u2019s no room for complacency. India needs to enhance its capabilities comprehensively and with a greater sense of urgency. Moreover, India\u2019s China strategy will have to involve multiple stakeholders within and outside government, an assessment of India\u2019s vulnerability to Chinese leverage, and expansion of India\u2019s leverage with China.\nPartnerships: Partners shaped the environment, India\u2019s options and, arguably, Chinese behaviour. One partner, Bhutan, was involved as a key actor. We might not know the extent to which Thimphu and New Delhi coordinated, but it\u2019s clear that they did. What is also evident is that Beijing has sought to put pressure on this relationship. India will have to continue to handle this partnership with care, acknowledging that preferences won"}

And Congress may help it.\nAnd Congress may help it.\nA budtender shows cannabis buds to a customer at the Green Pearl Organics dispensary in Desert Hot Springs, California, on Monday, the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in the state.\nOn Thursday, marijuana-hating Attorney General Jeff Sessions invalidated a document that has served as the legal scaffolding for the state-level pushes to legalize recreational use of marijuana. There are, as Mark Joseph Stern writes in Slate, many reasons to believe that some kind of federal crackdown on marijuana could be in the works. But there are also plenty of reasons the legal marijuana industry no longer needs to fear a prohibitionist like Sessions.\nIn his missive, Sessions rescinded the Cole memo, an August 2013 document named for its author, then\u2013Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole. The Cole memo guided federal prosecutors not to expend resources prosecuting state-legal marijuana businesses unless a case met one of eight law enforcement priorities, such as distributing pot to minors or trafficking product across state lines. Within the industry, and in legal practice, it was widely interpreted to mean working or investing in this federally illegal industry did not put people at risk of federal prosecution.\nWith this protection in place, legal cannabis became one of the fastest-growing industries in the country. Sales jumped from $1.5 billion in 2013 (U.S.) to an estimated $10 billion (for North America) in 2017, according to Arcview Market Research. The industry now employs more than 150,000 Americans and has become more deeply entrenched in every quantifiable way.\nWith Thursday\u2019s reversal, Sessions is alerting state-legal cannabis businesses that once again they are fair game for federal prosecutors. But the legal climate has changed so much it probably doesn\u2019t matter. When the memo first came out, Colorado and Washington state had voted to legalize recreational marijuana the previous November, but neither market had opened. No one knew if it would be a disaster. Today, industries operate in several states and have given alarmists almost no fodder for complaint.\nAnd legalization is popular. An October 2017 Gallup poll found an all-time high of 64 percent of Americans support full legalization. The same poll was also the first time Gallup recorded a majority of Republicans, 51 percent, favoring full legalization.\nSessions has sat out this remarkable shift in public opinion. In 2016, he said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d By November 2017, his views had evolved slightly to acknowledge that marijuana is not as destructive as heroin. However, he remains skeptical about the plant\u2019s medical uses and has not shown any outward interest in how much the politics of pot, and the facts on the ground, have changed since the \u201cJust Say No\u201d era.\nInstead, during his first year as attorney general, Sessions has repeatedly tried to clear a path to crack down on the federally illegal drug.\nThis has been more difficult than you might think for the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official.\nThe Cole memo provided \u201cguidance\u201d for federal prosecutors, but since December 2014, a law has been in effect that blocks the Justice Department from spending resources prosecuting state-legal medical-marijuana businesses.

The message read, \u201cea.com/neverbethesame\u201d \u2014 the teaser site.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until May 23 to know for sure the premise behind the next Battlefield, but a March report from Gamesbeat citing anonymous sources correctly claimed it would be called Battlefield V, and said it would be set in World War II.\nA teaser video posted by Electronic Arts appears to confirm the World War II setting. A British flag is visible at the top of the screen for one team, while the Wehrmacht flag appears to be on the other side. The video contains a soldier with a large, old-fashioned pair of goggles on his head, all but guaranteeing the game will take place at some point in the past.\nBattlefield 1 took players to the First World War and achieved great critical and commercial success. It would make sense for EA Dice to head back to World War II with the series for the first time in nearly a decade, seeing as Call of Duty: WWII demonstrated that gamers are still interested in revisiting the well-trodden time period.\nMany fans would probably like the next Battlefield to be a Bad Company title, the comedic subseries that has been dormant since 2010. Although rumors have cropped up over the years about a Bad Company revival, the Gamesbeat report stated that the rumors don\u2019t hold any water.\nThe tagline \u201cNever Be the Same\u201d suggests that anything is possible, though. And perhaps EA will reveal something totally unexpected on May 23.\nUpdated on May 21, 2018 with new teaser video."}
{"idx": "14644", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: New developments in laser technology could see nuclear fusion as a viable power source within 15 years.\nClean, cheap nuclear energy is often touted as a means to battle climate change. But how close are we to having nuclear plants that fit the clean, green bill? What are the different technologies and what do they offer?\nMore than 10 per cent of the world's electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. These existing plants all rely on nuclear fission \u2014 a chain reaction where uranium atoms are split to release extraordinary amounts of energy and, unfortunately, high levels of radioactive waste.\nBut a different type of nuclear reaction \u2014 nuclear fusion \u2014 has been the focus of research to develop nuclear power without the radioactive waste problem.\nNuclear fusion is the reaction that powers the Sun. It involves smashing hydrogen atoms together under extraordinary temperature and pressure, fusing them together to form helium atoms and releasing a large amount of energy and radioactive waste. But unlike fission, this radioactive waste is short-lived, quickly decaying to undetectable levels.\nNuclear fusion happens readily in stars like the Sun, because their cores reach extreme temperatures of over 15 million degrees Celsius, and pressures billions of times greater than our atmospheric pressure on Earth.\nFusion reactors would need to recreate these extreme conditions on Earth, and researchers are using two different approaches to achieve this: tokamak reactors and laser fusion.\nSeparate groups of scientists in Germany and China have recently announced they have made breakthroughs in nuclear fusion using tokamak reactors.\nTokamak reactors use a doughnut-shaped ring to house heavy and super-heavy isotopes of hydrogen, known as deuterium and tritium.\nNormal hydrogen \u2014 which is also known as protium \u2014 consists of a single proton in its nucleus orbited by an electron. Deuterium differs in that the nucleus also contains a neutron, and tritium has a proton and two neutrons in its nucleus.\nThese isotopes are heated to 100 million degrees Celsius by powerful electric currents within the ring.\nAt these extreme temperatures electrons are ripped off their atoms, forming a charged plasma of hydrogen ions.\nAn artist's impression of a cutaway view of the ITER tokamak fusion reactor in operation.\nMagnets confine the charged plasma to an extremely small area within the ring, maximising the chance that the superheated ions will fuse together and give off energy. The heat generated can be used to turn water into steam that spins turbines, producing electricity.\nOver 200 experimental tokamaks have been built worldwide, but to date they have all consumed more energy than they produce.\nA massive international tokamak project \u2014 the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) \u2014 aims to turn that situation around.\nThe ITER is designed to produce 10 times as much energy as it takes to run, becoming the first ever net energy producing fusion reactor. It is currently being built in the south of France, but with the first fusion experiments scheduled for 2027 it will be some time before we know if that goal has been reached.\nIn the meantime, physicists in Germany are using a variant of the tokamak, known as the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator. This uses a twisting ring design with changes in geometry and differing magnetic fields to control the plasma for longer periods of time compared to the short bursts tokamaks achieve.\nLast week, physicists at the stellarator announced they had created a hydrogen plasma using two megawatts of"}

But Menino, the city's longest-serving mayor now in his 20th year in office, joked that longevity should be considered a good thing.\nMenino wields a potent political organization in Boston that could help Markey's get-out-the-vote effort in the June 25 election for the seat formerly held by John Kerry. The mayor's endorsement of Democrat Elizabeth Warren in last year's Senate contest was seen as critical to her victory over then-incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown.\nMarkey attempted to defend himself Friday when asked about a Boston Globe story that said he has missed 40 recent votes in the U.S. House and hasn't cast a vote since May 9.

{"idx": "14653", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What: Shares of Novavax , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of vaccines to treat a variety of infectious diseases, surged by 24% in June, based on data from S&P Capital IQ, due to infectious disease concerns in overseas markets.\nSo what: Though it&apos;s difficult to trace Novavax&apos;s share price increase in June to just a single event, the fact that it&apos;s in the process of doing research into Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, a disease currently without a cure, appears to be enough to boost shareholder interest in the stock for the time being.\nIn South Korea (as of July 1, 2015), 184 people have been diagnosed with MERS, included 33 that passed away and 102 that were cured of the disease. Outside of Saudi Arabia, where MERS is believed to have originated, South Korea represents the largest outbreak. Much like we saw biopharmaceutical companies being rewarded last year for researching Ebola (which Novavax is doing, too), Novavax is likely getting a nice boost from its ongoing research into MERS.\nAdditionally, in a recent company presentation Novavax&apos;s management team announced that four of its clinical trials should be yielding data in the third quarter. These include its seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine, its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine for the elderly, its maternal RSV vaccine for the protection of infants, and its Ebola vaccine. Investors like catalysts, and Novavax is giving Wall Street a big helping in Q3.\nNow what: The $64,000 question that investors need to ask here is whether or not Novavax&apos;s momentum can continue beyond just June. As is common with clinical-stage biotech stocks, that&apos;s not an easy question to answer.\nIn one corner, Novavax&apos;s vaccine development platform is fairly diverse -- RSV, influenza, and a handful of global diseases -- and it&apos;s primed to deliver a number of near-term catalysts. Although we&apos;re only looking at midstage data coming up in Q3, this could be the first glimpse investors and Wall Street get at the underlying efficacy of Novavax&apos;s RSV and influenza products. Novavax has a lot riding on the success of these platforms in Q3 as it could help validate the company&apos;s drug development platform.\nIn the other corner, investors have to keep in mind that Novavax is still a long ways off from an FDA approval and producing recurring revenue. As such, the losses for Novavax are likely to continue for at least the next couple of years. Beyond that, it&apos;s important to keep in mind that vaccines tend to be very hit and miss overall. Vaccine developers require governments around the globe to stock up, and there are no guarantees that demand will be strong enough over the long run to offset the high costs of vaccine development.\nOverall, I consider Novavax watchlist-worthy, but it&apos;s not a company that I believe is primed for investors&apos; dollars as of yet. Perhaps my tune will change following the third quarter, but it&apos;s difficult to get too excited about Novavax when we have only preclinical and phase 1 data to aid in our decision-making process.\nThe article Why Novavax Shares Rocketed Higher By Nearly 25% in June originally appeared on Fool.com."}

In the 1940s, the African Broadcasting Service in Nairobi aired a steady stream of soukous, South African kwela, Zairean finger-style guitar and various kinds of Cuban dance music. There were also popular folk songs of Kenya's Luo and Kikuyu peoples.\nThe Luo of Kenya have long played an eight-string lyre called nyatiti, and guitarists from the area sought to imitate the instrument's syncopated melodies. In benga, the electric bass guitar is played in a style reminiscent of the nyatiti. As late as the turn of the twentieth century, this bass in nyatiti supported the rhythm essential in transmitting knowledge about the society through music. Opondo Owenga of Gem Yala, the grandfather of Odhiambo Siangla, was known in employing music as a means of teaching history of the Luo.\nIn 1967, the first major benga band, Shirati Jazz, was formed by Daniel Owino Misiani.

What's more, the fickle nature of the contemporary fashion consumer \u2013 who can take her pick from a highly competitive British high street \u2013 means that sales figures for womenswear respond smartly to change, and are swift to show whether the store is getting it right.\nThe most recent figures, released last month, show that after 10 consecutive quarters of declining sales, the first three months of 2014 showed a modest 0.6% rise in clothing sales. This result was a small bright spot in another gloomy set of figures for M&S.\nThis is the context in which Earl and her right-hand woman, womenswear director Frances Russell, now presents their third fashion season, which will go on sale in the autumn, to the fashion press.

The current temperature of the M&S relationship with catwalk trends is friendly, but not overly close.\nThe \"moods\" for the season are in synergy with the catwalk, yet given deliberately non-fashionista names: so the 1960s retro trend, which includes a short, belted pale-blue coat (\u00a399) very similar to a Gucci version and a cracked patent jacket with square sheepskin collar (\u00a389) which nods deeply to the Louis Vuitton catwalk, is dubbed \"Downtown.\"\nA rail of bold, colour-blocked tailoring which calls to mind new-season Dior is called simply \"Modernist\".

But do they also react in the opposite way by consuming more when they know that something will be recycled? That seems to be the indication from a study published recently in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.\nThe research was conducted by Jesse Catlin, an assistant professor at Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Yitong Wang, an assistant professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. They conducted two experiments to find out how much paper people used if they had the option to recycle their waste. The studies were partially funded by the project was funded in part by the Newkirk Center for Science and Society, which focuses on issues such as health and the environment as they related to community and quality of life.\nIn the first experiment, two groups of graduate students \u2014 who did not know the nature of the study \u2014 were given the task of evaluating a pair of scissors by cutting up as much paper as they could, then disposing of the paper. One group had a waste basket for that part of the task, while the second group had both a wastebasket and a recycling bucket. The group that had an option to throw their waste out in a recycling bucket chopped up nearly three times as much paper.\nIn the second experiment the researchers staked out a men's room for 30 days and monitored how many paper towels were used. For the first 15 days of the experiment the restroom only has a waste basket. For the second 15 days, they added a recycling bin. They amount of paper used per person during the second 15 days was 14 percent more.\nThe researchers calculated that the restroom would use 12,500 more paper towels per year in the second scenario.\nThe researchers also asked their undergrads who conducted the scissor experiment to fill out a questionnaire about their \"green\" behaviors. They linked the answers with previous studies that showed how people who try to behave in an eco-friendly manner often trade off and rationalize their behavior, such as saying it is okay to do a non-green thing because something else they do balances it out. In this case, they concluded that the people in the experiment used the recycling option as a way to allow themselves to use more waste because it was going to be recycled.\nAs the authors write, \"we propose that the ability to recycle may lead to increased resource usage compared to when a recycling option is not available.\" They say their paper has potential implications for further research and for policy-making, such as whether or not recycling should be available in certain situations."}

Microsoft's team compared the performance of IE 8 (currently available as Release Candidate 1), Google Chrome 1.0 and Mozilla Firefox 3.05.\nMissing from the roster of browsers tested were Safari and Opera (both of which claim to be the \"fastest\"), among others.\nMicrosoft used 25 popular Web sites, based on a comScore rankings, for its testing. IE 8 was the fastest browser at 12 sites, followed by Chrome (nine sites) and Firefox (four sites), according to the paper, \"Measuring Browser Performance: Understanding Issues in Benchmarking and Performance Analysis\" (downloadable here).\nThe study results aren't new; Microsoft executives have been citing them of late, including Mike Nash, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Windows product management, in an interview conducted last week. What's new is that Microsoft describes its benchmarking methodology in simple terms for IT pros who want to replicate the tests.\nMicrosoft's IE lab set up media player software to record the page loads and times. The team did not rely on the browser itself to report page load completion. Instead, the team used recorded visual cues. A video produced by Microsoft dramatizes this testing, which used media player software that's capable of \"approximately 1/30th of a second\" recording accuracy.\nThe use of visual cues seems a bit odd. In addition, Microsoft in some cases relied on additional information to determine the actual page load completion times. \"For sites on which specific visual cues aren't sufficient, we use a combination of visual cues and the ability to interact with content on a page to determine if a page is 'done,'\" the paper explains.\nWeb sites that used AJAX technology to report page load completion introduced complexity, according to the paper. In those cases, Microsoft relied on the visual cues.\nIT pros might have difficulty trying to replicate Microsoft's benchmark tests, especially when relying on visual cues to determine page load times. Moreover, the testing team used similar test hardware, loaded the sites beforehand to cache content and took other measures requiring lots of work to replicate.\nMicrosoft also tested the browsers with at most three add-ons, including Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight and Windows Media Player. While that's a typical use scenario, performance test results using those add-ons are not reported in the white paper.\nThose obsessed with browser speed differences of milliseconds doubtless may criticize the sample number of Web sites used in the study.

But glancing through the postings for this and other Internet service providers indicates that the transition from the old- to new-style broadband world has not been easy.\nIn fact, as many who have joined in the big-pipe feeding frenzy in the last month or two can attest, the service has been anything but \"always-on\".\nFor no apparent reason, ADSL connections have gone down, often several times a day, and even for days at a time. As a result, help lines are constantly engaged, and even e-mail support seems to be hopelessly overstretched.\nAfter a fairly fraught period that saw many of us scrambling to rejoin good old-fashioned dial-up services to provide the missing connectivity - and not a few users threatening all kinds of dire legal action in the face of their absent ADSL - it looks like the culprits have been found.\nexplains the problem was at many of the ADSL-enabled local exchanges, and requires some software upgrades.\nthat lets users find out whether their exchange is one that is affected by the problem.\nAlthough it is good that the issues are on the way to being resolved, this episode does emphasise the fragility of the ADSL connection in the UK. If the arrival of a few thousand new users causes large chunks of the entire end-user infrastructure to fail, this does not bode well for the future.\nThis is not simply an issue of loss of consumer confidence in ADSL, serious though that is. As my previous article on the subject suggested, one of the knock-on benefits of broadband uptake is likely to be that its always-on nature will encourage users to turn routinely to it for everyday needs. A corollary is that as soon as ADSL becomes in the least unreliable people will hesitate to turn to it - much less depend on it - for key aspects of their lives such as online banking or even supermarket shopping. For there is a serious problem with ADSL that has so far received relatively little attention.\nThe ADSL connection is not a pipe that can be plugged in anywhere, it is linked semi-permanently to one company, the ISP at the other end. If the service is down, for whatever reason, it is not possible simply to log in to another service provider.\nIn this respect, ADSL is worse than dial-up Internet connectivity. For dial-up, as many people have worked out, it is advisable to have at least a couple of low-cost back-up accounts in addition to your main one. Then, if the connection is unavailable, you simply dial into a back-up provider, perhaps paying by the minute for the emergency service.\nWith ADSL this is not possible. As a result, opting for always-on implies that downtime for your particular service can only be filled by swapping back to a dial-up modem."}

Whether it was 1\u2033 or 10\u2033 I have no clue and I still don\u2019t, but the opportunity was going to be there I thought.\nWell lo\u2019 and behold what do we have hinted at by our model guidance early this AM\u2026how about snow and maybe a good shot of it (per the models). The only reason I\u2019m delving into this is that there is nothing else I can think of right now to write about.\nSo let\u2019s get into it. There is one system slated for next Monday that will probably pass to the SE of here (from a moisture standpoint)\u2026although it does bear watching.\nThen there is the next one after that\u2026it\u2019s our fantasy snowstorm of the day if you will. To be honest, even the fantasy snowstorms (especially on the GFS model-the fantasy snowstorm creator) have been few and far between it seems this season but I digress.\nSo let\u2019s get farther into this storm\u2026it\u2019s actually exists right now\u2026all the way in Japan. I\u2019ve traced the path of the energy that is our next fantasy snowstorm all the way to Japan some 8740 miles away! Want me to go one step farther\u2026here you go!\nThat\u2019s Japan and I believe that\u2019s the storm to the NE of Japan. OK so what\u2019s about 8000 miles between friends. We surely know how \u201cperfect\u201d the models will handle a storm from that distance\u2026not. but anyway it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve got to work with.\nSo this energy will be traveling across the Pacific Ocean and undergoing various changes as it does so. It\u2019ll strengthen\u2026weaken\u2026maintain itself and eventually work into the Gulf Of Alaska by later in the weekend. From there it will drop into the SW part of the country early next week and this is what it ends up doing around here NEXT Thursday (the 21st).\nSo is it just a fantasy or is it real? The storm exists as I showed you so that is a step in the right direction. It doesn\u2019t appear as if we\u2019ll be overly warm on the Wednesday before the storm comes in so that too is a plus and helps with having some cool air around, instead of worrying how we\u2019re going to be in the 60s one day and get cold enough for sticking snow the next. So there is potential on that standpoint. Now can the storm do what the models are forecasting\u2026some 6-12\u2033 across a good part of the region.

In the city of Zadar, where his family lived as war refugees, a banner stating 'Luka, you will remember this one day' was displayed.\nPerhaps this Russian run has been a release from the stress of his real-life problems.\nThe simple fact is that England will have to put the shackles on the 32-year-old if they are to emerge from Wednesday's showdown.\nIt could be argued that he is currently playing the best football of his career, even if his role as Croatia's main man affords him less freedom than he can enjoy in a Real Madrid side where he is surrounded by stars and often drifts wide to make an impact.\nOn paper there will be a Champions League final rematch in the centre of the park, with Modric to the fore for Croatia and Liverpool's Jordan Henderson holding the fort as the main engine room operator in Gareth Southgate's 3-5-2.\nIt's not necessarily that straightforward, however, as Modric has taken up a range of positions during this tournament.\nFor example, in Croatia's hard-fought success over Russia on Saturday - a second successive shoot-out win - Modric spent only 15pc of his time in the attacking third.\nIn spells, Croatia's attacking passing was slow and laboured and they lacked Modric's game-changing ability to lift the tempo and pick out killer passes.\nAlthough it was a high-scoring affair, the hosts effectively concentrated on making themselves difficult to beat.\nTowards the tail end of a qualifying campaign in which they required a final-day win in Ukraine to make the play-offs, new coach Zlatko Dalic encouraged Modric to play in a more advanced role and it paid off spectacularly.\nThere were patches during the Russia encounter where he was neutralised from his brief, although his quality still stood out every time he got on the ball.\nThe clash with England has the potential to suit his strengths if Southgate sticks with the strategy that has brought his side to this point.\nBefore the round of 16 clash with Colombia, there was a fear they would be exposed if Henderson was left isolated in the centre of the park against the South American playmakers - especially if Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard were pressed on.\nHowever, the absence of James Rodriguez changed Jose Pekerman's approach and their negative play ultimately got what it deserved.

He's already giving headaches to President Erdogan.\nThe government has good reason to feel skittish. After years in which the Kurds have played a relatively marginal role in Turkish electoral politics, Demirtas and his party are suddenly poised to offer a powerful challenge to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling party in the parliamentary election set for this Sunday (June 7). While the Kurds may find it hard to crack the absolute parliamentary majority of Erodgan\u2019s Justice and Development Party (AKP), a strong showing for the HDP could allow them to assume a crucial spoiler role in post-election maneuverings \u2014 namely by thwarting Erdogan\u2019s plan to push Turkey farther down the road to autocracy.\nErdogan wants to transform Turkey\u2019s political system into a strong presidential republic with himself at the helm. To do that will mean amending the constitution, which in turn requires a three-fifths majority in parliament (330 seats out of a total of 550). Over the past two decades, the rise of Erdogan and his immensely popular AKP have made life difficult for Turkey\u2019s fractious opposition, which consists of three main parties that have rarely managed to find common cause. Marshaling effective resistance to Erdogan\u2019s agenda is additionally complicated by Turkey\u2019s election law, which sets a high bar (10 percent of the vote) for political parties wishing to enter parliament.\nIn the past, the Kurdish party had little chance of reaching the threshold; some Kurds ran as individuals, on independent tickets, but their influence in parliament was correspondingly diluted. Most observers of Turkey\u2019s political scene were correspondingly skeptical when the HDP announced that it would contest the election as a party this time around. Yet they apparently didn\u2019t reckon with Demirtas, whose skillful leadership has enabled him to transcend his party\u2019s traditional limitations and to shake up the political establishment like few other opposition leaders in recent memory.\nDemirtas has managed to capture the imagination of many liberal Turks who are desperately in search for a strong opposition leader. He\u2019s young, focused, and has an astute sense of humor, deftly poking fun at Erdogan\u2019s penchant for turning even the most remotely political event into a campaign rally.\nAll this makes for a stark contrast with the old HDP and its predecessors, which had exclusively Kurdish platforms that never allowed them to emerge from the \u201cethnic box.\u201d Demirtas has changed all that by working to widen the party\u2019s political base. Under his leadership the HDP has become more inclusive, fielding many Turkish candidates and making significant inroads into the mainstream Turkish electorate. Having run a highly effective (though ultimately unsuccessful) campaign against Erdogan in last year\u2019s presidential election, Demirtas has thus managed to capitalize on the disarray of the other traditional opposition parties. He has even succeeded in improving the HDP\u2019s showing in western Turkey, where there are relatively few ethnic Kurds.\nIn the coming election Demirtas will be banking in particular on the support of so-called \u201cstrategic voters.\u201d These are Turks who aren\u2019t natural supporters of his party but whose genuine dislike for the AKP and its authoritarian designs moves them to vote for the HDP.\nUnnerved by the party\u2019s rise, the HDP\u2019s opponents are pulling out all the stops.

After all, the histories of the fights for racial justice in the United States and in South Africa have been closely intertwined for more than a century.\nHere\u2019s a look at the evolution of the overlap between the anti-apartheid movement and the U.S. civil rights movement, and what to know about the context that surrounds Obama\u2019s historic speech.\nThe histories of both South Africa and the United States are deeply connected to stories of one race trying to dominate another. In the former, a minority of white colonial rulers exerted control over the black population in the region into the 20th century, with the apartheid regime persisting after independence; in the latter, slavery was followed by the passage of state and local \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws that enforced racial segregation in many places.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that comparisons and exchanges between the two cultures are long-established.\nThat exchange continued for decades, and cultural and political interchange often overlapped; for example, the famous South African singer Miriam Makeba married Stokely Carmichael, founder of the Black Panther movement, and Langston Hughes introduced many Americans to the facts of apartheid by publishing the work of black South Africans who couldn\u2019t get published at home.\nAs black citizens of both nations struggled with discriminatory systems, progressive ideas spread between the two countries, even if the political activists who conceived them could not always be there to share them in person. In the 1920s, the South African government started becoming increasingly cautious about allowing African Americans into the country, launching a crackdown that would last until the end of apartheid in the early 1990s. The University of Fort Hare was established in 1916 to educate black South Africans so that they wouldn\u2019t go to America to be educated, censors banned albums by Makeba and Harry Belafonte, and when Martin Luther King Jr. was invited to speak in South Africa by student groups in 1966 the government denied him a visa.\nSome African-American civil rights leaders, like Malcolm X, made a point of traveling elsewhere in Africa and avoiding South Africa. Still, during this period leading into the 1960s, even though much work remained to be done in the United States, many South African activists found inspiration in what their counterparts in the U.S. were accomplishing.\nIn the 1960s, however, as the modern U.S. civil rights era reached its most famous moments, the dynamic between the two nations shifted.\nEven as their tactics sometimes diverged, American civil rights activists continued to link their struggle to the struggle of black South Africans, to show that what was going on in the American South was just one of many"}

Smiling, the two slip cozily into a booth.\nIt's just days since the New York Times dusted the place with accolades, calling it a top Italian restaurant and the pastas \"just short of incredible.\" But the humble Umberto, now 55, doesn't mention the recent glitter; instead, he recounts the story of his romance with a nice Jewish girl from Los Angeles.\nIt was during the mid-'80s, when Umberto, a recent immigrant from Italy, was introduced to Leslie Levine, now 53, as she dined with friends at Chianti, where he worked. Leslie's father ran a well-known steak house with a formidable wine list. Soon, Umberto, dressed in what Leslie remembers as a stunning Armani suit, was seated in her family's restaurant, where she worked.\nDespite interest on both sides, it took months for Umberto to make a move. \"I thought I wasn't good enough for her,\" he jokes. \"I was just an Italian desperado.\" One day, on the way to catering Sally Fields' then-husband's 40th birthday party, he called. \"Now or never,\" he thought.\nTheir first date, a conversation-packed four-hour dinner, led to more. And soon he met Shayna, Leslie's 2-year-old daughter from her previous marriage. \"I really fell in love with both of them,\" he says.\nA trip to Italy earned the enthusiastic approval of Umberto's mother. \"This is the last one I will meet,\" she announced, referring to a previous marriage of Umberto's. \"So says your Italian mother.\"\nIn 1987, a proposed relocation to San Francisco, where Umberto was slated to work at Il Fornaio, prompted a proposal of his own. The couple married at Leslie's family home. L.A.'s most celebrated chefs prepared dinner.\nNow settled in Oakland, with their daughter nearby, Leslie, a co-owner of Perbacco, and also an executive at PMI Mortgage Insurance, makes time to head the board of Meals on Wheels. She spends weekends pitching in at the restaurant. The couple admits that long restaurant hours can be wearing on a marriage, but they've always carved out time together.\nOne of those times is at their annual Passover dinner. Umberto, though Catholic, has embraced some of Leslie's Jewish traditions. The couple hosts a private seder dinner for friends using a creative haggada of poetry and readings assembled by Umberto, and he serves his own homemade matzo balls.\n\"Light as air,\" pronounces Leslie.

Effective Dec. 26, LARE's index will change from a Solactive benchmark that tracks mostly Mexico and Brazil REITs to a Prime Indexes benchmark tracking cannabis cultivators, producers and distributors, as well as cannabinoid drug makers, fertilizer producers and tobacco companies.\nThe Alternative Agroscience ETF would be the first marijuana ETF to come to market in the United States.

Monaco is managing partner of Level ETF Ventures, which owns and operates Prime Indexes, the index provider of the new Alternative Agroscience ETF. \"It demonstrates the robust nature of the industry, and the need for both issuers and index providers to continue to innovate.\"\nTypically, issuers attempt to maintain some consistency between an old and new index.

It means having to call up restaurants in advance to see if it\u2019s possible to eat there, and then feeling like a nuisance every time you have to grill a stumped waiter about how certain foods are prepared. It means developing a habit of meticulously reading through every single ingredient list, and becoming an expert at studying any allergen guide handed to you. And it means checking, double-checking, and then living with the fear that you haven\u2019t checked enough and that any oversight can, in severe cases, cost you your life.\nWhy are food allergies in children on the rise \u2013 and is there anything parents can do to protect them?\nIt is a move seemingly motivated by fear, and one that is becoming more common among high-street food chains, ever since the tragic death of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who suffered an anaphylactic reaction in 2016 after eating a Pret sandwich containing sesame that was baked into the dough, and was not identified on the food label. But it is a horribly regressive move. Rather than tackle the problems, it shifts the emphasis on to those with food allergies, making us feel unwelcome and alienated, but also seemingly uncooperative and lazy.\nWhile businesses seem to be profiting from the rising \u201cfree-from\u201d food trends like veganism \u2013 Leon just rolled out its plant-based burger \u2013 catering to those with serious health concerns like food allergies does not seem like a priority. On their website, Leon emphasises its mission to \u201calways make it easy for everyone to eat well and live well\u201d, yet with their latest statement, it seems to be doing the exact opposite.\nLeon is not the only high-street chain that is insensitive and inconsistent in their warnings. Itsu, co-owned by the co-founder of Pret, faced scrutiny earlier this month after putting up blanket warning signs that food contained allergens only confused customers even more, and Italian-American joint Frankie and Benny\u2019s even asked customers with allergies to sign a form that states the company could never guarantee that a dish was completely free of any allergen - except for gluten, according to a BBC investigation. Signing a licence to be killed doesn\u2019t necessarily ease the minds of those who are already so vigilant: more than half of young people with a food allergy avoid eating out as a result of their conditions and only 14% say they feel confident enough to ask about allergen information, according to a survey by the Food Standards Agency last September.\nInstead of trying to cover themselves, companies should see this as an opportunity to build their reputation, increase their customer base and even, as a moral duty to help those suffering from food allergies. With more than two million people affected in the UK, a figure that is increasing, they\u2019ll have to do it sooner or later. So why not now?\nAt least the UK government is now looking to toughen the rules on food-labelling, but let\u2019s hope that more than just this bare minimum is done. We need consistent information of what exactly is in our food, how it is prepared, and vitally, to create an environment where it at feels normal to ask. As expert decision-makers when it comes to food, allergy-sufferers are more than capable of deciding what meets our safety requirements as long as we are provided with all the information we need, and are not made to feel difficult for daring to ask.

Yeldon, Eddie Lacy, Trent Richardson and Mark Ingram don\u2019t have Henry\u2019s second-gear speed. Can\u2019t see Henry packing on the pounds like Richardson and Lacy have done.\nHenry\u2019s a freak of nature in terms of his size, frame, strength and speed, had the greatest single-season of any Alabama back, but many draft analysts project him to go in the second or third round. He\u2019s not attending Thursday\u2019s first round in Chicago, which gives indication he won\u2019t be chosen on Day 1.\nThe Heisman Trophy winner rushed for 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns, won a national championship and played in the toughest conference in college football, but has more question marks on him than the Riddler. Google the costume to figure out the metaphor if it makes no sense to you.\nSo Henry should exceed those expectations because they aren\u2019t high considering his production last season. ESPN NFL analyst Merril Hoge said Henry lacks \u201cspontaneous agility,\u201d meaning he struggles making moves in traffic. His upright running style is in question.\nHenry\u2019s not considered a great pass catcher. In short, he\u2019s someone who must play behind a great offensive line to open gaping holes because he can\u2019t make the necessary cuts at the line of scrimmage or doesn\u2019t run behind his pads well enough to endure the physical pounding he\u2019ll take in the NFL.\nSo Henry might as well just settle for a decent NFL career that may last just four or five years, but he showed last season settling is not in his DNA. His relentlessness, pride and durability is being overlooked and those things enhance his talent and ability.\nEveryone inside Jordan-Hare Stadium knew Jake Coker was going to take the snap and give Henry the ball over and over again, but Auburn couldn\u2019t stop Henry from rushing for 271 yards and a game-clinching touchdown on a ridiculous 46 carries. He gained more yards than Auburn did as a team \u2013 260.\nThe overall lack of success of recent Tide backs is likely having an impact on how NFL teams view Henry. Those type of games show more than just his ability to produce. They show he can rise to the moment and push through fatigue to deliver in the biggest games. That\u2019s what made Henry special last season and could be the difference in him having a decent, good, great or Hall of Fame NFL career.\nRichardson hasn\u2019t lived up to being the third overall pick in 2012. He\u2019s only rushed for 2,032 yards and 17 touchdowns in three NFL seasons and didn\u2019t even play in the league last season. The Baltimore Ravens are giving him another chance, which is no surprise since former Crimson Tide star tight end Ozzie Newsome is running things there as the team\u2019s general manager.\nRichardson has trimmed down to 218 pounds according to a report on the team's website. He had ballooned up to 240, lost all the shake in this running style and looked done the last time we saw him in a NFL uniform in a preseason game last year with the Oakland Raiders.\nJust don\u2019t see Henry losing the battle of the bulge.

This woman comes first.\n2. Our relationship will not be defined by expectation and tradition.\n3. The past won\u2019t guide our future.\nWe now know Harry didn\u2019t get his knot-tying wish. The couple\u2019s wedding last spring, set inside the historic grandeur of St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle, was a global spectacle. Between the horse-drawn carriage and enough fascinators to cover the moon, this wedding was about as \u201csmall and intimate\u201d as Wembley Stadium.\nBut the subtext of those now forgotten eloping rumours \u2014 that Harry and Meghan are willing to buck Buckingham Palace norms and go it alone \u2014 endures.\nIf anything, that subtext is now a flashing neon billboard.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will soon leave Kensington Palace for Frogmore Cottage. Parenthood is on the horizon. And depending on what you believe, there is now a feud between Markle and sister-in-law Kate Middleton. Or there is bad blood between Harry and his brother William. Or both couples really can\u2019t stand each other.\nWhatever the truth, in the helter-skelter of blurry royal coverage, a picture has emerged of Harry and Meghan as reluctant stars inside an arcane ecosystem they don\u2019t particularly fancy. They are together alone, itching to twist out of their royal shackles. They want to pursue their own hopes and dreams, many of which do not overlap with their official duties.\nThey are doves locked inside a gilded cage.\nIn the Sunday Times this weekend, a story \u2014 \u201cQueen halts breakaway bid by Prince Harry and Meghan\u201d \u2014 claimed the young couple even attempted to seek \u201ctotal royal freedom\u201d to create an \u201cautonomous new court.\u201d They were rebuffed.\nTo which I\u2019d argue: yes they can.\nThe solution? It\u2019s time for Harry and Meghan to embrace a radical idea and become part-time royals. It\u2019s time to split the calendar between London and anywhere else.\nIt\u2019s time for them to be liberated from the burden of expectation.\nFor six months each year, Harry and Meghan fulfil their royal obligations. Then for the other six months, they do whatever they want, wherever they want. Charitable outreach? Feminist advocacy? A dog-grooming business? It doesn\u2019t matter.\nMaybe they spend six months in Los Angeles, in proximity to their celebrity pals, including George Clooney, who has become Meghan\u2019s unofficial spokesperson in recent weeks.

It\u2019s a mirage for the public. The peace in prisons is kept by the inmates, who are contained by the officers. There is a big difference.\nWhen I first went to jail, the IRA prisoners had respect. They were at the top of the tree. There was an occasion when I was put on the \u201cblock\u201d (the segregation unit). And it was the IRA who got me out. They said to the authorities: \u201cHe\u2019s had enough in there, let him out.\u201d I saw a prison officer get punched in the face once by an inmate because he made a remark about Irish people. Nothing happened in response.\nPrisons became much more divided after the Good Friday agreement, when the Irish prisoners left, and then after the Tory home secretary Michael Howard introduced the incentives and earned privileges scheme (IEPS).\nUnder the scheme, some prisoners got TVs and others didn\u2019t. Things like that have a profound effect inside. It caused real tension between prisoners, and between prisoners and the officers. The environment changed. We weren\u2019t all in it together.\nIf you go into prison thinking the prison officers will keep you alive, you won\u2019t survive. You won\u2019t last 24 hours. That\u2019s not the way prison works.\nWhen he was justice minister, Chris Grayling made things even worse. He wanted to take away self-esteem from prisoners and degrade them \u2013 to stop us wearing the clothes we wanted, or wearing the watches we wanted.\nAnd when there are cuts, and there aren\u2019t enough prison officers, the only way to contain people is to lock them up all day. That can only lead to trouble. If you lock people up for too long, I can assure you it will go off inside. What has happened already will be nothing to compared with how bad it will get.\nIn the prison system there are a lot of young, powerful guys, kept in cages where their frustrations build beyond belief. Prison officers cannot manage them. Many of the officers are old guys \u2013 if the inmates decide to turn on them, that\u2019s it. I can easily see it happening.\nWhen I was first inside, there were drugs everywhere. People were smoking heroin in the open in the yard, bubbling up hooch in wheelie bins, taking ecstasy. It was mad.\nI know guys who have made so much money from selling drugs inside that they\u2019ve bought houses when they got out. In the high security prisons there is less of that now, because there are far more Muslim inmates. They don\u2019t take drugs and they don\u2019t sell drugs.\nBut in the category B prisons it\u2019s the same as it ever was. You get your parcel of drugs, your mobile phone, and you crack on with your sentence. The prison staff know it\u2019s going on but they know they cannot stop it.\nHiring more prison officers won\u2019t solve the problems inside our prisons. Thursday\u2019s announcement won\u2019t stop people re-offending when they come out.\nIf it was down to me, I\u2019d get the prison service to run courses for inmates to help them prepare for life outside. At the moment, the courses aren\u2019t geared for the reality you face when you come out. You have to do courses that look backwards, concentrating on what got you into prison in the first place. But you don\u2019t need to be prodded about your past.\nThose courses are about humiliation and control. What you"}

By entrusting the camera and much of the narration to one of the residents -- the philosophical, college-educated alcoholic Robert \"Rabbit\" Beringer -- McCabe provides a rare inside look at what may have been the East Bay's last great hobo jungle. A disparate collection of social misfits -- poets, lovers, addicts, artists, and builders of junk castles -- gather to build a self-reliant alternative community on the outskirts of the mainstream economy in this strange but idyllic setting.

For everyone else, read on!\nWhen Breaking Dawn Part 1 wrapped up, Bella gave birth to a baby daughter.

Mario Chalmers tried to stop him, then Dwyane Wade, then LeBron James. None of it worked. Rondo scored eight points and dished out 10 assists in the first half alone.\nDown 61-47 at halftime, Spoelstra had one more card to play.\nHe whipped out the trap. Rivers said he was surprised to see Spoelstra use it on Rondo during Game 3, and he doubted that he\u2019d see a \u201csteady diet\u201d of it in Game 4. But the trap was working. Rondo scored just five points in the second half and his five assists looked like a number any opposing coach would be happy with.\nBut Spoelstra\u2019s brightest moves might\u2019ve been in the way he handled his superstars.\nWade, who had struggled mightily in the early going, stayed on the court the entire second half as Spoelstra skipped his regular rotation of rest. After going just 2 for 11 from the field in the first half, Wade hit 5 of 10 in the second.\nAnd when LeBron James picked up his fifth foul with 5:32 left in regulation, his coach left him in the game for another 54 seconds, pulled him for 62 seconds, and put him right back in the game.\nJames hit the game-tying three-pointer with 27.5 seconds left to play to eventually send it to overtime.\nWhat looked like an easy win for the Celtics was suddenly a nail-biter.\nSpoelstra\u2019s players may not have executed down the stretch. James missed some crucial free-throws, going just 4 for 8 from the line. Wade let a pass roll right through his legs and out of bounds during a critical possession down one with just two minutes left.\nAnd in overtime, with two seconds left and the Heat down by two, Wade missed a wide-open look from behind the arc.\nThese things were out of Spoelstra\u2019s control.

He closed his set with a Beck song--and Beck himself. The singer, bearded and breakdancing with a guitarist in tow, leaped on stage to sing over his own sample, and send the crowd over the top.\nThat slice of performance not only spoke to the festival's aspirations to become an industrial-sized sampler of both rock and electronic dance flavor, but also summed up the Coachella ideal of placing stars with mainstream clout alongside obscure experimentalists.\nThe approach has won over fans--this year's edition appeared to be on track to make its first profit, and the announced Saturday attendance of 30,000 was a single-day record for the event--and made the show one where artists come to check out other artists. \"There's one big pot out here, stirring it up,\" said Chaly 2na, the frontman of acclaimed hip-hop collective Jurassic 5, one of the numerous Los Angeles acts performing. \"You want to see what everybody's doing, too.

The fan favorite on Saturday night seemed to be the show-closing set by the Chemical Brothers, who returned to Coachella for their third visit.\nIf the British duo looked out on the crowd, they saw the familiar sights of nighttime Coachella: the friendly chaos of thousands of fans dancing, kicking back on blankets or, most commonly, navigating their way to the next stage to catch as many glimpses of different performances as possible.\nAfter the crowd reached peak size under the amber full moon, it was impossible in most areas to walk three paces in any direction without colliding with someone.

During one particularly long hiking day in Patagonia, the conversation turned to a client\u2019s business. The client has a small but highly profitable professional service business. He\u2019s run the company for 40 years and has talked about retiring in the next five to ten years. A few years ago he brought his mid-20 year old son into the business. The son has flourished in the position \u2013 exceeding expectations.\nBack to the conversation on the trail. My client wanted to brainstorm ideas on how best to transition the company. Specifically, what kind of payout would be appropriate, valuation, timing, tax implications, etc. There is no doubt these are critical considerations that need to be analyzed and addressed, however, I suggested we think about things a little differently.\nWhenever you are thinking in terms of business succession planning, there are two tracks you should consider. The first is the mechanics of the deal. These are the things my client was focused on such as valuation and tax implications. More importantly, at least initially, is to focus on making sure the transition will be successful long term. What does this mean? This involves making sure that whoever you are transitioning the company to will be in a position to take over and effectively run the company. Seems obvious, but surprisingly I often see more time and energy on the mechanics of the transition than making sure the people who are going to run the company have the skills and confidence to actually run the company.\nThis is less of a concern if you have a larger company and you are receiving 100% of the purchase price on the date of sale. This is also rare. Most often the purchaser will pay a smaller percentage in cash at closing and then will pay an earn-out over time based on the success of the company. In that case, or in the case of my client who is transitioning to a younger family member, there may be very little cash received at the time of the sale. When this occurs, the majority of the purchase price is paid for over time from the company\u2019s profits. And this, of course, is why the long-term success of the company is so important. You can hire the best legal and tax team available to work on the mechanics of the transition, but if you don\u2019t educate and empower the new owners the company will flounder and all the expected transition proceeds will never materialize.\nThe biggest risk isn\u2019t getting the valuation just right or missing a tax loophole. The biggest risk is the future success of the company since all or most of the buyout occurs after the sale is completed. This is why it is critical to spend time, energy, money, and resources doing whatever it takes to ensure your succession team is confident, skilled, and ready to take over and grow the company.\nOn the flight home, my client and I \u2013 much to the chagrin of his wife sitting between us \u2013 worked on a five-year empowerment plan. We identified all the critical areas of the business and he gave his son a score between 1-10 based on his knowledge and confidence in each area. In several categories his son had 9s and 10s and a few had 1s and 2s. This simple process provided a snapshot of where his son was currently and where he needed help. We then created a calendar over the next three years of where my client should focus his efforts.\nIf you own a business and are considering a transition to a family member, think about all the areas that are critical for the success of your business. Now think about your team. Can they take over? If not, you know where you need to focus. Spend your time and resources here rather than"}

Across the room sat a team of prosecutors, a judge, and military personnel.\nThe 40-second delay in audio streaming\u2014to prevent transmission of classified information\u2014and the multiple security checks to enter the gallery reminded me that this wasn\u2019t like any courtroom I had been to in the continental United States. This was Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and I was here to observe a pre-trial hearing session at a military commission in the prosecution of Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi.\nAn Iraqi national, Hadi was captured in Turkey in October 2006. The CIA held him in a black site for nearly six months before he was transferred to Gitmo in April 2007.\nHadi is considered a high value detainee. He is charged with committing serious violations of the laws of war as a senior member of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere from 2001 to 2006. The attacks he allegedly participated in killed and injured U.S. and coalition service members and civilians, in addition to destroying property.\nIf convicted, Hadi faces life in prison.\nUnlike proceedings in federal courts, where the public can show up on the day of the hearing to observe, proceedings in the military commissions are not easily accessible. This was the third time that I made travel arrangements to visit Guantanamo. The first time, I received notice that the hearings had been cancelled the day before my trip. The second time, the office of military commissions failed to process my paperwork in time.\nAfter all that buildup, the five-day trip to Gitmo was disappointing. The open hearings lasted only four hours\u2014the same amount of time that we had waited at Andrews Air Force Base for our plane to depart to Guantanamo.\nMilitary Judge Peter Rubin, a Marine Colonel, heard oral arguments on four out of six motions. Most of the issues were related to the in-court deposition of Ahmed Mohammad Ahmed Haza Al Darbi, which is scheduled to begin in August.\nThe prosecution filed a motion to require Hadi to be present for the portion of Al Darbi\u2019s deposition during which he will identify the defendant. The prosecution argued that a face-to-face identification of the defendant is necessary given the debate over his identity.\nThe debate over Hadi\u2019s identity stems from questions about his given name. Since May 2016, Hadi\u2019s defense team has claimed that his given name is actually Nashwan al Tamir. The defense noted that \u201cAbd al Hadi al-Iraqi\u201d is a title used throughout the Middle East.\nIn last month\u2019s hearing, the defense opposed the prosecution\u2019s request to require Hadi\u2019s presence at Al Darbi\u2019s deposition for a face-to-face identification. The defense cited regulations that allow the defendant to waive his right to be present in a deposition.\nJudge Rubin asked the parties what his authority was to require the accused to be present at a session if it is not a hearing. This sparked argument over whether the applicable rules considered a deposition to be part of the trial process. The prosecution ultimately claimed that the accused does not have the right to be absent, stating that such tactics would frustrate the public interest in justice.\nThis back-and-forth over the applicable rules went on for the four hours that I sat in the courtroom gallery.\nThe time and effort spent reconciling different interpretations of the military commission\u2019s"}

The Washington AG's office publishes a Student Loan Survival Guide.\nIn mid-2017, Ferguson demanded that U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos end delays in canceling federal student loan forgiveness for thousands of Washingtonians victimized by predatory for-profit colleges.\nIn making Maveron a minority shareholder in Capella, Schultz said at the time: \"Capella wants to transform education for working adults by making the online experience as compelling and rewarding as possible.\"\nMaveron severed its connection when the online university went public in 2006.\nAs Politico reported Wednesday, the Inspector General's office did an audit of Capella in 2008 and found the university had overcharged the federal student aid program by $588,000 between 2002 and 2005. It recommended that the Federal Student Aid Office ask for the money back.\nCapella responded that it had failed to return some money loaned to students who dropped out early, but pegged the amount at $278,000.\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP), in a 2012 report, voiced \"serious concern\" at the dropout rate of Capella students, and noted \"an unusually high portion of revenue on marketing and a relatively small amount on instruction for its exclusively online program.\"\nRELATED: Betsy DeVos vs. Patty Murray: Does nominee aim to privatize public education?\nThe Senate committee found that in 2009, Capella spent $1,650 per student on instruction, compared to $4,538 per student on marketing and $2,912 on profit.\n\"Dig deep into the prospect's needs, goals, motivations, dreams, aspirations, etc. (uncovering the 'why'). Use this information to position Capella as a solution.\"\nThe report added: \"Student complaints indicate dissatisfaction with the level of instruction at Capella.\"\nSen.

Today's story was written by Ryan, Walker, and Wallack.\nBoston\u2019s power brokers met in secret for months, drafting an ambitious bid to host the 2024 Olympics. They imagined the city on the world stage, showcasing a modernized transit system, a grand boulevard, and gleaming new neighborhoods that would define Boston for the next millennium.\nLegal documents made it clear who was in charge: five prominent executives from the region\u2019s dominant spheres of influence, representing business, higher education, sports, and construction. All five were white, and their initial Olympic plan envisioned new buildings and venues sprinkled across Greater Boston. But other than Franklin Park, the Games would not include another venue in the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods.\nIt was a stark example of how in Boston \u2014 from politics to boardrooms, law firms to the State House, and labor halls to hospitals \u2014 blacks still find themselves shut out of the insular world of Massachusetts\u2019 powerbrokers.\nThe Globe\u2019s Spotlight Team examined whether Boston still deserves its longstanding reputation as an inhospitable place for blacks. It found that in the corridors of power, blacks have failed to gain commensurate economic and political clout in a city where they make up nearly one-quarter of the population.\nIn many other major American cities, from Philadelphia to Atlanta and Los Angeles, the black community has made good on the promise of the civil rights movement by amassing economic and political power \u2014 the ability to wield influence and exert control.\nSeattle and Minneapolis have elected black mayors. Denver has had two. All three cities have smaller black populations than Boston, which has never elected a black mayor.\nDespite Boston\u2019s reputation as a liberal bastion, the region\u2019s power base remains largely white men. Blacks\u2019 political achievements are more occasional than institutional. There are no black faces in Massachusetts\u2019 congressional delegation, nor among statewide officeholders, and the only black to win election to statewide office since 1972 is former governor Deval Patrick. Such infrequent electoral victories are different from an ongoing voice in all the affairs of a city.\nMassachusetts has an 11-member congressional delegation.\nAll 11 are all white.\nMassachusetts has six statewide constitutional officers such as governor and attorney general.\nMassachusetts has 200 representatives and senators in the state Legislature.\nEight are Hispanic, six are black, five are Asian, and one seat is currently vacant.\nAll the others are white.\nAmong Massachusetts\u2019 publicly traded companies, just 1 percent of board members are black. Only two of the roughly 200 companies have black chief executives. Most major law firms have few, if any, black partners. Greater Boston has only one black leader of a major union. And the powerful group of chief executives known as the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership has no black members.\nThat concentration of power makes it especially significant that Boston has never had a black mayor, given that City Hall has historically been a springboard for civic and philanthropic leaders across the city.\nAmong the most populous 25 American cities, Boston is one of nine that has never elected a black mayor. In fact, it joins Indianapolis as the only metropolises to exclusively elect white men. Boston has had 48 in a row.\nBoston mayors are so entrenched that the"}

Insurgent leaders in some countries transform local structures of government, while others simply extract resources for their own benefit. In some contexts, groups kill their victims selectively, while in other environments violence appears indiscriminate, even random. This book presents a theory that accounts for the different strategies pursued by rebel groups in civil war, explaining why patterns of insurgent violence vary so much across conflicts. It does so by examining the membership, structure, and behavior of four insurgent movements in Uganda, Mozambique, and Peru. Drawing on interviews with nearly 200 combatants and civilians who experienced violence firsthand, it shows that rebels' strategies depend in important ways on how difficult it is to launch a rebellion. The book thus demonstrates how characteristics of the environment in which rebellions emerge constrain rebel organization and shape the patterns of violence that civilians experience."}

They lasted about 2.2 days per month. Those people scored an average of 52 out of 100 on a stress scale.\nMigraine sufferers were less common: Only 14 percent of participants reported a migraine. These headaches are more pulsating and can be moderate or severe in pain intensity. However, their pain persisted for a total of about 4.5 days on average. They recorded a 62 on the stress scale.\nJust 11 percent had both a migraine and tension-type headache, which lasted about 3.6 days on average. Those people had a 59-point stress score.\nThere was a clear correlation between more stress and more headaches per month.

All the time.\nIt's part of the unique way that Xiaomi operates, closely analyzing the user feedback it gets on its smartphones and following the suggestions it likes for the next batch of 100,000 phones. It releases them every Tuesday at noon Beijing time.\n\"Every batch is incrementally better,\" said Hugo Barra, the ex-Google product executive who jumped over to Xiaomi in August in what looked like a role to help the company expand internationally.\nBarra was speaking on stage at the GMIC mobile conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, alongside Xiaomi's billionaire founder Lei Jun. Just across the street at the Moscone Center North, Apple was releasing a new range of iPads, last updated in November 2012.\nBarra, who had his own experience at Google to compare to, said Xiaomi's obsessive and rapidly-executed focus on user feedback was \"not something you see often in this landscape.\" He revealed that product managers at the company can spend half their time perusing the company's active user forums.\n\"[A] suggestion gets picked up by a product manager within hours. Within a few [more] hours it can be at an engineer's desk.\" If they think it's a good idea, the suggestion can go in the next weekly build. \"A number of unique features we've built are user suggestions. Things that came out of someone's head rather than product mangers.\" Xiaomi calls its end users \"me fans.\"\nWhile this crowd-sourced approach to developing a product is the complete antithesis to Apple's secretive, top-down approach, Xiaomi gets called the Apple of China on a regular basis. \"What we are trying to accomplish is very different to what Apple is trying to achieve,\" said Jun, who spoke through a translator.\nAnother key difference was cost. \"We're trying to create greater products while selling a product that is close to the manufacturing price,\" he said.\nUndercutting the iPhone has helped Xiaomi gain more than 5% smartphone marketshare in China, overtaking Apple's 4.8%. While iPhones cost around $900 in the country, Xiaomi's cheapest phone costs around $300. Xiaomi's valuation of $10 billion has also helped boost Jun's net worth to $3.5 billion, and in September the three-year old company said it had finally become profitable. It is reportedly on track to triple handset sales this year.\nBarra, who Jun said was the first \"truly international person\" to join Xiaomi, said he'd been tracking the company for the last two years while at Google. Xiaomi had a \"quirky\" culture, which might make it harder to find talented individuals it can hire as it expands internationally, but its focus on users reminded Barra of Google's \"Don't be evil\" ethos.\nJun talked up the company's 100% compatibility with Google's Android operating system, hinting that he had no plans to launch his own software platform; its phones have a customized user interface built on top of Android.\nNeither executive would say which country Xiaomi wants to expand to first, though Jun said it had been testing the waters in Taiwan. The market would need a populace that's active on social media and have a strong e-commerce infrastructure, he added. While the U.S"}

And it seems, especially in the last year, as if your negotiating tactics have sort of cut away at that trust by compromising some key principles that we believed in, like repealing the tax cut, not fighting harder for single-payer. Even Social Security and Medicare seemed on the line when we were dealing with the debt ceiling. So I\u2019m just curious, moving forward, what prevents you from taking a harder negotiating stance, being that it seems that the Republicans are taking a really hard stance?\nObama: Now, I know that people would like to say \u2018Well, just do something to get these guys under control. You don\u2019t want to reward unreasonableness. Look, I get that. But sometimes you\u2019ve got to make choices in order to do what\u2019s best for the country at that particular moment.\nThe GOP is currently falling into a classic Obama trap. I may be wrong but the GOP may be confirming my long-ago expectation that they'd swing to the far right after Obama's election, be given false confidence by a low turn-out mid-term, and then nominate someone essentially unelectable as a national figure. But in this economy, all predictions are unreliable. The toxic cloud of high unemployment, low growth, and a vanishing middle class will make volatility and populism the norms. Which means that we may not have the full roster of Republican candidates yet.\nRight, because cutting benefits for poor and old people, rather than raising taxes on the top 2% is definitely what's best for this country.\n\"some key principles that we believed in, like repealing the tax cut\"\nLet's make it clear. Obama never proposed repealing the Bush tax cut. He proposed repealing it only on the top 2% of earners, a small group that he thought he could demonize. Now he is talking about repealing it only on people making more than a million dollars a year, a group that amounts to only about one tenth of one percent of the population. Hows THAT for political courage!\nIt simply not possible to wring enough extra tax out of such a small group to materially reduce the deficit. If liberals are so gung ho about raising taxes, why don't they demand that Obama repeal the ENTIRE Bush tax cut? Is it because the public would soon realize that, despite all the propaganda in the press, the Bush tax cut did not benefit only the wealthy?\nVote for me and I'll prevent the far right from taking control of our country by giving in to them. But, I promise, I'll make sure they allow us to keep our 10%!\nIt's almost as if Obama lacks the skills or the experience to be an effective President. If only someone had pointed this out prior to the election.\nI'm stunned a politician from Chicago does not know how to negotiate with the opposition.\nBrian: The people who allegedly \"create most of the jobs\" have had some of the lowest taxes in the developed world for years on end. Where are the jobs?\nPan, the people working have those jobs.\nJobs? how about we tariff the snot out of all the manufactured goods coming from the Asian countries? The USA is capable of producing manufactured goods, give us something to work with, small manufacturers can not compete against Asia, we can't purchase the raw materials for what they sell the completed products for.

Ms. Gould is a writer whose first novel will come out this summer, and the apartment belongs to her friend Sadie Stein, a contributing editor for The Paris Review. Both hang out with a young, literary, food-obsessed crowd, and they had met up with two friends to eat baked mustard chicken and that creamed spinach, debating and paying tribute to a writer whose work overflows with stove-centered gatherings just like this one.\nMs. Colwin was an author, self-described \u201crefined slob\u201d and passionate, idiosyncratic home cook who died in 1992, when the members of this salon were still in grade school. During her life, she gained a reputation first and foremost as a novelist and a composer of delicately calibrated short stories. But in the years since her death, at the age of 48, her following has only grown, and her highly personal food writing, collected in the books \u201cHome Cooking\u201d and \u201cMore Home Cooking,\u201d has attracted a new, cultishly devoted generation of readers. Her musings, anecdotes and quirkily imprecise, not-altogether-reliable recipes show up with regularity on food blogs. Which only makes sense, because even though Ms. Colwin expressed wariness about technology and cranked out her essays (most of them for Gourmet magazine) on a mint-green Hermes Rocket typewriter, there is something about her voice, conveyed in conversational prose, that comes across as a harbinger of the blog boom that would follow.\nIn turn, friendships have formed around her work. Ms. Stein, 32, first picked up \u201cHome Cooking\u201d when she was 9 or 10; her parents had it around the house in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. \u201cI quietly commandeered the book for my own use,\u201d Ms. Stein recalled. Years later, a shared passion for the Colwinesque view of food and life brought her together for those dinners with Ms. Gould; Ruth Curry, who works in publishing; and Lukas Volger, a cookbook author and entrepreneur.\nAcolytes like Ms. Stein and Ms. Gould don\u2019t merely read Laurie Colwin. They revisit her passages over and over again, and develop a guardian-angel-style attachment to her. When Ms. Reichl arrived at Gourmet as editor in chief, in 1999, she discovered in her office a cache of about 400 letters from mourning fans who had written to the magazine after Ms. Colwin\u2019s death. Ms. Reichl\u2019s \u201cvery first act\u201d as editor, she said, was to have the letters messengered over to Colwin\u2019s husband, Juris Jurjevics, a founder of the Soho Press publishing company who lives these days in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\nMost professional food writers can only dream of connecting with an audience in that way. \u201cWhen I first went to Gourmet, every writer that came in said that he or she wanted to be the next Laurie Colwin,\u201d Ms. Reichl said.\nTo Ms. Colwin\u2019s partisans, her essays stand out as an antidote"}

See How It Works from the Inside.\nPropaganda is nothing new \u2014 it's as old as politics itself \u2014 but adding the connective power of the Internet to the equation reveals an entirely new level of media that ISIS is all too happy to exploit.\nSalman Rushdie: Well aside from the obvious thoughts of ISIS, which is horror and disgust, I think we have to look at the fact that they\u2019re so unusually good at using the media. That\u2019s a great deal of their unique power is the way in which they can create themselves as the bogeyman, you know, and that they do it on purpose. It\u2019s very \u2014 I mean even the chosen methods of execution, you know, are done for maximum shock horror value. You know you want to kill people; you can do it very straightforwardly. You don\u2019t have to go through this gruesome ritual that they prefer. And the purpose of the gruesome ritual is to be scary and it works very well. They [are] also, it seems to be, extremely good at the recruitment video \u2014 where they use all these techniques including music so in order to make themselves a very attractive proposition, it seems, to some kinds of young men and women. I mean the thing that mystifies me is the women, you know. I can understand that a certain kind of disenfranchised, alienated young man might think that it was heroic or glamorous to go off and fight this secret war \u2014 or not secret war; this war in which you are a secret fighter.\nI find it very difficult to understand the phenomenon of women defecting to enter the ISIS zone because women are treated so shockingly badly there, you know. And that again goes to show the enormous effectiveness of their propaganda in overcoming the obvious facts about how women are treated, which is basically as slaves. They\u2019re certainly not given any kind of real dignity, you know. And yet the propaganda is so effective that young women from all over the world seem interested to go. So I think you have to see it as, just in media terms, as an enormously effective group. Much, much more so than any radical extremist group, I mean, in history. If you look back a bit and you look at things like the Baader Meinhof Group or, you know, The Weather Underground or whatever. They were lousy at communicating. Absolutely shockingly bad. And they certainly were not either able or interested to communicate their ideas in a way that were appealing, that was appealing to anybody. Of course they didn\u2019t have these \u2014 the technology that is now available, but what is interesting is not just that ISIS is able to communicate so efficiently, but that they can actually make themselves attractive. Given all the evidence piling up every day of their extreme unattractiveness to be able to overcome that by propaganda is quite an achievement.\nThe recent attacks in Paris shine a light on the world's current biggest boogeyman: ISIS. \"Boogeyman\" is a role that delights ISIS leadership, who are always intent on inflating their profile on the international stage. In fact, the urge to aggrandize the group only plays into its hand.\nAccording to author Salman Rushdie, ISIS has proven itself to be extremely savvy at media creation and dissemination. It uses social media sites to assist with recruiting and to boost propaganda. Its violent hype videos are always shot in a way that maximizes horror, especially the grisly beheading ones from last year. The group's goal is simple: Intimidate and scare as many Westerners as possible. Is it working?\nRushdie's"}

In the United States, some consumers are seeing \"Assembled in USA\" next to the familiar \"Designed by Apple in California\" notice that accompanies every iMac. While this label had accompanied older iMacs that were ordered with custom parts (which were pieced together domestically), the \"Assembled in USA\" label is now popping up on regular, off-the-shelf models.\nThe FTC has published a fair explanation of what a product needs to be \"Made\" or \"Assembled\" in America. A car, for example, must have more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered \"Made in America.\" The \"Assembled\" designation is much more lenient. Apple could use a large number of Chinese parts, ship them to America and assemble the product domestically in order to legally obtain the \"Assembled in America\" designation.\nIronically, the iPad -- which contains American-made parts from Corning (NYSE: GLW) and (believe it or not) Samsung -- is assembled in China. The company also purchases processors from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) that are manufactured domestically, but it is unknown where they end up.\nFoxconn, Apple's chief manufacturer, has reportedly explored the possibility of manufacturing in the United States.

He remains a resident of Sheffield, a city with a rich tradition in electronic music, once home to Warp Records, as well as the Human League, Heaven 17 and Moloko among others. However, when he, Stephen Mallinder and Christopher Watson formed Cabaret Voltaire in 1973, fired up by Eno-era Roxy Music and William Burroughs's cut-up techniques, there was no such tradition at all. \"The only musical tradition then was heavy metal, rubbish cover bands and crooners like Tony Christie.\"\nBy 1989, with Cabaret Voltaire all but petered out, a new future had arrived: rave. Warp Records would be home to a new, bespoke, Meccano-like strain of home-built techno. Early releases by LFO and Tricky Disco set the minimal tone, and then Kirk, in partnership with Richard Parrott, formed Sweet Exorcist, whose definitive CCEP/CCCD was the label's first album release in 1991. Rereleased on its 20th anniversary as RetroActivity, with additional unreleased tracks dredged up from Kirk's archive (\"I say 'archive', it's more a roomful of boxes\"), it's essentially a variation on three different tracks, with elements added and subtracted, the bare workings of breakbeats adorned by samples and loops or simply exposed. Its deconstruction/reconstruction is inspired by the ultra-minimalism of the Detroit scene of the 80s in which, as Kirk gleefully puts it, there was \"almost nothing there\".\nIronic that an experimental music veteran with 20 years behind him should be leading a fresh charge into the 90s, setting up the framework for Autechre, Aphex Twin and the whole intelligent dance music (IDM) scene, but the rise of sampling, rave and techno was the realisation of a music that codgers like Kirk had only been able to dream of decades earlier, prior to the arrival of the technology.\n\"Clubs had got quite heavy in the mid-80s,\" remembers Kirk. \"It was all designer suits and coke. That was all swept away when people started shovelling Es down their necks. I felt recharged.\"\nIt wasn't just a shift in the spirit of the times, however, from the churlish, urban aspirational 80s to the neo-hippy rural collectivism of rave.

But the Velvet Teddy Bear will change all that Thursday night (March 26) when he steps on the \"Idol\" stage again, capping a three-week blitz of returning former \"Idol\" stars visiting the show that has also included performances from Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.\n\"It's like I never left,\" Studdard said Wednesday evening after a day of \"Idol\" rehearsals. The singer flew into Los Angeles early Wednesday morning following a performance the night before in a touring production of the musical \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\"\nThe singer compared returning to \"Idol\" to going back to your old high school. \"You see all your old teachers and you get a chance to see the people who really had a part in helping you get to where you are,\" he said. But, unlike when you peek into your lunchroom and it suddenly seems so small, Studdard said the glitzy new stage is way \"bigger and flashier\" than the one he remembers standing on when he won his crown.\nStuddard, 30, joked that while he and his fellow contestants had some help from stylists, \"These kids now get to wear designer clothes every week! We didn't get to wear Dolce & Gabbana, that's for sure.\"\nStuddard is returning just in time to celebrate \"50 Years of Motown\" on a show that will also feature a performance from Smokey Robinson. Studdard will perform his buttery-smooth Stargate-produced ballad \"Together\" on TV for the first time. The song is the first single from Studdard's upcoming fourth album, Love Is, his first effort since parting ways with longtime label J Records in 2007. The album, due May 19, mostly features production by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with the Grammy-nominated Studdard stepping up to co-write four of the songs himself.\n\"I miss the people [from the show],\" he said. \"But I don't think I'd want to do the 16-hour days again, though. And to come back on Motown night ... I grew up listening to Motown music, so this will be a fun show for me to do.\"\nThough he's been busy recording and touring with \"Misbehavin',\" Studdard has stayed close to his \"Idol\" roots, returning several times to perform. He also provided the farewell song for season seven with his cover of Kenny Loggins' \"Celebrate Me Home,\" which he performed last May on the first night of the finale.\nThough he hadn't yet seen the judges when MTV News spoke to him, Studdard said he was looking forward to seeing Randy, Paula and Simon and meeting new judge Kara DioGuardi.\nBusy on the road with the musical, Studdard said he's only seen one episode of \"Idol\" so far this season and was reluctant to say who he favors in the competition. \"It's so early on now, and everyone is trying to work out their nerves and get accustomed to being away from home,\" he said. \"I haven't talked to them yet, but the only thing I can say to them is to stay focused.

The Sandlers have been the company's husband-and-wife co-chairmen and CEOs since they took it over in 1963.\nIn the intervening four decades, they have outlasted California booms and busts too numerous to count, a deregulation period that exposed the weaknesses of the S&L; business the way a receding tide uncovers ancient wrecks on a harbor bottom, and more investment fashions and fads than one might see on 7th Avenue.\nFor a sense of how difficult it has been to survive in this environment, consider that of the 20 largest thrifts in 1989, only World Savings remains in business. Right now, Golden West shares are trading near their historic highs, and the company recently reported record quarterly earnings.\nThe rule behind this success is simple: Take care of the business, and the bottom line and stock price (and stock analysts) will follow.\nNot long ago Marion went on the radio show \"Marketplace\" to explain that Golden West has never ever made financial forecasts for Wall Street, because the only reason to do so is to hype a stock. When a company is wrong, as it sometimes must be, it gets unduly punished. Instead, she said, \"We don't talk about what we're going to do; we just do it.\"\nThe show aired about the time that Coca-Cola Co., McDonald's Corp., Home Depot Inc. and other big companies announced they were swearing off quarterly forecasts.\nBut they already were at a disadvantage. Because they had taken the forecasting drug in good times, they were widely presumed by Wall Street to be giving it up because the results they would have to project from here on out would be lousy.\nAs Marion might have observed, it's easier to avoid a bad habit from the start than to have to break it later.\nOne thing people have always found intriguing about Golden West's duumvirate is how complementary they are. Marion, 72, and Herb, 71, don't complete each others' sentences so much as step on each others' lines.\nIt's not uncommon for Marion to start answering a question with a learned observation on macroeconomics or sound operational principles, only to be interrupted by Herb with a telling anecdote, which places the facts and figures in a historical context.\n\"There's a funny story about that,\" he'll"}

We investigate the information gain of bistatic perspectives with respect to a monostatic perspective by calculating the correlation coefficient between the monostatic image of a target and the bistatic image of a target for increasing bistatic angles and find a significant information gain as the bistatic angle is increased. Following our information content analysis, we implement decision-level fusion of multiple aspects using majority voting and template matching. Results show improved classification for decision-level fusion. We also investigate image registration using bistatic observations to assess the feasibility of a full aspect-diverse bistatic SAR ATR system. Bistatic images are registered to a monostatic image of the same target. Results yield significant error--indicating that traditional registration methods are not sufficient for bistatic SAR systems. In addition to our empirical studies, we also develop an analytical expression that relates the probability of error for a two-class multiple-aspect template-matching classifier to the number of perspectives fused at the image level. This expression allows investigation of the effect of various parameters, such as cross-target correlation and noise variance, on classification performance. We verify our error expression empirically and demonstrate significant improvements in classification for aspect-diverse bistatic SAR ATR. Finally, we investigate bistatic perspectives with respect to bistatic angle, and the correlation between opposing targets. We find that the correlation between two targets fluctuates extensively with respect to bistatic angle for a single transmitter location. This makes it difficult to predict good\" perspectives, but simultaneously ensures a high probability that a good perspective will be selected randomly.\"\nLaubie, Ellen E., \"Aspect diversity for bistatic synthetic aperture radar\" (2017).

But privacy comes at a cost, he added.\nSeveral groups called the ruling pivotal, and one with far reaching implications.\nAlan Butler, appellate advocacy counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), one of several groups that filed an amicus brief in the case, said the rulings affirm Fourth Amendment protections in the digital age.\n\"This is a hugely important decision. The big takeaway here is that the court recognizes that digital data is very different from its physical analogues,\" Butler said.\nToday's ruling makes it clear that cellphones and other electronic devices need to be treated differently, Butler said.\nThe Supreme Court decision follows myriad contrasting rulings by various courts across the country, noted Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"Creating a bright line rule gives the public and the police clear guidance.\"\nThe Supreme Court recognizes that smartphones are essentially miniature computers with enormous amounts of data that travels wherever the user goes, he said. \"That recognition will have important implications for future legal challenges concerning the government's use of technology, whether it be cell phone tracking, Stingrays or NSA surveillance,\" Fakhoury said.\nThe Supreme Court ruling held that mobile phones are different from other objects held by an alleged crook, such as a wallet, a purse or a cigarette pack. Searching through the contents of a cell phone is different, Roberts wrote.\n\"That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A to point B, but little else justifies lumping them together,\" he wrote. \"Modern cell phones are not just another technological convenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many Americans 'the privacies of life.'\"\nSmartphones, for example, can store huge amounts of text, pictures and video. They collect, in one place, different types of information that \"reveal much more in combination than any isolated record,\" the ruling said.\n\"A decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the more than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives,\" Roberts said.\nThe court also noted that user data and records could be stored in the cloud on servers outside the user's control, another reason why search warrants are required, the court held.\nOne of the two cases reviewed by the court involved David Riley, who was stopped by police in San Diego in 2009 for a traffic violation. He was later arrested on a gang-related charge based on information gathered from his cell phone. A trial court convicted Riley, rejecting his argument that the evidence against him was gathered without a warrant, and thus illegally. A California appellate court later affirmed the trial court verdict.\nThe second case involved Brima Wurie, who was arrested by Boston police in 2007. After the arrest, police searched through the logs of Wurie's mobile phone and traced a number that was repeatedly calling the device to his home.\nPolice then obtained a search warrant and found guns and ammunition in Wurie's home.

Kelly Townsend says abortions and violent video games, not guns, are the reason why America has an epidemic of mass shootings.\nLaurie Roberts: Arizona Rep. Kelly Townsend says abortions and violent video games, not guns, are the reason why America has an epidemic of mass shootings.\n\u2026 Well, because the National Rifle Association forbids it.\nBut it turns out no study is needed to determine what to do about the wholesale epidemic of mass murderers taking aim at us \u2013 literally \u2013 in our schools and in our movie theaters and in our churches and malls and workplaces.\nArizona\u2019s Rep. Kelly Townsend can tell you why it\u2019s happening: It\u2019s because of video games and abortion.\nDuring a House debate Tuesday on whether to ban bump stocks, Townsend said it's the culture that desensitizes us to killing that needs to change \u2013 not the ready access to guns that can be modified to cut down dozens of people in what amounts to an instant.\n\"We are in a culture of death where it's OK if you have an unwanted pregnancy to just go ahead and kill that child,'' she told her colleagues.\nI called Townsend to see if she really thinks that giving a woman a choice on whether to end a pregnancy somehow leads to a Dylann Roof killing nine people during a prayer meeting at a Charleston, S.C., church. Or to a Stephen Paddock killing 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas.\nOr to Nikolas Cruz killing 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\nShe explained that guns have always been around but we haven't had an epidemic of school shootings until recent times, when first-person shooter video games became all the rage and abortion on demand became acceptable.\n\"If we have a disregard for death, like for the x number of abortions we have, it goes along with the culture of the disregard for human life,\" she told me.\nPerhaps, but that culture of death is certainly enhanced when you can reach for your trusty AR-15 and your extended magazines (so much easier to create mass carnage when you don't have to stop to reload).\nBut no need, apparently, to look at changing that.\nStill Townsend raises a valid point \u2013 one that should be studied along with the proliferation of high-powered weaponry. It just won't happen.\nIt used to be that the Centers for Disease Control studied gun violence as a public health concern, in search of a way to prevent these tragedies.\nBut in 1996, Congress amended a spending bill to forbid any federal funds from being used \u201cto advocate or promote gun control.\u201d This, at the request of the NRA after a spate of studies suggested that the presence of guns increased the risk of deaths.\nThat mandate has been added to spending bills every year since 1996.\nThanks to Rep. Townsend, we no longer need to spend money to figure out a way to protect you or me \u2013 or your child or mine.\nJust outlaw abortions and violent video games.\nAs for a ban on bump stocks, those handy devices that attach to AR-15 to boost the body count?\nArizona\u2019s leaders have proclaimed that\u2019s not needed.

Junior Seau does.\nHere's a blast from the past.\nRemember Christian Okoye, the \u201cNigerian Nightmare\u201d? Junior Seau does. As an AFC West defender for the back half of Okoye's all-too-brief, six-year career with the Kansas City Chiefs, Seau was charged with tackling the 6-1, 253-pound running back, who seemingly made the ground shake with every footstep.\nWe bring up Okoye's name because Seau and the rest of the Patriots defense have another rhino-sized runner in their sights. At 6-4, 264, Brandon Jacobs -- the Giants' third-year pro out of mighty Southern Illinois (he transferred from Auburn) -- outdoes Okoye in terms of sheer size.\nHence the stroll down memory lane for Seau, who reports that Okoye is \u201cliving the good life\u201d in California these days, running his own charitable organization.\nJacobs, who outweighs every Patriots linebacker except Adalius Thomas (270), also stands as the single biggest obstacle to the Patriots' pursuit of the first 16-0 regular season in NFL history. Giants' quarterback Eli Manning has been scattershot, and he'll once again be without tight end Jeremy Shockey (out for the year with a broken leg). If the Giants (10-5) are to pull off the upset, they'll have to hitch their wagon to Jacobs and hope he can plow through the Pats' 10th-ranked run defense.\nOf course, that's assuming that Giants coach Tom Coughlin doesn't pull his starters out early.\nNew England has allowed only three 100-yard rushers all season, but two of them have come this month \u2013 Baltimore's Willis McGahee (30 carries for 138 yards) and Pittsburgh's Willie Parker (21-124). Ever since Rosevelt Colvin's injury forced Thomas to move from inside to outside linebacker, the Patriots have appeared vulnerable on the ground. In the 11 games before Colvin went out, opponents averaged 86.2 rushing yards per game and 4.1 yards per carry against the Pats, who were ranked fifth against the run.\nIn four games since the linebacking corps was shuffled \u2013 with the 247-pound Bruschi and the 250-pound Seau locked into the middle -- those numbers have risen to 136.3 yards per game and 5.0 yards per carry.\nNow here comes Jacobs, who should be wearing a license plate instead of a number.\nJacobs was a short-yardage/goal-line back for his first two seasons, during which he scored 16 touchdowns. But Coughlin had no qualms about giving him the full-time load this year after Tiki Barber retired. So far, so good. Jacobs has 944 yards, despite missing five games with knee and hamstring injuries. He's ranked 18th in the league, but only two runners ahead of him average more than his 5.1 yards per carry.\nIn last week's 38-21 road win over the Bills, Jacobs (25-143) and seventh-round rookie Ahmad Bradshaw ("}

Democrats are right to keep playing offense on such matters of policy, especially where Republicans have no coherent response.\nBut the real issue is Trump. Midterm elections are always, at least in part, a referendum on the party in power. Tuesday\u2019s vote is more than that.

But we need them, at the very least, to be capable of feeling empathy and shame. Trump\u2019s supreme egotism and utter shamelessness differentiate him from all previous presidents. They allow him to deliberately divide the country by playing to white-nationalist anxieties. They allow him to warp both foreign and domestic policy for short-term political gain \u2014 and to do so transparently, without the tiniest fig leaf of pretense. They allow him not to care what damage he has wrought, as long as he gets favorable coverage on the cable news shows he watches constantly instead of doing actual work.\nSo now he is threatening to void the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of birthright citizenship by decree, which he cannot possibly do, and to send thousands of troops to the border with Mexico for no reason at all \u2014 except, he hopes, to inflame the anti-immigration spirits of his loyal base. This is not a normal or acceptable way for a president to act. It is like letting a spoiled teenager play around with the nuclear codes.\nVote on Tuesday. When you do, remember Charlottesville. Remember Pittsburgh. Remember how Trump snubs the leaders of friendly democracies and embraces thuggish autocrats. Remember how he always divides, never unites.

The Sooners have found their rhythm since the Texas loss, and are moving full steam ahead in the second half of the season.\nThe Mountaineers are back on track following their first loss of the season. West Virginia picked off Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer three times and ended up with a season high 58 points in the Thursday night victory. The Mountaineers\u2019 Big 12 Championship hopes are on the line this week with a matchup in Austin against the Longhorns.\nTexas suffered its first loss since Week One against Maryland following a failed comeback attempt against the Oklahoma State Cowboys in Stillwater. With a full starting lineup back for the West Virginia game, there is more reason to believe the Longhorns could get back to their winning ways on Saturday.\nTwo things were learned following Oklahoma State\u2019s upset victory against Texas: The Cowboys are really good following a bye week, and head coach Mike Gundy does not care about Twitter. Regardless, Oklahoma State put up 502 yards against perhaps the best defense in the Big 12. Wide receiver Tylan Wallace finished with 222 yards receiving and is beginning to turn heads as one of the more underrated weapons in the Big 12.\nDon\u2019t look now, but the Iowa State Cyclones have won three straight, including two Top 25 victories. The Cyclones are averaging 39.3 points per game during their win streak and have looked like a completely team since their 1\u20133 start to the season. If they can win out, the Cyclones may find themselves in the Big 12 title game. The biggest test of the season comes against Texas, but the Cyclones have to take on Kansas and Baylor before traveling to Austin.\nTexas Tech suffered its third loss of the year this past weekend. The Red Raiders are still lacking consistent quarterback play as Alan Bowman threw three interceptions against the Cyclones. The road only gets tougher for Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s squad, as Tech faces Oklahoma and Texas in the next two weeks.\nThere is no other way to put it: Baylor got whooped Saturday. Baylor allowed a 58 points to West Virginia and turned the ball over four times, a recipe that will likely always result in a loss. Unfortunately for the Bears, they still have Iowa State, Texas Tech and Oklahoma State remaining on the schedule.\nKansas shocked the masses with a victory over Gary Patterson and the TCU Horned Frogs last week to improve to 3\u20135, which is shaping into the Jayhawks\u2019 best season in recent memory. With just one more win this year, Kansas will have it most victories in a season since 2009. Perhaps things are turning around in Lawrence.\nAs for the other team in Kansas, things aren\u2019t looking as bright. The Wildcats are coming off of their worst loss of the season and their fourth loss in the last five games. Kansas State continues to struggle on offense, only scoring over 25 points just three times this season.\nIt is more than surprising to see a Gary Patterson-led team in the bottom of the Big 12 rankings.

Suspensions and fines were also issued for several crew members whose actions were termed \u201cover the line.\u201d Oh, by the way, Jimmie Johnson actually won the race, not that anyone noticed.\nNASCAR certainly got more coverage on TV than it usually gets, with video of the brawl prominently featured on morning and evening news shows for several days.\nI\u2019m sure the NASCAR marketing folks are high-fiving each other for this unexpected attention.\nWith one more race to go in the Eliminator round, you can expect some real fireworks at Phoenix on Sunday. The flat one-mile oval won\u2019t see the high speeds of Texas, so you might see somebody get roughed up a bit, especially if Gordon is having a bad day and decides on a little retaliation. Speaking of Gordon, he has three victories at Phoenix, second only to Harvick who\u2019s first among active drivers with five wins, including three of the last four.\nEdwards has two, including last year\u2019s Chase round. Ryan Newman, Denny Hamlin, and Kenseth have each posted one win at Phoenix, while the two Penske drivers, Keselowski and Joey Logano, are winless there. If another \u201cChase Buster\u201d driver wins tomorrow, the top four in points of the eight remaining Chase drivers is going to advance to the final round. At the moment those four are Logano and Hamlin with 4,072 points each, Newman with 4,070, and Gordon with 4,060.

His former Senate colleagues are rallying behind him amid withering attacks from President Trump.\nPresident Trump is famous for requiring the loyalty of his subordinates. But it&apos;s the loyalty of Republican senators \u2014 not to him but to one of their own \u2014 that is the heart of a simmering showdown between the White House and Congress.\nA growing number of GOP lawmakers appear to have had enough with what one has called the president&apos;s \"public floggings\" in recent days of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a onetime senator from Alabama for served on Capitol Hill for two decades before joining the Trump administration.\nIn an interview Thursday on Fox News&apos; Tucker Carlson Tonight, Sessions said Trump&apos;s remarks had been \"kind of hurtful.\"\nThough the attorney general went out of his way to give to praise the president, saying he and Trump share beliefs and a common interest.\n\"I serve at the pleasure of the president,\" Sessions said, adding that if that should change, \"I&apos;ll be glad to yield at any time.\"\nThat Trump is trying to undermine Sessions seems clear \u2014 the question has been whether the president is trying to force the attorney general&apos;s resignation or simply laying the groundwork for firing him. If Sessions goes, some fear it could be a precursor to another firing \u2014 that of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Department of Justice investigation into the Trump campaign&apos;s possible ties to Russia and Russia&apos;s interference in the 2016 presidential race.\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was blunt. \"If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay,\" he said. \"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\"\nStarting with a New York Times interview published barely a week ago, Trump has kept up a steady drumbeat against Sessions, calling him \"weak\" and \"beleaguered,\" questioning his leadership of the Justice Department and demurring when asked what fate was in store for the attorney general. But mostly the president has expressed unhappiness that the attorney general recused himself from the Russia investigation which laid a stone in paving the way for Mueller&apos;s appointment. Given Sessions&apos; own ties to the Trump campaign, the recusal is something that nearly everyone \u2014 save the president himself \u2014 agrees was necessary and proper.\nGraham&apos;s remarks follow a tweet from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen.

The Senate\u2019s Special Committee on Aging held its first hearing on the rising prices of generic drugs on Wednesday. Subsequent hearings of the bipartisan Senate investigation are planned after the start of the new year.\nThe hearing follows the release on December 1 of a bipartisan report by the Senate Finance Committee based on an 18-month investigation that detailed the high prices of hepatitis C medications. On that same day, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee held a hearing on the topic called for by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\nDoctors, patients, pharmacy benefit managers, company representatives and other experts were called to testify before the Senate committee on Wednesday. The hearing highlighted the parasitic corporate strategies of Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, companies that acquire drugs, primarily off-patent ones open to generic competition, from other firms and then jack up the prices of the medication to reap significant profits.\nThe justified popular anger over rising drug prices is being exploited by politicians of both big parties who pose as opponents of this price-gouging, but in reality have no intention of taking on the giant pharmaceutical industry and its multimillion-dollar congressional lobby.\nThe rising prices raise \u201ctroubling questions about whether companies like Turing and Valeant are taking advantage of the patients who depend on their products for survival,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the top Democrat on the committee.\nA patient whose brain infection was being controlled by the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim (pryimethamine) testified at the hearing. When Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired Daraprim in August, it hiked the price from $13.50 a pill to $750, an increase of more than 5,000 percent. As a result, the patient could no longer access the medication and her brain infection flared up. She only recovered after an expensive hospital stay.\n\u201cHer own cost and the cost to the health system, however, were enormous,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in his written testimony.\nDavid Kimberlin, a doctor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s hospital, testified that the price hike of Daraprim (rising from $1,200 per treatment to \u201cno less than $69,000\u201d) has made it more difficult to care for babies with toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease transmitted through poorly cooked food or cat feces.\nThe disease can be particularly harmful to babies and individuals with weakened immune systems, such as AIDS patients.

{"idx": "14773", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Investigators must be quick-witted and in good physical condition.\nCriminal investigators work in a variety of workplaces, including police departments and federal agencies. A college degree is necessary if you hope to become an investigator in a federal agency, but might not be required for some other jobs. Investigative work requires a variety of skills, including computer skills and knowledge of criminal law.\nStrong investigative skills are one of the key skills required for this job. As an investigator, you review evidence to piece together the chain of events that lead to a crime. You also must understand how to investigate a crime without overlooking evidence or inadvertently destroying the chain of evidence. Investigators interview suspects and witnesses to a crime and examine the scene of the crime for clues and evidence. In some cases, it might take weeks or months until you have enough evidence to make an arrest. During that time, you might gather evidence by conducting surveillance missions, reviewing incriminating records, interviewing experts, examining telephone records and reviewing fingerprint and DNA evidence.\nComputers provide many benefits, but they also make it easier to commit certain crimes, such as credit card fraud. Investigators must have a basic familiarity with computers and be able to use them to access state and national crime databases, complete reports and request information from driver\u2019s license bureaus and other agencies. Large agencies or departments might employ computer technicians to perform more complicated types of work, but you will still be expected to have basic computer skills.\nCriminal investigation can be a dangerous line of work. In order to protect yourself, you must know how to shoot a gun, safely restrain suspects and learn defensive driving techniques. It\u2019s important to understand and follow criminal law. For example, you must understand what types of evidence a judge will require before he will issue you a search warrant. Failing to follow the law can result in dismissal of charges against a perpetrator and end your career as an investigator. You also must learn what to say when you are called upon to testify in a court case.\nCuriosity is particularly important when you work as a criminal investigator. In some cases, it will be very clear how and why a crime occurred, but in others, you\u2019ll use critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning to piece together the clues to determine possible scenarios. Good communications skills also are important. Investigative work requires significant contact with other people, including suspects, witnesses and other departments and agencies. If you are a polite person who can put others at ease, you might be more likely to obtain the information you need than if you behave like the stereotypical bad cop from television shows and movies.\nMcGurgan, Holly. \"What Are the Key Skills for a Successful Criminal Investigator?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/key-skills-successful-criminal-investigator-28597.html.

Rapidly evolving regional strategic realties are now forcing India and Indonesia to coordinate their policies ever more closely and after years of neglect, Jakarta is recognising the role that New Delhi can play in structuring a favourable balance of power in the region.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo had visited India in December 2016 with a promise to elevate India-Indonesia ties. During that visit, the two nations had taken aim at China\u2019s aggressive stance on South China Sea when they \u201cstressed the importance of resolving disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including UNCLOS\u201d. Though both India and Indonesia do not have a direct stake in this dispute, they are concerned about China\u2019s territorial expansionism and its reluctance to abide by global norms. Modi and Widodo also want their nations to emerge as major maritime powers to ensure a stable maritime order in the region, one that is under stress because of China\u2019s rapid rise and America\u2019s growing reluctance to be the sole guarantor of regional security. Where India is worried about the security of the sea lanes of communication in the larger Indo-Pacific, Indonesia has been concerned about Chinese maritime intrusions near the Natuna islands, which it claims as part of its exclusive economic zone, as well as Chinese attempts in the past to include the island chain in its territorial maps.\nIndia and Indonesia are also among the very few fast-growing large economies today. They have been trying to give a major boost to their trade and investment ties by focusing on the areas of oil and gas, renewable energy, information technology and pharmaceuticals. Bilateral trade between the two is expected to grow to $60 billion over the next decade. Both Modi and Widodo are working towards making their respective countries attractive destinations for global investors.\nIndia and Indonesia have been gradually enhancing their security and political ties. The two signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2005 that started an annual strategic dialogue. The next year, they ratified a defence cooperation agreement, initially signed in 2001, which focused on areas of defence supplies and technology, as well as on joint projects. Joint naval exercises and patrols, and regular port calls by their respective navies, have become a regular feature of the India-Indonesia relationship in recent years. India has also become a major source of military hardware for Jakarta.\nSuch cooperation is a natural result of geography.

There's no timetable as yet for introducing the new currency and if the other euro nations decline to adopt their national currencies again, then the new franc would float freely.\"\nSome economists have argued that if Le Pen pursued this strategy, then the \"new franc\" might weaken sharply against the euro.\n\"The new franc would clearly not remain at parity with the euro for very long,\" Jessica Hinds, the European economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. \"The key question, therefore, is what would happen then.\"\n\"To assess this, it is useful to look at France's competitive position. Standard measures include manufacturing unit labor costs, since the bulk of exports are produced by this sector. On this measure, France has fared worse than the euro-zone since 1999. Indeed, the relative increase in France implies that a depreciation of 15% in real terms is needed to restore France's competitiveness to where it was in 1999. However, since other competitiveness measures such as export prices show that France has fared better than the euro-zone over this period, a fall of 5-10% seems more likely.\n\"But a bigger nominal depreciation would be needed. After all, a sudden, sharp drop in the franc would raise import prices, such that higher inflation would partly offset the effects of a depreciation. Granted, the fact that the French economy is fairly closed by eurozone standards might limit imported inflation. Nonetheless, a fall of about 10-15% against the euro appears to be plausible.\"\nOf course, before Le Pen can take France off the euro, she must first win the election.\nThe first round will be held April 23, and the second round will take place May 7.\nRecent opinion polls suggest that it looks increasingly likely that the final showdown in May will be between Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron, who is running as an independent.\nPolls suggest that Le Pen would come out on top in the first round but would be defeated in the second round \u2014 though, of course, things in politics could change quickly."}

Those internal figures have now been disclosed for the first time.\nSomewhat famously, people tend to lose or grow bored with fitness wearables in general. According to a 2013 survey, one-third of users stopped using theirs within six months.\nFitbit said in its S-1 filing it had about 9.5 million \"paid active users\" as of April 1. (For context, since 2007 the company has sold almost 21 million devices, including wristbands and wireless Aria scales.) But the somewhat complicated definition of \"paid active users\" makes it hard to discern just how \"active\" these users are.\nFitbit's definition encompasses people who, within the three months prior to March 31, had an active subscription to Fitbit Premium or the newly acquired FitStar; synced a tracker or scale to a Fitbit account; weighed themselves on a Fitbit scale; or walked at least 100 steps with a tracker. (Users with many devices linked to a Fitbit account were counted only once.) But Fitbits are intended to be a constant part of users' lives, and tracking 100 steps \u2014 about 1/20th of a mile \u2014 on a Fitbit over the course of three months doesn't necessarily translate into long-term consistent use.\nThe Fitbit Zips at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, on Feb. 24, 2014.\nA better, though incomplete, sense of Fitbit's user engagement comes from a startup called Evidation Health. Its platform, AchieveMint, invites people to sync more than 100 fitness apps and devices and rewards them for healthy activities with points that can be converted into cash or merchandise.\n\"Fitbit users are actually really highly engaged,\" said Luca Foschini, Evidation's head of data science, citing data from 20,000 Fitbit users since mid-2010.\nFor BuzzFeed News, Foschini crunched numbers on people Fitbit would consider paid active users. Half of them logged an activity on about 70 of the prior 90 days, he said.\nAnother way to measure retention is the number of people who leave. Of all Fitbit users, 5 percent stop using their device within a week of buying it, and 12.5 percent stop within a month, Foschini said.\nFitbit executives \"actually have a case that the people that buy a Fitbit tend to stick to it, tend to use it,\" Foschini said.\nA Fitbit spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThis isn't a comprehensive picture of all Fitbit users worldwide.

What struck me more than anything else about the London-born musician was the sheer weight and power of his voice, which led me to draw immediate comparisons with \u201860s sensation Otis Reading. Kiwanuka has come a long way since that performance, winning the prestigious BBC Sound of 2012 award earlier this year on the basis of a solitary album, the highly-hyped Home Again, joining the likes of Adele, Ellie Goulding and Mika, all of whom have previously won the award. His debut on Danish soil on Friday night was a show to remember, an experience that makes it easy to see why he is so highly revered within music circles at the moment.\nKiwanuka and his backing band stepped cooly and confidently onto the stage at Lille Vega on Friday, opening the proceedings with several mellifluous tracks off Home Again. His vocals are well and truly the stuff of legend and blended seamlessly with his toned-down instrumentation, which amplified his stage presence in the traditional singer-songwriter fashion. Conversely, more dance-friendly grooves, such as the jazzy 'Bones\u2019, featured a lot more instrumentation and a lot less of Kiwanuka's poignant, slow-paced vocals, giving more of a Friday-night feel to things. What followed was an intense blend of compelling, emotional moments for the better part of the show, punctuated by breaks of soulful brilliance.\nWhilst songs off Home Again were pretty much the order of the day, Kiwanuka did do a Jimi Hendrix cover towards the end of the show, citing him as one of his boyhood inspirations. As expected, the highlight of Friday night's entertainment came right before the close of the proceedings, as Kiwanuka performed \u2018Home Again\u2019, the eponymous single off his album that has captured the hearts and souls of many music lovers the world over. This track alone is a sheer revelation, though Friday's show proved that there's a lot more to Michael Kiwanuka.

In 1999, the port notified the corps about ongoing problems with the jetties, stemming from years of undermining and scouring.\nThe port maintains it's the corps' responsibility to fix the problems, but says it was notified it would have to pay half of the roughly $90 million to $100 million needed for the project.\nThe port later was told it may only have to pay upwards of a fourth of the cost, but in recent years fought to get the corps to cover the entire repair.\nBoyd said he stood by the decision to hire Farenthold both because of the urgent need to address the matter and because Congress appropriated more than $17 billion for Hurricane Harvey damages.\nFarenthold's salary at the port will be $160,000."}
{"idx": "14802", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Why are so many priests alcoholics?\nThe story about the continuing misfortunes of Paul Gascoigne are more than the usual article about a \u201ctroubled\u201d celebrity, or a star fallen on hard times, with which our culture is so obsessed. Rather it is a reminder of the grief caused by alcoholism. Mr Gascoigne is an alcoholic, and his addiction is clearly ruining him, just as it once ruined George Best. Moreover, Mr Gascoigne\u2019s alcoholism must cause distress to his family and his friends, many of whom, no doubt, have tried repeatedly to help him.\nEveryone who has lived inside the institutional church, in a presbytery or a religious house, or a convent, will know about alcoholism, for alcoholism is, historically speaking, often regarded as the curse of the Catholic clergy. I doubt that figures are published or much serious research done into the problem any more, but Catholic priests are more likely to be alcoholic than other men, or so it seems to me. Any attempt to provide scientific backing to such a claim would be bedevilled by the question of just how you measure the incidence of alcoholism. But consider the facts: there are special drying out facilities just for the clergy, or there used to be; the figure of the alcoholic priest is a staple in literature \u2013 consider the \u201cwhiskey priest\u201d in Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory, or even Father Jack in the television series Father Ted; and think of all the priests you may have known who drank too much. And count up the times you heard someone, somewhere, utter the line: \u201cFather X is not an alcoholic, he just likes a drink\u201d or one of the variants thereof.\nWhy are so many priests alcoholic? That is a fairly easy question to answer. There are the pressures of the job, being on call, sometimes for 24 hours a day. There is the simple difficulty of finding it hard to relax without a drink in your hand. There is the culture of drinking that is so common in Catholic milieux: the world of the Catholic social club, or the people always offering you a drink. There is the challenge of loneliness, and the challenge of boredom. And there is the possible genetic predisposition to alcoholism that some of us bear.\nAlcoholic priests do enormous damage to the Church. I think that goes without saying. But what does even worse damage is the way the phalanx of people who surround, protect and enable each alcoholic priest (and these people are never absent), who all deny there is a problem. One can see that Fr X is an alcoholic, but he is surrounded by people who refuse to admit that his is true, which introduces into ecclesial discourse the dangerous disconnect with reality which is the source of so many of our problems. If we cannot face the truth of Fr X\u2019s alcoholism, what truths can we face? If we cannot tackle this problem, how will we ever tackle anything?\nTo tell someone they are an alcoholic is cruel, for it shames them profoundly: it is always shameful to have to acknowledge that you are not free, but rather a slave to your lower impulses. But to leave someone in a state of slavery is much more cruel, and, in the end, will greatly increase the sum of human misery. When a priest drinks too much, that has to be confronted, and the sooner the better. There can be no solution to this or to anything else without acknowledgement of the truth.\nWhy am I writing this, and why now? Partly it is touched off by the pictures of Paul Gascoigne, but it is also because of a concern which we"}

Gavin Newsom has said he wants to build as many as 3.5 million new houses by 2025 to solve California\u2019s housing crisis.\nBut those ambitious goals could be derailed without hundreds of thousands of new construction workers needed to dramatically accelerate the pace of California home building, even assuming that cities agree to zone for more housing and there\u2019s money available to build it all. And it\u2019s hard to imagine, given recent trends, where that many additional workers in the low-wage, high-risk industry would come from.\nNewsom took an early stab at the money question in his first budget, offering $500 million in state funding for middle-income housing, But he wants California\u2019s companies to take on a bigger role funding new homes, and he said he\u2019s already talked with some tech firms that are open to cooperating.\nRamping up housing construction from about 100,000 units in 2016 to 1980s levels \u2014 about 300,000 new homes were built in 1986 \u2014 would require some 200,000 new workers, according to the researcher behind a new study for Smart Cities Prevail, a pro-union nonprofit. But even that influx of workers wouldn\u2019t be enough to meet the goal of 500,000 new houses a year that Newsom floated during his campaign.\n\u201cWorkers are not going to fall out of trees,\u201d researcher Scott Littlehale said.\nLittlehale\u2019s study found that California housing construction isn\u2019t just failing to attract new workers. It\u2019s losing the workers it already has, many of whom are low wage and lower-skilled.\nFrom 2006 to 2017, California lost about 200,000 construction workers. And within the construction trade, many workers are opting for commercial building jobs, which pay more, have better benefits and steadier work.\nDuring the boom building years, the construction industry was \u201cdependent on young workers without a college degree and on immigrant workers,\u201d Littlehale said. Today, both populations are on the decline.\nA brutally honest advertisement for a career in housing construction, according to Little, might read like this: Pay that\u2019s, on average, 24 percent lower than other jobs and few benefits. \u201cOh, by the way, you have a high likelihood of getting injured during the course of that career and you may get laid off,\u201d he said.\nMiguel Diaz, 26, chose construction anyway. He started at 22, doing stints as a painter, carpenter, plumber and electrician. At his last job, he said he was only one of two native English speakers, which helped him earn $20 an hour and steady work. But he said many of his co-workers, who were undocumented or here on work visas, were often paid much less even if they were more experienced, and would go days without work, which can be devastating for workers living paycheck to paycheck.\n\u201cMy dad just said, \u2018Go do something that will make the most money and you won\u2019t have to break your back as much. Use your brain,\u2019\u201d Diaz said.\nSo Diaz, who has a 6-year-old son, applied to become a union electrician in commercial construction.\nDaniel Romero, the assistant business manager of the electrical workers union where Diaz is apprenticing, said starting union wages are about $27 an hour for commercial jobs compared to $17 an hour for residential work.\n"}

Sixth St.\nFor years, Ramler had noticed the house as he drove by it on the way to his own home each day. His renovation of the 1883 structure, which took 18 months, got him noticed: He received a 2018 River Cities Excellence in Preservation Award for the project.\nIt turned out to be a lot bigger undertaking than he anticipated. What he couldn't see on the surface was decades-old termite damage that would necessitate re-framing walls and replacing floor joists. He wound up gutting the house down to the studs, he said. Almost everything has been worked on: The house has new wiring, plumbing, HVAC, roof and gutters; rebuilt exterior walls; and a newly tuck-pointed foundation.\n\"It's a brand-new house now,\" he joked.\nBut in making it new, Ramler brought back many of the home's historic features. Outside, he uncovered wood siding (including the fish-scale siding on the upper floor) that he estimates had been covered with Insulbrick and aluminum siding for some 80 years.\nInside, he removed original trim, had it stripped and put back in. He took out faux beams and drop ceilings that had been added. He uncovered brick that had been plastered over. The list goes on and on.\nWhile preserving the historical details was paramount, Ramler also took steps to make the three-bedroom house more livable. Removing a wall on the lower level created a large kitchen/dining area, complete with a huge quartz island, a window seat and cabinets that Ramler designed alongside a large, 1870s church hutch that he found on Craigslist.\nA small addition created a half bathroom, pantry and side porch on the first floor. Upstairs, it added a laundry area, hallway and a full bathroom in which the home's siding can be seen.\nThroughout the house, Ramler used salvaged items to add character that's in keeping with the historic feel. Wood from another of his projects, a home that dates to 1860, became stair rails. Florentine glass taken from the Hotel Covington went into the bathroom door. He bought old fireplace mantles at Monmouth Street Antique Gallery. Old dressers became vanities in two of the bathrooms.\nRamler actually has a storage unit full of those types of things.\n\"I'm always salvaging stuff wherever I can,\" he said.\nProjects like this renovation are right up his alley. Ramler holds a bachelor's degree in architecture and a master's degree in historic preservation, both from the University of Kentucky. He's been doing this work since before he got either degree. He bought a house in Lexington to rehab during his undergrad days; He'll finish work on his 20th building later this year.\nWhen it comes to that work, he's not one to shy away from a challenge.\n\"The worse they are, the more I'm attracted to a project,\" he said.\nThough the \"urban farmhouse\" had its challenges"}

However, once it got to the point where it started loading windows, it reset. Then it did the same thing again.\nSo, I dialed back to 3.85 Ghz (still with Vcore and CPU Termination at 1.3625 and 1.30, respectively), and tried to boot.\nI'm thinking that the voltage issues are all now squared away, and now I'm perhaps facing a different limitation (memory issue?).\nI'm still at 2.40B, with 5 5 5 15 timings, all as per my last BIOS posting.

An additional deduction up to Rs 50,000 is offered for investment in National Pension System (NPS).\n\u201cThere is intent to give tax relief to as many taxpayers as possible, but a higher deduction will mean loss of revenue so the exact quantum of the relief will depend on the government\u2019s fiscal elbowroom,\u201d said another government official.\nWith rising global crude prices putting pressure on the government\u2019s subsidy bill, depressed collections from Goods and Services Tax (GST) in its first year and the need to increase spending in infrastructure, the government has to be cautious with populist measures if the path of fiscal consolidation is to be maintained.\n\u201cA higher tax deduction for investment in government infrastructure projects would mean more money will be channelised into these projects and in capital markets.

He's 10 times likelier to stay where he is. In fact, statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina, but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies...\"\nObama's speech highlights a major challenge for many governments and non-government organisations worldwide \u2014 the fact that millions of people have far in excess of their needs, while millions of others struggle to survive. In the United States, close to 40 million people live in poverty, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, the gap between the rich and poor is the widest in the world.\nIn a 2011 report by the International Monetary Fund, Jamaica ranks second worst, behind Suriname, among 23 countries in the Americas on the unequal distribution of income measure.\nUnsurprisingly, we do not talk about the wealth gap, less we offend the wealthiest among us. Further, it carries the worrying spectre that some of us may have to give up something \u2014 such as modifying our vulgar excesses and paying our employees a living wage. It may raise inconvenient questions about the massive profits made by some banks, for example, while imposing onerous fees on the working poor just to maintain an account.\nSo we talk about poverty instead.\nAbstractly, we love the poor. Concretely, we resent the youngsters at the stoplight trying to wash our windscreens in the hope that we may toss them a buck. We are contemptuous of the woman with the three children holding on to her skirt and an unborn protruding from her stomach.\nIt is this uncontrolled breeding that it is responsible for her poverty, we say, ignoring common sense and every evidence which shows that the more women are gainfully employed, the fewer children they have. Further, the more that men are gainfully employed, the less crime there is in society. The less crime there is, the greater the chance of economic growth.\nPersonal responsibility is critical, but depraved social and economic conditions inevitably breed certain kinds of behaviour.\nMandela knew this. He said: \"Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. Like slavery and Apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.\"\nIn a progressive country, such actions might include strategies to reduce the wealth gap, educating and empowering people to take responsibility for their lives, proper stewardship of existing resources, and engineering a legislative environment conducive to economic growth.\nTransport and Works Minister Dr Omar Davies, in his defence of the trans-shipment port proposed for Goat Islands, a protected area, identifies poverty as the greatest threat to the environment.

In US parlance, that makes them the first expansion team to win a major league title in their first season of existence. Many might think that the league would be disappointed \u2013 or even embarrassed \u2013 that its title can be won by a team assembled so recently. Not on your life.\nThe Fire, like the other 11 teams that comprise the MLS, are the result of years of planning, focus-groups and consultation with marketing wallahs to create an entertainment \u201cpackage\u201d suited to their local audience. So Chicago, with the largest concentration of Polish people anywhere outside Warsaw, gets three experienced Polish footballers to add to their squad. Piotr Nowak \u2013 acquired from 1860 Munich \u2013 was the hero of the hour, running DC\u2019s defence ragged, setting up the first goal and taking the shot that was deflected in for the second, just before half time.\nChicago, like each MLS club, is permitted five foreigners on their roster of 22 players \u2013 although that is being reduced to four next season. The rest are made up of young players straight out of college and those that played at one of the ten teams that made up the MLS for the first two years, before \u201cfranchises\u201d- as they are unfortunately known \u2013 were established in Miami and Chicago for this season.\nRather like a handicapper in horse racing, parity is what the MLS authorities are looking for. Through the draft system, whereby the worst team from the previous year gets the first choice of the best college players for next year, and by rejigging of rosters, teams like the Colorado Rapids can bounce back from the worst record in the inaugural 1996 season to reaching the final against DC Utd the following year.\nIf the authorities waited until grass-roots organizations had formed themselves into coherent football clubs, the game would never get off the ground in the States and the TV companies certainly would not be interested. As it was, DC Utd entered the MLS Cup final as the favourites to win their third title and begin some sort of dynasty (as the American media were calling it, in their desperate urge to create a history for the fledgling league), however short-lived. DC had, after all, beaten Chicago twice during the regular season, both times coming from behind.\nDC Utd, along with the Los Angeles Galaxy, played by far the best football in their respective conferences (eastern and western) and a final between those two would have been an MLS marketing man\u2019s dream, especially as it was to be played in the Rose Bowl,the site of the 1994 World Cup final.

Previously, Kirk had said he \u201ccertainly would\u201d support Trump if he was the nominee. Kirk told reporters that instead he would cast a write-in vote for the retired Gen David Petraeus in November.\nRyan has been fiercely criticised in some quarters for caving in and endorsing Trump last week, despite the candidate\u2019s extreme positions. Soon after he did, Trump claimed that a US district judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a case alleging that Trump University exploited students, cannot judge him fairly because he is of Mexican heritage and Trump wants to build a wall between the US and Mexico.\n\u201cI regret those comments that he made,\u201d Ryan said on Tuesday. \u201cClaiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment I think that should be absolutely disavowed. It\u2019s absolutely unacceptable.\nLater on Tuesday afternoon, Trump responded to the barrage of criticism. \u201cIt is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.\nTrump accused the media of misreporting the case and insisted that he was fighting to stop companies moving production to Mexico, while drugs and illegal immigrants were \u201cpouring across our border\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage.\nTrump does not intend to comment on the case further, he said.\nThe questions for Ryan came after 25 minutes of speeches in which the House speaker paid tribute to Shirley Holloway, founder of the House of Help City of Hope residence, and joined several House committee chairmen in arguing for a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach to beating poverty rather than \u201ctop down\u201d welfare programmes.\nWhatever their qualms about him as a loose canon, Trump is ultimately seen as the pragmatic choice by Ryan and senior Republican allies to maintain party unity, win elections and implement their vision.\nRyan had had an \u201cexhaustive\u201d discussion with Trump personally about anti-poverty policies, he added, \u201cand that is why I believe that we are far better off advancing these policies, getting them into law, with his candidacy than we clearly are with Hillary Clinton\u201d.\nBut asked about Trump\u2019s refusal to back down on his comments about Judge Curiel, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential nominee said: \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong.

The Nook is already starting to look like the real internet to the Kindle\u2019s AOL.\"\nDestined for the Dustbin At the Business Insider, Peek.com CEO Amol Sarva doubts the Nook's ability to make up for ground already claimed by the Kindle.

Finally, he's not so sure offering the device in bookstores is even the way to go: \"You know who the #1 online electronics/gadgets retailer is? Not Barnes & Noble.

{"idx": "14823", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The expected boom in demand for small, often isolated devices in the Internet of Things is driving developers to craft new types of components.\nTwo developments announced this week should help IoT come together. At a trade show in Tokyo, researchers showed off a prototype of a tiny power supply that harvests energy from vibrations in the air so remote sensors and other parts don't need batteries. And on Thursday, U.K. chip company Imagination Technologies announced a design for radio chips that can be used in small, power-sipping devices.\nIoT promises to feed data from machines and sensors everywhere to systems that can deliver reports or automatically make changes in public or private infrastructure. To do that, the emerging network has to get into places that wires, cables and support teams can't easily reach, especially if those remote devices number in the millions. That makes size and power requirements stricter than ever.\nOne emerging technology to power standalone devices in the field is vibration harvesting, or generating electricity from movements in the environment. It can use a variety of sources, including wind, water, radio waves and human movement. For example, the motion of a person walking might help to power a small wearable device.\nAt the Techno-Frontier conference in Tokyo, researchers from Europe and Japan are showing off a prototype built around an electrostatic vibration harvester from Japanese automation vendor Omron with power management electronics from European research institution Holst Centre/imec. Combining the two technologies allowed them to build a vibration-based power supply that's much smaller than current models, the partners said. The DC power module they built measures 5 centimeters by 6 centimeters and may be able to shrink down to just 2 square centimeters.\nThe prototype is going through testing and customer input before volume production. It could be substituted for batteries in current designs or used in totally new products, the partners said.\nThe power supply is intended for wireless sensors for industrial applications such as equipment control and predictive maintenance. The sensors themselves could be \"set and forget\" devices with little need for maintenance because they wouldn't need replacement batteries. The researchers' design could be tuned for power output between 1.5 volts and 5 volts, the partners said.\nLike Omron and Holst, chip architecture vendor Imagination is addressing small, wirelessly connected things. Its Ensigma Series4 \"Whisper\" RPU (radio processing unit) architecture extends the company's Ensigma line with a design geared to low power consumption more than high performance, said Richard Edgar, director of communications technology marketing. Rather than a chip itself, it's a blueprint for chip makers to design processor cores.\nThe Whisper architecture can be used for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Classic, low-power Bluetooth Smart, NFC (near-field communications), GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and other current or emerging wireless technologies. Imagination already sells the Ensigma Explorer architecture for devices such as set-top boxes that need high speed, but it designed the Whisper technology for equipment that will never send big streams of packets.\n\"For IoT, the criteria are different,\" Edgar said. \"It's small amounts of data, occasionally.\" For example, a temperature sensor in a home might take readings every 15 minutes and send a few hundred bytes. Whisper might also be used in industrial sensors, wearable devices or smart electrical grids, he said.\nWhisper is designed for use in chips built with the MIPS architecture, which Imagination acquired in 2012. It can be implemented in a MIPS chip specifically for communications or built into a"}

But the governor and his allies are putting pressure on the board that oversees elections.\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to face a recall election next year.\nMore than 200,000 Wisconsinites have pledged to join the effort to remove the radically anti-labor governor and pro-recall groups have announced plans to begin circulating the petitions November 15. Even the governor\u2019s aides admit that it is all but certain that the groups will collect far more than the 540,000 signatures that are required to force the governor to face a new election next spring.\nAnd the numbers don\u2019t look good for Walker.\nPolling shows that a solid majority of Wisconsin voters disapprove of the governor\u2019s performance, with overwhelming majorities of Democrats and independents favoring his removal. Among self-identified independent voters, a group that favored Walker by a 56-42 margin last November, the split in now 52 percent for recalling the governor to 36 percent for keeping him. Internal polling, which pits the governor against a variety of potential challengers, has him running poorly even against contenders who have never before run statewide races.\nThose are nightmarishly bad numbers for a politician who got a taste of the trouble he was in last winter, when his effort to undermine collective bargaining rights for public employees, fill civil service positions with political cronies and undermine local democracy were greeted with some of the largest pro-labor demonstrations in modern American history.\nSo how does Walker intend to prevail?\nBy gaming the election process.\nSpecifically, Walker and his legislative allies have in recent weeks placed enormous pressure on the state Government Accountability Board\u2014which oversees elections\u2014to refrain from writing rules that might make the recall process easier.\nThe pressure tactics included consideration by the state\u2019s Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules of a proposal to shift final authority over whether GAB rules are implemented to the governor.\nThat change would create an autocrat\u2019s dream scenario. Strongmen and political bosses have always mused that what matters is not who casts the votes but who counts them. What has the potential to matter even more, however, is who decides how everything about an election\u2014the petitioning, the voter registration, the voter-identification rules, the vote counting, the recounting, everything\u2014goes down. That\u2019s what Walker would have if were to gain control of the rule-making process regarding recalls.\n\u201cAllowing Governor Walker to veto any recall rule from the GAB that he doesn\u2019t like, for an election that affects him personally, is the definition of an abuse of power. Gov. Walker and legislative Republicans know that they are in trouble with Wisconsin\u2019s working, middle-class families because of their extreme agenda. But rather than let the voice of the people be heard, Republicans are trying to control the recall election rules in favor of Governor Walker,\u201d argued Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha.\nBarca\u2019s was aghast at the takeover proposal, and rightly so.\nWith the mere threat of a gubernatorial takeover looming, the GAB backed off on a rule change that Republicans said would have made it easier to gather recall petition signatures. The board is also reconsidering a rule change that would have made it possible for students to avoid some of the most cumbersome challenges created by the state\u2019s new Voter ID law.\nAfter the GAB backed down last week, the governor"}

Apparently, it's created quite a shortage of kosher meat. A big part of the controversy is the slaughter practices, which, at least according to PETA activists, violate the spirit if not the letter of kashrut.\nI wonder if this doesn't have some connection to the weekend's discussion of rules-vs-principles based regulation. Kosher law is incredibly detailed, in part because rabbis were trying to do what my religious studies professor called \"building a wall around the torah\"--setting up one's life so that it is almost impossible to accidentally violate a commandment. So the original prohibition against boiling a kid in the milk of its mother becomes a set of very elaborate rules designed to make sure that no specks of milk and meat ever come into contact in one's digestive system.\nFor the unscrupulous, this opens up an area of opportunity. The original kosher slaughter laws were designed to, among other things, minimize the suffering of the animals. But they predated the assembly line, when speed became profit. So now a slaughterhouse can hoist an animal up by ropes and hang it upside down to make it bleed out faster, while still arguing that it has not violated kosher law. In letter, yes. In spirit, this seems to obviously violate the principle that one should minimize animal suffering.\nOf course, various Jewish communities constantly debate and update laws for just this reason. But just as with government regulation, the rules will always be a little behind the clever bastards looking for loopholes. Whereas if the slaughterhouses were required to stick to the objective of making the animals suffer as little as possible, it would be pretty clear that a lot of these practices flunked the test."}

At today\u2019s climate talks in Paris, 18 countries and 60 organizations formed a new alliance aimed at doing just that.\nAccording to the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, existing technology\u2014from solar cells and combined heating and cooling plants, to low-carbon concretes and intelligent cooling systems\u2014could help the building and construction industry save 3.2 gigatons of CO2 every year.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind a new alliance, announced earlier today, in which 18 countries from around the world\u2014including the U.S., France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Sweden and more\u2014commit to speeding up their attempts to reduce the emissions produced by the construction and use of buildings.\nThose countries will also be joined by 60 other organizations, ranging from professional groups for architects to construction industry trade organizations. Those include the International Union of Architects, the Royal Institution of Charted Surveyors, and the European Construction Industry Federation.\nThe new alliance will try to tackle some broad problems: it will minimize energy demand in buildings, reduce the carbon emissions associated with manufacturing building materials, and demand that cities take a more integrated approach to building design and urban planning. It will also seek to use more local materials, which consume less energy for transport.\nIn the longer term, the alliance will push to make buildings that contribute to the greater good of a city or community\u2013for example, buildings that actually contribute energy back into the grid. \u201cFrom a technical standpoint, we know how to produce buildings that don\u2019t consume energy\u2014but we could also construct energy positive buildings, too,\u201d said de Chalendar."}

In late September, the Palestinian Authority switched to winter time, but the West Bank\u2019s Israeli settlers continued living in line with Israel\u2019s clock, which only made the switch today. Thus, for one month, the West Bank became the only place in the world where time is not delineated by geography but rather by ethnicity: different people went about their lives on different clocks, despite the fact that they live in such close proximity to each other within the same territory.\nIn other words (For the sake of clarifying such strange reality, I add here with thanks a point used in the comments by reader Haifawi) a visitor to the West Bank would be in a different time zone, depending on whether he or she was with Jews or non-Jews.\nSettlers today make up over 15 percent of the West Bank population. This means that about every sixth West Bank resident thought an hour ahead of the other five. Drivers passing each other on Route 60 drove in different time zones, depending on the color of their license plates. Meanwhile, while Israelis on both sides of the Green Line shared the same clock, the Palestinian people was divided in, and by, the dimension of time. Palestinians in Israel and East Jerusalem continued to live according to Israeli time, while Gaza went with Ramallah, switching off daylight savings on September 26.\nThe lives of West Bank Palestinians who work in settlements or with Israelis, or who have any connection at all with Palestinian citizens of Israel or East Jerusalem residents, became highly complicated. Some of them moved between time zones a few times a day. Many had to wake up at unthinkable hours in order to travel to work across the wrinkle of time. Palestinians who live on one side of the separation barrier and work on the other must anyway calculate the travel time to the checkpoint and the wait at it; this month they were forced to add an extra hour to that.\nIronically, the PA\u2019s early change to winter time was meant to provide synchronicity with Israel. In recent years, Israel\u2019s religious Jewish parties pushed for summer time to end ahead of the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, in order to shorten the fast and ease the lives of the faithful. This year, with no ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, the date was changed at the last moment. The Palestinians did not adhere to the change, perhaps fearing that a further Israeli change of heart would force them to switch the date once more, and the bizarre delay was created.\nIn my work as tour guide, I moved between the two clocks all month. Often I was joined by dozens of tour participants, headed from Jerusalem to meet a speaker in Hebron or Nablus, at an hour on which no one was clear. The experience was annoying at times, funny at others. It was far more tolerable than other phenomena of the occupation, but around these parts we long ago learned to cheer the tiniest changes for the better. Today, with the synchronizing of the clocks, such change has occured: the rate of absurdity dropped by a tick.\nDuring the first Intifada, the United Leadership introduced a different timezone for Palestine. This caused endless problems for those of us working, or trying to, on both sides of the Green Line.\nInteresting that you never mention the 50% ("}

{"idx": "14836", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon is a skilled and sophisticated politician, but when it comes to anything connected with economic policy he adheres to a simple principle: How much money can we give back to the public?\nHe discovered the magic of lowering the cost of living five years ago when he was communications minister and ordered reforms of the cellular market that lowered rates by the tens of percent and made it easier for new companies to compete.\nSince then he has tried to repeat his earlier success. There was the Family Net program, which reduced duties and purchase taxes on baby clothing, shoes and cellphones and subsidized afternoon programs for children. Then there was Machir LMishtaken, in which the government effectively subsidized land costs to bring down housing prices.\nNow there is Mondays Net Reductions program to eliminate customs and purchase taxes on a wide variety of consumer products \u2013 some 800 million shekels ($227 million) in potential savings for ordinary Israelis.\nYou can hardly say an unkind word about a finance minister who wants to lower duties and the purchase tax on electronics, apparel, lighting fixtures and bring down the cost of living in the process. But there are a couple of points everyone should be paying attention to before they sing his praises.\n1. The savings from eliminating customs and purchase taxes is supposed to be passed on to the consumer, but they are likely to get stopped along the way in the pockets of importers, The treasurys solution is to frame them as an emergency order for one year. If at the end of the year, the consumer isnt seeing lower prices, the orders will be rescinded. That should be a warning to importers who are thinking of exploiting the situation. Officials had thought about lowering duties on air conditioners but didnt because the market is concentrated and the risk that the savings wouldnt be passed on were too big.\n2. Kahlon has worked hand to create the image of a finance minister who thinks about the cost of living for ordinary Israelis. There are a lot of ways to accomplish this and playing with the purchase tax is among the easiest. There are harder ways to do it, too, like undertaking reforms, making the public sector more efficient, reducing red tape and regulation and investing in innovation and productivity. But that involves battling vested interests and Kahlon doesnt want to fight them.\n3. Lowering customs is supposed to boost the economy by boosting consumer spending. But economists think the better way to foster economic growth is via exports and investment. The Israeli economy doesnt have a consumer-spending problem; the figure has grown sharply in recent years thanks to low unemployment and interest rates.\n4. There has been no shortage of talk about Kahlons problem of excess government revenues in the last few months and what to do with them. Most of the discussion is moot: The excess will go to paying down government debt and only a small part will be given back to the public. Net Reduction was just the first installment, The next, more complicated one is how Israel should respond to the planned cut in the U.S. corporate tax to 20% from 35%. Kahlon would prefer tax cuts for the middle class and small business, but Trump is upsetting his plans by forcing Israel to match the U.S. A tax cut for big companies will dwarf everything Kahlon did today."}

While data available at kenpom.com shows Siena still with a bottom-50 defense nationally when adjusted for possessions, the Saints rank No. 1 in the MAAC since conference play started. Overall this season, Siena has allowed 110.9 points per 100 possessions on the defensive end \u2014 but that number drops to a league-best 93.8 in the Saints\u2019 seven conference games.\nFiguring out those jobs? Largely, that has been Maciariello\u2019s task.\n\u201cCoach Carm\u2019s done a great job just preparing these guys defensively,\u201d Siena head coach Jamion Christian said after the Saints\u2019 best defensive effort of the season came in a 53-40 win against Manhattan in which the Jaspers scored 0.75 points per possession and shot 15 of 41.\nThat defensive effort was part of a recent trend in which the Saints have held their last four opponents to fewer than 1.00 points per possession. In Siena\u2019s first 16 games, the Saints accomplished that benchmark only three times.\nFor the majority of the season, Siena played a matchup zone defense and pressed whenever it could. That changed several games ago, as the Saints have become a man-to-man team that rarely extends its defense beyond half court.\nIn half-court sets, Siena struggled within its matchup zone to defend corner 3-pointers on a consistent basis. The switch to man-to-man has eliminated that issue, and Siena senior Evan Fisher provided an answer as to why that\u2019s been the case.\nWhile that strategy switch has helped the Saints with their on-court communication, Maciariello assigned much of Siena\u2019s improvement to its level of confidence \u2014 and comfort \u2014 with the program\u2019s coaching staff as the season has continued.\nChristian said this season\u2019s Saints are the first team he has encountered that enjoy the defensive sections of practice more than the offensive ones.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when everybody goes crazy,\u201d said Siena freshman Jalen Pickett, who secured Monday his fifth consecutive MAAC Rookie of the Week award.\nPickett leads the Saints in steals with 2.2 per game ahead of their game Thursday at Monmouth. The star freshman said his prowess in playing passing lanes is a credit to Maciariello.\n\u201cCoach Carm does a great job of going over the other team\u2019s plays in scouts and putting us in the right positions to anticipate and just play the passing lanes,\u201d Pickett said.\nWhere credit belongs, though, is not a concern for Maciariello and the Saints.\nContinuing to get stops at a high level is the priority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to be a part of something like this where nobody worries about who is getting the credit,\u201d Maciariello said."}

Festival programmers maintain that they don't pick female filmmakers on purpose \u2014 it just always seems to work out that way.\nFor whatever reason, indies are more friendly toward diverse voices.

{"idx": "14859", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Lenovo revamped its data center strategy, launched a bevy of products, and set out to be the No. 1 supercomputing vendor. Here's a look at the plan.\nLenovo launched 14 server platforms, seven storage systems, and five network switches in one swoop and laid out its data center battle plan. Now the big question: Will Lenovo's big data center push pay off?\nAfter assessing Lenovo's products and strategy, and interviewing execs, it's apparent that the company has one thing it hasn't had since acquiring IBM's x86 server business in 2014: A comprehensive plan. Lenovo has aligned its sales, supply chain and customer focus behind a new leadership team led by Kirk Skaugen, an Intel alum now president of the data center unit.\nLenovo laid out a few key goals. It wants to be the No. 1 supercomputing company. Lenovo says it's legacy free. And Lenovo's supply chain churns out servers as fast as it can PCs. In other words, Lenovo can compete with the white-box manufacturers favored by the hyperscale cloud providers and offer enough intellectual property and reliability to land large enterprises.\nHowever, Lenovo trails Dell Technologies and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and has to contend with Cisco as well as IBM in many areas.\nWhen I asked Skaugen what he meant by legacy free, the data center head clarified. To Lenovo, legacy free means that it can run to software defined infrastructure because it doesn't have to sell you another storage or networking system. There's no legacy business to protect. \"What we hear in every single account is that CIOs don't want to buy one more legacy xyz,\" he said. \"We don't have to push an old product one more generation.\"\nCouple that lack of legacy with a supply chain shipping 4 devices a second and Lenovo can compete on price as well as technology.\nAdd it up and here are a few reasons why Lenovo could grow its data center business.\nFocus. When Lenovo bought IBM's x86 server business it decided to use a centralized sales approach. All that move did was ensure that the data center unit didn't get the attention it needed as 90 percent of sales went to PCs. Now Skaugen has a dedicated data center sales team and noted that he has been able to staff up quickly given HPE's H3C joint venture in China and Dell's acquisition of EMC. Simply put, there are talented enterprise sales folks on the market. \"We have more detailed interaction with the customer and product definition,\" said Skaugen. \"We're starting with what does the customer need.\"\nAgility. Lenovo is a large company, but on the data center front it's smaller than HPE or Dell Technologies. Skaugen argued that Lenovo has a more simple menu and can make sales and product decisions quickly.\nScale. Lenovo has economies of scale because it secures its own commodities and makes its motherboards. That manufacturing control means that it can compete with contract manufacturers on price. \"We are not afraid of high volume and low margin,\" said Skaugen. \"We're supplying all of the hyperscalers with deep engineering collaboration.\"\nIntegration. Lenovo has now integration with the IBM assets and its own gear. Lenovo sold servers before as well as networking gear in China. The integrated ThinkAgile systems combine Lenovo's hardware and network operating system and management tools. Nutanix drives the software defined storage.\nThe ability to fill in gaps. Skau"}

But still, that's not very often \u2014 just 45 times since 2013 \u2014 because it is such a difficult charge to prove.\nCompare that with Philadelphia, with 1,217 deaths last year, and seven DDRD charges in the last five years.\n\"It's just not that useful of a tool,\" said Ben Waxman, a spokesman for Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, because so many people are buying and selling drugs in the city, it is virtually impossible to attach one person to one fatal dose.\nMontgomery and Bucks Counties have leveled the charge 15 and 23 times since 2013.\nYork prosecutors say they view DDRD as a tool to fight an epidemic and respect families who need solace. With its conservative voter base, York may seem a natural place for a get-tough measure criticized by some as a relic of failed \"war on drugs\" tactics.\nKevin Cruz-Cuebas, seen here in a mugshot from York County prison, was charged with drug delivery resulting in death after selling a fatal dose of heroin to Ryan Myers, 30, in late 2016.\nYet York also demonstrates the tension between frustration and compassion that has punctuated the crisis, with volunteers handing out clean needles, life-saving naloxone, and treatment referrals to people in addiction.\nStill, as the death rates have risen, so have the prosecutions.\nFor selling Ryan Myers his last dose of heroin, Kevin Cruz-Cuebas faced up to 40 years in prison.\nIn the fall of 2013, a few months before York County Coroner Pam Gay took office, her new deputy told her to keep an eye on heroin overdoses. By mid-January 2014, overdose deaths were on track to surpass the toll from all of 2013.\n\"I never anticipated walking into the worst drug epidemic in the history of the United States,\" Gay said. She quickly decided to do something about it.\nGay began performing autopsies on each person who overdosed on illicit drugs. She and District Attorney David Sunday, who was then a chief prosecutor overseeing drug felonies, formed a heroin task force and spent months persuading the county's 23 police departments \u2014 many of which rarely handle major investigations \u2014 to treat every overdose like a crime scene.

My goals at the beginning of 2016 were to sing live at least once (I had never performed live in Nashville at that point in time and I wound up singing at 8 events last year); to write at least 30 new songs (I wrote 75), to find great producers to record songs I had written from 2015 that I thought were strong (one of which I released last Christmas called \u201cBox It Up\u201d an original holiday song I wrote with Clayton Jones of the band Madison Letter and had produced by Josh Sudduth of the band Relient K, several others are now on my EP LOUD).\nI spent much of 2016 doing cover songs with the producer of the band The Queen & King (their covers had amassed millions of plays on Spotify) something I semi-regret doing, because I did not want to be thought of as a cover artist; however, I enjoyed reinterpreting my favorite songs in a series of Free Downloads I called \u201cUnder the Covers\u201d and creating elaborate music videos (if you watch my video for Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cWhat Do You Mean\u201d and Estelle\u2019s \u201cAmerican Boy\u201d) which I later applied to my own original music videos.\nSo far 2017 has been off to a great start.

{"idx": "14864", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The British photographer John Stewart is still active at the age of nearly 95. His extraordinary life has seen Japanese PoW camps, encounters with Picasso and Matisse, and a long stint shooting the fashion and business elite of New York. He's also won acclaim as one of the finest practitioners of the still life. Hugh Schofield met John Stewart at his home in southern France.\nThere are not many people who can recall walking along Avenue Foch in 1930s Paris, wearing badge lapels of the right-wing leagues that proliferated in those tense political times.\nEven more surprising is to hear the reminiscence from the mouth of an Englishman.\n\"Everything was very political back then, and everyone in my very posh lycee belonged to one right-wing club or another.\n\"I was with the Croix-du-Feu, which counted as left-wing compared to the other lot, who were royalists.\n\"But when we went out we would wear both insignia - one of them inverted. Then if we bumped into the royalists, we could change them over and pretend we were with them!\"\nSpeaking with John Stewart brings back the past in such vivid detail, you need to collect yourself to remember that these events took place 80 years ago.\nHis English is very lightly accented with French - testament to the mixed influences of his youth and a life now lived mainly in Paris and Provence. It is also peppered with the occasional Wodehouse-ism. He never goes, he tootles.\nHe was born in 1919. His maternal grandfather was founder of the Gestetner copying fortune, and his father was the company's representative in France. It was originally hoped that John too would enter the business - but he had other ideas.\nThe memories flood out over lunch. In 1937 he got his baccalaureate and went to the UK, where he wangled a job as stockbroker at Rothschild's Bank.\nWith other members of the London \"jeunesse doree\" he joined the 332nd Anti-aircraft Company of the Royal Engineers, which seems to have combined searchlight duties with alcohol-fuelled high jinks around the Home Counties.\n\"Remind me to tell you about John Gielgud's bathtub,\" gives the flavour.\nWith the outbreak of war, things got more serious. With fluent French, Stewart was trained as an undercover agent and sent to Syria to help in the fight against Vichy. But his ship was diverted to Singapore - at the worst possible time. In February 1942, Singapore fell to the Japanese and Stewart was a prisoner of war.\n\"Early on I had a dream - that I would be in captivity for three-and-a-half years. Afterwards I counted the days, and it was exactly that.\n\"That dream I took as a message of the potential for survival. I asked myself - what is most needed here? And I realised that for 100,000 men there were only seven Japanese speakers. So I decided to learn Japanese and become an interpreter. It saved my life.\"\nStewart believes he is now the last living survivor from one of the worst camps on the notorious Burma railway, Sonkrai.\n\"When the cholera came it was pitiful. When you went to sleep you never knew if the man in the next bed would be alive in the morning. You didn't know if you yourself would be on the funeral pyre by the end of the next day.\n\"No-one"}

{"idx": "14867", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If the IoT solution you are considering for your business requires any kind of rip and replace, maybe you should think twice before taking the plunge as your existing infrastructure is actually smarter than you think.\nThe past few years have seen increasing pressure for businesses, regardless of industry, to undergo a digital transformation. Amidst all the talk about connected devices, big data and business intelligence, businesses are being bombarded with the message \u2018disrupt or be disrupted\u2019. Recent research has revealed that 81 per cent of CIOs believe legacy systems are having a negative impact on their businesses, but although there is clearly a case for infrastructure investment, the need to disrupt needn\u2019t be tantamount to huge expenditure. If the Internet of Things (IoT) solution you are considering for your business requires any kind of rip and replace, maybe you should think twice before taking the plunge as your existing infrastructure is actually smarter than you think.\nThe Internet of Things is at the heart of most digital transformation strategies \u2013 streamlining processes and improving efficiencies. Over the past 12 to 18 months, organisations across every market have embarked upon pilot IoT deployments to prove the value of the data derived from a vast array of devices and sensors. These initial deployments have opened the eyes of businesses to the potential of IoT, but the question many are faced with is how to roll this out effectively across the business, balancing the benefits of IoT data with the cost of implementation.\nFor those looking to reap the rewards of the Internet of Things, ripping out supposedly out-dated systems and replacing them with brand new, state of the art facilities won\u2019t necessarily do the business any favours. Not only will this exercise be extremely costly, but it will also remove the infrastructure that is already there \u2013 infrastructure that holds a mountain of data that can be put to work improving the business.\nThe potential business benefits of the Internet of Things are truly transformational. It not only has the ability to increase productivity, streamline efficiencies and save money, but for companies that are able to get their IoT deployment right, it has the potential to generate additional revenues by adding value to the business\u2019s core purpose. For many businesses, this concept is fantastic in principle, but the question is how many are willing to explore this potential if there is a huge initial investment attached to it?\nTake refrigeration and cooling with the food retail industry as an example. It seems unlikely that replacing every in-store fridge, freezer or food delivery van is going to appeal to a multiple retailer whose core business focus is selling produce, as the cost will far outweigh the immediate benefits. For businesses undergoing digital transformation, they need a way to roll-out IoT without incurring huge upfront costs that will delay the company seeing a return on its investment. Rather than investing in brand new equipment, the answer lies in existing infrastructure. The data that is an increasingly vital part of many enterprises\u2019 digital strategies is already being generated, businesses simply need a way of extracting, understanding it and releasing its value.\nThe food retail industry candidly admits that supply chain complexity has meant it is easier and safer to chill all food to the lowest required temperature meaning an annual over-chill by millions of degrees. Typically, in a store environment, refrigerated cases are all set to one standard very cold setting in order to ensure items that are highly temperature sensitive, for example meat, can be sold safely. However, not only does this approach use excess energy, but chilling all produce at such low temperatures can have a detrimental effect on certain items. Take yoghurt for example, over-cooling squeezes the product, resulting in the familiar, yet distinctly unappealing watery layer on top"}

When we put on the full armor God has provided, we are a force to be reckoned with.\"\nThis day, as I sat pondering ideas for my column, I was drawn to one I had written four years ago this very week. I believe the wisdom within bears repeating once again, as we continue to make our way on this incredible, challenging, fulfilling, crazy, magnificent, trying journey called life. So this day, I pray that, as you read these words, you find strength for the day at hand, encouragement for the trials, hope for the future, and peace in the midst of the storms \u2014 and faith, above all else, let there be faith. Shalom.\nI watched with fascination as a mama bird began to make a nest in our pear tree in the front yard, gliding in with sticks, twigs and bits of tattered tissue and fabric until at last the nest was ready. Not long after, the mama filled that perfect little home with precious little eggs, and then settled in to guard, to watch and to wait. Bless her heart, that mama had her work cut out for her. Her little babies were peeping from the moment they chipped away and emerged from their shells. Thus began the next part of that mama\u2019s challenge \u2014 the delivery of nourishment for those hungry mouths (beaks), open wide to receive bugs and worms and stuff like that.\nWell, even our big dogs that had been very interested only moments before felt intimidated by the rescuers and wandered away. Free of threats from the world of our front yard, that mama and her friends began to nudge and urge that little squirt up into the high branches of the bushes, tucked out of sight and out of reach, no human assistance required. He lingered there a while and bit by bit, he began to test his wings and, once he felt sure that they were ready, he caught a bit of a breeze and soared up into the tree, to the nest his mama had provided \u2014 safe and secure once more, ready to soar again \u2026 when the time was right.\nWhen I think of that mama and those rescuers, I think of the family of God \u2014 the rescuers, God\u2019s very own. For, like that baby bird, one minute in life, we\u2019re sitting pretty and then something knocks us out of the nest. We bat our wings and still we plummet to the earth. Sometimes, we are shaken from security by the loss of someone dear that lays a weight of grief upon us, or we feel a frailty of body and spirit, where once there was powerful strength. Sometimes the cruelty of this world knocks us down until we find ourselves on the ground with the predators closing in. We feel utterly and totally alone.\nBut, it does not end there, my friends! For we are never alone \u2014 ever. There is a God who never leaves us, never forsakes us, fights for us, standing in the gap to be our rescuer, no matter where, no matter when, no matter what. Oft times it is His family, who come a running, stirring up a mighty ruckus, running off the predators, until we regain our strength and, with a bit of nudging and a whole lot of prayer, get us to that place of safety where we can remember, once again, how to spread forth our wings of faith and soar. And if, perchance we had never spread them before, this time \u2014 at the end of this trial, we are able to do exceedingly and abundantly more than we could ever imagine before. We soar with wings"}

Then, relations cooled again in 2008 and 2009.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, a series of new episcopal appointments with the twofold approval followed Benedict\u2019s invitation to then-Chinese president Hu Jintao for a meeting to be held in the Vatican in 2009.\nThe meeting with the Pope could not be held, but the invitation was appreciated.\nFrom 2011 on, there was an interchange of appointments with twofold approval, and appointments by the Chinese government, and the freeze in relationship culminated last year with a case in the Shanghai diocese, one of the biggest and most important in China.\nFr.

Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, a team of anthropological researchers from the University of South Florida on Wednesday was awarded a more-than-$420,000 research grant by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThe team, led by Drs. Erin Kimmerle and Christian Wells, has been working nonstop to provide answers for the families of boys who were sent to Dozier during its 111-year history. They will be exhuming remains from the school grounds and will attempt to link identities to the remains through DNA testing.\nThe $423,528 grant will help the team perform DNA testing and conduct forensic anthropological examinations of human remains for identification, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) announced Wednesday. The University of North Texas Center for Human Identification has stepped forward to perform all of the DNA analyses, compare the samples and enter the data into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs).\nThe NIJ offers an incredible program for cold cases and identification of missing persons.This funding is critical for completing the next steps in our research at the Dozier School for Boys including excavating human remains and performing a full anthropological analysis on them, said Dr. Kimmerle.\nAccording to a USF press release, the new grant was awarded through NIJs 2013 competitive funding solicitation, Using DNA Technology to Identify the Missing. Newer DNA technologies have become available in recent years partly because of NIJ-funded research and development, which has helped crime laboratories to successfully analyze aged, degraded and compromised biological evidence.\nThe grant comes after several setbacks in the course of the research team's efforts to exhume bodies at the school. Earlier this summer, Secretary of State Ken Detzner rejected the researchers' request for a permit to exhume bodies, saying his department did not have the authority to grant such a request.The Florida Cabinet, however, bypassed Detzner's rejection and overwhelmingly green-lighted the exhumation process in a meeting earlier this month.\nThe Dozier site contains a cemetery with 31 metal crosses, but the USF researchers have identified at least 19 additional grave shafts in several wooded areas outside the marked cemetery and believe there may be more than 50 unmarked graves at the school. The team has already been able to confirm the deaths of 96 children who were sent to the school between 1914 and 1973.\nThe school has come under fire in recent years for possible abuse, both physical and sexual, and possible murder at the school, which housed numerous amounts of boys from 1900 to 2011."}

A name change followed -- it was dubbed Odeum Colorado last fall.

Fox wanted to be paid $1 per cable subscriber each month for the broadcast signal it had once given away freely from the stations it owns.

John Kerry, D-Mass., raised concerns about the effectiveness of a 1992 cable law that allows broadcasters to seek compensation from cable and satellite operators for their signals.\n\"I will reach out to both parties, the FCC, and consumer advocates to assess lessons learned from this dispute and what, if any, changes to law are necessary,\" Kerry said in a statement.\nFox said it could no longer give away its stations&apos; signals to cable companies because the network is facing stiff competition from cable channels, such as the Walt Disney Co.&apos;s ESPN, which earn subscriber fees on top of advertising dollars.\nTime Warner Cable, in the meantime, had vowed to hold the line on cable bill increases, and said the vast of majority of viewers who went to its Web site, www.rolloverorgettough.com, urged it to \"get tough\" and fight back against higher costs.\nNeither side would have fared well if signals had been pulled.\nFox would have lost viewers and advertising dollars for some highly anticipated shows this month, including the 20th anniversary special of \"The Simpsons\" on Jan. 10, and the season premieres of"}

Palestinian terrorists have ripped Israeli families apart with their barbaric violence, while innocent Palestinians have been caught in the crossfire and their livelihood destroyed by the conflict.\nWe now have a tremendous opportunity to embrace positive change, with the hope of ushering in a new and promising era for all the peoples of the region. The \"road map\" is an important tool towards achieving this goal.\nLast week the Israeli Government accepted this road map, so the onus is now on the new Palestinian leadership. It must prove that it is serious about ending the violence and terrorism, and ready to lay the foundations for genuine peace and reconciliation.\nWe must be wary of shortcuts. Although the highly touted Palestinian declaration of a \"ceasefire\" would be a start, it will not be sufficient to sustain peace-making.\nThe terrorist organisations will simply exploit this interlude to consolidate their strength to carry out even bloodier attacks. For this reason, the road map stresses that the Palestinians have to \"undertake an unconditional cessation of violence\", including a serious, concerted war against terrorism.\nIsrael has no desire to control the lives of the Palestinian population - it is not good for us, and it is certainly not good for them. The people of Israel yearn to reach a genuine lasting peace with their Palestinian neighbours, and are ready to make territorial concessions to achieve this goal. Israel has already expressed its readiness to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state and to make compromises for peace. We hope that the Palestinian side will show the same spirit of goodwill and conciliation. Regrettably, the continued Palestinian demand that Israel accept the \"right\" of descendants of Palestinian refugees to \"return\" to settle within Israeli territory is hardly a sign of peace and goodwill. On the contrary, such a demand is tantamount to a call for the demographic destruction of the State of Israel.\nThe success of the road map is dependent upon whether the Palestinian leadership is ready to turn over a new leaf, and finally renounce terrorism and recognise the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. If the Palestinians do so, they will find that Israel is ready to march together with them towards a new dawn of peace and reconciliation.\nSilvan Shalom is the Israeli Foreign Minister."}

As stated in the First Convocation Booklet and Ceremonial Inauguration of the Building Scheme at Gangodawila, 1960, I t was founded with \"thirteen men of wisdom\" including the eminent oriental scholar, the Most Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thero, at a time in history when the nation needed to recognize and value the knowledge of Buddhism and oriental culture. The strong need to promote and revive Buddhism and the richness of the oriental knowledge and culture was aptly understood and acknowledged by the scholars who rallied round Most Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thero. Vidyodaya Pirivena was established with the noble notion of reviving the glory of the cultural traditions and knowledge, which was over-shadowed by Western imperialism. On a par with oriental systems of education, the Vidyodaya Pirivena fostered the belief that knowledge should be created, gained and disseminated, not for its sake but for a cause, thus, knowledge is only a means to an end and not an end in itself.\nRecognizing the significance of the contribution of the Vidyodaya Pirivena to the nation in moulding its character and guiding its direction, after eighty six years, it was granted University status by the then government of Sri Lanka. The proposal to do so was presented to the parliament by Wijayananda Dahanayake, then Minister of Education in 1956. On 18th February 1959, the Vidyodaya University was inaugurated in an impressive formal ceremony at the Independence Square and on the same day, the academic activities were also initiated at the Sumangala Hall of the Vidyodaya Pirivena in Maligakanda. The establishment of the University was seen as a \"significant landmark in the march of the nation to progress\" by Sir Oliver Goonatilleke. The first Chancellor of the Vidyodaya University, Most Venerable Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thero was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor. His knowledge, unmatched intellectuality, dedication, broad vision on higher education and ideological stance transcended the limitations of religion, culture and ethnicity and rightfully transformed the Vidyodaya Pirivena into Vidyodaya University of Sri Lanka. The conferment of Vidyodaya Pirivena into Vidyodaya University of Sri Lanka was an expression of recognition of the great services rendered to the nation by the Pirivena and an expectation to widen its horizons to embrace the larger needs of the nation. Most importantly, it was seen as a dire need of the masses - a University with its roots in the traditional oriental culture of the mass for the masses. The establishment of the University coinc"}

Over time things change. I started playing with another group and got away from these golfing buddies. This seemed like a perfect time to renew old acquaintances.\nSo I threw my clubs into the van and set sail Thursday morning for Mount Vernon. I would be meeting up with my \u201cold\u201d group of friends. Mostly former teachers from Lakota High School, these guys play a scramble format. We choose teams that appear to be fair and wait for the competition to begin. Of course we have to endure the complaints of one team being \u201cloaded,\u201d but the scores suggest that the teams are always competitive.\nWe played Apple Valley Golf Club Thursday and I had forgotten how beautiful the course is. My favorite hole is the par 3 fifth. A scenic little hole, it requires a short shot over a lake that usually has a swan gracefully plying the water though it was not to be seen this year.\nMy team acted like we knew what we were doing as we shot a 7 under par 29 on the front nine. That score included a great par save on the aforementioned fifth hole. When you have to chip back towards the water from above the hole, getting a par is not easy.\nApparently we must have felt that score was good enough as we went even par on the back nine. That proves again that golf is a fickle game. As it turned out, seven under was enough as our opponents could only muster a five under total.\nAfter golf we headed into Mount Vernon to stay at the Super 8 Motel. It was hot on the golf course and a cool dip in their indoor pool sounded great. Cool water, however, was not what awaited us! Icy cold was more like it, so if anyone connected to the Super 8 reads this, you might want to warm the waters up for our next trip.\nWe can walk to a steakhouse called Jake\u2019s from the motel and we always get good food and service there. We also rehash the day\u2019s golf results and a lot of good natured ribbing ensues.\nOn Friday we head to Chapel Hill Golf Course and after mixing up the teams go back at it. We managed to get 17 holes in before threatening weather ended our trip prematurely. Interestingly enough, the scores were again 5 and 7 under par. If you have seen 18 at Chapel Hill, the scores were not likely to go any lower!\nThe trip was fun, but something \u2014 or more to the point, someone \u2014 was missing. Dave Worstein was a regular on this and many other golf trips. A couple of weeks ago Dave lost a courageous battle with cancer, and to suggest he was missed on this trip would be a huge understatement.\nYou can say that Dave Worstein was a fun loving man. It would also be appropriate to say he was a \u201cpot stirrer\u201d as he loved to needle his friends. In fact when each golf season started Dave would say something nice to one of us. When we looked at him curiously, he would smile and say he was turning over a new leaf.\nWithin minutes he would be pranking someone. He was never going to change!\nOn the golf course you could expect two things from Dave: On the first tee, he would tee his ball up in front of the tee markers. He did it without fail just to see if anyone would notice. On this trip we all did it as a tribute to Dave.\nThe other thing he would do involved what he called the \u201cWorstein\u201d rule. In"}

News of the tsunami reached Weinstein, and soon after, he received an email from Harvard seismologists, upgrading the earthquake\u2019s magnitude again to an 8.9.

But in last seven minutes something extraordinary happens. His passes suddenly find their targets; he is able to run for first downs by the scantest of margins. He will take time off the clock on drives that inch down the field before finally scoring go-ahead touchdowns.\nBut it\u2019s not just Tebow. The Broncos defense has upped its game since he began his starting streak, holding opponents at bay and keeping scores close so the Broncos still have a fighting chance at the end of games. His offensive line gels in what folks are now calling \u201cTebow time\u201d as well.\nAnd then there is the opposition, which seems to be in on the act as well. Three weeks ago a Christian, Minnesota quarterback Christian Ponder, threw a last-minute interception that gave Denver the ball and allowed Tebow to take the team in for the winning score. Last week it was Marion Barber, the Chicago Bears running back. who inexplicably ran out of bounds to stop the clock, giving the Broncos just enough time to eke out a tying field goal. Then in overtime, on a play that could be characterized as a \u201chand of God\u201d event, Barber had the ball stripped out of his hands and the Broncos kicked a game winner.\nFinally, and perhaps the most impressive and miraculous element of this entire story, has been the performance of Broncos kicker Matt Prater. No one has ever heard of this guy before and suddenly he has become the key component of the most incredible story in sports. Last week he sent the game into overtime with a 59-yard field goal. Then he won it with a 51-yard field goal. Earlier he beat Miami in overtime with a 52-yarder. This stuff just doesn\u2019t happen, folks.\nLike I said, something odd is at work her.

Scientists have been divided for over a century over what actually caused the impact, arguing between comet, asteroid and meteor.\nIt has even infiltrated popular culture - in 2008, Nintendo brought out a Wii game based on the Tunguska event and in 1996 it received one of the true accolades of mysterious happenings - inspiring an episode of the X-Files."}

They've also said that January's collections could provide a clearer picture the state's situation.\n\"One month does not make a recession,\" said Ernie Goss, a Creighton University economics professor who tracks the Midwestern economy. \"Certainly if you see a downturn, though, you can't say that looks great. There is some reason for concern.\"\nAs a result, some lawmakers, already figuring on a lean year because of previous spending commitments, see the need for additional belt tightening this session, even as Gov. Kathleen Sebelius prepares to unveil her proposed budget Tuesday.\n\"This year, with the way the budget profile looks, it's also a year we're going to have to ask the tough questions,\" House Speaker Melvin Neufeld, R-Ingalls, said as his chamber's GOP announced its legislative agenda Friday.\nHouse Republicans suggested that they want to hold the state's budget increase down to 5 percent compared to last year's increase of 8.1 percent.\nRep. Sharon Schwartz, R-Washington, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers have previously approved commitments that will push the state's $6 billion general fund budget up 4.2 percent this year.\nAn economic downtown earlier this decade helped plunge the state into a fiscal crisis in 2002. However, since that time, the state's economy has recovered and generally hummed along, allowing lawmakers to approve large increases in public school funding without raising taxes.\nBut December's numbers left the state with the biggest shortfall it's seen in tax collections over the last 24 months, said Alan Conroy, director of the state Legislative Research Department.\nHowever, the state's revenue picture can be affected by non-economic factors, such as the timing of the processing and collections of taxes, he said. Next month's totals could include tax receipts from Christmas sales and individual paying their income taxes due in that month.\nState budget forecasters predicted in November that the state economy would grow by about 5 percent in fiscal year 2008, slower than the 6.1 percent and 5.4 percent gains figured for 2006 and 2007. However, the group is scheduled to meet again in April to reassess their estimates of the state's economy and budget profile.\nAlthough it's unclear at this point what the state's immediate economic future looks like, Goss said Kansas may still be better positioned to weather a recession than many other states.\nUnlike states who recently had red-hot real-estate markets, Goss said Kansas"}

Wanted to listen to it while walking around, but forgot your transistor radio? The Pioneer inno, as well as the nearly identical Samsung Helix, is XM Satellite\u2019s $400 answer to this pressing humanitarian need, giving the user the ability to listen to live satellite radio while walking around, and in a pretty stylish way, too.\nThe inno\u2019s dimensions are comparable to a full-size iPod, except that the front edges are beveled slightly, and the bottom rounded. The body is made of a metallic bluish-gray facade, with a small stubby antenna protruding out the top. Taking a cue from the Motorola Razr, the buttons on the face are all outlined with bright blue lights.\nThe inno comes packaged with goodies, including a cradle to recharge the unit, a 20-foot antenna, a remote control, uncomfortable headphones that also double as an antenna, and a pair of ear buds that, while snug in the ear canal, sound muddy. (Not helping this is the fact that, unlike the iPod with its myriad audio profiles, you can only adjust the treble and bass levels.) The device plugs into the cradle on its side, which seems a little awkward, even if the crisp screen automatically reorients images 90 degrees when plugged in. The cradle also comes with a line out jack for connecting the unit to a home stereo, but it\u2019s almost redundant considering the power of the unit\u2019s FM transmitter. Aside from the fact that you have your pick of the spectrum to stream the device, it also comes in clearly even when the stereo is a good 15 feet away. Annoyingly, though, the same transmitter that works so well in the home is next to useless when trying to stream it to your car stereo.\nOutside the office, reception was remarkably clear, with only a few dropouts even in the cavernous avenues of New York; In fact, walking from Penn Station to Grand Central, I got better reception than the FM radio for my iPod. One of the nice things, especially when listening to aforementioned baseball games, is that the screen displays and continually updates the score, inning, and number of outs. While that\u2019s no so demanding for, say, a pitcher\u2019s duel, it\u2019s quite helpful when you\u2019re dealing with a slugfest and rambling announcers."}

Information about storage was not included in the report.\nThe least-expensive iPhone is said to resemble the iPhone X and include FaceID though Apple might concede the dual-camera option to the higher price models. The analyst expects this $700 option to account for 55% of new iPhone sales and increase through 2019.\nIf the part about the colors is correct, Apple is set introduce a slash of color to the monochrome phone market. Currently, phones are mostly available in greys and blacks with most vendors offering a couple of color options through special editions. That\u2019s boring.

{"idx": "14928", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: If you\u2019re looking for a new monitor, you may be bewildered by today\u2019s options. The last five years have seen the average monitor\u2019s feature list swell to include better panels, higher resolutions, and more inputs. But figuring out whether you actually need all of those features, especially if you\u2019re not a gamer, can be rather difficult.\nAlongside improved resolutions like 4K, one of the big selling points of many modern monitors is a high refresh rate. Often you\u2019ll see displays marketed as having a 120Hz or 144Hz panel. This is among the most confusing traits for consumers, because the name doesn\u2019t provide much explanation, and unlike most improvements, refresh rates don\u2019t enhance color accuracy or resolution.\nIs it better just because the numbers are higher? Do you need a 120Hz or 240Hz monitor?\nIf you just want to jump ahead and buy one now, here are some of our favorite high-end displays.\nWhat does Hz actually mean?\nPeople often assume that \u201c120Hz\u201d has something do with performance because it seems similar to the way processor clock speeds are described. In fact, the term describes something a bit different. Refresh rate.\nRefresh rate is the number of times per second a display refreshes its image. Since movement is displayed by the difference between frames, the refresh rate effectively places a hard cap on the frame rate that\u2019s visible. That said, refresh rate is not the same as frame rate. Refresh rate is an attribute of the monitor, while frame rate is an attribute of the information being sent to it.\nIf you can run a game at 100 frames per second, you may see a tangible benefit from playing it on a monitor that can refresh that many times per second. But if you\u2019re watching a movie at a classic 24 FPS (frames per second), a higher refresh rate monitor won\u2019t make any difference.\nIf your computer can play a game at a high enough frame rate to match a 120Hz or 240Hz monitor, you\u2019ll see a noticeable change in the perceived sharpness of a moving image. Blurring occurs because of how the human brain processes the set of individual frames a monitor displays. The brain blurs together the series of frames to create a sensible moving picture, but some detail is lost along the way.\nA higher refresh rate helps to decrease the blur by giving our brains more information to act on, in turn reducing perceived blur. However, unlike computer hardware, our brains aren\u2019t all made to the same specification. Some people notice the difference between a 60Hz and 120Hz display immediately, while others can\u2019t see what everyone is all worked up about. The difference between 120Hz and 240Hz is even more subtle.\nAgain, it is very much dependent on what you\u2019re doing on your system. Gamers will notice sharper visuals during fast action, and moving a mouse can feel smoother compared to a more typical 60Hz display. Web browsing when fast scrolling down a page can look a little smoother, too, but in watching online videos and answering emails, you won\u2019t see any advantage.\nBecause refresh rates and frame rates are very different things, they can often mismatch. That\u2019s when something called screen tearing can occur. It tends to happen when a computer\u2019s video card is spitting out frames at a rate well beyond the refresh rate of the monitor connected to it. Because more frames are being rendered than the monitor can handle, half-frames are sometimes shown together on the screen, manifesting as an obvious split between two portions of"}

It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy.\nThe Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market. They\u2019re all great chips in their own way, but some certainly offer more value than others and for many, the most powerful chips will be complete overkill.\nBefore upgrading though, you may want to consider that AMD announced its next-generation Ryzen 3000 CPUs at CES 2019. They are set to launch in mid-2019; Individuals looking for superior power on desktops and longer battery life on notebooks might want to hold out until they are available.\nIf you do want to buy a Ryzen-based system or CPU now though, we\u2019ve broken down the chips into their respective segments and made our recommendation for the best chip in each to help you decide which is right for you. As with every hardware recommendation though, make sure to apply our suggestions to your own personal situation before making your decision.\nAlternatively, check out our list of the best AMD CPUs you can buy right now.\nAMD has always offered great value for money at the lower end of the CPU spectrum and that old adage is just as true with its Ryzen CPUs. AMD offered a wide range of budget-conscious chips with its first Ryzen CPUs, including great standouts like the Ryzen 3 1200 and Ryzen 3 1300X. When we paired them up with an MSI Gaming X RX 580 and the beefy Zotac GTX 1080 Ti AMP! Edition, we found them to be very capable.\nThe 3DMark synthetic results delivered what we would expect: better CPUs provided higher scores.\nBut in gaming tests, the 1200 and 1300X showed themselves able to deliver solid frame rates that were in many cases, pretty close to much more expensive Ryzen CPUs.\nThese chips are still available in some places, but they have now largely been replaced by AMD\u2019s second-generation Ryzen CPUs. However, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 3 chips in the Zen+ generation are actually accelerated processing units (APU), which means they come with an onboard graphics processor as Intel CPUs do. The Ryzen 3 2200G offers Ryzen 3 1200-like performance and its GPU can offer much better entry-level gaming than a comparable Intel chip. Considering the 2200G can be had for under $100, it makes for a perfect entry-level gaming chip and its four cores mean it\u2019s great for basic multitasking and work too.\nIf you have a graphics card in mind or plan to overclock, you could opt for the 1300X. It\u2019s a little more powerful at stock speeds thanks to its 8MB of L3 cache and an overclock would give increase its performance lead, but it is more expensive at around $130.\nThis price bracket is where AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs really shine, offering amazing multi"}

Trump\u2019s supporters latched onto catchphrases, such as \u201clock her up\u201d and \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d which can be incredibly influential in a political period full of short Twitter statements and quick media appearances. This is why Democrats do themselves no favors when they embrace conservative terminology instead of reframing the issues.\nThe \u201calt-right\u201d has grabbed onto other hateful ideologies, as well. Although individuals within the movement may vary on their viewpoints, overall they \u201cregard Jews as dangerous outsiders who bear major responsibility for the decline of European civilization\u201d and believe \u201cwomen need and want men to rule over them and should be stripped of any political role,\u201d according to Political Research Associates.\n\u201cAlt-right\u201d supporters have famously welcomed Trump\u2019s presidency with Nazi salutes and chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d at a rally to save a Confederate statute. If these people are so clearly supporting racist and anti-Semitic views, why do we not just call them white supremacists and neo-Nazis?\nInstead of these clearly defined labels, \u201calt-right\u201d is ambiguous, especially to people unfamiliar with the movement. The term itself almost sounds cool and edgy, not immediately threatening and hateful. \u201cAlt-right\u201d likely came about as an attempt to rebrand the racist movement and step away from widely condemned ideologies, such as neo-Nazism and white supremacy.\nThe Associated Press even released guidelines for reporters writing about the \u201calt-right,\u201d urging them to steer clear of the term without proper context.\nEvery time Democrats use the term \u201calt-right\u201d they are normalizing it and allowing the fringe movement to frame the issue. Responding to a rally where attendees chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d by labeling the crowd as neo-Nazis is much more succinct and digestible than explaining the history and beliefs of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement.\nThe power of political terminology can be seen in immigration in the United States, as well. For years, the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d had been used for people entering the country illegally. Although just two words, the phrase immediately gives you an impression of the people it\u2019s describing \u2014 that \u201cillegal aliens\u201d are criminals and are unlike the rest of us. Democrats finally pushed back on this narrative by using the phrase \u201cundocumented immigrants,\u201d which frames the issue with a more sympathetic lens.\nWith the 2020 election gearing up, Democrats should take the opportunity to control the narrative instead of falling into old Republican traps.\nYes. There are many out there who are blind to the racist sentiments over the Democratic party. Just ask Nika Elugar of Boston.\nMike Kelly, if you don't realize that what you wrote was total BS and not even close to truth given that the biggest racists were Democrats, just ask LBJ, just look at history and see which party was the champion of civil rights, yes Republicans.

And no, I'm not kidding. It's..weird.\nWe've seen a lot of unique promotional videos over the years, but the above definitely belongs somewhere near the top of the list in the \"Say what?\" category. Using ASMR to promote Darksiders III isn't quite as random as it may first seem, as the video description explains the team at THQ Nordic wanted to give folks a way to \"de-stress this holiday season.\" It's also kind of funny since, you know, it's Fury doing the ASMR and she's anything but \"chill.\"\nFor this video, THQ partnered with body paint artist Ruby True. She's decked out like Fury from Darksiders III and even her face is painted so that it looks like the game character. If nothing else, you've got to appreciate the fact that, to get the eyes right, she has to keep them closed. That means she's doing all of this ASMR business while not being able to see what she's doing. Also, she's wearing costume gauntlets that have got to be making it tricky to feel exactly what's going on.\nIt's kind of spooky, if I'm being honest, but the ASMR stuff seems to be on point. If you close your eyes and pop on some headphones, maybe you'll find the subtle sounds of flames gliding past and a wood wick candle soothing.\nThe team has five of these videos planned and, so far, only two have been posted. You can find the second video on YouTube, featuring Fury with a bunch of chains and what appears to be a leather replica of the whip she uses in the game. Again, if you haven't dabbled in ASMR yet, it's understandable that all of that would sound a bit strange. But everything here is super subtle, with the chains gently clinking as the bend of leather blends into the background. I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it.\nWhile THQ Nordic is the publisher, Darksiders III is being developed by Gunfire Games. The series has been dormant for quite some time, with studio closures and license deals finally leading to this continuation. Darksiders is low key one of my favorite series of all time, so here's hoping that Fury's adventure is just as much fun as War and Death before her.\nFury's quest takes place alongside those of her brothers, with the adventure set on earth following an unplanned start to the end of days. Her specific mission is to take out the Seven Deadly Sins, which are big monsters that embody their namesakes.\nThe good news is that Gunfire Games is largely made up from members of Vigil, the now disbanded studio responsible for the first two games.

Google made its name and still generates most of its revenue from search and contextual text ads.\nDoubleClick, which was founded in 1996, provides display ads on Web sites like MySpace, The Wall Street Journal and America Online as well as software to help those sites maximize ad revenue. The company also helps ad buyers \u2014 advertisers and ad agencies \u2014 manage and measure the effectiveness of their rich media, search and other online ads.\nDoubleClick has also recently introduced a Nasdaq-like exchange for online ads that analysts say could be lucrative for Google.\nThe sale brings to an end weeks of a bidding battle between Microsoft and Google. Microsoft has been trying to catch Google in the online advertising business, and the loss of DoubleClick would be a a major setback.\n\u201cKeeping Microsoft away from DoubleClick is worth billions to Google,\u201d an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, Jordan Rohan, said.\nAcquiring DoubleClick expands Google\u2019s business far beyond algorithm-driven ad auctions into a relationship-based business with Web publishers and advertisers. Google has been expanding its AdSense network into video and display ads online and is selling ads to a limited degree on television, newspapers and radio.\nThe sale also raises questions about how Google will manage its existing business and that of the new DoubleClick unit while avoiding conflicts of interest. If DoubleClick\u2019s existing clients start to feel that Google is using DoubleClick\u2019s relationships to further its own ad network, some Web publishers or advertisers might jump ship.\nA highflying stock in the late 1990s, DoubleClick was an early pioneer in online advertising and was one of the few online ad companies to survive the burst of the dot.com bubble. In 2005, DoubleClick was taken private by two private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. Since then, the company has sold two data and e-mail advertising businesses and acquired Klipmart, which specializes in online video.\nThe company generated about $300 million in revenue last year, mostly from providings ads on Web sites.\nDoubleClick\u2019s chief executive, David Rosenblatt, said a few weeks ago that a new system it had developed for the buying and selling of online ads would probably become the chief money maker within five years. The system, a Nasdaq-like exchange for online ads, brings Web publishers and advertising buyers together on a Web site where they can participate in auctions for ad space.\nDoubleClick\u2019s exchange is different from the ad auctions that Google uses on its networks because the exchange is open to any Web publisher or ad network \u2014 not just the sites in Google\u2019s network. Offline ad sales have been handled through negotiation, but the efficiency of online auction systems has caused some advertising executives to consider using auctions for offline ads in places like television and newspapers.

Golf courses and resorts abound throughout the state in a wide variety of terrain, from the beaches of the southern coast to the Blue Ridge and Cumberland Mountains in the north. Georgia's generally warm climate guarantees good golfing conditions during at least 10 months of the year.\nBrasstown Valley Resort and Spa offers golf in the cooler climes of the North Georgia mountains, between Chattahoochee National Forest and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Named one of Golf Digest's top places to play, the Brasstown golf course takes players through wildlife preserves and over ponds and streams. Framed by the mountains, the course has four sets of tees at each hole and is suitable for all skill levels of players. After golfing, visitors can take advantage of activities like rafting, kayaking, canoeing and lake tours. The lodge's accommodations feature gas fireplaces, balconies and views of either the mountains or the valley. The secluded cottages, set back in the forested mountains, have a wood fireplace, fully equipped kitchen and covered deck with outdoor gas grill. Guests have access to wireless Internet, outdoor and indoor pools, a fitness center, a spa and tennis.\nSea Island, a resort located two hours south of Savannah, has two nationally rated championship golf courses and a golf learning center. The Seaside Course sits on the southern tip of St. Simons Island. Truly an oceanside course with a demanding layout, it has hosted a number of US Golf Association events. The Plantation Course takes players through marsh and forest and also showcases the ocean. It may not be as challenging as Seaside, but its tidal creeks and lakes can pose an element of danger. Visitors can stay at The Cloister at Sea Island; The Lodge at Sea Island Golf Club; or the Sea Island Cottages. Rooms at the lodge have views of the ocean, St. Simons Island or the golf course; 24-hour butler service; and complimentary town bicycles. Priding itself on using fresh ingredients from local farmers, Sea Island provides dining options ranging from fine dining in the Georgian Room to a more relaxed atmosphere at the River Bar, Oak Room or Beach Club.

The patent was issued in May 2004.\nBiswajit Das, director of the Nevada Nanotechnology Center at UNLV, has applied for four patents, including one for a device that stores digital data on silicon nanocrystals, which could lead to lighter computers.\nBiswajit \u201cBJ\u201d Das is a scientist with big ideas about small things \u2014 things so tiny they are measured by the nanometer, a unit of length about one-one hundred thousandth the width of a human hair.\nFor instance, Das\u2019 lab at UNLV has filed an application to patent a device that stores digital data on silicon nanocrystals, which could give rise to computers that are lighter and more compact.\nNano-things will change the world in giant ways, Das thinks. Inventions arising from research at UNLV also could help transform the character and economy of Southern Nevada.\nDas and other business-minded professors want to turn their innovations into marketable goods, spurring fledgling industries, creating jobs and encouraging still more research at the university.\nIn past years, however, researchers at UNLV made discoveries, published papers on them, accepted plaudits from colleagues and moved on to new projects. Few bothered to work with local companies to commercialize their ideas.\nAs a result, the university lags behind its peers in the West when it comes to claiming inventions.

I believe he is wrong.\nIn the Iran-US wrangling over the past three decades, Tehran has repeatedly delivered on its promises, while the US has fallen short. In the late 1980s, President George HW Bush askedIran to help with the release of Western hostages in Lebanon, vowing \u201cgoodwill for goodwill\u201d. Iran facilitated the release; in return, the US increased pressure on Iran.\nIn 2001, when the US asked for Iran\u2019s support in its \"war on terror\" in Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps gave crucial intelligence to the US military. Tehran also played a constructive role in Afghanistan by throwing its full support behind the US-backed president, Hamid Karzai - but President George W Bush responded by putting it on the \"axis of evil\".\nAccording to Ryan Crocker, the former US ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, Iranian diplomats were \"pragmatic and focused\" when it came to assisting in Afghanistan, at one point even producing \u201can extremely valuable map showing the Taliban\u2019s order of battle just before American military action began\u201d.\nThat all ended after the infamous \"axis of evil\" speech, as the Iranian leadership \u201cconcluded that in spite of their cooperation with the American war effort, the United States remained implacably hostile to the Islamic Republic\u201d.\nIran also delivered on its promises in the 2015 nuclear deal. The International Atomic Energy agency repeatedly confirmed that Iran was upholding its end of the bargain - but not only did the US withdraw from the deal, it has also since engaged in a maximum pressure policy, aiming to force Iran to capitulate to its demands.\nIn his recent statement, Trump launched straight into an attack on Iran as the root of all evil, rather than immediately addressing what was meant to be the subject at hand, namely Saudi Arabia and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump should also know that 15 of the 19 hijackers who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks on the United States were Saudis. There was not even one Iranian among them.\nIn each of the important episodes outlined above, Iran respected the rules of the game, while the US reneged on its promises. It is also important to recall that Iran's engagements throughout the region predated the nuclear deal. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Iran intervened in Iraq only after a number of US officials openly called for an American invasion of Iran to follow that of Iraq.\nIn Syria, Iran's involvement has not happened in a vacuum, either.\nOn Saudi Arabia, Friedman argues that Trump vowed to advance US interests in the region by selling $110bn in arms to Saudi Arabia and betting on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - but bin Salman \"used his carte blanche\" to project power and stretch far beyond his capabilities by intervening in Yemen, blockading Qatar, abducting the prime minister of Lebanon, cracking down on female activists and \"permitting, if not ordering, his team to murder moderate Saudi democracy advocate Jamal Khashoggi\".\nFried"}

The letter alleged that Finance Board member Michael Evangelisti had called the state Department of Transportation to say that work on Maple Avenue was being done without proper inspection, with improper paving procedures and was contracted without proper bidding.\nCronin's letter also said he had found \"no basis\" for such claims.\nEvangelisti, at the Finance Board meeting, denied that he had passed on allegations to the DOT, saying only that he had called to get information after \"residents called me\" with concerns about the project.\nAfter about two weeks on the job, in November, the contractor, American Industries of Jewett City, ceased work. It was rumored that cessation was ordered by the state because of irregularities. The state is paying 80 percent of the cost and the town 20 percent, or about $70,000.\nMaple Avenue, a part of state Route 154, is a main north-south town artery.\nThe improvement project includes leveling the road, spot repairs, an overlay of asphalt and drainage work.\nRegarding bidding for the job, Town Engineer Michael Ott said at the selectmen's meeting that American was selected as the lowest of four bidders and that the contract process was reviewed and approved by the DOT.\nJoe Dillon, an engineer with Nathan Jacobsen Associates and the town's overseer for the project, said he was \"on site full-time during any construction activities\" to ensure the work \"followed state highway specifications.\"\nLarry Bonin, town public works director, said road crews also raised catch basins to ensure proper drainage, a task separate from the state-funded project.\nAs to why the work was stopped, Ott said that \"in accordance with DOT procedures\" that decision was made when it became too cold for a lasting application of asphalt. The possibility of a weather-related halt was \"provided for in contract documents,\" he said.\nPaul Sweet, project manager for American Industries, said the decision was proper because \"we don't want a job we have to come back and redo.\" As to job oversight by town representatives, he said, \"they were there when we were there.\"\nSweet said it will take \"eight good days of good, decent weather\" to finish the work, and that asphalt application usually resumes around mid-April.\nPace said of the public report on the project that his \"intent is to just get the clear and true facts\" to residents rather than \"information from second and third parties.\""}

On the other hand, the much-awaited expansion of the Punjab Cabinet will be made in the coming days, as the Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif has formally asked its coalition partner PPP to recommend prospective names of MPAs for the Ministerial slots. However, Parliamentary Secretary Law and Parliamentary Affairs will be appointed later on. This was told to the media by Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan Khosa, senior adviser to Chief Minister Punjab, while addressing a joint Press conference with PPP Senior Minister and Parliamentary Leader at the Punjab Assembly Raja Riaz Ahmed here at CM Secretariat on Friday. Punjab Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rana Sanaullah was also present at the Press conference. It proved to be a show aiming at dispelling the impression that the coalition govt in the Punjab was heading towards a break-up following the recent spate of statements from both sides of the political divide. While further substantiating the assertion that there existed no threat to the provincial coalition govt, and settling of the longstanding and contentious issue of the expansion of the provincial cabinet, Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khan told the media that more members, from both the PML-N and the PPP, would be included soon, as Shahbaz Sharif had already asked the PPP leadership for recommending names to be appointed as Ministers in the provincial Cabinet. In his talk, Raja Riaz confirmed that list of PPP members had been sought, and would soon be provided to the provincial govt with the approval of the PPP's central leadership. 'We will hand over the PPP nominees for the Punjab cabinet soon after the consultation with the Party leadership', he responded to a query. Sardar Khosa said the govt had appointed 34 Parliamentary Secretaries as per power-sharing formula. 'The coalition govt will stay intact, and there is no threat to the present provincial set-up. In case, whenever a dissension arises between the coalition partners, six-member committee - three from each side - meets to settle the issues', he said.

This poses a challenge when installing tiles directly over top of it. The linseed oil in the linoleum can cause breakdown of the adhesive that holds the tiles to the floor.

Ever since Jon Favreau's Iron Man hit screens in 2008, the studio has made it a habit of using end-credits scenes in their films - something Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige wanted to emulate from Ferris Bueller's Day Off - so that audiences would stay and see who made the movies, while also allotting them time to tease future movies.\nOf course, while some mid-credits and post-credits scenes tease future MCU installments and story arcs, others are merely fun codas for comic book and MCU fans to enjoy; that's the benefit of having multiple end-credits scenes in one film. Regardless, with a decade and more than a dozen movies under their belt, there are a lot of credits scenes for audiences to remember, which can understandably be quite tough, even for the more die-hard fans out there. So, we've decided to help out with that predicament ahead of the release of Avengers: Infinity War.\nThe Iron Man post-credits scene was the one that started it all. It didn't just set a precedent for all other MCU movies to include end-credits scenes but also potentially set up future installments. To non-comic book fans, the scene could come off as unexciting - especially at the time - but those who knew what was happening could only dream of all the possibilities.\nAfter defeating Iron Monger, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) heads to his living room and sees a mysterious man standing in the dark, who turns around and introduces himself as the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). He's there to discuss the Avenger Initiative with Tony, thus teasing the future team-up of the Marvel superhero team, the Avengers.\nIt's still one of the best end-credits scenes Marvel has ever released because of its simplicity and its effectiveness in teasing the future of an entire cinematic franchise. Needless to say, it got comic book fans excited for more Marvel Studios-made movies. Remember, Iron Man was the first film they ever made as an independent studio.\nWhile Iron Man was Marvel Studios' first movie, audiences didn't have to wait long to see the studio's follow-up project. The Incredible Hulk released just a month later and had Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark show up at the end of the film, speaking to General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) in a bar. Tony tells the General that they are putting together a team, at which point Ross asks, \"Who's we?\"\nOf course, \"we\" was meant to be S.H.I.E.L.D., while the team was referring to the Avengers. Sure, Iron Man's scene was exciting, but this was the icing on the cake. It was truly the beginning of the Avengers, and it showed Marvel's original plan for the team before Joss Whedon came on board. Tony was already part of the team and it looked like he was going to lead it, but that all changed after Iron Man 2 and going into Whedon's Avengers movie.\nClark Gregg reprised his Iron Man role as Agent Phil Coulson for the sequel, with Samuel L.

{"idx": "14956", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On August 24 Turkish-backed Islamists entered Jarablus without any resistance from ISIS. The Turkish pretext was to expel ISIS from Jarablus, but all the signs suggest that the military invasion is in fact directed against Syrian Kurds.\nEach one of Erdogan\u2019s conspiracies against Kurds in Syria and south east Turkey begins with a terrorist attack, supposedly by ISIS, which for some mysterious reason keeps silent, neither claiming nor denying responsibility. Thus, whenever there is a terrorist attack on Kurdish civilians in Turkey, one can bet that a Turkish plan has just begun to unfold.\nHere is the scenario this time: on August 20 a Kurdish wedding in a city near the Syrian border was attacked, and we have been told by Turkish officials that the attacker was an ISIS member. ISIS did not respond to this allegation one way or the other, like all the past cases of terrorist attacks in Turkey for which ISIS has been blamed. However, ultranationalists carrying Turkish flags and shouting \u201cAllah u Akbar\u201d attacked the Kurdish mourners who were trying to bury dozens of victims, most of whom were children. The aftermath followed a similar pattern to that of other terrorist attacks on Kurds for which Ankara has blamed ISIS.\nIn spite of the mounting evidence of Ankara\u2019s support for and collaboration with ISIS, Erdogan would have us believe that the latest Turkish military invasion in Syria was launched with the express purpose of expelling ISIS from Jarablus. It is obvious that the preparations for the invasion were not the work of a couple of days. In addition to the ten Turkish tanks and special forces that took part in the invasion, more than 5,000 heavily armed Turkman and Arab Islamists were involved.\nThe bottom line is that, contrary to what Joe Biden has been told, the Turkish invasion has nothing to do with expelling ISIS from Jarablus. If anything, Ankara\u2019s aim was to protect Islamists including ISIS from the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and Women\u2019s Protection Units (YPJ). Since the liberation of Manbij, the YPG, YPJ, and their allies in the Syrian Democratic Forces have been advancing quickly to Jarablus, which is exactly why Turkey decided to make a move.\nTurkey had more than two years to \u201cexpel\u201d ISIS. Why is that Erdogan has only now chosen to actively address the \u201cthreat\u201d of ISIS? Also, is it not strange that ISIS withdrew from Jarablus without fighting, enabling (other) Turkish-backed Islamists to take complete control of the city within hours of the beginning of the operation? ISIS has never withdrawn from any town without first putting up a furious fight.\nOnce again, the signs speak to this invasion being yet another manifestation of the strategic alliance between Turkey and ISIS to deceive the world. Erdogan\u2019s regime repeatedly warned Kurds not to advance to Jarablus and even called the Euphrates a \u201cred line\u201d after Kurdish forces liberated Kobane despite Erdogan\u2019s support for ISIS in the fight for that city. It is very telling that Erdogan chose to call his military intervention Euphrates Shield; ISIS had been entrenched on the west side of the Euphrates for more than two years and Kurds were primed to change that reality.\nTo make things worse, Biden, deceived by another Turkish maneuver, has not hesitated to deny support to Kurdish forces west of the Euphrates, in spite of those same forces"}

Hayley Platt reports.\nIt's already the world's biggest processor of diamonds - cutting and polishing 11 out of 12 of the gems. Now India plans to create a new trading hub for rough diamonds in direct competition with Dubai and Belgium. It's one of the ways it hopes to boost exports to cut its record current account deficit. Anoop Mehta is chairman of Bharat Diamond Bourse. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHAIRMAN, BHARAT DIAMOND BOURSE, ANOOP MEHTA, SAYING: \"Eighty percent of the world's rough diamond production comes to India, not directly, but either through Dubai or through Antwerp, so its just necessary that most of the primary producers of rough, that means the people who own the mines, they should have the offices here and sell the rough directly in India, so that the medium and smaller firms can take advantage of it.\" India's diamond industry is already worth around $14 billion dollars. The Council that promotes it says thousands of jobs could be created by persuading companies like de Beers to sell their diamonds in India. (SOUNDBITE) (English) VICE CHAIRMAN, GEMS AND JEWELLERY EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL (GJEPC), PANKAJ KUMAR PAREKH, SAYING: \"If you permit and make the conditions more conducive in India, why would they stay there in Antwerp or in Tel Aviv, they'll come to Mumbai, they'll come to India. Now when they come, they'll give more employment to Indians, its very clear, its very essential.\" India's gem and jewellery trade employs 3.4 million people and forms around 15 percent of its exports. But there's been a 10 percent fall over the past 11 months to around $38bln Exports of cut and polished diamonds faired even worse - down by almost a third. The government has set up a task force to look at the best ways to create a diamond trading hub. It'll present its export import policy later this month."}

{"idx": "14962", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The \"paper or plastic\" era is, gratefully, on its way out. Over the last decade, more than 150 counties and cities in California have outlawed the flimsy, storm-drain-blocking, sea-turtle-choking, virtually immortal single-use plastic bags that grocery stores had been handing out at checkout lines like candy. Similar bans are sweeping the nation.\nTwo years ago, the Legislature passed the nation's first statewide law forbidding most stores in the state from giving out \"free\" plastic carryout bags. (There's nothing actually free about these bags. Retailers pay for them, and the cost becomes part of the overhead factored into the price of goods.) Under the law, if stores offered paper bags for carryout, they'd have to charge at least 10 cents except to certain low-income shoppers, who had to be provided the bags free of charge. It was huge victory in the struggle to turn back the tide of trash that is polluting open spaces and creating islands of plastic in our oceans. But it was distressing news to the makers of single-use plastic bags \u2014 so distressing, in fact, that four large out-of-state plastic-bag companies spent millions of dollars qualifying and campaigning for two measures on the November ballot that could undermine the ban, Propositions 67 and 65.\nArguments against [the] ban are weak, starting with the incredible claim ... that single use-bags are actually good for the environment. They are not.\nIt's clear why they would invest in Proposition 67. It is a referendum on the statewide ban. The mere act of putting the issue on the ballot effectively put the state law on hold; the ban won't go into effect unless a majority of voters pass Proposition 67 in November. They should do so, enthusiastically. A ban on single-use bags won't stop the scourge of plastic waste, but it's practicable place to start.\nAnd a necessary one. Americans use about 100 billion single-use plastic bags a year, as many as 15 billion in California alone. That's down significantly from 30 billion a year before bans began popping up in cities across the state, but it's still too many. Environmentalists put these single-use plastic bags among the biggest sources of litter.\nThe plastic bag industry's arguments against a statewide plastic ban are weak, starting with the incredible claim \u2014 based on a few out-of-context findings in a British study \u2014 that single use-bags are actually good for the environment. They are not. The industry also says that disposable bags are more sanitary, and that the solution to the litter problem is recycling. It is not. Despite years of efforts, the recycling rate of plastic bags in California is about 3%.\nFinally, the industry claims that the ban is a money-making scheme cooked up by the state's grocers to line their pockets with the proceeds from the 10-cent paper bags. That appears to be the reasoning behind Proposition 65, which would require all fees collected for paper carryout bags to be directed to environmental programs.\nOn the surface this measure seems to complement the environmental goals of the bag ban. But coming from the same people so desperately trying to stop the ban, the measure seems more like a cynical ploy to confuse voters or, at the very least, punish the state's grocery stores for supporting the ban.\nThe reality is that the fee for paper bags isn't likely to be a windfall for stores"}

{"idx": "14964", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The role of bass players in mainstream jazz is not to attract attention but to support and sustain. This was never better demonstrated than when Wilfred Middlebrooks, who has died aged 74, helped Ella Fitzgerald busk her way through a version of Mack the Knife that gained her a Grammy award. The album in question was Ella in Berlin, a live recording made before an audience of 12,000 people in 1960, and Ella's selection of the song was both spontaneous and seemingly ill-advised, according to Middlebrooks. \"My heart sank,\" he said later. \"I knew Ella didn't know the tune and nor did I.\" Despite several impromptu changes of key and a sense that, \"Ella was about as lost as she can get and I was hanging on by a fingernail,\" her freewheeling performance - described as \"hilariously inventive\" by one critic - is still talked about today.\nMiddlebrooks was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the son of a bassist who played semi-professionally and a pianist mother. After early piano lessons, he began to dabble with the bass when only 12, encouraged by his grandmother, his obvious promise furthered by lessons with the principal bassist of the Chattanooga Symphony.\nOvercome by wanderlust, the 15-year old Middlebrooks left home without a word, his father's bass in tow, to play with a touring carnival show. \"First he knew was when I sent a card from San Antonio, Texas. He was going to come after me but I travelled too fast,\" Middlebrooks told me in 1961, adding that he was about to return the bass to his father after a lapse of a dozen years. The show travelled around the southern states and the young bassist said he learned a lot from his fellow musicians, including the veteran New Orleans trumpeter Punch Miller. He also fathered a couple of children while on the road but made sure, he told me, to stay in touch as they grew up.\nWhen the show stopped off in New York in 1950, Middlebrooks moved over to ex-Basie saxophonist Tab Smith's swing combo, then very popular on the African-American club circuit. Smith toured extensively, the band's recordings revealing Middlebrooks's sturdy line and strong swing feeling. Drafted into the US Army in 1953 and stationed at Camp Stewart, Georgia, he played tuba in the marching band and string bass in the unit dance orchestra. Briefly back with Smith after being demobbed, he opted to settle in California and immediately began to get work with the city's best modern jazz outfits. His main employer was the distinguished reedman Buddy Collette, but Middlebrooks also performed in clubs and on record with instrumentalists like Frank Rosolino, Plas Johnson and Bill Holman.\nAfter Fitzgerald's manager Norman Granz invited him, in 1958, to join her accompanying band, Middlebrooks stayed on the road with the singer for the next five years. Never free for long, they toured endlessly, including four visits to Britain, often in tandem with Jazz at the Philharmonic, Granz's other concert package. There was a slew of Fitzgerald albums, featuring her quartet led by alternating pianists Paul Smith and Lou Levy with Middlebrooks invariably on hand, until he felt he had to call it a day. \"Ella simply wore people out,\" he said"}

In Asia and South America, hundreds of millions of small landholders, pastoralists and indigenous people do not hold formal land titles. And when it suits governments, they ignore this customary land holding and sell or lease the land to private companies.\nPrivate capital from pension funds and investment firms are chasing food-producing land since they see it as the next big profitable commodity.\n\u201cInvestors are looking for annual returns of 20 and 25 percent and many are getting it,\u201d said Taylor.\nExperts at the University of Georgia recently completed an assessment of 34 land acquisitions in Africa and concluded that in most cases local people lost \u201ctheir land and livelihoods often in the absence of any real benefits\u201d.\nThe U.S., Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and the UK are top foreign investors not only in Africa but in other countries, according to the ILC\u2019s new Land Matrix Global Observatory.

The group considers messages unique when they involve a single e-mail blast with a unique subject line, sent out one at a time and targeting one company or organization. The \"baiting\" sites, which were placed within the messages, also increased to 1142 in October--up from 727 in August, according to the group.\nWhile phishing can involve any type of online communication, many attacks involve e-mail, where fraudsters can easily duplicate a bank's branding and messaging to solicit personal information, said Quinn Jalli, director of privacy and Internet service provider relations for Digital Impact. Citibank, U.S. Bank, and eBay are the most widely phished brands, according to July 2004 data from the Anti-Phishing Working Group. The group reported that Citibank was hijacked by phishers in 682 unique attacks, U.S. Bank was hijacked in 622 unique attacks, and eBay was used in 255 unique attacks.\nDigital Impact, which manages the e-mail marketing campaigns of several large financial and retail marketers, says that phishing has a response rate of 3 percent. The Anti-Phishing Working Group pegs the response rate at an even higher rate of 5 percent.\nLike spam, phishing messages cost next to nothing to produce, but the returns are far greater-- limited only by the amount of money in a user's bank account. The Anti-Phishing Working Group estimates that in the United States, phishing was a $1.2 billion industry last year. The research firm Gartner reported this May that 57 million U.S. adults--about one in three Internet users--have encountered some form of phishing.\nJalli said the increase in both the frequency and quality of phishing messages makes it a \"terrifying\" consumer privacy issue. He's even seen attacks that claim users have been phished when they haven't, asking for credit card information in order to either help track the fraudster or retrieve the funds that were \"lost.\"\nJalli believes advertisers rely too heavily on consumers' ability to identify fraudulent e-mail; he said marketers need to solve the problem if they want to protect their brand.\nDigital Impact's Jalli said there is a need for an authentication system that personalizes e-mail for users, so they will know whether they requested the commercial mail they receive.\nTo that end, earlier this month, the e-mail service provider launched a series of anti-phishing products that marketers can use separately or in concert. One alerts Internet service providers to a phishing attack as soon as it's discovered; another attaches a personalized sender authentication password to commercial e-mails; and another enables a company's customer service department to tell concerned customers definitively whether or not it sent a specific e-mail through an e-mail verification database."}

When he was scheduled to return from combat, civilian friends and family offered to join the celebration and stage a surprise reunion between my kids and my husband. I put my foot down: You may not join in on our reunion and there will be no surprise. I was the poster child of party poopers to everyone \u2013 except my husband and children.\nMilitary friends of mine raised the question of whether surprise military reunions are a good idea; and because the question was raised on Facebook, several civilian friends joined the discussion. Military surprise reunions are a bad idea \u2013 and I would challenge those who think differently to read on and then tell me why they still think they\u2019re a good thing.\nThere have always been surprise reunions, but since the first deployment following 9-11, it\u2019s been too often regarded as an entitlement of civilians who simply can\u2019t be there for the other 99 percent of military life. I have two spurs in my side about surprise reunions. One is the military spouse who thinks surprises are a good idea and the other is the civilian who thinks surprises are good TV.\nThe discussions I\u2019ve had with civilians about this have led me to conclude there\u2019s no talking to many non-military-affiliated people about it. At the risk of generalizing \u2013 oh hell, I\u2019ll just generalize and deal with the consequences: Most civilians genuinely and sincerely want to share and assist in the military experience of deployment every bit as much as military families are there for each other. But civilians can\u2019t be there.\nMost send-offs occur on military installations, so rarely does the civilian world have access. It\u2019s no coincidence that the good-bye isn\u2019t a meme or a reality TV show because there\u2019s no conclusion, no closure, and no moment that segues well into commercial. Many civilians are not familiar with the concept of delaying marital or parental gratification for 6-18 months within a framework that might well involve life-changing injury or death. Since it\u2019s damned difficult to cram the experience of an entire deployment into a 30-second .gif or even a three-minute video, civilians prefer to experience their military myopically and in a more palatable way: the reunion.\nBut let\u2019s talk about the in-between for a moment, when TV cameras are shuttered and civilians are content to put the military out of their minds. Every spouse whose service member is deployed has a routine \u2013 a precious, highly-guarded jewel of family stability that has evolved over years through multiple cities, countries, houses, schools, jobs, friendships and separations. The details that give a military family its stability are boring, repetitive tidbits that don\u2019t make good TV for civilians (which is why that travesty called Army Wives exists as a script).\nCivilians don\u2019t have access to the facilities we use \u2013 from the fitness center where we work off our fears and the housing units where we make our homes to the Family Service Centers where we job hunt, learn new things, and express our anxieties to the commissary where we buy both healthy and indulgent foods. The reunion, however, is prime feeding ground for civilians who want so much to be a part of it all. And the surprise reunion \u2013 often taking place in public where everyone has access \u2013 is the pig\u2019s trough from which many civilians not only stuff their faces, but where, because they weren\u2019t there for the other 99 percent of it, they believe they are owed a"}

Some experts believe the first impression is made by something called the eyebrow flash.\nAnother subtle gesture that makes you more approachable is the head tilt, according to Schafer.

After an initial acknowledgement, then smile.\nThis shows that you are not walking around with a constant silly grin but are actually smiling at the person you are meeting, communication expert and author Leil Lowndes tells Business Insider. It makes your smile seem more personal and sincere.\nConversely, a lack of eye contact can indicate you\u2019re untrustworthy or uninterested in the conversation \u2014 something you obviously want to avoid.\nYour mom\u2019s advice holds true when you are meeting a person for the first time: Slouching does not project well.\nAnother thing you probably learned from Mom: Don\u2019t fidget.\nExperts also say fidgeting can indicate you are lying or bored \u2014 which probably is not what you want to convey to, say, a prospective employer.\nThere are several other ways to raise a new acquaintance\u2019s comfort level. The first is to listen.\nThere is a difference between listening and pretending you are listening \u2014 and most people can tell.\nThe key to showing you are really listening is to not interrupt the speaker, according to Forbes. Wait for a pause to say what you have to say.\nForbes also suggests you give the speaker regular feedback and occasionally paraphrase what they are saying. Both these techniques are signs that you are truly listening, not faking it.\nFlattery is OK, but don\u2019t overdo it.

{"idx": "14995", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Many working professionals must have envied the recent 25% hike in salary of government staffs. However, it is the time of the year when private sector employees go through tedious performance appraisal, which will soon result in the increment of their salaries.\nPerformance appraisal is often viewed as extra work by many supervisors. As the end of the fiscal year approaches, supervisors are flooded with other official affairs, making them least focused on the appraisal. This results in many biases, which some employees tend to cash in by working late even if they don't have to. Others are busy being visible in their supervisor's eye. This behavior leads to regency error where supervisor uses it while appraising to recall and remember recent works of their employees, influencing his decision to rate the employee positively.\nThis is true in several organizations and supervisors need to do something about it. For this, one needs to start with the appraisal system itself. With the changing times, your appraisal system needs upgrades, too. The starting point would be to question if the appraisal system is actually leading to the desired goals of the department. Supervisor needs to understand that performance indicator of each employee should be aligned to the department's indicators. Meeting performance indicators is irrelevant if it doesn't meet the department goals. On this note, let's explore some of the ways we can redefine the performance appraisal system. The recommendations are based on Jobs Dynamics' consulting experience while working with various organizations in Nepal.\n\"One of the candidates was hired as a marketing executive. His duties and responsibilities were well laid out. After a year, his activities were more focused on social media marketing. However, no matter how diligently he works, his performance appraisal doesn't reflect it.\"\nThe problem stated above starts with the job description (JD). Several organizations provide JD to their new employees. However, unless they're promoted to completely new position, it is never revised. We have found that the work newly hired staff do at the beginning of the job and after a year has drastic difference. The performance indicators are developed on the basis of JD issued at the beginning of the job. This leads to poor appraisal system, leaving supervisors and employee discontent with each other. So treat JD as a living document and update it every year to reflect the actual work your employees are doing.\n\"Employee working in one of the leading FMCG companies is a dedicated worker. He enjoys his work and has been doing all the tasks as per his JD. However, the low score he received in his appraisal always baffles him.\"\nThis echoes the reality of many employees. The problem is not the JD this time; it is about the set indicators that the employee is unaware of. Most of the time, employees aren't aware about the parameters within which they'll be assessed. The work is marketing related, except the performance indicator might be approaching an X number of clients or generating Y number of enquires. Thus, allocate sometime for frequent discussion on indicators upon which the employee is going to be appraised.\n\"In a recent incident, one of the supervisors of the bank communicated her junior about a constant work error. The supervisor also offered some solutions to prevent the error. But, the error rate didn't decline. However, after a few months, the error rate came down to almost zero. Now the question is, will the supervisor count this in the appraisal? Does the appraisal system have room to rate such improvement?\"\nAs a supervisor, you should focus on improvement rather than outcomes. Your"}
