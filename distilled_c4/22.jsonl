Just pray you don\u2019t run into BoRn2ReIgN.\nAbyssal Deadspace pockets, introduced in the latest EVE expansion Onslaught, are a new way for players to engage in high-stakes combat. At the end of the hazard-filled Abyssal Deadspace pockets, new stargates beckon players into Abyssal arenas. In the heart of these arenas, rare and valuable loot is held in a secure container. The only thing stopping a player from scooping it into their cargohold and making a clean escape is another player angling for the same target. Once players pass through these stargates, it\u2019s kill or be killed.\nThe introduction of this \u201cinstanced\u201d style of PvP combat has been somewhat controversial in the EVE community. Many players feel that it goes against the spirit that the game has always upheld: EVE is a game of risk vs reward and is very much a sandbox game where anything can happen. Confining players into the dungeon-like areas of Abyssal space where nothing can interfere with their fights is seen as corrupting that sandbox-style gameplay.\nAs you might imagine, BoRn2ReIgN does not share that opinion. \u201cI have been loving it because it involves real risk,\u201d he told Kotaku via Discord chat. Any form of \u201csolo\u201d pvp in normal space typically involves backup from friends should the fight not go well.\u201d This is a not-uncommon complaint from players who enjoy 1v1 content in EVE: some players bring their friends, some players even bring their own alts, running multiple clients to support themselves in engagements where they start to lose. Due to the nature of Abyssal PvP, this is not a possibility. When a player commits to these arenas, they commit alone.\nAbyssal mods are items that are modified by the mutaplasmids found in the sites themselves. These allow a player to reroll the attributes on ship equipment, randomizing each stat positively and negatively. Getting perfect or near-perfect rolls on these modifications can create unique stat arrays that can be more powerful than any other items in the game.\nBoRn2ReIgN\u2019s undefeated streak came to an end after his 29th straight victory, when he was bested by a member of his own alliance. (Apparently there are no friends in the Abyss.) He said that the value of his ship, a Vedmak-class Cruiser, was around 30 billion ISK, well above the cost of some of the game\u2019s Supercarrier Capital Vessels. He was quick to rebuild, however, scoring his next Abyssal kill only two hours later.\nHis winning streak, combined with the semi-stardom from CCP\u2019s comments seem to have put a bit of a target on the Lord of the Abyss, whether in or out of the Abyss. While I was conducting our interview, BoRn2ReIgN stated that his ship was being engaged outside of the Abyss by players that had been lying in wait for him to return from Abyssal to regular space. BoRn2ReIgN had entered the Abyss through the game\u2019s high security space, for added safety when entering and leaving, but his assailants used ships designed to do as much damage as possible before the in-game police force could destroy them.

While the research was a primarily statistical exercise, it still yielded significant clues about associations, which may also be causes.\nWhat the researchers call \u201csocial and family context\u201d clearly matters. Almost a quarter (24%) of people aged five to 19 who have a mental disorder were in a family that have been struggling to function well, the academics found. In comparison, far fewer of them \u2013 just 10% \u2013 were found to be surrounded by \u201chealthy family functioning\u201d.\nSimilarly, 28% of troubled youngsters have a parent who has been struggling with mental illness themselves, compared with 9% of children without mental ill health..\nHaving a parent who has been receiving disability-related income also appeared to be a risk factor, or at least to involve a statistically interesting correlation.\nProf Tamsin Ford, one of the co-authors, said that \u201ca variety of family adversities\u201d was also part of the explanation. That could be parental separation or a financial crisis in their home, explained Ford, a child psychiatrist who focuses on child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Exeter.\nA child who has been socially isolated \u2013 who has low levels of social support or does not take part in clubs or organisations in or out of school \u2013 \u201cwere all associated with the presence of mental disorder\u201d, the researchers found.\nWith schooling, 8.5% of children with a disorder had been excluded compared with just 0.8% of those who have no mental ailment at all. And while 6.8% of troubled children had been excluded from school, that compared with only 0.5% of all pupils.\nThe age group for whom it was hardest to pinpoint what caused their mental ill-health was children aged between two and four. Among these preschoolers, one in 19 (5.5%) had a mental disorder, most of which were behavioural disorders (2.5%) such as oppositional defiant disorder (1.9%).\nLittle-known outside psychiatric circles, these disorders involve extreme temper tantrums and severe disobedience which have been judged to be developmentally inappropriate, severe and persistent, and to cause distress or impair the child\u2019s normal functioning. This new study was the first of the three editions that have been published since 1999 to investigate this age group, so there were no other figures with which to compare the 5.5% finding.\nThe picture with them has also been complicated by the fact that some of the mental illness in these children was autistic spectrum disorder (1.4%), which is a neurodevelopmental condition, and also that the 5.5% included problems with sleeping, feeding and toileting. There was also the fact that anxiety and depression, the likely causes of which were easier to identify, have been absent in preschoolers.\nSo, while these two-, three- and four-year-olds were not simply displaying \u201cthe terrible twos\u201d, and have been displaying symptoms which psychiatrists could identify from the diagnostic manual that guides their decisions, explaining why many of these children present as they did was not easy.\nThose young people aged between 11 and 16 with a disorder were much more likely than their mentally untroubled peers to have taken illicit drugs, drunk alcohol or tried a cigarette.\nAmong these children, the use of social media, widely"}

For Israel, the ultimate cost of this inaction could be existential.\nWhy? National leaders rely upon hope. Again and again, however, they hope too much. Sometimes, this misplaced optimism has the emotionally satisfying, but strategically injurious, effect of blocking off productive policies. It may even have the effect of encouraging catastrophic war and terrorism.\nNotwithstanding the right of anticipatory self-defense under international law, neither Israel nor the United States has been willing to act preemptively. Iran continues its unhindered march toward full membership in the Nuclear Club.\nIsrael and the US, it seems, will have to seek safety in the so-called logic of deterrence. Ironically, this will make them both dependent on the always-problematic assumption of rationality.\nWe begin to see the self-destructive circularity of current reasoning in both Jerusalem and Washington. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Barack Obama may vainly attempt to achieve stable deterrence with Tehran. Hoping that a new balance of terror with Iran could be premised upon the US-USSR Cold War model, Washington and Jerusalem will ultimately be disappointed. This model simply doesn't apply here.\nDeterrence will likely be grafted upon very weak conceptual and psychological foundations. For Israel, a principal component of strategic policy has always been to keep its bomb in the basement. In Israel, there must soon be a renewed examination of continued nuclear ambiguity.\nArguably, at least until now, nuclear opacity has \"worked.\" Although Israel's nuclear ambiguity has obviously done little to deter \"ordinary\" conventional enemy aggressions or multiple acts of terror, it has succeeded in keeping the country's enemies from mounting truly existential aggressions. These aggressions could have been mounted without nuclear or biological weapons, simply because - as the strategic theorist Clausewitz once wrote - there does come a point when \"mass counts.\"\nIsrael's many enemies have always had an obvious advantage in \"mass.\" None of Israel's foes has \"the bomb,\" but together - in a determined collaboration - they could still have acquired the capacity to carry out substantial assaults. Acting collectively, these states and their assorted insurgent proxies, even without nuclear weapons, could already have inflicted huge harms upon the Jewish State.\nIsrael's policy of deliberate ambiguity will not work indefinitely. To be deterred, a fully nuclear Iran would need assurance that Israel's own nuclear weapons were invulnerable and penetration-capable. Any Iranian judgments about Israel's willingness to retaliate with nuclear weapons would largely depend upon a foreknowledge of these weapons.\nIranian perceptions of only mega-destructive Israeli nuclear weapons could undermine the credibility of Israel's deterrence. Ironically, Israel's credibility could vary inversely with the perceived destructiveness of its nuclear arms. In coexisting with an already-nuclear Iran, Israel would likely benefit not from any increased nuclear secrecy, but rather from expanded nuclear disclosure. This would mean a full or partial end to Israel's \"bomb in the basement.\"\nIran might decide to share some of its nuclear components and materials with Hizbullah or another kindred terrorist group. To prevent this, Jerusalem would need to convince Iran that Israel possesses a range of distinctly usable nuclear options. Once again, nuclear ambiguity might not remain sufficiently persuasive to ensure Israel's nuclear deter"}

It is a tribute to both the MPs\u2019 commitment and the gravity of the issue that such a diverse group of parliamentarians could produce a report with real substance.\nThe primary duty of Parliament since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 is to keep a vigilant and critical eye on how government raises and spends our money.

Unfortunately Parliament\u2019s authority has been steadily eroding over the past decades, therefore, it is gratifying to see our current Members reasserting their authority.\nIt is not just in Canada that parliamentarians need to reassert their authority. Parliamentarians around the world have failed to represent their constituents, thereby allowing dictators and corruption to flourish. Periodically we see revolutions (the Arab Spring) or civil war (Syria) but developing parliaments into serious institutions of democratic accountability to create prosperity takes much time and unsung effort.\nNo one votes for poverty yet we see misery and despair around the world; mostly due to parliamentarians who do not or will not exercise democratic accountability over their government.\nGOPAC engages parliamentarians in many countries to build parliamentary coalitions to combat corruption, educate parliamentarians in their responsibilities and to provide leadership for better governance.\nIn September GOPAC will hold a high-level meeting in the European Parliament for a few elected representatives from nations with presidential style governments to analyse how we can improve democratic oversight in presidential systems.\nThe struggle to improve democracy is on-going but not always on the front page.

An exploratory meeting was recently held in Rochester by the 9-12 Group.\nTo put these sentiments into historical context, during the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783, many of the patriots fighting a despotic British government, had been members of Rogers' Rangers, a provincial military company that originated in New Hampshire, and which had been drafted into the British army to fight in the French and Indian wars. The force was then revived to fight for the American forces against the British crown. There was a real fear, in the New Hampshire of 1784, that oppression, so recently repulsed, could easily attempt to reestablish itself.\nThat same apprehension has been felt by some New Hampshire residents, albeit a smallish minority, in recent years.\nAs a preface to the meeting in March at the Church of Christ in East Rochester, organizer Jerry DeLemus posted on the Rochester 9-12 site, \u201cWe will be having a discussion on the formation of a militia group in NH. We will also be discussing the assaults on our constitutional rights as free citizens in America. There comes a time when the loss of your freedom becomes obvious.\nDeLemus went on to share his fears, thus, \u201cI believe that we have another financial collapse coming soon and it will be worse than the one in 2008. There are stark differences we must realize that we have nearly a 0% interest rate and our debt is nearly double. Not to mention our credit rating has been dropped. On top of this we have a government that has no respect or regard for the rule of law as provided in our Constitution.\nAttending the 9-12 meeting, in March, was NH State Rep. Dan Itse from Fremont, who was invited to discuss the issue.\nIn 2008, Itse introduce HB 1431-FN, an act establishing a permanent state defense force, by revising the militia statutes relative to the state guard. After debate, the bill was deemed inexpedient to legislate, which meant that it died.\nIn fact, Article 51 of the New Hampshire Constitution specifically mentions the training, instruction, exercising and governing of a militia, and the commander in chief of such a force is explicitly stated to be the NH Governor, who is currently Maggie Hassan.\n\u201cI thought it was a very good start. I think we need to be careful that we don't try to reinvent the wheel. It is a good thing that we are coming together and discussing these sort of things,\u201d posted someone identifying himself as Dave Ellis. According to the site, \u201c80 patriots\u201d attended the meeting.\nDeLemus, a former U.S. Marine, and a one-time candidate for Rochester mayor, said the discussion about the formation of a militia was to enquire into its legality, and to ascertain if people wanted one.\nA history buff, DeLemus said that at the start of the War of Independence, only 10 percent of the population supported the Colonialists.\n\u201cThen there was the Boston Massacre, and the British started to come after the powder and shot in New Hampshire,\u201d said DeLemus, explaining how the tide of public sentiment was"}

Indeed, they are killing us, and most of us don\u2019t know it.\nIn clear graphs charting diseases such as thyroid cancer, autism, Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis, diabetes, liver cancer, stroke, obesity, senile dementia, kidney disease, breast cancer, celiac disease and gluten intolerance, governmental studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention record the rise of these diseases, along with the USDA\u2019s tracking of the use of glyphosate and GMO foods since the 1990s.\nHundreds of studies are cited, and the science is available to confirm.\nThis pamphlet is both enlightening and dangerous.\nThe major international corporations responsible for this desecration will not be neutral in their response. We have watched that already, like the tobacco companies who gave sworn testimony that nicotine does not cause disease and is not addictive. We saw how accurate that was.\nSo why are the corporations doing this? Why would they destroy our food, our bodies, our land? Where do they think they will live?\nPerhaps, at last, the love of money truly is the root of all evil.\nAlerting the public to dangers is not enough, so this publication suggests many alternative actions for you to do to protect yourself, your children and your environment.

However, if you\u2019re serving an elegant holiday dinner, you\u2019re more likely to prefer a warm centerpiece dish. A fully cooked ham is still a time-saving option; you\u2019ll just need to allot time to heat it in the oven once it\u2019s thawed.\nStart by thawing a fully cooked ham in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours.\nTo keep your ham extra moist, always put the cut-side down. You might also consider placing a baking rack in the pan and adding a quarter-inch of water before placing the ham on the rack.\nFor a spiral-cut, bone-in ham, heat the oven to 325 F. Remove ham from film and foil. Place ham cut-side down on a raised edge baking pan lined with foil. Heat uncovered 60-75 minutes for the entire ham or 10 minutes per pound for smaller portions.\nFor a boneless ham, heat the oven to 350 F. Place the ham, cut-side down, on a raised edge baking pan lined with foil. Cover the ham tightly with foil and heat 35-40 minutes.\nAnother option for adding extra juicy flavor is a glaze, which can be as simple as dissolving three parts brown sugar into one part honey in a small saucepan. Or for a more elegant affair, consider a fruit-infused glaze to complement the savory pork.\nIf you always thought a ham is a ham, it\u2019s time to think again. From the type of meat to the smoking preparation to specialized slicing that makes serving easy, there are plenty of options to consider from a supplier like Omaha Steaks when choosing the right ham.\nFor an elegant gathering that demands premium ingredients, an all-natural Duroc Boneless Country Ham may be the answer. These hams tend to feature more marbling for an exceptionally rich flavor and texture, making for a tender, savory and juicy main course with no basting or injection needed.\nPut a little flair in your Easter meal with a uniquely flavored ham like the Pecanwood Smoked Flank Ham, smoked with real pecan wood for 8 hours to add a rich yet mellow smoky flavor.

We had to do some strategic things and work to find people who really wanted the fruit and would be willing to go the long haul,\" Conie further said.\nToday's shipment is comprised of between 900 and 1,000 boxes containing 18 kilogrammes (40 pounds) of the fruit destined for the ripe-banana trade. This initial contract is for one container per week for the six months, with the option of upping it to three containers per week thereafter.\nFrom the Trinidad end, the success is due largely to a businessman's appreciation for the high quality of the Jamaican fruit.\nThis businessman is the largest importer of bananas into Trinidad.\nHe had a chance to visit fields in Jamaica and see the steps in banana cultivation, harvesting, and packing. The deal was sealed after he sampled the ripe fruit.\n\"The quality of Jamaican fruit is really what is the distinguishing factor, and what we are doing with certification, technology transfer and extension services is helping the small farmers to come up to the level that they can,\" Conie explained.\n\"He wanted to see what we have, and because the quality is so good, he wants to up his price over there. We want him to up the price over here as well, so we think that six months will give us enough leeway to increase output. He is going to distribute in the Massy group, and at least 20 of the retailers are already asking for Jamaican bananas. We have a lot of fruit that's going to come in very soon in the Spring Gardens Agro Park, a lot of young fields that are coming in, all for this market.\"\nThe Trinidad-based businessman is already exploring the option of importing potato and yam as well from Jamaica.\n\"He is trying to get a permit for potatoes and yam, so they can get that from Jamaica as well.\nThis is paving the way for other crops and other products because the trade between Trinidad and Jamaica comes one-way. It is significant that it is now going the other way, and this now will make openings for other things to go the other way,\" the general manager argued."}

{"idx": "22048", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Understanding the human ability to distinguish different odors may open the door to new ways of thinking about how the brain processes information and how we learn.\nOur senses are drawn to areas of high information. That means points of transition, transformation, the edges of things, and lots and lots of bright colors. Most science consists of measurements taken from these observations such as the wavelengths of sound and light, timbre, texture and taste.\nAnd yet, until now, science has been unable to clearly define the edges of certain phenomena which Thomas Cleland, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Cornell University, calls \u201carbitrary sensory systems,\u201d systems whose boundaries cannot be easily quantified \u2013 such as the sense of smell.\nAs it turns out, in the process of attempting to describe how the olfactory bulb operates, Cleland may have stumbled upon more than a way to delineate the edges of smell, but to open up other areas of high information within the human mind itself, the edges between certain concepts.\nThe way we perceive the world is largely based on how successfully we distinguish one thing from another. The image of a cobalt blue coffee mug, for instance, might seem to spin off into infinity, indistinguishable from the image of the walnut table on which it sits. The sound of an approaching car would blend into the whirling of wind in leaves if auditory systems couldn\u2019t detect subtle differences in the sound's pitch and timbre. Touch easily distinguishes one thing from another, even down to such subtle differences as the direction of grain in a recently cut piece of wood. And yet, models describing the sense of smell remain evasive.\n\u201cThink about an odor in a nice clean background. Even then the odor has variability. The stimulus is never the same twice,\u201d says Cleland. He uses the various strains, cultivars and degrees of ripeness that might affect the scent of an orange to demonstrate the complexity of such a sensation, and the difficulty in quantifying it precisely.\nAfter multiple percepts of an odor \u201cYou learn to draw the border between orange and tangerine or orange and lemon, dynamically, using your own nose and your own experience,\u201d says Cleland.\nCleland calls such similarly similar phenomena--phenomena that are not similar in a measurable sensory space--\u201carbitrary sensory systems.\u201d He describes the findings as both \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d and is proud at the apparent similarity between his work with the olfactory bulb, and the way that humans learn.\nIf the models Cleland is developing for smell hold up to scrutiny they will have successfully described what up until now has been considered in only the most abstract terms. If the models prove analogous to other arbitrary sensory systems it would open the door to new ways of understanding the way our brains process more than just smell, but learns in general.\nCleland says his work is an attempt at taking the \u201cgrand concepts that people like [Dr. Gary] Aston-Jones are describing in large memory systems\u201d and boil them down to the \u201csmaller neuronetwork of the olfactory bulb.\u201d Read one of Aston-Jones\u2019 grand concepts here.\nSee what Cleland has to say about the smell of female tears at NPR."}
{"idx": "22049", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: President Trump deserves credit for agreeing to meet with a delegation of frustrated and emotional survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Given his all too cozy and politically motivated alliance with the National Rifle Association, he was caught between the students\u2019 demands for tighter gun restrictions and his supporters\u2019 concern about sliding down the slippery slope of Second Amendment infringement.\nAt the end of the \u201clistening session,\u201d Trump followed the NRA playbook. He offered up the gun lobby\u2019s rather minor concessions \u2014 banning bump stocks and maybe raising the legal age for purchasing a high-powered weapon of mass murder destruction from 18 to 21. You could probably count on one hand the total number of mass killings over the past three decades that those changes might have affected.\nStill, these are beneficial baby steps that can hopefully be embraced by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including those in the GOP (which should be renamed the \u201cGun Owners Party\u201d).\nNot so palatable, and that\u2019s putting it mildly, is Trump\u2019s suggestion that we arm as many as 20% of our nation\u2019s school teachers \u2014 concealed carry for educators. Supporters of firearms-for-faculty maintain that ever since the early 1990s, when Congress established schools as gun-free zones, an armed assailant, be it a student\u2013insider or a stranger\u2013intruder, could be assured of facing little or no opposition. Maybe Johnny wouldn\u2019t be so quick to bring a loaded gun to school if he knew that teachers and administrators were packing heat.\nHowever, rather than a deterrent for someone who himself may be prepared to die, this could actually be an incentive. Johnny, long feeling obscure and disrespected, might believe he could become a big man on campus by shooting it out with the deputy principal at high noon in the school cafeteria.\nTrump has shown a tendency to think that many of his borrowed ideas and pronouncements are original. But in this case, as with bump stocks and raising the legal gun purchase age, he is simply promoting the NRA agenda. Just days after the December 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting, the powerful gun group announced its interest in funding a National School Shield Program, an effort to provide every school in America with armed guards, including retired police officers and trained volunteers. Although the NRA failed to see its dream fulfilled, several states have in recent years enacted bills to allow licensed teachers to keep their weapons locked and loaded while at school.\nWhat level of training is sufficient so that we can trust a teacher\u2019s judgment and accuracy when suddenly confronted with a calm and heavily armed assailant? And exactly what type of guns would be permitted for the faculty that could compete against an intruder wielding a high-powered assault rifle and toting enough ammunition to turn the school corridor into a shooting gallery?\nRather than equipping schools with armed guards, be they volunteer marksmen or teachers with a passion for guns, maybe Trump would like to propose that big, beautiful walls be erected around the perimeter of every school. That would cost billions, but maybe Trump could convince Mexico to foot the bill.\nI\u2019m not serious, of course. But I also can\u2019t take seriously the idea of turning educators into executioners.\nFor teachers, marksmanship should be about A\u2019s and B\u2019s. Not guns and ammo.\nJames Alan Fox is the Lipman Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University and a member of the USA TODAY Board"}

Right-wing parties will command a Knesset majority, while the right-wing parties with pretensions of supplanting Likud as the flagship of the right-wing bloc (i.e. New Right and Zehut) failed to cross the electoral threshold as of press time. This enables Netanyahu to build a coalition with Orthodox and other sectoral parties without a stake in the prime minister\u2019s political demise.\nTo aggrandize himself at Netanyahu\u2019s expense, Bennett often chastised the prime minister for not responding militantly enough to Hamas provocations, and in 2014 enthusiastically supported the proposed \u201cLaw for the Advancement and Protection of Written Journalism in Israel.\u201d Introduced by then-Labor faction chairman Eitan Cabel, the legislation would have outlawed free newspapers and was targeted at the pro-Netanyahu Israel Hayom, Israel\u2019s paper with the largest daily circulation. Then, in 2018, Bennett threatened to topple Netanyahu\u2019s government unless given the defense ministry, a ploy that hastened his political oblivion.\nSince Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit announced his intention to indict the prime minister on one count of bribery and three counts of breach of trust, Netanyahu can ill afford coalition partners relishing his political demise. Therefore, New Right and Zehut\u2019s unexpected failure to cross the electoral threshold due to the defection of their putative supporters to other right-wing parties represents a coup for the prime minister.\nThe parties likely to join his government are mainly interested in catering to their respective constituencies (e.g. haredim, West Bank settlers and Russian immigrants) \u2013 and many of their leaders, including Shas\u2019s Arye Deri and Yisrael Beytenu\u2019s Avigdor Liberman, are no strangers to legal scrutiny. Deri previously served 22 months in prison for bribery \u2013 and last November, the police recommended that he be indicted on counts of fraud and breach of trust.\nLikewise, the Israel Police investigated Liberman for fraud, money laundering, breach of trust and witness tampering. Consequently, despite past rhetoric opposing a law giving the premier immunity from prosecution, the parties in Netanyahu\u2019s fifth government might be more sympathetic than either New Right or Zehut would have been to parliamentary immunity legislation in exchange for benefits to their constituents, as well as for its own sake.\nLiberman and Moshe Kahlon, chairman of the Kulanu Party, each at some point entertained replacing Likud as the political heir of Revisionist Zionism. Yisrael Beytenu\u2019s influence gradually increased from the late 1990s through 2009, when it won 15 Knesset seats and attracted substantial right-wing support outside of its Russian immigrant base. But Yisrael Beytenu\u2019s pan-Israeli appeal has waned in recent elections while its ethnic base has increasingly assimilated, making even crossing the electoral threshold a challenge.\nWhen Kahlon, a former Likud MK, formed his Kulanu Party in 2014, he professed to be recreating the L"}

Exchanges had hoped that computerized platforms would allow the markets to open without endangering even a smaller number of staff members.\nBut after daylong discussions with city and state officials, brokerages, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Sifma, the market operators decided to be even more cautious and halt trading for the day, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\u201cWe support the consensus of the markets and the regulatory community that the dangerous conditions developing as a result of Hurricane Sandy will make it extremely difficult to ensure the safety of our people and communities, and safety must be our first priority,\u201d the N.Y.S.E. said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe decision came late: Nasdaq made its final determination around 10:30 Sunday night, according to a person briefed on the exchange\u2019s decision.\nUnder the N.Y.S.E.\u2019s contingency plan, traders would have routed their orders onto the company\u2019s electronic exchange, while electronic options trading would operate normally.

I think the real decline always occurs in the last 100 days of the year,\" said Tom Kloza, oil analyst with GasBuddy.com.\nU.S. refining capacity\u201417.9 million barrels\u2014is at the highest level it's been in 33 years, when it was briefly more than 18 million barrels. For a nation that was once concerned about a lack of new refineries, the industry has been expanding existing facilities, adding more than 2 million barrels a day capacity since the late 1990s.\n\"It's the highest since 1981. That says to me rather than building new refineries, we've just expanded existing ones to get the economies of scale,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"In 1981 there were 341 refineries.\" Now, there are 142.\n\"A lot of 1981's capacity was not complex, or sophisticated. Back in 1981, we weren't exporting about 1.5 million barrels a day of diesel and gasoline,\" said Kloza.\nThe U.S. exports, which go to Europe and South America, are near record levels, but they could increase. \"The refining capacity number may go up in the next couple of years. There are a lot of studies that say if we don't lift the export ban on crude, we build another half a million barrels a day or even a million barrels a day of refining capacity in the U.S., and we'll become more of an export nation because our crude prices and natural gas prices are cheaper than everybody else. It's a slight edge, but it's an edge,\" Kloza said.\nGasoline prices typically decline between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, but this year prices rose, as the Iraq situation drove up crude oil prices, Kloza said.\nRefinery utilization is also rising as the industry brings more capacity back online, some of which was offline due to routine maintenance. Refining utilization rose to 91.4 percent, and gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.2 million barrels, in the week ended June 27, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nAccording to Platt's, a large crude oil unit at Phillips 66's plant in Montana is adding 58,000 barrels a day after going offline due to a fire June 11.\nExxon Mobil restarted a unit June 12 at its 200,700 barrel-per-day refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, after maintenance, and Exxon also returned its Beaumont, Texas, refinery to normal operations last week after planned work, according to Platt's.\n\""}

In the 70 years since the attack on Pearl Harbor, a dramatic photo of female firefighters has been published many times in magazines, history books and online as a depiction of action on Dec. 7, 1941. We published it this past week on msnbc.com. Now, with the help of our readers, we've located one of the women, who says the photo was definitely not taken on that day.\nThe photo as distributed by Getty Images.\nShe's the second from the right in the iconic photo, Katherine Lowe, still living in Hawaii at age 96, where she has great-great-grandchildren and goes bowling twice a week. She can take us back to a time and place that few remember.\nKatherine Lowe, 96, right, looks at the photo of firefighters at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, with her daughter Yvonne Hernandez, at their home, Sunday, Dec. 11, in Laie, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu.\nHere's a photo of Lowe made at her home on Sunday.\nLowe said the wartime photo was certainly not taken on Dec. 7, 1941, the day the Imperial Japanese Navy shocked the United States into joining World War II. On that Sunday morning she was headed to church when the bombing started, and she went ahead anyway because she wasn't sure what else to do. But she and her friends from the Dole pineapple factory did soon go to work as civilian workers at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and one of their duties was to fight fires. She said the photo was probably taken at a training exercise during the war. She said she had no idea that her photo was in history books.\nSo the bottom line: These women were female firefighters at Pearl Harbor, the place. To that extent the photo is authentic. But they weren't fighting a fire when this photograph was taken, and they weren't fighting any fires on Dec. 7, the day we remember every year on Pearl Harbor Day. In addition to Lowe's account, there is strong documentary evidence that this is a Navy publicity photo taken to showcase the roles of women during the war.\nHere's the story of the photo and the female firefighters of Pearl Harbor.\n\"If only we knew more...\"\nThis past Wednesday, on the 70th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, msnbc.com's PhotoBlog published a selection of historic photos provided by photo agencies.

And although it might sound like a tourist trap, it's really a delightful enclave of year-round Christmas spirit in the heart of Finnish Lapland. The capital is Santa Claus Village, right on the Arctic Circle.\nAbout a decade ago, the government of Lapland proclaimed this vast unspoiled haven for naturalists and people who love sports, as the domain of St. Nick.\nAccording to Finnish legend, Santa Claus actually lives at Korvatunturi, in the wilderness near the Russian border. But that's too remote, so Santa Claus Village was built just two miles north of Rovaniemi, the capital and commercial center of Finnish Lapland. The site is where Eleanor Roosevelt was taken when she asked to visit the Arctic Circle; the cabin built to accommodate her has been incorporated into the village.\nYou might expect Santa Claus Village to be quaint and old-fashioned, with gingerbread houses and gaslight. But the Lapland version is Finnish modern, as acclimatized to be warm in winter and cool in summer.\nThe main building, designed by the Arrak Group of architects and inaugurated in June 1985, is a handsome wooden structure with two levels of workshops, exhibitions and activity rooms, boutiques and an all-important post office, all centered around a spacious lobby. A large fir tree is always decorated, even in summer months, when Lapland's days are long and the weather is balmy.\nSanta Claus is usually there too. But visitors in summer are advised to phone first--the village is open daily, but Santa may have gone fishin' on one of Lapland's well-stocked lakes.\nThe building's activity rooms often house creative workshops for children, who can paint pictures about Santa Claus or anything else, or write letters to be sent to family or friends at home, complete with the Santa Claus postmark.\nFrom the same post office, you can mail some wonderful gifts, all sold at Santa Clause Village shops.\nThe shops are in the village's main building, a handsome two-level wooden structure. There are lots of playthings, of course. Wonderful wooden pull toys include rabbits with wiggling ears (about $15), cats whose heads turn from side to side (about $12) as though they were looking for the toy mice (about $8) that look a bit like miniature wooden Volkswagens with leather tails. There are little autos (about $15), locomotives with hook-up cars (about $10-$25), airplanes (about $15) and boats (about $7).\nThese, plus assorted rattles, puzzles, boxes and blocks, are handmade locally. The same company makes darling Raggedy Ann and Andy-like dolls with yellow hair, as well as pudgy baby dolls that are bald.\nRag dolls and cuddly stuffed animals, including an unusual assortment of Arctic species such as reindeer, some with Rudolph-red noses, are made in Santa's workshop, located nearby at Ranua Animal Park, where live animals are also kept.

Batteries are specced in Amp-Hours, not amps--amperage is a rate, Ah is a quantity indicating the amount of energy stored in the battery. Typical Alkaline capacity is ~2800 mAh, so if you get around 2.8 hours of use, the device draws on average 1 Amp. However, this is not a reliable way to spec the current of a DC adapter. Is there not a label with the input power requirements on the device, or is this something that was not ever designed to run from an adapter?\nBe sure to follow the wires/metal strips, as the batteries can be packed next to each other yet wired end to end.\nIf you're trying to build an adapter and you didn't know this or couldn't look it up without asking us, I'm going to kindly suggest you may want to uptake a different quest.\nSofaKing, first figure out how it's wired. Like Jimbo asks, is it four in a series, two series of two, or four parellel? That's going to determine the voltage (either 6, 3, or 1.5 V). The aperage rating of any DC adapter you buy is going to be the maximum. Basically, the device is going to draw however much current it needs; a 500 mA power source might be overkill if the device is only drawing 200 mA, but it won't hurt anything. The danger is if the output of the DC adapter is too low: you run the risk of overheating and burning it out, or causing a fire in an extreme case.\nFor a device that uses four AA batteries, 500 mA is probably sufficient, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. Hopefully someone else can give you suggestions on how to estimate or measure the current requirements.\nHow long [hours] do the batteries last in the device when run at full power until they die? What is the capacity [mA hour] of the batteries tested? From this we can estimate average current [mA] required, since we know, approximately, the voltage of each battery as 1.5 [V].\nOnce you figure out how things are wired up, it will probably be easier to just make the adapter and test it out than it will be to waste time agonizing over whether it will work or not.

What's more, if oil prices keep their current levels, the country could turn into the black by 2019 or even earlier.\nThe deficit-free scenario for 2019 uses base-line international oil prices of US$45 a barrel, so growth could come earlier if the OPEC agreement leads to prices consistently higher than $50, closer to the US$60 mark or, who knows, possibly even higher.\nSiluanov has already said that as long as prices stay at US$50, Russia's budget will get additional revenues of about US$16 billion (1 trillion rubles).\nIn late December, President Vladimir Putin went further, saying that every US$10 rise in oil prices will bring into the federal budget around US$28.6 billion (1.75 trillion rubles) plus another US$12.23 billion (750 billion rubles) in revenues for the local oil industry.\nWhat's more, for this year, the federal budget - stipulating a deficit of US$45 billion (2.753 trillion rubles) - uses as a base-line an oil price of US$40 per barrel and an inflation rate of no more than 4 percent. To compare, in 2016, the inflation rate reached 5.6 percent--not too good but a definite improvement from the 12.9 percent at end-2015. So, a 4-percent inflation rate could be achievable and coupled with the very pessimistic oil price base scenario could turn Russia into an overachiever, which, of course, could be the very reason for the pessimistic scenario.\nWe wrote on Oilprice.com earlier how Russia basically outsmarted OPEC, reaping all the benefits from the output cut while risking far less in terms of market share loss due to a production cut. What's more, according to Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov, Russia won't even have to cut its exports, as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Middle Eastern producers have had to because of the agreement.\nOn the contrary, Russia is actually planning to increase crude exports this year, albeit by just \"a little more\" than the 2016 figure, which has been estimated at 253.5 million tons, a 4.8-percent rise on 2015.

The seller is from Canada, and used it as a winter home only, so it is in great condition. Since the seller normally pays for title, he is also choosing the title company, which he says is brand new. Should we have any concerns about using a new company?\n- Richard and Mary R.\nLaw firms and title companies play a vital role in real estate transactions. The owner's title policy provides you protection if it is later discovered that there is a defect in your title. These defects occur more frequently than one would imagine, either through improperly signed deeds, incorrect legal descriptions and other mistakes the closing agent may make. Without title insurance, you may find your only recourse is against the previous owner, who may be unavailable, or in the case of a foreign seller, unreachable. Regardless of the longevity of the company, I recommend that the parties research carefully all parties in the transaction. If a law firm or title company is often being sued for negligence, this is a company to stay away from. If the seller is proposing to use a company that has red flags like this, you can make a requirement of the closing for it to occur elsewhere, where both parties feel confidence.\nThe issue that is of most concern in this matter is the foreign seller. As discussed in a previous column, foreign sellers of real estate are required to have 15 percent of their gross sales price withheld and sent to the IRS, which is applied against their taxable income. This is where using an experienced law firm or title company is key. If the FIRPTA withholding is mishandled, it is the BUYER that is responsible for interest, penalties and potentially the entire amount itself. I have had several clients that have closed with local title companies where the withholding was mishandled, leading to IRS claims of lien. In one case, an unsuspecting buyer had their Social Security check garnished!\nIn any case where a buyer is purchasing real estate from a foreign seller, we recommend seeking legal counsel to ensure the buyer's interests are protected. There are several steps that can be taken to make sure the IRS doesn't come knocking on your door, but some of these require amendments to the initial contract, before being signed.\nIn conclusion, although it is recommended that any buyer seek legal counsel before entering a real estate contract, it is particularly important when purchasing real estate from a foreign seller."}

Those gaps, the expert warned, posed an immediate fire safety threat to the occupants.\nBut the finding by the Allana, Buick and Bers firm was kept secret for a year.

In August, city inspectors met with her, but they left without issuing a citation.\nIn fact, Pretlow allowed several authorities to inspect of her leaking windows just this week.\nAs many of you may have heard, the City issued a Notice of Violation against our building.

Arkansas is leading the 15 states that include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.\nThe states\u2019 brief points to an Arkansas Supreme Court decision that overruled a state court judge and allowed executions to go forward in what the states now argue is a nearly identical case involving the drug company McKesson Medical-Surgical and stocks of its drug vecuronium bromide. At the time, Arkansas was on track to execute eight men in an 11-day span. It ultimately put four men to death over eight days.\nAlvogen in Nevada, like McKesson in Arkansas, argues that it doesn\u2019t want its drugs used in executions and that prison officials improperly obtained its products for a lethal injection.\nHikma Pharmaceuticals USA, a maker of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, has joined Alvogen in a bid to stop the use of its product as the second of three drugs in a lethal combination never before tried in any state.\nThat was over a Nevada state attorney\u2019s objection that it was ironic that the maker of a drug blamed for illegal overdoses every day was claiming its reputation would be hurt by being associated with a lawful execution.\nA judge in Las Vegas who is due to hear arguments Sept. 10 is expected to decide Thursday whether Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, maker of the third drug, the muscle paralyzing drug cisatracurium, can join Alvogen and Hikma in the Nevada case.\nThat could pit at least three prominent pharmaceutical firms in a Nevada court against more than half the 31 states in the U.S. with the death penalty.\n\u201cI think states are attempting to make this a showdown,\u201d said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C.\nNevada, which hasn't executed an inmate since 2006, has become a model of the trouble that death penalty states have had in recent years obtaining drugs for lethal injections.\nA judge blocked Dozier\u2019s execution just hours before it was scheduled in July so she could hear Alvogen\u2019s claim that Nevada improperly obtained midazolam.\nNevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt has asked the state Supreme Court to quickly overrule the judge so that Dozier\u2019s twice-postponed lethal injection can be put back on track for mid-November.\nDozier, 47, is a twice-convicted killer for drug-related slayings in 2002 in Phoenix and Las Vegas.

It is in that spirit that the plan by two members to introduce a measure to reinstate the 104 teachers who were fired earlier this month should go forward -- with guidance from experts, not simply as perceived by members of the board.\nRalph R. Hernandez and Mary Ruth Kapsiak were on target when they said the district needs to find the money to restore positions that have a direct bearing on classrooms. That is especially important given that 13 of the city's schools, or about one-fourth, have been designated by the state as persistently lowest-achieving.\nMeanwhile, the board-approved 2011-12 district budget included the teacher cuts, which come to roughly $5.8 million. To find the money, Hernandez and Kapsiak are eyeing the district's non-union, or exempt, central office staff, which has ballooned to 28 -- or doubled in size -- during Superintendent James A. Williams' six-year tenure.\nBut the board may not have enough information to make an intelligent decision as to whether that money could be drawn from cutting central office administrators and from its rainy day fund to cover the cost of salaries and benefits for the reinstated teachers. More study by reliable sources is needed before the board can reach a thoughtful conclusion. Here, again, the obvious course is to look outside the district for individuals with the training and experience to lead that effort.\nEvery aspect must be examined.\nBoard members have asked for an academic audit, and that must be accompanied by a fiscal audit to look at how all the streams of money are being used. And then the information must be shared with the control board and state education department.\nIt all goes back to the need for a fresh, outside perspective. Outside eyes should challenge everything that has been done and the culture that has produced such terrible results for Buffalo's school children."}

They could even get paid for watching kids and get training, such as first aid classes, to make their homes into a safe place where children can learn.\nThere\u2019s a severe shortage of day care providers in Weld County. In fact, officials refer to it as a \u201cdesert\u201d here. It\u2019s a problem 30 percent of Coloradans live with. In Weld, there are two children who need care for every licensed spot at a day care center. In June 2016, there were 5,854 licensed child care openings throughout Weld, but an estimated 14,000 children under the age of 5 who needed to be taken care of at some point during the day.\nSo it\u2019s Mendoza\u2019s job to act like a coach recruiting basketball players to help solve that problem. She hopes to get more people, like that teenager, to not only watch her baby but a few other kids and earn some much-needed money to do it.\nThe teen just graduated from high school and plans do to what a lot of other kids her age do: go to college. The only difference is when she\u2019s not in school, she\u2019ll care for her child and her friends\u2019 children. She\u2019ll be trained for it, too, and she can make some extra money because of a partnership with the United Way and the Weld County Department of Human Services.\nThree months in, and a few tears later, Mendoza had her first success story down.\nFor Greeley, the March 2018 statistics showed 9,733 children younger than 5 needed care, but their parents would have to compete for just 2,966 licensed openings.\nMost parents in Weld County \u2014 60 percent \u2014 solve that by asking family, friends and neighbors to take care of their kids during the day.

That\u2019s a double hit many working mothers (and fathers) struggle to solve.\nIt could be that there are too many rules for providers to follow.

The cherished goals of rule of law, transparency, accountability, effectiveness of the state, and the ability of the state to deliver social services are often not achieved according to the de-jure criteria as they are negotiated politically through the citizens\u2019 interaction with the state.\nThe political economy of governance is about patron-client relationships and the politics of patronage. Any program on governance needs to take into account the ground realities of real politik in developing countries.\nThe World Bank came out with Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) in 2010, which include \u2018voice and accountability\u2019, \u2018political stability\u2019, \u2018government effectiveness\u2019, \u2018regulatory quality\u2019, \u2018rule of law\u2019, and \u2018control of corruption\u2019. The Bank has been gathering this data from more than 200 countries since 1996.\nThe World Bank in its 2002 report defines governance as \u201crules, enforcement mechanisms and organizations\u201d. A decade earlier in 1992, the Bank defined it as \u201cthe manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country\u2019s economic and social resources for development\u201d. Governance is the political economy of the state\u2019s interactions with the citizens.\nThe six indicators to measure governance in the Bank\u2019s WGI paper are based on respondents\u2019 perceptions. Voice and accountability deals with the holding of free and fair elections, citizen participation and ensuring various kinds of freedoms such as that of expression and association. It also includes free media. Political stability and absence of terrorism deals with the continuity of the tenure of government.\nGovernment effectiveness focuses on the state\u2019s ability to deliver services. It looks into the standards of the bureaucracy and the degree of autonomy of the civil service from political interference, and ability of the government to deliver essential public services to citizens with credibility and commitment.\nRegulatory quality deals with the World Bank\u2019s notions of making nation-states regulate and monitor the private sector. The purpose is that the government should act as a watchdog rather than pushing development through planned state intervention.\nRule of law in the institutional economics framework deals with property rights and the ability of the state to enforce contracts. Control of corruption looks into the misuse of public office for private gains and the monopolization of state resources by powerful interest groups and factions. It also includes \u201cboth petty and grand forms of corruption\u201d.\nIFIs push the \u2018good governance\u2019 reforms model that is inspired by neo-Weberian thinking. They focus on the implementation of rule of law, sanctity of contract, a level playing field and rule-based governance. The theoretical roots of such rule-based governance go back to \u2018Weberian\u2019 analysis. Weber\u2019s writings have been appropriated (even wrongly) to justify the reforms package that is not compatible with the structural features of the developing countries like Pakistan. Therefore, there is a need to present a more nuanced political economy structural analysis.\nAcemoglu and Robinson in their much acclaimed book \u2018Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty\u2019 (2012) present a limited view of history.

Surprisingly, this process isn't that far off from natural gene expression \u2014 wherein specific inputs cause specific genes to turn on for specific intervals and generate proteins that become the inputs for other genes further down the line.\nThe team has also developed a NOT gate using the same techniques and combined the two bacteria to create a genetic NAND gate.

The biographical sketch from the Press Office notes that he has been a professional journalist since 1979.\nHe also trained as a lawyer, graduating with a degree from the Faculty of Jurisprudence of Rome\u2019s prestigious La Sapienza University \u2014 where he wrote his dissertation on freedom of the press \u2014 before beginning his journalistic career, which has seen him win several awards, including the international Ischia Prize in 2001, for distinguished professional ethical practice.\nThe higher-ups would not likely ever admit it, but their choice of a man with a professional reputation as a straight shooter could suggest they have taken the lessons of the \u201cLettergate\u201d scandal to heart \u2014 or at least, that they want to appear to have taken them to heart.\nRuffini is also a man with an impressive Italian and Vatican pedigree.\nHe is the son of the Italian politician, lawyer, and essayist, Attilio Ruffini, who held several portfolios including foreign minister in the late 1970s under various Christian Democrat governments during that party\u2019s heyday under Giulio Andreotti and Francesco Cossiga.\nPaolo Ruffini\u2019s great uncle was Ernesto Cardinal Ruffini, archbishop of Palermo from 1945 until his death in 1967.\nIn 2014, after decades in Italy\u2019s print and television media establishments, Ruffini took over direction of the Italian bishops\u2019 TV2000 and Radio InBlu networks, where he worked to consolidate mission focus and spearheaded forays into new media.\nAt nearly 62 years of age, with an impressive career behind him, Ruffini does not need the job to pad his resum\u00e9. His conduct in previous positions strongly suggests he is not intent on being either a token or a pushover. During his tumultuous relationship with the Rai 3 network, he felt he was sidelined for political reasons, and in 2010 fought successfully to be given the directorship he formerly held, only to resign his post after winning the legal battle for it.\nRuffini, in other words, is willing not only to stand on principle, but to leave when he does not feel he is getting the institutional support he needs to do the job he came on to do.\nThe general tenor inside the Dicastery for Communication, meanwhile, seems to be one approaching cautious optimism. Sources inside the department say the attitude is \u201cwait and see\u201d with open minds.\nThere are two things Vatican watchers are waiting to see.\nThe first is: will a layman be able to overcome the institutional culture of clerical privilege within the Curia \u2014 in other words \u2014 will Ruffini be able to govern? To put the matter more bluntly: will he be able to put the right people in place, even if it means moving others out, and even when some of those people are clerics?\nThe answer to that will depend almost entirely on the support Ruffini gets from above.\nThe other question is: what is Ruffini\u2019s mandate?

The more bullish one has placed his bet on May 27, 2024.\nA driverless future will happen sooner than 2024, and it won\u2019t happen first in the U.S., Europe or Japan.\nIt will happen first in China.\nChina may not have pole position on autonomous driving technology and development, but it will be the first country where driverless cars go mainstream.\nThe long-standing joke among drivers in Beijing is that China\u2019s capital is one massive parking lot. And it gets even worse during rush hour! Fueled by the country\u2019s economic boom, the number of motorized vehicles has exceeded road space and contributes to nearly 70% of the city\u2019s terrible air pollution. These days, meeting friends, doing business and getting around requires detailed strategic planning.\nThe transport bottleneck affects the quality of life of everyday citizens, the productivity of workers and the efficient movement of goods and services \u2013 resulting in a collective drag on economic growth. The country has more than 14 cities with a population greater than 5 million and more than 100 cities \u2013 compared to 35 in Europe \u2013 with more than 1 million people. By 2025, the number of those cities is expected to grow to 23 and 221, respectively. By 2030, China\u2019s cities are expected to add 350 million people, the entire population of the U.S. Gridlock only stands to get worse.\nThe Chinese government recognizes the problem. It has impressively built out public transport, most notably metro systems and high-speed rails, and has restricted private car use. The private sector recognizes the opportunity. Electric bikes, ride-hailing apps lead by Didi, and bike-sharing services like Mobike and Ofo, have reduced traffic, pollution and fuel consumption.\nBut autonomous vehicles can make an even bigger impact, which is why China has singled out the key sector in their \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program to transform the country. With driverless technology, transport costs could drop 20 cents per mile, reduce car ownership, and transform many modes of transportation, from trucks to construction equipment. It\u2019s also widely recognized that good, cost-effective transportation is a key to alleviating poverty.\nChina is not the only country with transport issues, nor the only one that will benefit. But China has the most at stake, due to its size. The ruling Communist Party knows that more efficient mobility is key to spurring economic growth and quality of life, which are critical to ensuring social stability, which is critical to staying in power.\nThirty years ago, nobody in China owned a private car. In 2009, China became the largest car market in the world. Today, the country has over 300 million vehicles, despite being ranked 74th in vehicles per capita.\nA rapid shift in attitudes has accompanied the increase in consumption. China\u2019s growing middle class has more discretionary spending and is \u201ctrading up\u201d and more aspirational in its purchasing.\nVisitors are shocked to see how China has leapfrogged the West in many areas, particularly in technology.

Russell, the notorious loose cannon who once put George Clooney in a chokehold, sounds humbled and matured as he promotes his new movie, The Fighter.\n\u2022 Mark Wahlberg on \u2018The Fighter\u2019 and More The Fighter details the real-life comeback of champion welterweight \u201cIrish\u201d Micky Ward (Wahlberg). Initially hobbled by his troubled half-brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), a former boxing star-turned-crack addict, and his controlling mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo), Micky finds his strength after he falls for a tough-talking bartender (Amy Adams).\nRussell came to the project late, a replacement for Black Swan\u2019s Darren Aronofsky, who left to make The Wrestler. And it was an uncharacteristic choice for him. Russell\u2019s most inspired work ( Flirting With Disaster comes to mind) skillfully weaves some high-minded levity into relationship dramas. The Fighter, on the other hand, was a sober study of a working-class hero and his hard-scrabble clan from Lowell, Massachusetts.\nBy the time Russell was hired, the production was on its fourth script and its third Dickie Eklund (Matt Damon and Brad Pitt were both initially cast in the role). After Bale joined the film, Wahlberg, who has been friends with Russell since Three Kings, finally asked him to step in and direct.\nIndeed, Russell\u2019s irreverence is evident throughout The Fighter. It works well in Ward\u2019s chorus of big-haired, harpy sisters and their mouthy exchanges with Charlene (Adams), but at times feels too much like a New York intellectual\u2019s take on the working stiffs in the row houses. Early reviews of The Fighter have been mixed, but even Russell\u2019s staunchest critics acknowledge he wrested Oscar-worthy performances out of his ensemble cast.\nSo now, Russell\u2019s career is suddenly making industry headlines, with him reportedly \u201cre-teaming\u201d with Three Kings co-star Ice Cube for a cop drama for New Line Cinema, writing and directing the videogame adaptation of Unchartered: Drake\u2019s Fortune for Sony Pictures, and writing and directing the family drama Old St. Louis starring Vince Vaughn.\nIt\u2019s a major turnaround for the director. Before and during The Fighter, Russell was mired in the political satire Nailed!, a production plagued by financing issues and, in the case of James Caan, some creative differences. Last summer, he finally pulled his name off the film.\nThe Fighter, by comparison, rolled along without major incident. Though there were a few touch-and-go moments. Russell is a yeller, and, as Adams told the Los Angeles Times, this set was no exception to his others in that regard. The difference was that the director had at least one formidable sparring partner: the real Dickie Eklund, who doesn\u2019t generally back down when challenged.\nTo be fair, Russell\u2014even at his least charming\u2014is hardly alone in Hollywood, a town crawling with geniuses that make soul-withering demands for the sake of a vision. Just ask the actors who have worked with The Social Network\u2019s David Fincher, Avatar\u2019s James Cameron, and Oliver Stone, to name a few.\nEven Adams admitted she was grateful for Russell\u2019s goading.

But as the temperature rises, my attention span drops, and suddenly an entire episode of Project Runway is difficult to get through in one sitting.\nFortunately, I came across Angola-born Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa's Independent Foreign Fiction Prize-winning The Book of Chameleons, a perfect read for my heat-addled brain.

In post-civil war Angola, F\u00e9lix has switched from selling books to selling personal histories. His business card reads, \"Give your children a better past.\" He forges family trees and stories of noble ancestry for those whose pasts need hiding or improving.\nThe narrator is Eulalio, a dead man reincarnated as a gecko who lives in F\u00e9lix's apartment and becomes his confidante. \"I think what I do is really an advanced kind of literature,\" Felix tells Eulalio. \"I create plots, I invent characters, but rather than keeping them trapped in a book I give them life, launching them out into reality.\"\nAfter F\u00e9lix invents Jos\u00e9 Buchmann, a war photographer who has recently returned to Angola from exile, Buchmann seems to believe wholly in the lie. He becomes obsessed with tracking down his faux mother and draws F\u00e9lix into his dark pasts, both real and created.\nAt 48, Agualusa has been publishing novels in Portuguese since the late '80s, but The Book of Chameleons is his first work to appear in America. Despite the book's subject matter, it has a charming airiness. Feel free to put it down after every tiny segment. You'll certainly be back to see how it ends.\n\"F\u00e9lix Ventura. Guarantee your children a better past.\" And he laughed. A sad laugh, but not unpleasant. \"That would be you, I presume? A friend of mine gave me your card.\"\nThe foreigner closed the door. He walked around the room, his hands clasped behind his back, pausing for a long moment in front of the beautiful oil portrait of Frederick Douglass. Then he sat down, at last, in one of the armchairs, and with an elegant gesture invited the albino to do the same. It was as though he were the owner of the house. Certain common friends, he said - his voice becoming even gentler - had given him this address.They'd told him of a man who dealt in memories, a man who sold the past, clandestinely, the way other people deal in cocaine. F\u00e9lix looked at him with mistrust. Everything about this strange man annoyed him - his manners that were both gentle and authoritative, his ironic way of speaking, the antiquated moustache. He sat himself down in a grand wickerwork chair, at the opposite end of the room, as though afraid the other man's delicacy might be contagious.\n\"And might I know who you are?\"\n\"But do tell me, my dear man - who are your clients?\""}

{"idx": "22139", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Marketing investments are an integral part of the business for CMOs.\nI like to use a simple shorthand for thinking about go-to-market investments, something I call the three P\u2019s: push, pull and pricing. Push investments are those that grow the channel or distribution. Pull investments literally pull in customers so they\u2019re the ones focused on acquisition and retention of existing customers. Pricing is really anything that has to do with your pricing model, including everyone\u2019s favorite: discounts.\nSo, if those are the buckets that you pour marketing investments into, how do you figure out how much you should be pouring in? This is one of the most elusive questions in marketing. Just ask any CMO why you invest this much or that much in that category of marketing investment.\nIdeally, it\u2019s because they know why a particular investment is going to work based on experience, anecdote or historical data about what works and what doesn\u2019t. At the very least, every marketing dollar should be helping you get smarter about where the next dollar goes.\nEveryone in marketing has to reconcile many opposing forces: the need to build a brand, acquire customers, nurture existing customers, build out and support a sales channel, expand distribution, and optimize pricing and promotion, all at the same time. What makes things even more challenging beyond the pressure of making payroll or earnings per share targets is that marketing investments across all of these forces tend to operate at different levels in the customer experience, require different magnitudes and frequency of investment, offer both variable and fixed investment opportunities and\u2014the real killer\u2014have different financial return scenarios.\nAs you establish interim metrics for each of your marketing investments, you\u2019re actually building out a model of how your business works.\nHow are you supposed to weigh marketing investments across such a wide array of options?\nThe key comes in the form of two important steps: landing on your desired outcome or metric and establishing your primary interim marketing metric for each. What you\u2019re looking to do is to establish a causal connection among your marketing investment, the interim metric and your outcome metric.\nThink about attribution. When you purchase search ads, your interim metric might be actual click-through visits and then seeing via analytics that a certain percentage of those click-through visits convert to revenue. Naturally, these numbers will be averages. What\u2019s important here is that you\u2019re establishing a connection between a level of marketing investment and the achievement of your marketing outcome metric: revenue.\nYou might see that you drive traffic to your site by using a search ad, but a portion of that traffic also subscribes to an automated email campaign that changes the overall frequency of purchase. Instead of trying to divvy up attribution dollars across investments, I\u2019ve found it to be more sensible to focus on the overall customer journey and how different journeys and your insight into them can help you optimize where you want to place your bets.\nAs you establish interim metrics for each of your marketing investments, you\u2019re actually building out a model of how your business works and what kinds of leverage different investments might represent.\nWhile the acquisition metrics are the easiest, the toughest ones to establish are often the most powerful. Let\u2019s take the next category of marketing investment: engagement and retention.

{"idx": "22145", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The U.S. Department of Justice has repealed a policy seen as being lax on antitrust violations, signaling a more aggressive approach toward antitrust enforcement under the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama.\nThe DOJ's Antitrust Division has withdrawn a September report that \"raised too many hurdles to government antitrust enforcement and favored extreme caution\" toward antitrust enforcement action, the DOJ said. The change in policy could mean that the DOJ looks harder at the actions of technology vendors such as Google, Oracle and IBM, as detractors have raised antitrust concerns about all three in recent months.\nChristine Varney, assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust Division, said her comments, made during a speech Monday, weren't directed at any one company. She did say, however, that the DOJ should take close looks at the high-tech and Internet industries and new ways of measuring antitrust activity there. Varney also said the DOJ would look hard at mergers and their impact on competition.\n\"Withdrawing the ... report is a shift in philosophy and the clearest way to let everyone know that the Antitrust Division will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition and harm consumers,\" Varney said during a speech. \"The division will return to tried-and-true case law and Supreme Court precedent in enforcing the antitrust laws.\"\nSpokesmen with Google and Intel declined to comment on the change in policy. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has an open antitrust investigation of Intel and the DOJ's change in policy wouldn't affect that.\nIn recent months, several detractors have raised concerns that Google has a near monopoly in online search advertising. In late 2008, the DOJ's concerns over a proposed advertising partnership between Google and Yahoo killed the deal.\nGoogle recently has been meeting with lawmakers, journalists and others in an effort to explain its positions on business competition. Google's main message has been that competition with the search giant is \"one click away.\"\n\"As Google has grown, the company has naturally faced more scrutiny about our business principles and practices,\" Adam Kovacevich, senior manager for Google's global communications and public affairs, wrote on the Google public policy blog Friday. \"We believe that Google promotes competition and openness online, but we haven't always done a good job telling our story.\"\nAn antitrust expert at Boston University questioned the DOJ's decision. It's no surprise that the Obama administration would take a different approach than former President George Bush's administration, said antitrust expert Professor Keith Hylton.\nVarney talked about cartels and price-fixing and praised the DOJ for working hard on those types of issues. There are a handful of industries where cartels still exist because of \"powerful interest groups,\" and new actions against those industries would be welcome, Hylton said.\nBut in most industries, a more aggressive approach may not be needed, he said. \"Opening up the doors (or opening the doors wider) of the Department of Justice to complaints from firms against their rivals will encourage a different form of interest-group politics,\" he wrote in an e-mail.\nThe change in policy may mean that tech companies will have to look hard at mergers before going through with them, added Bruce McDonald, a lawyer with the Jones Day law firm, and former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ's Antitrust Division. High-tech and other companies may be more reluctant to go through with mergers, even though only a handful"}

Once known as one of Japan\u2019s most beautiful villages, it was given an official order to evacuate.\nOn the afternoon of March 11th\u2014a Friday\u2014the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, on Japan\u2019s Pacific coast, had more than six thousand workers inside. The plant, about a hundred and fifty miles north of Tokyo, is painted white and pale blue and is a labyrinth of boxy buildings and piping on a campus larger than the Pentagon\u2019s. It has six reactors. Yusuke Tataki was in the concrete building that contains Reactor No. 4. He is a tobi worker\u2014a scaffolder\u2014and, at thirty-three, is small and nimble. Like many of the plant\u2019s employees, he grew up nearby. He often skipped classes to surf, and after high school he worked, unhappily, on an assembly line welding circuit boards, until he got into scaffolding, which has kept him employed, on and off, at nuclear plants ever since. \u201cEven when there\u2019s no work elsewhere, there is work at the plants,\u201d he told me recently.\nAt 2:46 P.M. on March 11th, an earthquake began to rattle the building, more violent than any Tataki could remember. It knocked him to the ground, and the lights failed. In darkness, he heard steel crashing against steel and men shouting. The building groaned. Heavy objects fell around him from heights of three or four stories. When the shaking stopped and emergency lights came on, the air was thick with a chalky haze of dust and concrete. Tataki knew that the only way out of the building was through an air lock\u2014a set of parallel doors designed to prevent contamination\u2014but the quake had jammed it shut. The workers around him were disciplined but anxious, and they banged on the door for help. \u201cWe all knew that during a quake everything in there could become contaminated with radiation,\u201d he told me.\nThe quake had erupted beneath the ocean floor two hundred and thirty miles northeast of Tokyo, at a magnitude of 9.0\u2014the strongest ever recorded in Japan. On that day, three of the Fukushima plant\u2019s reactors were down for routine maintenance; the other three shut down automatically, as intended.\nAfter a few minutes, a guard managed to open the jammed door, and Tataki hurried toward the parking lot. He has a wife and two children, and wanted to check on them and on his house. About seven hundred employees remained. \u201cWe had trained for this,\u201d Keiichi Kakuta, a forty-two-year-old father of two, who worked in the public-affairs department, told me. \u201cOf course, the mood was tense, but after someone said the reactors had shut down I saw the plant chief calmly instructing people what to do.\u201d To ride out the aftershocks, Kakuta holed up, with most of the others, in the plant\u2019s radiation-resistant Emergency Crisis Headquarters, situated on a small slope nearby. Japanese authorities had picked up the trail of a tsunami sweeping across the Pacific, but its precise approach was still a mystery.\nIn the imagination, tsunamis are a single towering wave, but often they arrive in a crescendo, which is a cruel fact.

These security breaches are only in the latest in a string of high-profile hacking attacks in 2013; other companies recently hit include The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times.\nIt\u2019s not just household names that are the targets of hackers, however: In a report released by Symantec, the maker of the Norton Anti-Virus software, 36% of the global targeted attacks in the first half of 2012 were directed against small businesses with 250 or fewer employees.\n\u201cNowadays, every company with an Internet connection is a potential victim. Hackers used to focus just on high-value organizations, like financial corporations, but now the tools are so efficient and cheap that hackers can afford to attack anyone and everyone around the clock,\u201d said Dr. Paul Judge, vice president and Chief Research Officer of Barracuda Networks, which offers IT support and data protection services.\n\u201cEven the smallest businesses now have to worry about network security and protection \u2013 when they didn\u2019t have to worry so much only 5 years ago,\u201d he said.\nFOXBusiness.com spoke to four cyber-security experts to create a 5-step plan that will get you safely up and running again in no time if and when your business is compromised by a hacker.\nRob Lee, the Digital Forensics and Instant Response Lead at the SANS Institute (a leading information security training institute), says that identifying whether a hacking attack has occurred is incredibly challenging for most businesses. In fact, Lee referenced findings from cyber-security firm Mandiant that showed that it takes companies an average of 416 days from the initial attack to detect a security breach.\nWarning signs might include machines that are suddenly running slowly or crashing, strange network usage patterns, huge transfers of data to unknown destinations or visits from unfamiliar IP addresses (for instance, visits from Eastern European IP addresses when your business\u2019s customers are all based in Texas).\nThe next step is to figure out how many systems or machines have been affected by the compromise, says Roesch. Unless you have an information or cyber-security expert on staff, this would be a good time to call in a professional consultant, who will be able to identify the type of attack being utilized by the hacker, conduct a network and malware analysis, and figure out which systems and data files have been compromised.\nA security expert will also be able to tell you whether the attack was mass-produced \u2013something an employee might have picked up by browsing a compromised website \u2013 or whether it was a unique, targeted attack, which might suggest that the perpetrator was a competitor of some sort, says Dr. Judge.\nOnce the scope of the compromise has been determined, says Lee, \u201call systems should be pulled offline simultaneously.\u201d While the kneejerk response might be to pull the plug on machines as soon as a compromise has been detected, waiting until a thorough investigation has been conducted will better serve you in figuring out how to protect your system from future attacks.\nA big part of the remediation process is changing your employees\u2019 behavior; Nigam identifies employees as a small business\u2019s weakest security points. \u201cBy quickly clicking into emails from strange senders or accessing infected sites, employees can lead to a security breach,\u201d says Nigam.\nDr. Judge recommends using web app firewalls, which can shield your website from attacks, and web filtering services, which will protect your employees from compromised websites that they might visit on work devices."}
{"idx": "22153", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A UK-based social shopping service called Tribesmart recently had its unveiling, and so far it looks like a serious contender in the market. It\u2019s young, so it doesn\u2019t boast an immeasurably large supply of products to wade through, but the foundation for something reasonably big to occur.\nSocial shopping is a topic we return to with relative frequency here at Mashable. Earlier this month we mentioned a budding service called TurnTo, for example. And one thing that remains among the most necessary elements for a successful startup of this kind is not abundant features, but smart design. Intuitiveness is key. And in that respect, Tribesmart delivers.\nI can\u2019t really emphasize the utility of Tribesmart enough. Take the presentation of the homepage, for instance. Whereas some services might relegate product tags to some region around the bottom half of a page, Tribesmart positions it in the top left of the page. This fits nicely against the main menu and its submenus situated along the top of the window. It invites the user to look around as one would a new store. You might know what you\u2019re searching for at Amazon the moment you arrive, but if you prefer an extra bit of spontaneity, Tribesmart does you that favor.\nYou can do a number of things besides browse products, of course. Write reviews, assemble personal lists to share, maybe. If you bring a group of friends along through the registration process, which takes only seconds to do, or alternatively find new contacts through the service, you can assemble tribes to discuss various things in the consumer realm. That\u2019s where the social side of the equation really kicks in. For things in the land of technology - gadgetry in particular - groupthink is natural. It happens in places like Engadget and Gizmodo. Now Tribesmart, too. There\u2019s even a chat window nestled along the bottom of the page, Facebook-style. However, this one is far less complex, and easy to ignore. If you don\u2019t want to trouble with such a thing, well, you\u2019ll hardly notice its there.\nGetting back to the core shopping and sharing elements, Tribesmart presents users with tools to add to Firefox and Internet Explorer 5, 6, 7, and the 8 beta browser. Which are supremely useful as they allow users to quickly add just about anything one might want to highlight. Like iPods. Or digital cameras. Or summer garden sheds. Yes, sheds. The kind of contraptions that run homeowners thousands of dollars/pounds.\nThe number of users interested in huge and costly products is presumably very small, even taking into account the potential for a great number of registrants to climb aboard Tribesmart in the coming weeks and months. But the choice is yours as to what you add to the Tribesmart product roll, and that\u2019s something to appreciate. Powerful aggregation in an elegant setup is a rarity. Now Web users in the UK can partake in the process."}
{"idx": "22154", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Alejandro Madrigal has published more than 250 scientific papers from the forefront of cancer research. But his last one is different: it's his first novel. Dias de Rabias depicts the philosophical journey of a young doctor fighting for his patient's life, a boy supposedly suffering from rabies, in a small Mexican town riddled by corruption. \"It's a story about the ways you can make a difference by being there,\" says Madrigal, who will be speaking at WIRED Health on April 29. An internationally respected specialist in the fields of stem cell transplantation, histocompatibility and immunogenetics, Madrigal has led innovative research in bone marrow transplantation. And now he's working on a treatment that could dramatically increase the number of people who beat leukaemia.\nIn Spanish, he explains, \"rabias\" both means rabies disease and a state of rage, of being out of control and needing a change. The efforts of the anonymous young doctor, who is also called \"the poet,\" reflect this change. He quotes Octavio Paz: \"The most dangerous communities are the ones who are afraid of making a change.\"\nAlthough fictional, the hero is Madrigal's alter ego: a doctor and a poet, with a fierce passion for medicine and a hope to change lives. \"The only patients I have lost, I have lost them to cancer,\" says Madrigal. The idealist has declared cancer his \"main enemy\" and given himself \"a mission\" to fight it.\nHis talk at WIRED Health, \"How we can all help to cure leukaemia,\" will reflect his trust in what he calls the maximum level of human altruism: our capacity of giving to save a life by becoming a donor. The focus of his latest research is how genetically selected cells could soon eliminate tumours without transplantation.\nJust like his younger, fictional avatar, Alejandro Madrigal is from Mexico. Born in Mexico City in November 1953, he studied medicine at Mexico's Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma before specialising in immunology and cancer. His university and research credentials include Harvard, University College London, Oxford and Stanford. Since 1993, he has been working as scientific director for the Anthony Nolan Research Institute, a UK charity for patients with leukaemia who need a bone marrow transplantation.\nResearch to cure leukaemia has advanced a lot since he started studying medicine, he says, but bone marrow transplantation, or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is still the only treatment that can cure leukaemia. And it's not without risks: from inflammation to graft-to-host disease, only 60 per cent of patients who have been transplanted survive. \"We should increase it to 90 or 100 percent,\" he says. \"So I am working to develop genetic strategies to optimise the donor selection.\" Matching the good donor with the patient helps to improve the outcome of the transplantation substantially, says Madrigal.\nMadrigal's current research, the EU-funded T-control project, focuses on \"educating\" cord blood cells to fight cancer cells, by selecting the cells that can control inflammation and prevent graft-to-host disease. \"In a cord blood unit, some cells, called regulatory T-cells, control the hyper reaction of the other cells and insure the proper balancing of body,\" he explains. \"We isolate them to give them to the patient who lack them.\" Madrig"}

Stewart, who has worked extensively on exploring the relationship between Gaelic song and piping, has been around the leading musicians in the Gaidhealtachd often enough over the years to know how well a melody is going to sit on the instruments she's chosen to accompany her as she relates The Highland Wedding, from the opening song that foretells of the great and the good's attendance at our young hero's nuptials through courtship, the bedding of the bride and on to A Bhanais Taigh (the house wedding), which traditionally took place in the groom's house and sometimes went on for days.\n\"The idea for the commission's subject was mine,\" says Stewart who is currently musician in residence at Sabhal Mor Ostaig, the Gaelic college on Skye. \"I felt I was becoming known almost exclusively for heavy Gaelic song projects dealing in subjects like emigration, the Jacobite era and the Clearances, and I wanted to show that I can sing happy songs, too. Mind you, we're only going as far as the house wedding; we can leave the divorce for another time.\"\nWith a vast personal store of songs, she didn't have to do too much research to find suitable material to follow her narrative through. With one or two stages in the relationship's development, such as Suirghe (the courting) and A' Reiteach (the engagement celebrations), no obvious candidates sprang to mind, so Stewart composed her own melodies to fit old texts or a set of dance tunes for her band to play. For the bedding of the bride she has even directed a video for inclusion in the presentation as well as composing a new tune. \"The cheek of me,\" she laughs self-mockingly.\nFor the wedding band she chose Ingrid Henderson (clarsach), Iain MacFarlane (fiddle and melodeon) and Allan Henderson (fiddle and piano) alongside piper Angus Nicolson, all first-rate musicians with whom she has worked before. More importantly, perhaps, however, is the fact that all four have the Gaelic.\n\"It makes things so much easier if they know the language,\" says Stewart. \"They understand that I don't want to alter the lyrics to suit the music. It might just be one word that seems like an awkward fit rhythmically or something, but when I sing to them they get the meaning right"}

The theme for this year\u2019s summit is SADC Strategy for Economic Transformation: Leveraging the Region\u2019s Diverse Resources for Sustainable Economic and Social Development through Beneficiation and Value Addition.\nValue addition and beneficiation is the fourth cluster of Zim Asset, an ambitious five-year development plan that requires $27-billion (R286-billion) to implement. The programme seeks to achieve sustainable development and social equity anchored on indigenisation, empowerment and employment creation propelled by the exploitation of human and natural resources.\nAlthough Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, who is the chairperson of the SADC council of ministers, said the theme was developed collectively by the region, SADC executive secretary Dr Stergomena Lawrence Tax confirmed that Zimbabwe had come up with the theme.\nShe thanked Zimbabwe for coming up with a relevant theme.\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs Ambassador Joey Bimha also confirmed that Zimbabwe had developed the theme, which he said was in line with the SADC development goals.\n\u201cYou choose an element of the SADC development agenda and that is what Zimbabwe did,\u201d he told local newspaper The Standard.\nMumbengegwi justified the theme at a press conference on the outcome of the SADC council of ministers meeting held on Saturday, saying it was carefully selected and relevant to the entire region.\n\u201cThe theme was carefully selected in close consultations with the secretariat in line with their expertise and expectations,\u201d said Mumbengegwi.\nHe cited the example of Zimbabwean tobacco, which he said is getting only 10% of its value whereas Zimbabwe would benefit tenfold if value was added.\nSome critics, including former SADC executive secretary Dr Simba Makoni, have castigated Mugabe and the Zimbabwean government for imprinting Zanu-PF values on the theme of the summit. Makoni headed the SADC secretariat between 1984 and 1994.\nHe said that during his tenure, SADC themes were not determined by the incoming chairperson and their year in office, but were drawn from a broad strategy of the organisation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even believe this theme we are giving to this summit is the consensual theme of the collective; this is a unilateral decision, because we have a particular message we want to convey particularly to the international community and our regional peers that the battlefront is on natural resources, is on resource sovereignty, is on resource nationalism,\u201d said Makoni.\nMumbengegwi said that as a way to ensure local beneficiation and value addition in the mining sector, Zimbabwe had come up with a law that stipulates 51% of shares should be in the hands of indigenous persons.

Canada and the United States are currently the top producers and major global exporters of whole yellow pea. However, the recent spurt in demand for plant protein in the United States, Western Europe and China will alter the global production and trade flow of whole yellow pea.\nRecent analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Whole Yellow Peas and Pea Protein Ingredients: A Close Supply and Value Chain Relationship (http://www.frost.com/nf42), finds that the global production in 2014 amounted to 9 million metric tons, valued at $3.05 billion. The same year, the value-added dry pea protein market was worth $29.9 million and its sales touched 20.7 thousand metric tons.\nThe year to year production of whole yellow peas can vary greatly based on the weather, planting times, supply, demand, forecast price and performance of other commodity products. Its production growth rates have been largely stable at commodity levels of 2 percent to 4 percent. In contrast, the revenues of dry pea protein ingredients are expected to grow at around 10 percent annually.\n\"While the soaring demand for pea protein ingredients could threaten the producers of whole yellow peas, it could also present them with several opportunities,\" said Frost & Sullivan Chemicals, Materials & Food Research Analyst Reuben Sequeira.\nThe emergence of pea protein as a value-added product from a traditionally direct consumption market will considerably enhance the growth prospects of pea processors and food manufacturers in North America and China. They will have to find the adequate balance between operating in this market and catering to the direct consumption or pea flour and starch markets.\nFrom a global standpoint, both whole yellow pea processing and pea protein ingredient manufacturing have large markets in the United States, China, India, Ukraine, Russia and Canada. While the United States is a top-rung producer and exporter of yellow peas, China is a major importer of yellow peas, and like the United States, is experiencing high growth in the demand for pea proteins.\n\"Once companies acknowledge the swelling demand for clean pea protein, companies in China and the United States will be in a race to set up processing plants to serve consumers close to home,\" observed Sequeira. \"It is also likely to affect the production and import-export balances of these two countries.\"\nWhole Yellow Peas and Pea Protein Ingredients: A Close Supply and Value Chain Relationship is part of the Food and Agriculture (http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/chemicals-materials-food-ppe/food-agriculture) Growth Partnership Service program.

{"idx": "22168", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Without any warning came the proclamation that the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was shutting down its New York City operations. The argument made was that the expenses incurred by PIA on flying to New York did not make financial sense to the company anymore. Five weekly flights would fly to New York and three other American cities but PIA is now considering surrendering the route altogether. With a significant population of expatriates living in the United States, this decision predictably evoked great hue and cry.\nOn November 22, 2017, PIA Chairman Irfan Elahi appeared before the National Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs to make the claim that, last year, the airline incurred losses of 1.5 billion rupees from its New York operations. He argued that the airline had been saddled with such losses for the past 10-12 years.\nWhen approached, PIA spokesman Mashood Tajwar explained that the route to New York involved a stopover in Manchester. This means that the cost to fly to New York also included airport and cargo handling charges incurred in Manchester. Negating the notion of surrendering the New York route, he termed it the suspension of New York operations.\nNotwithstanding the operational details, if PIA\u2019s official version is indeed considered, it begs the question: why can\u2019t New York operation be merged with Toronto operations, given that PIA flies non-stop to Toronto.\nThe additional costs incurred in Manchester are a valid concern, even though the stopover in Manchester is primarily for security checks. Passengers cannot disembark at the airport while the number of new passengers from London to New York is also not significant.\nMeanwhile, when costs are compared between the New York route and the Toronto route, there is great similarity in the finances expended. The fuel cost is almost the same as is the crew cost (cockpit crew and cabin crew). Costs for landing an aircraft, parking and housing it are the same, and the turnaround costs (time during which the aircraft must remain parked at the gate) are also the same. Some insiders question why one route is considered profitable while the other has been shut down.\nNotwithstanding the operational details, if PIA\u2019s official version is indeed considered, it begs the question: why can\u2019t New York operation be merged with Toronto operations, given that PIA flies non-stop to Toronto. Official word is that Toronto itself is a profit-making route and therefore cannot be saddled with the burden of passengers heading to New York.\nOn the surface, the logic is sound. But scratch the surface, and the money involved becomes more apparent.\nIndeed New York is a hub that connects various flights with different destinations, some not even in the United States. Routes are not just obtained for a substantial sum of money; their approval is contingent on factors such as power connections and diplomatic relations. And once surrendered, they cannot be re-obtained within a matter of days or months.\nIn the case of New York, a route surrendered means that flight operations have been given up for good since there are a limited number of slots available. Etihad Airways, for example, is a recent phenomenon. And when they applied to the John F Kennedy Airport for a slot, they were turned down simply because the Americans had no space to accommodate another airline.\nBut PIA can also surrender the route in favour of another airline. Word from the inside is that this route is being surrendered to Etihad Airways, although Tajwar denies such an eventuality."}

Remember the assassin-on-the-boat cinematic from the previous title? We sure do.

A 2012 Forrester global information worker study found 12 percent using tablets, and 8 percent had paid for them themselves.\nKen Dulaney, a vice president and Distinguished Analyst at Gartner, told eWEEK that the iPad, when it was introduced, helped to further the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trend because it was cool and beautiful and workers wanted to use it.\n\"But IT couldn't figure out a reason that a knowledge worker needed a tablet,\" he said.\n\"For some, an iPad and a keyboard can be a substitute for a notebook, but this can never be on a permanent basis because most content in organizations is created with the Office suite, and those applications do not run in full on iPads,\" Dulaney explained. \"The potential for errors, when using such a solution, is not a huge variable, but business people cannot afford to look at a spreadsheet on an iPad and wonder if something is missing.\"\nGartner's stance, he added, is that the iPad is not a laptop replacement.

The supporting cast also slotted into the well programmed and finely tuned line up with Nic himself performing various stages throughout. Also new for 2016 was the Kent County Showground site, allowing for more space than the previous venues whilst providing a safe and friendly campsite just walking distance from the arenas.\nThe show ground was slightly off the beaten track in Maidstone surrounded by woodlands and greenery offering up a picturesque setting for attendees. There were 3 key stages throughout the weekend, The Meadow - an indoor arena housing a euphoric Ibizan style stage, The Barn - a slightly smaller indoor venue and The Stables - a picturesque intimate outdoor arena.

Playing B2B after a six year hiatus, the British legends collided with an effortless set whipping the crowd into a frenzy. Hints of trance creeping in to their classic progressive mix, the crowd were in the palm of their hand throughout. The pair's long awaited performance marks the beginning of their eagerly anticipated upcoming reunion tour coming soon.\nDay two was a busier affair from start to finish with nearly 20,000 flocking to witness the star studded line up. From 12pm each arena was rammed. Running Back head honcho slotted in perfectly at the start with a disco enfused set, Jasper James joined him to warm The Stables arena. Mind Against and Bicep rounded off the outdoor vibes with some bass heavy old school cuts. Jasper dropping the tech house classic 'Spanish Fly' for one of the largest cheers of the weekend.\nThe legendary figure of Carl Cox, who is set to round off his Ibiza legacy this summer, then joined forces with Mr Fanciullis for a tripped out techno set reminiscent of early rave outings of the 90s and the crowd already at fever pitch went wild.

A New York Times column last week credited Senate committee chairman Johnny Isaakson and Tester, the ranking minority member, for a partnership that has yielded good legislation for veterans services, including speeding confirmation of the new VA secretary, passage of a temporary fix for the flawed Veterans Choice Program and an accountability measure that aims to protect whistle blowers, expedite the filling of director vacancies and allow the firing of bad employees.\nEvasive IHS. When the man in charge of Indian Health Service testified to a Senate appropriations committee last week, he managed to spark bipartisan fury by failing to answer direct questions about the budget proposed for an agency that is supposed to deliver health care to 2.2 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives.

Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children are \u201cstill dying of measles\u201d in the country where the earliest vaccines were pioneered. Mister Philippe referenced the legendary biologist Louis Pasteur, who worked on one of the world\u2019s first vaccines in the 19th century.\nCare to wager when the measles vaccine was introduced? Data: WHO.\nAt the moment, three vaccines are mandatory in France: for diphtheria, tetanus, and polio. However, the recommendations of international medical bodies (including the World Health Organization) include several other vaccines, including measles. In Europe and the US, measles outbreaks have grown increasingly threatening. In Romania\u2019s unvaccinated community, there have already been 500 cases and at least 17 fatalities. Italy has also reported an outbreak, just as vaccination rates started to fall off. Across the ocean, the American state of Maine reported its first case of measles in over 20 years \u2014 and all this is directly correlated to a reduction in vaccination.\nFrench authorities have realized what scientists have been screaming for years: it\u2019s pointless to have so many people suffer and even be killed at the hands of diseases for which we have a silver bullet.\nThe measles vaccine is extremely effective. Researchers estimate that just since 2000, it has saved over 20,000,000 lives worldwide. It\u2019s not even like measles is an isolated case. Just look at polio \u2014 polio cases have dropped by over 99% since vaccines have been introduced, but with vaccination rates dropping, these risks can re-emerge. Instead of executing our coup de grace and completely eradicating these diseases, we\u2019re offering them another chance. This is exactly what Philippe said to motivate this decision \u2014 we can\u2019t afford to allow dangerous infectious diseases to reappear by not vaccinating.\n\u201cWe have the same problem with meningitis. It\u2019s not acceptable that a 15-year-old teenager could die just because they have not been vaccinated,\u201d the minister said.\nThe move also follows a petition signed by 200 senior doctors and hospital bosses, pleading for officials to take measures to prevent such diseases from taking their toll. It\u2019s more than just a personal decision, it\u2019s a collective responsibility.\n\u201cVaccination isn\u2019t only a personal choice that solely benefits the person who is vaccinated\u201d but \u201cit aims to protect the population, in particular children, the elderly and fragile,\u201d wrote the health professionals.\nThe eight more vaccines that will be introduced are for whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitus B, influenza, pneumonia and meningitis C.\nThe baffling trend of anti-vaccination (anti-vaxxing) has turned into a menace. It\u2019s become somewhat fashionable to refuse vaccination, completely ignoring a big chunk of modern medicine and going against everything science (and common sense) says. Why would people shun such a useful tool, a tool that has kept some of the world\u2019s most dangerous diseases at bay?\nIt\u2019s hard to say, though ignorance and exposure to misleading propaganda definitely play a role.

The 23 year-old FSU student was killed during what was supposed to be a controlled sting operation.\n\ufffdThe internal affair report identified several areas of defiance. Places were we didn\ufffdt follow policies,\ufffd said TPD PIO David McCranie.\nThe fired officer was Rachel\ufffds main contact. The report says he knew the sting operation was in jeopardy. Rachel had met with the suspects without police supervision prior to the sting and told a friend of the two suspects she was working undercover. Hoffman family Attorney Lance Block says Rachel\ufffds death is the direct result of sloppy police work.\n\ufffdThere\ufffds just so many series of negligent acts. It\ufffds like a string of dominos falling, one negligent act after another,\ufffd Block said.\nBlock said the internal report will pale in gruesome comparison to a report set to be released by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement later their year. A judge has sealed that report.\nThe Attorney General\ufffds Office conducted its own report on the Hoffman case. The AG\ufffds office found more than 30 possible policy violations on the part of Tallahassee police.\nThe five Tallahassee Police Officers facing disciplinary charges in the Rachel Hoffman case may appeal the charges. The Florida Police Benevolence Association is reviewing the officer\ufffds options. PBA General Council Hal Johnson said the police officers are still waiting on written documentation of their charges.\n\ufffdThese officers have 15 days to file an appeal of their disciplinary actions and that is under consideration right at this time. As I said, we\ufffdre waiting to get the written documentation,\ufffd said Johnson.\nOne of the officers was fired as a result of the botched drug sting. Four were suspended without pay."}

A police SWAT officer killed Garza about an hour after the shooting began.\nGarza spent four years in the Army, receiving his discharge in 2014, according to Pentagon records released Tuesday. During that time, he served two tours in Afghanistan, the first from December 2009 to November 2010 and the second from December 2012 to August 2013.

I don't know how you can go through what he went through and see what he saw and not have it change you or have it affect you.\"\nSix people were wounded, including two police officers and some people who were driving through the area. Patrol cars were riddled with bullets and a police helicopter was hit by at least five shots.\nPolice haven't publicly identified Garza as the gunman, leaving that to the medical examiner's office, which hadn't done so as of midday Tuesday and hadn't responded to phone or email messages seeking that information. Police said they would release additional details at a news conference later Tuesday.\nGarza's family told Houston television station KPRC that something snapped in him following the two tours in Afghanistan and that his condition worsened in the weeks before he traveled to Houston to visit an Army friend.\n\"Just in the last two weeks it progressively got worse,\" said his father, Dionisio Garza. \"It was not the same boy that we raised. Not the loving uncle, the loving brother.\n\"Something snapped. It wasn't him anymore. I'm not making excuses. No excuses. I know he did this, but it wasn't him anymore. My son was broken.\""}

Was it the typographical precision?\nBecause we have the best product. Quark has 90 per cent of the share in publishing and that\u2019s reasonable (laugh). Reliability, ease of use and a very strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed, and the extensions. I have people coming to me and saying that when they use the competitor\u2019s products, they spend double the time. And time is quite valuable.\nI think that it is because we have spent tremendous amount of time and energy trying to understand what makes a customer happy when he uses it. You are correct also that we have tremendous precision. We supported very strong typographical features way earlier than anybody else. It is not just the features, it feels better.\nHow did you all come up with the idea of having something like Quark?\nThe company was started by a partner of mine (Tim Gill, see box), who is no longer a shareholder He came from the computer side and I came from the computer and publishing background. When we got involved, both of us wanted to democratise publishing. In those days, because of the expensive cost of pre-press processes, very few people could publish. It took millions of dollars to start a publication.\nWe thought that it would be a good contribution to the world if we provided tools so that people with modest means could publish. So we used our skills as engineers and when we shipped QuarkXPress 1.0 there were only eight of us. Five were engineers and the rest administrative, accounting staff, etc. It took us nine months to ship QuarkXPress 1.0. It was a labour of love.\nSoftware engineer Tim Gill founded Quark in 1981, producing the first word processor for the Apple II computer. Gill named the company Quark after the subatomic particle proposed as a building block for all matter.\nFred Ebrahimi, Quark\u2019s president and CEO, came on board in 1986. A year later the company released QuarkXPress 1.0, sparking a publishing revolution. During the next few years, Quark focused on perfecting the features, such as typography, hyphenation, multilanguage capabilities, and professional output features that have made QuarkXPress the most popular publishing software among designers, publishers and printers around the world. By the early 1990s, QuarkXPress had solidified its position as the industry leader in the electronic publishing market.\nWe started in June,1986 and we shipped in March, 1987.\nBy that time you had other products for desktop publishing?\nNot desktop publishing, but word processing. We had a product called Word Juggler for Apple II.\nPage Maker was, however, there.\nYes. Page Maker had an extensive market share. There were 50 other products, including Ready Set Go. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t have any competition.\nYou did well till QuarkXPress 4, which did not quite turn out to be as it was expected.\nWe made a mistake with Quark 4.0. I have apologised publicly. We didn\u2019t test it enough. We had great new features. What we didn\u2019t do is test it as strongly as we should have and Quark 4.1, subsequently, solved those problems and we have made a commitment that Quark 5.0 will not ship till our customers say \"ship.\"\nWhat is the direction that 5.0 will be going in?\nWell, the most significant issue of 5.0 is we are producing a tool that would"}

Developers CCP have now confirmed that the game will definitely be free to download and play.\nPreviously, there were plans to introduce a cover charge since the game won\u2019t be coming on disc and will release on the PlayStation Network instead later this year. That cover charge was thought to be around $10 to $20, but CCP has now confirmed that they have scrapped the idea \u2013 much to our delight.\nLike Eve Online though, DUST 514 will still be supported by micro transactions. EVE Online players will be familiar with purchasing ISK for in-game transactions, but we can also tell you that ISK won\u2019t be compatible with DUST 514 purchases. This is because the upcoming PS3 shooter will use a different currency instead, known as Aurum and will be available in $10 \u2013 $100 quantities.\nThere\u2019s another little gem which we uncovered from executive producer Brandon Laurino in a recent interview with Eurogamer \u2013 DUST 514 will feature THOUSANDS of maps and they will be accessible to all players from the start as long as they can discover them.\nFor those of you who are worried about the paid element towards the game, CCP has also stated that items won\u2019t give paid players an unfair advantage over those that choose to play the game without paying. It also looks like those paid items can be earned in the game after a period of time, which is always a great option to have.\nAs previously stated by CCP, there will also be a PS Vita version on the way as well and we now have some additional information for you. The Vita version of DUST 514 will come in the form of an app, which will allow you to set up various aspects of your character and make transactions on the go while you are not on the PS3. These are only basic features we understand, with more cross-platform features to be announced prior to release.\nWe\u2019ve always felt that since DUST 514 was announced, it could well end up being Sony\u2019s secret weapon this year on the PS3. Now that the game is going free to play, CCP has probably put themselves in the bracket for one of the games of 2012. They could have easily put that $20 cover charge for the PSN download if they wanted to and people would have still bought it, especially those with EVE Online experience. So well done to them for making this decision which is sure to go down well with PS3 owners.\nAre you interested in playing DUST 514?

Just one error though: EVE Online is a subscription-based game, not a free-to-play with micro-transactions.

But for public companies and investors who follow their recommendations, new research suggests the advice may not be as useful as the advisors\u2019 reputation might suggest.\nSuch is the prestige of the modern shareholder activist. For Mr. Ackman and his ilk, it has been a long crawl from the dark corners of Wall Street to the warm glow of popularity. Once reviled as a threat to the status quo in executive suites and clubby corporate boardrooms, activist hedge funds are today lauded as catalysts for change, gaining clout and board seats in blue-chip companies: Canadian Pacific Railway, Microsoft Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co.\nVeteran activist investor Carl Icahn, 78, and more recently others such as Daniel S.

Like the leveraged-buyout kings of the 1980s and 1990s immortalized as \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d hedge-fund activists are the new breed of corporate crusaders shaking up lethargic companies, and overhauling the way businesses operate in the name of unlocking value for shareholders.

Activities such as physical fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer are routinely utilized for the goal of enhancing human capacities. This entry is not concerned with every activity and intervention that might improve people\u2019s embodied lives. The focus of this entry is a cluster of debates in practical ethics that is conventionally labeled as \u201cthe ethics of human enhancement\u201d. These debates include clinicians\u2019 concerns about the limits of legitimate health care, parents\u2019 worries about their reproductive and rearing obligations, and the efforts of competitive institutions like sports to combat cheating, as well as more general questions about distributive justice, science policy, and the public regulation of medical technologies.\nAs usual in practical ethics, an adequate discussion of any specific debate under this heading quickly requires orientation to the science underlying particular enhancement interventions and an appreciation of the social and political contexts in which it unfolds. At each turn in these discussions, wide vistas of background philosophical topics also appear for exploration. Rather than providing a detailed account of this whole landscape, this entry hikes a narrow ridge between the different dimensions of the topic, pointing out the side trails but not following them into their respective thickets. Instead, it traces a path of core concerns that winds through all the current debates on the ethics of human enhancement, as guide for those interested in exploring further. To look ahead, our claim is that three sets of philosophical considerations are key to navigating this literature: first, conceptual concerns about the limits of legitimate health care, then moral worries about fairness, authenticity and human nature, and finally political questions about governance and policy.\n2. What are the Proper Limits of Health Care?\n3. Is it Cheating to Use Enhancements?\n4. Do Enhancements Compromise Authenticity?\nAs our preface suggests, the ordinary use of the phrase \u201chuman enhancement\u201d covers a wide range of practices, most of which are not explored in the enhancement ethics literature. To orient our tour, both \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cenhancement\u201d merit some initial clarification, even before we pursue the ways they are interpreted and debated in the literature. For example, as section 2.3 below shows, equivocations between biological and evaluative senses of the term \u201chuman\u201d are rich sources of many superficial disagreements in these debates. Is there anything special about being a member of the biological species homo sapiens that enhancements could threaten, or are those who criticize enhancement as \u201cdehumanizing\u201d really thinking about the loss of other markers of the moral status we confer on persons? To look ahead, we think it will become clear in the sections below that the ethical issues at the heart of the debate about human enhancement are not about policing the biological boundaries of the species homo sapiens. At this point, however, it is enough to note that we are foreclosing neither sense of \u201chuman\u201d from the start, but will stay alert to both until it becomes important to distinguish and relate them.\nWith \u201cenhancement\u201d, on the other hand, it is helpful to specify a working definition from the start. We understand the practices that are being debated in the enhancement ethics literature to be biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form or functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health. This broad definition flows from and reflects the foundational literature in this area (Parens 1998), but it also has several implications that are sometimes forgotten.\nFirst, it means that simple line-drawing exercises aimed at isolating \u201cenhancement technologies\u201d from other biomedical inter"}

He has popped into meetings occasionally. That's all stuff we haven't talked about.\"\nJackson and Hornacek are together in Chicago for the NBA combine so that should be something they discuss, as well as the team president's suggestion that Hornacek didn't control the locker room when he said, \"there was some disconnect at times with this team and I think there is some rebelliousness in this team that created some of the discord.\"\nJackson acknowledged the difficulties of trying to instill his philosophies and culture from a front-office position.

These findings now suggest that the lower limit fortotal water on the moon could be 100 times greater.\n\"When the rocks were first returned from the Apollomissions, it was pretty obvious that they were really dry,\" FrancisMcCubbin, lead author of the study, told SPACE.com. \"A lot of peopleattributed the dry nature to something fundamental about how the moon formed. Ithink an estimate was thrown out there of less than 1 part per billion (ppb)water, because the presumption was that there was almost no water on themoon.\"\nIn 2008, research of volcanic glassbeads brought attention to the fact that there might be more water in themoon's interior than scientists had previously thought. At the time, McCubbinand his colleagues were searching for water in lunar minerals, but at thatpoint they had only models and calculations that suggested higher watercontent.\nSince then, observations from unmanned probes from NASA andother space agencies have confirmed the presence of water in lunar material andwater ice on the moon's surface.\nFor this new study, the researchers were able to compare theircalculations to analyses of samples of Apollomoon rocks and a lunar meteorite from Africa.\n\"We combined the measurements with models thatcharacterize how the material crystallized as the moon cooled,\" McCubbinsaid. \"We found that the minimum watercontent ranged from 64 parts per billion to 5 parts per million ? at leasttwo orders of magnitude greater than previous results.\"\nThe research will appear in the online early edition of theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on June 14.\nIn the new study, researchers located grains of the mineralapatite in thin sections from the moon rocks and meteorite. They used atechnique called secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), which allowed them toanalyze the grains for a compound known as hydroxyl, which can be incorporatedinto apatite's chemical structure if the mineral crystallizes from magma thatcontains water.\nThe SIMS technique bombards the lunar samples with a primaryion beam that allows the researchers to separate the ions with a magnet,depending on the charge.

And intuitively that sounds like it makes sense. But what we're finding is that you really do need to work hard at all levels.\"\nBy emphasizing both \"rigor and relationships,\" said Ms. Sanford, Rhode Island's efforts reflect a growing consensus about what's needed to improve high schools. A long-standing concern is that high schools have grown so large\u2014both in their enrollments and in the number of courses they offer\u2014 that they've become academically and socially fragmented.\nThe new state policies require each district to draft its own \"personalization plan\" for its high schools to \"ensure a collective responsibility for individual students.\"\nAmong the options offered in the regulations: dividing schools into smaller, self-contained units, \"advisories\" in which educators are assigned students to counsel through their high school years, and opportunities for students in the same grade to do interdisciplinary work together.\n\"We want to be certain that no student goes through our high schools unknown,\" said James A.

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is planning to request information about Daraprim's \"astronomical price increase\" from drug's new owner, Turing Pharmaceuticals. Cummings has been conducting an investigation of recent drug price increases.\nSanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said that if Clinton wins the White House, \"I would say\" that drug prices will take a hit.\n\"The entire argument that the government will begin to behave [as controller of prescription prices] is something the drug industry has been fighting tooth and nail,\" Gal said. \"If that actually becomes a policy and looks like it's coming to a chance of passing you'll see drug company valuations cut 20 percent across the board.\"\nBefore Clinton tweeted her reaction to the news about Daraprim, Dr. Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute said that a New York Times story about the drug's price hike comes a time where there already was \"a lot of negative sentiment\" about drug prices, and that \"the industry is vulnerable\" to those public feelings.\nEarlier this month, the Kaiser Family Foundation said a survey had found that 72 percent of the public considered drug prices unreasonable. And Clinton's leading challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has already introduced a plan to deal with drug prices, which includes allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and allowing people to import drugs from Canada, where medication is less expensive.\nGottlieb said \"anecdotes like\" the huge price increase of Daraprim \"hurt and can help drive bad legislation, and Clinton is sure to propose a basket of Obamacare 'fixes' this week that will include populist calls for drug price controls.\"\n\"The problem is that there is more anti-industry populism on both sides of the political divide now. I still don't think the votes are there to get anything through the House [of Representative] but the industry is very vulnerable to things like Medicaid 'best price,' \" Gottlieb said. Medicaid's best price program is a rebate scheme that helps lower federal and state costs for covering prescription drug purchases for Medicaid enrollees.\n\"Ultimately anything that would extend drug price controls would have to come as a pay for on broader legislation that gave Republicans something in return.

One of the men immediately opened fire on the two officers, striking the nine-year police veteran in the head and wounding Cavazos, who was able to pull his partner from the line of fire and shoot back.\nMoreno died the following morning at a local hospital.\nThe suspect killed himself in a downtown San Antonio street near a community college. The other man is in police custody.\nAt the Friday morning funeral service, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg called Moreno an everyday hero who committed his life to protecting the city.\nA San Antonio native who ranked sixth in his 2002 high school class, where he played football as a lineman, Moreno went on to graduate from the University of Texas at Austin before spending nine years on the San Antonio Police force.\nTexas Gov.

However, the report listed none of the sort.\nStair-enclosure doors on the second and third floors must be replaced.\nThe fire alarm system needed repairing because it indicated a \u201ctrouble\u201d signal, which means something is wrong with a single alarm and it needs examining.

Paul To Run For Re-Election And President The plan would let Paul run for president and re-election to his Senate seat at the same time without violating state law that bans candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election.\nThe Kentucky Republican Party has agreed to hold a presidential caucus for Rand Paul \u2014 but only if he shows them the money.\nThe party's executive committee approved a proposal on Saturday to hold a presidential caucus on March 5. The plan would let Paul run for president and re-election to his Senate seat at the same time without violating state law that bans candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election.\nBut the caucus could cost as much as $500,000, and the Republican Party has less than $170,000 in cash on hand according to its latest disclosure report. In a letter to party officials earlier this week, Paul claimed to have transferred $250,000 to the Republican Party to cover the cost of the caucus. But that turned out not to be true, angering some Republicans and jeopardizing Paul's support.\nSaturday, after a more than four hour meeting that began with a prayer to God for wisdom and \"that your will be done here today,\" Republicans agreed to approve the caucus on one condition: The state party had to have $250,000 in its bank account by Sept. 18 specifically reserved for caucus expenses. If the money is not there by the deadline, the caucus would be canceled and Kentucky would have its regularly scheduled primary.\nPaul told reporters after the vote he was relieved, adding that getting the required two-thirds majority to approve the caucus was not easy.\n\"I think it is about something above and beyond one person. It really is about trying to grow the party and I'm thoroughly convinced that were I not in this race that this is just good for the Republican party,\" he said.\nPaul said his most preferred method of raising the money would be to direct people that have already donated the maximum amount to his presidential campaign to donate to the state Republican party. But he said he would do whatever it takes to make it work.\nState law bans candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election. Paul tried without success to convince the state legislature to change the law. A presidential caucus allows voters to vote for Paul for president on March 5 and then vote for him again for re-election to his Senate seat during the primary election on May 17.\nSaturday's vote passed 111-36, avoiding a potential embarrassment to Paul's presidential campaign. His plan, had the caucus failed, would have been to run for re-election to his Senate seat in Kentucky while running for president in the other 49 states.\nMost committee members said their vote was motivated not by Paul's candidacy, but by a desire to make Kentucky a player in presidential politics. That's why Republicans crafted the caucus to appeal to as many of the 17 declared Republican candidates as possible. The plan calls for Kentucky's delegates to be split proportionally rather than \"winner takes all,\" and candidates only need to get 5 percent of the vote to qualify for delegates. That's a threshold much lower than other primary states.\n\"This is not about Sen. Paul in my mind. This is about making Kentucky relevant,\" committee member Troy Sheldon said. \"I think it's the best thing for voters.\"\nDemocratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan"}

Rob Portman after a Republican policy luncheon on March 20.\nJuly 18, 2018, 8 p.m.\nThe U.S. affront to key NATO allies isn\u2019t subsiding in the wake of President Trump\u2019s controversial trip to Europe. In fact, it\u2019s just kicking off in the halls of Congress.\nSenate Republican leaders are spearheading a sanctions package to punish European developers of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline\u2014just as Trump is backing down from his criticism of the project. The package, led by staunch Trump supporter Sen. John Barrasso, would slap mandatory sanctions on two German companies, as well as energy behemoths based in Austria, France, and the Netherlands.\nThat approach is not helping to back up recent congressional moves to affirm support for North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, according to European experts. And it may strain both internal divisions in NATO and the broader, already-embattled transatlantic alliance.\nThe Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is scheduled to start operating next year, would transport natural gas from the Russian Yamal and Nadym-Pur-Taz fields to Greifswald, a German port city on the Baltic Sea. That route is 1,300 miles shorter than the current pipeline, which snakes through Ukraine, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic before reaching Germany.\nGazprom, a Russian-owned energy company, is leading the project, and a number of European companies are investing. Engie, OMV, Royal Dutch Shell, Uniper, and Wintershall are all involved. The project would increase German imports of natural gas from Russia, but would fall far shy of the 60 to 70 percent dependence on Russian energy that Trump recently claimed. Russian natural-gas comprises roughly 10 percent of Germany's energy portfolio, according to reports.\nStill, Barrasso, the Republican Policy Committee chairman, blasted Germany over its support for the project on the Senate floor Wednesday.\nThe bill would slap sanctions on companies that provide financing or material support to the pipeline. But an off-ramp is also included: The bill allows the president to waive sanctions by simply notifying Congress that waivers are in the U.S.'s national security interest.\nStill, the language is tougher than the pipeline provision in the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a package of sanctions against Russia and North Korea that passed Congress with a veto-proof majority in July 2017.\nSome lawmakers have encouraged the administration to use the provision in CAATSA to sanction entities that support Nord Stream 2, but officials haven't budged. Barrasso's proposal specifically outlines that the president \"shall impose\" CAATSA sanctions on any person or company involved in the pipeline's development.\nSen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is also on board, and Barrasso announced the legislation alongside the full Senate leadership team Tuesday. Many experts say the bill is viable, and Republicans and Democrats alike are already signaling they\u2019ll likely back it.\nEuropean allies are likely eyeing Congress as a key interlocutor in light of Trump\u2019s slew of recent confrontations with NATO member countries. Some experts say the sanctions bill, however, is likely to exacerbate tensions.\nBut the bill is also a potentially critical"}

But, sadly, Alabama didn\u2019t ratify the 19th Amendment until 1953.\nWhat\u2019s more, even after they gained the vote, Alabama state law prohibited women from serving on juries in state court.

The 2015 Report used four measures for women\u2019s political status: registration, voter turnout, representation in elected office and women\u2019s institutional resources. Alabama ranked in the bottom ten, with an overall grade of D-.\nAlabama ranks 22nd in the percentage of women registered to vote (68.8%), and 28th in the percent of women who voted (52.9%), according to the Report. Even a modest increase in this registration and in voter turnout could determine the outcome when voters come to the polls for the special election this December.\nIn the recent Virginia election for governor, women voted for the winning candidate, Ralph Northam by a 61% to 39% margin, while men voted for Republican Ed Gillespie by a 50% to 48% margin, according to exit polls by Edison Media Research.\nThe revelations about Roy Moore\u2019s past have upended political polling, but the gender gap remains constant.

But if we can remove the party labels from the candidates in this race, the choice becomes much clearer.\nDoug Jones is staying focused on the kitchen table issues that have defined his career\u200a\u2014\u200ahealthcare, education, justice, and jobs. Roy Moore, on the other hand, is running on ultra-conservative issues while defending himself from constant scandals.\nWomen in Alabama have come a long way during the 20th century, and our journey is far from over.

He plays video games on a regular basis as the \"clueless gamer,\" we can call this the \"clueless moviegoer.\" Although to be fair, the women are having an equally awkward experience. It doesn\u2019t really matter how many times you\u2019re told this is a comedy bit, at the end of the day your boss is taking his shirt off and dancing in front of you. That has to be more than a little creepy. We assume releases were signed by all to prevent lawsuits. Also, while we totally understand that this bit was entirely scripted, there isn\u2019t a single other guy shown in line or in the theater with Conan. Nobody dragged their husband or boyfriend to this? Not one? Really?\nIt looks like Conan and crew weren\u2019t the only ones to go see Magic Mike XXL as the movie looks ready to dance all over the holiday weekend. It\u2019s getting better reviews than Terminator: Genisys, and the early box office reports are looking much better for Mike than Arnold. To be fair, Arnold is getting up there in age. It\u2019s probably getting tough for him to dance.\nWe hope this becomes a regular occurrence on Conan. We\u2019re looking forward to when he takes a limo full of comic book geeks to see Ant-Man in a couple weeks. Instead of dancing and drinking fruity drinks, Conan can get involved in a deep conversation on the continuity of Hank Pym vs. Scott Lang over a case of Mountain Dew."}

All told, 90 percent of the TVs sold in the last few years are potential victims of similar attacks, Scheel said during a presentation to the European Broadcasting Union last month.\nThe first part of the hack that Scheel presented takes advantage of the fact that terrestrial broadcasting now uses digital signals in many countries (the US transitioned to digital in 2009). An attacker could embed malicious code into a digital TV signal using a low-cost transmitter, which could reach several TV sets nearby in a densely-populated city neighborhood.\nAfter the signal reaches the smart TV, it would exploit known security flaws in their web browsers to gain root access to the operating system. Given the security flaws present in many other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the malicious code could be designed to spread to other devices connected to the same wired or wireless network as the TV.\n\"Once a hacker has control over the TV of an end user, he can harm the user in a variety of ways,\" Scheel told Ars Technica. \"Among many others, the TV could be used to attack further devices in the home network or to spy on the user with the TV's camera and microphone.\"\nThe security vulnerabilities of IoT devices have been well documented, as has the use of TVs to spy on their users (sometimes by design). Samsung, whose TVs Scheel used to demonstrate the viability of the attack, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}

{"idx": "22258", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A brilliant business often starts with an entrepreneur dreaming up a fantastic business idea. Most entrepreneurs at the beginning of their journeys are often strapped for cash, and according to a recent study, 95% of seed-stage founders thought it would either remain the same or get harder to raise money. Even access to Angel funds at the very start (idea stage) is generally uncommon.\nStartups want to sprout their ideas fast, and the last thing they want is to spend their time and energy is to find the ground, dig the soil, remove the weeds before sowing the seed, and water it till the idea breathes life.\nWhat I mean here is that it is absolutely unnecessary for the entrepreneurs (who want to surprise the customer in areas other than IT infrastructure) to learn how to evaluate and buy the server, storage, network gears, software, tools and also find/build/collocate a data centre. Public cloud is where a startup should go (and almost every startup does) to get their IT infrastructure to jump start their development. Public cloud saves time, effort and money; all of which are high premium resources available at the entrepreneur\u2019s disposal.\nFor any startup that wants to offer services on the cloud, allowing its business to be born into the cloud is important, for reasons such as accessibility, scalability and being able to correct any mistakes quickly and effectively. Investors will want to see this as part of the business model, and customers will want to experience the beta on the cloud too.\nThe real fun begins when a startup begins to acquire customers. Now they are live. As a startup\u2019s customer base grows, the computational, storage and performance needs grow. Alongside this, security needs become critical, as the IT infrastructure becomes core to the business sustenance, and just as a startup thinks it is able to manage the growth, the demand starts to climb the exponential curve and you are desperately searching for clues how to assure service excellence to your customers.\nTo make the ride even harder, the cloud services provider experiences an outage, and a startup has absolutely no control over it; the company is completely at the mercy of the public cloud provider. Now, the startup is trying to perform damage control instead of growing the business further and the media is becoming extremely generous by splashing the news all over.\nSo what can a startup business do to avoid this scenario?\nDon\u2019t believe it if someone tells you that such outages are not very common. By just searching on the internet, you can see many instances of it documented \u2013 for example, Microsoft Azure\u2019s systems experienced two outages in March, the second taking place not even 24 hours after the systems had been brought back online from the first outage that month.\nThe low initial costs of setting up infrastructure on a public cloud should not sideline a startup business. As the business grows, it will become evident that any operational time lost due to outages or performance bottlenecks will be very costly through more than just money; reputation and losing customers is also at risk. Therefore it is important to take a long term view. It may be worth investing in strategic partnership with a cloud infrastructure and security services provider such as Happiest Minds, who take accountability on its behalf to ensure the continuous monitoring, management, optimal usage, and excellent understanding of a cloud vendor\u2019s cloud model.\nAt some point in the journey, depending on how fast the business grows and how the growth intensifies the consumption of public cloud services, there will be a situation where the services on the cloud will begin to tip in favor of setting up a virtual private cloud or even an on-premise solution. If the enterprise is not proactive and does not switch at the right point, the subsequent decision making will be drawn out, complex"}

{"idx": "22260", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Food insecurity rates in Nunavut are among the highest in the world for an indigenous population living in a developed country. In fact, over two-thirds of people in Nunavut have trouble finding enough affordable, nutritious food. This is not acceptable, and Canada must act.\nFood is a basic human need, a part of cultural identity, and an essential building block in the development of every stable, resilient, and productive society. A resilient Arctic needs a healthy population.\nFamilies struggle every day to pay for necessities such as clothing and shelter because of the amount of family income they spend on food. According to the Inuit Health Survey, the average household spends $380 per week on food, or $19,760 per year. With 49.6 percent of Inuit adults earning less than $20,000 per year, the cost of food is a shockingly large burden.\nFor centuries, Inuit survived in some of the harshest conditions on Earth, living off the land and sharing food among their extended families. Showing one\u2019s children how to follow and hunt migratory animals, shoot a harpoon, and sew warm, waterproof clothes from sealskin meant the difference between life and death.\nSouthern interest in the North had a devastating impact on Inuit culture: residential schools removed children from their families, erasing traditional knowledge and relocations into permanent communities sometimes thousands of kilometers away from familiar animal migration patterns marooned hunters.\nOne consequence of this history is that hunting is no longer an ordinary and expected part of every Inuk\u2019s life. The transition from a land-based subsistence economy to a wage-based economy has led to a decline in the number of full-time Inuit hunters. As a result, Inuit today rely mainly on store-bought food, much of it high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, shipped north at an astronomically high cost.\nA 2013 food price survey conducted by the Nunavut Bureau of Statistics found that, on average, food prices were over 140 percent higher in Nunavut than in the rest of Canada. Staple vegetables such as onions and celery were found to be, on average, 233 percent and 287 percent more expensive per kilogram, respectively.\nWhile the situation is complex, action can be taken today. A 2014 report titled \"Hunger in Nunavut: Local Food for Healthier Communities,\" released by Action Canada, a Canadian fellowship program, studied food insecurity in Nunavut and found that improving access to fresh local food is both nutritionally beneficial and culturally appropriate.\nHistorically, Northern people maintained a nutritionally viable lifestyle by consuming traditional, locally available food. Research has established that a diet based exclusively on local food sources can provide adequate levels of vitamins and nutrients, and is an excellent source of protein, healthy fat, and energy.\nYet inadequate hunting capacity in most Nunavut communities hinders access to local food. Most households would prefer to eat more local food, which is unlikely unless one has a hunter at home. Not having an active hunter in the family increases the likelihood of hunger: of the 35 percent of Nunavut households without an active hunter, 75 percent were food insecure.\nNot only do hunters help their own families, they also help to reduce hunger elsewhere in their community. Seventy-four percent of households with extra local food share with family and friends who need it the most.\nAt the same time, limited processing"}
{"idx": "22261", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Will policy changes affect affordable housing development?\nRelaxed planning could mean poor quality in expensive areas. Across London and the South-east, where the housing shortage is most acute, cost is the primary factor determining prices. Developers could build restrictively small units and still experience no trouble in selling them. We don't think this freedom for developers would constitute an improvement to the current system, but it would almost certainly have a vastly negative effect on living standards at the lower end of the market.\nSubsidy must be stable for any new social housing model to work. It will take a re-think of who we should be housing to come up with a new model. But subsidy will have to be involved, and in many ways it doesn't matter whether it's capital- or revenue-based, but it needs to be a stable source as housing is a long-term investment. The main issue at the moment is that the instability of the current model (caused by the squeeze of housing benefit, enforced borrowing limits, etc) is putting off investors who expect higher yields for the amount of risk.\nSocial landlords can't be easily replaced. The measure of success for social landlords should change \u2013 and perhaps be more closely related to how many people we deliver from subsidised to non-subsidised housing. But if we're not housing the people at the lower end of the market (which increasingly means people in low-paid work), I worry about who will do this. The markets have not been good at looking after this group in the past.\nWe need alignment. There are four big drivers for housing association new build \u2013 capital funding, income, land and planning permission. We've got to get all four aligned.\nLow rent social rent is the key. So much investment now is dependent on resources that will run out, such as public land or conversions of low rent social housing into affordable rent. The decline in capital funding through grant will ultimately lead to reduced numbers of social rent homes. Many of us support intermediate market products (like affordable rent) for those on modest incomes but this should not be the only game in town. Low rent social rent is the best product for those on no or low incomes, for the tenant and for the taxpayer, and should form the bulk of a subsidised housing programme.\nSpending review announcements on rent were significant. We shouldn't lose sight of the potential impact of the CPI+1% regime for 10 years from 2015. Based on Office for Budget Responsibility analysis of the future differences between RPI and CPI, we could see another dramatic reduction in the capacity of housing associations and councils with retained housing. Past trends have seen CPI+1% and RPI+0.5% coming to much the same thing. But it is significant that Osborne was able to capture \u00a31bn of savings in the spending review by this seemingly innocent switch. And we calculate it could be three times as much by 2025.\nIt would be a good thing if the role of social housing were greatly diminished. Rather than more subsidies from taxpayers, the emphasis should be on rescinding planning and building regulations to allow the non-subsidised sector to provide low-cost homes (this could include a large self-build sector). This is difficult politically in many areas, but even a patchwork approach that liberalised planning in some areas would be a major improvement. If new housing were built on greenfield sites away from existing towns and villages, then opposition could be muted.\nWhat's the alternative to planning regulations? The alternative to planning/building regulations is not to have any \u2013 to leave it to voluntary exchange between individuals"}

There has been a bill in Congress since 1989, but like many bills, it failed to come out of committee and died an unnoticed death.\nThe basic premise is that even though slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment, freed slaves never really had a chance to rise in the U.S. socially, financially, politically, legally or in any other meaningful way. The lack of money, land ownership, education, and any expectation of social advancement handicapped these new citizens as much as the attitude of whites that saw black skin to mean poor, uneducated, and incapable of meaningful employment. This basic white attitude was prevalent in the North and South alike. This failure to the freed slaves of 1865 resulted in a lack of opportunity to their descendants that continues today.\nReparation usually does mean cash payments. Indeed, the U.S. government paid slave owners for each slave freed by the 13th Amendment. The U.S. also paid Jews who suffered in the Holocaust and Japanese imprisoned in the World War II internment camps. It is a common practice in history. Many countries - when a group has been disadvantaged - pay members of that group to repair the damage incurred. Its precedent can even be found in scripture, Deuteronomy 15: 12\u201315.\nIt does appear to me that as a society we have become less racist, and I hope that time will eventually remove this line that separates black and white. But when I examine that hope, I doubt my conviction. I do not think every policeman is a racist but cannot dismiss that blacks are more likely to be stopped, arrested, and killed by police. I have never been stopped driving while white and my dad never had to have the talk about what to do when stopped by the police.\nChanging my beliefs is just not enough. I easily identify with Bernie Sanders when he says racism will not be solved by writing a check to every slave's descendant, but isn't it natural for a white man to feel that way?\nAs a culture, we need something, a truth and reconciliation moment, and it needs to be a lot more than our nation\u2019s leaders saying we\u2019re sorry, slavery was wrong. Money talks in America and maybe a $100,000 check to every black person on their 18th birthday will not compensate for the history of discrimination that has been the American way.

His mother, Maureen, is the head designer at Carters, while his brother, Lou, has an extensive history in fashion as well.

In the late seventies into the eighties, brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton were known to represent a certain type of person. They represented status through their clothing; their ready-to-wear pieces included nothing more than suits, button-ups, loafers, and premium leathers.\nDapper Dan revolutionized this side of fashion by incorporating standard streetwear attire such as velour sweat suits, t-shirts and puffy jackets and even the interior of your Mercedes Benz with printed logos of brands like Gucci, MCM, Louis Vuitton and Fendi. Dan\u2019s designs were worn by people who Gucci hadn\u2019t intended their clothing be worn by: drug dealers, hustlers, and rappers.

Environmental groups are sounding an alarm, saying the trade in illegal timber fosters corruption and encourages the devastation of some of the globe's most fragile regions.\nIn a report last month, one watchdog group described China as \"the largest buyer of stolen timber in the world.\"\nThe British-based Environmental Investigation Agency said it had uncovered \"the world's biggest timber smuggling racket\"\u2014a route controlled by crime syndicates that send some 20 shiploads a month of exotic hardwood logs from Indonesia to China.\n\"At the policy level, they always say, `We will try to step up efforts to tackle smuggling.' But actually there is such a huge need for timber. The local customs officials keep one eye open and one eye closed,\" said Wen Bo, a Beijing-based expert with Pacific Environment, a U.S. advocacy group.\nSome experts say China is a part of a lengthy chain in which illegal logs are \"laundered\" on the way to market. Once hewn, the logs are transported on the high seas and given forged papers, processed in China, then exported to Western markets or purchased by Chinese consumers.\nIn its Feb. 17 report, the Environmental Investigation Agency estimated that 44 percent of China's timber imports are illegal. Other watchdog groups have said that between a third and a half of China's timber imports were logged illegally.\nThe U.S. timber industry, often at odds with environmentalists, agrees that the problem is serious.\n\"China's sources for hardwood log imports reads like a `Who's Who' of countries with problems with illegal logging,\" says a report issued in November for the American Forest & Paper Association, a U.S. trade group.\nThe report estimated that 50 percent of China's hardwood log imports from Russia and West Africa \"may be considered to be of `suspicious' or illegal origin.\"\nChina is now the world's second biggest importer of logs. Its main timber suppliers are Russia, Malaysia and Indonesia, although Papua New Guinea, Gabon, Burma, Cambodia, New Zealand and Brazil are also important. Many of those countries face social conflicts over logging and land use. China's timber contracts with Burma give its military regime an economic lifeline.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency report said logging theft from Indonesia \"is being organized by powerful syndicates of brokers and fixers\" that can gin up phony documents for shipment to China.\nMost of the illegal timber is merbau, a luxurious and valuable hardwood, taken from Indonesia's Papua province to China, said Julian Newman, a researcher for the group.

Having worked in government for ten years, I thought I had met every single genius there was to know \u2013 until I met the Chief. I was pretty much terrified as my answers to his questions seemed absolutely lacking all the time. My so called government experience literally took a different turn. I knew instantly I had to do some \u201cshaping up\u201d as obviously I was a bit rusty when it came to fully comprehending issues that involved the law.\nI\u2019m no lawyer, but nevertheless I thought I knew enough to get me by in my life as a journalist, until I met the Spox. There were moments where I wanted to shrivel up and cry (not die, cause I\u2019m no quitter) every time the Secretary told me he\u2019d flunk me had I been his student.\nLuckily for me, I\u2019m one for a challenge as I always try to remind myself that learning is lifelong. But obviously, I had a lot to learn.\nIn this particular journey I have come to realize that the one valuable virtue that Salvador Panelo has is his patience. His keen mind and ability to quickly grasp the feel of issues is a combination that not many people have. I dare say at times, it is lethal. But despite the many questions thrown at him day in and day out, it is his patience that enables him to successfully get the message across.\nBacked up by his long-time experience as a broadcaster, Secretary Panelo flawlessly relates with the media quite naturally, and although I have initially seen him as a terror like the teacher you dread to see in the hallway, I have come to appreciate the many learnings I have gained from the person who speaks for the President.\nIn time, I had also learned that there was a different side to the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel and Spokesperson. He is a genuine family man who never forgets that love for family is absolutely important and that this is the basis of any man\u2019s success. I have witnessed the Secretary\u2019s performance at a concert once and I was taken aback by his performance not to mention his skill as a songwriter. Yes, the Secretary is not just a concert performer but also a talented songwriter and his songs are mostly dedicated to his wife and his departed special child Carlo. While many of us, myself included, see the Secretary in every event one can possibly be invited to, in reality he is a simple man. He is the only Cabinet member that does not travel with an assistant or staff in tow. He has no self entitlement issues and can easily blend with the crowd. Perhaps this is why he and the President have been friends for decades. As for the Chief\u2019s fashion sense, I really haven\u2019t seen any other Cabinet member pull off tattered jeans with designer coats. His fashion sense never escapes the eye of the President as well as reputable fashion designers in the country.\nLearning is truly lifelong and like I always say, at a time when our country is facing many interesting changes, it is truly exciting to witness firsthand a person who can explain the issues and literally \u201cnip in the bud\u201d allegations in defense of a growing republic and an unorthodox and controversial Chief Executive. A fire extinguisher as we all know works by removing heat from the fire. It plays a crucial role in protecting the environment.

There is a lot to consider before committing to sell your life insurance policy, so make sure you understand the whole process before do sell the policy to avoid surprises during the process. If you find yourself unable to pay the premiums or no longer need life insurance, you can sell your life insurance for its cash value. Here are a few quick-tips on selling your life insurance policy.\nMost people aged 65-70 want to sell their life insurance policy. Younger people may qualify for a life settlement if they have certain medical conditions. The most desired policies are universal life insurance policies with over $100K. However, that doesn't mean smaller life insurance policies can't be sold.\nSelling your life insurance policy is either handled by a broker or a provider. A broker will shop your policy around to get the highest bid and best sale price. Providers will purchase your life insurance back from you and give you a portion of the cash. Brokers handle most life insurance policy sales, but not always.\nA broker will provide details of the policy and your medical records to potential buyers. Buyers will calculate your life expectancy based on these medical records and make an offer. At that point, you can choose to sell your policy to the buyer. The buyer will begin paying premiums, or they could re-sell it to another broker.\nHow much you will get for your life insurance depends on your expectancy and the amount your policy is worth. Brokers also calculate how much they'll pay in premiums while you're still alive to keep the policy active. When you die, the owner of your life insurance policy will receive the benefits.\nSelling your life insurance policy can be a way to generate quick income, but you should be careful.\nThe valuation of your policy is hard to judge accurately. Brokers may also charge large commissions for matching you with a buyer, up to 30%.\nYou will probably have to pay taxes on any money you receive from a life settlement. The benefits of the policy are tax-free when paid out.\nIf you sell your policy to a broker, your family will no longer receive the insurance payout when you die.\nReceiving a life settlement could affect any assistance you receive from the government.\nDo you still need life insurance coverage?\nIf you have beneficiaries who rely on your financially and you can still make the premium payments, it's probably smarter to keep the policy.\nCan I keep paying my premiums?\nIf you find that you can't make your premium payments anymore, there are a few steps to take before selling your policy. Speak with your provider about lowering the death benefits. That will give you a more manageable payment.\nIf you have decided to sell your life insurance policy, make sure your broker is licensed through the state insurance department."}

(Huron and U.S. Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication v. Cobert, Director of U.S. Office of Personnel Management (C.A.F.C. No. 14-5042, 1/19/2016)).\nThe facts described here are taken from the court\u2019s decision dismissing the lawsuit.\nMost readers are aware that the Office of Personnel Management is in charge of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB). In this role, the agency contracts with many insurance companies on a year-to-year basis for plans to be served up to employees and retirees as part of the annual open season selection process.\nSince 2008 OPM has \u201cencouraged\u201d rather than required the plans to cover speech-generating devices under their durable medical equipment coverage for FEHB. In response to this encouragement, some policies cover the devices and some do not. Of those that provide coverage, it varies in amount.\nThe plaintiffs are a non-profit society with interest in such issues, and Mr. Huron, who is both a member of the Society and a spouse covered through his wife\u2019s FEHB insurance. Huron uses a speech-generating device that was previously covered by his private insurance. After switching to his wife\u2019s GEHA policy through the FEHB, Huron\u2019s $5000 device went kaput. However, GEHA provides no coverage for the device and Medicare reimburses only 80% of the cost for a new one.\nWithout going into the detailed legal analysis, essentially the court concluded there was no jurisdiction because Huron\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d (no coverage for the device by GEHA) is not traceable to OPM\u2019s actions, but rather to Huron\u2019s decision to pick a plan that did not cover the device even though other FEHB plans did.\nWhile the plaintiffs raised an issue of more than passing interest to those who rely on these devices, they will not get their day in court. The lesson perhaps is when selecting coverage during the annual open season, be careful to do your due diligence if you rely on particular medical devices or procedures that not all plans may cover.\nHealth Insurance Premiums Up in 2016: What Will You Pay for Self Plus One Coverage?"}

Following the announcement, President Obama\u2019s allies applauded the administration\u2019s resolve to crack down on trade manipulators.\nThere\u2019s not much to applaud. Tariffs are blunt tools that the government should deploy sparingly, and this case is a good example of why.\nIt\u2019s true that Beijing has channeled state resources into solar-panel manufacturing. Chinese firms now claim two-thirds of the world market. Chinese panel manufacturers have driven down global prices to the point that even they have lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year.\nBut how much should a Chinese-made solar panel cost?

Analysts worry that the Chinese will retaliate by slapping duties on U.S. polysilicon. Also at risk is the U.S. solar installation business, which has thrived during this period of low-cost panels.\nThese risks will be exacerbated if the administration proceeds more aggressively, as U.S. solar-panel producers and their allies in Congress urge. Under Commerce\u2019s latest decision, regulators left in place a way for Chinese manufacturers to avoid the tariffs by assembling panels from solar cells built outside China.

But for lots of reasons, mostly to do with economics and, inevitably, the Internet, the industry has moved away from that model.\nSo who does she blame? Not just the Internet, which splinters culture into a thousand different directions by supplanting big-name fashion magazines with ten-thousand happy Instagrammers. The economy, too, is to blame, by distracting designers with enormous price tags available on the luxury market.\nHow about this: these days there are no scenes or genres, only \"aesthetics.\" A scene implies a physical community in physical architectures, and as such is a fatal slur against the URL everspace and its viral lungs.

We know both cities are cooling \u2013 Sydney faster than Melbourne (but remember, Sydney had a faster rate of growth during the boom).\nWe also know that neither market is going to crash because there are too many fundamentals holding prices up, such as the undersupply, high population growth largely due to migration, very low interest rates, low unemployment and a strong economy.\nBut we\u2019re certainly seeing prices paring back, with auction clearance rates falling into the 50% bracket in Sydney and the low 60% in Melbourne.\nGiven the property market is cyclical in nature, it\u2019s reasonable to rely on history for an indication of how low prices might go.\nIn terms of where we are now, the latest CoreLogic data shows Sydney home values have fallen -4.2% since June last year, while Melbourne values have risen 2.2%. But a recent acceleration in Melbourne\u2019s cooling is apparent with an -0.5% decline in values in May and a three month decline of -1.2%, which is its largest fall over a three month period since 2012.\nPrice movements in both cities are tracked monthly and what we\u2019re seeing so far is a very orderly softening of prices. Sydney has experienced extremely small monthly declines in median values since September last year. Out in the marketplace, you can feel that the heat has gone but it\u2019s not translating into a big drop in the city\u2019s median price.\nThe great thing about this stage of the cycle is seeing buyers get a bit of negotiating power back. The urgency has gone, competition is weaker, there\u2019s more homes for sale and much less risk of paying a premium at auction. We\u2019re getting back to normal market conditions.\nThis is a good thing, especially for first home buyers. The timing couldn\u2019t be more perfect for young people in Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 they\u2019ve got generous stamp duty concessions; property prices are easing; and there\u2019s far less competition from their investor rivals.\nIs a cooling market a bad thing for owners? Of course not. It\u2019s actually extremely positive because market corrections prevent bubbles. We want a period of consolidation now to cement in the significant price gains of the boom.\nPut the price falls happening now into perspective. Around this time last year, when we were close to the peak of the boom, Sydney house prices were up 67% and Melbourne house prices were up 40% since mid-2012 when the growth cycle began.\nSo, even if they fall by 8%-10% or more, most home owners shouldn\u2019t be concerned by this.\nAt the end of the day, the gains made during the boom will far outweigh any price falls we experience now.\nHome > The Experts > John McGrath > How low will Sydney and Melbourne prices"}

That was the year Republicans swept the midterm elections to win control of Congress, and ideological passions were running high. I had noticed that when a prominent Republican or conservative said something offensive about liberals, it typically set off a storm of media condemnation, while an anti-conservative smear voiced by a liberal or a Democrat rarely drew any protest. There was no end of sour commentary, for example, when Newt Gingrich recommended that Clinton Democrats be portrayed as \"the enemy of normal Americans.\" It was an outrageous remark, and Gingrich deserved the drubbing he received.\nBut when Jesse Jackson explicitly likened the proposals of the new majority to Nazism and apartheid -- \"If this were Germany, we would call it fascism. If this were South Africa, we would call it racism\" -- there wasn't even a ripple of disapproval.

MSNBC fired right-wing talk host Michael Savage in July, and rightly so, when he told a gay caller to \"get AIDS and die, you pig.\" The liberal Nina Totenberg, on the other hand, suffered no ill effects for saying, during the flap over General Jerry Boykin's views of Islam and the war on terrorism, \"I hope he's not long for this world.\" When the startled host asked if she were \"putting a hit out on this guy,\" Totenberg backtracked and said she only wanted to see him expire \"in his job.\"\nBut this isn't the first time the NPR diva has publicly wished death on a conservative. \"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind,\" she said of Senator Jesse Helms in 1995, \"because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will.\"\nSuch venom should be beyond the pale.

That\u2019s not all he has in common with his old boss.\nRandolph has shown patience, and that is so important for an organization trying to develop from within.

Baseball is not football, where 12 games tell a story and Steinbrenner has never and will never understand that.\nBy giving Matsui time to learn his new position, they are also saying they don\u2019t want to make any more quick decision on players, like they did on Scott Kazmir, deciding he was not right for them even though he can throw lightning bolts.\nThe Mets are doing the right thing with Matsui even though it may seem wrong when you look at the numbers and how Matsui is playing second base.

The remaining roughly 60 percent of feds would continue to report to work, but would not be guaranteed pay until after the government reopens. Historically, Congress has elected to also grant back pay to federal workers who were sent home during lapses in appropriations.\nAn update to Office of Management and Budget guidance during the Obama administration required agencies to refresh their shutdown plans at least every two years starting in 2015. Nearly all agencies updated their documents spelling out who would or would not be furloughed in September of that year. Sixty-three agencies submitted their updated shutdown guidance to OMB in the last two months detailing who they would furlough under an appropriations lapse.\nThe plans vary significantly from agency to agency. The Veterans Affairs Department, for example, would furlough just 4.2 percent of 377,000 employees, while the Housing and Urban Development Department would furlough more than 96 percent of its 7,800-person workforce. The National Labor Relations Board would require just 10 of its 1,600 employees to work through a shutdown.\nSome agencies would experience a shutdown in vastly different ways among their components. At the Commerce Department, the Census Bureau would furlough 99.9 percent of its workers, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would have more than half of its employees working. About 87 percent of the Internal Revenue Service would face furloughs, compared to less than 20 percent of the Treasury Department\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service.\nAt the Health and Human Services Department, the Indian Health Service would retain 95 percent of its workers while the National Institutes of Health would have less than one-quarter of its employees reporting. Agency overseers would also have varying roles. The Interior Department would furlough its entire inspector general\u2019s office, while Treasury would retain 15 percent of its watchdog employees.\nThe numbers in the chart below are fluid, and can vary based on a shutdown\u2019s duration and various factors that might force agencies to recall workers. The Defense Department in 2013 initially furloughed about 400,000 civilian employees, but later recalled nearly all of them after Pentagon and Justice Department officials determined that a measure to ensure military personnel continued to receive their paychecks on time provided the authority for practically the entire civilian workforce to report for duty.\nThe Pentagon did not respond to an inquiry into what approach it was planning to take this year, but early on Friday, the Defense Department posted 14-page \u201cguidance for continuation operations.\u201d If a shutdown happens, here are the basics, according to the guidance: Active duty servicemembers, keep going to work. Defense civilians: don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve been designated excepted or exempted. Everyone at Defense: cancel your Temporary Duty travel. Contractors: keep working, as long as your program is fully funded.\nThe State Department sent home less than 1 percent of its workforce in 2013, but warned it would have had to furlough thousands more employees if the appropriations lapse had"}

Aided by the early absence of star Detroit receiver Calvin Johnson, Tate ranks third in the NFL with 950 receiving yards on 68 catches through 10 games.\nThe Seahawks\u2019 leading receiver, Doug Baldwin, has just 485 receiving yards on 44 catches. Seattle has been without a clear No. 1 receiver \u2014 and, arguably, even a No. 2 receiver \u2014 since trading Harvin to the New York Jets on Oct. 17.\n\u201cI still root for the Seahawks,\u201d Tate told MLive.com last week. \u201cThat\u2019s the team that drafted me, that\u2019s the team that gave me the opportunity to be in this position. So I have a lot of respect and appreciation for Seattle."}

{"idx": "22321", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This article is coauthored with Jonathan Nelson.\nMillennials have been called the most entrepreneurial generation. While this may be true based on their desires to start businesses, millennials are not following through on their entrepreneurial dreams.\nA Bentley University survey of millennials found 66% of respondents have a desire to start their own business, 37% would like to work for themselves, and 25% would like to own their own company. Yet, as of 2013, only 3.6% of all businesses were owned by someone under the age of 30. Considering that the youth unemployment rate hovers at 10%, it is no wonder that millennials are delaying starting businesses.\nThe Brookings Institution reports that business startup rates are much lower now than in the 1980s. Business dynamism, determined by firm entry, firm exit, and job reallocation rates, has declined by over 4%. The fall in entrepreneurship is leading to the aging of American businesses, Brookings Institution economists Ian Hathaway and Robert Litan argue. In 1992, 23% of firms had existed for 16 years. By 2011, this percentage had increased to 34%.\nWhile the Kauffman Foundation found that startups were beginning to resurge in 2015, there is still cause for concern. New business formation, including new business failure, is vital for economic growth. Entrepreneurs who start businesses greatly contribute to net job creation.\nStartups are also important for increasing productivity. An Oganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report shows that the slowing of productivity growth among high-income nations is not caused by sluggish innovation from cutting-edge firms. Rather, the problem is that other, older firms that are not keeping up. Startups are often the most productive because \u201cyoung firms possess a comparative advantage in commercializing radical innovations.\u201d Productivity rises with the creation of new high-productivity firms and the exit of low-productivity competitors.\nFor the most part, corporate innovation cannot replace startups because corporations and start-ups have two different goals. Established companies tend to stick to a business model that has proven successful. Startups, by definition, are initiating new business models that their founders believe to be original or superior to those of existing companies. Recall the new business models pioneered by millennials such as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook, Brian Chesky\u2019s Airbnb, or Drew Houston\u2019s Dropbox.\nWhen there are fewer entrepreneurs and new market entrants, innovation lags and existing companies face lower pressure to improve quality or lower prices. This is because new businesses are the main drivers of disruptive innovation that is, as economist John Dearie puts it, \"the sort of radical, rock-the-establishment innovation that re-makes the economic landscape, propels productivity and economic growth, and creates opportunity, wealth, and jobs for millions.\"\nThere are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as Amazon. Amazon\u2019s research and development spending rate (calculated by dividing R&D spending by revenue) has increased by 62% since 2007. Anecdotally, there are many examples of Amazon\u2019s remarkable innovations, including Amazon Prime , Kindle products, and the 1-Click Purchase option.\nAlthough it began as a simple but elegant search engine, Google has continued to innovate. Google\u2019s research and development spending rate has increased by 62% since 2004. Some of its innovations include Google Ads, YouTube, and Google\u2019"}

The highest it has ever advanced is to the quarter-finals, placing sixth in both 1986 and 1970.\nLozano's goal set off such a commotion that seismic detectors in Mexico City registered a false earthquake, which the geological institute said may have been generated by \"massive jumps\" across the city. Spectators who had gathered to watch the match on a big TV screen in the central Zocalo square screamed with joy after the score.\nAfter the match, throngs of fans dressed in green converged around the iconic Angel of Independence monument, bouncing with joy and waving the Mexican flag. Small groups chanted \"Mexico\" and \"Yes we could!\" Some broke into song, including the traditional Cielito Lindo tune best known for its \"Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay\" chorus. Car horns blared, whistles were blown and drums beat for hours after the match.\n\"We aspire to win a World Cup this time,\" said Miguel Paez, a 31-year-old who donned a Mexican wrestling mask in the colors of the national flag as he celebrated on Mexico City's main avenue, Paseo de la Reforma.\nPaez described the game as a welcome distraction from Mexico's upcoming July 1 presidential election. \"Mexico needs a break. Mexico needs to shout,\" he said, jumping up and down.\nSome Twitter commentators and fans were quick to draw parallels between the Mexican team's long odds ahead of the Germany match and the big lead in surveys enjoyed by leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, or AMLO.\n\"AMLO can be beat. The surveys are based on few people,\" said Jose Antonio Bohon, a 51-year-old national team supporter on his way to the Angel.\nThe win has also helped Mexican fans move beyond the team's recent indiscretions.\nThe Mexican squad entered the 2018 tournament under a cloud of scandal. The problems began last year when the US Treasury Department accused team captain Rafael Marquez of being a front man for a drug kingpin. The accusation cost Marquez sponsorships and called into question whether he would play in the tournament. Marquez took to the field toward the end of Sunday's match against Germany, notching his fifth appearance in a World Cup.\nAlso, earlier in June, gossip magazine TVNotas reported that nine members of the Mexican squad indulged in an all-night party with 30 female escorts following their farewell match against Scotland in Mexico City. Commentators worried that family tensions could distract the players from their goal of winning World Cup matches.\n\"They've always done things like that,\" 53-year-old fan Magdalena Martinez said Sunday of the partying Mexican players. \"It wasn't my boyfriend or my husband, so as long as they continue to play"}

It is believed to be the sole user and likely developer of a Trojan program called Sofacy or X-Agent.\nX-Agent variants for Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS have been found in the wild in the past, but researchers from Bitdefender have now come across what appears to be the first macOS version of the Trojan.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how the malware is being distributed because the Bitdefender researchers only obtained the malware sample, not the full attack chain. However, it\u2019s possible a macOS malware downloader dubbed Komplex, found in September, might be involved.\nKomplex infected Macs by exploiting a known vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus software, according to researchers from Palo Alto Networks who investigated the malware at the time. The vulnerability allowed attackers to execute remote commands on a Mac when users visited specially crafted webpages.\nPalo Alto Networks noted similarities between the Komplex downloader and a variant of the Carberp Trojan that APT28 is also known to have used. The command-and-control domain names used by the Trojan had also been associated with APT28\u2019s activity.\nThe new X-Agent macOS version uses very similar domain names to the Komplex Trojan, with only their TLD different, the Bitdefender researchers said. There are also identical project path strings inside both the Komplex and X-Agent samples, suggesting they were created by the same author.\nThe X-Agent malware can load additional modules, which the Bitdefender researchers are still investigating. So far, they\u2019ve found functionality that allows attackers to probe the system for hardware and software configurations, grab a list of running processes, execute additional files, get desktop screenshots, and harvest browser passwords. One module is designed to search for and steal iPhone backups stored on Macs, which can contain further sensitive information about the targeted users.\nAPT28 is considered to be one of the most sophisticated and successful cyberespionage groups in the world and it frequently uses zero-day exploits\u2014exploits for previously unknown vulnerabilities.

Katz, Special to The Christian Science Monitor The writer is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., specializing in Soviet policy in the Arabian Peninsula.\nDespite speculation to the contrary, Saudi Arabia does not intend to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, according to several high-level Saudi officials.\nIn Washington, the Saudi ambassador's dinner invitation to Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin last month did not signal improved ties between the two countries, these officials say. Prince Bandar bin Sultan's invitation was merely a courtesy to Mr. Dobrynin, who is the dean of Washington's diplomatic corps.\nContinued or increased American support for Israel may lead to strained Saudi-American ties, the Saudi officials say. Many Arab nations have urged the Saudis to seek better relations with Moscow in the hopes that the US will decrease its support for Israel if it fears it may lose one of its most important Arab allies.\nOfficials in Riyadh say this tactic would not work. Better Saudi-Soviet relations would only lead the US to increase aid to Israel, they say.\nMore important, Saudi officials say, they will agree to exchange ambassadors with Moscow only if there are tangible benefits to Riyadh.\n* Withdraw all their forces from Afghanistan.\n* End all hostile propaganda against the kingdom and reduce their presence, particularly military, in both South Yemen and Ethiopia.\n* Allow Soviet Muslims greater freedom to practice their religion.\nEven if the Soviets meet these conditions, the Saudis will not necessarily exchange ambassadors, the Saudis add. The proper ''psychological climate'' also must exist.\nThe officials have no illusions that the Soviets intend to meet any, much less all, of these conditions. As a result, Saudi-Soviet relations will not improve, they say.\nA senior official denied there was any contradiction in Riyadh's policy of refusing to improve ties with the USSR while supporting Syria, one of the Soviets' closest Mideast allies. The official stressed that, despite Washington's belief, Syria is not a Soviet puppet. He said it was the US policy of attempting to isolate Syria in the Middle East that has pushed Damascus closer to Moscow and induced it to become anti-American.\nThe Saudis fear that continued US support to Israel will only make it increasingly difficult for America's Arab friends to convince their neighbors and their own populations of the benefits of good relations with the US. This may cause a further decline or even an end to American-Arab cooperation, they say. Should this happen, the Saudis warn, Soviet penetration into the Arab world would only be made easier.\nA senior official said that although Soviet and Israeli policies are not coordinated, they seem to have a common goal: to destabilize and weaken existing Arab governments.\nAlthough the Soviet Union is of grave concern to the Saudis, a senior official in Riyadh lamented that Saudi Arabia has little detailed knowledge about the Soviet Union.\nThis situation is being remedied at least in part by the formation of analysis groups in Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry and in its newly created Center for Strategic Studies, which is attached to the Council of Ministers. The Foreign Ministry's group is concerned mainly with growing trade between Saudi Arabia and East-bloc states.\nGlobal News Blog Why did India need to intervene to help foreign workers in Saudi Arabia?"}

Thereafter legal action was filed in the Supreme Court, which observed a blatant violation of the process when awarding the tender.\nThe decision comes despite the Power and Energy Ministry was said to have been taken aback\u201d last week when the spot tender they called for coal had the lowest price for this commodity at USD 64.77 per metric tonne. However, it was reported on Monday (22), according to Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S Batagoda, that the Power and Energy Ministry would continue to contract with Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Limited for the supply of coal. The reason given for this has been that their contract price was USD 7 less than what was quoted in a recent spot tender at USD 58 per metric tonne.\nHowever, the Daily Mirror learns that in order to arrive at the complete price which has to be paid to Swiss Singapore the calculations have to be made according to an API 4 Index. This figure does not seem to have been taken into account in classifying Swiss Singapore as the best option because had it been accounted for, the calculations would have shown that the long term tender with this company would have resulted in USD 9.17 more per metric tonne than what would have been spent using the spot tender method.\nThis in turn translates into an excessive spending of USD 3,026,100 for the required 330,000 metric tonnes of coal in September.\nThe figures given by the Power and Energy Ministry has also been questioned publicly by Wasantha Samarasinghe of the Voice Against Corruption Movement.\nFurthermore the continuation to contract with Swiss Singapore flies in the face of the concerns that were raised by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka after this controversy that has racked the local coal industry was brought to light by fundamental rights petitions that were filed by two other coal suppliers.\nBeyond this, this yahapalanaya government, CBK, Sirisena, the JVP, the JHU, Sarath Fonseka and the like are extremely corrupt and are enjoying perks.

Lacy ran for 1,322 yards and 17 touchdowns and caught 17 passes for 189 yards as a junior in his lone season as the starter.\nLacy said his pass-catching was the second-biggest thing he wanted to show NFL teams behind his 40 time.\n\"I didn't have a lot of opportunities here at Alabama to show my hands out of the backfield,\" Lacy said. \"During the pass drills, I just wanted to go out and show them that I could catch.\n\"I probably bobbled a pass or two but everything else was caught clean.\"\nLacy worked much of the session with Miami Dolphins running backs coach Jeff Nixon. Tennessee Titans running backs coach Sylvester Croom was also among those present.\nLacy was slowed by nagging injuries early in the season but finished with two huge games.

And it\u2019s not just cricket.\nAt a time when people generally have less time, less disposable income and more distractions, every sport is fighting its own battle when it comes to junior and senior participation levels.\nBut with several local clubs having folded over the last 20 years*, and others amalgamating, the picture in Doncaster is a concerning one.\nAhead of the new season, which starts later this month, the Free Press spoke to a group of players and officials and asked them if local cricket in Doncaster is at risk of dying out and what can be done to ensure its survival?\nIt is hard to pinpoint exactly why cricket clubs are dying out but we are in danger of losing a sport that is so important to the town and the county.\nSome people believe that playing anything more than 40 overs a side is too long for younger people who have been seduced by the short formats.\nSome say the encroachment of football, which is now almost a year round sport, has not helped.\nOthers argue that there has been little or no investment in the sport.\nI think it is down to a blend of all of those reasons.\nI feel that there has been a gradual erosion of the village identity in the sport. People now live in one area of the town but play cricket miles away for another.\nI also think that the people of Doncaster no longer feel a connection to their village clubs.\nThere is a disconnect, either because the clubs have not reached out to them, the players no longer come from the area, or they do not have anyone willing to run junior teams.\nHatfield Town, for instance, put out two teams on a weekend last season and only seven of the 22 players actually lived in the village.\nSome clubs have loads of juniors and then can\u2019t raise two teams on a weekend.\nI would introduce a Doncaster village league on a Sunday to try and preserve the game.\nWith a bit of hard work from the clubs to advertise games and get people to come down and support them, I feel that Sunday cricket could be a real growth area.\nI would have a rule that players need to come from a catchment area or must have played for the club for five years. You could have a group stage and then the knockout rounds.\nIt would be a showcase for club legends and some of the larger than life characters that still play the game.\nGary Strephan, who plays for Conisbrough, is a classic example.

Morning Edition Host Rick Ganley spoke with him by phone about the school\u2019s efforts to reduce the number of concussions among athletes.\nSo what are you and your staff actually doing differently than you would have a few years ago? Tell me about this technology that you\u2019re using.\nSo one of the newest forms of technology that we use is called an insight sensor. And we\u2019re specifically talking about football at this point. Even though concussions are occurring in all sports, the spotlight right now tends to be on football the most. And so these insight sensors within the football helmet registers different types of contacts. And then that information is sent to a handheld sensor, reported to the coach or the athletic trainer who might be holding it, and then they plug that into a computer every day to analyze what information they\u2019re receiving. Then we can look at it and see this student suffered this type of head contact today, this student suffered these multiple contacts throughout this week, and then we can keep an eye on it and check those students out.\nNow people do tend to focus on football specifically regarding the topic of brain injuries, especially with all the reporting of the long term effects on NFL players, do you see more concussions with your football players than with athletes involved in other sports?\nInterestingly, I mean you\u2019re going to see more head injuries with certain sports. And so whether it\u2019s football, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, wrestling, you see them across a range of sports. But I think what would be very interesting to people is the fact that it\u2019s not just in football. Like I said, just in fall sports soccer is one that really jumps out as far as something where students\u2014they\u2019re not even necessarily hitting other students. They could just be hitting the ground. It could be a little bit of a whiplash type of symptom. It might not even be from the ball.\nHow far can you really go in prevention in football or any sport really? It\u2019s inherently dangerous isn\u2019t it?\nIt is. There\u2019s definitely a risk with participation in all sports, and we go over that in our preseason meetings. I mention that. I go over that with parents and students. I go over that with coaches to go over that with their teams. I mean some sports are a little bit more dangerous than others. I was at the concussion symposium down at SNHU last Wednesday, and there was a former Patriots player who was a speaker on the panel. And he said, you know there are some people who just really gravitate toward the contact in some of these sports. That\u2019s why they play the sports. But the important thing for us, and to kind of get back to your question, is that we need to be doing it as safely as possible. Our students\u2019 safety is our number one concern. And so what we do is we do have, you know, impact baseline testing for each student before they can participate.

Kyle Terza, chief of Home Station Training from the SMDC. \"We weren't contested in the electromagnetic spectrum. The next war might be inside this type of environment.

It effects an area up to many nautical miles, said Terza. During the air assault mission of the exercise, Terza and his team of Electronic Warfare Specialists targeted the aircraft flying above, interfering with their navigational systems.\nTerza explained he wanted the pilots to be able to recognize their navigational systems were being interfered with and be able to successfully navigate to their objective despite the interference.\n\"There is a huge perception that space is exclusively satellites in orbit and what not,\" said Capt.

The department of the UCY has already contributed to high quality research during the last 25 years, especially in the field of inherited renal diseases, but much more can and should be done.\n\u201cWe have been lagging behind in many things, when it concerns biobanking we have to catch up,\u201d he said.\nIn the near future there will be a bigger, high quality biobank of European standards and accessible to all Cypriots, with the ultimate aim of pursuing \u2018Big Science\u2019 to improve medical care for future generations, he told the Sunday Mail.\nThe importance of biobanks has been appreciated for years.\nBack in 2009, biobanks were the topic of the Time magazine list of \u201810 Ideas Changing the World Right Now\u2019. The article called the biobank \u201ca repository to safeguard your most valuable assets\u201d.\n\u201cThink of it as an organic bank account. You put your biomaterial in and earn medical interest in the form of knowledge and therapies that grow out of that deposit \u2014 no monetary reward, just the potential that you might benefit from the accumulated data at some later date,\u201d the magazine wrote.\n\u201cThe importance of biobanks has during the last decade increased in variety and capacity from small collections of samples to large-scale national or international repositories,\u201d researcher Judita Kinkorova wrote in 2016, calling this the era of personalised medicine.\nA recent study in the journal Nature has shown that, across the world, scientists\u2019 ability to reproduce research is staggeringly low. More than 70 per cent of the 1500 scientific participants in the study could not replicate other scientists\u2019 experiments. And half were unable to replicate their own experiments.\nThat is why biobanks are so important, they follow best practice guidelines and make research results reproducible as they ensure that protocols are applied in a standardised, harmonised way.\nDeltas likens the ability of having access to a biobank material to being ahead in a marathon run, where others are only starting.\nThe centre\u2019s funding is being offered with two conditions, the first one that it will be matched by another sponsor, the second that it will work with other successful European organisations as advanced partners.\nThe Cyprus government has agreed to match the \u20ac15 million offered, and the University of Cyprus has offered an additional \u20ac8 million, bringing the total to \u20ac38 million, a sum with which a lot can be done.

{"idx": "22355", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Two more reports taking the temperature of the U.S. economy were released on Thursday, providing more evidence that it continues to expand, setting records along the way. First from the Department of Labor (DOL) came the report that new claims for unemployment insurance \u2014 considered a precursor for future layoffs \u2014 dropped in August \u201cto the lowest level for initial claims since December 6, 1969.\u201d That\u2019s the lowest level in nearly 50 years!\nSmall businesses (with fewer than 50 employees) added 21,000 jobs last month while medium-sized businesses (with 50 to 499 employees) added 111,000 new workers. Large employers (500 or more employees) added 31,000 new employees. Lost in the headlines, however, were the nearly 21,000 new jobs created by the \u201cfranchise\u201d sector of the economy: restaurant chains and auto parts franchises and auto dealers, reflecting growth there as well.\nWhat surprises the \u201cexperts\u201d is how the economy can continue to hire new workers when there appear to be so few of them seeking work who have the skills needed. This past spring the Labor Department reported that there were more job openings than the number of unemployed people actively looking for work.\nOnce an applicant is matched with a full-time job, the employer sends the candidate to the ABC Institute for classes and training. They usually run one or two nights a week for two to four hours each, attended by apprentices after they are done with their regular work day.\nThose candidates work full-time from the start, and are paid for a 40-hour week. First-year electricians, for example, start at $15 an hour and enjoy $2-$3 hourly raises until they graduate at $25 an hour. If a graduate moves on to get his journeyman\u2019s license, he gets another raise to $29 an hour, or about $4,000 a month.\nThis explains why south Florida is considered a \u201cworker\u2019s market\u201d: An applicant without skills can move from zero to $15 an hour his first day on the job, and within a few years be making $25 to $30 an hour. In fact, in Miami, plumbers, electricians, brick masons, and carpenters earn far above the local median income: $55,000 to $75,000 a year, with full benefits and a pension, and without the need for a college degree.\nThe Conference Board has also been busy taking the economy\u2019s temperature. In a 2017 survey, it discovered that the highest percentage of workers polled since 2005 said they were satisfied with their jobs. And that data doesn\u2019t reflect the fact that the Trump economy really started taking off in the second quarter of this year. The Conference Board also reported that consumer confidence in August was the highest level seen in nearly 18 years, along with improved expectations for the future.\nWhat will continue to drive the economy to new levels of performance? Certainly, tax cuts, both individual and corporate, have something to do with it. And the Trump administration\u2019s policy of deregulating the economy is giving it more room to breathe. And then there\u2019s the \u201crepatriation\u201d of billions from overseas, taking advantage of the \u201ctax holiday\u201d where those foreign profits are taxed at only 15.5 percent instead of 21 percent (or, previously, 39 percent).\nBut precious little has been said about the coming wave of prosperity unleashed as Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy begins to"}

It could perhaps even result in new ways of producing nanoscale electronic components, such as transistors.\nOnce nanotubes have been fabricated, they are extremely difficult to arrange and order. Finding a way to do so should make it easier to harness the novel optical and physical properties of such nanomaterials.\nGuihua Yu and Charles Lieber of Harvard University, and Anyuan Cao of the University of Hawaii, US, used nitrogen gas to blow bubbles of an epoxy polymer containing silicon nanowires, single-walled carbon nanotubes or multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and caught the resulting film on a surface.\nThey then examined the resulting film under both optical and electron microscopes, revealing that the nanowires and nanotubes had become neatly lined up and evenly spread out across the surface.\nBubbles were produced by pouring the epoxy mixture over a metal plate with a gas inlet at the centre. Turning on the gas creates a bubble and a metal ring above the plate catches hold as it grows. As the bubble expands to more than 25cm wide and 50cm tall, portions of film are deposited on surrounding pieces of flat silicon or plastic.\nThe nanomaterials contained in the mixture were found to have aligned themselves vertically, towards the top of the bubble. Varying the concentration of tubes or wires in the mixture altered the density of nanomaterials but not their alignment.\nExactly why the tubes line up is not known, although the researchers suspect that stress generated on the surface of the bubble, as it expands, pulls the tubes and wires into line. They add that having a simple way to align nanowires and nanotubes with a particular density could help integrate such components into electronic and optical devices.\nTo prove this, the team created arrays of transistors using bubbles containing silicon nanowires. Electrodes and an additional layer of insulator were patterned onto a plate coated using the bubble technique to make many field effect transitors that exploit the semiconductor properties of the nanowires.\n\u201cMaterials scientists have spent the last decade dreaming of an effective and scalable method to fabricate high-performance nanocomposite films, only for these dreams to be, in general, ultimately deflated,\u201d the researchers write."}

However, Huistra thinks his less glamorous signings are proof of his exceptional eye for a player.\nRyan Kent has been a revelation since joining on loan from Gerrard\u2019s former club Liverpool and the capture of Connor Goldson from Brighton for \u00a33million in January is beginning to like a shrewd piece of business.\n\u201cGerrard has an excellent eye for talent,\u201d Huistra added. \u201cHe has brought in excellent players."}

John Bel Edwards and the Legislature are sifting through a long list of competing requests for new dollars, with college leaders, early childhood education advocates and agency chiefs among those vying for the cash.\nThree different pots of money are available after the state income forecasting panel boosted its projections: a $308 million surplus from the budget year that ended June 30, $110 million in unbudgeted money for the current year and $119 million in the financial year that begins July 1.\nThe Democratic governor and majority-GOP Legislature will decide how to spend the money in the ongoing two-month legislative session that must end June 6.\nEven when it was uncertain what agreement the governor and House Republican leaders would strike on the income forecast, both sides introduced budget proposals for the upcoming 2019-20 year that included a $1,000 raise for public school teachers and a $500 pay hike for school support workers, like custodians and teaching aides. Widespread support exists for the raises, though details of the salary increases still could change.\nAlso expected to win overwhelming backing are dollars to fill gaps in this year's budget for the TOPS college tuition program and the payments local sheriffs receive for housing state prisoners. Those programs often get late-year infusions of cash to cover costs.\nThe budget proposal filed by House Republican leaders, which is the measure lawmakers are advancing, doesn't contain enough money to keep TOPS students from facing cuts in assistance next year, but lawmakers appear likely to add that money, and Edwards supports the addition.\nRunning for a second term on the October ballot against two Republican challengers, Edwards wants spending increases in next year's budget for colleges, K-12 public education, the child welfare agency and juvenile justice programs. One of the larger items is a $39 million increase in block grant financing proposed for K-12 school districts.\nEdwards also offered plans for spending $80 million of this year's unbudgeted money. He wants to finish a computer system upgrade across agencies, repay FEMA for Louisiana's share of some disaster recovery costs and give more money to the corrections department. In higher education, he recommended increased spending to help schools facing accreditation reviews, offer more online resources to students and bolster university research and agricultural facilities.\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Cameron Henry, whose committee is the first stop for budget bills, joked that he's received requests that far outstrip available financing. The Jefferson Parish Republican said committee members want to continue \"working through the money agencies have before we decide about giving them more.\"\nSeveral lawmakers have suggested adding dollars for early childhood development programs, which Edwards didn't recommend for increases. Advocates are asking for $86 million annually to help children from birth to 3 years old with early learning assistance.\nSome Republicans argue that spending everything available on continuing programs will only boost Louisiana government costs long-term. GOP House Speaker Taylor Barras said: \"I would hope we don't spend it all.\"\nUnder Louisiana's constitution, surplus dollars can only be spent on one-time expenses, like debt payments, construction work and coastal projects, not ongoing agency expenses and continuing programs.\nAt least 10 percent of any surplus must pay down retirement debt, and a quarter of a surplus is earmarked for the state's \"rainy day\" fund.

{"idx": "22373", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The notional dollar value of stock repurchases by publicly held corporations has risen to its highest level since August 2015. The current rebound in stock prices has substantially benefited from a steady increase in stock buying by corporations such as Apple, Cisco, AbbVie, Boeing, Merck and Mastercard along with many others. The fuel for this buying power has come from the repatriation of profits held abroad and the tax form legislation which reduced the level of taxes on income from 35% to 21%, and increased the cash flow to pay for the buybacks.\nThese buybacks were not available during the panic selling spate earlier in February because companies are prohibited from to buying back their shares just prior to making public their earnings. The lack of that steady buying power together with computerized selling programs created several volatile selling sessions.\nFurther proof for the value of buybacks can be found in the performance of a Goldman Sachs index listed on Bloomberg (ticker:GSTHREPO) which was one of the best performing strategies in recent trading sessions, beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index by 50 basis points. It is important to note that many of the companies that have major share repurchasing plans have also raised their quarterly cash dividend rates, adding to the surge in their stock prices. Goldman Sachs estimates that the cash returned to shareholders in 2018 from stock buybacks and dividends will grow to $1 trillion. Repurchase authorizations have been strong, increasing at a rate of 18%. In fact, buybacks of common stocks will account for the largest share of US equity demand during 2018. It is powered by an extraordinarily high ratio of cash to assets on the part of the Standard & Poor's 500.\nIn facts valuations are rising because buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding while increasing per share earnings on the remaining stock outstanding.. While dividend increases means higher quarterly cash distributions on shareholdings. The combination is often an infallible plan for higher stock prices. In fact, these goals often take precedence over further capital expenditures of substantially higher compensation.\nApple has the dual benefit of corporate stock repurchases and the increased buying by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway of its now largest common stock position in the portfolio. Apple potentially has well over $100 billion in repatriated funds it could use to buyback its stock over the next several years.That would amount to more than 10 percent of its current market cap of $870 billion.\nIn recent days Cisco announced a $25 billion buyback together with a 14% hike in its cash dividend payout. AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company set a new $10 million repurchase plan. Boeing s going after $14 billion of stock, equal to 10% of its total shares outstanding. Merck and Oracle both have announced $10 billion buyback plans while Mastercard is going after $4 billion."}

Gossett, a resident of Hilton Head, S.C., spotted a black Porsche Carrera GT on eBay and bought it for the princely sum of $380,000.\nThis is not your average Porsche 911 or Boxster. The Carrera GT is the closest thing Porsche makes to a street-legal race car, with 605 hp, a 0-62 speed of 3.9 seconds, and a top speed of 205 mph. Porsche calls it a \"race-bred sports car\" outfitted with a carbon fiber chassis, a V10 engine, a six-speed racing gearbox, and a ceramic clutch.\nThe eBay seller was HBL, which operates the Porsche Tyson's Corner dealership in Virginia. Both Gossett and HBL agreed to substitute a silver Carrera GT for the black model, and it was delivered without incident to South Carolina.\nThat, according to the documents, was where the problems started. Gossett says he heard a knocking noise from the engine and took it to a local dealer, who said the engine would have to be lifted to diagnose the cause.\nFearing the value would be diminished, Gossett didn't want to do that and sued for breach of contract, breach of warranty, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, unfair trade practices, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and even more lawyerese that is, frankly, too lengthy for even Police Blotter to list in its entirety. In short, Gossett claimed, a car listed as \"new\" on eBay should have zero problems.\nThe United Auto Group (the successor to HBL as a result of a merger) asked the judge to dismiss the case based on lack of jurisdiction and also based on an arbitration clause in the purchase agreement.\nGossett claimed the arbitration clause should be unenforceable because the sale was complete at the time the eBay auction closed, but U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck referred the bulk of his claims to arbitration.\n\"When a arbitration agreement governed by the Federal Arbitration Act covers claims that have been asserted in a lawsuit, the court must compel arbitration and either dismiss the action or stay further judicial proceedings until the arbitration has been held.\n\"Courts have consistently interpreted this mandate broadly, addressing questions of arbitrability 'with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration...'\"\n\"The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied...UAG's motion to compel arbitration is granted.\""}

Sending probes to other planets, putting up space stations, astronauts walking and driving on the moon, the first flight of the space shuttle -- all this is something that exists in archival footage for me, as someone about to enter the fifth decade of his Earth-bound existence. The advances I am aware of happening are Voyager 2 going to the ice giant planets, the Hubble space telescope, and SpaceX landing and reusing rockets.\nIf you want an explanation for why the Falcon Heavy launch has been so welcomed, on a thoughtful level, it is due to the success of a rocket that is in the same ballpark of the vaunted Saturn V, and it is a step towards the BFR, which would be a true advance in space.\nOn a lowest common denominator level, it's a car floating in space, and it hardly comes more accessible than that. It's stupid, it's wasteful, but it is also fit for all ages.\nFor all the effort that governments put into getting children interested in science and technology subjects, a tacky stunt like a cherry-red Tesla shot out to the asteroid belt is probably more inspirational and helpful for getting kids excited than attempting to explain the pure science and difficulty in completing something like the New Horizons visit to Pluto.\nIt would be preferable, and the discussion about marketing stunts would be mute, if NASA had completed the task, but public money vacated the field decades ago, and since that time there have been a procession of US presidents making promises to NASA but delivering little.

We should learn from it.\nNot every cause emerges from such dramatic circumstances. With changing cultural norms and expanding historical knowledge comes a drive to revisit monuments to the past.\nIn 2007 and 2008, Sacramento activists successfully campaigned to remove the name of local philanthropist Charles M. Goethe from a middle school and a park in the city. The discussions were prompted by the research of Tony Platt, a historian then teaching at California State University, Sacramento, who uncovered writings by Goethe supporting white supremacy and the Nazis while working on a book about the eugenics movement.\nPlatt, now an affiliated scholar at UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for the Study of Law & Society, said people who engaged in horrific things were often elevated to folk heroes by political elites without any public deliberation. Revisiting who we choose to memorialize provides a more democratic opportunity to define ourselves as a society, he added.\nCalifornia is increasingly undertaking those debates, though many remain highly controversial.\nResidents in Fort Bragg, the small Mendocino County community, have pushed back firmly against recent requests from some lawmakers that the town rename itself. Originally a 19th-century Army outpost named for officer Braxton Bragg, who later became a Confederate general, Fort Bragg officials argue the connection is too tenuous to matter.\nA resolution recommending that California replace a statue in Congress of Father Junipero Serra with one of astronaut Sally Ride passed the state Senate this spring, but was pulled ahead of the pope\u2019s scheduled U.S. visit this fall to canonize Serra. Despite criticisms of Serra and his impending sainthood because of the treatment American Indians received in the string of California missions he founded, opponents called the resolution an insult to Catholics.\nYou won\u2019t find a flawless leader.\nAssembly Bill 30, which would require a handful of California high schools to ditch their \u201cRedskins\u201d mascots, has been working its way through the Legislature this session. Tied to a national effort, aimed at the Washington football team, by American Indian groups who find the term offensive, AB 30 has received opposition at every stage from those who counter that the mascot is a sign of respect. A parallel movement to remove the slur \u201csquaw\u201d from place names, which began with a Minnesota law in 1995 and has since spread to other states, has never gained much traction in California.\nThe response can vary by community. Opponents often object to these efforts as an attack on history \u2013 political correctness run amok"}

The Eagles have a need at defensive tackle, especially if they move on from Timmy Jernigan.\nSanu is one of the better slot receivers in the NFL, which only becomes a need for the Eagles if they move on from Nelson Agholor.

The original two bedrooms and a bath sat behind that.\nPlus, in the 1950s, a homeowner had added a master bedroom and bathroom behind the two bedrooms, and to the rear of those a den, all reached via a long, narrow hallway that ran unimaginatively through the center of the house.\nBut the Kirkpatricks possess minds made flexible by their work--she's an interior designer, he's an architect--and saw that the rooms could be flipped around under the long pitched roof. The kitchen would be switched to the rear of the house, laid open to the den and, through a wall of glass doors and windows, the backyard.\nThen the master bedroom could be relocated to the front of the house, where the living room once sat, with the master bathroom inserted into the original kitchen space.\nAlso, the garage was at the back of the property, again in typical 1940s style, with the driveway running right past the house, which is not what many 1990s couples want. Noting an alley behind the property, the Kirkpatricks realized they could essentially flip the garage around by transferring the garage door to the rear.\n\"We started sketching right away,\" Shaya said. \"It was obvious to us. Our friends just started laughing. They couldn't see it.\"\n\"We call it the pancake house,\" said Grant, also 35. \"The house that flipped over.\"\nTaking on the challenge of flip-flopping a house was worthwhile for the couple, who wanted to live in the \"tree section\" of Manhattan Beach (so-called for its eucalyptus, acacia, palm and jacaranda population), and benefit from its low crime rate, easy walk to the downtown area, and excellent schools for sons Jack, 4, and Ryan, 1. Plus, it's not too far from Grant's Santa Monica office.\nAfter purchasing the house in 1997 for $420,000, the couple decided to put about $100,000 into the remodel. The first step, of course, was to contemplate and completely plan the remodel before construction began.\nAccording to Grant, homeowners have overblown expectations of what they can get for their money. Being in the business, the Kirkpatricks knew well the high cost of materials and labor.\nHomeowners also tend not to plan the project thoroughly enough, Grant said, and this forces them to make decisions at the last minute--during construction, and under enormous stress and pressure. This was not what Grant and Shaya wanted.\nAnother goal was to experiment. For instance, because many of the couple's clients want dark kitchen cabinets and light floors, the couple at first specified just that--cherry-stained cabinets and light maple floors for the kitchen-great room. To try something new, however, they switched to white painted cabinets and laminate floors that look like dark wood.\nThe laminate floors, which are much more durable than wood, were chosen to stand up to the \"rug rats'"}

{"idx": "22386", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: How often have you had the frustrating experience of receiving a tax demand on account of the fact that credit has not been given for the entire amount of tax deducted at source (TDS) from your income? Earlier, this was not so much of a problem as you had to file physical certificates of TDS from your income and credit was given on the basis of such certificates. However, with the computerization of the tax information network (TIN), credit for TDS is given on the basis of information filed with the TIN in the form of quarterly statements by tax deductors.\nVery often, the bank or the other person deducting tax at source from your income either does not mention your PAN in the quarterly statement of tax deduction that it files, or makes an error in entering your PAN. In such a situation, the only remedy that you have is to approach the deductor, point out that the tax deducted at source by him is not reflected against your PAN and request him to file a revised statement after correcting your PAN. Again, this is a Herculean task in most cases, particularly if you are dealing with a large bank, which has thousands of customers. More often than not, the bank or another deductor merely gives you an assurance that it will do so, but does not bother to make the necessary corrections. Unfortunately, you have no power to ensure that the deductor rectifies its mistake and accordingly you then have to request your income-tax officer to carry out the rectification on the basis of the tax deduction certificate given by the tax deductor.\nThe problem was more acute in cases where the investment was made in one name, but the whole income was taxable in the hands of another person. For instance, income of minor children is clubbed with the income of the parent, income of a trust may be taxable in the hands of the beneficiary, income received in the name of a partner may be taxed as the income of the partnership firm and so on. The problem was also acute where the entire income was received by one person, but only a part of the income was taxable as his income, the remaining being taxable in the hands of others. For instance, where a property which is jointly owned is let out, the rent may be received by only the first holder for convenience, but would be taxable as income of the joint owners in the proportion of their respective holding of the property. In all these cases, the PAN number of the person to whom payments were being made would have been mentioned in the tax deduction certificate, and would be reflected in their form 26AS alone. The person who was ultimately taxable in respect of such income was not getting credit for the TDS, while the person in whose name the TDS certificate was issued would get credit only for the proportionate TDS in relation to the income offered for tax by him.\nFortunately, the rules (rule 37BA) have been amended to provide that in all such cases, the person who will be receiving the income should file a declaration with the payer of the income, stating that such income is taxable as the income of the specified persons who are supposed to be taxed on such income. There is no specific form prescribed for such declaration. Though the rule does not require it, the PAN and address of such other persons should be given with their respective shares of income. The payer of the income is then required to give details of such other persons in his TDS quarterly return, and such TDS will then be reflected in their respective form 26AS.\nIf you have fixed deposits of your minor children with a bank, interest on which is subject to TDS, and the"}

Regarding this gas issue you're talking about, whoever said that exporting gas to enemy combatants, Jews or otherwise, is impermissible? Who among the Muslim jurists [fuqaha] said this?

So, show me one jurist saying that it is impermissible to deal with enemy combatants\u2014I do not say treaty-holders, as there is a treaty between us and the Jews, but I posit that between us and the Jews is war.

In addition, BridgeBio announced that it was launching a new subsidiary, Origin Biosciences, with sufficient capital to support clinical development of ALXN1101 through potential regulatory approval and commercialization.\nMoCD is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism. The disease is caused by a mutation in the MOCS1 gene and leads to defective production of cPMP. Clinical signs of MoCD present shortly after birth and progress rapidly. Newborns with MoCD experience difficulty feeding and intractable seizures yet have no approved available therapies. Patients have a median survival of three years, and those who survive often have severe and irreversible injury to their central nervous system.\n\"Historically, replacing missing or defective proteins has proven highly efficacious for treating loss of function monogenic conditions \u2013 in the case of MoCD type A, we are replacing the missing or defective cPMP, providing children with much needed MoCD activity,\" said Michael Henderson, M.D., senior vice president of asset acquisition at BridgeBio. \"BridgeBio's team is committed to continuing the development of ALXN1101 for infants born with MoCD Type A deficiency, their families and caregivers.\"\nALXN1101 is a synthetic version of cPMP, the missing cofactor causing MoCD Type A. In previous work with a recombinant form of cPMP, 11 patients with MoCD Type A had normalization of biomarkers within two days, eight patients showed some suppression of seizures, and three patients had near-normal development. ALXN1101 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the US FDA.\n\"Patients born with MoCD face a bleak future, and we will do all we can to pursue the development of this exciting compound, which has the potential to replace the missing enzyme,\" said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., CEO of BridgeBio. \"BridgeBio aims to sustainably pursue even the rarest of diseases, such as MoCD, especially where we can support drug programs that target well described genetic diseases at their source.\"\nWhile specific terms of the deal have not been disclosed, BridgeBio has committed sufficient resources to Origin Biosciences to enable clinical development, regulatory approval and to support commercialization of ALXN1101.

Barney Zwartz reports on the battle looming.\nTHE PROBLEM crept under Muriel Porter's radar. The first the veteran Anglican women's activist noticed, it was at last year's Melbourne synod when a minister proposed a motion about the need to attract young men to church.\nAnglican priests are ordained at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Muriel Porter (top) and Hannah Craven.\nSomeone else moved to add \"and young women\"\u2014and it was defeated.\nThen she began hearing uncomfortable stories about young women being told they were defying God in wanting to become priests, that it was a role reserved for men, that the \"headship\" teaching (which says women must be subordinate to men) was on the march.\nWomen were being discouraged, even intimidated.\nPorter was shocked. For decades Melbourne had been the diocese most supportive of women priests, and the issue seemed long resolved.\nBut now, in the Anglican Church and in others, it seems to be a divisive issue once again, with a backlash unleashed and gaining ground.\nThe question is broader than whether women can be priests and exercise leadership over men, though that is usually how it is framed inside the church.\nhome, where the once-traditional idea that they should submit to their husbands is gaining fresh traction.\nThis is being re-examined in churches around Australia: Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal and others.\nPorter says the change in Melbourne and elsewhere is due to a rising number of hard-line young Melbourne ministers who are strongly influenced by resurgent conservatism in the United States.\nShe says they are \"very masculine and horrified by what they call the 'chickification' of Christianity\".\nAccording to Kevin Giles, a Melbourne evangelical minister and veteran of the fight for women's equality within the church, the issue is \"about power\u2014who has it and who doesn't, who determines how the Scriptures should be read\".\nThose who support the \"headship\" doctrine are called complementarians.\nThey say women and men are created equal in value but with different roles, in which leadership is reserved for men.\nThe biblical text they rely on is Paul's first letter to Timothy, which says: \"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man; she must be silent.\"\nThe pro-equality group argues that these verses have a specific context and are not a permanent mandate. They rely on texts such as Paul's letter to the Galatians: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ.\"\nThis group, who call themselves egalitarians, argue that ministry is based on abilities and not gender.\nAccording to Giles, the debate is not about whether women can \"minister\".\nHe says: \"Everyone is in favour of women's ministry, because that can be anything\u2014even making tea. The real key is leadership, headship. The debate is full of code words, but unpacked it means men lead, women obey.\"\nGiles and his wife, Lynley, a noted marriage educator, are sufficiently concerned that they have organised the annual international conference of Christians for Biblical Equality in Melbourne this weekend.\nFounded in the US in 1988, the group claims it has members from 1"}

The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.\nThen, two years ago, the student organization I worked for at Vanderbilt University got kicked off campus for being the wrong kind of Christians.\nIn May 2011, Vanderbilt's director of religious life told me that the group I'd helped lead for two years, Graduate Christian Fellowship\u2014a chapter of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship\u2014was on probation. We had to drop the requirement that student leaders affirm our doctrinal and purpose statement, or we would lose our status as a registered student organization.\nI met with him to understand the change. During the previous school year, a Christian fraternity had expelled several students for violating their behavior policy. One student said he was ousted because he is gay. Vanderbilt responded by forbidding any belief standards for those wanting to join or lead any campus group.\nSeptember 2014, Vol. 58, No. 7, Pg 54, \"The Wrong Kind of Christian\""}

Sixty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed, in addition to three civilians inside Israel. We are joined from Gaza City by Raji Sourani, one of the top advocates for Palestinian human rights in the Occupied Territories. The director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza, Sourani serves on the executive board of the International Federation for Human Rights. He is a past winner of the Right Livelihood Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go back right now to Raji Sourani. Raji, the significance of the ceasefire being over? You just heard Mohammed Omer talking about the warning to the hospital that it\u2019s about to be attacked in Rafah, the Abu Youssef Hospital. You\u2019re a human rights lawyer.\nRAJI SOURANI: Israel, all the time, in the last 24 days, they targeted hospitals and UNRWA facilities, where refugees are there. And hospitals, precisely, they bombed it. I mean Shuhada al-Aqsa. They bombed al-Wafa Hospital, as well. As a result of these bombings, there was killings, injuries. Even operation theaters has been hit direct, I mean, these hospitals. So that\u2019s not, I mean, unique or special. They are, in a very deliberate, intentional way, targeting even the hospitals. And they kill people inside it, around it.\nNo safe haven in Gaza. No holy thing in Gaza. Everything is obscene. Israel is practicing, in very simple words, rule of jungle against civilians, against hospitals, against schools of UNRWA, against electricity station\u2014what are, in the eye of the storm in Gaza, civilians and civilian targets, obviously. It\u2019s very clear. Whenever the resistance hit the army and they have losses, they revenge deliberately by bombarding, killing civilians. This is, I mean, very basic, fundamental conclusion. Any who is living in Gaza can feel it, can see it and watch it, every hour, every day.\nAnd in Rafah, all this bombing for people of Rafah happened immediately after the resistance engaged and they kidnapped one of the Israeli officers there. They can target and they have the right to target the resistance group. We are not in defense of resistance group. They are for that, and they can defend themselves. Why we are here as a human rights organizations, to defend civilians at the time of war, not peace. And civilians, once and again, are the target of the most strongest fifth army on Earth, with all high tech they are using. This is a shame, shame for army and the state do such policy and such a practice. It\u2019s shame for states who license and give them the license to kill, by giving them political approvement, endorsement for doing what they are doing in this part of the world. All what we are asking, seeking protection for civilians at a time of war. That\u2019s why international law, international humanitarian law, is there, to protect civilians at a time of war.

Hans argues great success never comes without a set of failures. \u201cStruggle is the part of the story where it\u2019s about to get good. This is why movies have these kinds of climaxes to them. Struggle and loss are usually the precursor to success,\u201d she says.\nStruggle is the part of the story where it\u2019s about to get good.\nThere are plenty of reasons why loss, disappointment, and disasters can bring out the best in us and lead us to the success we seek.\n\u201cWhen you go through the worst, you no longer fear the worst,\u201d says Hans, who argues that confidence is the key ingredient to success. \u201cWe achieve success by believing that we can. When you\u2019ve been through the worst, you no longer fear, and fear is really what prevents people from being confident,\u201d she says.\nJust as a muscle grows stronger when you lift weights, causing minor tears and repairs in the muscle, self-confidence works in the same way. The more loss, disappointment, and tragedy you go through, the stronger that muscle becomes and the more you will be able to believe in yourself to accomplish even more.\nResiliency is a key indicator of success, according to Hans. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t go through hardships, they remain weak and fragile,\u201d she says. Once you face failure, rejection, or any sort of hardship, you\u2019re forced to ask yourself how you can use this negative thing to move forward.\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked in sales, for example, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve faced numerous rejections. If you allowed those rejections to paralyze you, it\u2019s unlikely you have stayed in a sales career. If, however, you have become a successful salesperson, it\u2019s likely that you asked yourself after each rejection what you could have done differently and improved your technique at the next opportunity.\nFailure is a good way to test how badly you want success. \u201cIf you quit after disappointment, you may not want it badly enough,\u201d says Hans. If, after experiencing many losses and disappointments, you continue to strive toward your end goal, however, that\u2019s a good sign that you really want this goal."}

The true believer notes that the songwriter, Mr. Newman, is an atheist and commonist, who creates one-dimensional religious straw men as objects of ridicule.

When we finally came to his little corner of this building, I read the sign on the door: Todd Altschuler, Philosophical Investigation Agency.\nI took a seat at a square wooden table with bench seats. It was the only furniture of the sparsely decorated office, aside from a long vertical shelf with carefully stacked volumes of philosophy by Hegel, Heidegger, Nietzsche. The man sat at the opposite end of the small table, paused for a second to let the loud sound of a train running overhead pass, then said simple: \"What\u2019s on your mind?\".\nI asked what he did. Todd described the following: that instead of locating missing wives or cracking unsolved crimes, he deals with missing souls and unsolved philosophical problems. He helps people to find their ideas again.\nTodd said he had taught philosophy in universities for fifteen years. He loved it. The problem was that philosophy departments were in a downward spiral, so he decided to see if philosophy could live somewhere else.\nWhat kind of cases does he take on? He said that he had done work for big tech firms in Silicon Valley. \"I help them to get their thoughts straighten out their thoughts. For instance, I helped a director at one tech firm find the missing logic in her division\u2019s strategy. It meant that her ideas were sound and couldn\u2019t be picked apart during a high stakes presentation\".\nCould he give another example? \"Well, I\u2019ve also been working with artists. They are now expected to write about their work. Often, where success is concerned, the description is almost as important as the work. I help them to locate words to wrap around their work, and convey who they are as creators so they can communicate all this with collectors.\"\nI was beginning to get a sense of what philosophical investigation entailed, but I wanted to know more. How was this process any different from therapy? \"Well, therapists work on your relationship and your emotions. I don\u2019t. I just focus on trying to get your ideas clear\". So it's coaching, then? \"Coaches are about changing what you do. I just focus on how you think.\"\nAnother train rattled by overhead, leaving a lull in conversation.

For you, being lonely is a negative thing. But loneliness can create a kind of clearing in your life. It\u2019s a space where new projects can grow. It\u2019s not just an unpleasant feeling.

To find out how this technology unravelled the biggest news story of the decade so far, we spoke to ICIJ's data editor, Mar Cabra.\nZDNet: Is your background in journalism?\nCabra: Yes, I am a trained journalist. I was a TV journalist at first and did various work including as a TV journalist here in Manchester. I worked for CNN plus in Spain and for network news there.\nBut then I realised that I didn't quite fit into the fast-paced news line and so I went to university in New York and specialised in investigative journalism. It was there that I discovered data journalism and how data can be used to create systematic stories. And then from data journalism, I started to work with developers and that is how I got into the ICIJ and started to do investigative reports. I have been head of investigative reports there since 2014.\nQ: How do you set about developing stories based on data?\nWith the Panama Papers, our colleagues at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung got this large leak of 2.6 terabytes of data and they came to us and said, 'Hey, we can't possibly analyse all this, let's get a team together'.\nMy team spent a good couple of months looking into the data to look first at how we could tackle this dataset. By that I mean a combination of data and documents. So we started by saying, 'let's process these documents and then see what sort of analysis we can perform and then see what the story is'.\nICIJ's Cabra: \"One of our core questions is, 'can we speak about this systematically?'\"\nSometimes we have a problem that has data in it and we try to figure out how to solve it. Other times it is different, for example we did something on the World Bank. One of our investigative reporters picked up something from sources that suggested that the World Bank was financing development projects all around the world that were displacing people, either economically or physically, and this was a widespread problem.\nWe looked into it and it did seem to be a problem, so our next step was to ask: How can we quantify this problem so that we can talk about it from a systematic perspective? What are the data sources? How can we tackle this? How can we deal with this as a systematic problem?\nAt ICIJ we always try to establish three criteria when dealing with a topic. And we only deal with two or three problems a year so the questions are very important.\nThe three questions are: Is it of a global concern? Are we dealing with a system that is broken? And, are we likely to get a result?\nAs you can see, one of our core"}

{"idx": "22431", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Thanks to Facebook and other social media channels, the Nestle Company has an enormous public relations mess on their hands. The question is, can they further use social media to fix the problem? Other downtrodden companies such as Toyota and various airlines are embracing social media channels in hopes of repairing their current poor image. Unfortunately, Nestle\u2019s social media embrace is being more than spurned by consumers; it\u2019s also drawing large quantities of vitriolic comments, viral video parodies, animated parodies of the company\u2019s reaction to the reaction, and so on.\nThe gist of the situation is that environmental protection group Greenpeace, who are known for their unorthodox and sometimes heavy-handed ways of bringing attention, created a parody video (but it\u2019s somewhat gory, not funny) on YouTube of Nestle\u2019s KitKat candy bar product. The video suggests that the production of a key ingredient, palm oil, helps further the destruction of rainforests, which in turn threatens endangered species such as the Orangutan. Greenpeace says that the Paradise Forests in Sumatra in particular are suffering a record-breaking deforestation rate.\nNestle reacted by requesting that youTube take it down. Viewer comments suggest that it was taken down, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the video from reappearing on multiple video sharing sites, in multiple copies. This sharing of the video is making it go viral.\nIn addition to the Greenpeace video, there\u2019s an animated parody of Nestle\u2019s reaction. In it, two animated characters (using xtranormal.com\u2019s web software) pretend to be Nestle employees and talk about how they\u2019ll get the Greenpeace video removed by citing copyright violation. (In truth, their trademark has been used in the Greenpeace video without permission, so this isn\u2019t really a copyright issue, as far as I know.) Now, there are parody logos popping up that look like Nestle\u2019s KitKat(tm) packaging but replace the brand name with the word \u201ckiller\u201d.\nNow if that\u2019s not enough for Nestle, consumers are attacking them on their Facebook Page. The 140+-year-old Swiss-based company\u2019s Page may have over 93K fans (at this writing), and some may be legit, but many people are joining just to voice their opposition, reminding people of past Nestle controversies, namely their breast milk substitutes. CNET\u2019s The Social blog has a screen snap of the past comments on the Nestle Facebook Page.\nWith an increasing number of companies using social media, especially Facebook Fan Pages, to interact with consumers, it\u2019s important to get it right. There\u2019s an obvious lesson here for companies: if you do something wrong and people attack you in social media, being defensive gets you nowhere. There might be a lot of apathy about many important worldwide concerns, including the environment, but the social media makes it easy for those who like to be vocal to actually be vocal and instigate concern. Grassroots movements even inspire efforts such as CO2 Neutral Profile, a Facebook application that lets users neutralize their carbon emissions said to be generated from daily use of Facebook. Once grassroots concern goes viral, social media can turn anti-social as far as your business is concerned."}

{"idx": "22435", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: An LLC is treated as a pass-through entity by default by the IRS unless the owners, known as members, elect to be treated as a corporation. A pass-through entity does not pay taxes on its profits at the business level. Instead, it passes a proportionate share of profits and losses through to its members, who then record their share on personal income tax returns and pay taxes on the share at an individual rate. Distributions, or payments, of excess profits made to members of an LLC are constrained by the company's status as a pass-through entity.\nLLCs make two types of payments to members: draws and distributions. Draws can be taken at any time and are an advance on expected profits that would be allocated to the member at the end of the year. Draws are typically not guaranteed, unless the member manages the business and the draw is used as the member's salary. Since the LLC is a pass-through entity, the members are not considered employees of the business in the way they would be if the business was organized as a corporation.\nGuaranteed draws are used as a substitute for a salary and ensure that a member that is running the day-to-day operations of the company is compensated for his services before other members receive payments out of profits. The other type of payment \u2013 distributions \u2013 is distributed at year-end and is a member's proportionate share of the company's profits.\nA guaranteed draw, or payment, is used as the LLC equivalent of salary to managing members. This type of payment has certain tax benefits. The IRS treats guaranteed draws as wages and requires members to pay self-employment taxes and make estimated tax payments. The managing member must pay the full amount of the employment tax \u2013 the employer and employee amounts that, together, total approximately 15.3 percent in 2018 \u2013 but gets to deduct half of that amount from his adjusted gross income as a business expense.\nA managing member who receives part of company revenue as a guaranteed draw or payment only ends up paying approximately 7 percent taxes, or half the amount of the employment tax rate, on the amount. Because the IRS considers the managing member active in the daily business of the LLC, it allows a deduction of half the employment taxes on the managing member's tax return. If the payment had been paid to him at the end of the year as a distribution, for example, he would have had to pay taxes on it at his individual income tax rate rate, which in some cases can be as high as 28 percent. Most LLC members view the lower tax rate applicable to guaranteed draws treated as wages as a significant benefit.\nMasters, Terry. \"Tax Benefits of Guaranteed Payments in an LLC.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-benefits-guaranteed-payments-llc-19208.html. 20 March 2019."}

Pressure on companies has been building since the UN warned last year that the world has only 12 years to avert a climate disaster.\nThe oil giant was first threatened with a lawsuit last year by the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth. Greenpeace and ActionAid joined the initiative on Tuesday, along with four other groups.\nShell, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has said it \"strongly supports\" the Paris agreement. It has committed to halving the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050.\nBut the climate activists argue that its fossil fuel activities are inconsistent with the document signed by nearly all of the world's governments in Paris in 2015.\n\"The company has no concrete plans to align its business strategy with the commitments contained in the agreement,\" Joris Thijssen, the director of Greenpeace Netherlands, said in a statement.\nThe legal action threatened by the groups would seek to establish that Shell is responsible under Dutch law for its contributions to climate change and for associated environmental damage.\nThe activists are hoping to obtain a court ruling that would force Shell to make a major shift toward renewable energy.\nShell last year rejected changes to its business demanded by Friends of the Earth.

But the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) says it and Sierra Leoneans in general are disappointed with the way the country is being run under President Koroma.\nJacob Jusu Saffa is the National Secretary General of the SLPP. He told VOA Sierra Leoneans are worried because the factors that led to the country\u2019s brutal civil war from 1991 to 2002 are again being repeated by the Koroma government.\n\u201cThe SLPP and the entire nation are disappointed with the way things are being managed in the country. We are worried because the factors that led to the war in 1991 seem to be repeated by this same government. For several reasons, one of them is the growing marginalization of people who are not perceived to be supporters of the APC, particularly people in the south and east. There is clear evidence of summary dismissals of public officials,\u201d he said.\nSaffa also accused the Koroma government of politicizing state institutions and doing little to ease the rising cost of food.\n\u201cVery recently, ex-combatants who were bodyguards to the president are being recruiting in the police without going through the proper procedures as stated in the Police Act. They are now personal security to the president. We also have clear evidence of corruption, particularly in the area of procurement, and of course the food crisis,\u201d Saffa said.\nCurrent Sierra Leone Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana told VOA in an interview last month that the opposition was playing politics with its accusation that the government was doing nothing to control the rising cost of living.\nBut Saffa said the Koroma government has failed to prioritize its agenda.\n\u201cGovernance is a scientific process that involves policy choices. In the case of the food crisis, granted it\u2019s a global problem, but what we are saying here is that people are not only worried about the fact that there is no food today, they are even more worried about the fact that even tomorrow and next year there\u2019s not going to be food because this same government reduced the budget allocation to the ministry of agriculture from about five to six percent of the budget to something less than two percent. So it\u2019s not about politics. It\u2019s about prioritization,\u201d Saffa said.\nHe brushed aside as mere political rhetoric the Koroma government\u2019s promise to alleviate future shortages of rice by focusing on mechanized agriculture and doing away with the importation of rice by the year 2010.\n\u201cThey are not doing the investment in that sector to ensure that output in the year 2010. Over $1 million US has been spent on overseas travel only for the president. And virtually every ministry has exhausted its budget allocated for the year for traveling in just one quarter. Which type of leadership are we seeing? Is it leadership by example?\u201d he said.\nVice President Sumana also said unlike the SLPP-led government when Freetown, the capital was always in blackout, the Koroma government was been able to bring electricity to the capital on a constant basis.\nBut Saffa said the government\u2019s claim of constant electricity supply to Freetown was misleading.\n\u201cVery few areas in Freetown enjoy electricity up to 10 to 12 hours a day.

Movement conservatives broadly oppose the idea of taxing wealthy people to subsidize the lower and middle classes. They don't like regulating the private sector very much either. Add in the political incentives they faced to uniformly oppose President Obama's agenda, the zero Republican votes for the Affordable Care Act, and you've planted seeds of lasting hostility.\nBut the hostility has become so deeply rooted that it now stands on its own, detached from the ideological and partisan antipathies that gave rise to it.\nIt has forced conservatives to blind themselves to the law's positive, unobjectionable qualities, and police those within their ranks who dare to acknowledge them.\nTalking Points Memo's Josh Marshall called this reactionary phenomenon Obamacare McCarthyism. It ensnared Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who's running for Senate in 2014 and had the temerity to suggest that Republicans shouldn't just idly mock the law when it stumbles. A few years ago, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wy0., said he liked the concept of insurance exchanges -- which are crucial components of GOP-backed Medicare privatization proposals and other conservative reform ideas -- and now a hardline super PAC is using his words against him, as if he'd called for the creation of a public option.\nBut on the battlefields of partisan warfare, this sort of post-principled contempt, combined with the inception of benefits, has turned the fight over Obamacare from a dispute over first principles, into a culture war, in which signaling matters more than tactical victories.\nThe repeal campaign -- once marked by earnest and sustained efforts to wipe the law off the books -- has all but burned itself out. But the law remains a potent political organizing force -- a rallying cry Republicans believe they can use to channel the right's Obamacare obsession into voter turnout.\nAn astute friend remarked to me on Tuesday that the GOP's position on Obamacare is coming to resemble its position on abortion in one key way: loudly, consistently, uniformly opposed, but ultimately not really driven to eliminate it. The backlash they'd face would be brutal, but they might stand to gain by fighting it on the margins and keeping the issue alive.\nThe comparison holds at a state level too. The most effective Obamacare saboteurs have been GOP governors and legislatures who resisted the opportunity to create their own exchanges and have refused to expand Medicaid with federal dollars, as the law allows.\nMore generally, conservatives are wielding Obamacare the way they wielded culture war issues in the 1990s. The particulars are enormously different, but the political objectives are similar: pick an issue that both unites conservative voters and appeals to the discontent of moderates and use it first and foremost to fracture the Democratic coalition.\nI don't think they're going to fracture the Democratic coalition. But I can imagine the issue remaining an effective mobilizing tool for an otherwise agenda-less party through the end of Obama's presidency.\nOf course, the culture wars of the '90s didn't all unfold the same way. Abortion and gun rights have proven to be more durable polarizing tools than immigration and gay rights.\nMy suspicion is that over time, as Affordable Care Act beneficiaries become"}

But these moves were partially offset by reductions elsewhere.\nIn Venezuela, oil exports have plunged by 40% to about 920,000 bpd since the US government slapped sanctions on its petroleum industry on January 28. The drop comes as Opec, of which Venezuela is a founding member, leads efforts to withhold about 1.2-million bpd of supply to prop up prices. Venezuela is exempt from the cuts.\n\u201cOpec and its 10 allies are doing their job and this time they are stubborn,\u201d London-based brokerage PVM said in a note, referring to the supply restrictions that have been in place since the start of the year.\nOn the demand side, a Reuters poll showed analysts expect global fuel demand to slow this year amid a broad economic slowdown.\nChina\u2019s February factory activity fell for a third month as the world\u2019s second-largest economy continued to struggle with weak export orders, a private survey showed on Friday. The weakness is also being felt across the wider region. South Korea\u2019s exports contracted at their steepest pace in nearly three years in February as demand from China cooled further.\nDespite this, fuel consumption, especially in Asia\u2019s developing economies ,which are key drivers of global oil demand, is, so far, holding up.

The man, born a woman, has undergone gender altering surgery since 1998, but was blocked from receiving further treatment by Lithuanian law. The man also complained that despite having had numerous treatments, including hormonal treatment and breast removal surgery, he was still considered a woman in official documents. The court ruled that Lithuania must change its legislation within three months or be forced to pay the man as much as 40,000 euros in damages.\nIn its latest democracy index, the British-based Economist magazine's research unit ranked Lithuania 39th out of 167 states, which puts it into the category of \"flawed democracy.\" Latvia and Estonia came in at at 43rd and 33rd, respectively.

It should be noted that we do get the unarmed damage tables for small and large PCs \u2013 kudos there!\nThe class is defined by the forms. Forms can be considered to be martial arts that either are extraordinary or supernatural abilities. They sport three defining components: Focus required denotes the minimum number of focus required to perform the form. Focus Change specifies how the performing of the form changes the focus points. Costs are paid up front, gained focus is awarded after performing the form. The Element, finally, denotes the subtype of the form. Masters of forms begin play with 3 forms and gain +1 form every level thereafter. DCs usually are 10 + 1/2 class level + Charisma modifier and unless otherwise noted, the master of forms can only perform one form per round.\nI mentioned the focus pool in the above explanation: The maximum number of focus points in the pool is equal to 4. The pool begins empty and does not refresh simply by resting. Instead, executing certain forms increases or decreases the focus pool. Focus points can only be regained in combat and last only for Charisma modifier minutes outside of combat. While this can be inefficiently be kitten\u2019d, the short duration means that it\u2019s not a good strategy. The master of forms automatically learns certain basic, universal forms: These are gained at 1st level, +1 every 3 levels thereafter. Basically, you can picture these as the \u201cminimum-functionality\u201d-framework that prevents inexperienced players from locking themselves into a situation, where they can\u2019t gain focus \u2013 the most basic of these forms, for example, allows you to substitute a regular attack in a full-attack-sequence or use a standard action for an attack that deals regular damage + 1/2 Cha-mod (full Cha-mod starting 6th level) and nets you +1 focus.\nAt 4th level, for -1 focus, as a swift action, the master of forms can self-buff with minor luck bonuses, while 7th level provides a means for ending an elemental stance and immediately starting a new one as a move action. (As a swift action at 19th level, they can also end it, but gain focus and still be allowed to enter a second stance.). Level 10 provides temporary flight (YES \u2013 non-combat utility!) and higher levels sport save-bonuses. I already mentioned elemental stances, so let me elaborate a bit there: Universal forms have no element and thus do not disrupt active stances, though they do break the sequence required to activate an elemental stance.\nAll right, so what\u2019s the deal with stances? Well, whenever a master of forms performs three consecutive forms belonging to the same element, they enter"}

It got me thinking about all the ways I use water in my daily life and there\u2019s a lot! Can you imagine our resources drying up? Colorado and Summit County are quickly growing. How will there be enough?\nLaura, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re interested in conserving water. Imagine a Day Without Water, Oct. 10, is a great chance for everyone to stop and think about how much water they use and even cut back in some areas. It can get us all thinking in a good way \u2014 a way that helps conserve our increasingly scarce water resources here in the dry West.\nDid you know that by 2050 our water resources in the Blue River watershed are expected to be some 15 billion gallons short every year? That means there won\u2019t be as much water from the Blue River to be diverted to the Front Range or sent downstream via the Colorado River to other Western states. That\u2019s because we\u2019re using too much of what we have.\nI think we all understand that water is essential and sometimes we take it for granted. I recently decided to challenge myself by really thinking hard about everything I did in a single day that involved water. Let me tell you what I discovered.\nI woke up and brushed my teeth then brewed some fresh coffee. I savored my robust blend while I cooked my favorite breakfast \u2014 eggs benedict with some fruit on the side. It was a Sunday morning, after all. I immediately realized that without water, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to brush my teeth or poach the eggs. Then I paused and thought about the water needed to produce the fruit and the coffee beans, and even to brew the coffee.\nNext, I went down to Lake Dillon to kayak. It\u2019s something I like to do on a foggy weekend morning, and it was foggy. As I paddled around I began to think about how fortunate we are to live in such a beautiful place as Summit County, and to enjoy recreating so close to home in the water, on the snow, hiking along a creek, you name it. Most of these things are pure water, even the fog that I was enjoying in the cool morning air.\nSoon, the sun came out to burn off the fog and warm things up a bit. It was time to meet up with some friends at a local brewery. We enjoyed the weather and a few brews \u2014 my favorite social pastime, but alas! Not possible with no water. Beer needs water to grow grains and hops, and of course to brew. I don\u2019t know how I would fare without my two favorite beverages \u2014 coffee and beer.\nI decided I should look into the issue further. I thought about all the infrastructure needed to bring the water to me. Pipes lead from each water source to every building around us, and then inside each building there are lots of smaller pipes. The United States Geological Survey estimates that each person in the U.S. uses 80 to 100 gallons of water daily in their home.\nMany people aren\u2019t aware that water is needed to produce most electricity. I\u2019m not talking about hydroelectric power (which obviously uses water). I\u2019m referring to the sources where we still get the majority of our electricity \u2014 coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants. The water is used in cooling and heating processes to produce the power. The smoke you see coming from these plants is usually steam, actually.\nIn fact, almost 40 percent of the freshwater we use in the U.S. is for electricity production. Let me give you an idea of just how much this is. Upwards of"}

This project seeks to promote a greater sense of community among students, staff, and faculty by creating a common experience (that of reading the same book) among campus members. The book, \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,\" by Anne Fadiman, explores the conflict between medical professionals in Merced, California and a Hmong family over the care of their daughter, Lia Lee. Lia is diagnosed with severe epilepsy and both her parents and her doctors wanted the best for Lia, but the lack of understanding between them resulted in tragedy.\nThis book was chosen for several reasons. First, the book offers our campus an opportunity to engage in a rich dialogue on how to foster mutual respect in a multicultural environment. Secondly, the text has broad appeal and application to a variety of disciplines, such as medicine, communication, political science, history, cultural studies, sociology and education. Finally, the story takes place within the medical community of UC Davis, namely the Merced Community Medical Center and, therefore, the events and experiences relate directly to our institution.\nWe invite all members of our community - undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty, and administrators - to read the book, and to participate in a number of campus events and programs related to the book.\nCLICK HERE for pictures from Campus Community Book Project Events.\nThis program is sponsored by the Campus Council of Community & Diversity, The Office of Campus Community Relations and the Office of the Provost.

{"idx": "22482", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: England's James Vince was spectacularly run out with a century beckoning on his Ashes debut as Australia hit back to leave the first Test finely balanced after day one today. Captain Joe Root and Alastair Cook both fell cheaply before the tourists reached 196 for four when bad light ended an attritional, rain-affected day at the Gabba ground in Brisbane.\nVince top-scored as the tourists scored slowly, but Australia loosened their hard-earned advantage when they dismissed him along with the key wicket of Root late on. Vince, on 83, scampered for a quick single off Josh Hazlewood but a brilliant off-balance throw from Nathan Lyon prowling in the covers caught him well out of his ground.\nIt was a moment of triumph for the spinner, who is normally taciturn but gained notoriety for telling the tourists that Australia aimed to \"end careers\" in the Ashes series.\nVince, who was earlier put down by recalled wicketkeeper Tim Paine off Lyon, led a fighting English rearguard with Mark Stoneman after the early loss of Cook. It took a special piece of fielding from Lyon to end Vince's 170-ball, four-hour vigil and give the Australians hope on a rugged first day on an unresponsive Gabba pitch.\nEighteen runs later, Root fell leg before wicket to Pat Cummins for 15 off 50 balls after a review, in a another huge scalp for the toiling Australians. At stumps, Dawid Malan was batting on 28 along with Moeen Ali, whose 13 included the day's only six.\nAustralia have a formidable record at the intimidating 'Gabbatoir', where they have not lost a Test match since 1988, and where England haven't won in 31 years. But Vince and Stoneman had few problems mastering Australia's vaunted fast bowling trio before Stoneman, the Surrey opening bat, was bowled between his bat and pad by Pat Cummins for 53 nearing tea.\nIt looked as though Vince would go on and crown his resilient innings with a century after passing his previous highest Test score of 42. Vince survived a big moment nearing tea when he edged Lyon on 68, only for the deflection to bounce away off the top of the gloves of recalled wicketkeeper Tim Paine, much to the Australians' anguish.\nVince put on a 125-run second-wicket stand with Stoneman as the Australian bowling attack struggled on a slow-paced Gabba pitch.\nIt was a spirited recovery after the early wicket of Cook in the third over. The former England captain only lasted 10 balls before he edged pace spearhead Mitchell Starc to Peter Handscomb at first slip for just two. It continued an uncertain start to the Ashes tour for Cook, who amassed 766 runs in England's 3-1 series victory in 2010-2011 but who has just one half-century in five innings on the current visit.\nStoneman continued his prolific form following his century and three half-centuries in the four innings of the warm-up games.

Using Yahoo\u2019s position eligibility designations, \u2018Melo was the top-rated small forward in this category last season. If you include SF/PF players like Lamar Odom and Shawn Marion, \u2018Melo still ranks in the top five. Dirk Nowitzki gets lauded for his percentage categories, but \u2018Melo outperformed him here last year.\n: Not quite as impressive as his FG%, but \u2018Melo will not kill your team here. In fact, he ranks as a very useful player because of how often he gets to the line.\n: This remains the bread and butter for \u2018Melo. He will not win the scoring title with Allen Iverson on the team, but only a handful of players have a chance of averaging 30 ppg for the season every year, and \u2018Melo makes the short list.\n: Here is where you need to update your dossier on \u2018Melo. Sure, when he was scoring a lot, but did no work on the boards or from beyond the arc, he was overrated as a fantasy player. Last year he hauled down more than seven boards a game. And this was while he played alongside the defensive presence known as Marcus Camby. He stands a good chance of setting a new career high in rebounding average.\nLeBron James and other point forwards continue to outperform \u2018Melo here. So instead, compare him to the average; any player not known for distributing the ball who can drop more than 3.5 dimes a game remains very useful in the fantasy game. Yes, you need top flight point guards and some depth at the swing positions in you draft \u2018Melo to win assists but the same could be said for the likes of Caron Butler and Rashard Lewis.\n: He has averaged 0.7 moneyballs over his career thus far, definitely below average for a fantasy small forward, but serviceable.\nServiceable seems like the best word to describe \u2018Melo here again.\nLike many small forwards, he is a non-factor here. Thankfully Tim Duncan was drafted in the second round.\n: Like any other star in the league who gets the ball a lot, \u2018Melo will rack up his share of miscues. In a head-to-head league, push for a daily transaction league if you use turnovers; this brings in the intrigue of deciding whether or not you should sit players late in the weekend to try to win turnovers.\nThis team had the misfortune of drafting Gilbert Arenas in the first round. Granted, this was way before news on Arenas broke, but nevertheless scoring is needed in a big way. Progression in FG% and rebounds make \u2018Melo a better fantasy player than he has ever been."}

Old habits die hard. Having equipment is one thing, using them is another. For small and marginal farmers, the math just doesn\u2019t work. A penalty of Rs 2,500 per acre works out cheaper than the Rs 6,000-7,000 per acre stubble-processing cost.\nNow, instead of getting the problem resolved, politics is taking over. The Punjab and Haryana governments are in denial mode, claiming there is \u2018no stubble-burning\u2019. In fact, farmers\u2019 unions in Punjab, seeking incentives for paddy straw management, are actually calling for stubble burning in protest. It is time India tried something new.\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize for economics went to Richard Thaler for his \u2018nudge theory\u2019: small policy tweaks based on behavioural sciences that help achieve largescale outcomes at a low cost. Thaler\u2019s \u2018nudge\u2019 has been deployed successfully by many countries from Britain to the US. In India, it could help solve the farmers\u2019 crop stubble-burning issue better.\nThe biggest challenges India faces are layered, complex and require behavioural shifts. Stubble burning is just one among many. As garbage mountains rise, Indians must learn to collect, segregate and process its waste in a sustainable manner. Toilets have been built to bring down open defecation rates.\nBut getting people to use them is a different matter. India\u2019s war against cash, despite demonetisation, has been tough. This list is long: from trespassing on railway tracks and flouting a ban on plastic, to overspeeding and drunken driving, to environmental degradation and low tax compliance rate.\nSo far, GoI\u2019s thrust has been to spend money to build infrastructure from expressways to toilets and skywalks to subways. That\u2019s the easy part. Improving their usage and compliance is the tough bit. Enacting laws and punishments does not help. Worse, punishing and penalising people for minor offences is costly and logistically challenging.\nThaler\u2019s Nudge Theory is based on how people think and behave. It helps evolve subtle policy shifts to improve people\u2019s default decision-making without penalising or coercing them. \u2018Nudge\u2019 is introducing smaller plate sizes in buffet meals to decrease food waste.

Then there\u2019s the kind of travel I do for work. As a magazine writer, I don\u2019t travel every day, but when I do travel, it\u2019s often to strange places on very short notice. Last year, I spent a weekend on a boat in the canals of Central Florida. There was another time when I spent a week at a nudist camp in rural Pennsylvania. When you\u2019re leaving in a hurry and sleeping in strange places, it\u2019s crucial to have a good packing system in order. Over the years, I\u2019ve come away with a few nonnegotiables\u2014this is all of the gear I swear by.\nAnything that\u2019s precious and small will always end up at the bottom of a suitcase. This goes for expensive things\u2014jewelry, gold coins\u2014but also practical, invaluable things like bobby pins. After one too many games of needle in a haystack, I appropriated this plastic pillbox as a solution. I\u2019ve saved myself a lot of rummaging by combining my small things into one much larger thing. It\u2019s also good for things like actual pills. It\u2019s annoying to stop at a drugstore on assignment, so I tend to load it up with an assortment of allergy pills, antacids, and ibuprofen.\nSometimes\u2014no matter how well I plan, no matter how many souvenirs I don\u2019t buy\u2014I still end up with a pile of stuff that just doesn\u2019t fit inside my suitcase. After paying one overage fee at bag check, I started packing an extra bag inside of my suitcase. I like these plaid bags because they are cheap, virtually indestructible, and fold into a nice and tidy rectangle. For those who wish to travel with more subtlety and dignity, this packable duffel will work just as well.\nOK, this one\u2019s a bit of an outlier, but hear me out. While I love when hotels lavish you with overly large bath towels, sometimes you have to make do with whatever\u2019s on hand. This is a compact piece of fabric that uses dense microfibers to soak up moisture, doing as good a job in half the space. At the nudist camp, I used it after my shower. I\u2019ve used it to wipe my sweaty brow. In chilly cabins, I\u2019ve even used it as a second blanket. It\u2019s also 30 by 60 inches and folds into an 8-by-8-inch carrying case."}

This is different. This is very different, regardless of Manning\u2019s be-here-now mentality.\nThe team has spoken openly about drafting a quarterback to replace him \u2014 whether that quarterback is Kyler Murray of Oklahoma, Dwayne Haskins of Ohio State, Daniel Jones of Duke, Ryan Finley of North Carolina State or Will Grier of West Virginia. Even Manning can\u2019t avoid acknowledging the obvious.\nIn Manning\u2019s mind, he is still the starter.\nAt some point, the decision won\u2019t be his. And that decision could come soon, even if it takes a young quarterback some time to get up to speed and be in position to play. There still is the chance the Giants will trade for a quarterback. They have been mentioned in connection with Josh Rosen of the Cardinals and there is speculation that they could be interested in Russell Wilson if the Seahawks can\u2019t come to an agreement on a contract extension.\nThe Giants need to keep all of their options open. Wilson certainly is an enticing one, although it\u2019s hard to see the Seahawks cutting ties with a potential Hall of Fame quarterback who is only 30 years old. Then again, it was hard to envision the Giants trading Odell Beckham Jr. a year after signing him to a $90 million contract extension, and look what happened there.\nEither way, Manning may be playing on borrowed time, even if his mindset won\u2019t allow him to think that far ahead.\nManning did show improvement in the second half of last season after a 1-7 start, and the Giants hope the offense can pick up where it left off \u2014 even without Beckham. There is no longer an adjustment period to coach Pat Shurmur\u2019s offense, so it is reasonable to expect a better performance.\nFor Manning, it has to be better, especially early on. If there is a highly drafted quarterback sitting behind him and the Giants get off to another poor start, there\u2019s no way Shurmur will stick with Manning indefinitely. But Manning often has been at his best when the heat is on, especially with his two signature Super Bowl wins against the Patriots.\nThen again, that was a long, long time ago, and Manning doesn\u2019t have the strong cast around him that played such a huge role in those two championship runs.\nHe has been given another chance."}

In ChemEx2, teachers are introduced to multi-faceted chemical phenomena and empowered to create targeted learning experiences that are adapted to their students. We seek to build a community of reflective practitioners who transform the way chemistry is experienced by students.\nChemistry Experiences and Experiments for Learning (ChemEx2) is the result of a collaboration between professors from the Stanford Department of Chemistry, local classroom teachers, and the Stanford Center to Support Excellence in Teaching (CSET).\nChemEx2 employs a guided-inquiry approach to science learning in which students learn core chemical concepts through engaging with chemical phenomena. The NGSS define phenomenon as an observable event that students can explain or make sense of using the three dimensions (disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts). A ChemEx2 phenomenon may be demonstrated by the teacher or assembled by the students and serves as the basis for development of a particular chemical principle.\nIn the ChemEx2 approach, students experience a chemical phenomenon, observe carefully, and ask questions about what they see. In response to their questions, students are provided with materials and instructional scaffolds so that they can design experiments to develop their understanding of the phenomenon. Students use the data they collect to generate evidence-based claims, explanations or models. The full ChemEx2 cycle thus engages students in multiple NGSS practices.\nIn the summer institute, teacher leaders model practices such as eliciting student understanding, probing students to push their thinking, and giving students customized feedback on their work. Participating teachers are given opportunities to observe, analyze, and practice these interactional skills. Participating teachers also develop skills in curricular sequencing by exploring how phenomena relate to one another how a single phenomenon can be used at multiple points in a year.\nCentral to the ChemEx2 philosophy is the idea that teachers should tailor learning experiences to their students. ChemEx2 has developed a core set of rich phenomena that illustrate a wide range of chemical concepts. During the ChemEx2 Summer Institute, teachers are supported in the process of selecting a learning purpose for a phenomenon, altering the phenomenon to meet the needs of their students, and developing a classroom-ready product."}

In pursuing the Blue Dog agenda, Ross may have a hard time reconciling competing pressures.\nAn array of politically powerful interests in Arkansas oppose the House bill.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the dominant insurer with 75 percent of the state market, objects to a proposed government-run plan to compete with private insurers. The Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce also opposes this so-called public option and another feature that requires employers to provide coverage to workers or pay a stiff penalty.\nRoss generally agrees with their positions, but has to decide how far he can go without alienating Democratic leaders and many constituents who likely would benefit from access to subsidized health insurance and an expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor.\nRich Huddleston, the executive director of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a nonpartisan social welfare advocacy group, said of Ross: \"We believe he supports the overall concern of health care reform . . . It's just our hope that whatever he tries to push around cost containment doesn't get in the way of promoting good health care for kids and their families.\"\nRoss knows the problems, and says he is prepared to hold out for a better bill.\n\"You know, it's easy to provide everybody a shiny new insurance card,\" he said. \"But what's important here is they actually have access to a doctor once they get the insurance card.\"\nRoss' 4th congressional district covers the southern half of the state outside of Little Rock, with a third of it rural and the remainder dotted by towns including Hot Springs, Magnolia, Texarkana and Hope, the nearest town to Prescott with a hospital. Ross' 660,000 constituents have a median income of $29,675.\nPrescott calls itself \"The City of Progress,\" but the government seat of Nevada County is barely hanging on. Vacant storefronts dot the streetscape. Workers are losing employer-provided health insurance or paying more for it. An average of two in 10 residents have no health care insurance, and those who have coverage have seen their premiums skyrocket by 80 percent since 2000, according to data compiled by Ross' office.\nLocally owned J.D. and Billy H"}

In fact, this week\u2019s episode is the first episode the tribe of four has managed to avoid losing an immunity challenge.\nWhile they were not able to beat Kama, they did prove to be slightly better at puzzles than Manu by making a massive come back after being in last place during the entire challenge.\nThe victory, unfortunately, was short lived, as this week\u2019s episode was a double eviction with a unique twist on the second immunity challenge. Just before the three tribes competed in the second immunity challenge, Jeff revealed that only one of the three tribes would win immunity this week, forcing the other two to go to tribal council.\nAfter winning yet another competition, Kama sent both Manu and Lesu to tribal council. It was in that moment that Probst revealed they would only be voting out a single member.\nNaturally, this presented a problem as Manu and Lesu both consisted of four tribe members and the vote would likely result in a tie. Living in two different camps, the two tribes were not able to discuss the votes with each other prior to the tribal council. This resulted in a great deal of whispering and pulling people aside prior to the vote.\nDespite everyone claiming they were four strong with their tribe and willing to put their fate in drawing rocks, when push came to shove, everyone decided Wendy was not worth drawing rocks over as she was evicted during the re-vote.\nBoth Wardog and Victoria had said during their confessionals that they would vote however they needed to vote to prevent a rock draw, as they didn\u2019t want to take the risk of possibly going home.\nWendy, who didn\u2019t really seem to be sitting close to her tribe or Lesu, flashed a vibrant smile as she pulled Probst into a warm embrace after being evicted, explaining that she was happy to have gotten a chance to play even if she didn\u2019t win.\nNew episodes of Survivor: Edge of Extinction air every week only on CBS."}

In stark contrast, the 2016 Election Day exit poll of voters revealed an electorate forced to pick between, as one Democratic wiseguy put it, \u201cthe evil of two lessers.\u201d Voters in 2016 gave Democrat Hillary Clinton a 55 percent unfavorable rating and just a 43 percent favorable rating, but even more negatively regarded was Republican Donald Trump, who received just a 38 percent favorable rating and a 60 percent unfavorable rating.\nIt is fair to say that in the 2016 election, if Trump had been running unopposed on the presidential ballot, he would have lost. The only reason he won is that he was running against Clinton. Nearly 1 in 5 voters in 2016 admitted they held unfavorable feelings toward both Trump and Clinton. So Trump won the White House by carrying 60 percent of those voters who did not like him personally but who apparently liked Clinton even less.\nBut now it\u2019s 2018, and because midterm elections are invariably a referendum on voters\u2019 approval or disapproval \u2014 professionally and personally \u2014 of the current president, Republicans are increasingly unconfident about this November. Why? In the post-World War II era, whenever a president\u2019s job rating is below 50 percent approval, that president\u2019s party loses an average of 43 House seats in the midterm election. Trump\u2019s most recent Gallup result is just 39 percent approval. Thanks to Republican pollster Lance Tarrance, we know that none of the past five presidents \u2014 from Ronald Reagan through Barack Obama \u2014 saw an improvement is his job approval rating in the year before his first midterm.\nTo put it less elegantly, since the upset win of Democrat Conor Lamb in a solidly Republican House district in southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 even in spite of Republican and conservative groups outspending Democrats by a 5-1 ratio \u2014 there have been reports of an outbreak of bed-wetting in the increasingly anxious House GOP caucus.\nBut Clinton could be coming to the Republicans\u2019 rescue. Clinton, whose most recent favorable rating in the Gallup Poll was 36 percent \u2014 her lowest ever \u2014 cannot stop discussing her 2016 defeat. In an appearance in India to promote her latest memoirs, Clinton explained: \u201cI won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward,\u201d and white married women supported Trump because of \u201congoing pressure to vote the way that (their) husband, (their) boss, (their) son, whoever, believes (they) should.\u201d Clinton blames her defeat on the voters who fell for Trump\u2019s \u201clooking backwards\u201d campaign.\nClinton effectively has thrown a life preserver to Republicans scared of the voters\u2019 expected harsh November judgment on their party\u2019s control of Washington by giving her political opponents the unearned option of making Hillary Clinton \u2014 and her apparent contempt for the voters \u2014 instead of Donald Trump\u2019s flawed character and flawed record the main issue of 2018.

With this news, Nanjiani adds one more exciting title to his hot streak of projects, having recently come off an eye-opening performance in CBS All Access\u2019 The Twilight Zone. And it looks like there\u2019s more to look forward to from Nanjiani.\nNo details were reported on the character that Nanjiani would be playing, but at first glance it seemed like he would be up for the role of Makkari, a speedster with a talent for designing and building high-speed vehicles. The character is in line with Nanjiani\u2019s past lighthearted comedic roles, however, he has been proving to be a talented dramatic actor lately. Nanjiani showed off his chops in The Big Sick and in the pilot episode of the new The Twilight Zone, in which he delivered a particularly haunting and vicious performance. Marvel has made a habit of casting traditionally comedic actors in lead roles to give the characters levity, and it\u2019s worked like gangbusters for them (see: Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy). If Marvel is casting Nanjiani in this way, against type, perhaps we\u2019ll see him as Gilgamesh, AKA The Forgotten One, an outcast of the Eternals who was exiled for meddling in the human world. With THR dropping a pun about the \u201csands of time\u201d in their report, perhaps Gilgamesh is the role after all.\nZhao, who helmed the acclaimed indie film The Rider, is set to direct The Eternals, with a script from Matthew and Ryan Firpo.

We are peaking as well with our No. 2 choice winning for a second straight week and our No. 1 choice from last week, Zach Johnson, valiantly trying to track down Stricker before finishing T-3. Let's get to this week's thoughts before we lose our momentum.\nThe PGA Tour heads to Sandwich, England for the British Open. Despite the amount of withdrawals, this is a major championship and it comes with a trophy any player would eat a couple of pounds of deep-fried fish and chips to get his hands on.\nRandom tournament fact: The Open Championship was first contested in 1860. That's before the start of the Civil War in the United States and when Old Tom Morris was simply known as \"Tommy Mo.\"\nLouis Oosthuizen (100-1 according to Ladbrokes.com). Has a man's love of tractors ever cost him a major championship? That's the risk \"Shrek\" took when he played in last week's John Deere Classic instead of heading to Scotland to prep for his title defense. The South African grew up on a farm and really wanted to compete in Illinois so he could check out John Deere's headquarters. He missed the cut, which gave him more time to get back across the pond -- or to try out some new models. Either way, we're not expecting a repeat.\n, it's hard to justify it when he has to beat 155 other players in the field. Similarly, when it comes to filling out your fantasy roster, I think the odds of you making a move with him on your bench, while everyone else plays him, are much better than just following the crowd. Plus, after his romp at Congressional, he's giving everyone else two shots a round.\nSteve Stricker (33-1). As much as we love the Strick Show, we've seen this, um, show before. Stricker wins the John Deere Classic and then does nothing abroad the next week, with a T-55 and T-52 in the Open the last two years. Also, his last top five at a major came all the way back in 1999. By the way, how is it possible that Pat Riley trademarked the term three-peat? No one who won three in a row of anything before never thought of this? What am I missing?\nJason Day (40-1). I continue to like this guy more and more, but this week, I don't have a good feeling about him. While I think it's great he showed respect to the John Deere Classic tournament officials by playing (he remains thankful to the event for giving him a sponsor's exemption when he was 18), it definitely wasn't in his best interest if he wants to win a British Open. Like Stricker, Day will now spend much of the beginning of the week getting acclimated to the time difference and the weather"}

It also said at least 102 security personnel were injured."}

Despite Harvey and the crushing news of the Supreme Court allowing Trump to keep blocking refugee resettlement, here is a uplifting story from the city with the largest population of resettled refugees, highlighting the need for us to keep fighting for them.\nOutside Minute Maid Park, the Houston Astros stadium, milling amongst the blue and orange fans, Ghulam Kehar waits for Dayana Halawo and her family with tickets and a T-shirt to wear as she throws the ceremonial first pitch. He is the CEO and co-founder of Amaanah Refugee Services, which works with resettled refugees in Texas \u2013 the top state in the nation to host resettled refugees. On July 31, 2017, Dayana, a Muslim resettled refugee who arrived in Houston from Syria last August, was invited by Amaanah to throw the opening pitch to open the game. This is a distinct American tradition, where a guest of honor throws a baseball to mark the end of pregame festivities and the start of the game.\nAmaanah chose Dayana for her resilience and spirit of giving back. Amaanah works with former refugees months after governmental resettlement assistance ends. Since 2008, Amaanah has touched the lives of over 10,000 refugees. This is the second year the Astros \u2014 the leading team in the American League West\u2014 have worked with Amaanah to give refugees a \u201ctruly American\u201d experience and a special honor.\nIn 2005, Dayana met Mohamed Bilal. He owned the beauty store located in front of her house. Ethnic differences divided the families over the marriage, but the two were determined to become husband and wife. \u201dI left everything for Mohamed Bilal,\u201d Dayana shares her love story.\nHer \u2013happy\u2013 home became a warzone again in 2011. All supply routes to their city were blocked and aerial shelling and bombing filled their days and nights. When Assad\u2019s forces bombed her neighborhood, Mohamed Bilal and Dayana barely escaped, clutching their 1-year-old son they ran out of her building. Nine months pregnant, Dayana was about to give birth to her daughter and understands how her mother felt leaving her life behind.\nToday, Bilal and Dayana have settled into a bustling life in cosmopolitan Houston, befriending people of all colors and paths in life.\nIn Homs, she attended the Al-Salam school and became an English teacher at her alma mater. Now, the former refugee from Syria is giving back as an instructor at Amaanah\u2019s Awesome Academy. Amaanah identifies resettled refugee populations in the school district, says Ghulam, and sends bilingual instructors [to] help the public school teachers during and after school hours. \u201cWe have become an additional support system for [former refugee] kids in the system,\u201d he shares humbly. \u201cDayana is a teacher there \u2013 which is pretty cool,\u201d he adds.\nDayana arrives at Minute Maid Park, a baseball glove in hand and prayers on her lips.

A tech then appears in a live video stream on a portion of the display (although the tech cannot see the customer). The tech can then make notations on a user's display or help a user navigate through a process.\nAmazon touted the lighter side of instant tech support using Mayday in a statement. Customers have asked tech advisors to draw on their screens, including everything from happy faces to rainbows, unicorns, fire-breathing dragons and aliens. One customer asked a tech adviser to sing happy birthday to someone receiving the Fire HDX as a gift as the person was receiving it.\nSome tech advisors have even received date requests and marriage proposals, Amazon said.\nThere's also a more serious side to the concept, analysts said: The Mayday button's popularity should be a wake-up call to product manufacturers, many of whom suffer low customer-service ratings and should consider more personal contact with users.\n\"Companies could learn a lot from the way Amazon does customer service,\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. \"The focus Amazon has on customers, and has had for years, is often what makes users so sticky to them. It's true of their general Amazon Web site, too. Consumers love good customer service.\"\nGold said that what Amazon's done with Mayday is not completely new, as enterprises have provided remote screen control, without video streaming, to IT help desk personnel serve users for years. \"Remote control is not as slick as the Mayday button, and Amazon has made it work fast and easy,\" he said.\nAnother analyst, Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy, said Mayday appears to be \"more of a gimmick than real support\" based on the way Amazon talks about it. Amazon, however, needs to \"paint a friendly face\" to customers, he said, since it doesn't have physical stores or local distribution centers where customers can meet service personnel.\nWith Amazon expected to launch its own smartphone soon, possibly at an event in Seattle on June 18, it seems possible that Amazon would enable Mayday tech support on that smartphone device as well.\nA Youtube video about the event shows people holding the expected device and reacting to it by moving their eyes and heads back and forth. One woman says, \"It moved with me.\" Some observers said that suggests the device could have a kind of 3-D technology.\nWhen asked whether Amazon expects to have Mayday on its first smartphone, an Amazon spokesperson responded via email: \"Ha, I don't blame you for asking.\" Was that a semi-confirmation of a smartphone coming?\nGold said putting the Mayday button on a smartphone could be a problem for some customers. \"If people start doing video chats for service over a standard cellular network, what will that do to their data allocation and ultimately to their bill?\" he said."}

{"idx": "22534", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Trenches are often used as gutters to transport water away from a landscape.\nTrenches in a landscape come in several shapes and sizes and often serve a valuable purpose. While features such as trenches can pose a challenge to the home landscaper, they are not impossible to populate and can become a valuable, as well as beautiful, part of the overall aesthetic of your lawn.\nMany trenches in the landscape are put there deliberately by the homeowner. Small trenches made intentionally may provide a barrier between plants or between a garden landscape and wastewater outlet. Trenches of varying sizes may provide a natural gutter for rainfall, ensuring that water drains away from soil quickly. Larger trenches may provide a flood plain to catch overflow from a nearby water source, keeping it out of the garden and off the lawn. Artificial trenches are made with tools ranging from a garden spade to a tractor or backhoe, depending on their size.\nDips and trenches that exist on the landscape naturally may also stem from several possible causes. Like a house foundation, the landscape sits on a layer of tightly packed soil. As this soil settles, it sometimes shifts, causing dips and slopes. Water overflow from a nearby water source can also erode soil, causing natural trenches.\nArtificial landscapes built to provide a barrier between plants will benefit from thick layers of mulch, which help prevent plants from gaining a foothold while protecting topsoil from wind erosion. Larger trenches, whether natural or artificial, may have steep walls, so that plants grown within the trench must make do with less light. Alternative ground cover, such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), which grows in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 4 through 11, or Muhly grass (Muhlenbergia capillaris), which grows in USDA zones 6 through 10, can tolerate low light.\nAll trenches collect water and this problem causes several other difficulties in keeping trench landscapes healthy. Trenches that are not protected with deeply rooted plants can suffer serious soil erosion, which can displace shallow rooted plants and even make trenches wider over time. The pools of water that collect in a trench are also a magnet to insect nuisances such as mosquitoes and can even threaten nearby plants with an infection caused by waterborne fungus or bacteria. Excessive moisture can also ruin root systems, saturating them and making them susceptible to microorganisms such as nematodes.\nRussell, Sean. \"Trench Landscape Facts.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/trench-landscape-56878.html.

Since then, Benjamin has become an internationally regarded pianist performing concerti with renowned orchestras from the London Philharmonic and the Tokyo Symphony to the Brazilian Symphony. For his Helsinki debut with Kymi Sinfonietta, Benjamin\u2019s performance was described as \u2018Wunderkind dives straight to the heart of the music\u2019 (Helsingin Sanomat), again celebrating his prodigious intuition. In the United States, Benjamin Grosvenor has performed with the North Carolina Symphony, and made his Carnegie Hall debut as soloist with the New York Youth Orchestra at the age of thirteen. In 2009, Benjamin\u2019s sell-out debut with the Philharmonia at the Royal Festival Hall was hailed as \u2018a performance that took its expressive and dramatic cues from the very heart of the music, and in so doing crafted an interpretation of palpable character and astute panache\u2019 (Daily Telegraph). Benjamin\u2019s orchestral performances have taken him to prominent venues such as the Barbican, Muza Kawasaki in Tokyo and the Royal Albert Hall and he has worked with numerous esteemed conductors including Alexander Lazarev, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Alan Buribayev.\nAlready an accomplished recitalist, Benjamin performs to acclaim across the world. A regular at the Wigmore Hall in London, he has also made debuts at venues including the Victoria Hall in Singapore and the Philia Hall in Tokyo. In the USA, Benjamin has appeared at the Gilmore Festival and is a favourite in Saint Paul at the Chopin Society in Minnesota. Benjamin has recently given a highly successful fifteen-concert tour across Germany, for which he was labelled a \u2018piano visionary\u2019 by the S\u00fcddeutschen Zeitung. Benjamin continues to work chamber music collaborations into his busy schedule and performs regularly with members of the English Chamber Orchestra in London. This season, Benjamin Grosvenor becomes a member of the prestigious BBC New Generation Artists scheme. Highlights of the season include his BBC Proms debut on the First Night, playing Liszt Piano Concerto No. 2 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek, and a further appearance at the BBC Proms playing the Britten Piano Concerto with the National Youth Orchestra and Vladimir Jurowski. This season has also seen successful performances in the LSO St. Luke\u2019s Chopin Series and a Belgian debut at BOZAR in Brussels.\nIn 2011 Benjamin signed to Decca Classics, and in doing so has become the youngest British musician ever to sign to the label, and the first British pianist to sign to the label in almost 60 years. His first recording for Decca will include Chopin\u2019s Four Scherzi and Ravel\u2019s Gaspard de la Nuit and is due for release in July 2011. Benjamin has already been involved in a number of successful recordings. His recordings for the 200th anniversary edition of Chopin\u2019s complete works (EMI, 2010) received outstanding accolades. He was lauded for his \u2018sensitivity of touch, general musicality and affection for the music\u2019 by Jessica Duchen in BBC Music Magazine. Benjamin\u2019s recording \u2018This and That\u2019 (Bowers & Wilkins Society of Sound/EMI, 2008) also received overwhelming commendation. Bryce Morrison"}

The two agreements with Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) will see Microsoft receive carbon-free electricity to power its Puget Sound campuses and partner with the PUD on broadband connectivity in Chelan County.\n\"This agreement provides much more than renewable energy for Microsoft \u2014 it's an investment in new opportunities for communities in central Washington and the competitiveness of Washington state,\" said Shelley McKinley, general manager, Technology and Corporate Responsibility, Microsoft. \"We're proud to be powering our Puget Sound operations in a way that reduces carbon emissions, supports the clean energy sector and supports efforts to expand connectivity. We look forward to working with Chelan PUD to achieve these goals.\"\nThrough the five-year power supply agreement, Microsoft will receive hydropower from Chelan PUD that meets the high bar for carbon-free and clean energy established in the direct access contract struck last year. It will also keep carbon-free power generated in Washington state within the state, delivering economic and environmental benefits for Chelan County, the greater Seattle area and the state.\nThe two organizations also signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on efforts to expand broadband service in the most challenging, most rural parts of Chelan County. Connectivity is a shared goal of the two organizations, as demonstrated by the PUD's success in currently providing broadband access to about three-quarters of the county, and Microsoft's Airband Initiative, which aims to bring broadband to three million people in rural America by 2022.\nThe power supply agreement directly enables this work, as revenues from the power sales will be used to fund hydropower reinvestment, broadband expansion and other benefits for Chelan County. Microsoft will bring technical assistance to this effort, supporting Chelan PUD's desire to expand technology access to remote parts of Chelan County.\n\"Today, innovative technology is pairing up with renewable hydropower to support our shared goals of a healthy environment and a strong, evolving economy,\" said General Manager Steve Wright, Chelan PUD. \"The new partnership with Microsoft provides immediate economic value for Chelan County as well as long-term benefits in broadband connectivity. This deal displays hydropower's capability to support achieving 100% clean energy goals, while providing funding and access to expertise to help meet our objective of providing broadband access to 85% of county residents and hopefully more.\"\n\"This is an exciting day for the state of Washington and especially for residents of Chelan County,\" said Governor Jay Inslee. \"This agreement between Microsoft and Chelan PUD is a perfect example of how Washington's renewable, reliable hydropower resources will continue to play a central role in driving innovation, supporting rural economic development and transitioning our economy to 100% clean energy.\"\nChelan County PUD has an all-renewable, carbon-free generation portfolio composed of more than 99% hydropower.\nIn addition, Microsoft is in the final stages of negotiating an additional renewable energy purchase agreement that would see the company contract for output of a new wind or solar resource in the state, expected to be sited and operational within the next five years.\nNo additional infrastructure is required in Chelan's service area to be able to send power from Chelan PUD to Microsoft.

Just take a ride down to Bangalore, the city with the fastest growth rate in Asia. You will find it quite easy to hide yourself amidst the city's large floating population, which the police estimate to sometimes be as high as 200,000 per day.\nThe most recent case was when some suspected terrorists, wanted by the Tamil Nadu police, were killed in a major shootout in Bangalore's MS Ramiah Layout. Two years ago, the police had arrested some Deendar Anjuman activists on the charge of planning to carry out explosions in a church while gangsters from Mumbai were apprehended in 1998.\nThe Andhra police often drive down to pick up wanted naxalites who are hiding in the city and last year shot dead Chini Sudarshan, a naxalite-turned-extortionist, on the city's outskirts. In the 1990s, suspects from the United Liberation Front of Asom were tracked down in the city. The Mumbai police have apprehended gangsters seeking to sneak out of India from Bangalore airport. The maidservant who robbed then Miss Universe 1994 Sushmita Sen's residence in Calcutta in 1995 was apprehended in Bangalore!\nAnd perhaps in the most famous case of them all, the assassins of Rajiv Gandhi were killed in Bangalore way back in 1991.\nIndia's garden city has over the years now acquired the reputation of becoming a sanctuary for terrorists and antisocial elements wanted in others parts of the country. The city's salubrious climate, hospitable residents and distance from trouble spots, the very reasons why multinationals chose to make it their operation base, have also, ironically, become the reasons why militants on the run find it a convenient refuge.\nUnfortunately, there is little data available on the number of persons from different states being arrested. The reason: a police team from the state in which the militants are wanted usually acts directly on a tip-off and raids their hideout in the city, after informing the local police who, being overburdened, are quite happy to stay out of the action. The raiding team takes away the militants and often records that the arrest was made in the home state rather than Karnataka. There have even been occasions when the raiding police team does not even inform the local police about is presence to arrest some wanted criminal. For instance, when the federal Intelligence Bureau arrested a terrorist who was apparently planning to kill federal Home Minister L K Advani, the Bangalore police learnt of the case only the following day.\nThe police believe that over 100 Pakistani nationals have simply disappeared in the city over the past few decades. Since foreigners entering Bangalore have to register themselves with the police, many of them give out a false name and then simply melt into the populace.\n\"Thankfully, the visiting terrorists and underworld dons have made no ideological incursions into Bangalore,\" says H T Sangliana, former Bangalore police commissioner and currently inspector general of prisons. \"They just use the city as a temporary refuge. However, the police here is being very vigilant on this front and we want to send out a clear message to terrorists that Bangalore is no longer a safe haven for them.\"\nOne of the key reasons that many wanted persons prefer Bangal"}

The five trans actors are MJ Rodriguez, Indya Moore (pictured above as Angel), Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar and Angelica Ross, with each one playing authentic transgender characters.\nWriter-producer Janet Mock pledged that Pose would move beyond telling transgender origin stories like coming out in order to see \"trans characters beyond the struggles with their bodies\" and beyond \"their trans-ness.\"\nAs part of that, Murphy noted that he would not have allowed a straight actor to take on any of trans roles as that conflicted with the show's central theme.\n\"The show is about the search for being authentic, about creating opportunities,\" Murphy said. \"We're past an era of straight men playing these roles. It's time to think differently and offer more opportunities to people who want to work. Many of this cast have never been in front of the camera before.\"\nMurphy noted that while he's optimistic that the show makes stars of its trans castmembers and affords them the chance at having a career outside of Pose, he hoped the same would be true for its writing staff, including Steven Canals \u2014 who co-created Pose and penned the script \u2014 as well as Mock. Pose is the first show for both. \"I'm interested in them getting their next show and moving into the mainstream,\" Murphy said.\nFor his part, Canals noted that he originally penned the script that became Pose during his time at UCLA when he was studying screenwriting in 2014. At the time, he recalled being told that the drama was \"too niche\" and there \"wasn't an audience for it,\" with other executives questioning where a show like that could live. Once he met Murphy, everything came together. Murphy had been contemplating making a TV series based on Paris Is Burning, the 1990 documentary about the New York ball culture, but that changed once he read Canals' script.\n\"It was important to have representation and during that first meeting with Ryan, he understood that and had his own reasoning for wanting to tell this story as well,\" Canals said.\nLike Fox's beloved Glee, which turned the spotlight on the underdog, Murphy hopes Pose put a spotlight on a group of people who he said are \"more and more disenfranchised and cut off.\" \"We want to celebrate them,\" Murphy said of both the trans and ball communities. \"I grew up feeling like I'm never going to be allowed to show the best that I am, so being able to do that now for these people is very powerful.\"\nAs for the series itself, the show starts in 1987 and ends when Madonna releases \"Vogue\" and the ball community goes mainstream."}

Eight other renewable energy projects have been proposed. Of these, NextEra Energy Resources of Juno Beach, Fla. and Portland-based Element Power US, want to build facilities that would become the county's first utility-scale wind turbine facilities, towering hundreds of feet high.\nThe Antelope Valley may not have the shimmering sea views of Santa Monica or the luxury real estate of Beverly Hills. But what it does have is wind. Lots of it. And unlike many other blustery places, the gusts are reliable and display impeccable timing.\n\"The western Antelope Valley boasts both the highest and most consistent winds in almost all of Southern California,\" said Nat Parker, project manager for Element Power's proposed Wildflower Green Energy Farm. \"Between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. the winds reach their highest peak, and it falls in line with when the electrical grid has highest demand.\"\nCounty Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who represents the unincorporated Antelope Valley, said this region \"has the potential to become the nation's leader in green, alternative energy innovation and production.\" But he emphasized that community support is key to the success of these projects.\nElement wants to use 4,000 acres of private land next to the poppy reserve for solar panels and some 50 wind turbines almost 500 feet high. Each turbine would produce enough electricity to power up to 2,000 homes, Parker said.\nSteve Stengel, a spokesman for NextEra, which is proposing 90 turbines on about 7,000 acres in the northwestern Antelope Valley, noted that this area has been identified by the California Energy Commission as suitable for large-scale wind and solar power developments.\nState lawmakers have set a goal of obtaining 33% of California's electricity from alternative clean power sources by 2020, and NextEra is attempting to help the state meet this mandate, Stengel said.\nBut the wind turbines would be in plain view and earshot of residents of nearby communities such as Kings Canyon, Antelope Acres, Portal Ridge and The Lakes. The residents fear that if one such project is approved, others will inevitably follow.\n\"We believe the area can support some industrial-scale solar panels, but we don't believe the whole western Antelope Valley should be covered with them, and we don't believe wind turbines belong anywhere out there,\" said Margaret Rhyne, who is part of a grass-roots effort to limit construction of such facilities.\nCritics argue that erecting wind turbines atop ridges near homes would spoil views, cause noise and devalue properties.

The Daily spoke to Forance, Shaping Sound choreographer and co-founder, about the company and its current tour.\nThe Daily: What is the story behind the show?\nTeddy Forance: So it\u2019s the idea of a re-occurring dream that you are falling in love in your dream with somebody and then you wake up in real life and you\u2019re in this other whole relationship. It\u2019s that place of being so alive in your dreams that you turn it into your reality, and, I don\u2019t want to give away the show, but it comes full circle because I think in the last show, it kind of ended unknowing of what was going to happen. In this show you see Jaimie happy at the end of the show and going through the whole process of feeling insecure and scared and unhappy and really internal to this growth and this process of love and finding love.\nThe Daily: What is different about this tour from your first tour?\nForance: The first tour that we did, we were still developing the story, and the difference between the last show and this show is I feel like you get to know the characters a little bit deeper. We dive more into my role, the guy that Jaimie falls in love with, but really Jaimie\u2019s role, the main character, the dreamer. You really get to know her story better and you get to see her in real life and then in the dream world. I feel like it\u2019s much easier to understand and follow for dancers and non-dancers that come to the show. To be able to impact all different types of people with this kind of show is really a wonderful blessing for us. We\u2019re so proud of the show. I think it\u2019s really going to change a lot of people\u2019s mindsets on more than just dance.\nThe Daily: How has Shaping Sound continued to grow and change as a company since the first tour?\nForance: I think we just understand each other. Every project, we keep growing and shifting and changing. You keep discovering what works and what doesn\u2019t work. We have three new company members, Justine Lutz, Kate Harpootlian, and we have Amy Yakima (SYTYCD Season 10 winner). I think overall, our synergy onstage and understanding the more we dance, the more we\u2019re interacting with our peers, the more were inspired, the more we push each other, the more we\u2019re comfortable to make decisions on the spot together. We\u2019re growing up together as choreographers, as artists and dancers, becoming the best we can possibly be.\nThe Daily: What do you think brands Shaping Sound as a company and distinguishes you guys in the dance world?\nForance: We grew up in the dance convention/"}

Finally, the long-term trend is significant: repetition of the mantra \"this is the bloodiest era in the country's history since the Mexican Revolution\" (Analysis, 4 April) does not make it true. The Cristero (Catholic) insurgency of the late 1920s (ie after the revolution) generated homicide rates of 200 per 100,000 (the standard metric), compared to 24 per 100,000 in 2011; more significantly, the homicide rate in 1940 was 67 per 100,000; and even circa 1960 \u2013 when no revolts happened and the \"Peace of the PRI\" (the then ruling party) prevailed \u2013 it was higher than it is today.

{"idx": "22583", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: With America's recession one year old - according to the official panel of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Massachusetts, who decide these matters retrospectively - and conventional economic medicine so far producing little response from the patient, policymakers are turning to more desperate measures. As the Federal Reserve spends billions of dollars of public money on one rescue attempt after another, much of the US financial system is now effectively on life-support.\nWashington has stepped in repeatedly in the past 12 months with injections of cash. Each time the financial markets have responded with enthusiasm; each time, exuberance has rapidly given way to despair. Now, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has said he is considering buying up Treasury bills, the final step to what economists call 'quantitative easing'.\n'Since the Fed chairman spoke, government bond markets have been on fire,' says Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities. Interest rates have already been cut to just 1 per cent, and once they hit zero the Fed will have to resort to unconventional measures. By buying up Treasuries from investors, it can channel cash out into the financial markets, in a bid to ensure that the funds keep flowing to firms and consumers beyond.\nUS policy has moved a long way in 12 months. Early in the year, much of the public funding came in direct support for the hardest-hit institutions. But as the months went by, policymakers reached for their chequebook with increasing frequency.\nBernanke is an avid student of the Great Depression and the policy failures that helped turn the Great Crash of 1929 into a decade-long slump. Wall Street wags nicknamed him 'Helicopter Ben' after a speech in 2002 revisiting Milton Friedman's proposal that once a central bank has slashed rates to zero, desperate measures may be necessary to pour cash into the economy - and dropping banknotes from a helicopter would be as good a method as any. Bernanke may not quite be dumping cash from the sky, but bit by bit the Fed has effectively nationalised one part of the financial system after another.\nThe bank had already been lending directly to Wall Street; but in early October, as US corporates began to complain that they were finding it increasingly costly to borrow, it announced that it would step in to buy 'commercial paper' - the loans many use to fund their day-to-day operations. In November, it made a much more radical announcement, saying it would use $600bn to buy mortgage-backed securities from the troubled state-backed loan guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nThis effectively superseded Paulson's Troubled Assets Recovery Program (Tarp), which was meant to buy up the near-worthless mortgage-backed securities many banks found themselves stuck with and hold them until the market returned to normal.\nQuantitative easing is a gamble. Consumers and firms may be sceptical about spending in such a chilly economic climate. And even if it kickstarts demand, it will result in a vast and rising budget deficit, and could undermine overseas confidence in US assets. There is also a risk of unleashing inflation. That Bernanke is willing to take that risk powerfully underlines the dire state of America's economy."}

(Lachman himself was only a few movies away from retiring.) Both films star Sidney Toler, who had succeeded Warner Oland as the famous detective in 1938 upon Oland's death, and both find him helped or hindered by Sen Yung as \"No. 2 son\" Jimmy Chan. The first, Dead Men Tell (1941), is the more atmospheric of the two, but the second \u2014 and final film in the series \u2014 Castle in the Desert (1942) is probably the better mystery. Both are compact \u2014 running a minute or two over an hour \u2014 fast paced, slickly made fun. Perfect examples of the artistry of the studio system. The Asheville Film Society will screen Dead Men Tell and Castle in the Desert Tuesday, Oct. 7, at 8 p.m. in Theater Six at The Carolina Asheville and will be hosted by Xpress movie critics Ken Hanke and Justin Souther.\nThe pity was that the series had become re-energized by director Harry Lachman on the last four films. In fact, those films \u2014 especially Dead Men Tell (1941) and Castle in the Desert (1942) \u2014 were among the most atmospheric and stylish of the series. Oddly, these weren\u2019t Lachman\u2019s first brush with the series. He\u2019d made Charlie Chan at the Circus back in 1936 \u2014 during which he managed to alienate most of the cast and annoyed the studio in the bargain. (Lachman is the only person I ever heard Keye Luke \u2014 who played Charlie\u2019s \u201cNo. One Son\u201d in the Oland films \u2014 speak ill of.) Regardless, there is nothing about his work on Charlie Chan at the Circus to suggest the quality he brought to these later films. What made the difference? That\u2019s hard to say, though I have a hunch that it had something to do \u2014 at least in the case of these two films \u2014 the relatively constrained settings allowing him to tap into the studio artistry that was available at the time. The stories of Dead Men Tell and Castle in the Desert afforded him the chance to create tightly controlled little worlds for each film.\nDead Men Tell is the more atmospheric of the two. The sets are limited to a small ship, the dock, a sail loft, and a dive bar. The exteriors are misty and creepy, while the interiors are bathed in shadows. The story takes place in the space of one fog shrouded evening, makingg it feel like a perfectly crafted short story. Charlie quite accidentally becomes embroiled in the events when he comes onto the scene looking for \u201cNo. Two Son\u201d Jimmy (Sen Yung), who he suspects is going to try to sneak onboard a ship slated to go on a treasure hunt. Well, he\u2019s right, but what he hasn\u2019t reckoned on was stumbling onto the murder of treasure hunt organizer Patience Nodbury (a delightful Ethel Griffies).

Photosynthesis is how it will get there, through the process whereby plants convert carbon in the air into organic molecules exuded by roots to feed hungry microbes underground.\nOhio State University scientist Rattan Lal refers to soil restoration as \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d and says it can serve as a \u201cbridge\u201d to climate safety during the transition to a non-fossil fuel economy. In a 2014 white paper, the Rodale Institute showed that regenerative organic farming could capture carbon dioxide in quantities exceeding global emissions.\nIndeed, soils are the only suitable reservoir for the excess carbon in the atmosphere.\nPoliticians are taking note. France's Minister of Agriculture, St\u00e9phane Le Foll, has introduced a program called \u201c4 per 1000,\u201d calling for a yearly increase of 0.4 percent in the amount of organic matter in the world\u2019s agricultural soils. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Soussana, scientific director for the Environment of the French National Institute for Agronomical Research, claims this modest increase in soil carbon globally would be sufficient to offset global greenhouse gas emissions. Depending on how quickly the agricultural community responds, the atmospheric level of CO2 could be kept from rising to levels uniformly viewed as disastrous. At last count, 25 countries, including Australia and the U.K., have announced their commitment to this campaign.\n...soils are the only suitable reservoir for the excess carbon in the atmosphere.\nMichael Pollan is right. Soil is a fix, but not just for climate. Restoring soil also ameliorates desertification, a factor that can destabilize already volatile regions \u2014 consider the unprecedented drought \u2014 perhaps exacerbated by global warming \u2014 that precipitated civil unrest in Syria before the outbreak of civil war there.\nWe need look no further than the ground beneath our feet in our quest for a more verdant, peaceful world. Let\u2019s embrace this convenient truth.\nThis essay was co-authored by Karl Thidemann, a climate communications consultant and co-founder, with Seth Itzkan, of Soil4Climate.\nCog Special Series: Climate Change.

He pointed out that the economic problems are more serious than the decline in military support for Duarte.\n``We're seeing a gradual erosion of the base of popular support,'' says one European diplomat.\nThe austerity plan, urged by the United States, consists of a currency devaluation, an increase in taxes aimed at reducing the large government deficit, and slowing inflation, which jumped almost 20 percent in the space of a year.\nThe devaluation is expected to spark an immediate increase in prices, further hitting the already economically hard-pressed Salvadorean family, say economic and political analysts.\nThe United States Embassy has pushed the government hard to implement the austerity plan, say informed sources.\nFew observers see the economic package putting Duarte in any immediate danger. The greater danger is the long-term erosion of confidence in Duarte, the man many view as the only alternative to the leftist rebels.\nAnalysts point out that if Duarte's promises of peace and reforms are shown to be empty, the left could become a viable alternative for poor Salvadoreans increasingly hurt by the protracted war and the economic crisis.\nIn his speech, Duarte tried to soften the blow by promising to control prices of basic goods and limiting the increase in the prices of public transportation, chiefly used by the poor.\nThe unions have pointed out that price controls are already in effect but the government has been incapable of enforcing them.\n``The poor campesinos (peasant farmers) are the ones who will suffer the most from the package,'' says a peasant leader from the Democratic Popular Unity (UPD), Duarte's major labor base of support in 1984. The UPD, a union of approximately 500,000 workers and farmers, has become disillusioned with the President's failure to fullfill his campaign promises of peace and an improved economy.\nThe wealthy and conservative private sector opposes the measures which hurt them -- a tax on a company's net assets and a stiff tax on El Salvador's premier export, coffee. Economic analysts note that austerity plans generally favor business and hurt consumers.\nPolitical analysts note that the private sector, aside from the coffee growers, has received preferential treatment from Duarte's government.\nOne diplomat says that the right realizes that by destabilizing the government, the left would stand to gain. Many think the austerity plan will help the left rebuild its formerly large political base."}

In the aftermath of the shooting, it seemed faith collapsed in many hearts all over our town. Why did God let this happen? Where was God in all this? I heard the questions but Tain didn\u2019t ask this, and neither did I.\nWe seemed to sense instinctively that this is where faith comes in.\nIn the crushing days after the shootings, when there seemed to be nothing but darkness, grief, and hordes of people and media, I felt as though I didn\u2019t have room to mourn.\nI couldn\u2019t process the loss of Ben or any of the souls that left the earth that day.\nI wanted, needed, to reach out and feel in faith that I could grasp a sense of myself again.

I\u2019d heard her say that before, but she would reiterate it many times in those days. Perhaps this is what Tain experienced. I now see I was acting out of having faith in his pain. And this is what he needed. I suppose God had worked on me, opening my eyes and ears to what Tain was telling me, often without words.\nI showed him the square badges a friend had made so we could tell who was family and to make sure we were all seated together at Trinity. We knew the church would be packed.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said slowly. Time was getting short. I was responsible for driving a van of family members to the church. But I knew this was a request that had to be honored.\nI went to the kitchen computer with photos Darryl and I had put aside for the wake. I printed up two of Tain and Ben playing in a pile of leaves in our yard. I carefully cut them into squares and fastened them with paper clips to Tain\u2019s vest.\nAt the church whenever anyone asked Tain about the pictures on his clothes, he talked about how Ben was his godbrother and how much fun they had playing in the leaves.\nWe have three mementos from that day. One is a small lighthouse Christmas ornament from Pastor Kathie. She had gathered all the children and spoke to them about finding the light in dark times.

This solution doesn't confront the real problem. In business, you do a root cause analysis to determine the problem source, so you can eliminate the problem altogether. What is the root cause of runaway property taxes? In my view, it's runaway school taxes. What are the causes of lack of school funding? One of the major issues is the siphoning of funds to charter and private schools. A rollback of these vouchers is in order.\nThe second issue is the refusal of the Legislature to allocate funding to schools. The third issue is runaway valuations. What is causing this? In my view, the average homeowner is picking up the slack for economic incentives given to companies (corporate welfare) and handouts to high-value property owners who fight their valuations with professional assistance.\nIncentive packages should be reviewed for real impact on average property owners' taxes. Fix these problems rather than tying the hands of elected city officials. Cities should be able to govern according to their needs and the wishes of their residents. A tax cap doesn't solve the real problem.\nIt is time for the Legislature to change, not just limit, property taxes in Texas, but placing caps on rate increases is tantamount to placing a finger on a leaking dam. As long as property valuations keep going up, forcing homeowners to pay taxes based on unrealized gains (or losses), property taxes will continue to hurt homeowners. The solution I propose is to limit property values to the purchase price or originally assessed market value. These limits on tax \"revenue\" should encourage local and state governments to budget accordingly and spend responsibly.\nRe: \"Third lawsuit filed over voter advisory,\" Tuesday Metro & State story.\nIf you are a citizen, either by birth or by naturalization, I can't understand how you could not be upset that individuals are possibly voting in our elections and they are not eligible to vote!

The position was eventually eliminated.\nThe council last night gave the city manager the green light to restructure the staffing in his office when it gave preliminary approval to the fiscal 2013 budget for the city manager's executive office.\nAs part of that budget, two positions will be eliminated in the city manager's office \u2014 chief clerk of the works and director of administration \u2014 while two positions will be added, assistant city manager for operations and a principal staff assistant.\nMr. O'Brien said his office will have the same staffing level (eight) next fiscal year as it does this year, while the net addition to the budget will be about $45,000.\nThe assistant city manager's position has been pegged at $145,000.\nBut Mr. O'Brien said that salary amount is a \u201ctarget\u201d and is \u201cby no means fixed.\u201d He said the eventual salary figure for the job will be determined by the background and expertise of the person hired.\nHe said he will adhere to the requirements of the local residency ordinance in filling that position.\nIn 1996, then-City Manager Thomas R. Hoover implemented an administrative rule requiring newly hired department heads to move to Worcester within a year of their employment. That policy also allows the city manager to waive that requirement when the manager deems necessary.\nHaving the No. 2 person in the city administration live in Worcester was a source of contention during Ms. Jacobson's tenure because she lived in Paxton and was not forced to move into the city.\nMr. O'Brien pointed out that he hasn't had an assistant city manager dedicated solely to serve him for much of his tenure as city manager.\nHe said Ms. Jacobson was an assistant city manager for one year and then was given the assignment to also manage the Economic Development Department, as well as serve as executive director of the Worcester Redevelopment Authority.\nIn comparison, during Mr. Hoover's tenure as city manager, he had three different assistant city managers who solely worked for him and they did not also run a major department.\nThe manager said he would like to have an assistant city manager so he can remove himself from being involved the day-to-day operations of the city government and instead focus on the city's bigger, long-term picture.\n\u201cMuch of my time daily is spent on implementation of initiatives, reforms, reorganization of government, major economic development efforts and complex public/private partnerships,\u201d Mr. O'Brien said. \u201cI am involved in operations all the time.\n\u201cMy recommendation is based on a simple concept,\u201d he added. \u201cI must extricate myself from the implementation of these initiatives and day-to-day operations and have them addressed by an assistant city manager. I must shift and dedicate far more time to new initiatives, more significant reforms, and securing neighborhood revitalization partnerships in specific neighborhoods under strain.\nDistrict 5 Councilor William J. Eddy and Councilor-at-Large Michael J.

They said gangs had threatened to kidnap them, and they begged her to help them flee to the United States. She borrowed $6,000 and wired the money to a series of guides in Guatemala and Mexico. On Saturday, her kids called again \u2014 from a U.S. detention facility in Arizona. This time, there were no tears.\n\u201cThank God they are safe now. It all happened so fast,\u201d said Cabrera, who sells homemade tortillas in the District. Although she is in the country illegally, she said she has been contacted by federal authorities so that both children can eventually be released to her custody. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a miracle,\u201d she marveled.\nU.S. officials are scrambling to understand and manage the exodus of unaccompanied minors from Central America who have turned up at the southern U.S. border over the past few months. The surge has overwhelmed detention facilities, forcing the Obama administration to take emergency measures to provide shelter, hire attorneys and locate sponsors to receive the children.\nThe number of such minors entering the United States has crept upward since 2011, but last fall it began to skyrocket. Since October, 47,000 have arrived; officials expect another 60,000 by the end of this year.\nThe new surge is partly seasonal, with early summer being the easiest time to travel across the region. But it is mainly driven by two other factors. One is an epidemic of gang violence across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala that has put many children at risk, especially when parents are not there to protect them. The second is a perception, fueled by certain U.S. policies and by critics of the Obama administration, that the government is treating young illegal immigrants with unprecedented leniency.\nAs a result, thousands of parents like Cabrera sense both an urgent need and a unique opportunity to be reunited with children they left behind years ago to flee conflict or seek a better life. With no legal means to import their children from abroad, many of these undocumented families are putting their hopes in an unexpected source of salvation: the U.S. immigration system.\nDriven by a mix of rumor, fact and political hyperbole, word has spread through Latino communities in the Washington area and elsewhere that if their children reach the U.S. border alone, they will be allowed to go free.\nThe families\u2019 hopes are partly justified because officials have sped up processing the new arrivals to relieve crowded shelters and release as many as possible to relatives or guardians. Unlike children from Mexico, who can be sent back across the border right away, the law allows minors arriving from more distant countries to be sheltered and then handed over to a sponsor while awaiting court hearings.\nThe Washington region, with more than 400,000 residents of Central American origin, is one of several metropolitan areas in the United States where the newly arrived minors are most likely to be sent. Social and legal aid agencies said they have helped hundreds of families petition to receive minors from border detention over the past year.\nBut the speculation that these minors simply will be set free is unfounded. All of them are subject to deportation, and none are eligible for the administration\u2019s Dream Act program, which allows some illegal youths to remain if they have lived in the United States for at least five years and can meet other requirements.

More than 20 African ambassadors watched approvingly from the gallery during the vote.\nThe legislation now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it quickly.\nMost of the measure's provisions will not take effect for several months, until trade officials can determine which countries and products are eligible for new privileges.\nSupporters cheered today's passage as an important first step to build broader commercial and diplomatic ties between the United States and some of the world's most impoverished nations. Opponents, largely from textile states in the South and New England, warned of crippling job losses for American workers.\n''We're doing something for Africa besides sending peace forces or aid,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and one of the bill's chief sponsors.\nThe legislation would be the first major trade measure enacted in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which set up the World Trade Organization.\nThe measure is separate from an even more contentious China trade bill before Congress, but Mr. Clinton and other supporters of the China bill hope that approval of the Africa-Caribbean measure will build momentum for the larger legislation.\nThe House is to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, but the outcome is considered too close to call.\nThe Africa-Caribbean compromise drew broad bipartisan support today after months of backroom haggling and after last rites were read over the legislation more than once.\nSupporters said the measure would help African nations diversify their trade with the United States to include apparel and textiles, and translate into $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 jobs for the United States over the next five years. Oil, platinum, diamonds and gold make up about 80 percent of current African exports to United States.\nLast year, the House and Senate approved different versions of the measure. Since then negotiators have sought a compromise.\nUnder today's deal, worked out with the help of the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48 African nations will get.\nThe House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation because of objections from lawmakers in textile states. But senators felt strongly about correcting an unintended consequence of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which diverted much American investment to Mexico from the Caribbean.\nIn return, the Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the United States.\nIn a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile imports. That cap rises to 3.5 percent over eight years."}
{"idx": "22610", "prompt": "Continue the following text: US President Donald Trump\u2019s announced plans to target China with trade tariffs represent a significant departure from his predecessors\u2019 approach. China is now seen primarily as an economic adversary, rather than an economic partner. That may be a difference of degree rather than kind: Trump\u2019s policies are the culmination of a decade of US trade frustration.\nThe sources of US frustration are well known. Since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China has been accused of failing to meet its market-access obligations, and even of having regressed in some areas. Moreover, China is believed to have long used state intervention, including industrial policy, to limit US businesses and investment in the domestic market, while enabling Chinese enterprises to achieve rapid technological progress.\nMore fundamentally, however, the US is concerned that China\u2019s rapid economic development now poses a real challenge to America\u2019s global influence. This has fuelled a sense that China must be \u201ccontained\". In Trump\u2019s view, part of the solution is trade protectionism.\nIn the 1980s, protectionist US policies successfully contained the growth of Japan, which, like China today, maintained a large trade surplus with the US. But those policies\u2019 success was rooted partly in Japan\u2019s problematic policy choices, including slow fiscal and monetary responses. In order to reduce the bilateral trade surplus, Japan introduced voluntary export restraints, which hollowed out its real economy, while providing excessive protection to its non-tradable sectors. The result was a decades-long recession.\nBut trade patterns have changed so much since the 1980s, particularly owing to the emergence of regional and global supply chains, that the very notion of a bilateral trade imbalance\u2014one of the main sticking points for Trump\u2014seems outdated. After all, the added value China actually derives from its exports is not nearly as large as its trade surplus.\nIn fact, over the last decade, China\u2019s global current-account surplus has shrunk at an unprecedented rate, falling from 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to a mere 1.4% today. Meanwhile, there has been little change in the US trade imbalance, indicating that America\u2019s massive deficit is not China\u2019s fault at all. In fact, the blame lies squarely with US macroeconomic realities, namely a low rate of domestic saving and a high rate of federal borrowing, which Trump\u2019s tax cuts will cause to increase further.\nChina recognizes the absurdity of the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with forcing it to reduce the bilateral trade surplus. But it also knows that a trade war would not be good for anyone. To ease frictions, China\u2019s leaders have promised to increase imports and open up the domestic market, with President Xi Jinping predicting $8 trillion worth of merchandise imports within the next five years.\nThis is a smart move, and not just because it will help appease the US, as well as European countries that have complained about limited access to the Chinese market, not to mention international financial institutions. As underscored in a joint statement of the US and China regarding trade consultations, \u201csignificantly\" increased Chinese purchases of foreign\u2014in particular, US\u2014goods and services will also enable the country \u201cto meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development\".\nChina imported $2 trillion worth of goods in 2017, of which consumer goods accounted for only 8.8%.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 call to ban \u201cfracking\u201d advanced Tuesday in the House and Senate as environmentalists argue the proposals don\u2019t go far enough and the petroleum industry fights to allow the controversial drilling technique.\nWith the groups opposing the bills for different reasons, some lawmakers were left explaining their support as the House Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee voted 10-2 to ban \u201chydraulic fracturing\u201d for oil and natural gas (HB 7029). Later, the Senate Innovation, Industry, and Technology Committee narrowly approved a broader version (SB 7064) that includes provisions on drilling in the Everglades.\nThe acidizing technique uses many of the same chemicals as in fracking, but it dissolves rocks with acid instead of fracturing them with pressurized liquid.\nThe narrow definition is not included in the Senate version. But the Senate bill seeks to provide oil-drilling protections for the Everglades. That move is a reaction to an ongoing legal battle over a Broward County landowner\u2019s plan to drill an exploratory oil well on about five acres in the Everglades. The exploratory well would not involve fracking.\nStill, environmentalists remain opposed to the House and Senate proposals and the possibility of allowing the matrix acidizing technique. Environmentalists contend that fracking threatens Florida\u2019s water supplies and can affect agricultural production and cause environmental damage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fracking ban until all forms of fracking are banned,\u201d said Kim Ross, executive director of Rethink Energy Florida.\nGladys Delgadillo, environmental policy specialist for the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, pointed to concerns that the public will feel safe from fracking when the omission of matrix acidizing leaves \u201cwiggle words\u201d that could be used by the petroleum industry to engage in the practice.\nThe Florida Petroleum Council contends that fracking is safe, can boost oil and gas production and helps hold down energy costs for consumers.\nMica, noting most people are unaware that oil production has occurred for decades in Florida, added there is no need for the legislative action as DeSantis could ask the state Department of Environmental Protection to enact a rule change about fracking.\nRep. Rick Roth, R-Loxahatchee, acknowledged being \u201ctroubled\u201d in supporting a bill opposed by the petroleum industry, which he credited for improving the nation\u2019s energy independence and for cleaning the environment by helping move from coal-fired power plants to gas-fired plants.\nBut he said there are concerns from his neighbors about contaminating the state\u2019s water supply, and the bill could help the industry\u2019s public relations.\n\u201cI think this bill does part of that, saying we are concerned in Florida about contaminating our water supply by injecting water down into wells to do the fracturing,\u201d Roth said.\nNo fracking.

But this untold story underscores the effect the Russian operation had on the American electoral system.\nWhy the Russian government might care about these unglamorous House races is a source of bafflement for some of the lawmakers who were targeted. But if the goal of Russian President Vladimir Putin was to make American democracy a less attractive model to his own citizens and to Russia\u2019s neighbors, then entangling congressional races in accusations of leaks and subterfuge was a step in the right direction.\nThe intrusions in House races in states including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and North Carolina can be traced to tens of thousands of pages of documents taken from the DCCC, which shares a Capitol Hill office building with the Democratic National Committee.\nThe document dump\u2019s effectiveness was due in part to a de facto alliance that formed between the Russian hackers and political bloggers and newspapers across the United States. The hackers, working under the made-up name Guccifer 2.0, used social media tools to invite individual reporters to request specific caches of documents, handing them out the way political operatives distribute scoops. It was an arrangement that proved irresistible to many news outlets \u2014 and amplified the consequences of the cyberattack.\nCybersecurity consultants believe the hacking of the DCCC took place around March or April of 2016 after a staffer clicked on a so-called phishing email. The DCCC shut down its computer system for a week \u2014 from the moment it learned of the attack in June. But it was already too late to close the door. The consequences started to become clear in August when the hackers released the home addresses, cellphone numbers and personal email addresses of Democratic House members.\nState troopers were sent to the homes of House Democrats across the United States, and they were urged to immediately change their cellphone numbers and personal email addresses, although this took place after many received a series of obscene calls, texts and emails.\nBut it turned out this was just a warning shot.\nGuccifer 2.0 followed up on the release of lawmakers\u2019 personal data with large caches of internal party documents, starting with some documents related to House races in Florida, including Taddeo\u2019s contest.\nThe seats that Guccifer 2.0 targeted in the document dumps were hardly random: They were some of the most competitive House races in the country. In Taddeo\u2019s district, the House seat is held by a Republican, even though the district leans Democratic and Clinton won it this year by a large majority.\nTo prepare for the race, the DCCC had done candid evaluations of the two candidates vying in the primary for the nomination.

Serious repression and the export of high-tech weapons are still Maoist Beijing's stock in trade.\nChinese leader Li Peng intended to put Tiananmen Square behind him on his recent visit to the United Nations in New York, where President Bush met with him for 20 minutes. But the trip coincided with a number of embarrassments for Li. A State Department human-rights report described torture of Chinese prisoners, terrible prison conditions for thousands, and labor camps filled with perhaps hundreds of thousands of Chinese.\nThen came reports that, contrary to the agreement Secretary of State Baker got in Beijing last fall, China was exporting missile technology to Pakistan and Syria.\nWhat approach should Washington take? This month a compromise House-Senate bill that would remove most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status from China comes before the Senate. The bill is milder than previous versions. For China to retain its $15 billion trade surplus with the US, it must free all Tiananmen prisoners (800 are left) and cease exports of high-tech weapons.\nExpectations are that this popular bipartisan bill will pass the Senate. In all likelihood the president will veto it, however. White House policy has been to promote contact between the West and China. Bush believes this contact, more than anything, will open China up at the grass roots level. That's generally true. A retributive policy might shut China's doors and hurt reformers. The Soviet breakup has made China's leaders paranoid already.\nYet a balance is needed for the US not to be exploited. Li Peng made great domestic gains from the chilly meeting with Bush. A host of issues lie unresolved: When will China sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as promised? Has there been any progress on China's legion of unfair trade practices? Any lessening of slave labor? Any curbing of M-9 missile exports?\nWe support contact between China and the West. But if he vetoes the House-Senate bill, the president must say that next year MFN extension will be conditional on fair trade, human rights, and a halt to missile-technology exports. Deng Xiaoping is said to have begun a liberalizing campaign at home. But words count less than deeds. Let's see some change, not statements. The next Communist Party Congress determines the kind of leaders China will get. If change doesn't come, Bush should finally get tough."}

Hurts calmly guided the No. 1 Crimson Tide (13-0) to a game-tying touchdown with a 10-yard pass to Jerry Jeudy, capping a 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed more than 7 minutes .\nAfter No. 4 Georgia (11-2) was stuffed on a fake punt near midfield, Hurts took matters into his own hands for the winning score. Spotting an opening up the middle, he took off on a 15-yard TD run with 1:04 remaining .\nThis was a reversal of the storyline from last season's national title game, when Tagovailoa replaced an ineffective Hurts at the start of the second half with Alabama trailing Georgia 13-0. The replacement threw three touchdown passes, including a 41-yarder in overtime that gave the Tide a stunning 26-23 victory.\nTagovailoa won the starting job in preseason practice and performed brilliantly during the regular season, throwing 36 touchdown passes with only two interceptions.\nThe SEC title game took a different path. Georgia put quite a beating on Tagovailoa, who was picked off twice, spent much of his spare time in the medical tent and was largely ineffective as the Bulldogs built a pair of two-touchdown leads.\nThis time, it was Hurts who bailed out the Crimson Tide. When he trotted off the field after the winning TD, Tagovailoa was one of the first ones to greet him on the sideline . Afterward, they stood side-by-side on the podium in the middle of the field while Alabama received its SEC championship trophy.\nNow, the Crimson Tide is headed back to the College Football Playoff, looking for its second straight national title and the sixth of the last decade under Saban.\nGeorgia can make a pretty good case for the playoff, too, but the Bulldogs will likely get left out.

IRS began requiring large corporations and tax-exempt organizations to e-file via the MeF last year. It also added the federal-state single-point filing system platform to MeF last year.\nThe latest release experienced problems with high volumes early in the 2006 tax season but was able to process peak tax-return volume in September. The IRS also deferred 53 of the project's requirements to later versions, said a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\nOf the deferred requirements, the MeF project team has delayed completion of its ability to display return information within a certain time period until Release 4. The ability to display returns ensures the efficiency of IRS personnel who access returns through the MeF system, TIGTA said in its report.\nOther deferred requirements include capabilities to create and store system error messages, capture audit trails and monitor infrastructure transactions and processes.\n'The MeF project's plans for processing additional tax forms are uncertain,' said Michael Phillips, TIGTA's deputy inspector general for audit.\nBetter management of MeF's expected capabilities and associated costs will improve the IRS' prospects for meeting the 1040 goal, TIGTA said. The definition of requirements should incorporate the plans and concepts for the IRS' five-year IT Modernization Vision and Strategy. IRS also should include the content of each release, expected deployment dates and anticipated funding for the release work.\nThe IRS agreed with most recommendations, but said it already had defined a sequencing plan, including implementing Release 5 in January 2008, and was implementing it.\n'The current sequencing plan outlines the development and deployment of the 1040 family of forms across three releases with the implementation of the first release scheduled for 2009. Implementation of this plan is dependent upon the amount of approved funding provided to the MeF project,' said IRS CIO Richard Spires in a response.\nUsing fixed-price task orders, however, should occur after each release's design is decided, IRS said. It will evaluate whether using fixed-price contracts for Release 6 is appropriate.\n'The MeF project cannot enter into fixed-price arrangements until it receives all required funding. The service must enter into fixed-price contracts with appropriated rather than anticipated funding,' Spires said.\nThe CIO disagreed with TIGTA's recommendation to identify the cost effects of deferring significant project release requirements to future releases. TIGTA responded back that it was concerned about the absence of controls to assign and track project requirement costs. Spires said that that was not an appropriate or productive use of resources. The IRS performs an impact assessment to determine the best way to use deferred requirement efforts in the future. The IRS, however, tracks the associated costs of deferred requirements in the development of its relational taxpayer database, the Customer Account Data Engine, TIGTA said."}

Or, should they invest significant resources in up-skilling their employees that will have their jobs eliminated with automation and prepare them for their next, different-in-kind role?

The only other player in franchise history to do so was linebacker Kevin Greene in 1997, during a snit over a raise then-general manager Bill Polian wasn't going to give him. That set the stage for Greene's eventual release.\nBut while money's at least partly the reason Jenkins stayed away this summer as well, the Panthers won't repeat history.\nWhat he won't have when he arrives is a new contract. That's been his goal since the spring, and when Detroit gave defensive tackle Cory Redding a seven-year, $49 million deal last week ($20 million guaranteed), it added fuel to the speculative fire regarding Jenkins' status. There's no movement on a new deal, and most league observers said he needed to show up in shape and repeat last year's Pro Bowl-level play to even have a chance at another payday. He's under contract through 2009 on the six-year, $31 million extension he signed in 2003.\nOne agent who has similar players in his stable -- and is familiar with the way the Panthers work -- said Jenkins has little leverage since he's only played one full season in the last three because of injuries, and days away from his 28th birthday is considered a player in decline rather than one on the rise.\n\"Giving Jenkins a new deal right now would be like buying a '93 Ferrari,\" the agent said. \"Sure it's a beautiful car, and not too many people have one like it. But you just don't know how long you can run it hard before it breaks down.\"\n&#8226; SPEAKING OF CONTRACTS: Folks are quick to link defensive end Julius Peppers' contract status to the new six-year, $72 million deal signed by Indianapolis end Dwight Freeney recently. That pact contained $30 million in guarantees, making Freeney the highest-paid defender in the league.\nPeppers has made clear that he doesn't really care about Freeney's deal since he doesn't view him as a comparable player. That will extend to the bargaining table as well, as most expect his next contract to be significantly larger than his Colts counterpart's.\n\"The reason that I have not signed an extension with the Panthers has nothing to do with Dwight Freeney,\" Peppers told The Herald in a March e-mail. \"I don't know where people get the notion that I am waiting on him before I sign my next contract. He might be waiting on me, but my contract does not expire until after the 2008 season. Furthermore, I wouldn't compare my value as a player to Freeney or anyone else because I see myself as a complete defensive end and not just a pass-rusher.\"\nThe Panthers have made keeping Peppers a priority, and there have been discussions toward that goal for months.

The Super Bowl was a bust, but at least the Nuggets woke up in first place in the loaded Western Conference. The postseason will be here in little more than two months, and until that time, Nuggets insider Mike Singer and columnist Mark Kiszla will have a running debate on the state of the team.\nQuestion: Is something wrong with Paul Millsap or is this slump his new normal?\nKiz: There are 99 reasons why Michael Malone is a legit candidate for coach of the year. He has won more than 70 percent of Denver\u2019s games with a patchwork lineup and an inconsistent supporting cast for Nikola Jokic. Case in point: Paul Millsap. In 19 games since returning in late December from a broken toe, Millsap has averaged 9.9 points and 5.8 rebounds in 25 minutes. So here\u2019s the $30 million question: What\u2019s the dang deal with Millsap?\nSinger: I had heard you had an affinity for Millsap! Look, there are only 11 guys in the NBA making more money than Millsap this season, and the list is littered with All-Stars and future Hall of Famers. It\u2019s possible his broken toe is still bothering him, but it\u2019s not like he was lighting it up pre-injury, either. Millsap isn\u2019t an ideal fit on offense; his 3-point shooting plummeted in January, and he\u2019s not one of the cutters benefitting from Jokic\u2019s elite passing. His biggest value is on the defensive end where he\u2019s still versatile enough to switch on frontcourt opponents, offer help defense and cover for Jokic around the rim.\nKiz: OK, I get why the Nuggets signed Millsap. They valued his defense, professionalism and veteran savvy. But most of all, the Nuggets were desperate to show they could convince a big-name free agent to say \u201cyes\u201d to Denver. But can we agree the Nuggets grossly overpaid to get one of the NBA\u2019s cool kids to sit at their table? And here\u2019s the more serious question: How big a role should we expect Millsap to play as Denver fights for the top playoff seed in the West?\nSinger: When the Nuggets landed Millsap he was coming off four consecutive All-Star Games, so they were never going to get him for cheap. But he has regressed substantially the past two years, partly a result of injuries to his wrist and foot, partly a result of fit. I still think Malone will start games with Millsap in the lineup, but whether he finishes them with him or Mason Plumlee is an interesting question. At this point, he\u2019s probably the fifth-most important player on their roster. But, he\u2019s also the only one with any extended postseason experience.\nKiz: When it\u2019s crunch time, I fully expect Malone will hand out minutes to players based on merit, not on the basis of the size of their paychecks.

They also expect Ford's automotive-segment revenue to come in at $33.68 billion, roughly flat from $33.65 billion in the year-ago period.\nFord's F-Series pickups continue to sell well and generate good profits, thanks to high-margin versions like this F-150 Limited. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nHow did Ford's sales fare in the third quarter?\nFord does business in over 100 countries, but the U.S., China, and the 20 countries that make up western and central Europe (what Ford refers to as the \"Euro 20\") together account for the vast majority of its global sales.\nIn the U.S., where the overall market declined about 2.2% in the third quarter, Ford's sales fell 3.7% over the same period. Ford's pickups have done well all year, but its sedan sales have dropped sharply. And recently, its SUVs have come under some pressure. Ford is about a year away from all-new versions of the Escape and Explorer, its two best-selling SUVs; sales of the outgoing models might be sluggish until then, unless Ford boosts its incentives.\nFor comparison: General Motors' (NYSE:GM) U.S. sales fell 11.1% in the third quarter, Toyota's (NYSE:TM) fell 6.1%, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE:FCAU) rose 10.2%.\nIn China, where Ford is in the midst of a major restructuring, its sales were down 37.2% from a year ago. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war is part of the problem, but Ford's issues run deeper. The company has a slew of new products for China on the way, and it's revamping its dealer-support efforts while cutting costs and streamlining product development, But results might not begin to be visible until later in 2019.\nGM's sales in China declined 14.9% in the third quarter, and Volkswagen's (NASDAQOTH:VWAGY) fell 2.2%.\nIn Europe, Ford's sales rose slightly (0.6%) in the third quarter. Like most of its rivals, Ford saw its sales sag in September after strong results in July and August.\nVolkswagen's sales in Europe also rose slightly (0.2%) in the third quarter.\nIn sum, there were few surprises here. Ford's high-profit F-Series pickups did well, as did its new-last-year full-size SUVs; both will drive good profits in North America. Sales in Europe appear to have remained strong, but Ford's ability to deliver good profits on those European sales is in question after a disappointing (and surprising) second-quarter result. And in China, where Ford barely broke even in the second quarter, it looks likely that results will be disappointing for a while longer.\nFord announced in September that it had recalled certain F-150 pickups made between 2015 and 2018 to repair defective seat belt pre-tensioners.

{"idx": "22642", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Last week, co-blogger Nick Weaver posted a short summary of why he holds the view that Apple products are safe, but that Android products systematically are not. His recommendation was to throw your Android phone in the garbage and he asked, somewhat rhetorically, what could be done about the situation.\nThis response, however, drew an interesting question from co-blogger Dave Aitel. He asked, \"What about transparency?,\" by which I take him to mean, \"What about a requirement or incentive program to urge smartphone manufacturers to disclose the nature of the code they are using so that observers can judge the adequacy of the code and make informed purchasing decisions based on those disclosures?\" Transparency is often thought of as a way of adding better information to markets to make them function more accurately. It is seen most frequently as the response to a phenomenon known as \"information asymmetry\" (i.e. a situation where one party to the transaction knows more about the transaction than the other does\u2014in this case the phone manufacturer knows more about the phone's code weaknesses than the purchaser). I told David that the answer required a blog post\u2014and here it is. Some (though by no means all) of this answer is likely generalizable to all code-based products.\nTo begin with, it isn't clear that knowledge of the Android weakness is actually an information asymmetry that needs rectification. As Nick points out, the Android weakness is pretty widely known at a high level of generality (virtually every lecture I give is accompanied by the question: \u201cIs Apple really safer?\u201d) and it isn't clear that more detail would be useful to decision makers. It seems pretty clear that purchasers are preferring familiarity, convenience, and price over security. That's precisely why there aren't a lot of Android phones in the dumpsters. And it is actually a sign that the market for information is functioning well. This seems at first blush to be a classic case of a market failure where the preferences and choices of individual actors create externalities (system insecurity) that do not maximize collective social utility. A particularly poignant example of this failure is in the Android-ransomware space where, as Dave Aitel says, we are reaching a tipping point. So at first blush, I'm not sure transparency would matter at all from an economic perspective.\nBut let's assume for sake of argument that the premise of David's question is correct and that greater transparency/disclosure would improve information flows and work to correct a market that is plagued by the asymmetry of the manufacturer's information. Fair enough. But it is still not necessarily a soluble problem, even if we were to conclude that it was worth addressing.\nThe reason in this case is that cures for information asymmetry only work if the recipient has adequate capacity to accept, interpret, and act on the disclosed information. In the commercial context (sales to big corporations, for example), that probably is not the case today but it is possible. Software disclosure requirements would let large institutional purchasers exercise their market power with better information. It would, however, require a significant investment of resources\u2014code auditors, lawyers to enforce promises, insurers, etc. It is at least an open question whether those costs would result in greater benefits through more secure Android phones or whether the transactions costs incurred would exceed the benefits. And the only way to make that empirical judgment is, sadly, to run the real world experiment.\nI confess to an instinct that the benefits would be greater than the costs\u2014but part of my instinct involves the anticipation of free riders, and I'm not sure if we will see them in the cyber context.

Attorney General Alan Wilson wrote a letter to Condon questioning whether the \u201cuse of public funds for criminal defense expenses\u201d is legal under the state Constitution.\nSantee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore could not be reached for comment Thursday evening.\nBut in a previous email to The State, Gore wrote the five outside attorneys aren\u2019t acting only as \u201ccriminal defense\u201d attorneys. They also are helping the executives navigate civil lawsuits accusing Santee Cooper of mismanaging the failed nuclear project.\nSantee Cooper pays the attorney fees as part of a longstanding indemnification policy designed to protect employees or board members who haven\u2019t been charged with a crime but are involved in a legal matter because of their position with the utility, Gore wrote.\nThe Thursday letter is the latest episode in McMaster\u2019s ongoing beef with Santee Cooper.\nThe Richland Republican has pushed lawmakers since August 2017 \u2014 days after the V.C.

That long-secret document turned out to be a smoking gun that showed SCE&G and Santee Cooper executives were aware of \u2014 yet failed to disclose publicly \u2014 serious problems plaguing the project.\nLater that year, McMaster successfully pushed then-Santee Cooper board chairman Leighton Lord to resign after accusing him of withholding crucial information, including the Bechtel report, related to the utility\u2019s role in the project.\nIn March, the governor\u2019s office released a trove of internal Santee Cooper emails that showed the agency\u2019s lobbying team secretly was trying to undermine the governor by working to persuade lawmakers not to sell the utility. McMaster then called a press conference and labeled Santee Cooper a \u201crogue agency,\u201d again calling on lawmakers to sell the utility.\nThe attorneys counseling the executives were paid $475 an hour.\nThe utility also incurred other legal bills stemming from the cost of defending itself.\nNo one at Santee Cooper \u2014 or SCANA, for that matter \u2014 has been charged with a crime related to the V.C.

{"idx": "22645", "prompt": "Continue the following text: What Is the Healthiest Bottled Water?\nStyrofoam cups are commonly used for hot drinks or liquid meals such as soup. While Styrofoam is convenient to use, there are some concerns about the potential health risks associated with the material. Styrofoam is particularly unsafe when heated or used with hot liquids and has been associated with some cancers and well as other potential health problems.\nStyrofoam is actually a commercial term, but the name has come to refer to any food or drink containers that are made of polystyrene. Polystyrene is used to serve hot liquids like coffee or soup because it insulates the liquid and stays cool on the outside so the drinker will not burn his hand. Unfortunately, hot liquids or microwave use can cause the Styrofoam to melt or break down, causing the chemicals benzene and styrene to leach into the liquid inside. The person drinking the liquid in turn ingests the chemicals, which can cause health problems.\nThe chemicals found in Styrofoam are possible carcinogens and can contribute to a variety of cancers including breast and prostate cancer. Cancer is not the only health issue associated with polystyrene. Styrene can mimic the properties of the female hormone estrogen and cause thyroid problems as well as menstrual irregularities. Excessive exposure to styrene can also affect a person's central nervous system, resulting in general fatigue, headaches, depression and kidney problems. Other effects of styrene exposure include skin and eye irritation, gastrointestinal problems, low hemoglobin and platelet counts, and abnormalities with chromosomes and the lymphatic system.\nNo matter what container you are using, you must be careful of burning or scalding yourself or someone else when carrying or drinking from a cup filled with hot liquid. Since polystyrene cups remain cool to the touch on the outside, it is easy to forget that scalding hot liquid may be inside. Also, their flexible nature makes it easy to spill liquid when squeezing them too hard or if you're trying to snap on a plastic lid. Take precautions not to spill your cup when drinking a hot liquid and be sure to keep your Styrofoam cup away from children or pets.\nWhen possible, the best alternative to Styrofoam is a reusable ceramic cup. Ceramic cups are reusable, making them safer from an environmental standpoint, and also won't leach any dangerous chemicals into your drink. Wax-lined paper cups are another good alternative. While they don't keep as cool on the outside and will not provide thermal insulation, like ceramic cups they will not leach any styrene."}

In truth, this biannual list isn\u2019t about the best places to retire, it\u2019s about the best cities for aging successfully. There\u2019s a big difference. \u201cYou won\u2019t see the word \u2018retirement\u2019 anyplace in the title of our report,\u201d says Paul Irving, President of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Milken Institute.\nThe Milken Institute list doesn\u2019t just call out places with sunny climates and acres of golf courses. Instead, The Best Cities for Successful Aging researchers pore over 84 data indicators (up from 78 in 2012) in eight categories (from financial to health care to community engagement). Then they weight them on what they \u2014 and the Milken Institute\u2019s Advisory Committee \u2014 determine are the quality-of-life factors that matter most to Americans over 65.\nTo better reflect what makes a successful-aging city, this year\u2019s rankings include new data, such as the average wait time in a hospital emergency room, special needs transportation availability, the number of local movie theaters, the cost of adult day care and the rate of both falls and obesity rates of residents 65 and older.\nTo make its city rankings even more useful, the Milken Institute separates the 100 biggest U.S. metropolitan areas from the 252 smaller ones and then creates rankings for each of those two lists. After all, it\u2019s not really fair to compare a place with 3 million people to one with 30,000.\nWhat\u2019s so great about the college towns Madison (University of Wisconsin) and Iowa City (University of Iowa)?\nThe Milken report lauds Madison for, among other things, its high employment growth and low poverty rate for older adults; a low crime rate; quality health care; intellectual engagement at UW; low rates of smoking, falls and diabetes among older people; and an abundance of recreational and fitness activities. But Madison is faulted for expensive living and a lack of convenient grocery stores for older adults.\nThe Milken Institute says Iowa City \u201cnailed it\u201d for having an outstanding health system; a high public transportation ridership rate (among small metros); a relatively low obesity rate; high job growth; and many working older adults. It\u2019s \u201can attractive option for encore careers,\u201d notes the report.\nYou may have noticed a preponderance of places in the Midwest in both lists. \u201cThey have very strong economies, high rates of employment and are relatively low cost,\u201d says Irving. \u201cIn some circumstances, they have very strong health systems.\"\nAnother thing I like about the Milken Institute rankings: its separate lists of cities for Americans age 65 to 79 and for people 80+.\n\u201cWhat a 65-year-old needs and an 80-year-old needs is a little different,\u201d says Chatterjee. Certain factors (such as the economy, job opportunities and cultural amenities) matter more to those in their 60s and 70s and others (such as health care) are more significant to those in their 80s or older.

The Seminoles\u2019 defense is pretty easy to read: they can\u2019t stop the pass but bottle up the run; their pass defense is 121st in the FBS (282.6 yards allowed per game) but a very respectable 17th vs. the ground game (111.1 yards). Brandon Wimbush, the Notre Dame starter should Book be unavailable, lost his job after Week 3 because of his struggles throwing in the absence of the same punishing ground attack the Fighting Irish used to open things up in 2017. Wimbush is completing just 55.3 percent of his passes this year, with one touchdown and four interceptions \u2013 the same number Book has thrown on 128 more attempts. The Wimbush-led offense put up 24, 24 and 22 points this year, those latter two games coming to Ball State and Vanderbilt.\nAll that is to say this: Wimbush is unlikely to throw all over Florida State, meaning this will be a lower-scoring game that the Seminoles can steal. If they do, it will bring much-needed good vibes to Willie Taggart\u2019s program that has experienced a bumpy ride in his first year in Tallahassee. It would even give them an outside chance to extend their bowl streak. Bigger picture, a Notre Dame loss would throw the College Football Playoff race into chaos, creating a wild last few weeks and perhaps the most contentious top four debate yet.\nTennessee beats Kentucky to notch the second strong win of Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s first season. This would qualify as an upset: Tennessee is 4-5 and Kentucky is 7-2 after last week\u2019s loss to Georgia. And while the Volunteers have been up and down for the entire year, this seems like the sort of matchup where the Volunteers\u2019 home-field advantage might provide the difference.\nArkansas\u2019 season under first-year coach Chad Morris has been disappointing. The Hogs\u2019 postseason plans don\u2019t include a bowl game (in part because their season doesn\u2019t currently include an SEC victory). But in Fayetteville, they\u2019ll catch LSU coming off that 29-0 shellacking by Alabama, and they\u2019ll find a way to hand the Tigers a second consecutive loss.\nRivalry games are a different animal, even if one team is heavily favored. Both Georgia and Oklahoma are expected to have easy days against Auburn and Oklahoma State at home, respectively. But that's not always how things go, especially with a motivated underdog.\nThe Tigers have the defense to slow down the run game of the Bulldogs and force quarterback Jake Fromm to beat them. LSU employed the same strategy with effectiveness last month. The key will be if Jarrett Stidham can make enough plays for the Auburn offense to possess the ball and give its defense a break.\nWe've seen"}

Kelly, the Rams\u2019 rookie running back, laughed at the reminder, but with an I\u2019ll-show-you edge.\nThe Rams concluded training camp at UC Irvine on Thursday morning, and few players improved their stock in the past three weeks more than Kelly, a sixth-round pick out of Tennessee. Technically, Kelly still is in a fight for a roster spot, but should an injury befell Todd Gurley, Kelly might be the one to step in.\nKelly earned strong praise last week in Baltimore when, as the Rams\u2019 third-string back, he gained 77 yards on 13 second-half carries. That included a pitch play that ended up in a cut-back, field-crossing, 40-yard gain.\nAnother chance arrives Saturday afternoon when the Rams play Oakland in a preseason game at the Coliseum. Gurley is unlikely to play and second-string back Malcolm Brown will get minimal work. Third-stringer Justin Davis is expected to be out with a hamstring injury, so Kelly should have an expanded role.\nKelly\u2019s national profile is low, but that\u2019s nothing new. A three-star recruit out of high school, Kelly toiled for two years as Alvin Kamara\u2019s backup at Tennessee, but he averaged 6.4 yards per carry as a sophomore. Last season, with Kamara in the NFL, Kelly totaled 1,077 yards from scrimmage and nine touchdowns.\nPerhaps motivated by a coaching change, Kelly declared for the draft after his junior season and solid ratings at the combine didn\u2019t prevent him from falling to the sixth round. He landed well, though.\nThe Rams are set with Gurley, last year\u2019s NFL Offensive Player of the Year. Brown is a dependable but not particularly dynamic back. Davis is intriguing but often is injured. So Kelly entered a situation with opportunity and said his slide into the sixth round provided some extra motivation.\nIf the Rams start the season with three running backs on their 53-man roster, as they did last season, the battle for a roster spot figures to come down to Davis and Kelly. Davis made the cut last year, as an undrafted free agent out of USC, but he was active for only four of 16 games and had only one carry.\nDavis is well-regarded for his vision and quick cuts as a runner, but Kelly might be more of an all-around back. Gurley showed the value of that last season when he led the Rams with 64 receptions.\nIn conversation, Kelly presents a confident streak but also some rookie pragmatism. Asked about what type of role he thought he could fill with the Rams, Kelly first mentioned special teams. Listed at 5-foot-10, 205 pounds, Kelly has flashed deceptive speed and good footwork and has been singled out for praise by Coach Sean McVay.\nThursday\u2019s abbreviated practice marked the end of the Rams\u2019 training-camp time at UC Irvine. The team will return to its Cal Lutheran headquarters in Thousand Oaks next week. \u2026 Injured players such as receiver Josh Reynolds (ankle) and tight end Gerald Everett (shoulder) remain out of practice."}
{"idx": "22658", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Diana Krall is about the farthest thing from a jazz diva you could expect to find in a world where loud, pyrotechnic vocal display is confused with musical insight and emotional depth. This singer and pianist, who led her trio in a quietly enthralling concert on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, is a low-key jazz minimalist who takes the meaning of the word ''trio'' much more seriously than most singers.\nWorking with Russell Malone, a phenomenally fluent guitarist, and the bassist Ben Wolfe, Ms. Krall shapes popular standards into lovely, ever evolving instrumental conversations in which the music and rhythmic accents keep changing from one pastel hue to the next. On top of the trio's inventive musical dynamics, she brings a lyrical intelligence that is bracingly unsentimental.\nIn Ms. Krall's hands, ''All or Nothing at All'' wasn't a swooning ballad about giving in to love but a cool explanation of why she would continue to resist a lover's charms. Instead of a heart-pounding declaration, ''I've Got You Under My Skin'' became an expression of worry and possible regret about getting too deeply involved.\nThe most impressive and touching performance on Thursday was a subtly iconoclastic rendition of ''How Deep Is the Ocean?'' which Ms. Krall dedicated to her piano teacher Jimmy Rowles, who died two years ago. The trio's version of the Irving Berlin chestnut elided the song's eight-bar phrases so that the melody remained unbroken. The quieter Ms. Krall's singing became, the more feeling she projected.\nAs refreshing as it was, Ms. Krall's understatement seemed almost brutally self-effacing. A discreet showmanship does have its place in jazz, especially in jazz singing. But she appeared determined to keep her set as purely musical as possible, offering only the sparest commentary between numbers and never reaching out to an audience that gave her a partial standing ovation.\nGeorge Shearing, who performed during the second half of the evening with his trio, is as musically mild-mannered in his way as Ms. Krall. Appearing with Reg Schwager on guitar and Neil Swinson on bass, this 78-year-old English pianist played a pleasant, impeccably precise set that suggested the pacifying musical equivalent of comfort food.\nThe material ran to pretty tunes like ''Lollipops and Roses'' and ''Sunday, Monday or Always,'' in which the melodies in Mr. Shearing's blocked chords were doubled by the guitar to create bell-like sonorities. Genuine poignancy broke through the decorum only once, in ''Only the Lonely,'' Mr. Shearing's richly harmonized unaccompanied solo tribute to Frank Sinatra.\nA music review on Tuesday about performances by Diana Krall and by George Shearing's trio at Carnegie Hall on June 25 as part of the JVC Jazz Festival misspelled the surname of the trio's bass player. He is Neil Swainson, not Swinson."}

The automotive research firm iSeeCars says the following nine vehicles.\nThe conventional wisdom for car buyers is to skip the dealership's new vehicles and instead opt for lightly used models.\nThat way you avoid the painful depreciation hit (11 percent of the car's price on average) that kicks in the minute you drive your shiny new wheels off the lot.\nBut there are exceptions. Some cars greedily hang onto their value after one year. If you can get a new version of the car you want for a sum between 9 and 15 percent more than you would pay on the year-old used model, it can be smart to pull the trigger on the new wheels.\nOn average, a new car loses 26.8 percent of its value, or $7,654, in one year.\nAs Phong Ly, the CEO of the automotive data and research company iSeeCars, explains, buying new allows customers to take advantage of improved technology and safety features, and often a better warranty deal.\n\"When spread out over the length of a car loan at an average of 5.5 years, the slightly increased monthly payments can be offset by the added warranty and dealer incentives,\" Ly says.\niSeeCars.com analyzed more than 6 million cars sold between Aug. 1, 2017, and January 24, 2018, to determine which new cars hold their value the best.\nThe first part above gallery shows the top cars to buy new instead of used, according to the company. The second half lists the worst cars for buying new over used.\nThe value-retaining new cars are all SUVs and trucks, with the one exception a sports car, the Subaru WRX. The WRX is enjoying strong demand thanks to the 2017 film \"Baby Driver,\" in which it had a starring role.\nMost of the best vehicles to buy new are not particularly thrifty in the fuel department. In fact, some struggle to get 20 miles per gallon.\nWhile pump prices have been rising in recent months, they have been relatively low over the past few years, which may account for consumers' indifference to mpg ratings.\nAmong the worst vehicles to buy new vs. used are several luxury brands.\n\"Many luxury cars are leased by individuals or companies for fleet or management use and replaced with newer models, and this turnaround increases the number of used cars in the marketplace, causing a larger drop in price,\" Ly says.\nThe somewhat surprising inclusion of the Toyota Camry on the list is due to a major 2018 redesign, which included an overhauled power train, improved handling and a spiffier exterior. Suddenly one-year-old Camrys don't seem so attractive, so you can pick up a 2017 for about $8,000 less than new."}

But only one man knows for sure what the People\u2019s Bank of China was up to when the value of the renminbi fell last week.\nWhat\u2019s going on at China\u2019s central bank? The People\u2019s Bank of China, led by Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, has been slowly liberalizing currency and capital markets for several years now. Last week, though, it made a monetary policy move that surprised people around the world. A week later, those same people can\u2019t seem to agree on what it means.\nThe central bank has long allowed the exchange rate of the dollar and the renminbi, China\u2019s currency, to move within a band that has gotten slightly wider from year to year, until reaching its current range of 2 percent on either side of a fixed opening rate. But on August 11, for the first time, the bank began to let the band move in an apparently market-driven way from day to day. Every morning when trading began, the midpoint of the new band would be similar to the closing rate from the previous day.\nOver the next three days, the renminbi, also known as the yuan, lost about 3 percent of its value against the dollar. Western observers immediately cried foul, accusing China of devaluing its currency deliberately in an attempt to make its exports cheaper and boost its flagging economy. It was a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d or \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbor\u201d economics \u2014 the sort of thing that used to lead American politicians to accuse China of manipulating its currency.\nYet some China hands doubted this explanation. They pointed out that Beijing has been trying to gussy up the renminbi in advance of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) decision in November on whether to include the yuan in the basket that forms its own distinct currency, the Special Drawing Right. Inclusion would make little difference to China\u2019s economy in itself, but it would be a stamp of approval that the renminbi was on its way to being \u201cconvertible\u201d \u2014 freely usable and tradable around the world. The experts said China had taken a step toward allowing the renminbi\u2019s value to float on its own, and market forces had pushed down its value versus the dollar.\nThe clash between these two stories even pitted colleagues against each other. At the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., Nicholas Lardy blogged that China\u2019s move was a \u201cpotentially major step\u201d towards a free-floating currency. He followed up with another post asserting that the Chinese economy wasn\u2019t as weak as other experts believed, implicitly arguing that there was less reason for the government to want a devalued currency that would boost exports. But Adam Posen, the institute\u2019s president and a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, said he thought the devaluation was intentional \u2014 though he hoped Lardy was in fact correct.\nWho\u2019s right? The only way to know the Chinese central bank\u2019s true intentions is to find out exactly what it was up to last week. If the bank was injecting renminbi into the market in order to increase its supply, then the fall in the exchange rate was probably deliberate. But if the bank was sucking renminbi out of the market all along in order to support the currency \u2014 and then stopped last week \u2014 then the dip was just the currency finding its fair value. In that case, any boost for exporters was just a convenient bonus.\nGetting the whole truth seems simple enough, in theory.

The actor has been in the business of making films so long \u2013 his debut on the big screen was in 1965 \u2013 that his work is now being restored.\n\"Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Restored, huh? It's kind of amazing,\" he says, sitting in his production hub in downtown Manhattan, the Tribeca Film Centre.\nThe restoration in question is the painstaking return to its original glory of King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese's dark 1982 satire on modern celebrity obsession, with its famous punchline: \"Better to be king for a night, than schmuck for a lifetime.\" The movie has been digitally remastered from the original camera negatives and will be shown later this month on the closing night of this year's Tribeca film festival, with both De Niro and Scorsese in attendance.\n\"Rupert Pupkin, now what film was that one?\" De Niro quips, feigning to have forgotten the part of the self-delusional would-be standup he played 30 years ago. \"I haven't seen the movie in at least 20 years, and I want to see it \u2013 it will bring back memories not just of what I did in the movie, but of that period in my life,\" he says.\nKing of Comedy will be one of the highlights of the 2013 Tribeca film festival, the celebration of New York and its movie-making tradition that De Niro co-founded in 2001 when the dust of the fallen Twin Towers had barely settled over Ground Zero. The first festival, in 2002, was framed as a form of economic stimulus, the aim being to attract visitors back to lower Manhattan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\nAnd it succeeded. Each year the festival has expanded, growing international tentacles until it can now claim to have screened more than 1,400 films in 80 countries, including through its Arabic offshoot, Doha-Tribeca. In the process, it has comfortably achieved its initial objective, generating about $750m (\u00a3488m) worth of economic activity for New York.\nBut therein lies a conundrum. New York City is back on its feet, as seen graphically in the form of the looming 1 World Trade Centre, the 1,776ft skyscraper nearing completion in Ground Zero just eight blocks away from De Niro's HQ.\nThe city's revival poses De Niro, together with his co-founder and producer of the Tribeca film festival Jane Rosenthal, with a fundamental question: in its 12th year, what is the festival's purpose now that its initial reason for being has been met and superseded?\nDe Niro says it remains his ambition to make the festival \"part of the tradition of New York, part of the fabric; that I hope will be what it will be in years to come, and it's partially that now.\" His love of the city, and of its cinematic history, remains undiminished: \"It's given me everything. I was born and raised in New York, I studied acting here; I love to travel, but I'm a New Yorker.\"\nHe might have added that the city also gave him his champion, fellow New Yorker Scorsese, who conjured many of De Niro's greatest performances in Mean Streets (1973),"}

A few years ago, she opened her beautiful waterfront home for the now defunct Tiburon-Belvedere Kitchen Tour.\nShe wanted to entertain easily by being able to serve lunch to her children or drinks and appetizers to friends while they enjoyed the sun on her deck.\nSo, she tweaked a retro design idea of creating a pass-through from the kitchen to an adjacent counter on the exterior wall.\nHer inspired idea was to make the pass-through open completely with a folding glass wall, manufactured by Corte Madera\u2019s NanaWall Systems.\nThis deceptively simple tweak made all the difference in her kitchen. Paired with the floor-to-ceiling folding glass walls for which NanaWall is famous, the whole side of the room was able to open up to the watery view.\nNow, NanaWall Systems is marketing the idea to other homeowners who want that full indoor/outdoor experience in their kitchen.\n\u201cIt was always a configuration in our minds, not a package,\u201d explains Matt Thomas of NanaWall Systems. That is until one of their marketing people suggested it, and now it\u2019s an idea the company is showcasing at trade shows.\nCalled the NanaWall Kitchen Transition, the package pairs a short folding glass wall (replacing a traditional window over a kitchen countertop) and floor-to-ceiling folding glass walls (replacing either a traditional sliding door or an entire wall).\nThe window and wall portions of the Kitchen Transition open and operate independently; any combination can be created for virtually any kitchen that faces a backyard, courtyard or deck, creating opening possibilities up to 36 feet in length.\nThe package is available in more than 10 wood options and more than 200 powder-coated color aluminum options. They also come in variable energy-efficient ratings.\nAccording to Thomas, prices for the custom package also vary but range between $600 and $1,000 a linear foot.\nFor more information, call 383-3148 or go to www.nanawall.com.\nPeta Sanderson, a fine artist from San Rafael, tweaked her work and made it movable, too.\nThe muralist has been painting her large-scale works onto folding screens, engineered for safe assembly and disassembly by her husband and business partner, Frederick Reed.\nThe two have formed Cyntheus Fine Art Screens. The screens are her solution \u201cto the challenge of finding novel ways to display fine art and offer flexible options for interior spaces,\u201d she says.\nSo far, the studio has created \u201cPoppy Field\u201d and \u201cAerie.\u201d Each screen is constructed of three panels, 6 feet tall by 2 feet wide.

That's the luxury Arizona has in Finnish freshman Lauri Markkanen.\nMarkkanen is one of the most skilled 7-footers to come through college basketball in a long time. In addition to draining threes, he can put the ball on the floor and occasionally score from the post as well.\nMarkkanen doesn't take a lot of shots, but he makes the most of his opportunities. He averages 15.8 points per game and has the best offensive rating (129.8) in the country among players who use at least 20 percent of their team's possessions, per KenPom.com.\nSindarius Thornwell has been the key piece in Frank Martin's rebuild at South Carolina, and Thornwell is the epitome of a Martin player. Hard-nosed. Tough. Doesn't back down from anyone.\nThornwell has always been able to get buckets, but he's way more efficient this season. He upped his three-point accuracy from 33.3 percent to 39.1 percent and his free throws from 76.4 percent to 83.2 percent.\nThe Gamecocks struggle to score at times, but Thornwell can at least keep them in games almost all by himself. He put up 34 points at Kentucky this season and 44 points in a four-overtime loss to Alabama. He's averaging 21.0 points and 7.2 rebounds on the season.\nEthan Happ is the most unique star player in the country.

Testing AV products is a difficult process with different testers using different criteria on different malware samples; and the same AV product can appear to perform very differently under separate tests. AMTSO was established to provide a level playing field for the vendors by establishing credible and accepted testing standards.\nThe organization has been very quiet over recent months, with hints and rumors of big changes within. These may be needed. For example, a long-standing criticism is that AMTSO is effectively a closed club of and for the AV industry. While it says itself that \u201cmembership is open to academics, reviewers, publications, testers and vendors, subject to guidelines determined by AMTSO,\u201d the actual members page on its website lists just one educational establishment, three test laboratories, two magazine testers, and 20 vendors. Furthermore, an annual membership fee set at \u20ac1250 is not conducive to the inclusion of individual and independent experts.\nPerhaps that change has started. AMTSO has announced a new service on its website: \u201ca feature check solution for users of endpoint anti-malware security products.\u201d Its purpose is to allow users to check the configuration of their installed AV product. For example, with just a few clicks Infosecurity confirmed that one free AV implementation is configured to check against malicious downloads, but is either unable or not configured to prevent phishing attacks.\nIf Corrons is right, then we can expect to see further developments from AMTSO in the future \u2013 perhaps with a greater emphasis on allowing users to test their own products."}

He says that the benefits of TM are centeredness, calmness and creativity.\nOther people have been catching on because of Dalio. The moderator for the evening CNBC anchor/ New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin said that Dalio is the reason he started practicing TM.\n\"Ray runs the largest hedge fund in the world. Lives a pretty stressful life I would think with the markets,\" Sorkin said, adding, \"Most people I know on Wall Street are a bit neurotic.\"\nMost practitioners of TM do it for twenty minutes, twice a day.\n\"You don't do it in truth twenty minutes a day, twice a day, everyday,\" Sorkin said to Dalio.\n\"No, I do it probably two-thirds of the days, twice a day,\" Dalio said, adding, \"It's like yoga.

In other words, when it comes at you, it seems like slow motion. OK, it is what it is. Because there's a calmness. So when there's a calmness, I can deal with it in a better way. Whereas, when there's that anxiety, it all seems so fast and less I am in control.\"\nIn addition to creating calmness, meditation sessions help with generating new ideas, Dalio explained.\n\"It's like when you take a hot shower and you get that creative idea and you just grab it. That's what it's like. Meditation brings you that kind of thing,\" he said.\nHe says you can't muscle it or wrestle with it. You have to allow yourself to go \"into the void.\" It he says this gives you relaxation and creates access to these new ideas.\nAt Bridgewater Associates, Transcendental Meditation has become part of the culture with many of the fund's employees practicing it now. For his staff, Dalio offers to pay half of the cost associated with learning Transcendental Meditation from an instructor.\nHe says meditation has been integral to the fund's success. Because meditation helps produce calmness, the employees are able to have thoughtful disagreements without emotion.\n\""}

Eliot Spitzer is quite likely to go away with him.\nState legislators need to make sure that it does.\nThe proposal is commonly referred to as the Reproductive Health & Privacy Protection Act (RHAPP). It was introduced as a governor\u2019s program bill before Spitzer\u2019s resigned, but remains in the Senate, where it has sat in the health committee since Jan. 9. If committee members decide not to move it, it\u2019ll die there at the end of the session.\nDeath would be appropriate for this terrible bill. Sen. Joseph Griffo, R-Rome, who opposes it, says Spitzer\u2019s reasoning behind the measure was to further strengthen New York\u2019s abortion laws in the wake of last year\u2019s United States Supreme Court decision to uphold the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Such a measure would be significant if Roe v. Wade ever was overturned, and abortion law was left to the states.\nRHAPP is a horrendous bill. It states that abortions may be performed by \u201ca qualified, licensed health care practitioner,\u201d but is not clear whether those abortion providers need to be physicians, what type of training is necessary or what kind of license they need. \u201cQualified licensed health care practitioner,\u201d defined by Public Health Law, could include anybody from chiropractors and dentists to nurses and occupational therapists.\nThe bill also would remove New York\u2019s abortion-related laws from the criminal code and place them in the public-health law. That would rule out any possibility of criminal prosecution for botched jobs, and essentially make abortion immune from state regulation. Among other things, that means parental notification could not be required before performing abortions on minors.\nFurthermore, the New York State Catholic Conference (NYSCC) fears that the act might be used to require health insurance to cover abortions, force doctors to perform abortions, and even compel hospitals, including Roman Catholic facilities, to permit abortions.\nThis bill needs to die in committee, and it\u2019s the responsibility of lawmakers to see that it does. More important, perhaps is our own responsibility to keep our daughters from ever facing this \u201cchoice\u201d in the first place. That means teaching them to appreciate the sanctity of human life.\nOur belief that every life is sacred must be relayed to the next generation through our words and our deeds. And we cannot possibly hope to convey that message by condoning abortion. When we talk to our children about abortion, we must be clear: There are right choices and wrong choices. Abortion is the wrong choice."}

The longtime host of the ABC celebrity ballroom competition tweeted a sentiment about the possible revival of the long-gone results show.\nBergeron shared an article written by TV historian Marc Berman about network scheduling suggestions for the 2019-20 TV season in which it was proposed that ABC should revive the Tuesday night DWTS results show in a half-hour format, Gold Derby reports. In the article, it was suggested that Dancing with the Stars air in its normal Monday night time slot as well as Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. as a lead-in for the struggling 10 p.m. hour.\nBergeron retweeted Berman\u2019s article and then wrote that he wanted to \u201csecond\u201d Mr. TV \u2018s thoughts about the two-night return of Dancing with the Stars.\nDancing with the Stars scrapped its two-night format more than five years ago. The downsizing of the show and loss of the results show has made for some controversial changes in the voting format as performance scores are now added to the viewer votes from the previous week, meaning a star could be sent home even if they gave a perfect performance because votes were based on a previous dance. Many longtime DWTS fans questioned last season\u2019s winner, Bobby Bones, whose surprising win wasn\u2019t completely based on his finale night dances due to the nonsensical voting structure.\nWhen Dancing with the Stars changed to a one-night format back in 2013, The New York Post noted that the two-night extravaganza had become too expensive to produce.\nBut fans have missed the real-time results show, where a combination of that week\u2019s votes and the judges\u2019 scores determined who would go home.\nWhile ABC did not air a spring cycle of Dancing with the Stars this year for the first time since 2006, the show will return in September.\nABC has not announced the format for the upcoming 28th season of Dancing with the Stars, but during last month\u2019s Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke announced that the reality dance competition series would definitely be returning for Season 28 this fall.

{"idx": "22687", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Plop. Census forms are about to land on the mats of the 25 million households in the UK.\nI yield to no one in my hostility to this type of state intrusion - although it probably is necessary for the Government to attempt to have some idea of how many people live on these islands and roughly where the population is spread. That is the basis for how different public services across the country are funded.\nSo this year the Census has come round again. There is certainly nothing new about the idea.\nIn terms of getting the fair share for your local community of services like policing, health and road improvements it is important for people not to be missed off. If a locality has more people living in it then is officially recognised it means it will get a lower share of spending than it is entitled to.\nIt means for instance that local councils get lower central Government grants than otherwise - perhaps with them charging you a higher council tax to make up the difference.\nBut even if the practical requirement for some estimate of the population is conceded that doesn't mean this is the right way of going about it.\nThere are 56 questions which is too many. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has lobbied for one on sexual orientation which has thankfully been resisted.\nBut we will all be asked to fill in our ethnic group. What business is that of the Government? Why do they need to know if we have a spare bedroom or not? Why do they need to know if our central heating is gas or electric? Or if the house is terraced, detached or semi detached? Or where we were living a year ago? How dare they ask to know our religious beliefs?\nThere is such detailed snooping as the date of birth of someone who happens to be staying overnight on March 27 - the date the census applies to.\nThe objection to all these superfluous questions is not just on libertarian grounds.\nThe longer they make the form the fewer the number of people who will fill it in. Only 94 per cent of households filled in the last one in 2001 - despite it being a legal requirement backed up with the threat of fines.\nWith non compliance on that scale the threat rings pretty hollow. The courts just couldn't cope with millions of extra cases. Higher immigration makes the accuracy of this year's census even more dubious. \u00a3482 million is a lot of money to spend if you end up with a great fat pile of dodgy data.\nThere are reports that this could be the last census. The Government is looking at alternatives. The trouble is these sound even worse.\nOne proposal is to use information on store cards. But that would be even more intrusive - the Government sneaking behind our backs for information about us rather than asking us directly. It also is hard to see how it could be remotely comprehensive.\nWhat about those of us who don't have supermarket loyalty cards? We will not be counted. What about those of who (rather stretching the concept) have loyalty cards with two rival supermarkets? Perhaps one might be registered at an old address. Would such people be counted twice?\nHistorians would be sorry too see the census go. They find it valuable to look at how Britain has changed.\nSo the census should stay but in 2021 they should offer a streamlined version.\nIf the Government asked fewer questions they might get answers from more of us."}

How will the city replace him?\nHow to find a chief to run the city\u2019s embattled police department\u2014and how a new hire could make all the difference.\nPhoto illustration by James Emmerman. Photos by Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty and Scott Olson/Getty Images.\nThursday was Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson\u2019s last day on the job. Jackson, who had been chief for about five years, announced his resignation earlier this month, in the wake of a report by the Department of Justice that found a culture of extreme police abuse and systematic racial discrimination taking place on his watch. He will be replaced, on an interim basis, by Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Eickhoff, who joined the Ferguson Police Department as assistant chief about a week before the killing of Michael Brown, will be able to regain the trust of the city\u2019s residents during his temporary run at the top of the organization. That work will probably fall instead to whomever the city hires to permanently replace Jackson\u2014an undertaking that, according to a city spokesperson, will be outsourced to an executive headhunting firm that will conduct a nationwide search for candidates.\nWe don\u2019t yet know which firm the city of Ferguson will be working with, or what the timeline for the search will be. But with Jackson now out of office, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the critical importance of who will succeed him, and how that person will be chosen.\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter who is in charge of this disgraced agency, if the officers who carried out its oppressive policies all still work there? The answer is yes.\n\u201cIf you have a strong chief, it just counts for so much,\u201d said Jim Chanin, a civil rights lawyer in California who was instrumental in pushing the city of Oakland to reform its police force after more than a decade of rampant brutality. Chanin\u2019s experience has made him strongly inclined to be skeptical when law enforcement promises change: For almost a decade, starting in 2003, he watched as a consent decree imposed on Oakland law enforcement, which required the city to introduce a series of policy changes, was disregarded not only by rank-and-file officers but by their superiors as well. Then, in October 2012, Chanin managed to compel the department to start taking the consent decree seriously. (Basically, he filed a lawsuit that would have put the department under federal control; you can read the whole story of his battle with the city at Politico Magazine.) This resulted in the hiring of a new chief named Sean Whent in 2014. And that, it turned out, made all the difference: According to data cited in Politico, complaints against the police have dropped at least 40 percent over the past year. And while the years 2000 to 2012 saw an average of eight police-involved shootings per year, there were zero in 2014.\nSo how will Ferguson find candidates who are capable of inspiring that kind of change? I put that question to two recruiters who specialize in law enforcement, and they described the process for me in broad strokes.\nThe first thing city leaders have to decide is whether they\u2019re going to go outside the department to make the hire\u2014something Ferguson officials haven\u2019t committed to, according to the city spokesperson, even though in places where something traumatic and destabilizing has happened (think Los Angeles after the R"}

Segura accumulated more and more fans with each Netflix comedy special and appearances on popular podcasts like the Joe Rogan Experience. He believes with today's demand for content, the battle is in keeping your audience engaged.\nWhen do you feel your career went to another level?\nFor me, I think it\u2019s been real gradual and I\u2019m actually very thankful for it. The alternative to things getting big for you is immediate and it seems like a way less reliable way and probably more of a shot to your system.\nI\u2019ve felt a bump with each of the specials coming out. It went from when the one came out in 2014 (Completely Normal), I was selling out clubs by the end of that year, then I was doing rock clubs, then another special came out [and] I started to enter theaters.\nThe last special came out, now we\u2019re doing like big theaters and sometimes we\u2019re doing two and three and four shows in big theaters. I\u2019m just glad it took five years to get to that point. If that had happened overnight, I think it might be overwhelming.\nAfter getting introduced to a big audience, how important is it to work to keep their interest?\nAnybody that\u2019s on a bigger platform, it\u2019s good for you to get the exposure, but you have to run with it once you\u2019re shown to the masses. I think the whole content/consumer [relationship] today is just \u2018gimme, gimme, gimme\u2019 all the time. That\u2019s sort of the model now, it\u2019s like, Put out content all the time.\nIt\u2019s up to you how you want to do it. I basically do it through the podcast (Your Mom's House co-hosted by wife Christina Pazsitzky). We put a few hours of content out each week, we put out content on social media and then obviously with the touring and stuff, but you can\u2019t just rely on doing an appearance on a big show every once in a while, you still gotta run with it.\nIs keeping up with that demand exhausting?\nI kind of just think of it as what I do. I think it\u2019s exhausting, probably, to just do one of those things all the time. Sometimes you do a tour on the road and you do like eight or nine shows on the road and the idea of flying back to LA and doing another show, I\u2019m like, No way, dude. I\u2019m all burned out of stand up this week because I just did nine hours of it.\nBut at the same time, I\u2019ll miss doing a podcast because I haven\u2019t done it in a while. So I think the back and forth of it is what keeps it interesting and doesn\u2019t exhaust you.\nDo you remember the first time you met Rogan?\nI actually met him because I won a contest, for real. I won a contest in, I want to say 2007 and the grand prize was that you got to open a show that he was on with Charlie Murphy, they were doing a tour. Charlie Murphy and John Heffron were doing a tour.\nIt was called the Bud Light Maxim Real Men of Comedy tour, I\u2019m not making that up.

{"idx": "22702", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Vancouver residents have spent the last two years desperately grasping for a solid explanation of the forces driving property prices so high, so fast.\nThere was hope answers would come with the publication of a major report on empty homes the city released this morning (March 8).\nThey did not. The report is now out and there are just as many questions about real-estate prices as there were yesterday.\nIn January 2016, the benchmark price of a single-family detached home on Vancouver\u2019s east side was $1.23 million, according to the Real Estate Board of Metro Vancouver. Homes on the city\u2019s west side rose to a benchmark price of $2.93 million. A popular theory on why property values have increased so dramatically suggests foreign nationals are parking cash in Vancouver homes and then leaving them empty, thus distorting the real-estate market by separating it from local wealth and wages.\nThe study the city released today does not prove foreign money is having no effect on Vancouver property prices. However, by failing to find evidence of that where some assumed it would, the data does suggest the possible role of foreign money in Vancouver real-estate could likely be smaller than many have come to assume.\nIn 2014, the vacancy rate for the City of Vancouver was 4.8, almost exactly what it was 12 years earlier, when the rate was 4.9 percent in 2002. That\u2019s below the national average of seven percent.\nThe vast majority of Vancouver\u2019s empty dwellings are apartments, the study found.\nSingle-family and duplex homes have a vacancy rate of just one percent, a number that has remained stable for the 12-year period covered by the study.\nWhile the data fails to offer answers related to the affordability of single-family detached homes, it suggests there might be more government can do with condos and apartments to provide some relief to the housing market.\nThe vacancy rate for Vancouver apartments is 7.2 percent, the study found. That number, while still in line with the national average, represents an estimated 9,750 empty units.\nThe study utilized 12 years\u2019 of anonymized BC Hydro data to determine volatilities in power consumption that can serve as evidence of empty homes. It focused on long-term vacancies, using a definition that aimed to exclude dwellings that might be left empty for a few months but that still had a valid reason to be considered occupied. For example, it would count a house owned by snowbirds who escape to Arizona for December and January as inhabited.\nResults of the study were presented to council by Matthew Bourke of the city\u2019s housing policy and projects department and Bruce Townson, a consultant and CEO of Ecotagious Inc.\nTownson called attention to the issue of empty condos.\nHe noted the study\u2019s definition of apartments consists of two subsets: purpose-built rental apartments and privately-owned condos.\nThat said, he continued, empty homes in neighbourhoods the study calls Northwest Vancouver and Southwest Vancouver do exist. Those areas together comprise the city\u2019s west side, where property values have climbed the fastest in recent years. They have vacancy rates of 7.4 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, according to the study.\nMeanwhile, Vancouver\u2019s downtown core has a vacancy rate of six percent.\nBourke attempted to explain what the city should take from the report.\nWhile Vancouver condo prices have not increased anywhere near as fast as the value of single-family detached homes, they have still outpaced inflation and growth in wages.\nAccording to data collected by"}

It took down thousands of computers in Ukraine and spread around the world, disrupting shipping and businesses.\nSecurity researchers and cyber experts believe the NotPetya and BadRabbit attacks could have been carried out by the same group as they share a key piece of code.\nDemedyuk said Ukrainian authorities had prevented five other major attacks on financial institutions and strategic infrastructure since June, declining to name the targets.\nIn one of the attacks, police managed to block the transfer of 10 million hryvnia ($371,277) out of a company\u2019s account.\nHe also said hackers have been exploiting so-called \u201cback doors\u201d that were installed by hackers during the NotPetya attack."}
{"idx": "22704", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Since the sell-off in January and mid-February, the U.S. stock market has been experiencing a relief rally as investors hope for more stimulus from global central banks. On February 10th, I tweeted that central banks may create a \"bogus, temporary rally off key support levels like SP500's 1,800.\" So far, this is exactly what has happened. I've been skeptical of this rebound because none of the bearish market drivers in January have been fixed: Deutsche Bank and UBS' stock and bond carnage, the deflating tech/biotech bubble, coming energy sector defaults, junk bond pain, and much more.\nThough I've been skeptical of the market rebound and suspect that it's a dead cat bounce (a result of dead cat bounces in commodities, emerging markets, tech stocks, etc.), I still wait for technical confirmation to make sure I'm following the predominant trend instead of fighting it. Markets often move in a counter-intuitive manner because it's difficult to know how much bad or good news is already priced in and because informed participants may be acting on information that has not become widespread yet.\nThe large cap SP500 is still forming a trading range with a support at approximately 1,800 (the October 2014 ebola panic lows) and a resistance at 2,125 (the spring and summer 2015 highs). The SP500's recent rebound occurred right off of the 1,800 level. It will likely require a stimulus announcement from the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan in order for the SP500 to reach the top of its trading range near 2,125. At the same time, never say never - anything can happen in these centrally planned markets.\nA convincing break below the SP500's 1,800 support level would give a worrisome bearish confirmation, while a strong close above the 2,125 resistance level is necessary to confirm another leg of the bull market. Much of the market action that occurs within this trading range is noise, not signal - keep that in mind.\nThe monthly SP500 chart shows that there still isn't any technical damage because the index is above its uptrend line that started seven years ago. The time to really worry is if the SP500 closes below its 1,800 horizontal support level and the longer-term uptrend line.\nThe Dow Industrials are also trading in a range with a support zone from 15,500 to 16,000 and a resistance at 18,250. A convincing close under the support zone is necessary to give a bearish confirmation.\nLike the SP500, the Dow's monthly chart isn't showing technical damage yet because the long-term uptrend line is still intact.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is also trading in a range with a sloping support line and a resistance level at 5,200. A decisive break below this support level would give another bearish signal.\nThe Nasdaq's longer-term trend is still up as long as the index remains above the uptrend line that started in March 2009.\nOf all the U.S. stock indices, the small cap Russell 2000 is showing the most damage on the weekly chart.

Malawi Police has extended bail for the arrested top officials of the Malawi Congress Party namely Dr Jessie Kabwira, Peter Chankhwatha who are both Member of Parliaments (MPs) and shadow MP Ulemu Msungama. The three were politically by the Peter Mutharika administration and were charged with treason and sedition charges.\nThis is the third time the Malawi police has extended the bail application which some quarters of the society has questioned the legality of the case whether the state has enough evidence to take the trio to court.\nAccording to the police bail sheet the three MCP officials are said to be plotting to topple President Peter Mutharika through a WhatsApp conversation on ways to curtail the move.\nwho sanctioned the arrest the move which has cornered the police on how to proceed with the case.\nAfter the arrest of the three, Inspector General of Police (IG) Lexen Kachama through the press conference confessed to the public that the police did not have proper charges for them saying their arrest was a mere warning to what were discussing on WhatsApp.\nAddressing journalists soon after the trio appeared at Area 30, Police Headquarters in the capital Lilongwe on Friday, morning, per bail condition, Gustav Kaliwo, the trio\u2019s lawyer who is also MCP Secretary General expressed worrisome over the police delay to charge his clients properly arguing that the move aimed at harassing and intimating the party through unfound accusation to suffocate the party\u2019s role of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership.\nKaliwo hinted that the party will not get tied with the delaying tactics authority was playing on his clients saying the battle rages on until the truth was known.\n\u201cAs you remember that their bails were extended to this day April 29, 2016, so, we came expecting that we would be told when this matter is going to be prosecuted in court. Sadly again, their bails have been extended up to May 31, 2016. No genuine reasons have been given for the third extension of bail apart from saying investigation on the same is still underway. So will wait the police to tell us the date when my clients will be taken to court to prove the alleged treason and sedition charges.\n\u201cOnce again, this is very disappointing development regarding to how the matter is being handled because you can\u2019t expect the police just arrest someone without proper evidence against them. My clients are very ready to battle with the authority in court even now. Currently, we are still monitoring the situation closely as the move is just there to harass and intimidate us as a party\u201d, worried Kaliwo.\nThe Maravi Post later caught up with Kabwira, a legislator for Salima North West Constituency, who challenged the authority to produce the evidence against them on the alleged treason saying the motive was to suffocate the insightful role as opposition party on the mess DPP government has inflicted on Malawians.\nKabwira said the extension of the bail will not stop her as MCP Spokesperson on pointing out issues affecting Malawians including food, drug shortages in public hospitals, skyrocketing of goods and services.\n\u201cThis extension is a joke as its for third time. The time we are spending visiting the police we could have been in constituencies carrying developmental activities. In fact, am almost ready to be in court to challenge the state as I have enough evidence that we didn\u2019t plan take over government.\n\u201cThis just show that the state don\u2019t have enough evidence to carry on the case to the court."}

Los Angeles and other nearby cities outside of West Hollywood have not finalized their local permitting rules so licenses to businesses in those jurisdictions are yet to be granted.\nMedMen is the best-known cannabis retailer in the United States.\nYet, in what could be a warning for the American marijuana industry, it is racing to raise cash to cover its mounting losses.\nFinancial statements released in February showed that MedMen risked running out of money within months unless it raised more money. Last week, MedMen alleviated any immediate financial crisis by securing a $100 million credit line from a cannabis-focused investment company. The loan may ultimately be raised to $250 million if MedMen's performance improves.\nThe terms of the financing are onerous \u2014 MedMen must repay it at 6 percent over Libor and issue warrants \u2014 but the fresh cash will buy the company time. Its shares, which had fallen almost 60 percent since October, have risen slightly since the announcement. At its current share prices, MedMen is worth about $1.6 billion, down from a high of roughly $3 billion last year.\nStill, MedMen's struggles show the challenge that cannabis companies face in operating in states where high taxes and dispensary restrictions have driven up prices for legal marijuana. In California, MedMen's core market, highly regulated legal companies are struggling to compete for customers with illicit dealers who charge far less.\nIn fact, legalized dispensaries and regulators have begun to call for greater enforcement against the illegal market in California, raising the potential that legalization may actually lead to a new wave of cannabis-related arrests. Meanwhile, MedMen has had limited success in its efforts to attract new or infrequent users, raising questions about how big that market may be.\nWith 16 stores at the end of 2018, California-based MedMen has aggressively tried to market cannabis to new users. Some dispensaries \u2014 the industry's term for stores \u2014 compete for existing marijuana users on price or product strength. But MedMen aims to become a national retail chain and brands itself as offering an upscale experience with stylish stores.\nTo that end, the company recently released a two-minute ad called \"The New Normal\" \u2014 which conjures up the acronym for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws \u2014 to extoll legalized cannabis. The ad, from the director Adam Spiegel \u2014 aka Spike Jonze \u2014 ends with a suburban couple carrying a distinctive red MedMen bag home. \"The symbol of counterculture is now just culture,\" the ad concludes. \"It's normal again.\"\nBut behind the gloss, MedMen's finances are dismal.\nDuring the last six months of 2018, MedMen lost $131 million \u2014 more than $2 for every dollar in marijuana it sold.

He has better things to do on a Sunday afternoon - and that's probably the only time he might even contemplate gardening.\nOnly dire necessity impinges on our friend's disinterest, and about once every 12 months he makes sudden and radical war with clippers and spade. It's heroic stuff: giant clumps of perennial this-and-that get heaved into new corners. Other accumulations are generally hacked and chopped. This is a pioneer's pruning and taming of rarely explored territory. Afterward, he is proud to show what he has done. And it is an achievement of sorts - a temporary victory of brute force over habitual reluctance. Then h e happily settles back into habitual reluctance, no fonder of gardens than he ever was.\nWe have immediate neighbors who are not gardeners either, but they are not gardeners in a different way. Their form of not-gardening is of the \"friend of the Earth\" variety: In other words, if the earth that happens to be around their house walls chooses to sport a flurry of dandelions, a hoard of nettles, or a groundswell of groundsel - things that a regular gardener would look upon with withering disfavor - then that's OK by them. It's all nature, after all.\nThe effect is not precisely what some garden professionals are now advocating as the \"wild look\" - that look has to be carefully contrived. This lovingly neglected garden doesn't just look wild, it is wild. Thoroughly so. And although the wifely half of this friendly couple can occasionally be discovered prying out of the driveway five or six of the dandelions that she feels have finally gone a little over the top in their profligate ambition to carpet the universe, on the whole she likes things the way they are, and is much happier studying ancient Icelandic literature in her library.\nThese neighbors have a neighbor who is a gardening enthusiast. They are perfectly forgiving about his freakish behavior - it's a free world, each to his tastes, is their attitude. If their neighbor is peculiar enough to weed and mow, manure and plant, then who are they to judge? Not that they actually notice. They walk past the results of all this garden buff-ery without a glance.\nThis gardening neighbor of theirs - whom I happen to know quite well - tells me he doesn't mind. After all he is not gardening for them. On the other hand, he does find it hard to understand how anyone can be indifferent to something from which he derives such compelling, gigantic joy.\nAre gardeners born? He can't remember when he didn't love plants and their cooperative gathering in communities called gardens. But he does remember some of the occasions that intensified this affection.\nOne of the earliest, at his home in the north of England, was the triangular summer garden his mother planted for him at the foot of the narrow path descending steeply from the steps down from the back yard. She had contrived to gather into this one small, overlooked corner every kind of annual flower that might appeal to a child. \"I only remember it,\" he says now, \"at the absolute peak of its flowering - a miniature wonder-world packed to its gills with flowers.\"\n\"I remember,\" he goes on,"}

Critics praised the show for humanising women prisoners \u2013 especially inmates of colour and those with mental health issues - and for showcasing diverse sexualities and bodies.\nWell over 90 per cent of reviews for the first four seasons were positive, according to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The show also propelled the career of Laverne Cox, helping her to become the first transgender actor nominated for an Emmy.\nHowever, reviews for the fifth and sixth seasons were mixed. Some critics argued the show was beginning to lose direction. Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall said while season five was action-packed, it was a \"chore\" to get through. Season six, he wrote, \"feels stuck between a reboot and a reset\".\nTime's Judy Berman, meanwhile, wrote that the plot \"sags a bit midway through the season, largely because Orange devotes too much time to one-note characters\". But she did praise the show's deep-dive into the \"darkest panorama\" of the American justice system.\nNews of the show's ending came in the form of a video message from some of the show's key cast members, who praised everyone involved for creating one of the \"most groundbreaking, original and controversial\" TV shows of the decade.\nActress Taylor Schilling, who plays the unlikeable protagonist Piper Chapman, told The Hollywood Reporter it was going to be hard to say goodbye to a show she had worked on for six years.\n\"It's very poignant,\" she said. \"It's a very kind of surreal time.

In an interview with South Africa's Mail and Guardian Newspaper, Clegg states that the song is open criticism of Mugabe's government. In the interview, Clegg adds that while culture should never be used as a weapon because that would reduce cultural value, musicians and other performers have a duty to draw attention to injustice.\nIn addition, Clegg says \"The Revolution Will Eat its Children\" is about the \"inability of certain African leaders to relinquish power, despite its being time to do so.\"\nAlso, the new CD reveals that Clegg is distancing himself from South Africa's \"quiet diplomacy\" -- a method identified with Zimbabwe in it's political dealings with the country.\nAnother track with a sobering message is one called \"Boy Soldier\" which is a song about the plight of child soldiers.\nClegg was born in England in 1953 and raised in Zimbabwe before immigrating to South Africa at age nine. He originally made a name for himself as a member of the group \"Juluka\", alongside Sipho Mchunu.\nThe duo sang songs denouncing the Apartheid regime and, as a result, ended up being banned by the country's state broadcaster.

Pakistani Islamic terrorists are most often noticed when they kill people or blow something up. Most of this mayhem is caused by the Taliban, an organization formed by the Pakistani military in the early 1990s inside the Pakistani tribal territories. The membership was almost entirely Afghan Pushtuns living in refugee camps. After 2001 a Pakistani branch of the Taliban (staffed by Pakistani Pushtuns) was formed. Largely unnoticed (outside of Pakistan) is the fact that the Pushtuns have also been responsible for a lot more of the non-Islamic criminal activity inside Pakistan as well as most of the Islamic terrorism..\nWhat is remarkable about this is that the Pushtun tribes comprise only 15 percent of the Pakistani population and are also the poorest and least educated minority. A unique feature of Pakistan is that it's 165 million people are all minorities, although the Punjabis (44 percent of the population) are the dominant one (not just in numbers, but in education and income as well). Closely allied with the Punjabis are the Sindis (14 percent), and together these two groups pretty much run the country. Karachi, the largest city in Pakistani, is in Sind, but contains residents from all over the country. Then there are Seraikis (10.5 percent, related to Punjabis), Muhajirs (7.6 percent, Moslems who came from India after 1947), Baluchis (3.6 percent) and other minorities amounting to about five percent. The Seraikis and Muhajirs live in Punjab and Sind.\nSince September 11, 2001 there have been a lot more Pushtun fleeing to Pakistan's largest city, Karachi. This metropolis contains eight percent of the nation's population (14 million people) and produces a quarter of the GDP. Islamic radicals have long been present in the city. The Taliban have established a presence among the two million Pushtuns there. But a lot of the criminal gangs in Karachi are Pushtun and these are the gangs the Taliban often work closely with. Moreover there are now more murders in Karachi than in the tribal territories and this has been a trend since 2010. Finally, in 2013, the number of terrorist deaths in the northwestern tribal territories fell below 2,000 and the murders in Karachi rose above 2,000. Pakistani security forces are acutely aware of who is doing most of the mayhem.\nA lot of the violence in Karachi is the result of the Taliban trying to prevent the police from stopping the Pushtun radicals establishing save havens in Karachi. The Taliban are succeeding at this, and many Islamic terrorist attacks in non-tribal Pakistan (where over 90 percent of the population is) are coming out of Karachi Pushtun neighborhoods. The Pushtun gangsters cooperate with the Taliban to keep the police out of Pushtun neighborhoods.\nCurrently some 20 percent of Karachi neighborhoods are controlled (to one degree or another) by Pushtun gangsters or Islamic terrorists.

Initial market responses were negative as this is a Black Swan risk for events on the Korean peninsula. From our point of view, the important focus points are: 1) North Korea's reaction to Kim's death; 2) South Korea's response; and 3) the positions taken by the US and China, along with other important neighbours such as Japan and Russia.\nRegarding the North Korean reaction, we believe that the military response is likely to be similar to that which followed the 1994 passing of his father Kim Il Sung - that is, highlighting their sadness to strengthen the regime. South Korea most probably has contingency plans that include economic policy measures to military and diplomatic actions. The top priority in economic terms would be to limit market volatility and enhance market confidence.

The key is to focus on the edge that you can keep for the longer term. In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp are joined by former Fool Morgan Housel to talk about figuring out what your sustainable advantages are, both in investing and in life. He lays out five possible advantages that you and the businesses you invest in might already have, or want to cultivate, in service of acquiring an edge. The second: making an effort to see yourself in customers' shoes.\nAlison Southwick: No. 2 is the ability to empathize with customers more than your competition.\nMorgan Housel: Yes, this is something that I've seen a lot. I think this is especially true as the economy bifurcates with income inequality. You have CEOs and managers, or entire companies, that can't empathize with their customers because they are so far removed from the product or the experience that their company is targeting for those customers.\nI give [this] example in the article. How many times do you think the CEO of Delta Airlines or United Airlines -- I won't pick on anyone -- has been booted from a flight or had their bags lost?\nSouthwick: Or even flown coach.\nHousel: Or even flown coach and had their knees shoved up into their chest because they're 6'3\" sitting in coach. Probably never. It's hard to truly empathize with the experience that your customers are going through when you are so far removed from that.\nThe other example I give is how often the CEO of McDonald's goes to McDonald's because that's truly what he wants to eat that day, and not because, \"Oh, I'm the CEO. I need to go try the product and make an appearance.\" But truly they're driving down the street, they're hungry, and they say, \"I need to go to McDonald's.\" If you can't fully empathize or just put yourself in your customers' shoes, to that extent there's always going to be a disconnect between the product that you think you're delivering and the actual experience that your customers are experiencing.\nRobert Brokamp: In a previous episode we talked about the rise of artificial intelligence. And one of the points was along the lines of what you said earlier. That intelligence is essentially going to be a commodity at some point. Computers are ultimately smarter than we are. To the extent we all want to keep our jobs, we have to focus on things that computers can't do and one of them is empathy. Exactly."}

{"idx": "22731", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Since Florida&apos;s frontier days when cattlemen drove their herds through the state&apos;s vast fields and forests, ranchers and native panthers have been natural enemies.\nThe ranchers seek to nurture and protect their calves, while the panthers see them as prey.\nHuman development won the battle, driving the large, tawny cats to the brink of extinction before successful efforts to restore them began decades ago.\nBut with Florida&apos;s panther population recovering, some ranchers complain the protected 6-to-7-foot long predators are once again killing their calves.\nNow, university research supports that claim, at least in one part of southwest Florida.\nA University of Florida researcher hired by federal wildlife officials has found that panthers are killing calves in an area where the predatory felines are thriving. Her study, the first to quantify the kills and losses, was given to The Associated Press exclusively.\nThe research marks the first step toward the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considering a program that would pay ranchers for preserving acres of panther habitat, instead of undertaking the impossible task of verifying every kill.\n\"Ranchers will tell you that they suspected panthers were killing their calves, although no one knows how many they&apos;re losing,\" said Caitlin Jacobs, the university researcher who staked out a ranch for the better part of two years. \"It&apos;s hard to find the calves \u2014 when panthers kill they drag the prey into the forest and cover it with brush to hide them from scavengers.\"\nIt&apos;s estimated that at one time, more than 1,300 panthers roamed Florida before their numbers dwindled \u2014 at one point in the 1800s, the state&apos;s government offered $5 for panther scalps. There were as few as 20 panthers in the 1990s, but the population has rebounded thanks to conservation efforts.\nThe problem began to draw the attention of state and federal wildlife officials about four years ago, after third-generation Florida rancher Liesa Priddy, owner of the 9,300-acre JB Ranch near Immokalee, became suspicious when a new calf vanished.\n\"My first calf went missing shortly after being born,\" said Priddy, who is also a member of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \"I couldn&apos;t find remnants of a body or anything else. She just totally disappeared.\"\nRanchers had been telling federal and state wildlife officials about the problem for years, but lacked scientific evidence. Calves are also commonly killed by coyotes, vultures and even bears.\nIn the past, ranchers simply would have shot the panthers, but because the state&apos;s 100 to 180 panthers are legally protected under the Endangered Species Act, they have few options.\nPriddy had a local outdoorsman stake out her pasture with night-vision goggles. That night, a panther took a calf and they found the carcass, Priddy said.\nShe called out a state biologist, who confirmed it was a panther kill and began the research to find out how pervasive the issue had become.\n\"We started to hear more from the ranching community as a whole that this was a problem that we need to address,\" said Kevin Godsea, project leader of the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. \"Since then we&apos;ve done some investigating.

{"idx": "22732", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The artist Julie Roberts laughs. \"I'm like Snow White,\" she jokes. We are sitting in a suburban garden in Carlisle with her dog Shiner, and the former stray cat Black, who she befriended when she was on a scholarship at the British School in Rome (he was Nero back then.) The latest addition to her menagerie is a juvenile blackbird she has nicknamed Chicken which seems to be semi-tame and is bathing in a dish of water beside us as we talk.\nThis rather extraordinary scene is not Roberts' home but her studio.\nInside, everything is rigorous discipline. In laboratory conditions of cleanliness Roberts is finishing three new works, part of a major exhibition at the Talbot Rice Gallery in Edinburgh, one of the sure highlights of the Edinburgh Art Festival.\nThat exhibition is called Child. The 46-year-old Roberts' new paintings and drawings - rigorously constructed and highly stylised works reminiscent of children's books or instruction manuals - are drawn from historic archives on subjects that document children under duress, estranged from conventional family life or displaced by circumstances.\nThey include many images drawn from a mid-century world of Barnardo's children's homes, of evacuees and children in foster care. When Roberts talks about these works she does so with particular tenderness. She shows me a work called Human Material, an image of a boy in a bath, from a photograph probably taken to demonstrate that the institutions that cared for children had high standards of hygiene.\n\"There's something very wrong about this painting,\" she says. \"And it's not the way it's painted. It's this little boy in this very austere institutional bathroom, washing his own body and there should be a mum there doing it. It's quite a sad little painting, just him and a little bit of carbolic soap.\"\nThese placid images in mute colours, which often feature domestic details such as flowered wallpaper or textiles, are testaments to hidden lives. They are historic images but clear signals to a modern world that is superficially obsessed with the welfare of children, but which often fails to listen directly to them.\nThe paintings are about the fundamental oddness of these situations - the dormitories, the little people in uniforms, the posed photographs of children at prayer - but also about the paradoxical survival of the children who have been through them. They do not condemn the social care system, they acknowledge its necessity, but they also call on us to look directly at the constrained lives of children adrift within its history.\nThis dynamic is important, because in confronting images of children apart from their families, Roberts' art is also privately addressing the brief spells she and her three siblings spent in foster care and children's homes more than 40 years ago before being reunited with her family in Fflint, North Wales.\nIt's a period of which, because of her youth, Roberts has few clear memories but which it seems she has been gradually creeping towards in her work. She reminds me of the actor Samantha Morton, herself a product of the care system. Like Morton, Roberts has never been defined by her background but has brought a complexity and depth to her work that is in some part drawn from her life experience.\nRoberts maintains close contact - \"bonds of love\" - with her siblings and her long-separated parents, despite the difficulties arising from her father's alcoholism that took her into care. She is able to draw on extraordinary reservoirs of knowledge and emotion when she chooses and she has the artistic bravery that comes from being a bit of an outs"}

{"idx": "22734", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A Census Bureau report this month predicting a significant increase in population and in the percentage of ethnic minorities in the United States made big news, but the bigger news may be how little Americans should be worrying over the trends.\nThe bureau projects that by 2050, the U.S. population will be 44 percent white, 30 percent Hispanic, 13 percent black and 8 percent Asian \u2013 nearly mirroring California\u2019s population, which is 43 percent white, 36 percent Hispanic, 13 percent Asian and 7 percent black. In the past, some conservatives, and even some environmentalists, have used demographic projections to press for tighter border security. But their arguments may well be off the mark.\nBy many accounts, immigration has improved employment and productivity while increasing the flexibility of U.S. labor markets. According to Wall Street Journal writer Jason Riley, most immigrants assimilate quickly because they share American values of freedom, hard work, and democracy. Employment and homeownership \u2013 both good indications of assimilation \u2013 are up among immigrants. The 2000 census also reports that 91 percent of the second-generation and 97 percent of the third-generation immigrants speak English well.\nThe gradual assimilation seen in the Hispanic population similarly occurred with the Germans and Irish in the 19th century and southeastern Europeans and Chinese in the 20th century. Like today\u2019s Hispanic immigrants, most of these immigrants were poor and unskilled. There is an argument that immigration strains social programs, but the root problem isn\u2019t immigration \u2013 it\u2019s the Nanny State social programs themselves.\nThe aging U.S. population actually may constitute a bigger problem than immigration, given that among the white population those over age 65 is expected to double. However, the Hispanic population will remain young and vital, with minorities expected to constitute a majority of 18- to 29-year-olds by 2028. The increase in immigration and birth rate among Hispanics will actually slightly delay the Social Security crisis.\nAll in all, the growing population can be viewed as a boon: It allows America to stay younger than European and Asian countries, which are facing social and economic problems due to declining birth rates and aging populations. That means the U.S. will have a larger labor force and a greater demand for commodities, which will, in turn, promote economic growth. In this view, the Census Bureau forecast foretells a promising future."}

Talk of additional tax cuts and spending may be supporting sentiment,\u201d said ANZ senior economist David Plank.\nThere was also better news on construction as data showed approvals to build new homes jumped 19.1 percent in February, when analysts had looked for a small drop.\nThe pickup came thanks to a 62 percent surge in multi-home approvals, which includes major apartment blocks.

It was never the size that I'm afraid was at one point being claimed and there were those of us on the board that knew that and felt that we made a quite serious tactical error in hopping up down too early for too much,\" Puttnam admitted.\nDuncan began lobbying for some form of subsidy shortly after his arrival at Channel 4 in late 2004, basing his strategy on an appeal to the government for extra cash to plug a predicted shortfall in programme funding as advertising revenues declined.

You're not the chief executive ... [you] try and convince the chief executive he's made a mistake.\"\nPuttnam also admitted that salaries at Channel 4 had got out of control in what he described as \"a moment of madness\".\nDuncan and Channel 4's former director of television Kevin Lygo, who is now managing director of ITV Studios, were both paid more than \u00a31m a year at one point. \"I arrived long after the deals with Kevin Lygo and Andy Duncan,\" Puttnam said.\nHe added that there had been \"extremely robust conversations about salaries\". \"There was a moment of madness.

As we have previously noted, Luntz conducted a focus group a week ago that he repeatedly described, as he did last night, as having \"half McCain voters, half Barack Obama voters,\" without noting that it was not a representative sample of Americans. A representative sample would have comprised 53% Obama voters to 46% for McCain. Instead, the so called \"half McCain voters\" actually included a reverse make up of 54% McCain voters (and 46% for Obama) because Luntz revealed in one of his earlier appearances that the group really consisted of 13 McCain voters to 11 Obama voters. Not asked or answered in any of the segments I've seen about this same focus group (three, so far) is whether or not the Obama voters were actually Democrats, as Luntz suggested, or merely Obama-voting Republicans or independents. Judging from the GOP talking points the group always repeats and the suspicious paucity of Democratic viewpoints and people of color, I can't help but suspect that the number of Republicans outweighed Democrats even more than Luntz wanted the Fox News viewers to think. As Media Matters noted about this clip, when the group began to express support for passing health care reform via reconciliation, Luntz changed the wording of the question to include the term \"nuclear option\" and got different results.

Theodore Ullyot, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, gave $2,500 to a committee in support of House Speaker John Boehner.\nAs a possible model of what Facebook might do politically, observers point to the experience of Google, which kept a low profile in Washington for years before ramping up its lobbying contracts and increasing its political giving.\nIn the 2003-04 election cycle, Google employees gave $356,004, mostly to Democratic candidates. That giving began to ramp up slowly after the company\u2019s 2004 IPO, with political giving peaking in 2008 at $2.3 million.\nIn 2011, as the presidential election cycle began heating up, company employees, their family members and the company\u2019s PAC gave $743,629, and the firm spent nearly $6 million on lobbying, according to Sunlight Foundation analysis.\nThe Facebook IPO may also produce potential political candidates.

But Assange's lawyers have a bigger concern: The US government wants to extradite Assange over hacking charges.\nIn an indictment unsealed on Thursday, the Justice Department charged Assange with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, after he allegedly agreed to crack a password for a classified US government computer. If convicted, Assange could face a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\nHis lawyers argued that the US' hacking allegations against Assange were an attack on press freedom.\n\"It's called conspiracy, it's a conspiracy to commit journalism,\" WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said at a press conference. \"We urge everybody to support Julian Assange in fighting his extradition.\"\nPress freedom advocates have spoken out against the arrest, arguing that Assange and WikiLeaks were working as journalists through the attempted hacking and publishing of classified information. But media law and security experts disagree with that argument.\nWhile what WikiLeaks published did have journalistic value -- military documents leaked in 2010 showed American attacks in Iraq -- Assange isn't protected if he committed a crime to obtain those documents, experts said.\n\"If someone else broke the law by hacking government sites and then turning over material to WikiLeaks, then that fits into a traditional journalistic function,\" said Roy Gutterman, a media law and free speech professor at Syracuse University. \"But if WikiLeaks personnel actually did the hacking, then the government might have a strong case.\"\nJournalists have published stolen and classified documents in the past, a press freedom protected through landmark Supreme Court cases like Bartnicki v. Vopper in 2001 and The New York Times v. United States in 1971.\nBut in both of those cases, the press was protected because it wasn't stealing the documents that it published.\nBy allegedly offering to hack the US' computers, Assange is going beyond what a journalist would do, said Dave Kennedy, chief executive at security consultancy TrustedSec.\n\"This is not a boundary that anybody would cross,\" Kennedy said. \"There's a fine line between interviewing somebody that robbed a bank, and helping that person rob the bank and then interviewing them.\"\nCourt documents allege that Assange communicated with Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley Manning), at that time an intelligence analyst in the US Army.\nOn March 8, 2010, Assange allegedly agreed to help Manning crack a password on a US Department of Defense computer network to obtain classified documents.\nFiguring out the password would have given Manning access to an account that didn't belong to her, and continue providing information over to WikiLeaks.\nIf WikiLeaks personnel actually did the hacking, then the government might have a strong case.\nUS prosecutors argue that the"}

It's about precisely conditioned athletes and the adrenaline junkies who ride them. It's about the colorful ritual that surrounds that most basic athletic pursuit, the foot race.\nFor me, it's not about calculating odds and picking winners, which is suspiciously like advanced-placement math. Horse racing is like craps--it's as simple or complicated as you want it to be. Even if you play only the pass line and make sucker bets in the field, the action at a craps table is exciting and engrossing. The action at a race track is at the betting window, but it's also feeling the power of a thousand-pound animal running 40 mph 20 yards from where you're standing at the rail.\nYou can love the fact that a horse can breathe only through its nose. That a horse breathes in rhythm with its stride, exhaling when its legs are extending, inhaling when they're bending inward, in a bellows effect. You can love the fact that a horse's chestnut, that knobby chunk of keratin on its inner leg, is as unique to an individual animal as a fingerprint is to a human.\nYou can love watching a Thoroughbred do what it was born to do anywhere, but this time of year in Southern California, the best Thoroughbreds return the affection only in Del Mar.\nOnce more popular among the younger generation than MMA is today, horse racing is hurting, thanks to competition from other forms of gambling, uninspired marketing and control-freak management. There's concern about doping and the occasional stomach-turning injury and death of animals that might love to run, but only because we make them. And, like hockey, horse racing is thrilling in person, but rather anemic on TV.\nWith only a couple of weeks left in the meet, now's your chance to love horse racing in Del Mar, even if you don't know your furlong from your fetlock. Back-dropped by the Pacific, the track beckons from the sclerotic I-5 that makes the commute from L.A. feel slower than a gimpy nag at the back of the pack at Also-Ran Downs.\nOn Sunday, Del Mar runs the richest and most prestigious race of its season--the TVG Pacific Classic, with a $1 million purse.

Yet you clearly realize not all people will perceive it as such. In fact, I don\u2019t think you perceive it as neutral (otherwise you would not have written this letter). So the real question is this: Are you interested in prominently displaying art that will cause some people to think differently \u2014 and perhaps negatively \u2014 about who you actually are? Again, this is not an ethical query. But it\u2019s worth considering.\nIf I walked into your home and saw a massive portrait of 1937 Germany, I would not think, the guy living here must be some kind of obsessive Nazi fetishist. But some reasonable people might. And if that happens, you can\u2019t feign outrage over their subsequent response. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re conscious of how this map might be taken. You can\u2019t argue, \u201cI had no idea this might bother people.\u201d If you hang an upside-down cross on your front door, it doesn\u2019t really matter that an upside-down cross historically represents the symbolic memory of St. Peter \u2014 certain strangers will still assume you\u2019re a Satanist (or at least a massive fan of the first Black Sabbath album). If you deliberately present an image that is prone to misinterpretation, you have to accept the consequences.\nNow, does that make hanging the image unethical? It does not. There\u2019s no ethical responsibility to avoid offending people who manufacture personal meanings. You can decorate the interior of your private residence in whatever manner you desire, and perhaps you don\u2019t care if other people misinterpret your aesthetics.

This would be a justifiable argument if theaters sold tickets for three-hour blocks of time, but that\u2019s not how the world works. Buying a ticket does not award you 180 minutes inside the walls of the building (which you can use in whatever way you want).

When you buy a ticket for an artistic event, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll like it. You can\u2019t argue that the ticket buyer is owed a film experience that meets his or her personal criteria for quality entertainment, because the only guarantee is that the advertised movie will be screened at that place at that time. Your critical opinion does not dictate a refund. And by changing theaters, you\u2019re hurting the creators of the film you saw without directly paying for it.

He subsequently kidnapped Senator Walter Reilly\u2019s daughter Lorraine and used her as a guinea pig, and she was turned into Firehawk. After sending her to kill Firestorm, Hewitt exposed himself to the nuclear explosion and became Tokamak. He had several bouts with the Nuclear Man over the years, and was eventually killed after he was separated from the clone of himself that he merged with in order to keep his body from failing. Tokamak hasn\u2019t been seen much in the modern era of comics, so an appearance on The Flash will help boost his profile for regular viewers and comic book fans who had forgotten about him.\nHewitt is the latest addition from the Firestorm mythos on The Flash.

Does this movie have an ulterior motive?\nThe week before \"The Patriot\" opened in the United States, the British press lit up with furious headlines. \"Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's War,\" read one in the Daily Telegraph. Another story, about the historical model for Mel Gibson's character was titled, \"The Secret Shame of Mel's New Hero.\" The accompanying articles complained that the new Revolutionary War epic portrays British redcoats as \"bloodthirsty and unprincipled stormtroopers\" and \"bloodthirsty child-killers.\"\nThe prizewinning historian and biographer Andrew Roberts called the film \"racist\" in the Daily Express, and pointed out that it was only the latest in a series of films like \"Titanic,\" \"Michael Collins\" and \"The Jungle Book\" remake that have depicted the British as \"treacherous, cowardly, evil [and] sadistic.\" Roberts had a theory: \"With their own record of killing 12 million American Indians and supporting slavery for four decades after the British abolished it, Americans wish to project their historical guilt onto someone else.\"\nI can only imagine how much angrier Fleet Street's pundits will be after they have actually seen the movie. \"The Patriot\" will not open in England until August, but when it does, Brits will see a supposedly authentic historical epic that radically rewrites the known history of the Revolutionary War. It does so by casting George III's redcoats as cartoonish paragons of evil who commit one monstrous -- but wholly invented -- atrocity after another. In one scene, the most harrowing of the film, redcoats round up a village of screaming women and children and old men, lock them in a church and set the whole chapel on fire. If you didn't know anything about the Revolution, you might actually believe the British army in North America was made up of astonishingly cruel, even demonic, sadists who really did do this kind of thing -- as if they were the 18th century equivalent of the Nazi SS. Yet no action of the sort ever happened during the war for independence, but an eerily identical war crime -- one of the most notorious atrocities of World War II -- was carried out by the Nazis in France in 1944.\nAs a film critic for the New York Post, I found \"The Patriot\" well made and often exciting. But I also found it disturbing in a way that many weaker, dumber films are not. It's not just that it willfully distorts history in a manner that goes way beyond the traditional poetic license employed by Hollywood, it's the strange, primitive politics that seem to underlie that distortion.\n\"The Patriot\" is a movie that doesn't \"get\" patriotism -- in either a modern or the 18th century sense of the word. The only memorable, explicit political sentiment voiced comes when Gibson's character makes the rather Tory comment that he sees no advantage in replacing the tyranny of one man 3,000 miles away for the tyranny of 3,000 men, one mile away. The deliberate lacuna demonstrates a total lack of understanding of, or even a kind of hostility to, the patriotic politics that motivated the founding fathers.\nYou could actually argue without too much exaggeration that \"The Patriot"}

Today is Gates' last day at Microsoft; he will continue to serve as the company's chairman (and will remain its largest shareholder), but he's said he'll spend 80 percent of his time at the foundation.\nOnce the most despised fellow in business, in the last decade, Gates' philanthropic work has cemented his standing as ... there's no casual way to say this, he's the leading statesman of our times.\nThe transformation has been so complete it seems difficult, anymore, to reconcile the old Bill and the new. Though you sometimes see flashes of the combative businessman -- Gates told Tom Brokaw the other day that he doesn't use an iPod because \"the Zune is a better way to carry your music around\" -- these moments seem contrived for comic effect. Caring about which music player wins the market is laughably frivolous beside Gates' grand ambitions of eradicating the planet of infectious diseases and the ravages of poverty.\nBill Gates has pulled off one of the greatest hacks in technology and business history, by turning Microsoft's success into a force for social responsibility. Imagine imposing a tax on every corporation in the developed world, collecting $100 per white-collar worker per year, and then directing one third of the proceeds to curing AIDS and malaria. That, effectively, is what Bill Gates has done.\nDash also points out the neat symmetry to Gates' career. In 1980, Mary Maxwell Gates, Bill's mother, got to know John Opel, the chairman of IBM, through their work at the United Way Foundation.\nAt the time, IBM was preparing to release the first PC, and it needed an operating system. Opel chose tiny Microsoft as its OS vendor partly on the strength of his connection to the Gates family -- a decision, Dash writes, \"that ended up being the greatest turning point in the history of the biggest software company that's ever been created.\"\nPhilanthropy played a key part in Gates' early success at Microsoft. And in a hundred years, philanthropy may be all anyone remembers him for."}

Here are some themes that emerged over the course of the weekend.\nAgainst Cornell, Princeton appeared to be in control midway through the second half. The Tigers held a 65\u201343 lead with just 11:44 remaining in the game before Cornell mounted a massive comeback. A 29\u20134 run over the next nine minutes gave Cornell a 72\u201369 lead with little time remaining. The Tigers battled back, and with just two seconds on the clock and Princeton trailing by one point, senior guard Amir Bell seized an offensive rebound and drew a foul, giving him a chance to win the game for the Tigers by draining two free throws. He missed the first but made the second to send the game to OT. The Tigers wasted another opportunity to end the game in the second OT with the score tied at 88. Bell missed a jumper at the buzzer, and the game went to another OT.\nPlaying another game the night after a triple overtime thriller is always a daunting proposition. This was evident Saturday night for the Tigers, who came out of the gates sluggish on the road against Columbia. Columbia leaped out to a 22\u20135 lead in the first seven minutes of Saturday\u2019s game, as Princeton struggled to make shots from the perimeter and defend effectively. The game would not get much closer, as Columbia took a 48\u201325 lead into the locker room for halftime and secured an 85\u201360 final.\nPrinceton shot well from outside against Cornell, making 16\u201338 or 42.1 percent from behind the arc. Junior guard Devin Cannady rebounded from last week\u2019s games, in which he was contained offensively by Harvard and Dartmouth, making six three-pointers against Cornell and scoring 32 points in total. Against Columbia, however, Princeton failed to knock down its three-point looks. The team shot 25 percent from three-point range, and Cannady was held to just 11 points.\nPrinceton\u2019s defense has been porous for the entirety of Ivy League play. The team has the third worst defense in the conference, giving up 77.3 points per game in conference play. This trend continued over the weekend, as the Tigers gave up 76 points in regulation against Cornell and 85 against Columbia. Any late season push towards the Ivy League tournament will have to begin on the defensive end.\nSituated in seventh place in the Ivy League with a 3\u20137 record, postseason play may seem like a pipe dream for this year\u2019s Tigers squad. Such a comeback, however, is not without precedent. Last year, Penn lost its first six games in conference play before winning six of its final eight to slide into the Ivy League tournament as the No. 4 seed, nearly pulling off an upset against 14\u20130 Princeton in the first round. Just one game behind a triad of teams tied for fourth place at 4\u20136, the Tigers are down, but certainly not out.\nPrinceton will return to the friendly confines of Jadwin Gymnas"}

In 2015, The Straits Times reported that the property had been listed at an asking price of $10 million. Kong said then it was a \"temporary home\" for the family as they awaited the sale.\nHe is now serving a 3 1/2-year jail sentence for misappropriating around $50 million of church funds.\nThe apartment remained unsold and was reportedly taken off the market before reappearing recently at a higher price.\nWhen contacted, the owners' agent Sally Soh, from KF Property Network, said the higher asking price was a decision made by her clients, but it is still up for negotiation.\nShe said three interested parties had enquired about the penthouse unit and paid it a visit since the listing was put up with the higher price tag.\nMost of the furnishings, including those in the spacious master bedroom, were left as her clients had intended, she said.\nIt is a good time for a buyer whose purpose is to live in the property, but investors should look at other asset classes as prices may not rise anytime soon.\n\"While the price is higher than in the past, the owners are open to negotiation if there is a firm offer from an interested buyer,\" she added.\nIf sold at the asking price, the value of the unit works out to $2,194 per sq foot (psf).\nThis is higher than that fetched by another unit in the same The Oceanfront condominium last month which, at $2,022 psf, is already above this year's median psf for Sentosa Cove properties - $1,579 psf - according to data from SRX Property.\nFor Sentosa Cove penthouses, the median psf in 2016 and 2017 was $1,628 and $1,802 respectively.\nThe latest listing follows a surge of interest in Sentosa Cove homes as prices gradually moved nearer the levels of mass-market condos, The Straits Times reported last month.\nSentosa Cove had of late come to be the most visible marker of the slump in the property market, after a series of homes were sold at massive losses.

{"idx": "22782", "prompt": "Continue the following text: And Tumwater Superintendent John Bash said his district is gradually losing some $7.25 million in school levy funds per school year over the 2017-2020 period. This wipes out most of the increase he expects to see in state funding.\nThe predicted allocation of state and local funds for Tumwater goes from about $78.1 million in 2017-18 to about $83.6 million in the 2018-19 school year. But that state and local support literally drops in 2019-20 to $81.7 million, based on estimates from the state Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction that Bash cited.\nEven so, schools, teachers, students and parents should be in good shape for the short term. All three school superintendents say the Legislature increased funding just enough in 2017 and then in March that they can cover their costs for the fall school year.\nUntil legislators found another $1 billion this year for schools, some districts had worried there could be staffing cuts.\nBut layoffs are off the table this year for North Thurston, Olympia and Tumwater schools, the superintendents said.\nThat is possible mainly because districts intend to keep using local property tax levies and reserves to cover gaps in state funding for teacher pay and for shortfalls in special education funding for the next school year.\nStill our Legislature is not off the hook for fully funding K-12 schools under terms of the state Supreme Court\u2019s McCleary decision, first decided in 2012.\nPlaintiffs for the McCleary family, which sued to get full funding of their children\u2019s schools a full decade ago, are still asking through their attorney for the court to keep jurisdiction of the case. This could keep pressure on lawmakers to follow through with ample funds in 2019, if not before.\nPredicted financial shortfalls for schools are nothing new. Cynics might say it is a negotiating stance that works for districts.\nBut this time the shortfalls come after full funding of schools was supposed to be assured.\nOne reason for the shortfall is the way lawmakers chose to raise funds for schools, which they did commendably to the tune of some $4 billion over several years at the state level.\nAt the same time the Legislature cut local school levy support and changed the way the state sends money to school districts to cover teacher salary increases. Salaries are a major cost of education, and districts with more experienced teachers expect to come up short by millions of dollars.\nThe salary problem results because new salary-allocation formulas are based on a statewide average for pay. This penalizes districts that have more experienced and more expensive teachers, including Olympia.\nTumwater is doubly hit. It did not receive an extra \u201cregionalization\u201d bonus that went to more than 90 school districts statewide, many in central Puget Sound where housing costs are very high, the superintendents explained.\nNorth Thurston receives a temporary boost in funds through a regionalization factor, because it is close to Tacoma. But that extra cash help fades away in a few years.\nOlympia gets a smaller temporary boost thanks to work by local lawmakers to sweeten the state funding formulas in the supplemental budget.\nLegislators also failed to fully pay the local costs of special education.\nThe state\u2019s high court still has to review the Legislature\u2019s latest progress or decide if the latest increase in state funds this year for salaries is enough to declare that Washington finally is paying the all of the"}

That knowledge would be important in understanding where oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may be headed.\nShould the eddy break away, there is a cone of uncertainty about its ultimate destination. A move to the north could mean added concern for the Florida Keys. A move to the west could heighten concerns in Texas and Mexico, Shay said.\nLt. Cmdr. Mark Sweeney, a NOAA pilot who was flight commander, called the Orion\u2019s track Friday a \u201cmowing-the-grass pattern,\u201d covering 1,939-miles.\nThe crew took off from MacDill Air Force Base at about 8:52 a.m. and flew southwest to a point west of the Dry Tortugas and then flew due west, dropping probes at predetermined grid coordinates.\nStarting point was 280 miles south of the Deepwater Horizon. This was the southern-most part of the grid over the eddy.\nAfter reaching the western edge of the grid, the Orion turned north for a short distance, and then tracked back east again. Eventually Kermit would make six east and west flights over the eddy, each precisely calculated and each one a little more to the north than the last one.\nTwo kinds of probes were being used. One measured the temperature of water at 1,000 feet. The other measured temperature and current at depths up to 4,800 feet, a metric mile.\n\u201cThis is our sixth flight. We\u2019ve being doing them every week to measure the changes,\u201d said Shay, a scientist for the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.\nThe flight Friday came as close as 45 nautical miles to the Deepwater Horizon site. At that close distance, occasional patches of oil could be seen floating on the surface.\nGoing into Friday\u2019s flight, crews had previously seen sheen as far away as 280 miles from Deepwater Horizon, Shay said.\nSoon after Kermit the Frog dropped its first probe, shortly after 10 a.m., several crew members pointed out patches of orange-brown material floating 280 miles from Deepwater Horizon.\n\u201cStuff on the surface,\u201d Shay said, frowning.\nLater, Sweeney said it might have been oil, or it could have been an algae bloom. Not everything that color is oil, he said.\nAs each new probe hit the water, crew members like Steven Paul and Carlos Quiles watched high-tech displays of data streaming in giving depth and temperature. And, in a time-honored low-tech way, they marked each probe dropped on a grid coordinate with pencil and paper.\n\u201cKnowing where these deepwater features are is a good idea,\u201d Shay said.\nThe Loop Current and the"}

The remaining two, Sullivan and Bruno, were cleared of all charges.\nBruno, a magisterial district judge from Chester County, had served on the Traffic Court bench only a few times a year as a substitute.\nA seventh defendant, Robert Moy, owner of a Chinatown translation business, also got off scot-free, having been charged with being in cahoots with two of the judges who allegedly fixed tickets for his clients.\nThe jurors, a mixed group in age, gender and overall demographics, returned the verdicts unanimously and were thanked by Stengel, as well as by each defense attorney during closing arguments. The jury had sat for more than two months in federal court as the case unfolded.\n\"The jury's verdict is a resounding statement on the limits that should be placed on the federal government's discretionary power to prosecute,\" said Paul Hetznecker, attorney for Moy.\n\"In this particular case, we've said from the beginning that this was an overreaching prosecution. The government went far beyond what we believe should happen in a democratic society.\"\nAfter court adjourned, family and friends exchanged hugs, while Assistant U.S. Attorneys Denise Wolf and Anthony Wzorek escaped questions from reporters.

It has no plans, however, to abandon more advanced gas projects it is involved with in Azerbaijan and Russia.\nAt a meeting near Athens, Cypriot Industry Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis said the three countries were more likely to share gas-produced electricity, using undersea cables, before exports were possible.\n\"With the most modest calculations, a period of eight years or more is required (for exports),\" Sylikiotis told an energy conference at this seaside resort.\n\"Undersea (gas) pipelines is a more difficult process, but of course laying undersea electricity cables is easier.\"\nOn the sidelines of the conference, Greece and Israel signed a water management cooperation agreement.

It is ably administered by top-notch officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, specifically the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in concert with the Social Security Administration.\nCurrently, individual states adopt their own rules associated with E-Verify compliance. There are no minimum or uniform standards for states, which makes it extremely difficult for employers to maintain compliance. Collectively, employers must work with Congress on reforms to reduce the burden of E-Verify compliance.\nWith both presidential candidates, a bipartisan majority in Congress, most state governors, state legislatures, and the American electorate finally recognizing the importance of E-Verify, perhaps the time has come for a federal congressionally-approved E-Verify mandate.\n2017 would appear to be the ideal time to develop such a standard.\nSo what would such a piece of legislation look like?\nThere are eight key elements Congress should consider when drafting new E-Verify legislation.\nA verification program of this nature requires a much greater and significant investment and more prioritization.\nToday, employers use a government website or custom software to communicate with E-Verify. Introduced in 2006, the custom software option, known as Web Services, now accounts for over 50% of E-Verify activity.\nGiven the pace of technology, it\u2019s time to reallocate federal funding to focus on the future infrastructure of E-Verify and Web Services.\nAs it stands, state E-Verify statutes are different; and they keep changing.\nFederal employees, employees of certain state governments, employees hired in certain states, and employers found to be non-compliant in the past, are all required to use E-Verify.\nTo reduce burdens and penalties, employers need a federal E-Verify mandate so they only have to comply with one set of rules and employees in every state are treated the same.\nCongress should waste no time in passing a federal E-Verify mandate to unburden employers, help ensure a safe work environment, protect jobs for authorized workers, and defend E-Verify from cyber-attack.\nFor FY2016, E-Verify will process roughly 20 million cases.\nOver 10 million of those will use Web Services.\nIf federally mandated, E-Verify must expand capacity to process 100 million cases per year, which accounts for currently proposed enhancements to the system as well as increasing employment.\nAlso, E-Verify must eliminate maintenance outages. The solution is complicated and will require infrastructure upgrades for E-Verify and other government systems that verify employment eligibility.\nE-Verify goes offline every night because other government systems integrated with E-Verify also go offline each night.\nThe fact is, employers hire 24 hours a day. Third shift employees are hired during third shift.\nGovernment systems must be required to reduce \u2013 not add \u2013 to the burdens on employers.\nFifth, Web Services and specifically, user identification.\nE-Verify must be able to identify individuals"}

A Disney spokeswoman would not confirm the number.\nDisney\u2019s games and online division has for years been a persistent money loser and a small but significant drag on a corporate empire that spans movie-making and television to cable network ESPN, theme parks and cruise lines.\nAs with other major game publishing houses, Disney has been trying to keep up with rapidly shifting consumer preferences and an explosion in mobile gaming worldwide. In 2010, it bought mobile game developer Playdom for over $500 million, an acquisition that has yet to bear significant fruit.\nLast year, Disney Interactive lost $87 million as revenues rose 26 percent from 2012; the division has lost a total in recent years of more than $1 billion.\nIn Disney\u2019s fiscal first quarter that ended on December 28, the unit reported $55 million in operating income.\nDisney now plans to license most of its games to earn additional revenue, Pitaro said.\nIt will continue to develop games and content for its \u201cInfinity\u201d platform, a combination video game and toy line; it has sold more than 3 million copies of the platform globally since its August release.\nThat line, which echoes Activision Blizzard Inc\u2019s \u201cSkylanders\u201d product, is viewed as a pivotal element in Disney\u2019s effort to revive the interactive division.\nDisney will continue to make kid-friendly mobile games and short videos for YouTube, Disney.com and elsewhere, Pitaro said.\nThe company also intends to adjust its online strategy and streamline its diverse websites.\nIt will close two smaller sites, Spoonful.com and BabyZone.com, and revamp Disney.com to use its primary website more as a promotional site for its retail, parks and other businesses.\nDisney will continue to generate advertising revenues from Disney.com and will increase the amount of content it produces in conjunction with sponsors, Pitaro said.\nFor instance, Disney produced a 38-minute video with Google called \u201cBlank: A Vinylmation Love Story.\u201d In December, it announced it would make a series of animated shorts with Rosetta Stone that Pitaro said would be the model for future joint efforts."}

Graphics and linked resources traversing the Internet? The concept blew me away. I immediately immersed myself in the Web, and soon realized that nearly every page was an amateur production. Here was a tremendous publishing opportunity and a wetware challenge: I could offer up my own writings, engage the Web with links, and wouldn&apos;t have to pay a publisher in the process. Content would be key, however; no one would visit if it wasn&apos;t engaging. Many Web posters obviously knew how to use HTML, but didn&apos;t necessarily have anything to say (a fate I wanted to avoid).\nI learned the basics of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) \u2013 the lexicon of the Web \u2013 inside a weekend. All the necessary information was online. I fired up my graphic WWW browser and a basic text editor (SimpleText, or any similar text editor will do), then retrieved the source code for a page I admired (most browsers will allow you to download the hypertext version, or guts of the page you are looking at \u2013 try the \"View Source\" option). I studied how one translated to the other by comparing the source code with the finished product, checking against the official hypertext of the online reference guide (\"A Beginner&apos;s Guide to HTML\": http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html).\nWithin a few hours, I had a working knowledge of HTML, a programming language I found to be similar to text formatting on old DOS word processors \u2013 simple formatting codes surrounding applicable text. By the end of the weekend, I had set up a copy of MacHTTP \u2013 a freeware program that serves Web pages from Macs connected to the Internet \u2013 to serve \"Justin&apos;s Home Page\" from my PowerBook 180.\nAs time progressed, I sought to make my page an interesting, informative e-zine, and renamed it \"Links From the Underground\" in homage to a book of dark musings by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I established references and cross-references across the Net by surfing extensively, recording my sessions, and contacting other page publishers. I wanted my site to have the same dynamic feel as the Web itself. Every two or three weeks, I would reapproach my site, or a specific section, and redesign it. Many Web pages are stagnant soon after they are posted; the pages that sustain energy are both rare and obvious. People will return, usually with friends, to a unique and dynamic site.\nTo be a Web publisher of the first order, however, you need to have your own server, or at least one over which you have a good deal of control. You will want to tinker with the workings of the hypertext server, adding forms and scripts for interactive and other advanced functions. But hardware constraints shouldn&apos;t dissuade you.

{"idx": "22818", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: At the Berlinale 2009 the WSWS had the opportunity to speak with Rainer Simon about his work as a film director in the German Democratic Republic (formerly East Germany).\nSimon was born in 1941. As a youth he had a number of important experiences which cast doubt on the \u201csocialist\u201d character of the GDR. Once he became acquainted with a 14-year-old boy who had been imprisoned by the Red Army in a concentration camp immediately after the war. The young boy had been accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. At the same time, one of the teachers at Simon\u2019s school in East Germany was a former convinced Nazi who had joined the Stalinist Socialist Unity Party (SED) after the war. Following protests from the pupils the teacher was removed, but only to be sent to another school.\nInterested in natural science, Simon quit the church at 16, entered the SED a year later and agitated on behalf of the party amongst farmers who were reluctant to allow their land to be nationalized.\nSimon\u2019s allegiance to the SED suffered a serious blow when news of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s criticisms of Stalin in 1956 slowly penetrated the GDR. With a bunch of colleagues, Simon founded the Collective 63 at film school. The mandate of the group was to show the GDR as it was, with all its warts. Such a perspective was too much for the party bureaucracy, however, which organized a type of Stalinist tribunal following political criticism made on a wall newspaper. This was a critical experience for Simon. The year was 1964, following the ouster of Khrushchev, whose policy of accelerated industrial expansion had led to a wave of strikes in the Soviet Union.\nFearing similar protests in the GDR, the 11th Plenum of the SED in 1965 corrected the \u201cexaggeration\u201d of the \u201cperformance principle.\u201d At the same time the party began to move against artists. Among the films banned at this time was Traces of Stones (1966) directed by Frank Beyer. In the film, workers in a labour brigade threaten to strike against supervisors and the SED to protest the lack of building material. A number of other films from this period featuring conflicts between young workers and the SED were also proscribed. Simon\u2019s first film project dealt with a similar issue\u2014young people attempting to evade the pervasive control of the bureaucracy.\nSimon became an assistant to the director Ralf Kirsten who made a film about the expressionist sculptor Ernst Barlach (The Lost Angel [Der verlorene Engel], 1966), which was also initially banned. Simon came into contact as well with the filmmaker Konrad Wolf, who, in 1967 had finished his autobiographical film about the end of war in Berlin, I was Nineteen (Ich war neunzehn, released in 1968).\nWolf (1925-1982), was the son of the writer and German Communist Party member Friedrich Wolf. His brother Markus was later to become chief of the East German foreign intelligence service. The Wolf family had taken refuge from fascism in the Soviet Union and lived in Moscow during the period of Stalinist purges.\nOn one occasion Simon asked Konrad Wolf about the purges in the USSR and the reaction of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the Hitler-Stalin pact. Simon found Wolf\u2019s response unsatisfactory. Wolf spoke about the \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u2019 fear in the context of the"}

In the meantime, director David Ayer has been taking to Twitter recently to tease his followers on his research process during preproduction, from showing the kind of weapons the team members will be using to how lead character Harley Quinn\u2019s insanity will be represented. As far as source material goes, Ayer has already shown that some of the movie\u2019s elements will be pulled from the first volume of the New 52 Suicide Squad, but taking history into account, the director has also revealed that Suicide Squad will also take inspiration from the classic run that made the team famous in the DC universe.\nThis was followed an earlier Tweet where Ayer asked, \"The eternal question: To canon, or not to canon?\" Despite the New 52 rendering any pre-2011 Suicide Squad stories non-canon, it\u2019s refreshing that Ayer is willing to delve into the classic source material rather than just base his movie on what\u2019s happening currently in the comics.\nAlthough this is the first official confirmation that Suicide Squad will be drawing from the stories John Ostrander wrote, it has been hinted at previously. DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns sent out this tweet last December that implied that the the movie would be based upon the classic run.\nCould not be more excited for the cast of Squad! @jfostrander 's run is one of the best and underrated in comics history IMO. Start reading.\nThe Suicide Squad was originally created in 1959 as a team of adventurers that fought monsters, but it was Ostrander that created the modern incarnation of the Squad that we know and love. Lasting nearly 70 issues, his run established that the Squad as a The Dirty Dozen-type group of incarcerated criminals that were sent on extremely dangerous missions by the U.S. government. The only issue that can clearly be made out is Suicide Squad Vol. 1, #37. This issue was part of the \"Coils of LOA\" storyline, which featured the team (including Deadshot) on a mission to assassinate the LOA - a group that was planning to create a zombie army. It\u2019s unclear whether an aspect of this story will be used in the film\u2019s plot of if Ayer is simply looking through it to study the characters.\nCurrently, the only way to read the majority of Ostrander's stories is to find single issues at your local comic book store or on Comixology.com, but as the release date for Suicide Squad gets closer, DC Comics would be wise to republish these classic stories in new trade paperbacks or an omnibus hardcover. That way, people who either enjoyed the movie or want to learn about these characters ahead of time can jump into these classic stories rather than just be stuck with the New 52 volumes."}

Clambakes are one of Cleveland's favorite feasts.\nYou needn't look far to find them, in newspaper ads, in church bulletins, on the airwaves. And on neighbors' decks and patios.\nDespite the fact that we're several hundred miles from the nearest ocean, Northeast Ohio ranks among the nation's largest consumers of clams and clambakes.\n\"Without question, this area pulls more clams, collectively, than any other city in America,\" says Jim Catanese of Classic Seafood in Cleveland.\n\"I worked in New York City, at Fulton Fish Market, and they were constantly amazed by the demand here,\" Catanese says.\nOhio's historical links to New England may be a key to that appetite, he says, but generations of strong marketing play a role as well.\n\"Years and years ago, the old-timers developed a seafood business that -- in a traditionally slow time of year here -- found a niche,\" Catanese says. \"They developed a business with the corn that was being harvested, the sweet potatoes being dug, and clams coming into season.\n\"It hasn't really lost any steam or momentum at all,\" he adds.\nThe ingredients rarely vary. Anyone who's dug into a couple of local bakes can rattle off the key elements. Typically they include a dozen clams (usually tied in a mesh bag), half a chicken, a sweet potato, ear of corn and a roll and butter. Coleslaw and clam broth are usually part of the deal.\nVariations abound, of course -- steak instead of chicken, redskin potatoes to replace the yams, skip the broth and spoon up some creamy chowder.\nAlong the Atlantic coast where \"shore dinners\" are common weekend gatherings in season, chicken isn't always part of the equation.\n\"The East Coast clambake tends to include fish of some kind, usually cod,\" says Catanese. Soft-shell or \"steamer\" clams are favored (\"they think the steamers are sweeter,\" he says) though when that variety is special-ordered here, it's usually for deep-frying in clam rolls.\nElliott Lewis, fishmonger for Whole Foods Market in University Heights, thinks it's a mistake to omit chicken from the steamer.\n\"Here people sometimes grill the chicken on the side -- but that steals flavor from the broth,\" says Lewis, who started out as a crabber on the coast of North Carolina and has spent the past 27 years cutting fish.\n\"Adding chicken and live seaweed to the steamer keeps the moisture and flavor in the fish and other ingredients,\" he says.\nOne big change over the years has been the gradual shift away from serving steamed cherrystone clams, in favor of middleneck or topneck varieties.\n\"Once they open up, they're chewy -- real chewy,\" Lewis says.\n\"Years ago, everyone bought cherrystones,\" Catanese agrees. \"Now if someone wants to buy cherrystones, I try to talk them out of it.\"\nThat's because their"}

Duterte seems increasingly enraged at his critics and has increased pressure on independent media and other checks on his government. Orban has tried to further subjugate the courts to his rule. In a particularly harsh case, Maduro may have had opponents killed.\nTargeting international institutions. A coalition of right-leaning populist parties has joined to contest elections for the European Parliament, to be held in May, in the hopes of boosting their influence. As Mark Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations notes, if the populist parties win enough seats, they may be able to use their power to impede the Parliament\u2019s ability to censure European autocratic populists endangering the rule of law.\nDoubling down on provocative policies and playing up wedge issues. Duterte has vowed to continue his brutal drug war, known for its extrajudicial killings, and promised the country more bloodshed. For nearly all autocratic-leaning populists, compromise is anathema and holding their political base critical.\nWhat to watch: Although these leaders operate in different political systems, their responses have much in common, and might offer clues about the Trump presidency\u2019s next two years. Back in Washington, expect few moves toward compromise, new salvos fired at U.S. institutions, and \u2014 as evident in the State of the Union \u2014 a dogged willingness to push the most controversial policies, like the border wall, even as the public tires of such ideas.\nJoshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations."}

It brought together several animal advocacy groups, concerned about the lack of any statistics on the overall size and migration within the DC feline population. The activists hope that the data they gather by June 2021 will not only help researches understand how well-off and low-life felines interact with each other, but also provide \"scientifically sound tools and protocols\" that could be used in the future to manage the cat population.\nThis is not a trivial task, as, according to the 2016 survey on the damage done by \"invasive predators\" to global biodiversity, the purring creatures have been responsible for the extinction of 63 species.\nIn order to achieve this far-reaching goal, the researches plan to install \"state-of-the-art\" camera traps in the streets, which will allow them to capture the movements of even the most cautious and elusive felines. Simultaneously, a survey will be carried out to determine how many cats are living as pets and how much time they typically spend their time outdoors. Cats in animal shelters won't be overlooked either, as researches plan to count intake and outflow rates.\nFor the count of the homeless cats to be more precise, the researches will double-check the data obtained by the camera traps by going out into the field and then comparing the two numbers.\nThis is about more than just counting cats \u2013 it's science, researcher John Boone assured the Washington Post.\n\"We're investigating \u2014 scientifically \u2014 the underlying dynamics of this system.

Rates have dropped in major metropolitan areas such as Miami and Dallas by as much as 30 percent. Some places, such as Denver, report more modest decreases. Overall though, the climate at the national summit held in Denver recently for those involved in developing 10-year plans to end homelessness was pretty ecstatic.\nBut for the tens of millions of people who live in rural America, and for families everywhere with children, the news is pretty bad - they just simply didn't get counted.\nThe problem is, there are so many definitions of homelessness for so many different programs, no one is quite sure anymore exactly what \"homeless\" means. Families with children who cannot access shelters simply can't consider the streets an option. So they are often found doubled - and tripled-up with friends and relatives, and frequently move between multiple locations. While they may be considered homeless by the local school district, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) doesn't think so. These people might be able to access healthcare services if there is a homeless clinic in the neighborhood, but they won't be able to get food stamps as an individual or a family. And they will probably put the family that was willing to take them in at risk of losing their housing. None of these folks got counted in the 2006 Street Count.\nAccording to the United States Conference of Mayors, requests for shelter by families with children went unmet 32 percent of the time in 2004 - and families with children make up the fastest-growing segment among the homeless. Fifty-six percent of the reporting cities say that homeless families have to break up in order to find shelter. At least 3.5 million persons are likely to experience homelessness during a year in the United States and 40 percent of them will be children. None of these children got counted this year, either.\nFamilies without stable housing face transportation barriers that make job retention and children's school continuity difficult. But because we can't get HUD to agree with the Department of Education or with the Department of Health and Human Services on a single definition of homelessness, these families are often stuck in a downward spiral, unable even to begin the process of trying to be self-sufficient.\nThere is no town, city, or state anywhere in America where an individual or family working full-time and earning the minimum wage can afford a one- or two- bedroom apartment at the fair market rental rate established by HUD. Just this week, the National Association of Realtors put the median price for a modest home in the US at more than $200,000.\nThe US Conference of Mayors has requested by resolution that the ICH and the president call for all federal departments and funding sources to adopt a common definition of homelessness. Perhaps they should listen more to the mayors who are actually seeing what goes on in their cities and towns every day, instead of depending on numbers gathered by four hours of schlepping through the streets of our biggest cities one night a year.\nThis kind of effort and cooperation would go a long way in helping all communities provide a consistent level of help and support for children and their parents. It might even give us a valid count. But instead, ICH met in Denver to celebrate numbers that don't seem to have much real meaning to people across America struggling to find shelter and keep their families intact.\nAffordable housing,"}

After Coca-Cola Zero Sugar comes to the U.S., Coke Zero will be phased out.\nThe replacement is very similar to Coke Zero in taste, Beverage Digest executive editor Duane Stanford said. The ingredient list is exactly the same, meaning the formulation likely was tweaked only slightly.\n\"It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s some complete overhaul of the formula,\" he said. \"It\u2019s really as much about the package redesign and repositioning as anything. One of the things they\u2019re trying to do is make it 100% clear that there is no sugar in the product and that it is a no-calorie product.\"\nCoke CEO James Quincey acknowledged that customers were confused.\n\"It may surprise you to learn, but it\u2019s true that consumers have not always been clear that either Diet Cokes or Coke Zeroes are absolutely zero sugar. That\u2019s just a fact of consumer research,\" he said on a conference call.\nWith Coke also selling other Zero-branded sodas, including Sprite Zero and Cherry Zero, Quincey said the company \"is taking a harder look at can we improve those formulas\" as well.\nThe company will invest in \"substantial marketing and media support\" to introduce the new brand, Quincey said. That will include a national tour where consumers will be given free samples and educated about the drink.\n\"Coca-Cola\u2019s strategy, in general, is very pointed because they want to go where consumers are going, and that means offering more products that allow people to control their sugar and calorie intake,\" Stanford said.\nThe company on Wednesday reported flat beverage sales globally for the second quarter but said it was encouraged by the performance of no-calorie and low-calorie sodas in foreign markets. Sales of drinks prepared for immediate consumption also provided a lift.\nThe beverage giant's total drink sales were effectively unchanged, compared to a year ago, but the company said the performance of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was a bright spot.

Here's a look at just how much all that costs for parents in Greenville County Schools, ahead of the first day of classes on Monday.\nAs with many of these expenses, there may be some variation on what school supplies cost, but on average a list will run about $20 to $30 at the elementary school level, before jumping \"a lot higher\" once students need expensive items like graphing calculators in high school, said Christie Payne, principal of Sue Cleveland Elementary.\nClothes, and especially shoes, are a major expense cited by many Greenville County parents.\nThat can add up to $300 to $350 per child, even when shopping clearance sales, said Greenville County parent Ashley Wood.\nSeven Greenville County middle schools and three elementary schools also require some sort of uniform, said Beth Brotherton, spokeswoman for the district.

Self-driving cars could change the way we commute. Biometric technology could make identity verification and personal security far more advanced and reliable. And of course, in a few years, our homes might be chock-full of smart devices meant to automate and simplify our lives.\nBut along the way, consumers, lawmakers, and even business leaders are obstructing the path toward progress by highlighting the fears they have of these technologies\u2019 inherent vulnerabilities.\n1. Self-driving cars could be taken over. Lawmakers and self-driving car opponents often claim that autonomous vehicles are inherently unsafe because they could be remotely taken over by a sufficiently motivated hacker, and potentially used as hostages or for malicious destruction of property.\n2. Drones could be intercepted. In the last mile of delivery, drones could be intercepted by hackers (or by watchful pedestrians with big nets).\n3. Biometrics could be forged. You don\u2019t even need to be a hacker to forge someone\u2019s fingerprints; with enough access to a person\u2019s body or personal data, you could replicate almost any biometric signature.\n4. Smart devices could reveal your personal data. IoT devices are always listening, which can be a privacy issue; if hackers, or malicious individuals within the \u201clistening\u201d organizations attain and review that data, it could be used against you.\nThese are all sound insights; these vulnerabilities do exist, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge them, so we can find better ways to protect consumers.\nHowever, it\u2019s counterproductive to use these vulnerabilities as points of argument against the validity of the technology, or as grounding obstacles to prevent these technologies from becoming more developed or accessible to consumers.\n1. Older technologies are hackable too. Though smartphones and computer code have only been accessible for the past few decades, older forms of technology were \u201chackable\u201d in their own way. For example, if you\u2019re worried that someone with malicious intentions will take control of your self-driving car, were you also worried about someone hotwiring your car in the mid-1990s, or hijacking your car on the street? Vulnerabilities will exist at every stage of technology, new and old alike.\n2. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cunhackability.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to make a technology that\u2019s completely unhackable. Every new advancement we make in the realm of digital security is going to be met with an equal step forward in the cybercriminal circuit. As engineers come up with more and more clever ways to guard their sensitive information, hackers will come up with more inventive ways to penetrate it. To demand perfection from our security standards is fruitless.\n3. All technologies will require frequent updating and improvement. There\u2019s a reason your phone and desktop are constantly asking you to apply updates; it\u2019s because developers are constantly on the lookout for new threats, and understand that they\u2019ll need to regularly commit patches to guard against those threats. No matter what kind of new technology is introduced, it\u2019s going to take several years of exploration and live testing to discover new bugs to be ironed out. After that, it\u2019s going to require constant monitoring to guard against new bugs, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Technology can\u2019t reach its peak security in the prototype stage.\n4.

Blocking the production of this RNA molecule stops development in its tracks, they found.\nThe discovery comes on the heels of a Stanford study earlier this year showing that early human embryos are packed full of what appear to be viral particles arising from similar left-behind genetic material.\nSebastiano is a co-lead and co-senior author of the study, published online Nov. 23 in Nature Genetics. Postdoctoral scholar Jens Durruthy-Durruthy, PhD, is the other lead author. The other senior author of the paper is Renee Reijo Pera, PhD, a former professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford who is now on the faculty of Montana State University.\nSebastiano and his colleagues were interested in learning how cells become pluripotent, or able to become any tissue in the body. A human egg becomes pluripotent after fertilization, for example. And scientists have learned how to induce other, fully developed human cells to become pluripotent by exposing them to proteins known to be present in the very early human embryo. But the nitty-gritty molecular details of this transformative process are not well understood in either case.\nThe researchers knew that a type of RNA molecules called long-intergenic noncoding, or lincRNAs, have been implicated in many important biological processes, including the acquisition of pluripotency. These molecules are made from DNA in the genome, but they don\u2019t go on to make proteins. Instead they function as RNA molecules to affect the expression of other genes.\nSebastiano and Durruthy-Durruthy used recently developed RNA sequencing techniques to examine which lincRNAs are highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells. Previously, this type of analysis was stymied by the fact that many of the molecules contain highly similar, very repetitive regions that are difficult to sequence accurately.\nThey identified more than 2,000 previously unknown RNA sequences, and found that 146 are specifically expressed in embryonic stem cells. They homed in on the 23 most highly expressed sequences, which they termed HPAT1-23, for further study. Thirteen of these, they found, were made up almost entirely of genetic material left behind after an eons-ago infection by a virus called HERV-H.\nHERV-H is what\u2019s known as a retrovirus. These viruses spread by inserting their genetic material into the genome of an infected cell. In this way, the virus can use the cell\u2019s protein-making machinery to generate viral proteins for assembly into a new viral particle. That particle then goes on to infect other cells. If the infected cell is a sperm or an egg, the retroviral sequence can also be passed to future generations.\nHIV is one common retrovirus that currently causes disease in humans.

Lewis\u2019 writings during college and read many of his works each year to strengthen my faith. His perspectives on scripture, faith, and God make you think for yourself and challenges you to think about your faith at a deeper level.\nThese C.S. Lewis quotes are some of the most inspirational of all his quotes and may be the encouragement you need today.\nOne of the most powerful passages from Mere Christianity is C.S. Lewis\u2019 response to those who claim that Jesus was merely a \u2018great moral teacher, but not God.\u2019 Every time I read this, I\u2019m reminded that we serve the one and only true God who came to save humanity through his son Jesus.\nI am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I\u2019m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don\u2019t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic \u2014 on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg \u2014 or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\nHere\u2019s another article with even more C.S. Lewis Quotes.\nHave you ever read a book by C.S. Lewis? Which of these C.S. Lewis Quotes is your favorite?\nAn excellent list of Lewis quotes. Like you I read all of his writings in college, but I believe it may be time to read them again. Such a great writer, his impact goes on.\nI wasn\u2019t aware of some of these books. I will definitely check them out.\nI only know the Narnia side of C.S. Lewis. I didn\u2019t realize he did so much Christian writing too. My favorite quote above is one of the non-religious ones though\u2026.the one about turning 30. It is strange how at that age we suddenly have to face being adults as if we truly weren\u2019t for the last 10 years or so.\nI just love that! I think that came from Mere Christianity which I have not yet read. I\u2019ll need to, especially after reading some of the other quotes on here from that book!\nI love the last quote too, about how Jesus is either a madman, a devil or God. It is so true, if you look at the things he said, there really is not much middle ground..\nEither this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.\nThis was such a nice way to start the day, and I always find inspiration from C.S. Lewis. I loved the Narnia series as a child, and I have several of his books on my \u201cTo Read List,\u201d I just need to make the time to read them :) Thank you for sharing this!"}
{"idx": "22866", "prompt": "Continue the following text: WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Delaware officials asked a judge Friday to dismiss a lawsuit filed on behalf of two Belgian scientists who claim the state improperly used its abandoned property laws to seize their shares in a pharmaceutical firm, cheating them out of $12 million when it was acquired by drug giant Merck & Co. in 2014.\nAttorneys for the state argued that the lawsuit was filed after the allowable time period, that the claims are inadequate under the law, and that the scientists have been reimbursed the fair value of their shares at the time they were sold in 2009.\nAttorneys representing two holding companies owned by Gilles Gosselin and Jean Louis Imbach argued that Delaware had no legal authority to seize their foreign-owned shares in Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. The company was incorporated in Delaware in 2002 as the successor to a firm established in 1998 to develop a new hepatitis drug synthesized by a research team led by Gosselin and Imbach.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Computershare, a company acting as a transfer agent for Idenix, erroneously reported to Delaware in 2008 that 560,000 Idenix shares owned by the scientists had been \u201cabandoned\u201d and were unclaimed property.\nState officials took ownership of the shares and sold them at market value in 2009 for $1.7 million.\nBut the scientists claim that after they spent years inquiring about their shares, Delaware officials did not confirm until May 2014 that the shares had been seized, and that state officials were \u201cwaiting for the proceeds from the sale to be applied.\u201d In fact, the shares had been sold five years earlier.\nA month after state officials confirmed that they had the shares, Merck announced a tender offer for outstanding Idenix common stock at $24.50 per share. If Gosselin and Imbach had sold their 560,000 shares at that price, they would have received $13.7 million.\nInstead, the state in 2015 sent them a check for $1.7 million, the market value of their shares when they were sold without their knowledge.\n\u201cWe paid them just compensation. We paid them fair market value,\u201d Rosenthal said.\nBrauerman argued that state officials acted negligently and in bad faith, and that they violated his clients\u2019 due process rights in depriving them of their shares.\nAbandoned property is a critical source of funding for Delaware\u2019s state government, amounting to more than half a billion dollars annually and representing the state\u2019s third-largest revenue category.\nUnder U.S. Supreme Court rulings, states follow a two-tier scheme for reporting and claiming abandoned property. Under the primary priority rule, unclaimed property is reported to the state of the owner\u2019s last known address appearing on a company\u2019s records. But if the owner\u2019s address is unknown or incomplete, the unclaimed property is reported to the company\u2019s state of incorporation. Because so many corporations are formed in Delaware, the state benefits significantly from the second-priority rule.\nSlights gave no indication on when he might rule."}

Before that, Grambling will hold its annual Black and Gold game Saturday, April 13 at noon at Eddie G. Robinson Memorial Stadium.\nThe News-Star breaks down each position as the Tigers work through spring drills. The \u201cSpring Cleaning\u201d series kicks off for GSU with the quarterbacks, where the situation has more clarity entering spring than a season ago.\n2018 recap: In retrospect, Grambling State head football coach Broderick Fobbs said he should\u2019ve handled the quarterback battle between Hickbottom and Clark differently last year. The two signal callers split the bulks of the fall practice first-team reps and in-game snaps through the first four weeks of the season, a stretch Grambling stumbled through at 1-2, and it wasn\u2019t until the fourth quarter of the fifth game against Prairie View A&M at the Cotton Bowl where Fobbs finally saw what he needed to see out the eventual starting quarterback. Hickbottom ultimately seized the Tigers job with a near comeback after the team trailed the Panthers by 20 points entering the final period. The 6-4, 210-pound quarterback ended his first season as the starter completing 56 percent of his passes for 1,945 yards and 16 touchdowns along with nine interceptions. He was also the team\u2019s leading rusher with 500 yards and had eight touchdowns on the ground. For Clark, he appeared in eight games, going 46-for-86 (53.4 percent) for 380 yards and five picks to zero touchdowns.\n2019 outlook: What a difference a year makes. Last spring, Clark, an Arkansas State transfer, wasn\u2019t even in the picture yet but the quarterback position was still up-for-grabs. He joined the program in early summer and pushed for playing time right away. With the way he ended 2018, the starter spot is unquestionably Hickbottom\u2019s to lose, but the battle will remain open. Fobbs likes the amount of quality depth there is at the position, having three players with game experience. Hickbottom said he wants to build on his consistency this spring. Cutting down on mistakes will be a big priority for Grambling State\u2019s offense, Fobbs said, and that starts with the quarterback, where Hickbottom and Clark combined for 17 turnovers.\nAnalysis: With certainty, comes comfort. And with an experienced quarterback back at the helm, adjusting to new offensive coordinator Mark Orlando has been smooth through the first eight sessions of spring. Orlando has brought even more tempo than what the G-Men offense has boasted in the recent past and the new OC has told the News-Star that he\u2019s enamored by the athletic ability of both Hickbottom and Clark. I suspect the quarterbacks to heavily featured in the scheme, pass and run, come football season."}

The Heat ranked 24th in the NBA in three-point percentage last season.\nGreen, 6-8, has shot 36.8 percent from three-point range in his career, higher than any other guard or small forward on the Heat roster except Tyler Johnson.\nThe 29-year-old Green has done it despite losing a significant portion of his right ring finger in a basketball accident in the sixth grade.\nGreen was wearing his mother\u2019s class ring when he tried to dunk on a makeshift rim. The ring caught on a nail and ripped his finger down to the bone. Doctors said the only option was amputation near the middle knuckle.\nGreen overcame that setback, starred at Gulf Shores Academy in Houston and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 1 high school player in the class of 2005.

That lump payment was divided among the drivers and sent with their paychecks two weeks ago, Kelley said.\nThe district also agreed to extend the drivers' health benefits for two months after their layoffs on June 30, a concession worth about $100,000.\nAltogether, the drivers received a severance package totaling about $600,000.\nKelley said a bulk of that came from savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget. The $300,000 surplus \"is not unusual,\" said Kelley, and was made up of payroll changes and other alterations to the schools' spending plan this past year that town accountants did not calculate until the end of May, after the budget season had come to a close.\nKelley said municipal and school departments often budget for what they think is needed at the beginning of each fiscal year, an approach that can often yield savings at the close that is then turned over to the town as free cash.\nThe extra circuit breaker funds, on the other hand, were an unusually significant amount of aid to the town this time of year, said school Business Director Edward Gotgart. The funds came in after the state recalculated its reimbursement rate to the town based on the schools' final special education costs in fiscal 2010, he said.\nEvery year the state reimburses towns a certain percentage of the expenses the district incurred enrolling high-cost special education students.\n\"It's not unusual, but it's a lot more than usual,\" Gotgart said of the state's late readjustment to Framingham's cut. \"We usually just hope it's going to be in the positive.\"\nGotgart said the circuit breaker money wasn't directly used to pay for the settlement, but instead freed up other funds in the fiscal 2011 budget for that purpose.\nGoing into fiscal 2012 with a clean slate \"is great news,\" Gotgart said, especially as the district attempts to rebuild from several years of heavy cuts to services and staff."}

After all, who wouldn't want to contribute to a potentially revolutionary transportation system that would shoot people across vast distances at high speeds through a giant network of tubes?\nThe idea's attracted the attention of at least two startups, who may want to take a look at the work of the 124 student teams gathered at Texas A&M University for the inaugural Hyperloop Pod Competition. The event challenged students from universities (and three high schools) around the world to design a prototype capsule, or pod, that would carry passengers through those tubes. Twenty-two teams, which had names like Team Hyperlynx (University of Colorado, Denver) and Team WARR (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen), won a trip to California in June to test those pods on the Hyperloop test track SpaceX is building.\nTop honors, for best overall design, went to the crew from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That isn't terribly surprising, as MIT is a renowned engineering school, after all, but what's funny is the concept won even though it quite deliberately did not include space for people, or even cargo.\nThe Hyperloop, which Musk first mentioned in 2012 and more fully described in a 57-page white paper released the following year, is a network of above-ground tubes that would stretch hundreds of miles. Levitating capsules filled with people would zip through the extremely low air pressure of the tubes at near-supersonic speed. Musk encouraged anyone interested to pursue the idea, since he\u2019s sorta busy running Tesla Motors and SpaceX.\nSince then, two companies have stepped up to make this happen. Hyperloop Technologies, led by former Cisco exec Rob Lloyd and SpaceX engineer Brogan BamBrogan (yup, his legal name) want to have at least three operating Hyperloops by 2020. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, a group of engineers from various companies who donate their spare time in exchange for stock options, says it's about to build a full-scale test track in central California.\nThough Musk isn't, so far as anyone knows, deploying any significant resources to Hyperloop, SpaceX announced in June that it would sponsor the student competition because \"we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype.\" What's not entirely clear is how these designs could move from concepts\u2014even if they are working concepts\u2014to commercial application. \"The knowledge gained here will continue to be open-sourced,\" SpaceX says, so companies pursuing the technology could crib from the ideas at some point.\nWhatever the longterm play, that uncertainty didn't deter those interested. The MIT team of 25 graduate students, formed soon after the competition was announced. It started as two efforts, one focused on aerodynamics, the other on the mechanical engineering, until everyone realized they'd be better off working together.

While the Glendora High School Tartans threw their gloves in the air and dog-piled on the pitching mound, the Yucaipa Thunderbirds milled around the first-base line. Most stood with their arms folded and looked down. Others had their hands on their hips. Some gazed toward their crowd which offered respectful applause.\nCoach Jeff Stout\u2019s unseeded team had a magical playoff run that included a first-round upset of the No. 2 seed, but it came to an end with a 10-3 loss to the top-seeded Tartans in Saturday\u2019s CIF Southern Section Division 2 championship game at The Diamond.\nIt was the first title-game appearance for Glendora in the school\u2019s 59-year history. It was the fifth championship game for the Thunderbirds, who have won three titles, the last in 1994.\nThe contest was billed as a pitchers duel with UCLA-bound Adam Plutko on the mound for the Tartans (27-2-1) and Taijuan Walker going for the Thunderbirds (27-7). Both are expected to be high selections in this week\u2019s Major League free agent draft with some predicting Walker going in the first round.\nBut only one pitcher looked the part this time. Walker (10-4) surrendered five hits and five runs, although an error factored into two of those. He walked five and departed with no outs in the fourth inning and his team trailing.\nPlutko struggled in the first inning, when he gave up a single to Leonard Malfavon, who scored on a triple by Wyatt Padgett to give the Thunderbirds a 1-0 lead that was short-lived. Plutko gave up just three hits in the next six innings and was backed by an offense that totaled 12 hits off four Yucaipa pitchers.\nGlendora, the Sierra League champion, seized the lead in the second with a three-run outburst that featured run-scoring singles by Jacob Cage and Joseph Woodward and an RBI triple by Brennan Salgado.\nYucaipa got back within striking distance with a run in the fourth. Grady Espinosa tripled to left-center and scored on a groundout by Alec Morabito to cut the deficit to 3-2.\nBut the Tartans again retaliated with three runs in the bottom of the inning. Walker walked Salgado and Max Shih before being pulled from the game. A mishandled bunt scored another run and Clint Harwick followed with a two-run single off Walker\u2019s successor Pedro Cota to make it 6-2. The contest never was close again.\nPlutko set down seven consecutive hitters after Espinosa\u2019s triple in the fourth. He did give up another run in the sixth on a balk with a runner at third, but it didn\u2019t matter as the Tartans secured the game with four runs in the sixth.\nDespite the magnitude of the game, Yucaipa players said nerves were not a factor."}

Bon-Ton is one of the larger regional department store chains in the U.S. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection on Feb. 4th.\nAdam, when we actually covered department stores and their holiday results last month, you spoke briefly about Bon-Ton and how this outcome seemed pretty much inevitable at that point. How did Bon-Ton end up in this position?\nLevine-Weinberg: From a high-level perspective, Bon-Ton&apos;s historical strength was being in these rural markets, primarily smaller towns where there wasn&apos;t a lot of competition, and there weren&apos;t a lot of options for consumers to get high-quality, branded department store goods. This was great until the internet came about. All of the sudden, after you had Amazon in particular moving into the fashion market, now people can get the same kinds of goods that they had to go to Bon-Ton for previously. Now, they can get the same thing at a lower price, at least a more competitive price, from Amazon and from the retail websites of companies like Macy&apos;s. That&apos;s the big picture of what has happened.\nBon-Ton is a lot smaller than most of its competitors, it has about $2.5 billion annual revenue. That makes it about a tenth of the size of Macy&apos;s, for example."}

If you really like red, then decorate with red. If it\u2019s orange, use orange and enjoy it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to use color,\u201d said Gruber. She described a room that she just decorated with chocolate walls and lime, aqua, and cream-colored accents.\nSpice colors are also popular, she said, especially deeper, cinnamon-like shades of orange.\nYou can add a splash of color to a white apartment by painting just one wall. For smaller apartments, a darker wall color makes a room appear larger because the wall seems to recede. For larger apartments, consider using a brighter color such as lime green.\nBefore investing in paint, Lawrence suggested that you clear it with the landlord.

Indeed, for Japan, with its mega-cities, human-carved landscapes and even cemented riverbeds, it might seem ridiculous to think that wolves\u2014two species, in fact\u2014once roamed this fascinating but thoroughly modern and human-dominated landscape.\nSurely, this is the land of Pikachu and the monsters depicted in Japanese Anime, not a place where actual apex predators take down deer and the occasional human passerby? One could be forgiven for believing so, but an organization called the Japanese Wolf Alliance (JWA) aims to bring them back, most likely through importing closely-related Russian wolves, in part because the sika deer population in Hokkaido island alone has reached over a half a million and is devastating the natural balance of the ecosystem. Not even the mighty resident brown bears can do anything about the exploding sika population, which is causing tens of millions of dollars in damage to agriculture and the environment. The wolves have to come back to restore the balance.\nBrett L. Walker, author of the highly readable The Lost Wolves of Japan, explains what happened to Japan\u2019s wolves and why they were exterminated (when they were once worshipped) in a campaign of eradication: \u201cEven though Japanese worshiped wolves, they also killed them, particularly after the spread of rabies in the 18th century. In a bizarre episode unique to global wolf history, in the 18th century wolves became rabid man-killers in many parts of Japan, and wolf hunts, designed to cleanse the landscape of what many Japanese saw as demons, often looked more like ceremonies than hunts\u2026..Even as wolves killed and ate Japanese travelers in the 18th century, most Japanese still viewed wolves as deities who lived in an otherworldly space of mountains and forests, and for this reason they ceremoniously killed these demons or offered prayers to competing deities, such as the \u201cpasture deity\u201d (makigami), hoping to protect livestock from wolf predation.\u201d And for human safety, one would imagine.\nThis is a far cry from the Japan of today, with its bullet trains and cosplay and internet-addicted hikikomori, or people who deliberately shut themselves away from society, but wolves once ranged from northernmost Hokkaido Island all the way down to Kyushu Island\u2014the southernmost of the \u201cbig four\u201d Japanese islands.\nThe now near-extinct and/or completely assimilated Ainu indigenous people of Japan got along fine with wolves, but can modern Japanese do the same? It is one thing to have monkeys soaking in hot springs for tourists to photograph, but quite another for humans to live among large predators. Yet the idea of reintroducing wolves to Japan remains enticing, and in fact this highly industrialized nation boasts an impressive array of wildlife, including the Iriomote Cat (listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered) on Iriomote island in the Ryukyu archipelago between Kyushu and Taiwan, the now high-threatened dugong of Okinawa (threatened due to US military projects in the area), sea turtles, and a special form of red coral much sought after by the Chinese (which brings on Chinese poaching vessels), among many other forms of wildlife.\nOf course, Japan also recently decided to resume commercial whaling, the country smuggles"}

Now read this!\nHundreds of senior citizens and physically disabled New Yorkers are unable to use busses nor climb subway stairs. Those who can afford to pay for them may use car services or taxicabs. Many others depend upon Access-A-Ride vans, equipped with lifts for wheelchairs and walkers, to get them to doctors\u2019 appointments, physical therapy, and other needed medical services, as well as to senior centers and other clubs and organizations that provide hot meals, health care and exercise, socialization and entertainment.\nI am a senior citizen, a member of Council Center on Quentin Road in Brooklyn. I take the bus to the center, but many of my friends use Access-A-Ride. I have a friend who lives about 10 minutes away from the center, but, because of severe arthritis, has to depend upon Access-A-Ride. Twice in the last two weeks she arrived an hour late for her acting class because Access-A-Ride picked her up late. Last Thursday, after classes and lunch, she went downstairs around 3 o\u2019clock to await a promised 3:30 pick-up by Access-A-Ride to take her home. I came downstairs at 4:20, after other activities, just as the center was about to close. I was shocked to see my friend sitting outside on her walker trying to call the dispatcher to find out where her van was. First she was told it would arrive in 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes. Every other member had left or been picked up. The only one there was an employee who has to stay until every member has gone safely home. My friend\u2019s van finally showed up at 4:50. By then, she was crying and wondering if she should come back to the center anymore or just give up and stay confined to her house.\nI don\u2019t know if there is a shortage of drivers or vans or both. I do know that many of the drivers just don\u2019t know their way around. I have ridden with friends and seen drivers get hopelessly lost in Brooklyn or Manhattan. Many vans are now equipped with Global Positioning Devices, but the drivers don\u2019t know how to use them. Many dispatchers, the people who plan the drivers\u2019 routes, don\u2019t seem to know the streets in Brooklyn or Manhattan and have drivers picking up and dropping off passengers at disparate locations that severely lengthen the amount of time riders spend on the van, and cause the drivers to frequently be late for their pick-ups and passengers to be late for doctor\u2019s appointments and classes. There are probably enough passengers living near each other in Brooklyn to fill a van rapidly without making a van operator drive his passengers all over Brooklyn or Manhattan.\nI would like to suggest that every dispatcher and driver be given extensive training in getting around in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and in reading and understanding the GPS. Also, every dispatcher should know, at all times, where every driver and van is located. Extra vans and drivers should be on call in case a driver is running very late for a pick-up. I do not believe that anybody should have to wait an hour-and-a -half for an Access-A-Ride pick-up, nor that anybody should be forced to stay home because he or she can\u2019t get the transportation they are entitled to and desperately need.\nIn response to Allen Rosen, you seem to have left out the Fire Department and educators as well, who also on the surface may seem to take liberties with parking.

{"idx": "22902", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Civilization VI embraces DirectX 12's async compute and explicit multi-adapter.\nWhen Firaxis launched the underrated Civilization: Beyond Earth two years ago, the game served as a showcase for what was possible using AMD\u2019s revolutionary \u201cclose to the metal\u201d Mantle API, featuring unorthodox \u201csplit frame rendering\u201d to deliver extraordinary smoothness in systems with multiple Radeon graphics cards. Two years later, Mantle is dead, subsumed by Vulkan and rivaled by Microsoft\u2019s own DirectX 12.\nBut the close ties between AMD and Firaxis is not.\nWednesday morning, the two companies revealed that they\u2019ve partnered up yet again to bake DirectX12 support into the hotly anticipated Civilization VI. Split frame rendering won\u2019t be returning, sadly, but the game will feature a pair of DX12 highlight features: Explicit multi-adapter and asynchronous compute.\nThe story behind the story: Early DirectX 12 benchmarks tend to show massive performance gains on Radeon graphics cards. That goes doubly so in games that lean heavily on compute-based tasks, which can take particular advantage of the asynchronous compute engine (or asynchronous shader) hardware built into AMD\u2019s GPU architecture. So it\u2019s no surprise to see AMD take so many strategy games under its wing, with the company helping to integrate DX12 into Ashes of the Singularity ($45 on Steam), Total War: Warhammer ($60 on Steam), and now Civilization VI.\nAsynchronous compute allows graphics processors to run compute and graphics rendering tasks simultaneously, rather waiting for one task to finish before performing another. Asynchronous compute makes graphics cards more effective, which in turn should result in improved performance, especially on Radeon graphics cards. Ashes of the Singularity, Total War: Warhammer, Hitman, and Rise of the Tomb Raider (thanks to a just-released patch) are some of the other big-name PC games that support asynchronous compute.\nExplicit multi-adapter is the more intriguing feature, as the only other major game that supports it is Ashes of the Singularity, a damn fine real-time strategy game and DX12\u2019s brightest star thus far. DirectX 12 offers a few different ways for developers to support systems with multiple GPUs, and explicit multi-adapter is the most impressive.\nThe black magic possible with DX12\u2019s explicit multi-adapter.\nWith it, two similar graphics cards inside a system can be treated as a single piece of hardware, pooling resources together in \u201clinked\u201d EMA. Alternatively, explicit multi-adapter can also allow you to tap into two totally different \u201cunlinked\u201d GPUs entirely\u2014running AMD and Nvidia cards together, for example, or tapping into your CPU\u2019s integrated graphics to handle secondary tasks while your main card handles the main load. We\u2019ve asked whether the game will support both modes, or just linked EMA.\nCool stuff indeed. Civilization VI ($60 preorder on Steam) launches on October 21, and you\u2019ll need Windows 10 to take advantage of the DirectX 12 features. Watch out for Gandhi."}

Magister cited a comment made by Vienna archbishop Cardinal Christoph Schonborn in April, which suggested that the topic of women's ordination could be considered in an ecumenical council.\nThough Magister seems firm in the idea that the \u201cofficial ministry\u201d to be addressed at the synod on the Amazon will include the diaconate, the text is not specific about what ministries might include women, making it difficult to determine what sort of roles the synod council has in mind.\nAmong the Church\u2019s official roles which are likely to be up for discussion during the 2019 meeting are the \u201cministries\u201d of the lector and acolyte, which are presently open only to men.\nAt a June 8 press briefing announcing the working document, which is entitled \u201cAmazonia: New Paths for the Church and for an Integral Ecology,\u201d Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri, secretary general of the Vatican office of the Synod of Bishops, avoided giving a clear answer to the question of the women participating in some kind of \u201cdiaconal\u201d ministry, but offered a clear \u201cno\u201d to women's priestly ordination.\nIn the 1994 text Ordinatio sacerdotalis, Pope St John Paul II authoritatively declared \u201cthat the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women,\u201d saying that priestly ordination \u201cfrom the beginning always been reserved to men alone.\u201d The document did not explicitly mention deacons.\nBuzz about the possibility of ordaining women as deacons first flared up in 2016, when Pope Francis established a Study Commission on the Women's Diaconate, naming current Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Luis Ladaria, as head of the 12-member group.\nSince his appointment to the commission Ladaria has been mostly silent on the issue. However, in comments to the press June 26, the prelate said the group's job is not to determine whether or not women can be made deacons, but to study what was done in the past.\nAmong the questions studied by the committee are what roles early Churchwomen played as \u201cdeaconesses,\u201d and whether the Church understood their commissioning for that role to be equivalent to sacramental ordination.\nLadaria"}

We need shared vision to inspire hope, incorporate the seeds of the future in the present and illuminate a path to where we want to wind up. Here is a summary of a longer essay, \u201cTaking Up The Task,\u201d available on the ZNet website.\nOur goal ought to be a classless economy. In such an economy, everyone would be equally able to participate, utilize their capacities and accrue income. Private ownership of productive assets must be gone, but so too must a division of labor that affords some producers far greater influence and income than others.\nBy their position in the economy, lawyers, doctors, engineers, managers, etc., accrue information, skills, confidence, energy and influence on daily outcomes sufficient to largely control their own tasks and those of workers below. These \u201ccoordinator class\u201d members operate subordinate to capital but above workers.\n\u201cOut with the old boss, in with the new boss\u201d is not a strategy that ends bosses. To retain the distinction between the coordinator class and the working class would ensure coordinator class rule. Our movements and projects must eliminate the monopoly of capitalists on productive property but also the monopoly of coordinators on empowering work. Indeed, this is what reimagining socialism is primarily about.\nBeyond classlessness, we also ought to seek equity, solidarity, diversity, self-management, ecological balance and economic efficiency.\nFor moral and economic reasons, each person who is able to work should be remunerated for the duration, intensity and onerousness of their socially valued effort.\nEconomic relations should produce a social partnership of mutual aid, rather than people fleecing one another in an antisocial shootout. Each person should enjoy a self-managing say over the decisions that affect them.\nAn economy should not compel us to destroy our natural habitat but should instead reveal the full and true social and ecological costs and benefits of contending choices, and convey to us control over the options.\nClearly, private ownership of productive property, corporate divisions of labor, top-down decision-making, markets and central planning violate all these aspirations.\nFor workers and consumers to influence decisions in proportion to the degree they are affected by them requires self-managing councils through which they can express and tally their preferences.\nEquitable distribution requires that workers be remunerated for the duration and intensity of their effort and the harshness of conditions. Remunerated effort must also be socially useful so that workers have incentives that elicit fulfilling output.\nSelf-managed decisions require confident preparation, relevant capacity and appropriate participation. There can\u2019t be some actors who monopolize empowering work while others are left disempowered and unable to manifest a will of their own. Balancing jobs for empowerment eliminates the division between coordinators and workers by ensuring all workers are enabled to participate fully in self-management.\nAllocation should be determined by cooperative and informed negotiation in which all of people\u2019s freely expressed wills are proportionately actualized and in which operations, mindsets and structures further the logic of self-managing councils, balanced job complexes and equitable remuneration rather than violating each. To my thinking, this implies what has been called participatory planning.\nStrategically, just as movements should foreshadow a future that is feminist and polycultural, so should movements foreshadow a future that is self-managing and classless, including incorporating the elements of participatory economics mentioned above.\nSeeking transformed economic institutions requires that we begin to create such institutions in the present but also that we fight for changes in capitalist institutions.

But when a shock like demonetisation occurs, that primarily affects the informal sector, relying on formal indicators to measure overall activity will overstate GDP. This hypothesis goes only a small way towards explaining the puzzle since any squeeze in informal sector incomes would depress demand in the formal sector, and this effect should have been sizeable.\nOne answer to the demonetisation puzzle has been that the poor were willing to overlook their own hardships, knowing that the rich and their ill-begotten wealth were experiencing even greater hardship: \u201cI lost a goat, but they lost their cows\u201d, he says. In this view, the costs to the poor were unavoidable collateral damage that had to be incurred for attaining a larger goal.\n\u201cUnderstanding the political economy of demonetisation may require us, therefore, to confront one overlooked possibility \u2014 that adversely impacting the many, far from being a bug, could perhaps have been a feature of the policy action."}

I, myself, own a PS3 but no Xbox 360, I like my PS3, and it\u2019s game library, but the 360 has much to offer, and despite the Xbox being more popular on the market, I\u2019m glad I chose my PS3 over the 360.

Additional growth this year and next has been accommodate with portables. The district expects middle-school enrollment to stabilize in the next two years as the current smaller fourth- and fifth-grade classes move forward.\nAs promised by district leadership, the enrollment report includes an update on not only average class sizes at the secondary schools, but also minimums, maximums and numbers of sections for individual courses at each school.\nAccording to a staff report prepared by Chief Student Services Office Holly Wade, middle-school classes are \"hitting most of the target class sizes\" in the core subject areas of English, history/social studies, mathematics and science, as well as world language.\nUnder the district\u2019s adopted student-teacher ratios, all sixth-grade core classes and all seventh- and eighth-grade math and English classes should have 24 students.\nCurrently, 6 percent of all middle-school sections have 30 or more students in them, according to the enrollment report.\n\"While some of these classes at or over 30 were unavoidable due to limited sections and strong registration rates, there are a few areas that could be balanced to decrease this percentage to even less than 6%,\" Wade wrote.\nAt Palo Alto and Gunn high schools, enrollment is down slightly, by 33 students, but is expected to grow as the large middle-school \"bubble\" classes arrive in the next few years.

But that\u2019s a significant improvement from the 16.6 per cent decline in new listings in January which was blamed, along with the unrelenting polar vortex, for a 2.2 per cent drop in sales across the GTA.\nRealtors say they are seeing more folks looking to list, but at the same time a lot of pent-up demand which has played out the last few weeks in almost irrational bidding wars, including 32 offers on a Perth Ave. house that went for $210,000 over the $639,900 asking price.\nSales of detached homes were down 0.2 per cent across the GTA (they dropped 12.4 per cent in the City of Toronto), in large part a reflection of the lack of houses available to buy, but prices were up 10.9 per cent.\nDetached homes in the City of Toronto sold for an average of $942,066 as of mid month, up 15.2 per cent year over year, while they averaged $634,146 in the 905 regions, up 10.2 per cent, according to TREB.\nSemi-detached sales flatlined across the GTA, but sank by 23.6 per cent in the City of Toronto, again, largely reflecting the lack of listings for what has become, due to sky-high detached housing prices, some of the most in-demand housing stock across the GTA.\nThe average sale price of semi was $685,111 across the 416 region as of mid month, up 9.6 per cent, while they averaged $419,972 in the 905 regions, up 4.7 per cent year over year.\nTownhouse sales were down 9 per cent across the GTA but prices were up 27.4 per cent in the 416 region, to an average $568,894.

Nor may courts assume (and I do not assume) that an unworthy purpose prompts a congressional act,\" Orrick wrote in his order (posted here). \"And, importantly in our Constitutional system, there are three equal branches of government, and courts should refrain from creating needless friction with a coordinate branch of government.\"\nThe videos in dispute are part of a broader set of videos that have prompted national controversy and led to Republican calls for the defunding of Planned Parenthood. The footage already made public shows doctors and other clinic personnel discussing details of fetal tissue donation practices while dining at restaurants.\nActing on a request from the National Abortion Federation, Orrick issued a temporary restraining order against publication of videos taken at the organization's conventions as well as those depicting members of the group. The judge said there's evidence that the video makers signed non-disclosure agreements saying they would not make such images or information public.\nThe National Abortion Federation argued that Daleiden would be violating the order if he handed over the videos and that the subpoena was unenforceable at least for now, but the judge said it was permissible for the activist to comply.\n\"NAF does not argue that the information sought by the subpoena falls outside the 'sphere of legitimate legislative activity' of the House Committee. ... Absent an attempt to exceed that sphere, the Speech and Debate Clause provides immunity to allow Congress to independently perform its legislative duties through its subpoena powers,\" Orrick wrote. \"As explained by the Supreme Court, it is not the Court\u2019s role to determine the legitimacy of the Congressional investigation by looking to the Committee\u2019s motives.\"\nOrrick said he remains concerned about the privacy and safety of NAF members but can't assume that Congress will release the videos just because it has subpoenaed them.\n\"The 'court cannot assume that Congress will act irresponsibly in regulating or disclosing' the information at issue,\" he wrote.\nIn a statement late Tuesday, the National Abortion Federation pointed to a part of Orrick's order that requires Daleiden to give NAF copies of everything being turned over to Congress before it is handed over.\n\"We do not believe that all of the footage CMP stole from our meetings is responsive to this subpoena, and we urge the Committee to require Daleiden to also turn over all documents and emails relevant to the conspiracy and fraud he committed against NAF and our members,\u201d said NAF President and CEO Vicki Saporta. \"We urge Congress to be mindful of the security risks faced by abortion providers, and the need for confidentiality as they conduct their investigation.\"\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Daleiden praised the judge's ruling.\n\u201cThe National Abortion Federation has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep David Daleiden\u2019s footage of its annual meetings out of the hands of law enforcement"}

This will be the first time they are picking their president. The election is wide open, pitting Islamists against men who served under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak. The contest is a novelty for a nation where elections during the 30-year rule of a man some called \"Pharaoh\" were thinly attended rigmaroles in which the result was a foregone conclusion. This time Egypt's 50 million eligible voters are expected to turn out in force to determine who will lead the country after the generals, who have overseen a transition marred by violence, protests and political deadlock, formally hand over power by July 1. With none of the 12 candidates expected to secure more than half the votes to win outright in the first round on Wednesday and Thursday, a run-off between the top two is likely in June.

That is likely to fill fuel and oxidizer tanks, in preparation for what North Korea says is the launch of an Earth observation satellite but which the U.S. calls a ballistic missile test.\nNorth Korea this week announced the launch would take place between Feb. 8 and 25. It would follow the government's announcement of a purported hydrogen bomb test last month that has deepened international concern over its progress toward having a nuclear bomb that can be mounted on a long-range missile.\nPresident Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone Friday and agreed that the launch would be another \"provocative and destabilizing\" action in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, a White House statement said.\nThey reaffirmed their refusal to accept a nuclear-armed North Korea, as well as to the \"complete and verifiable\" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The leaders also emphasized the need for a united international response to North Korea's actions, including through the U.N. Security Council, the statement said.\nBut the U.S. has appeared more eager than China, the North's only ally and its main source of economic support, to crank up sanctions.\nChinese state news agency Xinhua, in its dispatch about the call between the two leaders, said Xi stressed that the current situation on the peninsula is \"complicated and sensitive.\"\nA North Korean launch is considered a violation of U.N. sanctions as similar technology can be used for ballistic missiles.\nThe North Korea-focused website, 38 North, said in an analysis the evidence from satellite imagery taken on Wednesday and Thursday doesn't mean the North has starting filling a rocket with fuel, but is probably taking a preparatory step. It says that in the past, such activity has happened one to two weeks before blastoff.\nThe website said it is not yet clear if a rocket is on the launch pad.\nBut there's been continuing activity this week at a building at Sohae, the analysis said. In the past, the site has been used to assemble the sections of a rocket in a horizontal position and test the connections before shifting them to mount vertically at the launch pad.\nIt was from Sohae that North Korea blasted a rocket into space for the first time in 2012, mounted with a satellite that experts say malfunctioned soon after it entered orbit."}

{"idx": "22930", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: After writing an editorial suggesting that President Obama should appoint another Catholic to the Supreme Court, many have questioned the sanity with which that statement was made. Well, it was made in order to inspire the faithful Catholics of the United States to make their voices known loudly and clearly regarding their desires to have another Catholic appointed to the nation\u2019s highest court. Intrinsically, the rule of Constitutional law does not stipulate what faith the Wise Nine should hold in order to preside over the Supreme Court. We are actually blessed with five sitting Supreme Court Justices that are Catholic. It would be ideologically insane to believe that the President would appoint another Catholic to replace Associate Justice Scalia simply because currently presidential favor towards another Catholic Associate Justice is indeed highly unlikely.\nHowever, the Constitutional rule of law is incumbent that the President appoint a replacement to fill the vacant seat created by the death of Justice Scalia. Regardless of the political conflagration currently happening in Washington, D.C. and around the nation President Obama has the responsibility and obligation to fulfill his obligations to the Constitution, for this he should not be criticized. Whether the Senate indeed confirms the nominee, yet to be put forward is another matter entirely. Once again, the Constitution provides the procedural rule of law for ratification of a nominee to the Supreme Court. If the deliberations of the United States Senate procrastinate in their obligation for whatever the reasons until after the presidential election in November, such is their responsibility.\nIndeed, perhaps the next President of the United States will have the rare and coveted opportunity to reconfigure the Supreme Court according to the political inclinations of the nation only revealed in November. Suspicion indicates this is unlikely and indicates a lack of prudence on the part of the United States Senate, considering some of their seats are up for grabs!\nThe unfolding of the Supreme Court saga is still at the nascent stage and it is really too early in the first trimester to make a prognostication of a safe delivery of an Associate Justice within a reasonable amount of time. Once again, the document that guides the navigation, the Constitution does not stipulate the time frame within which the nomination of an Associate Justice, the Senate\u2019s procedural process or the ratification of the proposed nominee should take place. Due diligence is at work and that is indeed one of the hallmarks of our American Republic and our system of legislative and juridical procedures. Hopefully, an amicable appointment of a properly vetted candidate with keen legal potentiality will be proposed by President Obama.\nRegarding the role Catholics play in this process of supplementing the Supreme Court\u2019s current vacancy is to lobby their senatorial representatives. Catholic voters are a formidable block of the popular vote in the United States, and the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government should recognize the potential strength of the Catholic vote. Any competent group of Catholics that do not recognize or realize this potentiality of the Catholic ballot should be considered for a psychological examination. After stating this, despite their timidity to make any statements regarding critical issues on politics, the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops need to, as is commonly said, \u201cMan up!\u201d Many decisions before the Supreme Court need further examination and perhaps overturning\u2026need we mention again and again, Roe v Wade!

Here\u2019s a look at those deals and each player\u2019s likely future impact on the Hawks.\nNov. 25: Forwards Dylan Strome and Brendan Perlini acquired from the Coyotes for Nick Schmaltz.\nStrome: The No. 3 pick in the 2015 draft had an immediate impact on the Hawks, quickly establishing himself as a core player. He has 32 points in 35 games and is a key part of the revamped power play. Letting him get away could prove to be a major embarrassment to the Coyotes.\nThe 21-year-old forward has one year left on his entry-level deal.\nPerlini: The England native has provided hints that he can become a productive NHL player, but so far he has alternated between a bottom-six forward and a healthy scratch. Perlini had 31 goals during his first two seasons with the Coyotes but got off to a slow start with two goals in 22 games before coming to the Hawks.\nIn 28 games since the trade, Perlini has three goals and one assist. He will be a restricted free agent after this season and should return.\nDec. 30: Forward Drake Caggiula and Jason Garrison acquired from the Oilers for Brandon Manning and Robin Norell.\nBowman signed Manning to a two-year, $4.5 million deal this summer, but the free agent was a bust with the Hawks. He was a healthy scratch for the first time barely two weeks into the season and by mid-December was no longer playing. Bowman found a taker in the Oilers, who inexplicably gave up a bona fide NHL player in Caggiula.\nSince arriving, Caggiula has three goals and three assists in 16 games and in mid-January joined Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews on the top line. His aggressive play and surprisingly deft skills are a perfect match for the Hawks\u2019 stars. Kane and Toews eventually will be separated, so it\u2019s tough to say where Caggiula will end up. But so far he\u2019s looking like a steal.\nCaggiula\u2019s contract runs through next season with a $1.5 million cap hit.\nJan. 11: Defenseman Slater Koekkoek and a fifth-round pick acquired from the Lightning for Jan Rutta and a seventh-round pick.\nRutta, a right-handed shot, was in Rockford after losing his spot in the Hawks\u2019 rotation. The Lightning are loaded on defense and had no room for Koekkoek, a left-handed shot, who was in the AHL on a conditioning stint when the Hawks acquired him.\nKoekkoek has one assist in eight games while averaging 16 minutes, 25 seconds of ice time.

{"idx": "22941", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: At the 2014 Olympics where he won the silver medal in slopestyle skiing, Gus Kenworthy toyed with the idea of finishing up one of his runs by skiing up to the crowd of spectators and kissing his boyfriend. It would have been a dramatic way for Kenworthy to become the first openly gay male from the U.S. in Winter Olympics history. But Kenworthy wasn\u2019t out, back then, to his parents and siblings. He decided it\u2019d be too much, too soon.\nInstead, he came out to his inner circle, and then to the world with a 2015 ESPN The Magazine story. He\u2019s arrived now at the Pyeongchang Olympics as one of a pair of history-making gay competitors. His counterpart is Adam Rippon, the 28-year-old figure skater who, within days of the games\u2019 commencement, became a media sensation thanks both to his precisely pretty skate style as well as his quick, cutting, and decidedly queer wit. Rippon and Kenworthy are among 14 openly LGBT athletes from around the world at Pyeongchang\u2014the highest number for any Winter Olympics ever. The results, so far, have been a crash course in gay aesthetics, politics, and personalities. Openness, viewers have been reminded, can make great TV\u2014and a great difference in lives.\nAt the outset of these games, the average spectator might not have guessed there were many significant \u201cfirsts\u201d left for gay people at the Olympics. The SNL gag ahead of Sochi was that the Olympics would have to strain to find straight male figure skaters to compete in repressive Russia. Brian Boitano and Johnny Weir, two of the biggest stars of the Winter Olympics\u2019 signature sport, skated during their heydays from inside a glass closet filled with fox furs and sequins. The past three Summer games featured the British diver Tom Daley, one of the BuzzFeed generation\u2019s gay pinups. And out lesbians have been part of a few U.S. Olympic delegations without much media fuss, a trend that continues this year with the outsized focus on Rippon and Kenworthy over speed skater Brittany Bowe.\nBut when it comes to the Olympics and sexuality, one dominant dynamic has been lurid, prying interest from the public\u2014and careful discretion from athletes. Take for example the scandal of the 2016 Daily Beast story, in which a straight reporter catfished a number of athletes on Grindr, some from notoriously homophobic countries (the publication retracted the piece after outcry). The 2004 Summer games represented the last time the U.S. sent an out gay man to compete; that man, the dressage rider Robert Dover, has noted that many more queer people contend for medals than the public knows.\nThe fact that sports is a realm of rules-following is never far from mind when watching the Olympics. This extends even to the interviews and color pieces with competitors, in which the incentive not to ruffle judges or sponsors\u2014plus the intense focus required for high-level performance\u2014can stilt the dialogue. We all know the interview script: the runners-up hiding their disappointment as they talk up their training routines; the medalists dutifully crediting coaches and family.\nNow, the similarly sparkly Rippon need not speak in code at all, though he can when he wants. His charm reflects a particular set of truths: Being gay can force someone into hyperawareness of how they\u2019re perceived, and being out can make them care less"}

New holiday pay rules require businesses to pay employees on statutory holidays regardless of how long they\u2019ve worked at the company, and even when it\u2019s not their regular workday. The government also raised the carbon tax to $30 a tonne in 2018, up from $20 a tonne, which has led to higher fuel costs.\nThe government reduced the small-business corporate income tax rate to 2 per cent from 3 per cent in 2017 to help businesses adjust to the carbon levy, but many say it\u2019s not enough, particularly given the province\u2019s continuing economic downturn.\nMr. Batke says he plans to vote for the UCP based on promises to stimulate the economy.

The review is ongoing and there has been no finding or allegation of wrongdoing.\nTCHC spokesman Bruce Malloch, who has repeatedly spoken for Milsom since the Toronto Sun first broke the story on Nov. 22, refused to name the second employee placed on administrative leave.\nBut sources indicate it is Andrew McKenzie, newly promoted director of service integration and delivery, who sat on the team with Milsom in March which selected Orchango (McKenzie is also Councillor Michael Thompson\u2019s half-brother).\nHe said it is part of a prudent effort to \u201cisolate those responsible for the procurement\u201d from the third-party review.\nAs revealed by the Toronto Sun in late November, Mellina \u2014 a self-described leader in \u201cnimble change management for the age of disruption\u201d \u2014 was selected from six other would-be proponents in a public RFP even though his bid was 28% higher than the housing authority\u2019s own estimates for the job.\nAccording to a six-page confidential March 27 vendor award committee report \u2014 obtained by the Sun \u2014 Orchango\u2019s submission was the only one of the seven firms to qualify for the job. The report shows that Milsom was part of the team that evaluated the seven RFPs, along with McKenzie.\nA second confidential report shows Orchango\u2019s RFP price was three times higher than that documented in November 2017 when Milsom initially hired Millena (two months after she came on board) as a sole-source supplier. It remains unclear why his sole-sourced contract was altered to a competitive bid.\nThe Sun also revealed that a similar \u201cchange management contract\u201d \u2014 with virtually the same buzzwords \u2014 was handed to Orchango\u2019s Millena while Milsom was CEO of the provincially-funded Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA).

I'm not going to limit myself in voice-overs to irascible old men.\n\"You better get that straight!\" Asner adds, slyly slipping into the crabby tone he perfected as Grant, the role that won him five of his seven Emmys, first on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and later in the spinoff \"Lou Grant.\"\nAsner does not want to limit himself because Hollywood has done that for him through the years. He said he had only one year in his 50-plus-year career that he landed as much work as he wanted, when he was working on Moore's sitcom and shot 1976's \"Rich Man, Poor Man,\" a miniseries that also won him an Emmy.\nTurning 80 this November, Asner still wishes more offers would come his way. Asked how often he receives scripts that really interest him, he inquired, \"Did you bring anything with you?\"\n\"No, nothing comes in,\" Asner said. \"I'm not sought-after. I never get enough work. It's the history of my career. There just isn't anything to turn down, let me put it that way.\"\nAsner was sought-after for the role of Carl Fredricksen in \"Up,\" the latest tale from Pixar and its parent outfit, Walt Disney, whose animated hits include \"WALL-E,\" \"Ratatouille,\" \"Finding Nemo\" and the \"Toy Story\" flicks. The film opened Friday.\n\"Up\" director Pete Docter said Asner was Pixar's first choice for the voice of Carl, a lonely, cranky widower who renews his spirit of adventure by tying thousands of helium balloons to his house and flying off to the wilds of South America.\nDocter said the Pixar animators often zero in on voices by putting on old movies and TV shows with the picture off, listening only to the audio to see who might fit the characters they're developing. Asner's Lou Grant was an icon of the bullying but lovable boss, Docter said.\n\"Ed, he has the comedic chops, he's got the acting chops, and he's made a career of playing these types of characters,\" Docter said. \"He's sort of coursing through our entertainment DNA.\"\nAsner made good use of his prickly persona as a world-weary Santa Claus in Will Ferrell's 2003 hit \"Elf.\" His other big-screen credits include \"JFK\" and \"Fort Apache the Bronx,\" while his many TV guest spots include \"ER,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"The X-Files.\" Asner also has done a great deal of TV voice-over work for such shows as \"The Simpsons\" and \"Spider-Man.\"\nHe recently got the call to do more voice work for the animated series \"The Boondocks,\" on which he has a recurring character.

{"idx": "22960", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Los Angeles Lakers are working on a trade to acquire center Roy Hibbert from the Indiana Pacers, reports ESPN\u2019s Marc Stein and Ramona Shelburne. The parameters of the trade haven\u2019t been finalized, but the Lakers will likely absorb Hibbert into their cap space while sending draft picks in return.\nThis is a fairly reasonable gamble for Los Angeles. Hibbert is still one of the best rim protectors in the league. Teams not only shoot poorly at the rim when Hibbert is in the game, often times they avoid the paint altogether. However, what Hibbert gives on the defensive end, he takes away on the offensive side of the ball. Outside of pounding a small Heat team in the playoffs, Hibbert has never shown himself to be a consistent offensive threat. It\u2019s hard to imagine Hibbert running up and down and keeping pace with some of the fast teams in the West. Will he have a place on the court against the likes of San Antonio, Houston and Golden State? That being said, his contract expires after this upcoming season, so L.A. is wise to soak up his defense for a year before trying their hand at free agency again in 2016.\nThe Pacers have been trying to get rid of Hibbert for some time. Larry Bird practically begged him to opt out of the last year of his deal, citing Indiana\u2019s preference to play a new style of basketball. It\u2019s an interesting time of transition for the Pacers. Their identity as a smashmouth, play-two-traditional-bigs team is over. The longtime starting frontcourt of Hibbert and Daivd West is no longer, with West also leaving the team this summer. And now Paul George will team up with Monta Ellis on the wing. Frank Vogel proved himself to be a hell of a coach last season, when he guided a mostly George-less squad into playoff contention for most of the year. But the roster that made LeBron James sweat in the playoffs year after year is no longer, and it may be a while before Indiana approaches that level of play again.\nIt\u2019s another offseason where Los Angeles will leave mostly empty handed. They were spurned by LaMarcus Aldridge, and as of now don\u2019t seem to be in serious talks to nab Boogie Cousins or another big star. It\u2019s very easy to pile on the Lakers right now for seemingly scaring away every talented player with silly presentations, but next summer, with Kobe\u2019s deal off the books, it could take just one or two signings to make Los Angeles a threat in the West once again."}

If Romney could produce a five-point swing, he would win the region by roughly 10,000 votes.\nAccording to the same survey cited in the linked article, another big factor which is lifting Romney\u2019s prospects in these counties is a decided downturn in enthusiasm from younger voters, 18-29.

We call these things off all the time. But Rachel went ahead and met Green and Bradshaw and that ultimately lead to her murder.\"\nTallahassee police were joined by the Florida State Department of Law Enforcement and sheriff's offices in four counties. They recovered her car about 30 miles south of Tallahassee and then, with tips from the community, tracked down Bradshaw and Green near Orlando.\nThe two were arrested without incident and charged with kidnapping and armed robbery. After interviews with investigators from Tallahassee, the pair reportedly led authorities to Hoffman's body. They remain behind bars at the Leon County Jail and are expected to face additional murder charges in Hoffman's death.\nMcCranie declined to say exactly when and how Hoffman was killed, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.\nHoffman, meanwhile, was buried this afternoon after a funeral service at a synagogue. In a family statement released to the media, she was described as a recent college graduate from Florida State University who planned to attend culinary school and lived her life by the words of the Beatles' song \"All You Need Is Love.\"\nBut it has been descriptions of Hoffman by Tallahassee police, as well as a reluctance to answer certain questions, that have left her family heartbroken and have riled defense attorney Johnny Devine.\n\"We've been asking questions since the get-go as to what happened that night and the Tallahassee Police Department is trying to point the arrow in every other direction,\" he said. \"They took a defensive step from the start.\"\nAuthorities began the process Friday of explaining how Hoffman became a police informant, a relationship initiated when police executed a search warrant at her apartment April 17 and recovered more than 200 grams of marijuana as well as ecstasy.\nHoffman was already part of a drug court program after a 2007 traffic stop in which police found enough marijuana to arrest her.\nAs police wrote up the probable cause affidavit, McCranie said, an officer offered Hoffman, whom he described as \"very bright\" and \"very talented,\" a chance to potentially reduce the punishment for the new drug case against her by acting as an informant.\nIt's a deal"}

In 2017 the quest was down to just one entrant by the time the festival rolled around so to have seven entrants ready to take on the task and vie for the ambassador title must mean the committee is doing something right.

She says in today's story on page two that the quest is getting a lot of interest and this is probably because the opportunities it offers entrants are unrivaled. Hopefully the increase in interest in the quest translates to an increase of support for the festival across the board which does seem like it might be the case.

With a torch light, no-slip grips, and a dust-proof case, the little phone was made for the new growth regions.\nNokia said on Thursday that the entry-level 1100 and its heirs had surpassed the 200 million-unit milestone. It also unveiled seven new models, all priced below 100 euros ($136), to seek to emulate their success.\nIn the consumer electronic charts, Apple\u2019s iPod reached the 100 million mark last month, Sony\u2019s PlayStation 2 had sold 115 million by end-2006 and Nokia\u2019s earlier top seller, the 3310/3330, sold 126 million units up to its retirement in 2005.\nIn 2002, the industry was still suffering a dot-com hangover, with sales in developed markets falling for a second straight year. Emerging markets, however, were taking off.\nAnnual handset sales in developing markets have grown more than three times since 2002, compared to just 62 percent growth in developed ones, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston, adding that 65 percent of all handsets made this year will be sold in emerging markets.\nNokia says with growing wealth lifting emerging market demand for high-end phones, its early forays in these regions are yielding benefits beyond the entry-level segment. India and Russia are now among Nokia\u2019s largest high-end phone markets.\n\u201cWe have evidence that people who have got their first Nokia, they stay with Nokia,\u201d said Soren Petersen, head of entry business at Nokia\u2019s mobile phones unit.\nThe 1100 and its followers \u2014 1101, 1108, 1110, 1110i, 1112 \u2014 have crept to the top of sales charts around the world without attracting much media attention.\nWith sales of more than a million phones a week, the 1100\u2019s volumes are comparable to all the phones made by the world\u2019s fifth-largest vendor, LG Electronics, and not far behind Sony Ericsson, the fourth-largest player in the industry.\n\u201cSuch big sales of one product family creates efficiencies which others can hardly match,\u201d said Kai Oistamo, head of Nokia\u2019s Mobile Phones unit, citing bargaining power on component prices and cost savings in production, logistics and sales.\nNokia has kept manufacturing, distribution, supply line management and development of most of its products in-house, outsourcing just 23 percent of its total production in 2006.\nManagers say the control of the business chain is key in the fast-growing low-end handset market since it is too costly to outsource viably on entry-level phones.\nNokia\u2019s closest rival, Motorola, has farmed out 41 percent of phone-making and Sony Ericsson 66 percent, according to market research firm iSuppl"}

And yet somehow the skies seem less gray in Bo-Kaap, where clusters of rowhouses snaking up the slopes of Signal Hill explode in a rainbow of gold, lavender and periwinkle.\nAlso known as the Cape Malay Quarter, the Bo-Kaap neighborhood is home to Cape Town\u2019s Muslim community. And the food being cooked in the kitchens of these houses is no less colorful than the facades.\nThe Cape Malays are descendants of political prisoners and slaves brought to the former Dutch colony from Southeast Asia in the late 1600s. As soon as I try my first koesister \u2014 a cloyingly sweet, syrupy doughnut dusted with coconut, with flavors redolent of both the Far East and the far north \u2014 I know that I\u2019m due for a history lesson.\nWhat she found was a cuisine steeped in legend. The first Europeans to land on the Cape were the Portuguese; though they didn\u2019t last, their fishing techniques did. When the Dutch first arrived, they relied heavily on the local San people\u2019s expertise with indigenous plants. But after they wiped that community out, they imported slaves from colonies in Malaysia and Indonesia.\nEventually, the English, Indians, French and Germans brought their own influences with their curries, sauces and sausages. And now, \u201crecipes that are 200 years old are still cooked in exactly the same way in Cape Malay homes,\u201d Abrahams says.\nNot far from Bo-Kaap is Cape Quarter, a complex of chic boutiques, galleries and coffee shops, popular among Cape Town\u2019s stylish set. Here, in a cobbled piazza, I find the Cape Malay Food Market, a cheerful, homey restaurant run by Zaida Tofie, a former transportation planner turned restaurateur. Most Cape Malay eateries tend to be no-frills takeaway joints dotting the less shiny parts of town, dishing up fast-food steak salomies (curried beef in a flaky roti), which makes Tofie\u2019s cafe an anomaly.\nHere I sample bobotie \u2014 a crisp egg custard, burned much like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, concealing braised beef subtly flavored with turmeric and bay leaves \u2014 and a tomato bredie, a classic comfort dish, a nourishing lamb and tomato stew that you sop up with a flaky, buttery roti. The denning vleis is like nothing I\u2019ve ever eaten before, soft stewed sweet lamb infused with tamarind. The samosas and dhaltjies are reminiscent of India. \u201cIf you eat Cape Malay food, you get to a point where when you eat other food, it tastes bland,\u201d Tofie says.\nTwenty minutes and a world away from Bo-Kaap and Cape Quarter lies Constantia, a leafy suburb and the oldest wine region in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, at the gracious Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux spread Cellars-Hohenort, executive chef Martha Williams elevates the tomato bredie to a form of fine dining.

Despite a constantly changing local demographic which has brought an influx of international business, he says 85 percent of his regular visitors are still German. What attracts them to the Fiddlers in such large numbers? In a word, the \"authenticity\" of the place.\nI am Bonn's original Irish publican and have been running Fiddlers Irish Pub in the beautiful neighbourhood of Endenich, in the heart of the city's Kulturmeile, for 15 years. I rent the premises and have lived there for the past 13 years with my German partner Marianne Michels, who has taught me German and helps me understand German laws and regulations.\nWhat brought you to Germany and how did you land your job?\nI started off working as a chef in Essen, in an Irish pub called the Fritzpatricks.\nAfter six months the owner and I decided to set up our own pub in Bonn. He later left and opened another pub, and we went our separate ways. I ended up the sole landlord of this place.\nWhat are the key differences in being a pub owner here and in Ireland?\nI see my pub as a little piece of Ireland in Bonn. It is a place for conversation and a place to relax. Although I've had to adapt to my surroundings at various times, I've always retained an authentic Irish feel. Our kitchen always uses Irish products - if we can't import them, we make them ourselves. We even make our own ketchup! We host an extremely popular pub quiz on Monday, have a Celtic music session every Wednesday and karaoke on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday we cook up a roast to feed the growing local community of students, whose mensas or canteens are closed on Sundays.\nWhat attracts Germans to Irish culture?\nThe element of Irish culture most popular with the Germans is the \"authenticity\". We have our own resident butcher who can be seen in action while he works in the kitchen, and our German customers love the authenticity of the spectacle. The rawness of the music and the taste of the beer, all these things make for a great atmosphere that gives them a unique experience.\nHow international is your clientele?\nIn recent times it has become very international. I would say Germans still make up around 85 percent, but the recent influx of Erasmus students and international business has had an effect. In the past few years, 300 new student apartments have been constructed within 100 metres of the pub, and we've recognised the need to readjust our prices for the new demographic. Bonn's United Nations connections are also growing with new conference centres springing up, and that brings a lot of international business. The city is changing all the time.\nHow important is it for you to be able to speak German at work?\nI can speak to the bank manager or the corner shop owner in German, but in the pub I speak English with my customers. I have to maintain that air of authenticity - when people come to an Irish pub, they want to hear that immediately recognisable accent.\nWhat advice would you give to foreigner considering setting up a bar or restaurant in Germany?\nFirst and foremost, read the regulations!

Firing across the Syrian-Lebanese border is no longer an unusual occurrence, as The Christian Science Monitor has reported.\nAnd in Israel, which appreciated the decades-long cold war reached between the two after fighting multiple wars, 78 percent of those polled said spreading instability was a problem.\nBut countries farther afield share the unease of those whose borders are now inundated with desperate Syrians. Eighty-nine percent of Tunisians and 77 percent of Egyptians told Pew that they were worried about violence destabilizing the region, already in upheaval because of revolutions throughout the Arab world.\nPublic opinion is unquestionably not in favor of the US and European countries arming the Syrian opposition, however, with the exception of Jordan, where a slight majority (53 percent) support doing so. Reticence is strongest in Lebanon, where arms are almost certainly flowing already across the border as both rebels and Assad-allied Hezbollah fighters move back and forth andcitizens are braced for tensions to explode into open conflict.\nEighty percent of Lebanese oppose Western arming of the rebels, and even among Sunnis, who are generally sympathetic to the predominantly Sunni opposition, a solid majority of 66 percent oppose the West sending military aid. Unsurprisingly, almost all (98 percent) Lebanese Shiites oppose sending arms; the regime\u2019s base is predominantly Alawite, a Shiite sect.\nThe picture changes slightly when such aid is coming from other Arab countries, but only Lebanese Sunnis join Jordan in supporting the idea \u2013 65 percent of Jordanians favor sending arms and other military supplies, while 63 percent of Lebanese Sunnis do (to show how starkly divided Lebanon is over the Syrian war, hold that up against the 97 percent of Lebanese Shiites who oppose Arab countries sending military aid).\nThe results should be examined with the caveat that the poll was conducted in March, before evidence surfaced that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons.\nDemands from US politicians for stronger action against Assad have mounted since that revelation, and American public support has followed suit, growing from 25 percent to 45 percent \u2013 but falling short"}

Eventful.com began as an event listing service in September 2005, but the recent addition of its \"Eventful Demand\" function is helping the masses have a hand in event booking.\n\"When Eventful started, some people wanted an events wish list, kind of like the Amazon.com wish list,\" said Brian Dear, founder and chairman of EVDB Inc. (Events and Venues Database), which supports Eventful.com. \"But the idea of creating a wish list when there's very little likelihood of fulfillment of the wishes seemed pretty lame. It was like if you made a list of all the events that you would love to go to but they'll never come about \u2014 it's depressing.\n\"So the idea behind Demand is that it's not good enough just to build a list of your favorite wished-for events, you've got to build a whole set of tools to enable people to work together and cause the event, kind of force it into being,\" he added.\nThe idea for Eventful Demand originated in 1999 when Dear worked for online music resource MP3.com. Jokingly referring to it as \"battle of the fans,\" Dear aspired to pit cities against each other as they vied for a band's attention, with the ultimate goal being that the performer would agree to a show in whichever city sparked the most support.\nAlthough it's only a few months old and still in its beta phase, Demand has already accumulated 4,000 requests. It works like this: A user can create a demand for a band, author or any type of event in a particular locality. Once support for the demand reaches a specific \"critical mass\" number, Eventful will act as an online agent and approach the performer with the request. The site keeps users updated as to whether or not the artist has agreed to the gig, as well as the details of the scheduled event if all goes according to plan.\nAnd there's proof that Eventful can work: A campaign on the site by Bostonians convinced actor/author/celebrity blogger Wil Wheaton to set up a book reading and signing that drew more than 200 people. Current demands include requests for former \"American Idol\" stars Constantine Maroulis, Anthony Fedorov and Kimberley Locke, as well as multi-culti funk band Ozomatli, pop folkie Ben Jelen and electro-rock outfit Mute Math.\nDear admits that for now, the site would require thousands of demands to draw arena-level acts such as U2, so in the meantime Eventful has become a haven for indie and up-and-coming acts.\nAnd while MySpace may be the best way for undiscovered bands to get noticed, Eventful is emerging as a handy source for bands to gauge interest and identify key fanbases. Many artists are beginning to direct traffic to Eventful via their MySpace pages in an effort to expand their exposure and use it as a guide when setting up gigs.\nSimilar to MySpace, the site also features some social-networking tools, such as the ability to post a picture, leave comments about demands and join groups.

Pignone, who has a mile-a-minute, Gatling-gun speaking style, recognizes that she wears on the nerves of those who don't like what she has to say (namely some of her county commission colleagues).\nbent Chairman Linda Chapin: She'll talk until people pay her to stop.\n\"I've been telling people I'll shut up if you give me the money,\" Pignone said.\nCommissioner Mable Butler, who minces words for no one, retorted: \"I've heard enough of you, and I sure ain't going to give you any money.\"\nAMONG CANDIDATES. One candidate for an Orlando City Council seat appears to be in; a second looks like he is out. And a former City Council candidate has been exonerated of a voting violation charge and might run for the Orange County Commission.\nConfused? Let's straighten it all out.\nJohn Perez, a 35-year-old picture framer, apparently has gathered enough signatures to put his name on the ballot for the District 3 council seat held by Jeff Clark, who is stepping down after 12 years in office.\nBy securing the signatures of 311 registered voters in the district that encompasses neighborhoods such as College Park, Rosemont and Park Lake, Perez will not have to pay a $722.18 qualifying fee.\nEric McIntire, a courier, was not as fortunate. It seems he did not get the necessary 192 signatures to avoid the qualifying fee to run for the District 5 seat held by Nap Ford, who is seeking re-election. Ford represents neighborhoods such as Parramore, Lake Dot and Callahan.\nThe signatures have been verified by the Orange County Supervisor of Elections office, but the results have not been released officially.\nAnd that brings us to Rufus Hawkins, a health and beauty aids wholesaler who was defeated two years ago in his bid to unseat Sheldon Watson from his District 6 City Council seat.\nAfter the race, Hawkins was accused of not living in the city when he was campaigning. That charge was dismissed earlier this year by Orange Circuit Judge Belvin Perry.\nHawkins, his name cleared, now is contemplating running this fall against County Commissioner Mable Butler, who represents western sections of Orange."}

When taken as a whole, the CSIRO survey results showed the vast majority agreed that climate change was an issue of concern, says Reser.\nHe says one problem with survey designs is that questions can often be framed in a way that presents a false dichotomy to survey respondents.\nFor example, the CSIRO study asked respondents to choose between the following statements: \"I think that climate change is happening, but it's just a natural fluctuation in Earth's temperatures\" or \"I think that climate change is happening, and I think that humans are largely causing it\".\nThis gave no option for people who believed both natural fluctuations and human activity contributed substantially to climate change, says Reser.\nAlso, says Reser, some survey questions elicit a response that confuses beliefs about the severity of climate change and"}

Baloch said the leaders of this nature could never bring about any change and that a change could be brought about by those who remain committed to their words and refused to yield to every pressure. He said a stage had come when the masses were not ready to believe in what the Prime Minister was saying and the expectations of the people from the PTI government had not been fulfilled and they were disappointed. Liaqat Bloch said leading Ulema and religious scholars of the country, Mashaikh, leaders of different religious and political parties, senior journalists and columnists besides representatives of students, lawyers, Kissans and workers would participate.

{"idx": "22998", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: City of Lawrence solid waste division workers empty containers into the back of a trash truck in this file photo from December 2009.\nLawrence city commissioners will soon decide whether to hire a consultant to study the city\u2019s solid waste service and the collection rates charged to Lawrence residents.\nCurrently, residential customers pay $18.80 per month for trash and recycling collection, and commercial customers pay a wide range of fees based on the size of container and number of pickups per month, according to the city\u2019s fee schedule. However, it has been several years since the last cost analysis, and Solid Waste Division Manager Kathy Richardson said the city doesn\u2019t know at this point whether the current rates are in line with the city\u2019s costs.\nThe city advertised a request for proposal for the study in December, and city staff is recommending that the commission approve a contract with Burns & McDonnell for $59,140 for the Solid Waste Rate Study, according to a city staff memo to the commission. The memo states that although the contract falls within the threshold for city manager approval, the action will result in development of a comprehensive solid waste rate model that will guide future rate decisions.\nThe proposed study follows a similar review of the trash rates for downtown businesses, which have their own unique model. Last year, the city found that close to 150 downtown businesses had been charged incorrect trash rates, some for several years. However, after analyzing the rates, city leaders decided they would not retroactively bill or credit those customers because the rate structure the city had been using was flawed and actually overcharged customers.\nRichardson said the proposed study would provide an updated analysis of the costs for all the services the city provides, including residential and commercial trash, recycling and yard waste collection.\nThe study proposed by Burns & McDonnell includes a review of solid waste division billing data, completion of a cost of service analysis, cost allocation, development of service rates, and presentation of study results, according to the memo.\n\u2022 In other business, the city will consider another study to analyze the stormwater rates. City staff is recommending a consulting agreement with Raftelis Financial Consultants for $47,700 for that study."}
