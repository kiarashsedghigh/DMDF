{"idx": "7005", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Is it possible to have too much transparency in journalism?\nIt's not standard operating procedure for news organizations to release full transcripts of their interviews. But it could be a useful practice, particularly for contentious interviews, according to the Poynter Institute's Al Thompkins.\nFormer FBI Director James Comey was doing the rounds of TV studios this week to promote his new book, A Higher Loyalty. First up was ABC News and an interview with George Stephanopoulos that lasted nearly five hours.\nWhat viewers saw, though, was a heavily edited, hour-long version of that conversation. In television terms, it was still an eternity. But those wondering what might have been left out could satiate their curiosity, line by line, after ABC News opted to release the transcript of the full interview online.\nClearly, the interest was there. ABC News president James Goldston told the Associated Press the move was all in the name of transparency. But it also became the most popular item on the news organization's website.\nAnd ABC News may have started a trend, at least as far as Comey is concerned. Rachel Maddow of MSNBC got her interview with Comey on Thursday night, the transcript of which was \"just as importantly\" posted on MSNBC's website.\nAll of this is not normal procedure for a news organization.\n\"One reason we watch television is so you can do the work of cutting it down and making sense of it,\" said Al Tompkins, a broadcast news specialist with the Poynter Institute, a Florida-based non-profit school for journalists.\nSpeaking this week on The Investigators with Diana Swain, Tompkins said he doesn't think releasing the entire transcripts of interviews will become a widespread practice \"but for truly contentious interviews, it could be useful.\"\nWatch the full interview with Al Tompkins on The Investigators, Saturday at 9:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 5:30 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\n\"It might also force us as journalists, as people who make our living talking and asking questions, to more carefully craft our questions, to think about what we're asking and how we ask it. That's fair,\" he said.\n\"I think that if we're going to hold people up for scrutiny for the way they answer questions, maybe we ought to be held up to more scrutiny for the way we ask them.\"\nBut in the age of so-called fake news, is the release of full transcripts happening because journalists feel compelled to prove their credibility? Or to defend themselves from criticism for what did make it to air? Goldston said his organization has nothing to hide but admitted self-defence played a part.\n\"It could prevent people from asking 'Why didn't you ask this,' when we knew we had asked the question.\"\nFor Tompkins, some viewers will just never be convinced.\n\"If you don't want to trust me, there's no amount of disclosure that's going to help you do that. If you're not open to some truth, I really can't help you with that,\" he said. \"Transparency isn't going to solve the problem of people who absolutely don't want it, they're looking for what they agree with.\"\nOwen Leitch is the Toronto-based senior producer of The Investigators with Diana Swain."}

Whether you're trying to plan a surprise birthday party for a friend or a rendezvous with your secret lover, sending or receiving a text message can sometimes make a conversation public that you wish had stayed private.\nThe $.99 app sends what appears to be blacked-out messages using Apple's iMessage. When you receive a black SMS you then copy the message from your Messages folder, and then paste it into the Black SMS app to reveal what it actually says.\nMuch like the invisible ink of the past, reading a message will also require a decoder in the form of a password, so if someone gets ahold of your phone and figures out the Black SMS message app, he or she still will need to know the password in order to read the secret tweets.\nCheck out the video above to see how the app works.\nWhile the app could certainly come in handy for situations where you want to keep conversations under wraps, it is also likely to draw attention to the fact you're having secret conversations in the first place.

Backups are happening throughout the day. To be safe, give yourself an extra half hour if you head to the airport on 50 between Howe Avenue and downtown anytime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.\nWhy is I-80 lane closed?\nSeveral readers this week asked why Caltrans suddenly closed the new eastbound lane on I-80 in Natomas after opening it a few weeks ago? It\u2019s bad news.\nCaltrans said it opened that lane \u2013 a future carpool lane \u2013 only to help ease traffic regionally during the recent eastbound lane closures on Fix50 downtown. As soon as those closures ended, that lane closed to prepare for a series of major lane closures on that freeway in the next year so that Caltrans can rip out and replace some older lanes. Those closures could be as disruptive as any during Fix50.\nNearly three out of every four 911 calls is now made via cellphone. This week, the state Senate OK\u2019d a bill by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Los Angeles, that would allow people to text 911 in emergencies rather than call. SB 1211 would help modernize the state emergency network, Padilla says, and could be useful in home break-ins, hostage situations, or other instances where a voice call could be dangerous. It requires technological work that could take a few years, though.\nIt\u2019s legal for drivers to call 911 to report an emergency. It\u2019s uncertain whether it will be legal to text, though.\nIt seems like many drivers still talk on cellphones. But the latest study by the state Office of Traffic Safety and UC Berkeley suggests the numbers are dropping. The count, in which researchers observe drivers around the state, found 6.6 percent of drivers are talking on cellphones at any given moment, some legally on hands-free phones, some illegally on hand-held phones. That\u2019s a drop from 7.4 percent last year."}

I then add that sending a man to the moon was the easy part, the bigger challenge was bringing him home alive. After seeing \"The Martian\" with my family this weekend and pondering the race against time for the movie's characters, I began to think about the Houston Independent School District school board candidates I heard at the Children at Risk debate last week. Those who are elected face urgent challenges.\nRecent headlines have focused on a shortfall in the district's $1.9 billion bond program as well as questions about oversight, and selection of a new superintendent. Indeed, these are critical issues. But I'm equally concerned about the things that don't snare the big headlines.\nWe are at a critical time in education in our community. HISD student performance is essentially stagnant, leaving us with a weakened local workforce pipeline. Our students face enormous social odds; despite a thriving local economy, 80 percent are economically disadvantaged. We are the seventh-largest district in the nation, with one of the most socially and economically diverse populations of any large urban district in the country. We are unique, and there is no obvious model of success in other districts from which we can build. We must chart our own course.\nUnfortunately, from my vantage point as an active HISD parent, I see school board trustees, administrators, teachers, parents, politicians and a plethora of special-interest groups who are more focused on winning their respective ideological battles than a collaborative vision for a path to student success. In the \"The Martian,\" Matt Damon's character, left behind on Mars, sees the seemingly insurmountable odds before him, but he tells himself that the best hope he has is to \"science the [heck]\" out of his predicament. One by one, he tackles the problems and creates innovative solutions, in collaboration with those back on Earth. And that's exactly what we need from HISD trustees: leaders who will \"science the heck\" out of the district's problems, who will put children first in every decision they make, who will collaboratively focus on solutions and who will rise above ideological battles.\nHave a vision for a system of schools that respects our district's long-standing culture of school choice and creates more opportunity and equity within that system, while at the same time providing high-quality neighborhood schools so every family can access the educational environment that best fits their child.\nBe fiscally responsible and make sure that not only is per-student funding equitable districtwide, they also must ensure that additional funding appropriated to a school is used to provide enhanced educational opportunities that result in measurable progress.\nSupport the community schools model, which calls for \"wraparound\" social services to address social and economic challenges that students face outside the classroom. They should seek out partner organizations to provide these services at the facilities where our students spend most of their time - their schools.\nContinue to prioritize the \"Reading by 3\" initiative to make sure every student is reading on grade level by third grade. Before third grade, students are learning to read; after that, they are reading to learn. If they cannot read by the time they complete third grade, their opportunity for success is limited.\nPerhaps most important, trustees need to restore community trust. A series of decisions by the district over recent years, including a flawed magnet review and proposal in 2011 that disregarded parent and community input, and now the controversy over management of the bond funds, has eroded community confidence to the point where even good ideas"}

So what's really interesting about the Z30 is that it has a very large 5-inch Super AMOLED at 720p HD resolution screen here and that's a very big screen for a Blackberry. Right now most Android devices support that or have this kind of screen. But Blackberry is now taking steps into that big screen market.

So you can see, you know, exactly who you wanna talk to first and you don't have to, you know, waste time just, you know, looking at spam and all that kind of stuff.

{"idx": "7033", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As member states prepare for May\u2019s European Parliament elections, the latest Parlemeter survey shows a growing appreciation of the EU by Europeans and an improved awareness on the forthcoming European Parliament elections.\nIn Malta, where elections will be held on Saturday, May 25, the voting age has been lowered to 16 years for the first time. During a series of interviews, Times of Malta found that the majority of students intend to vote in the upcoming European Parliament elections, although some believe they are not informed enough to do so. Moreover, the majority of students interviewed said people should exercise their right to vote, while others identified certain conditions that should be met before youths can cast a well-informed vote.\nOne of the pertinent issues that students feel Europeans are currently faced with is migration. Some interviewees said the distribution of migrants across the EU countries should be addressed by the MEPs elected in the upcoming elections, while others added there should be more tolerance to diversity within Europe.\nFor one Junior College student, the fact that Brexit is looming without the UK having finalised its terms of exit from the European Union was a worrisome subject. Another important issue cited by several students was the global environmental threat of climate change.\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re not doing enough to help the environment,\u201d said one student, adding that this is one of the most important things that MEPs should be aiming to tackle. Students also said that over-construction and the lack of walking and cycling passages could be changed by the elected MEPs.\nOther students at the University of Malta said that gender equality is an area they think MEPs should be addressing. This includes pushing for women\u2019s rights, equal pay and encouraging more women to enter into politics.\nAnother student added he would like to see Malta\u2019s representatives at the European Parliament putting Malta first. Compassion, level-headedness and a positive way of thinking and approaching discussions with other countries were also given importance.\nThe act of voting is regarded not just as a right, but as a duty by many students. Voting is an integral part of the democratic process and students feel that members of society should be engaging in this act in a conscious and informed manner.\n\u201cIf they have a right, they should go and vote because we have to decide what we want for our future,\u201d said one of the students. Others also highlighted the importance of voicing your opinion and taking responsibility for the future of Europe through this democratic act.\nMalta enters the 2019 European Elections as an anomaly of sorts. We are a small State on the periphery of Europe, far from Brussels with limited potential to ensure our voice is heard in a union of 500 million people and yet we are one of the most informed and fully engaged countries in the EU. In previous European Parliament elections we registered the highest turnout of any country where voting is not obligatory and there is little to suspect that we will not repeat this high turnout on May 25.\nFrom the interviews undertaken with students, it\u2019s encouraging to see young people engaging with the elections and articulating their concerns. Many of the issues they highlight, including migration and the environment have been perennial concerns of the Maltese as expressed in Eurobarometer surveys throughout the years. In terms of Brexit and the gender gap, these are issues which appear to be a growing concern, both locally and abroad.\nHowever, while many people look to the EU to solve national problems, the EU does not always have the right to involve itself in certain matters, like taxation, social policy or culture. In these and other areas, the member states wish to maintain their control and exclude the EU from significant involvement. This has been seen clearly"}

The financial results reveal that Partypoker has enjoyed significant growth while 888poker\u2019s online poker revenue suffered greatly. PokerStars is taking things slow and still holds on to the number one spot of being the biggest online poker room in the world.\n888poker, which was second only to PokerStars when it comes to online poker revenue, has now descended to third place just behind partypoker after suffering a massive decline of 37% in revenue during 2018 figure. Revenues dropped down to $49 million, from the $77.9 million recorded in 2017.\nThis marks the second lowest online poker revenue generated by parent company 888 Holdings since 2010, when it recorded only $38.4 million, and also marks the second time that online poker has been overtaken by other gambling verticals. In 2010, Bingo overtook online poker, and in 2018 sports betting revenue overtook online poker revenue. Online poker accounted for only 10% of the total gaming revenue gained by 888 Holdings in 2018.\nThe latest figures also show that 888\u2019s online poker revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was lower than every quarter from Q1 in 2014 to Q2 in 2017.\n888poker is dealing with the current dip in revenue by running rake-free tournaments and several other promotions. The online poker room is also considering a complete overhaul, which is aimed at attracting more customers and keeping existing players loyal to the brand.\nPokerStars still leads the online poker race, recording an increase of 1.1% for the entire 2018 financial year. Parent company the Stars Group announced that PokerStars generated $886.6 million in total revenue which represents marginal growth from 2017, but still significantly higher than its leading competitors.\nPokerStars suffered a 10% drop in revenue in the last quarter of 2018, generating just $211 million, compared to the same period in 2017. While the company blames currency fluctuations for the revenue decline, Q4 figures still fell by 4.4% on a constant currency basis.\nPoker is still a major revenue stream for The Stars Group, making up 61.6% of its total 2018 revenue. Casino and sports betting verticals also yielded positive results, with revenue jumping almost four-fold from $136 million in 2015 to $507 million in 2018. These two verticals now account for 35.5% of the company\u2019s revenue.\nCEO of The Stars Group Rafi Ashkenazi said while the increase in casino and sports betting revenue indicates positive development, it has impacted revenue for poker as some players are now spending a portion of their bankrolls at the online casino. Online poker continues to be a major contributor to the company\u2019s growth, which allows for the cross-selling of online casino and sports betting games.\nGVC Holdings which is the parent company of partypoker is very happy with the 2018 results. GVC CEO Kenneth Alexander made a presentation on partypoker\u2019s 2018 performance and said the online poker room is in hot pursuit of topping PokerStars from the number one"}

Khangah is a millionaire who is close to the Aliyev family, the ruling dynasty of Azerbaijan.\nParticularly close is his relation to the powerful Azerbaijani minister for emergency situations Kamaladdin Heydarov, according to US embassy cables published in Wikileaks.\nAccording to these same cables, in which the US embassy in Baku profiled the most powerful families in Azerbaijan back in 2010, Khangah was said to be in business with the children of Heydarov. The US cable claimed that Khangah was the CEO or \u201cfront man\u201d of a substantial portion of the Heydarov family conglomerate.\nThe cable states that in one example, Kamaladdin Heydarov\u2019s two sons Nijat and Tale wanted to buy two Gulfstream jets, valued at $20 million each. Ownership of the Gulfstreams was to be shared between a Dubai-registered company Shams al Sahra, owned by the Heydarovs, and Khangah.\nThe company Shams al Sahra has a familiar ring: Daphne Caruana Galizia claims the Al Sahra FZCO of Dubai was used in a money transfer from Leyla Aliyeva to Egrant; and the questions from the Times that the PM\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri published on Facebook last week, referred to \u201cHeydarov\u2019s front man\u201d \u2013 which Schembri claimed he did not know, when asked whether he had introduced him to Nexia BT.\nThe activities of Khangah in Malta, gleaned from MFSA records, no doubt raise questions.\nIn January 2015, Nexia BT opened up Mulsanne Investments for Khangah, together with six subsidiaries under a familiar musical nomenclature \u2013 the Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Vivaldi investment holding companies. All of them are registered in Malta.\nTheir company-in-formation account was opened at Pilatus Bank, as public MFSA records show.\nAdditionally, the companies opened in January 2015 and closed down officially on 15 December, exactly short of the 12 months that would have required the companies to present a statutory audit.\nInstead, all that was required were just liquidation accounts. Mulsanne Investments recorded no cash at bank or in hand, but accumulated losses of \u20ac627,198, which were offset by a shareholders\u2019 loan from Khangah of a roughly equal amount of \u20ac627,717.\nThese accounts do not break down the expenses incurred, except for the declaration of solvency for Mulsanne Investments listed the total liabilities as being mainly the accumulated loss of \u20ac627,198.\nMulsanne"}

The timing of the tender and the number of concessions are still undecided.\n\"It involves putting licensing rounds for current open acreage in Sharjah that\u2019s not at the moment with any other companies and if any of the current occupied acreage becomes open in the future, we\u2019d put it for the rounds too,\" Mr Al Mosa said. \"We haven't decided the timing yet, it could be this year, it could be 2020.\"\nPlans for further exploration follow Sharjah's first-ever competitive bid in which Italian oil and gas company Eni won three concessions earlier this month. The bid, which was launched last year, awarded Eni areas A, B and C onshore exploration concessions. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company also awarded this month two offshore exploration blocks to a consortium led by Eni and PTT Exploration and Production Public Company of Thailand in its first-ever competitive bid round.\nMr Al Mosa said he is confident in his company's ability to plug Sharjah's energy shortages as the emirate intensifies efforts for exploration.\n\"I feel very comfortable, with the plans already on the table and contracts we\u2019re seeking, that we will be able to close 100 per cent of the chronic shortage of gas in Sharjah and hopefully have excess to satisfy industrial demand in the northern emirates,\" he said.\nSNOC will undertake the pre-work, such as the seismic survey it conducted prior to tendering the first competitive bid, before announcing any future tenders.\n\"For any future bid rounds we want to do as much pre-work as possible to make sure it\u2019s a successful bid round,\" Mr Al Mosa said. \"We\u2019re doing pre-work all the time. It's about when do we have enough work to make us comfortable to start this bid round.\"\nMr Al Mosa declined to comment on current gas production rates but said its \"significantly lower\" than the design capacity of its gas processing plant, creating the opportunity to ramp up production if a new discovery is made.\nIn the case of a \"small\" discovery of gas, the company would divert all of its production to the local market, he said.\nIn case of larger discoveries, it plans to divert the liquids pumped with gas to the market and put a portion of the gas back into the ground to \"maintain the pressure (of reservoirs) and give maximum recovery of the liquids,\" he said.\nProduction of gas and condensate, a liquid found with gas, in the emirate is profitable and provides a \"good revenue stream\" for the government, he said, declining to comment on production costs.\nSNOC is also working on developing an offshore liquefied natural gas import terminal to\" close the long-term gap\" in Sharjah energy demand and will continue to seek imports as long as demand exceeds local supply, he said.

Hiking trails and guided tours allow visitors to get near the edge of the glacier. While travelers can hike out onto the glacier, officials do not recommend making the trek because tourists have died due to hidden crevasses in the past.\nIf you do want to explore the glacier's surface, or are simply looking for an excellent tour, recent visitors suggested taking an Ice Explorer tour onto the Athabasca Glacier. Past travelers raved about the entertaining tour guides and the opportunities to safely explore the ice. Each trip last between two and three hours (including 20 minutes on the ice), and all excursions include access to the Glacier Skywalk.\nThe Ice Explorer tours depart from the Columbia Icefield Discovery Centre, about 65 miles south of downtown Jasper, where travelers can park for free. Tours of the Athabasca Glacier are available from mid-April to mid-October, but tours are dependent on the weather. Tickets cost CA$109 (about $83) and CA$55 (about $42) for adults and kids, respectively, while advanced purchases reduce the prices to CA$99 (about $75) and CA$49 about ($37).

The student survived but Tanner did not.\nTanner\u2019s portrait is displayed in the VHS North lobby.\nAnnual scholarships are awarded in Tanner\u2019s memory.\nAnd now DeWinne, backed by the VHS Historical Committee, is looking for a more high-profile memorial.\nShould Vineland High School North change name to honor former VHS asst. principal Dennis Tanner, who died saving a student's life in 1980?\n\u201cWe wholeheartedly support the concept to posthumously honor Mr. Tanner\u2019s selflessness in sacrificing his life to save one of his students,\u201d Keith Petrosky, VHS Historical Society secretary, wrote in a Nov. 23, 2015 letter to school board president Scott English.\nFirst, the board must determine if they want to name the school in honor of any individual, School Board President Chris Jennings said Monday.\nThe recent trend is to honor a legacy by dedicating a portion of a school in someone\u2019s honor, Jennings said, noting it offers more opportunity to showcase those who have made contributions to the school district. He noted the recent dedication of the Charles \u201cChalky\u201d Ottinger foyer at VHS South.\nShould a board majority support a school-naming tribute, they will vote Feb. 8 to kickstart the process established by district policy.\nAlthough there\u2019s a request to honor Tanner on the table, the policy mandates the public be invited to nominate people they feel also are deserving of consideration.\nPolicy specifies nominees must have \u201csignificantly contributed\u201d their time, talents, funds or resources to a program, sport, activity, school, facility or volunteer organization within the district or city. A person must have died at least five years before the vote to be eligible for the tribute.\nThe public have at least 20 days to submit written nominations that should include background information about the person they are recommending.\nAfter the submission deadline, the board is required to host a special meeting for the public to comment on the nominees before they vote.\nThis process was employed to name Thomas Wallace Jr. Middle School, Pauline J. Petway Elementary School, Gloria M. Sabater Elemenetary and Casimer Dallago Preschool.\nIn this case, Jennings noted the Vineland High School name would not change. It is the name of the building that would be under consideration.\nFor example, he said, if the Tanner request were successful, VHS North would then be called the Tanner Building at VHS.\nDeWinne noted the building has gone through several monikers over the years, including VHS 9-10 and VHS North.\nMost recently, the school administration dubbed the building \"3010\" after its East Chestnut Avenue address.\nThe work session is scheduled for 6 p.m. Wednesday"}

This transformation culminated in the penultimate episode of Season 4, \u201cThe Animals,\u201d in which a beloved character, Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley), was crushed to death by a prison guard\u2014a heartbreaking event that united the female inmates of Litchfield against an increasingly punitive system. In the wake of her death, a particularly sadistic guard brought a gun to work, and the season ended with his weapon being coopted by Daya (Dascha Polanco), in a tense cliffhanger that left viewers wondering whether or not she\u2019d pull the trigger.\nOrange has always trafficked in echoes and parallels to point out that all people\u2014whichever side of the bars they\u2019re on\u2014are essentially flawed in the same ways, and that a corrupt system crushes everyone. Hence the show\u2019s decision to have the most sympathetic guard, the baby-faced Bayley (Alan Aisenberg) be the one who accidentally killed Poussey. \u201cYeah, yeah, we know,\u201d a character says early in Season 5, released in its entirety on Friday. \u201cPower erupts.\u201d In the past, Orange has emphasized the humanity of the female inmates, showing the emotional complexity and troubled histories of women who are often stereotyped or unfairly judged. But the new season, by contrast, seems intent on proving how flawed all people are. Set over the course of just three days, as a riot plays out, it\u2019s less a work of entertainment than a sociological experiment, turning the pressure up on the prisoners and flipping Litchfield\u2019s hierarchy upside down.\nThis is a characteristically bold move by Jenji Kohan, Orange\u2019s showrunner\u2014a gamble that\u2019s high-risk, and, as emerges in the first half of the new season, low reward. The show\u2019s cast has grown to the point of unwieldiness by now, and the result of following so many characters through such a short time period is that the plot becomes sprawling and tentacular, spending far too much time with characters who aren\u2019t doing anything at all, and neglecting others to the point of collapse. It very quickly becomes clear that Thomas Hobbes was right\u2014Litchfield\u2019s state of nature is rough.\nAmid the chaos and the cruelty, Orange\u2019s insistence that it\u2019s still a comedy is jarring. In the first episode, for instance, while the bewildered guards and inmates are still deciphering what\u2019s going down, a running joke features different characters referencing mass shootings: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Charleston, Aurora, Fort Hood. What\u2019s presumably meant to be a dig at the cultural impact of these atrocities feels tonally graceless. And the show\u2019s leaps between Taystee (Danielle Brooks)\u2014who\u2019s using her rage at her friend\u2019s death to demand justice\u2014and the jauntily anarchic behavior of other groups of inmates continually disrupts the pathos.

Paragraph 1 of this article says that everyone has the right to respect for his (or her) family life.

But even if it did, the law lords added, it was justified by the exceptions in paragraph 2.\nThe Strasbourg court reached a slightly different conclusion, holding that the Suicide Act did interfere with paragraph 1 but that the interference was justified by paragraph 2.\nThat is the loophole that David Pannick QC, for Ms Purdey, hopes to exploit. He says that one of the requirements of paragraph 2 is that the law should be \u201cforeseeable\u201d.

Commercially speaking, while the subject and minority-led cast should be selling points to appreciative black auds, the pic\u2019s limiting factor will be its overly square execution.\nThough overseen by Lucas, \u201cRed Tails\u201d marks the feature debut of director Anthony Hemingway, an experienced TV helmer who counts episodes of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cTreme\u201d among his many credits. Here, the scale is larger but the narrative opportunities more limited, boxed in by the two-hour running time. Thus, the ensemble is limited primarily to personality traits established in the film\u2019s opening minutes, with most of the attention split between by-the-book college boy Marty \u201cEasy\u201d Julian (Nate Parker, carrying himself like a young Denzel Washington), who serves as squad leader, and daredevil best friend Joe \u201cLightning\u201d Little (David Oyelowo, who can\u2019t help mugging for the camera).\nBut instead of emphasizing the casualties suffered by the 332nd Fighter Group (66 deaths in all, of which only two are depicted), \u201cRed Tails\u201d celebrates the team\u2019s collective heroism. If a 1925 U.S. Army survey found that so-called \u201ccolored personnel\u201d were \u201cunfit for military service,\u201d the film demonstrates how the 332nd proved otherwise on the strength of its achievements, drawing inspiration from John B. Holway\u2019s book \u201cRed Tails, Black Wings: The Men of America\u2019s Black Air Force\u201d (the title refers to the planes\u2019 signature markings).\nTime and again the film conveys how racist bureaucrats intended the experiment to fail at a time when segregation was the norm. Though the U.S. Army Air Corps trained nearly 1,000 black pilots in Tuskegee, Ala., once in the field, the military equipped them with rundown planes and assigned them low-profile missions far behind enemy lines (seamless visual effects allow the Prague-based shoot to simulate Italian locations). Despite such setbacks, Lightning is itching for combat, frequently disobeying orders whenever the chance to score an enemy kill arises, as in a neat singlehanded showdown between him and a German supply train early in the film.\nThese airborne scenes are frequently dazzling, cutting between the cockpits of the various pilots (a la \u201cStar Wars\u201d) and the broader canvas against which fancy loops and spins take place. Still, for all their visual polish, such maneuvers lack the thrill of practical stuntwork.\nBy sheer coincidence, Paramount recently restored William Wellman\u2019s 1927 Oscar winner \u201cW"}

The Pit will never be as welcoming to guests as a new car showroom, but when you blow a 25-point lead in the second half, like the Lobos did against the Wolf Pack on Jan. 7, well, your home gym loses a bit of its aura.\nThat's why the title of toughest place to play in the Mountain West is now vacant. And it's time for Lawlor Events Center and its fans to stand up and be counted, grab the title by the collar over these next two months, paint it silver and blue and place it next to the Fremont Cannon for safe keeping.\nWhy not Lawlor? Why not Pack fans? The circular cement palace that has housed the Wolf Pack since the 1983-84 season clearly deserves to be ranked among the top contenders for the title of toughest place to play in the Mountain West. The Pack are 7-0 at home this season and 23-3 since Eric Musselman became head coach before the 2015-16 season. This is the Pack's best home record over a 26-game stretch since it was 24-2 from Nov. 17, 2011 to Dec. 28, 2013.\nLawlor has never gotten the credit it deserves for intimidating opponents. Nevada was 60-6 at home from 2004-07, making Lawlor The Pit of the Far West. The Pack were 15-0 at Lawlor in 2003-04, winning 18 in a row at home during one stretch.\nLawlor hasn't been all that frightening to opponents since the Pack joined the Mountain West. That 24-2 stretch the Pack once enjoyed at home a few years back? Well, coincidentally or not, it ended a mere 15 days before the Pack played their first home game as a member of the Mountain West.\nUntil Musselman came to town, the Pack only managed a 24-23 home record during their first three seasons in the Mountain West. That's the type of home record that can make your home gym as quiet as a mausoleum and get your coach fired, which it did to David Carter following the 2014-15 season. You had to mention about seven or eight venues in the Mountain West before you got to Lawlor when listing the toughest places to play in the conference.\nThat's why this opportunity \u2014 claiming the title as the toughest place to play in the conference \u2014 is important for Lawlor and the Wolf Pack to claim right now. It's a title, after all, that isn't offered all that often.

While both films may have left something to be desired in terms of plot, they were both very successful at the box office.\nIn the coming years, Disney will also release live-action renditions of Cinderella and The Jungle Book from Kenneth Branagh and Jon Favreau, respectively.

Warner Bros. announced the Andy Serkis-helmed project, now titled The Jungle Book: Origins, will be released October 21st, 2016, following Disney\u2019s version little more than a year later (Favreau\u2019s The Jungle Book will hit theaters October 9th 2015). No casting has been announced on Serkis\u2019 Origins.\nDisney, on the other hand, announced Bill Murray has been cast as the voice of Baloo, a bear and Mowgli\u2019s (Neel Sethi) friend.

The screenplay, written by Steve and Callie Kloves, is \u201ctruthful\u201d to the tone of the original book.\nMeanwhile, Disney's take on the adaptation, with Favreau in charge, indicates a lighter take on Kipling\u2019s novel. Indeed, the Elf and Iron Man director has described his Jungle Book adaptation as being \"a family brand with certain mythic elements.\"\nWhether or not Disney and Favreau\u2019s The Jungle Book is more lighthearted or captures the darkness of the source material, hopefully the film will be different enough from Serkis\u2019 Origins in order to keep viewers interested, though the responsibility is more on Warner Bros. and Serkis in this instance as their film will be released in the wake of Disney's.\nDisney\u2019s upcoming film is the studio\u2019s third adaptation of Kipling\u2019s novel: previously, there was the 1967 animated film and the 1994 live-action movie.

{"idx": "7090", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: You can deduct expenses for your home-based business if you follow some guidelines. The home-office deduction once triggered audits fairly regularly, but changes in the tax laws have helped legitimize expenses for the person who works from home. However, you need to look at examples of acceptable deductions so you can understand how to reduce your business taxes without raising any red flags with the Internal Revenue Service.\nYou may be able to deduct a percentage of the payments you make for rent or house payments. Figure this percentage based on how much space you use for your home business. If, for example, you use 15 percent of your square footage for your office, you can write off 15 percent of rent or mortgage payments. To qualify for this deduction, you must use the space exclusively for your business. Make your office space a dedicated work area by using dividers to separate the area from living quarters. A separate room for your office will also qualify you for this deduction. The exclusive-use rule does not apply to home-based day care centers or to storage of inventory and product samples.\nIf you qualify to deduct a portion of your rent or mortgage, then you can also deduct a percentage of your home utilities. You arrive at this percentage the same way you do for your rent or mortgage payment deductions, based on the percentage of your home that you use exclusively for business purposes. For example, if you use 10 percent of your home as an office, you can write off 10 percent of your utility bills.\nIf you have a second telephone line in your home that's used only for business purposes, you can write off the full cost. This line qualifies as a business expense because you would not need it if not for your business. Avoid making personal calls on this line so that you can easily support your claim that it is a business line.\nYou may write off the cost of office supplies that you purchase for your business. Make an effort to keep business supplies separate from items for personal use. You can write off a printer, paper, ink, staples, pens, postage, paper clips and even a paperweight if you use these items exclusively for your business.\nInstead of writing off the full value of computers and furniture all at once, you must depreciate these items. That means you can write off a portion of the expense over the life of the item. The IRS provides a table of the common lifespan of many business items, but you may also use an estimate based on standards in your industry or the manufacturer\u2019s estimate of how long an item will last."}

They hit a variety of targets throughout the night hours. They hit terrorist camps, they say. They hit munitions dumps. At one point, they hit a cluster of Taliban tanks, that type of thing and returned safely. There was an enthusiastic response from the pilots of the various aircraft.

That will be the commando units, the special forces units and British units that will, in all certainty, become part of this extended operation -- Leon.\nHARRIS: Bob, it appears as though if you listen to their words and you listen to some of the things that were coming -- hearing coming from that region that this operation so far has been amazingly successful and there was very little resistance offered to it. We didn't -- in fact, I was watching yesterday and in our coverage we had live pictures coming from, I believe in Afghanistan or through Al Jezeera, the Middle Eastern cable network, and there was very little any anti-aircraft that was being fired back up in the air. It seemed as though there was almost no resistance at all. Are you getting any sense at all from the people you've talked to there at the Pentagon that perhaps this may be a bit easier than think it's going to -- they thought going in or whatever?\nFRANKEN: Well, no.

They, of course, have some surface- to-air missiles and they have the stingers, some of them that are 20, 30 years old -- 20 years old there.

What a complainant without legal advice would make of them is anyone's guess.\nSecond, the mechanisms for the apportionment of costs between the parties are unnecessarily complex but still create significant downside exposure for a complainant who does not succeed.\nStrangely, there is much more focus on who pays the (relatively modest) arbitration fees, depending on various outcomes, than on who pays the legal costs.\nThe practical reality is that, as with any arbitration, the legal costs on each side are likely to dwarf the arbitration fees.\nIt is therefore difficult to understand why the scheme puts in place so many detailed rules for the latter, while confining itself to some very broad-brush provisions concerning the former.\nThird, a complainant has a number of hoops to jump through even to get a claim into the scheme.\nIt must agree to be legally bound by the outcome (ruling out any future legal proceedings).\nThe newspaper is not obliged to go to arbitration.\nAnd even if it agrees to do so, the rules set out numerous reasons why a claim may be deemed \"unsuitable\", including that it raises \"a novel or complex point of law\".\nIf a claim is straightforward, it can usually be resolved directly with the publication concerned or by way of a complaint to IPSO for breach of the Editors' Code of Practice.\nGiven the choice, it is therefore difficult to see why a complainant would embark on a complicated but private arbitration process, which gives it significantly less leverage against the newspaper than would litigation, or the threat of it, when there is a relatively user-friendly and low or no cost alternative already available of making a complaint direct to IPSO under the Code.\nOn the upside, unlike a Code violation complaint, the scheme will provide remedies similar to those which a Court would be able to award, including damages of up to \u00a350,000.\nAlso, from a presentational perspective at least, it might be viewed as a half-way house between a Code violation complaint \u2013 with no meaningful remedies available \u2013 and legal proceedings.\nFor this reason, it may commend itself to businesses and their PR advisers who wish to put down a marker with the media, and/or to take advantage of the confidentiality of an arbitration, but would prefer to avoid litigation.\nIt will be interesting to see how many takers there are."}

The result was clear. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) received just 41 percent of the vote, costing it the majority it had enjoyed since coming to power in 2002.\nOn November 1, however, after negotiations following the June elections resulted in a hung parliament, Turks voted again, and the outcome could not have been more different. This time, the election was predominantly perceived as a referendum on the continuation of single-party rule, and the AKP won 49 percent of the vote, providing it with a comfortable majority.\nIn the run-up to the latest election, Erdogan and the AKP emphasised the importance of the party's parliamentary majority for Turkey's political stability. The opposition countered with the argument that a coalition government would counter the country's deep political polarisation, while helping to establish stronger checks and balances. The promise of stability proved to be the more resonant message.\nThe political instability following June's inconclusive election had been compounded by a sharp decline in domestic and regional security. A renewed campaign of violence by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), including suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people, created a backdrop that reinforced the AKP's message.\nThe outcome of the vote attests to the ineffectiveness of Turkey's parliamentary opposition, which once again failed to make a dent in the AKP's popularity, almost as if they had set out to disprove the theory that electorates simply tire of long-serving governments.\nInstead, the AKP obtained its landslide victory - a major achievement after 13 years of uninterrupted rule - by siphoning voters from its competitors. The party received nearly five million more votes than it did in June, corresponding to a 20 percent increase in its popularity.\nTwo opposition parties, the conservative Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the predominantly Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), together lost three million votes, while the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) held its ground, finishing second with 25 percent of the vote.\nHow will Turkey's president consolidate his powers?\nVoters punished the nationalist MHP severely for its obstructionism following the June election, when it refused all offers to join a coalition government. With 12 percent of the popular vote, compared to 16 percent in June, the MHP lost almost half of its parliamentary seats. The HDP was handicapped by its inability to distance itself from the PKK, which a large section of the electorate regards as being responsible for the upsurge in domestic violence.\nIndeed, the HDP seemed at risk of failing to obtain the 10 percent of the vote it would need to enter parliament, an outcome that would have provided the AKP with a majority large enough to amend the constitution on its own.

This approach to company operations is in contrast to a decentralized approach, where mangers of local business units or stores make most of the important decisions for their units. Centralization has several benefits relative to decentralization.\nBy centralizing operations, you keep important decisions in the hands of your topic experts. Human resource professionals put together and lead your HR activities. Professional buyers purchase most or all of the products sold at your stores. Marketing experts lead all marketing efforts for the company rather than entrusting local stores with this task. Centralization should lead to the highest quality performance in each of these functional areas.\nRather than having inconsistent decisions made at store levels, centralized companies typically have more consistency in decisions and implementation. Since a core group of HR professionals make decisions and oversee hiring and training, these processes should be generally similar at each business unit. From a marketing perspective, you can build a stronger brand image if each of your business units delivers a similar product and service offering to your customers.\nCosts are normally lower in a centralized setup. This is because you only have to invest company time and resources once in making critical decisions about how to do business. For example, only one product display plan -- sometimes called a \"planogram\" -- must be designed and produced for setting up merchandise displays. You only need to create your interview forms and processes one time. You also get a significant benefit when bargaining with vendors if you make purchase decisions for all stores at once.\nBy going through key decision-making processes and tasks at one time, you eliminate redundancies and waste that can occur through decentralization. For instance, rather than having all local managers spending time and effort devising motivational schemes for employees, you have one or a few HR specialists focusing on this. This helps each store invest time and energy to implement the decisions and tasks delegated from central decision makers, which should improve quality in performance."}

On April 14, the Canucks relieved General Manager/Senior Vice President Dave Nonis of his duties. He was replaced nine days later by former player agent Mike Gillis, who then opted to retain Alain Vigneault as coach.\nWhile Vigneault is staying in Vancouver, others have left town. Markus Naslund, who played the last 11 seasons with the Canucks, signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers in July, while veteran Trevor Linden decided to hang up the blades. Brendan Morrison, who enjoyed four 20-goal campaigns with the club, bolted for the Anaheim Ducks via free agency.\nTragedy struck the franchise on May 29, when 21-year-old defenseman Luc Bourdon was killed in a motorcycle accident. The team's first-round draft choice (No. 10) in 2005, Bourdon had two goals and a plus-7 rating in 27 games last season.\nThe Canucks, though, have done their best to move forward. In desperate need of a high-scoring wing, veteran Pavol Demitra signed a two-year deal July 10. Demitra, 33, had 54 points in 68 games last season with the Minnesota Wild. It marked the first time in 11 campaigns that Demitra didn't score at least 20 goals. The Canucks also acquired forward Steve Bernier from the Buffalo Sabres on July 4 in exchange for draft picks.\n\"Throughout his NHL career, Pavol has proven himself to be an offensive contributor wherever he has played,\" Gillis said. \"Pavol is a strong two-way hockey player with excellent quickness and finish. His playmaking abilities will be an asset on our power play and make him a great addition to our top six forwards.\"\nRegardless of who is playing up front, the Canucks will have a chance to win on a regular basis. Why? Because their last line of defense is arguably the best in the business.\nStill very much in his prime -- he turned 29 in April \u2013Luongo is coming off his third straight season of at least 35 victories. In 2007-08, Luongo appeared in 73 games and went 35-29-9 with a 2.38 goals-against average and .917 save percentage. He has appeared in at least 70 games in each of the past four seasons.\nLuongo will be joined by Curtis Sanford, who opted to return to the Canucks by signing a one-year contract in July. Sanford, who turns 29 on Oct. 5, went 4-3-1 last season with a 2.83 GAA. Should Luongo stay healthy, Sanford probably won't start more than 10 games.

{"idx": "7106", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Facebook's IPO Morality Tale: If The Green Shoes Fit, Wear Them?\nFacebook's reversal of fortunes in such a short span of time has played out almost like a modern-day morality tale. The fall-out of the social network post-IPO, after such an enthusiastic build-up was telling. While it lined the pockets of some (namely investment bankers), it deprived the 99 Percenters (or Dumb F*cks as Zuckerberg so adroitly labeled them back in 2004) full-disclosure, resulting in a subsequent short-fall on their FB investment.\nIn a time when excessive, unregulated profits continue to be eked out on Wall Street, does the Facebook IPO shed additional light on the reverse Robin-Hood business practice of taking from the poor and giving to the rich? It does appear that way if one was to fully understand what went down on May 18th.\nApparently when Morgan Stanley put together the offer, they included one of the few SEC-permitted, risk-free options that allowed them to stabilize the pricing of FB's post-issue. Labeled the \"greenshoe\" option, this caveat permitted the investment banker to over-allot the number of public shares available. The term comes from the first company to use this draconian practice - Green Shoe Manufacturing (now called Stride Rite Corporation).\nFuzzy math comes into play at this point, since it appears that Morgan Stanley and the other major underwriters sold more shares than they bought (basically what the greenshoe option allows them to do). This is done purposely, because it causes a \"short\" in the market which will then prompt an upward pressure on the share price.\nThis however did not take place. Instead as everyone is now aware, FB's stock actually went south. But why?\nWell...on May 9th, Zuckerberg (lampooned for his 'fast shuffles' in the past) issued a revised prospectus that noted the negative impact of mobile users on Facebook's advertising revenue projections. With this new intel, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Bank of America \"reduced\" their FB earnings revenue estimates for the remainder of 2012.\nIn a Reuters' release posted by Poornim Gupta and Alexel Oreskovic, the revised numbers were relayed to big investors via private phone calls. It was noted that Bank of America held a conference call on May 10 with analyst Justin Post, where the underwriter revealed the lower estimates.\nAccording to Rebecca Greenfield's report in the Atlantic Wire, \"After days (months? years?) of hype, Facebook filed amended IPO documents with reduced revenue forecasts buried down on page 57.\" Without public disclosure, while the big boys received this \"unfair advantage\" in the words of Raise, Das and Chon, the general public was still over-reaching based on the zeitgeist fever pitch that motivated them to buy, irregardless of the price.\n\"These people didn't know about the downgrades. And that's how the price got set too high. People on the Buddy Systemoutside wanted it at $42, people in the know wanted it at $32. So we got a compromised $38,\" noted Greenfield. And no one in the know was willing to share this intel. . . say, on a Facebook status update, perhaps? Nope, the well-healed \"buddy system\" was in place, and"}

{"idx": "7108", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Quebec government is considering buying back some taxi permits in order to sell or lease them to Uber.\nThis is the model advocated by Transport Minister Jacques Daoust, but the terms have yet to be determined. A bill would be tabled by the end of March forcing the transport service to follow the new rules.\nOn Thursday, the last day of hearings of the parliamentary commission on the paid transport of people in Quebec, Daoust said the government could buy permits that are on sale, and then lease them in order to generate revenue. The takeover of the permits would thus be at no cost to the Treasury.\nThe value of taxi licenses is estimated between $1.3 and $ 1.7 billion currently at the rate of $150,000 to $200,000 per licence, for 8,500 licences in circulation in the controlled market.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy them, but I will have to find the revenue to be able to purchase them,\u201d said the Minister in a press briefing before the final sitting of the parliamentary committee.\n\u201cWe will not disburse $1.3 or $1.4 billion at the outset, but we can over a period of six to seven years, be fair with the industry. We will give it the flexibility to be able to evolve. And new players, and those who buy licenses, might not be forced to mortgage their future (to buy a license),\u201d he said.\nYear after year, about 500 licences change hands, and as taxi permits are put on sale, the state could buy and then lease them to Uber and its drivers, or to other drivers, in order to recover its stake. The permit holder would not have to shell out a large sum to buy them.\n\u201cThere are ways to achieve the same result (obtaining a permit), with permits you could lease on an annual basis,\u201d said Daoust.\nHowever, no new permits will be issued, and there will be no loosening of the rules of the people transport market. Daoust wants to keep the quota for transport security and quality of service, two non-negotiable demands he has set.\n\u201cIt is difficult to work as an amateur. We\u2019ll have to keep the industry viable and one where a person can earn a living,\u201d he said.\nThe Uber service will be tolerated as long as its drivers hold licences and pay their taxes, the minister said. \u201cUber will have the right to lease licences and to use them. But basically, it\u2019s not true that we will be able to continue to say you don\u2019t need permits, you don\u2019t need to collect GST and QST,\u201d he said.\nFor its part, the official opposition, who vigorously defended the taxi industry and campaigned for tougher sanctions against Uber, reacted cautiously to the framework outlined by the Transport Minister. MP Martine Ouellet, the PQ spokesperson on transport, raised concerns regarding the control of the market.\nOuellet again urged the government to use all means at its disposal \u201cto stop the illegal transport\u201d which is ongoing with Uber.\nParking must be cheaper on the Plateau, residents tell consultation meeting \ue221 Why does Montreal get so many sinkholes?"}

Beckham\u2019s super-skinny designs have received accolades from critics and earned her a place at New York Fashion Week, netting her company $95 million last year. Jessica Simpson\u2019s plus-size-friendly designs, by contrast, made a cool $750 million over the same period of time.\nTired of waiting for Vogue and Elle to meet the demand for plus-size fashion, many women have taken to the Internet to find their wardrobe inspiration. Ranging from blogs purely dedicated to pictures of clothes to feminist diatribes in favor of fat-acceptance and body positivity, the plus-size fashion movement (coined \u201cfatshion\u201d) is a blossoming subculture in the truest sense of the word.\nThe radical undertones of Rutter\u2019s blog ripples throughout much of plus-size fashion community. Their content is often satirical and irreverent, but presented from a strong feminist perspective. Perhaps the most well-known example would be Nancy Upton's controversy-baiting submissions to a modeling competition run by American Apparel, which brilliantly challenged the fashion company\u2019s target demographic with hilarious and hugely popular self-portraits. She won the competition and forced the issue on a national level.\nA similar aesthetic can be found on Tumblr, where people use hashtags like #fatshion and #fatspo to mock the trend of \u201cthinspo,\u201d or thinspiration\u2014the widespread practice of sharing photos and videos of ridiculously slim celebrities and other women to encourage weight loss.\nDeathfatties, a popular Tumblr blog, \u201cis dedicated to showcasing the vitality and visibility of those who self-identify as \"deathfat,\u201d a term coined by the fatshionista LiveJournal community that refers to the BMI chart\u2019s categorization of the morbidly obese. The entries are typically user-generated, comprised of a photo and description of the subjects' clothing, right down to their sizes.\nIt\u2019s a matter of pride, according to Frances, a public servant in Australia who runs the fat-acceptance blog Corpulent.\n\u201cI was sick of never seeing bodies like mine celebrated or even presented as normal in the mainstream media, so I set up my Tumblr to fill the gap,\u201d she said.\nGirl With Curves, by contrast, seems to be aiming directly at the glass ceiling between plus-size and mainstream fashion. The site was originally dedicated to photos of creator Tanesha Awasthi modeling her own outfits, but it\u2019s evolved into something resembling a glossy magazine in its own right, with style tips and a lifestyle section along with the regular photo shoots.\nGirl With Curves boasts 80,000 Tumblr followers and has been featured in Grazia, Glamour and the New York Times.

The site understands the market, mindset and needs of the community, offering inspiration, how-to tutorials and easy social sharing on Pinterest and Instagram.\nSlowly but surely, the"}

Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie\u2019s computerized medical record.\nWith that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who cared for her within the sprawling Partners HealthCare system. She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes.\nJulie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. \u201cThe details are really nobody\u2019s business,\u201d she said.\nBut Partners disagrees. Doctors must have a complete picture to make accurate diagnoses, the organization argues. And having different rules for psychiatric records contributes to the stigma of mental illness.\nThe clash reflects the delicate privacy issues surfacing as electronic medical records become widespread. Providers in separate networks are preparing to share patients\u2019 records more widely online \u2014 to better coordinate care and cut wasteful spending. This will probably intensify the debate about what should and should not be shared, as well as fears about the unauthorized release of patient information.\nBoth the House and Senate health care cost-control bills passed this spring require the state to create a system for sharing records across provider networks. This is also a priority for Governor Deval Patrick, whose administration already is working on the project, which includes stringent patient privacy protections.\nDr. David Blumenthal, Partners\u2019s chief health information and innovation officer and former national coordinator for health information technology for the Obama administration, said the privacy issues \u201care huge.\u2019\u2019 Though technology has advanced to allow providers to share records, patient trust remains an obstacle to adoption of these systems, he said.\nDoctors and hospitals in Massachusetts have been quicker than those in many other states to adopt computerized patient records, with between 35 and 45 percent using at least a basic system, according to a recent study.\nUnder federal health privacy laws, patients must sign a standard permission form for providers to share their medical information for purposes of treatment and billing. Policies on sharing psychiatric notes vary.\nAt Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, for example, psychiatrists decide whether to put notes in a locked area of the record, which other doctors can see only if they provide written justification.\nAt Partners, patients can ask that notes be restricted, but the organization evaluates the requests on a case-by-case basis. In the case of Julie \u2014 who does not want her full name published because she\u2019s worried about being stigmatized \u2014 Partners eventually agreed to restrict access to the therapy notes written between 2002 and 2009. But the provider network would not automatically sequester future notes.\nJulie believed she should control who sees her psychiatrist\u2019s notes. \u201cThese are issues I haven\u2019t talked about to anyone . . . not even my closest friends,\u201d she said. As a result, she found a therapist outside the Partners system, who will not put notes in an electronic record.\nDr. JudyAnn Bigby, Patrick\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services, is overseeing what will be the first statewide \u201chealth information exchange,\u2019\u2019 which will enable providers in different networks to share patient records online \u2014 but only with patients\u2019 permission, she said.\nPatients will decide which records they are willing to share among providers, and the consent forms will be kept in a central database.

News24 has confirmed that Zungu signed a two-year contract in August 2010 with \"Shabeer Ahmed Essa trading as Financial Excellence\" that would, according to page five of the contract, see Essa being paid R274 165 a month.\nThat works out to at least R3.29m a year - more than the R2.75m President Jacob Zuma earns currently.\nThe two-year contract, a copy of which is in News24's possession, allowed for a further one-year extension.\nA new 2013 two-year contract signed by Zungu on October 29 of that year confirms that the previous contract was extended, meaning that Essa was paid at least a total of R9.87m over the three-year period.\nNot only that, the October 29 contract - a copy of which is also in News24's possession - back pays Essa for the two months (September and October 2013) that he was not contracted.\nAccording to the contract Essa would be paid for 80 hours of work per month at a rate of R2 415 an hour, excluding value added tax. That works out to R386 400 for those two months.\nFrom November 2013, the contract stipulates that he be paid R1 992 an hour excluding VAT according to annual rates set down by the Department of Public Service and Administration and is obliged to work at least four days a week.\nAt a contractual minimum of 16 eight-hour days worked every month Essa would have bagged at least R254 9"}

For the New England Revolution, who play 3,100 miles closer to Boston than Liverpool does.\nWhether or not they want to believe it, the Red Sox have a serious image problem, and though the soccer team may not affect whether or not the Red Sox are willing to spend big dollars on the free agent market, the perception of New England Sports Ventures (or the more traditional name, The Boston Red Sox) diving into the soccer end of the pool does nothing to help them re-gain the trust of the fans who they had in their back pocket not so long ago.\nBut the \u201calternative\u201d hats have moved on after three whole years without a parade, and what is left is the hard-core Red Sox fan base ready to pounce, showing the same angst and desire for accountability that it had leading up to 2004. Ratings are down. Interest has faded. And the Red Sox go and buy a soccer team.\nIt is the ultimate PR nightmare to misread your customer base. Based on their success and can do no wrong in this town over the better part of the decade, the Red Sox have seriously fallen into that category. Tom Werner is belittling Theo Epstein on the radio, Theo is comfortable with Jed Lowrie\u2019s WAR over MVP candidate Adrian Beltre, and Red Sox fans are force-fed soccer and racing news they have little-to-no interest in hearing on a daily basis.\nThe Red Sox can no longer approach business with the understanding that the public will buy whatever they are selling.

Why should we assume they aren\u2019t in other areas as well?\nThat\u2019s why when the Red Sox tell me the soccer team has nothing to do with the baseball team, I don\u2019t believe it. They refused to do anything last year at the trading deadline, Theo is rightfully pumping up the kids, and they just lost one of the best offensive catchers in baseball for pennies on the dollar. They\u2019re willing to award David Ortiz $12.5 million, but not the guy who carried them for stretches last season. Ortiz did the same, of course. As recently as 2007 even.\nEpstein\u2019s \u201cbridge\u201d comment gets a lot of unwarranted grief but the theory behind it is sound.

If another team decides to sign Lutz to an offer sheet, the Saints would then have a chance to match. If the Saints would refuse to match the offer, they would receive either a first round, second round or no compensation depending on the level they elected to tender Lutz.\nSaints head coach Sean Payton has deep trust in Lutz, and, at 24, he can be the kicker in New Orleans for a long time.

Parasport is generally divided into three broad disability groups: deaf people, people with physical disabilities and people with intellectual disabilities. Each group has its own history, organisation and approach and each group has made significant contributions to what is considered modern-day parasport.\nIn the 19th Century, research into parasport proved sporting activity was very important for the re-education and rehabilitation of people with a disability although it was not until 1924 that the first deaf sport - the 'Paris Silent Games' - took place. The Games were organised by the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (CISS) and eventually evolved into the modern Deaflympics which is today governed by the CISS.\nThe Paralympic movement truly began as recently as the 1940s, shortly after the end of World War II. With a large number of injured soldiers and civilians disabled during combat, parasport offered a fantastic method of treatment and rehabilitation.\nThe man behind the Paralympic movement was a German neurologist named Ludwig Guttmann, a leading pre-World War II neurologist. A huge believer in sport as a method of rehabilitation for the disabled, Guttmann establish the Stoke Mandeville Games on July 28th 1948 to coincide with the starting date of the Opening Ceremony of the 1948 Olympic Games in London. In so doing Guttmann brought about the first parasport competition for wheelchair athletes.\nIn 1952, Dutch ex-servicemen joined the movement and founded the International Stoke Mandeville Games Committee (ISMGF). The Stoke Mandeville Games were the precursor to the Paralympic Games which first officially took place in Rome in 1960.\nAt the Rome 1960 Paralympics, the competitive programme included eight parasport events considered beneficial and suitable for athletes with spinal cord injuries. These were Snooker, Fencing (foil or sabre), Javelin and Precision Javelin, Shot Put, Indian Club Throwing (throwing a baton), Men's Basketball and Swimming (Freestyle, Breaststroke and Backstroke). Other non-competitive parasport events at the Games were: Table Tennis (singles and doubles), Archery, Dart Archery and the Pentathlon (Archery, Swimming, Javelin, Shot Put and Club Throwing).\nThe sixties also saw the introduction of parasport for people with intellectual disabilities through the Special Olympics movement. This grew out of a series of summer camps organized by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, beginning in 1962. In 1968 the first international Special Olympics were held, in Chicago. Today, Special Olympics provide training and competition in a variety of sports for persons with intellectual disabilities.\nBy 1986, the International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) was formed to support elite competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This was established in contrast to the more participative 'sport for all' approach of Special Olympics.\nAthletes with intellectual disabilities were included in the Paralympic Games. However in 2000 INAS-FID athletes were banned from Paralympic competition after a cheating scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, where a number of athletes participating in intellectual disability events were revealed to not actually be disabled"}

Watt, eventually gained steam and dominated the second half of the game, finishing with eight tackles, three sacks, four quarterback hurries and three tackles for loss. He also beat Wheeler for a strip-sack fumble that Eli Manning fell on to preserve possession during Big Blue\u2019s 27-22 win.\nWheeler, however, made a positive difference right off the bat, too, teaming with right guard Patrick Omameh and tight end Evan Engram to open a hole on Saquon Barkley\u2019s opening-drive 15-yard touchdown run. It looked a lot like some of Wheeler\u2019s solid work in his last start, Week 17 of last season, when he had replaced Flowers on the left side.\nWheeler, an undrafted second-year pro out of USC, and the former first-round pick Flowers had split reps in practice throughout the week until Shurmur tabbed Wheeler as starter on Saturday.\nManning gave a thumbs up to Wheeler\u2019s performance and liked how Shurmur called plays early to acclimate the new tackle, one of two new starters on the line with center John Greco.\nFlowers, 24, on the other hand, rushed out of the locker room postgame without talking to reporters.\nIn Week 17 last season under interim coach Steve Spagnuolo, Flowers was benched and Bobby Hart was released for reportedly refusing to play. Wheeler took Flowers\u2019 spot at left tackle and helped the Giants beat Washington behind a season-high 260 rushing yards.\nFlowers, the Giants\u2019 ninth overall pick in 2015, had done nothing the first two weeks to instill confidence. He was as big a liability at right tackle as he had been at left tackle for the first three years of his career.\nThis season, GM Dave Gettleman moved Flowers to the right side but the experiment already failed. Manning was sacked six times last Sunday night in Dallas, fumbling the ball away once. There were plenty of culprits, including fullback Shane Smith, who Gettleman promptly released on Wednesday for his two sacks allowed.\nBut Flowers has been to blame plenty and couldn\u2019t be relied upon in this big a spot in Houston.\nGettleman should have moved on from Flowers this offseason, or at least not handed him a starting job without much competition. The Giants reportedly were open to trading Flowers during April\u2019s draft but wanted a mid-round pick in return, and no team would pay that price.\nFlowers had started 48 of 50 regular season games since the Giants drafted him, but the experiment ended Sunday. It took the Giants\u2019 season being on the line to make it happen. But they finally did it.\nInterestingly enough, the Houston Texans\u2019 right tackle ended up being the biggest liability at that position Sunday. Julien Davenport committed five penalties, three false starts and two holds. Only one of them offset with a Giants penalty. One negated a Deshaun Watson TD pass to DeAndre Hopkins.\nThis preseason, Shurmur played Wheeler at right tackle to get him acclimated for just this type of situation. Left tackle"}

Addresses linked to the firm lead to mail drops. It has no website. No phone number. Not even the California lawyer who incorporated the company knew who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has found that this firm is run by an unlikely foreign political operative.\nFederal Election Commission filings show that SarahPAC has paid the company, Paideia Research LLC, at least $16,000 for its services.

In addition to the local Wyoming address, these records list another in southern California. That address, in turn, traces to another mail forwarding service. Paideia\u2019s corporate filings also indicate that it is managed by Pyramid Management LLC, which belongs to a California-based ex-lawyer and realtor, David DeLoach, who specializes in setting up untraceable LLCs and pre-fab shell companies in Wyoming and Nevada\u2014states that don\u2019t tax corporate income and have exceedingly lax disclosure rules.\nIn a brief phone interview, DeLoach said he vaguely remembered setting up Paideia. But as his website promises, the entire process was confidential.

In addition to letting some officers off the hook, others said the system was arbitrary and used to penalize those who criticized department practices.\nCouncil member Donovan Richards, chair of the public safety committee, told BuzzFeed News he plans to introduce the bill because he \u201cwants to see more predictability\u201d in the disciplinary process.\nSeveral other departments, including those in Newark, New Jersey; Phoenix; and Portland, Oregon, have adopted disciplinary matrices in recent years following complaints from officers and the community that police departments were not effectively combating misconduct.\nThe New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates complaints against officers in four categories \u2014 \u201cforce, abuse of authority, discourtesy, and offensive language\u201d \u2014 recently began its own pilot program to help standardize its discipline recommendations. Its guidelines outline certain offenses that warrant the most severe action, such as chokeholds, strip searches, and excessive force. For less serious offenses, it takes into consideration other factors, such as the nature of the offense, the officers\u2019 years of service, rank, command, and any other prior disciplinary history. The framework is not binding in the event that the board determines there were extenuating circumstances. Ultimately, the Civilian Complaint Review Board has no control over an officer\u2019s penalty, which is determined by the police commissioner.\nThe bill is likely to meet pushback from some police unions.\n\u201cThis bill takes an absolutely wrong approach to creating a fairer disciplinary system, because that isn\u2019t the sponsor\u2019s goal. A fair system tailors disciplinary consequences to fit the totality of circumstances, including the officer\u2019s past record. Instead, the \u2018matrix\u2019 proposed by this bill would likely result in more arbitrary discipline,\u201d said Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the largest NYPD union, in a statement.\nThe proposal does not prohibit the inclusion of an officer\u2019s record as a factor in making disciplinary decisions. In response to follow-up questions about whether the union would support any kind of disciplinary matrix, it declined to comment further.\nEarlier this year, Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill announced the creation of an independent panel of former federal prosecutors to scrutinize the disciplinary process. The panel is expected to release its report in January.\n\u201cThe NYPD will review the legislation closely, and continue to collaborate with the City Council on these critical issues,\u201d said NYPD spokesperson Phil Walzak.\nIf the legislation passes, the department will have 90 days to report back to the mayor and city council on the feasibility of implementing an internal disciplinary matrix."}

{"idx": "7153", "prompt": "Continue the following text: New research highlights the challenges faced by European capital goods manufacturers in their transition toward service-oriented business models.\nWithin the fiercely competitive global market, manufacturers are under increased pressure to differentiate their businesses. A major route to achieve this involves \u2018servitisation\u2019, the transformation from traditional business models (BMs) to new service-oriented BMs. During this process, companies shift their focus from product-centric offerings to services and solutions. This is done in an effort to increase and provide steady revenues and to build sustainable competitive advantage.\nBut is this trend gaining momentum among European capital goods manufacturers? In order to analyse the uptake, a team of researchers carried out a survey as part of the EU-funded (T-REX) project. They presented their findings in the \u2018International Journal of Engineering Business Management\u2019.\nThe researchers argue that servitisation implies \u201cnot only a redesign of the value proposition but also companies\u2019 need to reshape their business models.\u201d They add: \u201cHowever, manufacturers undertaking such a shift face numerous challenges that may lead to the so-called service paradox.\u201d When there is such a paradox, substantial investment in adding services to the existing product portfolio doesn\u2019t generate the expected higher returns.\nThe survey, which covered around 100 manufacturers, investigated the degree of service orientation of BMs of capital goods manufacturers that operate in the automation (e.g. system integrators, robot manufacturers), machinery (e.g. machine tools, packaging machines, textile machines) and transportation (e.g. forklifts, earth-moving machines) sectors. The respondents, operating mainly in Germany and Italy, were classified according to their size: micro and small (25 %), medium (29 %) and large (46 %). The survey\u2019s reference framework included various aspects of the new BMs to become more service-oriented. These were value proposition, customer segments, customer relationships, service delivery channels, key resources and activities, partnerships, revenue model and cost structure.\nThe survey found that the adoption of service-oriented BMs was still low in the analysed sectors, particularly in the automation and machine tools industries, where revenues are still dominated by product sales, with services representing only 20 %. \u201cAlthough the majority of respondents believe that the importance of service business will increase in future (86 % of the total), only 68 % of them claim that services are already an important part of their company\u2019s business,\u201d the researchers noted. They emphasised that information systems and ICTs still have unexploited potential, especially in SMEs. The survey also concluded that customer relationships are transaction-based and that customers are perceived as an obstacle rather than an incentive to offer new service-oriented BMs.\nThe T-REX (Lifecycle Extension Through Product Redesign and Repair, Renovation, Reuse, Recycle Strategies For Usage&Reusage-Oriented Business Models) project worked to develop conceptual tools to implement and experiment through three industrial application cases. It created a new business platform to offer capital goods as new product-service systems. Through the three validated demonstrators in forklift trucks, machine tools and robot solutions, T-REX demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to create new service-oriented BMs. These can achieve up to 84 % of component reuse, a life-cycle extension in the range of 30-100 %, and a reduction of maintenance service costs by 27-36 %."}

During the previous year, when Bernhardt left the firm to join the Trump administration as deputy secretary, it collected a total of $3.5 million in Interior-related revenue.\nBy comparison, the firm\u2019s total income to lobby Interior in 2016 was $1.2 million. During all but one year going back to 2009, BHFS\u2018s Interior-related revenue never broke seven figures.\nNow Bernhardt is President Trump\u2019s pick to run the Interior Department. The striking uptick in the amount of lobbying revenue could provide fuel to Bernhardt\u2019s critics as he heads toward a confirmation vote before a Senate committee on Thursday. The former lobbyist on energy and water issues is already under scrutiny by Democratic lawmakers, advocates and the agency\u2019s inspector general over his long list of former industry clients.\nIt\u2019s also a sign of how the revolving door between industry and government is still spinning two years after Trump won the presidency with a mantra to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests.\n\u201cAny senator thinking of casting their vote for this nomination should take a long pause and closer look at his conflicts of interests before doing so,\u201d Jayson O\u2019Neill, deputy director of the liberal advocacy group Western Values Project, said in an email.\nThese yearly sums do not differentiate between money paid to BHFS to lobby Interior on a particular topic and money paid to lobby another part of the federal government, such as Congress, on the same issues.\nFor its part, BHFS said the firm\u2019s Interior-related revenue went up just as Trump entered office and kick-started new work on public lands. The firm said it saw a similar boost in clients focused on the Energy Department at the beginning of President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, after his administration offered new energy funding opportunities as part of its effort to stimulate the economy.\nInterior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said in an email that while the department cannot comment on the revenue of Bernhardt\u2019s former firm, the acting secretary clears all matters involving former clients with Interior ethics experts.\nOn Tuesday, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General confirmed that it was reviewing allegations that Bernhardt violated the Trump administration\u2019s ethics pledge by working on California water policies that could affect the Westlands Water District \u2014 which is still a BHFS client \u2014 while in office.\nBernhardt denies that he improperly helped the large agricultural water district, and Interior ethics officials have said his work did not constitute a conflict.

The estimated damage to government property, including a runway light, is valued at about $3.7 million.\nAccording to the report, the crash was caused by a student pilot's failure to recognize the aircraft's speed was too low for the weather conditions and aircraft configuration. Insufficient speed during final approach caused a stall from which the student pilot and his instructor were unable to recover. This resulted in a hard landing that exceeded design limitations for the aircraft. Upon impact, the left wingtip dragged on the ground, causing the aircraft to leave the prepared runway surface and subsequently break apart. Unexpectedly difficult wind conditions at the field during the landing contributed to the mishap, officials said.\nThe MQ-1B Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned aircraft system. The Predator's primary missions are close air support, air interdiction, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR. It acts as a Joint Forces Air Component Commander-owned theater asset for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition in support of the Joint Forces Commander.\nThe MQ-1B Predator is a system, not just an aircraft. A fully operational system consists of four aircraft (with sensors and weapons), a ground control station, or GCS, a Predator Primary Satellite Link, or PPSL, and spare equipment along with operations and maintenance crews for deployed 24-hour operations.\nThe basic crew for the Predator is a rated pilot to control the aircraft and command the mission and an enlisted aircrew member to operate sensors and weapons plus a mission coordinator, when required. The crew employs the aircraft from inside the GCS via a line-of-sight data link or a satellite data link for beyond line-of-sight operations.\nThe MQ-1B Predator carries the Multi-spectral Targeting System, or MTS-A, which integrates an infrared sensor, a color/monochrome daylight TV camera, an image-intensified TV camera, a laser designator and a laser illuminator into a single package. The full motion video from each of the imaging sensors can be viewed as separate video streams or fused together. The aircraft can employ two laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles which possess a highly accurate, low collateral damage, and anti-armor and anti-personnel engagement capability.\nThe system can be deployed for worldwide operations. The Predator aircraft can be disassembled and loaded into a container for travel. The ground control system and PPSL are transportable in a C-130 Hercules (or larger) transport aircraft. The Predator can operate on a 5,000 by 75 foot (1,524 meters by 23 meters) hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to the ground data terminal antenna. The antenna provides line-of-"}

Today, the tallest structure in ancient times has long disappeared, but the deer statues, where the colossus once stood, remain guarding Mandraki Harbour.\nHistory's all over the place on the largest of the Dodecanese islands, with the Crusaders as well as Ottoman and Italian invaders having left their lasting legacy in Rhodes's Old Town. Further afield, the whitewashed villages, cobblestoned streets and beachfront tavernas are quintessentially Greek.\nWhen visiting a new place I like to get up high for a first overview \u2013 be it a castle tower, skyscraper or mountaintop. In Rhodes, the ruins of the acropolis dominating the western part of the city fit my bill.\nAfter a decent uphill walk in some 90\u00b0F weather, I stood in front of the remains of the Temple of Apollo. As always when encountering monuments of times long gone by, I felt reverence and admiration for the achievements of generations past.\nThe whole acropolis has not been excavated yet, but a small theatre and stadium below were open to the public. A local man was running circles in the stadium like his ancestors some hundreds of years ago.\nRhodes city walls and harbor.\nThanks to a strategic position in the Aegean Sea, Rhodes's Old Town has been an important seafaring and trading center since its beginnings in 407 B.C. It's surprisingly well-preserved despite a tumultuous history, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.\nWhile strolling aimlessly through the well-worn streets, in every alley, around every corner, I discovered something new: bastions, thick gates, minarets, fountains, churches and busy squares. The cobblestoned Street of the Knights, one of the best-preserved medieval streets in Europe, was crowded with tourists.\nPalace of the Grand Master courtyard.\nThe Palace of the Grand Master was arguably my highlight of Old Town. Originally a Byzantine fortress, it was converted into a residence in the 14th century by the Knights of St John. The building was destroyed in 1856 by a large gunpowder explosion, only to be rebuilt in the 20th century as a holiday residence for Fascist ruler Benito Mussolini, among others.\nIf there's one can't-miss site on Rhodes, it has to be the remains of the acropolis of L\u00edndos (top). After about an hour bus trip from Rhodes Old Town, I emerged at L\u00edndos village.\nThe walk in the shade on narrow cobbled streets and along cubic whitewashed houses and Byzantine churches passed rather quickly, and before long I had reached the ancient site. A natural watchtower facing the open sea, the acropolis was built on a steep rock, high above sea level. I stood for awhile and took in the stunning 360\u00b0 views over the village, olive groves and turquoise sea.\nThe acropolis covers a number of different monuments from various time periods, and it took me around two to three hours to get a good look at all of them"}

But for Word Odyssey, I prefer common, everyday words, words we take for granted, but which carry a rich history that is not commonly known. Now, there\u2019s hardly an American English word more common than dollar. Day in and day out, dollars fly in and out of our wallets\u2014mostly out, it seems. But what the heck is the origin of that word? The \u201cdoll\u201d in dollar doesn\u2019t sound like anything familiar, except a plastic toy baby, which wouldn\u2019t be a likely candidate to have led to the ubiquitous unit of American currency. And the \u201car\u201d ending of dollar isn\u2019t a very common suffix, either.\nSo what\u2019s up with the dollar? Here\u2019s the story\u2026..\nIn the mountains of Bohemia that separate Germany and the Czech Republic there is a splendid valley\u2014in German, \u201cthal\u201d means valley, which shares a root with the English dale\u2014known as Joachimstal. That name comes from St. Joachim, who was named in the apocryphal Gospel of James\u2014which is not included in the Bible\u2014as the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. After silver was discovered in the hills surrounding Joachimstal, in 1516 Count von Schlick, a local strongman, began minting silver coins with St. Joachim pictured on one side. These coins soon became known as \u201cJoachimstaler Groschen\u201d, with \u201cgroschen\u201d meaning \u201cunit.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a mouthful, so before you can say Joachimstaler these coins came to be called simply thalers.\nSilver thalers circulated throughout Europe. In England the spelling and pronunciation was Anglicized to dollars. Other European nations minted their own silver coins, similar in size and shape to the thaler. One such coin was the Spanish piece of eight, which was minted in Mexico and South America, and which became widespread as an international currency. In the English-speaking world, these pieces of eight were called \u201cSpanish dollars\u201d, and were the most popular form of currency in England\u2019s North American colonies. In fact, during the American revolution, Spanish dollars were used to back paper currency issued by the Continental Congress. So naturally, when the United States was established, the currency was given the familiar name dollar, and it\u2019s been known as that ever since.\nBut what about that ubiquitous dollar sign: $, which looks like a capital \u201cS\u201d with two vertical bars through it? There are several stories as to how that came about, but the two most likely explanations revolve around the Spanish dollar. The coat of arms of the Spanish Holy Roman Emperor Charles V included the twin pillars of Hercules, which were entwined with an \u201cS\u201d shaped ribbon. This coat of arms was depicted on the reverse side of the Spanish dollars.\nOne theory is that the dollar sign derived from a shorthand notation for these twin pillars, with the \u201cS\u201d shaped ribbon turned right side up. A second, better documented theory is that the dollar sign comes from a shorthand for pesos, which was symbolized with a \u201cP\u201d with an \u201cs\u201d beside it\u2014overlap those two letters and you get something like $.\nIn either case, $ first appears in the 1770\u2019s. After the U.S. was established, in short order the dollar sign became the customary symbol of the almighty dollar.\nAs a coda, I\u2019m going to return"}

Their track record is amazing, and from the iPhone to iPad, MacBook Air to the app store, the company has, without a doubt, the highest batting average in the entire business world, let alone that of tech.\nBut not even Apple can hit a home run every time, and every once in a while turns in a bloop single such as iTunes Radio (before Beats), the first generation Apple TV and last year's attempt at a native podcast app.\nWhere will HomeKit fall on Apple's field of dreams? Even if you are only a casual observer of the smart home industry, you know most expect a big hit. It's this year's biggest story in the space, even though it's yet to happen. The excitement for HomeKit is palpable, with the entire industry waiting to see if Apple's effort to bring the company's trademark simplicity and straightforwardness to the smart home will create a new golden age for the connected home and, finally, bring home automation to the mainstream consumer.\nIt's a lot to expect of an effort that, according to my sources, Apple itself has fairly modest expectations for out of the gate. It also led me to think about what would happen if HomeKit fails to meet expectations. Not that I expect it to - in fact, I expect Apple and HomeKit to eventually be a very important part of the broader smart home - but I do think it's worth at least considering what could make Apple's foray into smart home fall drastically short of expectations.\nApple's motivation behind HomeKit is it wants to make iOS devices the central control point for the smart home. In other words, make switching costs to another operating system even higher.\nMost of us are ok with locking ourselves further into the Apple ecosystem, but a part of the bargain is that we get something in return. That something with HomeKit is a simpler, most cohesive smart home, a smart home that simply works without heavy installation, expensive subscription fees and more. But if Apple's effort here is something akin to, let's say, iTunes for most of the past decade (a pretty clunky piece of software), then there's a chance it could actually be more difficult and consumers decide to stay away.\nAs we all know, when entering new product categories Apple likes to own the \"full stack\", which often means creating their own ecosystem and inviting others to join. In the smart home, such an approach is impossible since openness and interoperability across various device types is required.\nIn fact, if there's one consistent theme that I've been hearing from smart home execs the last few months, it's that the industry needs to embrace openness and interoperability if this industry is to ever deliver on its promise. These folks know a bunch of competing standards and proprietary products from companies with clashing agendas will cause significant harm and delay the adoption of the technology as consumers tune out.

{"idx": "7164", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In a decision that could affect hundreds of condominium owners, a state appeals court has upheld a West Hollywood law prohibiting the conversion of apartment buildings to condominiums without the city's approval.\nThe Court of Appeal directed a lower court to issue a restraining order barring future condominium conversions that violate a ban that has been in effect since West Hollywood became a city in 1984.\nThe three-judge panel's unanimous ruling left unresolved the outcome of scores of conversions that occurred after cityhood, saying that West Hollywood officials are best equipped to deal with the \"variety of problems\" the conversions pose.\nElated city officials interpreted the ruling as giving them control over what happens to 30 buildings with a total of about 600 units, many of which have been sold to people whose property rights appear to be clouded.\n\"We fought for cityhood to make our own land-use decisions, to protect tenants and to promote and retain affordable housing, and this court decision reaffirms our right to do those things,\" Mayor Abbe Land said.\nNews of the decision was greeted with shock by condo owners who bought their properties after the law was enacted, and whose purchases are now in question.\n\"It's outrageous to imply that we might not really own our properties,\" said Eric Brown, who bought his condo at 1351 Crescent Heights Blvd. last year rather than move after the owners decided to convert the building.\n\"The irony is, I did everything possible to try to stop this conversion,\" said Brown, who was a tenant in the building for 10 years. \"And the same City Hall that told me it was too late, that the conversion was a fait accompli, is now suggesting they may question the rightful ownership of my property?\"\nLawyers for various owners of the buildings said they intend to ask the appeals court to rehear the case. Failing that, they said, they will appeal to the state Supreme Court.\n\"The consequences (of the ruling) can be mind-boggling,\" said Craig Mordoh, one of the lawyers.\nThe ban on conversions began as a moratorium imposed by the newly elected City Council the day West Hollywood became a city in 1984. The council followed up with an ordinance in 1986 that prohibited the owners of apartment buildings from converting rental units without obtaining conditional-use permits from the city.\nAfter the owners went ahead with the conversions, citing permission from the county prior to cityhood, the city went to court in a bid to halt the sales. But on three occasions, Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the building owners.\nCity officials estimate that about 100 apartments were sold as condos after the law was enacted. Lawyers for owners of some buildings converted to condominiums say the figure is much higher.\n\"It is our position that all of the units in all of the buildings where no sales occurred before incorporation are apartment units as a matter of law,\" City Atty. Michael Jenkins said.\nAs for people who have bought condos and are living in them, he said: \"We want to deal with that on a case-by-case basis. We're not anxious to create a situation where we're throwing people out of their condominiums. On the other hand, these are apartments, they're not condominiums, and they should never have been sold.\"\nStephen L. Jones, a lawyer representing several of the building owners, predicted there would be chaos if the city prevails and challenges the property rights of people who"}

If they seek a space-saving solution that incorporates advanced onscreen pen input, though, the field until now has narrowed a whole lot more: to Microsoft's Surface Studio line. That changes at CES 2019, with the introduction of Lenovo's Yoga A940, a creator-friendly all-in-one PC that starts at a much lower price for its base model ($2,349) than the Studio's does, and does some things the Studio AIOs can't.\nThe Yoga A940 does its own form of Yoga-flexing. The 27-inch panel (which comes in 1440p or 4K varieties, both with Dolby Vision HDR support) can stand upright like any conventional AIO does, as you see here, but it also lowers, bottom-first, to a shallow angle for drafting work, sketching, and editing media using Lenovo's included active pen. The dial you see protruding from the left side (much more on that in a moment) is not part of the hinge but a special control, the Precision Dial, that lets you scroll selections, menus, data, and more with a wrist twist.\nHere, you can see the hinge mechanism and another view of the Dial. The back of the Yoga A940 is clean and tidy enough that you wouldn't mind this end facing out into an open work space or other high-visibility spot in an appearances-conscious office.\nThis grille extends across the front face of the base portion, covering the speaker bank. The base behind it contains the whole of the core components for the system.

{"idx": "7171", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As long-standing readers of this blog know, I have not always been a Catholic; I embraced Catholicism in 2004 after a Protestant upbringing and then about a seven-year stint in which I followed a neopagan spiritual path. Indeed, I wrote a number of books about paganism, a fact I discussed in an earlier blog post, You Wrote Books About Paganism? These days, my work as a writer is primarily geared toward Christians, but I do not consider myself hostile to paganism (the Catholic tradition has always taught, even before Vatican II, that Catholics should respect what is good and true and beautiful in other religious traditions).\nBut just because I am not hostile to paganism, does not mean that I do not have opinions about paganism \u2014 including some criticisms. Today\u2019s post, inspired by an email I received from a reader recently, looks at some of those criticisms. The reader wrote to me because a friend of hers, who is a Christian, is exploring magic and witchcraft, and she is not sure how to respond to this. So she turned to me for my thoughts on that question.\nI have a dear friend who is a follower of Christ and also has a fascination with magic and witchcraft. At this point, they have not pursued their interest but I know it continues to be a draw for them. I was just wondering if you have any concerns, thoughts, or wisdom to share concerning whether or not a Christian should pursue the magic arts. I personally don\u2019t have any experience with this and feel it would be helpful to seek wisdom from someone who does. I care about this person deeply and don\u2019t want them to get hurt. Thank you for your time!\nThanks for reaching out. Many Christians find magic and witchcraft interesting or appealing. I imagine there are many reasons why this is so. By the same token, other Christians are drawn to explore Hinduism or Buddhism or other traditional religions. All of this falls under the umbrella terms \u201cinterfaith dialogue\u201d or \u201cinter-religious dialogue\u201d or \u201cinterspirituality.\u201d I do believe God calls some of us to function like bridges between the different faith traditions, in the interest of promoting understanding and unity as much as we are able. There are very real cultural and values differences between the different faith traditions, that should not be glossed over. Even so, it\u2019s important to remember that we are all human beings, we share the same planet, and it is important we learn how to love one another, without violence and without constantly trying to control or change each other.\nBut to your specific question. I think the first question your friend needs to wrestle with: are they thinking about leaving Christianity altogether? It\u2019s one thing to be a Christian with a lively interest in another tradition (like I described above), and another thing to change one\u2019s spiritual path altogether. I think having clarity about their intentions (which may mean doing some deep inner work, so that they are aware of what is driving them, even subconsciously) is really important. God loves us whether we remain Christian or not, but of course the decision to change one\u2019s spiritual path should not be made lightly, as it can have real repercussions with one\u2019s family and social network.\nIf your friend is clear that they want to remain Christian, but still wants to learn more about magic and witchcraft, then I would recommend reading a few books on the topic. Ronald Hutton\u2019s The Triumph of the Moon is very important; it\u2019s academic but easy to read, and it is the most balanced and in-depth history of modern witchcraft and paganism that I have come across.

Franklin, meanwhile, drubbed KLAA East rival Livonia Stevenson, 49-7, to win its third straight. This will be a match-up of left-handed gun-slinging quarterbacks in Churchill's Drew Alsobrooks and Franklin's Jake Kelbert. The two teams split last year and this is the 50th all-time meeting between the two rivals, with Franklin leading the series, 33-16.

Not much was going on, besides some lawmakers recognizing visitors to the state capitol. Still, he felt excited. He looked at the floor of the chamber and envisioned himself, standing there in 10 months.\nMoore had just qualified to run against State Rep.

Almost immediately, someone back home noticed his name on the secretary of state's website, as a new candidate. His phone rang.\nAmong the callers? Some of his old Dade County High School teachers. It was hard to believe Moore was a political candidate. It seemed like just yesterday he was graduating.\nTo be more precise, it was six years ago that he was graduating. Moore is only 24. But he believes he can unseat Deffenbaugh and make a quick impact in the legislature.\n\"The pace that Mr. Deffenbaugh operates in at the state capitol is just too slow,\" Moore said. \"To be a loud voice in Dade and Walker county, we need someone who can take a fast pace and fight in the legislature.\"\nHe said Deffenbaugh's record \u2014 or rather, his lack of a record \u2014 shows that voters should usher in a change. Since taking office in 2013, Deffenbaugh has been the lead sponsor of six bills. Of those, three were local acts for the city and county governments he represents, which just about always pass in the legislature without questions from fellow lawmakers.\nOf the other three bills, the House did not vote on two of them. The third passed the House this year, 150-1. It is a bill to add a 16th member to the Georgia Board of Public Safety.\nAsked about Moore's challenge, about the need for a representative who moves faster and talks louder and fights, Deffenbaugh said Friday, \"We'll see. I don't know. If he can do it faster, he ought to be the one doing it.\"\nHe doesn't know Moore. But when he learned of his new challenger, Deffenbaugh said he emailed him, inviting Moore to shadow him at the Capitol for a day later this month. If Moore beats him in the election in May, Deffenbaugh figures, the new guy will be more prepared to take office. And if Deffenbaugh wins? At least they get to spend some time together.\n\"We're going to be friends,\" Deffenbaugh said. \"There's no reason why we shouldn't.\"\nHe added: \"If you have never tried anything before, you're not sure what it takes to do something.

But there are several forces at work that are directing digital marketing operations to rethink their roles in driving revenue for their organization. The current worldwide economic environment is one obvious driver. In fact, a recent survey of 300 executives at Fortune 500 companies clearly indicated that revenue growth is top-of-mind for CEOs. If revenue growth is on the mind of your CEO, it needs to be on the minds of the CMO and his digital marketing team.\nOverall, marketing is being tasked with becoming a revenue generation arm. Marketing is no longer just about awareness and brand; marketing has to prove itself as an important part of the engine that generates revenue.\nThat business outcome might be something as simple as a sale, if you sell products through your website. A business outcome might be a page view if you are an advertiser. A business outcome might be an application or admission if you are an educational institution.

However you think about your business, if you connect four steps -- content, context, experience and optimization -- your site will deliver more business outcomes, which will ultimately deliver more revenue.\nMaking the connection between content and revenue is done by building on those four concepts. By following those steps you will deliver more business outcomes, which ultimately impacts your top line and makes your digital marketing efforts -- and you -- a revenue generation superstar for your organization.\nContent is the core building block of how to deliver business outcomes on a website or a mobile device or any channel -- landing pages, and microsites created by your marketing organizations. News articles, if you are a publisher. Product pages, if you are a retailer. Content comes in many forms, and being able to manage content is an important mission for any digital marketing organization.\nWeb Content Management provides a platform that helps digital marketers empower content authors to more effectively publish content to each digital channel. The benefit of having a Web Content Management engine at the core of your digital marketing strategy is that you are able to empower your organization to be able to be more agile in how they publish content out to multichannel environments, like websites, mobile devices, and social networks.\nAfter content comes context, a really important element that most organizations don\u2019t think about when they think about their digital marketing strategy. Context is basically an understanding of the circumstances that surround why a customer is interested in doing business with you.\nContext is that understanding of who your audience is, what motivates them, what compels them to take action on your site, and how they get to your site. If content is king, then context is its queen, and you have to think about both ruling together for a full digital marketing experience.\nContext comes in many different forms. When someone comes to a website or to your Facebook page, via desktop or mobile device, you are able to gain a lot of context about that visitor by seeing what products they are interested in, by their click paths, their visit patterns, perhaps how often they come to your site; previous purchases they may have made on your site, marketing campaigns they may have responded to.\nYou can also learn a lot about your visitors by looking at the environment, which includes things like their location.

Chuck Payne told the audience he has raised his family on the south end of Whitfield County, where many Latino residents live. He said he coached the children in sports. He calls his neighbor a \"redneck Latino.\"\n\"I know young men and women who have grown up here in Whitfield County,\" he said. \"I don't know their parents' legal status. But they are Georgians. And these kids, they're as Georgian as anybody else and as Georgian as my kids.\"\nPayne, R-Dalton, said Congress needs to pass a long-term solution for Dreamers, immigrants who came to the United States illegally but have received temporary protection through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an initiative under President Barack Obama. Pressed further during Thursday's forum about whether these students should receive the HOPE scholarship, Payne did not make a commitment either way.\nBut when asked by the Times Free Press after the event, Payne said, \"If it were up to me, I'd be for it.\"\nHis opponent, Democrat Michael Morgan, said during the forum that he supported using the scholarship for Dreamers.\n\"This is your home,\" he said. \"I think we ought to give you a path to citizenship, and I think we ought to educate you. They're coming through our school systems, and they're good students.\"\nPayne's answer on the issue bucks his party's orthodoxy this year, as the debate over the use of the HOPE scholarship for Dreamers has become a major issue between the state's candidates for governor. After Democrat Stacey Abrams said Dreamers should qualify for the HOPE scholarship during a visit to Dalton in July, Republican Brian Kemp attacked her in an ad, telling the viewer, \"She says it's their right; I say it's just wrong.\"\nBut unlike other portions of rural northwest Georgia, Whitfield County has a significant Latino population. About 70 percent of Dalton Public Schools' students are Latino. Dalton State, meanwhile, became a Hispanic Serving Institution earlier this year, opening the college up to more federal grants.\nPayne and Morgan will face each other for the District 54 seat in the Nov. 6 election.

In court filings, the state has noted that if the court finds that the Iddings have legal title to the tidelands, the state can still take them without compensating the Iddings, since for decades the public has harvested on those tidelands.\nState lawmakers this month have filed bills in the Senate and House of Representatives that would restrict how the state goes about acquiring lands through this process, known as adverse possession.

This wasn't a complete surprise to me (or anyone in the audience I would guess) since Volkswagen has been capturing a lot of \"green\" awards for the clean diesel Jetta, including the 2009 Green Car of the Year awarded by the Green Car Journal. David Warrilow, Sales Operations Manager for CO, NM and UT, accepted the award on behalf of Volkswagen and thanked the RMAP for recognizing the 2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI. He went on to say, \"It is a bit of a conundrum and a paradox that a diesel car is getting all of the environmental car of the year awards.\" I am sure other manufacturers in the crowd were biting their tongues.\nWith the success of Volkswagen's clean diesel technology, what about hybrids you ask? So far the only confirmed Hybrid will be the 2010 Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid (most likely sharing the Porsche Cayenne platform) that is supposed to achieve 328 hp and tip the meters at 26 mpg. However, there has been some speculation that VW will deliver a 2010 Jetta Hybrid and down the road a Passat Hybrid in 2011, though these reports haven't been confirmed. Other awards were given to Dodge for the 2009 Dodge Challenger RT/SRT8 as RMAP Car of the Year and the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 as the RMAP Truck of the Year. The RMAP SUV of the Year Award went to Ford for the 2009 Ford Flex.Bottom-line, Volkswagen deserves credit for producing a superior clean diesel product that the public can't seem to get enough of (good luck finding a bunch on a VW lot) and it highlights just how new the \"green\" technology is in the market. So stay tuned because we are going to see new advancements very quickly and new ways ideas for how to implement \"green\" technology, for example, the Lightning Hybrids LH4 hydraulic-biodiesel drivetrain announced this year at the 2009 Denver Auto Show.Allsmallcars.com has new and used car information, photos and more.

Some cite the spin-off of Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific testing and measurement gear considered HP\u2019s most innovative business, in 2000 as a misfire.\nWhitman, former vice president of strategic planning at Disney, who attained celeb status as eBay's hard-charging CEO from 1998 to 2008, acknowledges the challenge of reversing a horrific stretch of big deals gone sour (such as HP's troubled $10.3 billion acquisition of enterprise software company Autonomy in 2011) and a revolving door of CEOs before her (Carly Fiorina, Leo Apotheker, Mark Hurd). \"There were quite different strategies from the CEOs before me,\" she says. \"It's like ice skating, where you're in the middle of a group of people and being whipped around.\"\nHow ambitious is this split? Few in tech history have been attempted on this scale. It\u2019s tantamount to changing the engine on a car hurtling down a freeway without slowing down.\nThe newly constituted HP has the organizational chops to pull it off, Dutkowsky contends.

Shockingly, the Apple iPad debuted less than five years ago and it hasn't taken long for it and Android tablets \u2014 and now Windows-based models \u2014 to revolutionize the world of mobile computing.\nSo how does your department get into the tablet game? The following are some guidelines to help your department's leadership make the best purchasing decision for your organization.\nWill the tablet spend its life on fire apparatus responding to calls for service or will it be in the hands of a fire inspector on a daily basis as they conduct fire-prevention duties?\nThis is a key question as the cost difference between an average rugged tablet (engineered for the rough and tumble world of emergency responses) and an average business-worthy tablet can be $2,000 or more. For the purposes of this discussion, we're going to focus on the latter.\nTablets have come a long way in a short time. It probably won't be too long before their functionality replaces computers and smartphones, but they're not quite there yet. Even with add-ons, such as a Bluetooth connected keyboard, tablets still present an ergonomic challenge when it comes to some tasks like entering large amounts of text or working with graphics.\nConvertible tablets, like the various Windows 8 models, are quickly closing the productivity gap between desktop computers and tablets, and quality models are now on the market for under $1,000.\nSo before you get too far down the purchasing decision tree, put in the time to determine which members will be using the tablet and what jobs you want them to use the tablet for.\nIn many respects, buying a tablet is not much different than buying a desktop or notebook computer, so take a good look at your current computing system.\nApple with its iPads and Android with its many hardware choices from manufacturers such as Acer, Amazon, Asus, Samsung, and others offer many choices. The tablet market is also featuring affordable Windows 8 tablets built around Intel's Atom processor from various manufacturers.\nApple's iOS, the operating system on the iPad Air and iPad mini has two significant advantages: it's very clean and intuitive, and there is a wide selection of iPad apps that work uniformly well with very few exceptions. So if you're department is currently a Mac shop, you'll probably want to take a close look at having your tablets speaking the same language.\nTablets using Google's Android mobile OS offer a wide choice of hardware from several manufacturers and offer maximum configurability, a top-notch notification system, fast and smooth Web browsing, and seamless integration with Google applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and Hangouts for video chat.\nThe Android OS also includes support for multiple user logins enabling one tablet to be shared by several members. This is something to think about for volunteer or paid-on-call departments where different people may be sharing job responsibilities.\nMicrosoft's Windows 8 comes the closest to offering a traditional computing experience with full x86 support for all of your department's Windows software; you can run the full version of Microsoft Office when using a Windows 8 tablet. You'll also find that connectivity options and hardware add-ons for Windows models are typically more plentiful than with other tablet types.\nLook beyond Candy Crush or Angry Birds. You're looking to your tablets to improve the efficiency and effectiveness"}

The rally helped the market finish with a modest gain in November, but the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is still 5.8% away from the all-time high it set in late September.

It holds that peaceful compromise between Israel and the Palestinians will lead to a generally placid Middle East. But it's a false notion. One of its more famous advocates is Chuck Hagel, President Obama's nominee to be secretary of defense.\n\"The core of all challenges in the Middle East remains the underlying Arab-Israeli conflict,\" Hagel said in 2006. \"The failure to address this root cause will allow Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorists to continue to sustain popular Muslim and Arab support -- a dynamic that continues to undermine America's standing in the region and the Governments of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and others, whose support is critical for any Middle East resolution.\"\nAs Martin Kramer wrote: \"The vocabulary here -- 'core,' 'root cause,' 'underlying' -- is taken from the standard linkage lexicon, which elevates the Arab-Israeli or Palestinian-Israeli conflict to a preeminent status.\" He continued: \"It is this conflict, practically alone, that prompts the rise of terrorists, weakens friendly governments, and makes it impossible for the United States to win Arabs and Muslims over to the good cause.\"\nIn his 2008 book, \"America: Our Next Chapter,\" Hagel wrote that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"cannot be looked at in isolation. Like a stone dropped into a placid lake, its ripples extend out farther and farther. Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon feel the effects most noticeably. Farther still, Afghanistan and Pakistan; anything that impacts their political stability also affects the two emerging economic superpowers, India and China.\"\nI would love to hear Hagel's views on this subject today, because his theory of linkage -- and his belief that a Middle East freed from the Israeli-Palestinian dispute would be a \"placid lake\" -- has been utterly discredited by events. It is, of course, vital to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And it is true that some Islamist terrorist groups exploit the conflict as a recruiting tool. But these same terrorists are unalterably opposed to a compromise that would allow two states, Israel and Palestine, to live side by side, because they are opposed to the very existence of Israel. They try to subvert the peace process because they fear it will legitimize the existence of a country they hate.\nNever mind this technical detail. The past two years have proved the theory of linkage to be comprehensively false anyway.\nCome with me on a quick tour of the greater Middle East. The Syrian civil war? Unrelated to the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. The slow disintegration of Yemen? Unrelated. Chaos and violence in Libya? Unrelated. Chaos and fundamentalism in Egypt? The creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank would not have stopped the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, nor would it have stopped the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood. Terrorism in Algeria? Unrelated. The Iranian nuclear program? How would the creation of a Palestinian state have persuaded the Iranian regime to cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons? Someone please explain.

{"idx": "7236", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Businesses around the world and across the U.S. are coming to realize that many of the steps they\u2019re taking to reduce their environmental impact actually have a cost benefit for their company. But, as we explore in the examples below, going green and cost savings isn\u2019t always as straightforward as turning off the lights at night.\nHere are three ways businesses, large and small, are going green and saving money.\nThis is one of the most immediate and obvious ways businesses are lowering their impact and making significant cost savings. As fossil fuels increase in price and taxes on landfill go up, businesses are making changes to how they use energy and dispose of their waste to improve their bottom line.\nBut beyond the direct savings of cutting energy, waste and water, companies can save money from the reputation benefits of green behavior. As any company that invests in market research will know, a brand\u2019s reputation plays a big role in its success.\nThe more consumers become aware of the impact of what they buy, the greater the financial incentive for companies to ensure they\u2019re behaving responsibly throughout their business. For example, several years ago a leaked McKinsey and Co. study showed that nearly 10 percent of Walmart customers stopped shopping there because of the company\u2019s poor reputation (including its commitment to the environment).\nSourcing plays a particularly large role in the reputation and social success of a business. From logging in the rainforest to polluting the drinking water of poor communities and taking advantage of cheap labor, more and more businesses are finding it financially damaging to continue irresponsible business practices.\nFinally, going green isn\u2019t all about cutting back and giving things up \u2013 it\u2019s also about making socially-responsible investments. Changing traditional business habits to more low-impact alternatives, and investing in smart technology that makes this transition smoother and more attractive, is one way many businesses are going green. For example, investing in better communications technology to facilitate conference calls helps a company reduce the impact of traveling to meetings.\nTo reference GE again, the company doubled their 2005 budget for research and developing technology to reduce energy consumption and waste products to $1.5 billion. The return on investment is high: in 2005, their \u201cEcomagination\u201d line of products generated $10 billion and $18 billion in 2010.\nSo what does this mean for your business? By weaving environmentally-friendly practices into your business model, you can benefit not only by fulfilling your corporate responsibility, but also running a more effective and efficient business. From a consumer perspective, how can you determine if a business is green? Research the companies you shop with most and inquire as to their practices. By insisting on change, you will be doing your part in encouraging businesses to adopt green initiatives and help make our planet better.\nPaint your roof and your parking lot white. Reflecting some heat will save you $$$ in air conditioning.\nbusiness and green is an oxymoron.\nConsumer based culture is not the way to go."}

These smaller companies just have more room to grow.\nHowever, companies of this size can also be high-risk stocks if you consider their higher betas \u2014 or the stock\u2019s volatility in relation to the market. Smaller-cap companies have more room to grow, but they can also lose a large percentage of their value much more easily. So these are high-risk stocks, but that doesn\u2019t mean there are no small-cap stocks worth considering.\nHere are 5 small-cap stocks to buy \u2014 for investors that can handle high-risk stocks in exchange for possible high rewards.\nIn the biotechnology (and marijuana) sector, Cronos Group Inc.

CRON stock bottomed at $6.00 in August, but rocketed higher as markets priced in its positive prospects in the marijuana world. Cronos stock continued to go up when the company reported 428% year-over-year increase in sales in the second quarter. The company added 70,000 kg in capacity through its Cronos GrowCo JV. It also signed a five year take-or-pay supply agreement for 100,000 kg with Cura Cannabis Solutions.

Recently, Rite Aid\u2019s biggest shareholders did not express support for a merger with the Albertsons grocery chain, and management abandoned the deal. This sent RAD stock from $2.00 to a yearly low of $1.23.\nAnd RAD is definitely a high-risk stock.

Morton was instrumental in establishing that nurseries were selling vines infected with the fungus.\nWhile that established her fame among fungus enthusiasts, Morton's influence skyrocketed in recent years with the initial success of three high-profile Washington area clients: Black Ankle Vineyards and Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard in Maryland, and Boxwood Winery in Northern Virginia. She also consults for Chatham Vineyards on the Eastern Shore and Rosemont in southern Virginia, which won best of show at the Atlantic Seaboard Wine Competition in July for its Meritage. She has other clients who have not yet released wines.\nHer clients' accomplishments bolster Morton's argument that the herbaceous, underripe flavors that typically plague East Coast wines can be conquered through proper vineyard management.\n\"Everybody bought into this idea that we have a terrible climate to grow grapes,\" Morton says. \"Sure, we get hurricanes. What wine region doesn't get messed up once in a while? With canopy management, French clones and crop control, we are able to get nice fruit with ripe sugars - riper than we ever thought we could 10 years ago.\"\nThroughout the year, Morton can be found trudging through her clients' vineyards in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, followed by her constant companion, a Norwich terrier named Randy. She is looking for signs of mealy bugs, downy mildew, bunch rot or any number of afflictions that can prevent grapes from ripening. \"I like to wage war on green flavors,\" she said during a recent visit to Sugarloaf.\nA vineyard consultant of Morton's caliber can help budding vintners start on the right track without spending several vintages experimenting.

Let\u2019s put it this way \u2013 we way we gave them goals and the mistakes we made along the way, we have to be better.\"\nThe Bruins hope to have a better time of it for tonight\u2019s game against the Lightning at TD Garden (NESN, NBC Sports, WBZ-FM, 7:30 p.m.).\nThe Bruins are 1-2-0 against the Lightning, having lost the last two after beating Tampa in the second game of the season.\nTampa Bay comes in off a 5-3 win last night in Philadelphia, a game in which the Flyers outshot the Lightning, 38-15. The Lightning have won three straight, scoring 11 goals in that span. But it\u2019s likely too little, too late. With seven games left, Tampa Bay is seven points out of the playoffs, and probably needs to win out to even have a chance at a miracle playoff spot.\nThe offense isn\u2019t a problem for Tampa Bay, especially from their top lines. Steven Stamkos is the big name, and his game backs up the hype. His 53 goals lead the league and he\u2019s second with 88 points. Only three players have more points than Stamkos has goals.\nMartin St. Louis is having another good season with 24 goals and 68 points. Teddy Purcell is the third player to watch out for, with a career-high 60 points.\nAll three play on the same line, so expect to see Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg jump over the boards when that line plays. The Patrice Bergeron could also see time in that matchup.\nVincent Lecavalier (hand) is with the Lightning, but his status isn\u2019t clear for tonight."}

For the league's umpires, the minimum salary is $150,000 (plus quite a few perks), and the most experienced veterans can make $450,000 per year.\nBefore you quit your day job to try to get a piece of that pie, be forewarned\u2014the road to that much money is a long one that requires a lot of luck and hard work.\nAccording to MLB.com's \"How to Become an Umpire\" guide, the first step is to enroll in one of the nation's two umpiring schools approved by Minor League Baseball Umpire Development: the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School or the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy. Both schools are located along the eastern coast of Florida and offer annual programs that run for about a month from January into February.\nEach program charges a tuition of roughly $2,400. If you require room and board, it'll run closer to four grand.\nGot to spend money to make money, right?\nAt the conclusion of those courses, the top 15-20 percent of participants from each program are selected to take part in the Minor League Baseball Advanced Course, which runs for one week in mid-February. The other 80-85 percent paid a couple thousand bucks for a crash course in just how doggone difficult it is to be an MLB umpire.\nA handful of candidates who stand out in the advanced course will get assigned to rookie or Class A short-season leagues, which is where the journey truly begins.\nJust like the players, umpires need to work their way up through the minor leagues, which could take a decade or more. Also like the players, minor league umpires aren't exactly making it rain with their income. Per MiLB.com, umpires start out making $2,000-$2,300 per month in rookie and short-season leagues, and they can eventually earn up to $3,900 per month in Triple-A. Minor league umpires also get a per diem of up to $66 per day.\nThat pay is solely for the months they're umping games, though, and the minor league season runs for about five months. That means even the richest Triple-A umpires only have a salary of around $20,000. As such, until they get the call from the majors, most umpires work a second job (at least during the offseason) to help make ends meet.\nUnfortunately, even the best umpires are liable to languish at the Triple-A level for a long time because job turnover among MLB umpires is almost nonexistent. More than a dozen guys umped for at least three decades. Joe West has been doing it since 1976 and is one of three umpires in history to call at least 5,000 games.\nThe club of MLB umpires isn't quite as exclusive as the Supreme Court, but someone who's trying to break in has to"}

He said greater unity is need to address migration, banking union, the transition to renewable energy, digital technology and defence.\nAn EU-wide party similar to Mr Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche would bring together moderates from both left and right, as well as environmentalists.\nThe French president said contradictions within the European People\u2019s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, and the Party of European Socialists, are blocking progress.\nAn Italian correspondent took Mr Macron to task for comparing Mr Berlusconi to Mr Orb\u00e1n, the leader of an increasingly obstreperous bloc of former east European countries. Mr Macron said the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy, Berlusconi\u2019s allies in the March 4th Italian elections, were \u201cnot representative of Christian Democracy\u201d either.\n\u201cIn reality, the EPP is no longer a Christian Democratic party, but a combination of the Christian Democratic right and a more authoritarian, nationalist right,\u201d Mr Macron said.\nBut Mr Macron\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d looks increasingly fictional. Some analysts took the words \u201cbanned by the treaties\u201d to mean that France distinguishes between chlorine and neurotoxic sarin.

But if the Iraqi government condemns French citizens to death, Paris will attempt to have their sentences commuted to life in prison, Mr Macron said.\nTurning to domestic policies, Mr Macron said he was not concerned by polls showing that a strong majority of the population do not believe he will increase their purchasing power.\nChronic, structural unemployment of about 9 per cent in France was a \u201cscandal\u201d, Mr Macron continued. \u201cWe are the only great economy of Europe that has sunk into mass unemployment for the past three decades.\u201d After he spoke, the statistics institute Insee reported that French unemployment had fallen to 8.7 per cent, its lowest since 2009.\nMr Macron ended confusion about his plan to establish \u201cuniversal national service\u201d, saying it would be obligatory for men and women, civil or military, and would last from three to six months.\nMr Macron had promised there would be no one sleeping rough in France by the end of last year. \u201cWe failed because there are fragile populations not reached by public policies, and because there was strong migratory pressure,\u201d he said.\nMr Macron addressed accusations of sexual aggression against two of his cabinet ministers for the first time.

If one just counts the unarmed victims, that\u2019s a rate of about two extrajudicial executions per day, roughly twice the \u201cone every 28 hours\u201d cited by the Malcolm X Grassroots Network\u2019s 2012 report, Operation Ghetto Storm.\nGiven the odds against prosecution, officer Michael T. Slager probably counts himself the unluckiest white man in South Carolina. A neighborhood resident\u2019s phone camera captured Slager firing repeatedly into the back of 50 year-old Walter L. Scott, a Black North Charleston father of four with no criminal record who had been stopped for a minor traffic violation, tussled with the officer, and tried to run away.\nDespite his claims to have been in fear for his life, Slager was charged with murder \u2013 a fate he would surely have avoided had he been under the jurisdiction of St. Louis prosecutor Bob McCulloch. Last year, McCulloch\u2019s team led grand jurors to believe that \u201cthe law\u201d allowed police to use deadly force against unarmed persons fleeing a felony, as Ferguson officer Darren Wilson claimed was the case with Michael Brown. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such shootings unconstitutional in 1985, as every public defender knows \u2013 and McCulloch surely knew, as well. The South Carolina cop also had the bad judgment to commit murder in clear view of a private citizen\u2019s well-held camera.\nLast weekend in the town of Zion, Illinois, about 30 miles north of Chicago, cops killed 17-year-old Justus Howell with two shots to the back while he was running away, according to the coroner\u2019s office. Initially, the police reported no weapon on his body, but later the cops claimed the teenager had stolen a gun from another man minutes earlier, leading them to give chase. In time, the cops produced a gun, which they will connect to the other Black man, who was held on $15,000 bail, and thereby seek to justify the killing of the unarmed, fleeing teenager Justus Howell.\nCleveland cop Michael Brelo distinguished himself as the most murderous member of a mob of 104 cops on a chase-and-shoot spree in Cleveland, Ohio, back in November, 2012. Mistaking a car engine backfire for a gunshot, the crazy cop caravan careened through Cleveland at speeds reaching 100 miles an hour, cornering Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, in a school parking lot. Russell and Williams, unarmed, died in a hail of 137 bullets \u2013 49 of them fired by Officer Brelo, now on trial for voluntary manslaughter. Brelo and his partner fired 15 bullets through their own windshield at the Black victims\u2019 car. Then, at a point when, according to the prosecutor, no cop\u2019s life was in danger (except from other officers), Brelo jumped on the hood of the victims\u2019 car and fired 15 more shots at the mortally wounded man and woman. Today, the cop says he has no recollection of the entire episode.\nIn December, the U.S. Justice Department concluded that Cleveland cops routinely useexcessive force and are unaccountable to the public.

{"idx": "7270", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A southern Delaware advocate for the homeless and those struggling with addiction has a new proposal for affordable shelter: Tiny houses.\nSome look at the tiny house trend as a way to downsize and declutter, to embrace a minimalist lifestyle that focuses more on living than accumulating things.\nFor others, tiny houses can present an affordable way to help people get back on their feet after battling addiction or homelessness.\nThe latter is the spark behind the affordable tiny housing communities proposed for southern Delaware.\n\"Affordable housing isn\u2019t enough anymore,\" said Jim Martin, a trustee of the Christian-based nonprofit Tap Faith Partnerships. \"Affordable housing is too expensive. We have to go to the next level, which is these tiny homes.\"\nStanding on an overgrown piece of property off Spicer Road near Ellendale, Martin and Gene Louis of Tap Faith imagined what the empty 5.5-acre parcel could mean for 10 future tenants in recovery.\n\"I see this as a place for people in recovery, not active addiction,\" he said, adding that ideally the tenants would have at least two years of documented sobriety and that they would have to comply with rules similar to those imposed at Oxford House recovery homes.\n\"It will be highly vetted,\" he said. \"If people start drinking and drugging, they\u2019re gone.\"\nThe project is in its infancy. The group needs about $336,000 to purchase the land, build the micro homes and launch a community center with showers, toilets, computers and other utilities for the residents. They also will need funding and county-level approvals to rezone the land.\nOn Thursday, they wandered the property, studded with brush and small stands of pine trees, and discussed how they could secure the nearly $90,000 parcel for the project.\n\"We\u2019re moving aggressively and trying to get some people to pledge $100 each,\" Martin said. \"The goal is 900 pledges. We\u2019re at 60 now. We\u2019ve got a long way to go.\"\nLouis said purchasing the land will be contingent upon the Sussex County's approval of the project and rezoning of the parcel. And if that doesn\u2019t work out, finding another site will not sink their idea.\n\"It\u2019s not this property that\u2019s important,\" Louis said. \"It\u2019s the community project. It can be done anywhere.\"\nThe concept of building tiny homes for those in recovery is not unique to Delaware. While First State groups are still trying to get their projects off the ground, the idea has become reality in places like Texas, where Communities for Recovery also offers counseling, volunteer opportunities and recovery meetings in addition to small living spaces.\nOthers can be found in upstate New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, and more are popping up or being proposed in cities and suburbs across the country.\nAside from garnering the funding and approvals needed to build, Martin knows he may also face obstacles in the form of stigma and neighborly disapproval. That is part of the reason Port Hope Delaware Inc.\u2019s similar idea for Kent County stalled in 2016. That organization, backed by a $35,000 grant, is now looking for a different place to erect its tiny, affordable housing village.\n\"'Not in my backyard' is just part of the reality of trying to do business,\" Martin said. \"But I think the people that live in our communities realize the people with lower-income jobs need a place to live, too.

That bill collapsed last month because of tepid GOP support, but some Republicans are trying hard to revive it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve expressed to (Republican) leadership that I\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the health care vote until it is responsive to my community,\u201d Denham announced at the town hall.\nThat didn\u2019t satisfy the raucous crowd.

Planned Parenthood passed out stickers and a handful of people wore Trump shirts and displayed a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d sign. Most at the event appeared skeptical of their congressman.\nThough Democrats have long called Denham a prime target, the Republican first elected to state office in 2002 has repeatedly shown himself a survivor. While his San Joaquin Valley colleague, Republican Rep. David Valadao, disavowed Trump last year, Denham stuck with the GOP presidential nominee in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.\nDenham still won re-election by beating beekeeper Michael Eggman by 3.4 percentage points, though it was a markedly narrower victory than the 12-point margin he achieved over Eggman in 2014.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making Denham\u2019s district one of its 20 top targets nationwide with a full-time organizer hired as part of its \u201cMarch into 18\u201d project to unseat Republicans.\nThere\u2019s a problem, though: Democrats don\u2019t have a strong candidate committed to running against Denham at this point.\nThe last two Democrats to challenge him, Eggman and former astronaut Jose Hernandez in 2012, failed to catch fire despite the party\u2019s hopes.

{"idx": "7274", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Pablo Neruda and his passions.\nPablo Neruda was easily the most prolific and popular of all twentieth-century poets. His collected poems run in excess of thirty-five hundred pages, and his books, which have been translated into dozens of languages, have sold in the millions. His life as a diplomat, an exile, and sometimes a fugitive was not an easy one. The solitude that most writers need in order to work was something that Neruda for the most part was denied. Many of his poems reflect the shifting conditions under which he lived, and have at heart a longing for fixity, whether of place or of idea. At his best, he is among the small group of last century\u2019s great poets. Now the most comprehensive selection to date of Neruda\u2019s translated poems has been published. \u201cThe Poetry of Pablo Neruda\u201d (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; $40), edited by Ilan Stavans, a professor of Latin-American and Latino culture at Amherst College, is a weighty volume of almost a thousand pages, including an informative introduction, a bibliography of translations into English of Neruda\u2019s work, and notes on his life and his poetry.\nThe naturalness of these lines, their exuberant and youthful melancholy, their casual repetitions, their over-all simplicity mark Neruda\u2019s early style and account in some measure for the continued popularity of the book.\nBy the third volume, it is clear that Neruda\u2019s poetry has undergone a profound change. In 1935, he was made consul in Madrid, a post from which he was fired a short time later, because of his involvement in Spanish politics. Neruda was a fierce supporter of the Loyalists, and his poems describe the horrors of war as Spain fell to the forces of Franco.\nNeruda\u2019s political concerns were not limited to Spain. Later on in the same book, he pays homage to the Soviet Union (something he continued to do for the rest of his life) with an ode to Stalingrad, comparing\u2014in a gesture that seems not only dated but mistaken\u2014its battle against the Nazi onslaught with the struggles of the Spanish Loyalists. Most political poems do not enjoy a long life, and Neruda\u2019s are no exception. Their urgency turns out to be as perishable as our memory of the events that inspired them. \u201cResidence on Earth\u201d is a diffuse and transitional enterprise, a bridge between the precocious and unprogrammatic early work and the great works of his maturity.\nThe style, with its sweeping hyperboles and celebratory tone, typifies many of the early poems in the \u201cCanto\u201d and reaches its limit in the breathtaking section called \u201cThe Heights of Macchu Picchu,\u201d in which the poet invites the continent\u2019s victimized dead to express themselves through him. He will be their champion, speaking eloquently not only for the victims but for the continent itself. \u201cCanto General\u201d has rarely been matched in its range of subjects, its energy, its imaginative power. It falls down where Neruda substitutes the language of politics for the language of imagination. Even those who agree with his condemnation of the United States, say, and what he believes has been its role in a century-long regime of exploitation and despoilment, will likely feel betrayed by the cornball language of his complaint. Such criticism, however, may be beside the point. Neruda is not a philosophical or meditative poet but one of allegiances and opinions, especially in politics"}

{"idx": "7278", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The version of the official military investigation into the disastrous May 4 air strike in Farah province made public last week by the Central Command was carefully edited to save the U.S. command in Afghanistan the embarrassment of having to admit that earlier claims blaming the massive civilian deaths on the \"Taliban\" were fraudulent.\nBy covering up the most damaging facts surrounding the incident, the rewritten public version of the report succeeded in avoiding media stories on the contradiction between the report and the previous arguments made by the U.S. command.\nThe declassified \"executive summary\" of the report on the bombing issued last Friday admitted that mistakes had been made in the use of air power in that incident. However, it omitted key details which would have revealed the self-serving character of the U.S. command\u2019s previous claims blaming the \"Taliban\" \u2014 the term used for all insurgents fighting U.S. forces \u2014 for the civilian deaths from the air strikes.\nThe report reasserted the previous claim by the U.S. command that only about 26 civilians had been killed in the U.S. bombing on that day, despite well-documented reports by the government and by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission that between 97 and 147 people were killed.\nThe report gave no explanation for continuing to assert such a figure, and virtually admitted that it is not a serious claim by also suggesting that the actual number of civilian deaths in the incident \"may never be known.\"\nThe report also claimed that \"at least 78 Taliban fighters\" were killed. The independent human rights organization had said in its May 26 report that at most 25 to 30 insurgents had been killed, though not necessarily in the air strike.\nA closer reading of the paragraph in the report on Taliban casualties reveals, however, that the number does not actually refer to deaths from the air strike at all. The paragraph refers twice to \"the engagement\" as well as to \"the fighting\" and \"the firefight,\" indicating that the vast majority of the Taliban who died were all killed in ground fighting, not by the U.S. air strike.\nAn analysis of the report\u2019s detailed descriptions of the three separate air strikes also shows that the details in question could not have been omitted except by a deliberate decision to cover up the most damaging facts about the incident.\nThe \"executive summary\" states that the decision to call in all three air strikes in Balabolook district on May 4 was based on two pieces of \"intelligence\" available to the ground commander, an unidentified commander of a special operations forces unit from the U.S. Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MarSOC).\nOne piece of intelligence is said to have been an intercepted statement by a Taliban commander to his fighters to \"mass to maneuver and re-attack\" the Afghan and U.S. forces on the scene. The other was visual sighting of the movement of groups of adults moving at intervals in the dark away from the scene of the firefight with U.S. forces.\nA number of insurgents were said by the report to have been killed in a mosque that was targeted in the first of the three strikes. The \"absence of local efforts to attempt to recover bodies from the rubble in a timely manner,\" the following morning, according to the report, indicates that the bodies were all insurgent fighters, not civilians.\nBut the report indicates that the air strikes referred to as the \"second B1-B strike\" and the \"third B-1B strike\" caused virtually all of the civilian deaths.

{"idx": "7281", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Almost every workplace has at least one toxic employee. You know the type \u2014 always negative, tends to bully others, distracts much of the team. But what if someone were to tell you that you are that person?\nBefore you balk in denial, take a look at some of these common traits that awful employees tend to have. If they uncomfortably hit home, there are steps you can take to rectify the situation before your toxic tendencies can ruin your career.\n1. You make everything about you.\nThis is something most people are guilty of at least once in their lives. Everyone goes through tough times during which they desire more attention than usual.\nPerhaps you\u2019re going through a bad breakup or you recently learned about a family member\u2019s terminal illness. Maybe you have your own insecurities about yourself and your talents at work.\nNo matter the situation, these deep-seated feelings of anger, depression or anxiety can manifest themselves into something negative at work, such as making the conversation about you.\nNext time you\u2019re involved in a group discussion at work, make an effort to listen more and talk less. Notice if you feel the desire to chime in to steer the conversation back to yourself. Instead of giving into this tendency, ask someone else a question. Give another person the floor for a while, and let a co-worker have a chance to shine.\nOnly make a situation or conversation about yourself if it really is about you or if it will add something of value to the discussion. Otherwise, practice your listening skills and give someone else the spotlight for once.\n2. You say and do passive-aggressive things.\nPassive-aggressive behaviors, such as giving backhanded compliments, ignoring a co-worker, delaying a project until the last minute out of spite or purposefully excluding a team member, can taint the entire workplace like a dark cloud.\nIf being passive aggressive is a chronic behavior for you, it can be difficult to be aware of when you\u2019re doing it, and even harder to make a change.\nThe first step is learning more about it. Passive aggressiveness can be a sort of coping or defense mechanism. Toxic employees who use this outlet tend to do it when they feel threatened, jealous or insecure. They may lie, deflect, give a co-worker the silent treatment or talk over others in meetings.\nInstead of coping with your feelings through aggression toward co-workers, get them out in a more productive way. For example, physical exercise can release anger and other negative feelings. Fit in more exercise in your day, before work or during a lunch break. Take walks every few hours to get away from the computer screen and other people.\nAlso, stop and figure out your passive-aggressive triggers. Do you tense up when someone critiques your projects? Is it irritating when a co-worker gets attention and you don\u2019t? Next, stop and listen to yourself when you\u2019re talking. This can help you learn to be less passive aggressive. Observe the language you use when you\u2019re in passive-aggressive mode.\n3. You\u2019re jealous of others\u2019 success.\nLet\u2019s dive into jealousy just a bit more. It\u2019s a common trait that can turn into toxic behavior at work. This is especially true if you happen to be a brilliant but arrogant employee. You know, the one who\u2019s used to getting promotions, accolades and pats on the back.\nIf a co-worker starts to get the attention instead, your jealous tendencies may show through in ways that make you an awful presence in the office. You might express jealousy upfront or through passive-aggressive behaviors, such as"}

{"idx": "7283", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: An interesting exchange in parliament on the 28th of February inadvertently exposed the Achilles heel of National\u2019s so-called welfare reform. John Key was asked by Metiria Turei why the Government was \u201cintent on forcing single parents with little babies as young as 12 months\u201d into work.\nIn reply John Key asked the House the rhetorical question \u201cWhy do we think it is better for them to go to work?\u201d Answering his own question revealed that welfare reform is all about moving sole parents from Work and Income NZ, where they get to deal face-to-face with a case worker, into the clutches of the IRD, where they do not.\nIn other words, getting a job on low wages at 20 hours a week means getting a big pot of money from the state to \u201cmake work pay\u201d. Only that way it is better to go to work than remain on a benefit.\nWorking 20 hours a week at the current minimum wage of $13 an hour equals $260 gross per week, or $227.50 in the hand, which is not enough to support a family with children.\nSo with a new-found faith in Working for Families, John Key is arguing that 20 hours of work pays because the sole parent gets a top-up week of $199.50 from the Minimum Family Tax Credit.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. The government will throw in another $60 for the In-Work Tax Credit. An annual net $13,500 for extra tax credits, plus extra childcare subsidies from the state sounds pretty much the same as a benefit.\nThe Key government should be ashamed to be promoting these highly complex tax credits as the answer to shortcomings in the relatively simple benefit system. Sole parents with young children need support and calling government support by another name doesn\u2019t make a parent more worthy.\nSole parents need to be treated better when they earn a bit more on the benefit. Part-time work needs to be encouraged with less loss of benefit. It is a good way to get work experience that might be manageable with young children.\nThe government appears to have accepted the recommendation of the Welfare Working Group who mindlessly accepted that welfare was bad and the tax credit system was a superior solution.\nAs the Tax Working Group showed, the Minimum Family Tax Credit has a 100% effective marginal tax rate, making it the worst work incentive ever devised. That means for every additional dollar of net income earned up to $22,204 per year, the Minimum Family Tax Credit disappears dollar for dollar. At the minimum wage, someone who was working 20 hours would have to work an additional 17 hours before being any better off at all.\nThe Minimum Family Tax Credit is effectively a subsidy to employers. They can get away with paying only the minimum wage as they know a higher hourly rate will not give any more in the hand to someone receiving the Minimum Family Tax Credit.\nThis shambles is impossible for IRD to administer fairly and leaves sole parents vulnerable to having their incomes reduced sharply should their hours fall below 20 a week. Workers who face casualised employment have the ongoing problems of reporting in to IRD on a weekly basis, as well as extremely uncertain income.\nSole parents accessing this tax credit report high stress of never knowing exactly what they will get. They may face aggressive demands for the repayment of tax credits from IRD when IRD says they did not satisfy the rules. Families cannot possibly budget or function with any level of certainty and security under these circumstances.\nEmployers also face uncertainty when they"}

But we have told the Chinese to resume, as the government will resolve their issues,\u201d he added.\nDuring the 5th meeting of the Joint Energy Working Group on Monday, the Chinese workers were also asked to hold a meeting with the respective quarters to resolve matters. \u201cTalks with the Chinese are under way and we hope they will soon resume work,\u201d Mr Khokhar claimed.\nAccording to documents, issues between the company and the government are not new, as some emerged in August last year on operational and management (O&M) cost of the project determined by Nepra.\n\u201cThe total annual O&M cost of the project was approved as $41.90m.

{"idx": "7285", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I first came into contact with the illustrations of Frank Netter while in a small used bookstore in New England 25 years ago. It had a copy of \"The CIBA Collection of Medical Illustrations\" from 1948. It's an unassuming looking oversize volume in a blue cover, but contains a wild spin on what I'd always thought was a clinical, cut and dried world that would only be of interest to doctors, surgeons and medical students.\nFrank H. Netter, M.D. (1906-1991) was a physician, and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, but also a leading medical illustrator. He studied at the National Academy of Design and the Arts Students League while attending NYU and working at Bellevue. He supplemented his studies and income with illustration commissions, sometimes for his professors. Although he soon had his own private practice in NYC, he continued his work as an artist but after a misunderstanding wherein Netter asked for $1,500 for a series of five pictures and an advertising manager agreed to and paid $1,500 each -- $7,500 for the series -- Netter gave up the practice of medicine. His relationship with CIBA began in 1936 with the depiction he designed of a fold-out human heart used to promote the sale of the medicine Digitalis. His work was also used to market Novocain. He's best known for illustrating the multiple volume CIBA Medical Illustrations set. In 1989, his \"Atlas of Human Anatomy\" was published and is considered a staple of medical education.\nMy fascination with Netter's work comes from how he'd often employ what feels like a documentary approach to his designed scenarios. These aren't just clinical depictions or representations, they have a personality and even a warmth that initially stunned me. The individual stamp of Netter's hand is always there ... not what I expected from the world of medical manuals.\n(Nerd note: he also wrote and illustrated, the obscure \"Fad Diets Can Be Deadly\" in 1975)."}

Some of them will take time, but we'll have a continuing monitoring process.\"\nThe Big 12 last year started withholding 25 percent of revenue payments to Baylor pending verification of the 105 changes recommended by Pepper Hamilton, the firm that handled the initial investigation in 2016. The scandal led to the departures of school President Ken Starr and athletic director Ian McCaw. Art Briles, a two-time Big 12 champion football coach, was fired.\n\"We are appreciative of the Big 12's recognition of the significant progress that has been made across the Baylor campus, as well as of our unwavering commitment to the safety and security of our students,\" Baylor President Linda Livingstone said.\nBaylor is still waiting for the outcome of an NCAA investigation into the scandal .\nOklahoma State President Burns Hargis, chairman of the committee overseeing the Big 12's verification effort, said the goal was not to look back at what transpired at Baylor, but rather to look forward with a thorough third-party review that the recommendations were implemented, and to ensure compliance with all Big 12 bylaws.\nLivingstone said it was the second independent verification, and that the recommendations have already helped the university in Waco prevent and respond to reports of sexual assault and interpersonal violence.\nOf the nearly $14.3 million withheld from Baylor, about $1.65 million will be reimbursed to the league to cover legal costs. The remaining money, about $12.6 million, will be invested for the next four years. The net earnings from that will be distributed annually in equal portions to all 10 conference schools to be used for funding anti-violence and anti-harassment efforts on campus and in athletics.\nAt the end of four years, the Big 12 board of university presidents and chancellors will determine the amount of money returned to Baylor, minus the $2 million fine for \"reputational damage to the conference and its members.\"\nBig 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said the fine \"represents the collective concern of the membership regarding the negative publicity that this has cast on the Big 12 and the member institutions.\" He said the fine would likely be split among the other nine schools.\nThe report done by Polsinelli PC was intended to legally assess whether Baylor had followed through on recommendations adopted by Baylor regents in May 2016.\n\"The verification team is of the opinion that Baylor has in all material respects structurally completed and practically implemented the (105 Pepper Hamilton) recommendations as of the date hereof,\" reads the report, dated Aug. 31. \"Whether the recommendations that require future action or are aspirational in nature will continue to be implemented in a sustainable manner will only be verifiable"}
{"idx": "7295", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Headphone 'burn-in': Fact or fantasy?\nA lot of audiophiles believe headphones sound better after a few weeks of use than they do when they're brand-new.\nMost of my audiophile friends believe that headphones (and speakers and electronics) sound better after the first 100 hours of use than they do when they're brand-new. When I'm doing high-end product reviews I leave the \"burn-in, break-in\" question up to the manufacturer. If the company's reps claim their product won't sound its best until it has a solid month of use, I'll request a unit with enough hours on it that I can start working on the review right away. If the manufacturer scoffs at the very idea of burn-in, I start my serious listening immediately.\nAudiophiles don't agree on exactly how long headphone break-in should take, and opinions range from 10 hours to many hundreds of hours. AKG's K 701 full-size headphones are \"notorious\" for sounding lifeless straight out of the box. The word on the audiophile street is they need 300 hours of break-in.\nI believe headphones' sound \"matures\" over time, and I recently had the chance to compare a brand-new set of Etymotic ER-4PT in-ear headphones with my 10-year-old ER-4Ps. I felt the older set was \"slightly more 'relaxed' and more laid-back in its tonal balance.\" The two models have identical specifications, and yet they sounded different. So beyond the burn-in question, maybe headphones \"wear\" over time?\nI called upon a local (Brooklyn, N.Y.) headphone manufacturer, Grado Labs' John Grado, to weigh in about burn-in, and he said, \"All mechanical things need break-in.\" He did not recommend leaving headphones playing continuously for a few days to hasten the process. He recommends using new headphones as you normally would, and after 50 hours or so the sound will be all it can be.\nI imagine some of you must be wondering if anyone has ever tested and measured the effects of headphone burn-in, and luckily enough Inner Fidelity's Tyll Hertsens has done just that. Better yet, he measured a brand-new AKG 701 (specifically, it was the Quincy Jones Q701), and that's the model that so many audiophiles cite as notorious for its need for burn-in. So Hertsens measured them, starting after they had 5 minutes of use; then 25 minutes; 1 hour; 2 hours; 5 hours; 10 hours; 20 hours; 40 hours; 65 hours; and finally at the 90-hour mark.\nI'll cut to the chase: Hertsens definitely found small changes in the AKG headphones' measured frequency response, and you can see evidence of that in the many graphs in his article. Even so, when I talked with Hertsens after the article was published he still had major reservations about the burn-in question. He thinks that some aspects of burn-in can be attributed to owners getting used to the sound of their new headphones, and that makes sense to me. Measurements are, as always, open to interpretation. Hertsens measures headphones in his reviews, and I had a million questions about how he does that. There's a lot more to learn about In"}

These mean that the sell and buy side must store, report, consolidate and use data - often on a real-time basis - as never before. Better data quality, standardised utility-like platforms, efficiency and control are all required in this new environment.\nThe capital and collateral requirements coming in under Basel III are also driving a need for more intra-day information and the reformed markets require more linkages to custodians and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs). Still other regulations wait on the horizon, such as the EU'S Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II and its Market Abuse Directive (MAD) II, which is aiming to stop further Libor, FX and other such mis-selling scandals or rogue trading behaviour.\nCompliance, allied to monitoring for risk concentration and market abuse, are the key drivers for the data deluge.\nBanks, asset managers, brokers, infrastructure providers and all other types of market participants - even national regulators themselves as the recipients of all this reporting data - are required to respond to the call for centralised reporting, clearing and enhanced transparency, emanating from the post-crash Pittsburgh G20 meeting back in 2009.\nAccording to Michael Cooper, chief technology officer (CTO) at BT Radianz, there is almost exponential growth in data volumes, driven by regulators' concern to capture all data. \"Both structured and unstructured data, which requires interpretation and often relates to social media and so-called 'big data' analytics, is being collected now for the prevention of market abuse and forensics investigations afterwards,\" he says. \"Market changes are also driving the data deluge (i.e. more margin calls, etc).\"\nSteve Colwill, director of Velocimetrics, a data analysis and benchmarking firm that offers real-time performance monitoring, rightly warns data should be seen as a competitive advantage in this new marketplace, adding that: \"If data isn't clean, then it is just 'stuff'.\"\nMoreover, it isn't just transaction reporting duties under EMIR, Dodd Frank, or even the EU's wholesale Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) rules that are driving the data deluge. The market abuse and conduct agenda, Know Your Customer (KYC), counterparty, tax beneficiary and other such storage requirements also matter, alongside centralised clearing and other transactional duties.\nAs Robert Powell, global head of compliance at Etrali warns: \"EU rules, such as MAD II, cover all voice data and conversations, which need to be kept for surveillance purposes, regardless of where platform trades are executed or stored.\"\nStephen McGoldrick, co-chair of the EMEA regulatory subcommittee at the FIX Trading Community standards body, and a director of market structure at Deutsche Bank, accepts there is a rising data demand. \"Yes, there will be a data deluge (in the wake of all these regulations),\" he says, \"but it's something we'll just have to cope with.

Those funds would have supported many construction jobs.\nThe $827-billion package debated yesterday -- down from a $937-billion or so version debated during the week -- included Obama's signature tax cut of up to $1,000 for working couples. Also included is a tax credit of up to $15,000 for home buyers and smaller breaks for people buying new cars.\nObama himself acknowledged the bill was far from perfect but said it would be too dangerous to leave it lifeless on the table. \"In the midst of our greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people were hoping that Congress would begin to confront the great challenges we face,\" Obama said before departing for his first trip to Camp David.\nLawmakers were already looking ahead to House and Senate talks, where a handful of GOP moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- whose votes are crucial -- seemed to have the upper hand against House Democrats unhappy with changes such as curbing increases for early childhood education and subsidies to bring the Internet to rural areas.\nThe Senate heads toward a key vote tomorrow.

The role played by spy services is completely evident here. We should use this opportunity to pin Wahhabism down and deal a blow to it,\u201d he added.\nThe existent conflict, Nasrallah said, was not between Shias and Sunnis, but with Wahhabism.\nWahhabism is the radical ideology dominating Saudi Arabia, freely preached by government-backed clerics there, and inspiring extremists worldwide. Daesh and other hardliner groups use the ideology to declare people of other faiths as \u201cinfidels\u201d and then kill them.\nNasrallah also said what posed a yet bigger threat than even Wahhabism and Zionism was \u201cBritish Shiism,\u201d which, he said, was being promoted by pseudo-religious figures, whom he called mercenaries of intelligence services.\nThe Hezbollah chief said Saudi Arabia had escalated tensions to a climax and was trying, with the help of US and Britain, to portray conflicts as sectarian.\nReferring to the Syrian conflict, he said there were no \u201cmoderate\u201d armed groups in Syria, warning that all those fighting Damascus were either working with Daesh or al-Nusra, which has recently renamed itself.\nNasrallah also said there was no prospect a political solution for the Syrian conflict. \u201cDevelopments on the [battle] ground will ultimately determine [the outcome],\u201d he said matter-of-factly.\nSyria has been fighting a brutal civil war since March 2011.

A major reason for, as well as a consequence of, the community's high literacy rate is the thriving Muslim-owned Malayalam press.\nToday, literally hundreds of magazines, journals and newspapers are brought out by various Kerala Muslim organisations. These deal not simply with religion (as in the case of many north Indian Muslim-owned publications) but with social and political issues as well. These publications have played a crucial role in promoting social and political awareness among Kerala's Muslims and in getting Muslim views and concerns across to fellow Malayali non-Muslims and to the state authorities and in promoting closer interaction between the various communities in Kerala.\nSet up in 1987 by the Ideal Publications Trust, most of whose members are affiliated with the Kerala unit of the Jamaat-e Islami, Madhyamam is regarded as the most successful Muslim-owned daily newspaper in Kerala. It boasts the third highest circulation among all Malayalam daily newspapers in the state. Its chief editor O Abdur Rahman stresses that it is not a specifically Muslim or an Islamic paper. \"Madhyamam is geared to all Malayalam readers and takes up general issues, while focusing in particular on those related to marginalised and minority communities, including Dalits, Adivasis and backward castes, and not just Muslims alone. We see it as the voice of the voiceless,\" he states. \"We have been consistently anti-imperialist, supporting a range of liberation movements and also bitterly critiquing fascism, extremism in the name of religion and terrorism,\" he adds. He describes Madhyamam as \"a value-based paper, stressing ethics and morals, in contrast to commercial papers, whose sole motive is profit-making\".\nMadhyamam's editorial offices are located in Calicut, the major intellectual centre for Muslims in Kerala. Currently, it brings out separate editions from six cities in Kerala --Cochin, Trivandrum, Cannanore, Mallapuram, Kottayam and Calicut -- and two in Karnataka -- Bangalore and Mangalore. Separate Gulf editions, catering to the half million-odd Malayalis living in Arab countries, come out from Dubai, Bahrain, Kuwait, Doha, Dammam, Riyadh and Jeddah, making Madhyamam the largest-circulated Malayalam newspaper in the region. In addition, the Madhyamam Weekly magazine has a circulation of some 25,000. Currently, the entire Madhyamam group has some 1,200 staff on its rolls, including around 500 full-time journalists.\nA major challenge that Madhyamam has had to contend with is lack of sufficient advertisement revenue. Explains Abdur Rahman, \"Newspapers survive on money from advertisements, but from the very beginning we had decided, as a matter of policy, to be very selective about the advertisements we published. No ads showing immodestly-clad women, no ads for banks, alcohol, fraudulent investments and movies. This is why we had to suffer major losses, and even now just manage to break even.' A portion of the profits that the paper generates is diverted to the Madhyamam Health Care Programme, which provides free medical facilities to poor people, irrespective of religion and caste in hospitals with which it has a tie-up with.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a press conference to discuss the mounting financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island last August felt the brunt of Tropical Storm Irene, one of the record 14 natural disasters in the United States last year that each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Irene alone, which first came ashore as a hurricane, killed at least 45 people and caused more than $7 billion in damage.\n\"Perhaps no industry better understands the impact of global warming than the insurance industry whose job it is to analyze risk,\" Sanders said. \"I am pleased leaders in that industry are speaking out about the need to reverse global warming.\" Added Whitehouse, \"Extreme weather events, like Rhode Island's historic floods in 2010, can result in the loss of homes, livelihoods, and even lives. These extreme events fit a pattern predicted by climate scientists, and we should take action now to minimize the damage that carbon pollution is causing to our country and our world.\"\nProperty and casualty insurers in the United States experienced an extraordinary estimated $44 billion in losses last year when hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes and other natural disasters were more severe, longer, more frequent and less predictable than in the past. \"From our industry's perspective, the footprints of climate change are around us and the trend of increasing damage to property and threat to lives is clear,\" said Franklin Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America.\nAccording to Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd., the average weather-related insurance industry loss in the U.S. was about $3 billion a year in the 1980s compared to approximately $20 billion annually by the end of the past decade. \"A warming climate will only add to this trend of increasing losses, which is why action is needed now,\" said Mark Way, head of Swiss Re's sustainability and climate change activities in the Americas.\na\"Extreme weather is a threat today and a greater threat tomorrow,\" said Pete Thomas, chief risk officer at Willis Re, one of the world's leading reinsurance intermediaries. \"I'm pleased to see the federal government grappling with this issue. The continuing work of Sens. Sanders and Whitehouse is an important start for this necessary dialogue.\"\nA senior official at Ceres, a coalition of investors and public interest groups, put it bluntly. \"Our climate is changing, human activity is helping to drive the change, and the costs of these extreme weather events are going to keep ballooning unless we break through our political paralysis, and bring down emissions that are warming our planet,\" said Cynthia McHale, the insurance program director at Ceres. \"If we continue on this path, extreme weather is certain to cause more homes and businesses to be uninsurable in the private insurance market, leaving the costs to taxpayers or individuals.\""}

{"idx": "7339", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: On screen, 12 mysterious black ships suddenly materialize at different places across the world. Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and a few soldiers arrive at acclaimed linguist Louise Banks\u2019s (Amy Adams) doorstep to bring her to speak with the aliens. The aliens, large cephalopod-like creatures, nicknamed heptapods due to their seven appendages, can speak, but not in any language that humanity can understand. Banks, along with Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), regularly meets with the aliens at the ship that appeared in U.S. airspace in an attempt to establish communication.\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve, the mind behind Prisoners and Sicario, Arrival is this Oscar season\u2019s best sci-fi movie so far, even though science fiction isn\u2019t a category in the Academy Awards. In a cinematic wasteland full of sequels, prequels, remakes, and reboots, Arrival is one of the few truly good movies this year. It shows that Hollywood is still capable of producing original content, or at least content based on original stories. Movies that make audiences think and ask them interesting questions are few and far between these days. If aliens were to arrive on Earth, could we communicate with them meaningfully? If they arrived in multiple countries, how long would it take before governments decided to blow them out of the sky? Could humanity work together long enough to figure it all out?\nArrival tries, and succeeds, at answering these questions within its own universe. Banks and Donnelly work with the two heptapods on the U.S. ship to form a system of communication. In one of the most incredible scenes in Arrival, Banks manages to get the aliens, affectionately nicknamed Abbot and Costello, to \u201cwrite.\u201d Heptapods do not write like any known written language on Earth. They convey large ideas, like sentences and paragraphs, with large circular symbols made from the black material they can exude from their feet. The heptapods also have a very different concept of time. Their words do not have tenses. Instead they speak in terms of large feelings and impressions. Banks breaches this language barrier by using a device not previously seen in any science fiction movie to date: a dry-erase board. While the tools may be rudimentary, they constitute a major breakthrough. The wonder and relief that Banks and Donnelly express are palpable.\nAdams gives a stellar performance as Banks. Her character has a very emotional experience throughout the movie, and Adams expresses this very well. Renner and Whitaker both do a very good job in supporting roles.\nThe visuals in Arrival are stunning. Every shot is bright and vibrant without being overwhelming. The movie shows the action on screen clearly and without interruption. Too often, alien movies suffer from too much or too little of the actual aliens. Arrival holds just enough back, leaving the audience wanting more of the heptapods. What truly drives Arrival, however, is its story. The acting and visuals only serve to complement this fascinating plot. The film is like an iceberg: any knowledge of the movie gleaned from trailers is only surface level. Arrival is a welcome and fresh experience after a year of tiresome, unoriginal films. Fans of science fiction will love this movie, but they will definitely not be the only ones arriving at the theater."}

Polls show the public at large is increasingly skeptical of his proposal, but what about people in Louisville after Bush made his spiel in person? The answer appears mixed.\nSome people, such as Travis Berkley, said they hadn't focused on Social Security until Bush's visit.\n\"Social Security isn't an everyday topic at work. We pretend it doesn't even exist,\" said Berkley, a 23-year-old bank credit manager.\nBut after sitting in the second row at the town hall and shaking Bush's hand afterward, Berkeley said the event was an eye-opener that made him think.\n\"He presented one possibility and said other people have brought stuff to the table. I want to hear more,\" he said. \"I want to see it all on paper.\"\nBush supporters used his visit to educate the uninitiated and rev up interest among the Republican base. The local Republican Party held a public meeting the night before that attracted press attention.\nThe Spalding Group, a firm that makes campaign materials exclusively for Republicans, took out a full-page ad in The Louisville Courier-Journal the day of Bush's visit. It offered free yard signs and bumper stickers that read \"Act Now, Strengthen Social Security, Support President Bush!\" to anyone wanting one.\nNot to be outdone, Louisville's Democratic Party held its own public Social Security meeting Wednesday night to stoke their base against Bush's plan.\nAnd AARP, the influential lobby for Americans 50 and older, took out a full-page ad in Thursday's Courier-Journal with a mock-up of a Social Security card that read \"IF YOU have a problem with the sink, YOU DON'T tear down the entire house.\" AARP opposes Bush's plan.\nOn Thursday, local TV stations broke into their regular programming to carry Bush's event live.\nOn Friday, the Courier-Journal featured several stories on the event, focusing on Bush's message, the local people involved and protests outside.\nBut for all the attention, few if any Louisville media outlets pointed out that Bush's call for private accounts would do nothing to bring Social Security closer to fiscal solvency.\n\"Local media tends to be relatively non-critical and simply covers the White House message because they are dazzled by a White House visit,\" said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who analyzes the media. \"It's like having the White House press release handed to all the readers and viewers, with the added credibility of an independent news organization.\"\nThe Courier-Journal did publish an article Friday that fact-checked some of Bush's remarks.

The project has been unofficially dubbed \"nutrient farming.\"\n\"We think it's a good investment. We're confident that it'll work,\" said Richard Lanyon, the district's general superintendent. \"We expect the state of Illinois will adopt water quality standards for nutrients and we will be obligated to meet those standards. We know wetlands remove nutrients.\"The planners' challenge comes in creating an incentive strong enough to convince enough landowners to go along with the project. Establishing a market of \"nutrient credits,\" through which businesses dumping chemicals into public waterways could compensate for polluting by defraying the clean-up costs, would be a potential solution. In addition, because the wetlands absorb carbon dioxide from the air, carbon credits could also be sold to energy-intensive industries such as power companies.\nWhile not guaranteed to succeed (farmers and other landowners have been notoriously difficult to monitor in the past for similar projects), all agree that more needs to be done to reduce nutrient levels in the public waterways. The Environmental Protection Agency recently mandated state governments to either establish firm water quality standards for phosphorus and nitrogen or adopt proposed federal guidelines.\nA similar scheme arranged at a nearby city helped bring back several endangered species and has made the area a popular birdwatcher destination. \"It's a tremendous accomplishment.

It's a USB-charging cable for iOS devices that's in the shape of a business card. The ChargeCard looks cool but I seem to remember seeing other devices kind of like it. So I dashed off an e-mail to Noah Dentzel, one of the two guys behind the project (Adam Miller is the other), asking him how it was different -- or better -- than I product I'd found on eBay . The product I'd dug up had a built-in rechargeable battery while the ChargeCard was just a cable.\nGreat question. ChargeCard is better because it is 1/10th an inch thick. This one in the link is likely 4-5/10ths of an inch thick making it much more difficult than ours to stow in your wallet. Ours is 1/3rd the thickness of anything else on the market, which is vital when you're deciding what's worthy of your scarce wallet storage space. We agree the battery pack is useful, but it doesn't satisfy the core need: always having it on you when you really need it.\nDentzel called it a \"jumper cable\" for your iPhone. One nice feature is that it's designed to work with thicker, \"tough\" cases. As for what happens if Apple releases an iPhone 5 with a smaller connector port (there are strong rumors that it will), he said they looked forward to developing any future connectors once Apple released the specifications.\n\"For now though,\" he said, \"ours works on the over 200 million iPhones sold to date, including the many hundreds of millions of iPods (and let's not forget iPads, too!).\"\nThere you have it. A unique, useful product? You be the judge. As with most Kickstarter projects, if you make a pledge to buy the product (preorder it), you get a discount (the ChargeCard's retail price is set at $25 but you can get it for $18). If you increase your pledge, you can also choose from different color options and even get one with a customized inscription. The project will be funded if it raises $50,000."}

That's especially been the case for kids' films such as \"Cars.\" In fact, previous Disney-Pixar films have had tie-ins with McDonald's (Research) and Kellogg (Research).\nBut Pam El, vice president of marketing for State Farm, said the company thought a promotion for \"Cars,\" which tells the tale of reckless race car Lightning McQueen, was a natural since it is the nation's largest auto insurer.\nAn executive at Disney's Buena Vista subsidiary echoed this sentiment.\n\"State Farm's passion for the movie matches their love of cars and their concern for keeping drivers and passengers safe, which is sure to add to the success of launching 'Cars,'\" said Cherise McVicar, senior vice president, national promotions for Buena Vista Pictures Marketing, in a statement.\nEl added that the company felt a special affinity for the movie because of the plot \ufffd Lightning McQueen and his friends are often driving on the famous Route 66.\n\"Our headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois, are near the old Route 66. So that's one of the initial things that intrigued us since the movie takes place on Route 66,\" she said.\nAmong the various promotions, State Farm is launching a \"Countdown to Cars\" giveaway on its Web site this week. The company will give out 2007 red Ford Mustang 2-door Coupe Deluxe cars to 25 winners.\nNew State Farm commercials starring some of the characters from the movie will hit airwaves during the week of May 22. El said the first commercial will air during the top-rated television show \"American Idol.\" State Farm is also sponsoring a road trip to various cities featuring actual cars made up to look like ones from the movie.\nAnd the company will also offer limited edition North American road atlases with Lightning McQueen on the cover beginning next month through State Farm agents.\nFinancial terms of the marketing agreement were not disclosed. State Farm will not be mentioned in the movie either, El said. Pixar films have tended to use fictitious corporate names for products. For example, the logo on Lightning McQueen's tires says \"Lightyear,\" a reference to hero Buzz Lightyear from Pixar's first movie, \"Toy Story.\"\n"}

Despite Sony sending out feelers to other cable networks and reportedly getting interest from FX, all sides feel confident that Breaking Bad will return to AMC for what is expected to be its final chapter. Creator Vince Gilligan had made it clear that he wants to end the series after Season 5. I\u2019ve learned that AMC has an offer on the table for a standard 13-episode fifth season but Sony is looking for more. People close to the matter expect the final deal to be for 13-20 episodes, possibly spread over 2 seasons. Besides pinning down the exact size of the order, a sticking point has been who will shoulder the production cost for Breaking Bad going forward. In TV, starting with Season 5, the network take over 100% of a show\u2019s production cost. In the early days of original series on basic cable, the networks didn\u2019t know quite how to handle the tricky Season 4-Season 5 transition financially and tended to cancel shows after four seasons, like Lifetime\u2019s Any Day Now. In the case of Breaking Bad, I hear AMC is asking Sony for some participation in the budget, which most recently was around $3.2 million an episode. AMC and Sony\u2019s previous license negotiation last year was also lengthy and difficult. But this time around, a renewal appeared a much easier proposition, given the series\u2019 double-digit ratings growth for the start of Season 4, including posting a series high with the season premiere. Additionally, the auxiliary market, where Breaking Bad had been far weaker than AMC\u2019s signature series Mad Men, also has picked up. Thanks in part to a savvy deal Sony made with Walmart, DVD sales for Season 3 went up double digits from Season 2, a rare feat for a series these says.

Not bad for a long weekend\u2019s work.\nThere was nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s seeking to improve relations with Russia. As the president rightly asserted, \u201cIt is better to take risks for peace.\u201d But that need not have involved the bullying that took place in Brussels and London, and the offensive tweets that he issued throughout his trip.\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Germany were not without foundation. Europe\u2019s richest country has been notoriously reluctant to spend money on defense, ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Moreover, Germany has been complicit in permitting the Iranians to move funds out of German banks prior to the imposition of America\u2019s latest round of financial sanctions on Tehran. Finally, Germany has opted to support the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the face of American opposition and has, to all intents and purposes, forced its neighbors to support it as well.\nIf Trump\u2019s treatment of German Chancellor Angela Merkel was offensive, his disparagement of Theresa May in an interview to Britain\u2019s Sun newspaper, which appeared on the street as he dined with the British prime minister, was even worse. In rejecting her approach to Brexit and in complimenting Boris Johnson, her recently departed foreign minister, Trump weakened Britain\u2019s position in negotiating with a tough, virtually implacable European Union. And, in the case of both Merkel and May, his subsequent kind words were nothing less than those that schoolyard bullies use when, having beaten some poor unfortunate, they put their arms around the victim\u2019s shoulder and tell the teacher that they really are good friends.\nTrump\u2019s belated praise of both leaders is likely to ring hollow with the publics of the countries they lead. Whatever they may think of May and Merkel, British and German citizens will nevertheless resent Trump\u2019s insulting their elected leaders. The now-famous Trump blimp over London is but a symptom of the widespread hostility to the American president that reigns in Europe today.\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the EU are of a piece with his haranguing of Prime Minister May and Chancellor Merkel. They reflect his basic misunderstanding of what the organization is all about. Lacking any knowledge of post-war European history, the American president does not realize that the primary purpose for the creation of the EU\u2019s predecessors, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community, was to prevent France and Germany from again going to war.

From 1 December, it is pretty much a solid month of eschewing plates of crispy, vamped-up vegetables at office parties and sinking your teeth into indistinguishable party-platter pastries.\nChristmas is getting tempted by towers of teeth-clampingly sweet treats, displayed everywhere from your own bedside cabinet to the doctor\u2019s surgery. Food is Christmas. Christmas is food. And with every nostalgia-coated mouthful comes a gravy boat full of memories deep enough to drown in.\nFor me, the taste of Christmas has always been very sweet and very crumbly. What can I say? I love pastry. My granny\u2019s apple pie is nothing short of ambrosial and my dad\u2019s shortbread biscuits were simply the best. My granny passed her love of cooking on to my dad, who was also a chef, and he passed it on to me. The first memory I have of baking is me, aged five or so, propped up on a chair, cutting shortbread rounds from a slab of squidgy pastry, tucked underneath Dad\u2019s elbow in our kitchen in December. Now I can\u2019t walk past a tartan-topped gift box without scoffing the lot.\nFood is a comforting tool of nostalgia, which is why we love to overindulge at Christmas with all the things that we find tastiest. It is part of celebrating, and it also reminds us of good times with people we love. After all, counting Christmases is a way to catalogue time; marking the year\u2019s end by feasting, indulging and drinking to excess, until we are practically sick, is a tried and tested tradition. Come December, we dutifully prepare to waddle into another year; bloated, unrestrained by buckle or belt but, ultimately, at peace.\nThis year will be the third Christmas I have spent without my dad and the third time I have felt disconnected from the Christmas traditions he built with my mum and brother, in the kitchen and beyond. On Christmas morning, it used to be the crispiest roast potato competition, with my brother and I fighting to pick the best one. After the prawn cocktail starter, Dad\u2019s soft, herby stuffing was the highlight of dinner and later, bellies bursting, we would rack up the cheeses. Mum\u2019s portions were always dainty and she would roll her eyes in mock disapproval as Dad created a comical, towering blue cheese-to-cracker ratio, which often looked as if it would break before it reached his mouth.\nChristmas was split between our family home and Dad\u2019s parents in Shropshire, who also know how to do a proper spread. But last year, for the first time, I took myself to sunny climes when Mum and I weren\u2019t really speaking. The aim, of course, was to go somewhere so un-Christmas-like that I would forget the fact that baby Jesus was ever born. I surrounded myself with sunshine and pina coladas instead of cranberry sauce and crackers, and it kind of worked. I got blind drunk alone in a hostel and ate a most unsatisfactory Christmas dinner of chicken, rice and beans, which really didn\u2019t hit the spot. Christmas is about what you feel in your heart, of course, but also in your stomach.\nThis year, my mum and my brother and I are going to Rome \u2013 something Dad would not really"}

Also weighing on the stock is the cost of an ambitious store renovation program that has eaten into profits, causing the company to miss expectations in its second quarter ended Sept. 29. The company said it has renovated 18 stores since 2016, with plans to complete another eight by the end of March. Indigo has 209 stores, including its first U.S. location that opened last month in New Jersey.\nRevenue fell 3.7 per cent to $216.3-million for the second quarter ended Sept. 29, which was below expectations of about $227.5-million. When it reported the results earlier this month, Indigo said that the drop was largely because of the closing of a few low-performing stores and renovations at 12 stores in the quarter. Its net loss widened to $19.1-million or 70 cents per share versus a loss of $4.6-million or 17 cents a year ago, which it said was due to investments in store renovations, the expansion of its distribution facilities as well as minimum wage increases in provinces such as Ontario. Total comparable sales increased a modest 0.7 per cent year-over-year in the quarter.\nBoth analysts who cover the stock have a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation and an average 12-month price target of $23.25, which implies a gain of about 95 per cent from the current price around $12. On Friday, the stock slipped to $11.94, its lowest level since the fall of 2015, before closing up 6.6 per cent, or 79 cents, at $12.74. The stock traded at a 52-week high of $20.25 in early March, off the momentum of results from last year\u2019s holiday shopping period, which Ms. Reisman described as the \u201cbiggest holiday to date.\u201d Indigo reported its highest-ever quarterly revenues of $433.3-million for that holiday season. Analysts are expecting revenue to come in at $428.2-million for the comparable period ending Dec. 30.\nWhile the stock is cheap today, it\u2019s not very liquid, with about 57 per cent held by insiders, and the retail sector remains risky given the intense competition, said Ryan Modesto, chief executive of the independent firm 5i Research. \u201cWe like the stores, but not so much the company as an investment,\u201d Mr. Modesto said. \u201cWe like growth companies and this isn\u2019t one of them \u2026 [but] a value investor probably could make a case for it.\"\nCormark Securities analyst David McFadgen said he\u2019s still waiting to see the positive impact to overall revenues from the company\u2019s renovation activities, describing the impact on financials as a \u201cshort-term issue,\u201d in a Nov. 7 note.

France wants to maintain high levels of agricultural payments, while poorer member states want to continue to receive structural funds to develop their infrastructure.\nCameron, who returns from a three-day trip to the Middle East this afternoon, has focused his frustrations on Brussels officials, however.\n\"One of the things that's so notable about the Commission proposal is not only are they proposing a completely ludicrous 100 billion euro increase in the European budget, but they are also not proposing to make any cuts to the central administrative costs,\" the prime minister said.\nThat approach was criticised by Stephen Tindale, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform think-tank, who said the view the EU budget was the fault of EU bureaucrats is \"nonsense\".\n\"This is about the politics of the member states,\" he told politics.co.uk. \"The Commission are not at fault for the outcome, but they are at fault in my view for not having put forward proposals which were bolder and would at least have allowed space for some more progressive, forward-looking discussions.\"\nGermany had threatened to oppose an increase in the EU budget alongside France and Britain, but has abandoned that position in the wake of the eurozone crisis. Cameron will find it extremely hard to get his way without the support of the country with the biggest economy in Europe.\n\"The meeting tonight is absolutely crucial because Germany has always been one of the central players in European discussions, and increasingly Germany is THE central player,\" Tindale added.\n\"I would say the chances of agreement being reached are very small. The likelihood is the negotiations will grind on through next year - and that is partly because Germany has a general election next autumn.\"\nGerman voters are becoming increasingly frustrated with spending on the EU, having used their funds to bail out struggling economies like Greece and Spain.\nBut their leader is not likely to greet Cameron's calls with enthusiasm. France under Francois Hollande has also abandoned its plans to oppose a real-terms increase, as have Britain's former allies Sweden and Finland.\nThat just leaves the UK joined by the Netherlands in threatening a veto as the talks approach.\nGermany is calling for the EU's budget to equate to one per cent of the EU's GDP - a switch which would lead to a real-terms increase.\nShadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the prime minister should have started to build up alliances in Europe \"months ago\", rather than starting now.\n\"Parliament has given him a mandate to push for a real term cuts in the EU budget and that is what he should focus on at today's meeting with Chancellor Merkel,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately David Cameron's threatening of vetos before talks have even begun will mean today's dinner will likely be spent trying to patch things up instead of really moving things forward.\""}

Once the women get to America, a kind doctor from Long Beach named Mona Devlin (Cherene Snow) tries to help them with group therapy and field trips.\n\"Black Dawn\" takes the form of a tone poem of misery, as the women recite the ghastly things that befell them, one at a time, or sometimes in unison (\"Knife knife/Slices sister's body\").\nColonomos presents the atrocities of Pol Pot, whose army killed more than 1 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979, as if recitation and repetition equaled revelation. The suffering of the women is not filtered through any kind of idea or insight, unless you count Mona Devlin's un-controversial belief that \"these women are prisoners of their minds and their memories\" and that \"sharing your memories will make them less painful.\" Devlin also lets us know that \"I believe people are the same no matter what race, color or creed,\" which is certainly reassuring.\nAt irregular intervals and for no discernible reason, Devlin speaks in third-person narration, as in the line, \" 'You're more than victim/survivors,' I said.' \" Director Jon Lawrence Rivera augments the play's suffocating poetry with an arty presentation, painting this terribly rudimentary drama in awed, hushed tones. But what choice does he have?\nThe drama is at times broken up by a golden-suited Goddess (Corinne Chooey) in a pagoda headdress who moves with the careful grace of traditional Cambodian dance, a form nearly lost under Pol Pot's genocide of artists. At about the middle of the 80-minute evening, the two men in the cast (Dom Magwili and K. Yukio Hayashi) don masks and cheerfully tell a parable about a woman who cheats on her husband, boils her hidden lover in a pot and then gets rid of some men she cons into helping her. The ominous story breaks up the usual gloom, but its dramatic purpose is misty.\nAs characters, the women are fairly indistinguishable except for the details of their individual horrors, though Christina Ma has an interesting, fresh poignancy as Mrs. Wang. As Devlin, Snow wrestles soberly and quietly with an impossible part, a healer with virtually no personality or ideas. She keeps her hands to her sides and looks concerned.\nDevlin is based on two doctors, Gretchen Van Boemel and Patricia Rozee, who did therapy work with Cambodian refugees in Southern California, after an unusual number of them were found to suffer from this post-trauma blindness.\nOne feels the playwright's heart is not in the healing process, but in the suffering itself. Some may believe that a naked and unprocessed pantomime of suffering does honor to the survivors of a horror, and it may.

We boarded our two-sailboat armada and headed for Ronde, an island about four miles north of Grenada, where the live reef made for spectacular free diving.\nIn the months before the trip, I\u2019d tried to whip myself into shape. At the gym, I\u2019d practiced what I figured were the free diving necessities: holding my breath and swimming. I\u2019d downloaded Apnea Trainer, an app that helps you improve your breathing technique. My wife bought me a smartwatch to count the number of laps I swam.\nBut the first day in Grenada, I realized my training hadn\u2019t been enough. I strapped on my fins and dive knife, goggles and snorkel and descended. I hovered at about 10 meters with my timer ticking. The filtered light cast shadows on the alien environment. The cool water forced a tinge of unease over my skin. I kept my eyes peeled for a hungry barracuda as curious fish swam by me, apparently unimpressed.\nLess than a minute into my dive, the blood began to pound in my head and my diaphragm began to twitch.

But that didn\u2019t add up: muscles and lungs don\u2019t change much in one week. So what had changed? Tracking down the answer exposed me as a closet dualist and led to a renewed respect for the depths of the brain.\nA few months after my Grenada trip, I sent an S.O.S. to the Association Internationale pour le D\u00e9velopement de l'Apn\u00e9e (AIDA; in English, the International Association for Development of Apnea), hoping to learn more about the free diving training process.

Of course, by this point it\u2019s no secret that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders would like to raise taxes exponentially. Analyst and author Rick J. Newman calls Sanders\u2019 plan \u201cso utopian as to be hopeless,\u201d noting that Sanders\u2019 goal of bringing in about $1.5 trillion in new tax revenue per year would boost the federal government\u2019s tax grab by about 46%.\nFor now, this is all in the realm of speculation. Sanders is giving idealistic speeches, and analysts and economists are crunching the numbers and making predictions. What\u2019s interesting, though, is how Sanders\u2019 tax-and-spend approach is mirrored in his home of Vermont \u2013 and to the state\u2019s detriment.\nLast month, the Vermont House of Representatives approved a $48 million hike in taxes and fees. The package, which is now in the hands of the Democrat-controlled Senate, would raise levies on a variety of items, including home heating oil and an Employer Health Assessment Tax on businesses who do not provide health insurance for their employees. If the bill gains approval by the Senate and then receives the blessing of Democratic Governor Peter Shumlin, it will be yet another anti-growth blow to a state that routinely loses residents (and their incomes) to states with lower tax burdens.\nThe $48 million tax hike comes on the heels of the $30 million tax increase Governor Shumlin approved last year, not to mention that 20-plus federal tax increases during the Obama Administration. With each hike, more individuals, families and businesses say goodbye to the Green Mountain State and look toward friendlier climates. Between 1992 and 2014, Vermont lost $566.78 million in net adjusted gross income (AGI) to Florida, which levies no individual state income tax.\nVermont is in no place to raise taxes even further, and the state\u2019s economic climate might serve as a microcosmic example of how a Bernie Sanders presidency might play out. The Tax Foundation\u2019s State Business Tax Climate Index ranks Vermont as the fifth-worst state in the nation when it comes to economic friendliness. High corporate taxes and high individual earnings taxes make the state unappealing to people hoping to start or keep a business in Vermont. The state\u2019s tax burden is widely viewed as excessive, and the probable $48 million hike does little to change that perception.\nWith 45 other states offering better business climates than Vermont, further increases seem almost unthinkable. Yet this is the myopic approach of leaders who think they can tax-and-spend their way into prosperity. That strategy does not work, on any level, and we should remain cautious of any representative, senator, governor, or presidential candidate who makes tax hikes such an integral part of their platform."}

{"idx": "7370", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The meeting provided some hints about what to expect from Make Music Madison, a citywide music event planned for June 21, 2013.\nMayor Paul Soglin emphasized three big themes during the \"Strengthening Madison Music\" town hall meeting last night at the Bartell Theatre: Madison's untapped musical potential, making sure local musicians can get paid and the refreshing power of music in new contexts, especially public spaces.\nThe meeting provided some hints about what to expect from Make Music Madison, a citywide music event planned for June 21, 2013. It offered few details on how Soglin might execute other music initiatives he hopes to fund through the city's next budget, which include another music festival and a music video promoting the city. Speaking of the budget, neither Soglin nor anyone in the audience mentioned that the meeting took place as the mayor and Common Council continue to battle over public funding for the Overture Center.\nThe town-hall panel was comprised of Soglin, Alder Scott J. Resnick, Madison Arts Commission chair Jose Madera and Make Music Madison organizer Michael Rothschild. The panel spent about a half-hour explaining Soglin's music proposals, then held a question-and-answer session with audience members. About 150 people attended.\nMake Music Madison, Rothschild explained, would place musicians in public spaces all over town on June 21, the summer solstice. It's inspired by Paris' F\u00eate de la Musique, and similar events that take place on the United States on the solstice. Rothschild, a retired UW-Madison business professor, said his nephew founded New York City's version, Make Music New York.\nIt was strange that nobody ever brought up Busking For Books, the Literacy Network fundraiser that places buskers all along State Street in the spring. Like the proposed Make Music Madison, it converts at least a part of the city into a surprising musical experience. It's a smaller-scale version of the \"continuous wall of music\" Make Music Madison promises on its website.\nDuring the meeting, nobody said much specific at all about the city potentially supporting a \"South By Southwest-style\" music festival, an option Soglin wants to explore via a $20,000 study. Soglin and Resnick were able to provide only a little more detail on the mayor's music video proposal. Soglin talked about one inspiration for the concept, a video in which the residents of Grand Rapids, Michigan, parade through their city singing \"American Pie.\"\nSoglin said his views about the Grand Rapids video had been \"grossly misinterpreted,\" which seemed to mean he doesn't envision Madison trying anything quite so hokey. \"We can do a million times better,\" he said. But Soglin also admitted it would be hard for Madisonians to build consensus as to how to create a video that best represents the city.\nEven during the more tense moments of the meeting's question-and-answer session, Soglin was soft-spoken and deferential. He was also short on specific answers. When one man asked how a music video would help local musicians, Soglin gave a rambling response: He talked about the benefits of cities located on \"active waterways,\" without demonstrating how a video would translate to tangible benefits for Madison musicians. The mayor even kept his humble cool when Brian Standing, who plays trombone in the Forward Marching Band, called out Soglin and the Common Council for passing an ordinance that appears to restrict buskers from asking people for money.\n"}

Missing from the squad for the West Indies are five of the stalwarts who carried them, if briefly, to the top of the ICC\u2019s Test charts and near the top in ODIs just over a year ago. Their places have been taken by younger, rising stars.\nThe West Indies have three prominent players on their absentee list; others with once settled places have been worryingly out of sorts in the regional Nagico Super50, presently into its final week in Trinidad. Another was withdrawn from the tournament by his association for declining to sign for his team outfit, as all their players are required to do.\nThe West Indies warm up for England\u2019s challenge with a couple of Twenty20s and one ODI against Ireland in Kingston February 19, 21 and 23; the Irish were so disappointing in the Trinidad tournament over the past 10 days that it presents an ideal opportunity to introduce the most promising newcomers.\nIt\u2019s all the more reason to expect the England matches to feature those of the coming generation. That alone heightens the expectations.\nFor the West Indies, Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy are still carrying injuries. Gayle hasn\u2019t played any cricket since November 21 when he tore a hamstring in the first ODI in Kochi on the back-to-back tours of India and New Zealand that were every bit as ill-starred as England\u2019s in Australia.\nSammy, also with a hamstring problem, and Samuels, recovering from an operation to correct a chronic wrist injury, haven\u2019t had a match since last Boxing Day.\nNormally, selectors would not hurry them back against international opposition. The West Indies panel\u2019s conservatism in favouring the tried and trusted over the young and untested is clear from those players contracted for 2014.\nAt the top level, worth US$120,000 each, are Gayle, 35, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 39, both with strong records but clearly in the twilight of their careers.\nAlso there are Samuels, 33, who followed his outstanding 2012 with an inconsistent 2013, Sammy, the Test and Twenty20 captain whose position, even by his own admission, is \u201con the line\u201d, and Dwayne Bravo, 30, whose last of 40 Tests was more than three years ago.\nThe only under 30 at that group at 25 is Sunil Narine, the mystery spinner.\nAmong those two levels below (at US$60,000) are Darren Bravo and Denesh Ramdin, along with Johnson Charles, Kirk Edwards, Kieran Powell, Ravi Rampaul and Shane Shillingford.\n\u2018Lil Bravo, as he\u2019s called in his native Trinidad, is 25 and the team\u2019s finest young batsman who averages 44.68 in 27 Tests with the highest of his five hundreds, 218 against New Zealand, just three matches ago.\nRamdin has finally cemented himself as wicket-keeper/batsman after a"}

{"idx": "7376", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The global media headlined on June 3 a political exercise conducted in Assad regime-controlled areas of Syria. Most reports described it as Syrian presidential elections with three candidates and a likely winner, the incumbent Bashar al-Assad. The exercise was illustrated with endless photos even videos of Syrians, described as voters, appearing to caste a vote. Coverage was far from flattering but plenty of coverage there was.\nSo, was this news? A pretty cast iron case could be made that the media should have ignored the regime\u2019s games and concentrated on the genuine news story that is the conflict, the bombings and humanitarian disaster. The barrel bombs and bullets are real whilst the ballots are not. It is more than a sneaking suspicion that even the most reputable of journalists succumbed to the offer of a regime visa.\nIt was not just the media. Western political leaders opposed to Assad, even whilst tagging it as a sham or parody of democracy, used similar language. One wonders why American and French ministers interrupted their busy schedules to comment.\nYet given that it was not ignored, just how should the media have covered it? How should politicians outside Syria react?\nTo start with, do not buy into the regime\u2019s framing of these events.\nFixed elections are not elections at all. Votes that do not count are not votes. National elections that take place only in areas under the control of one party to a conflict are not national. How can one be a \u201ccandidate,\u201d \u201copponent\u201d or a \u201ccompetitor\u201d in a race that is already decided? The other two faces, on what was described as a ballot paper, seemed more than content that Assad was, how should we say, reaffirmed as president. In this particular drama, the two others were no more than bridesmaids trailing behind a naked Emperor.\nTo list all the glaring discrepancies and violations would be to give the whole charade more credibility than it could ever deserve. Suffice it to say that the observers from Russia and Zimbabwe would not have been shocked even if the North Korean delegation might have felt it was all a little bit liberal.\nThe problem is to use the term \u201celections\u201d on such occasions inevitably skews coverage, suggesting even the possibility of a legitimate exercise. Putting forth \u201cboth sides of the story,\u201d juxtaposing regime and opposition views about whether these were \u201celections,\u201d as some media outfits do, entertains a debate that should not be had. It is not a challenge unique to Syria.\nThe English dictionary is desperately seeking a new word (all ideas welcome!) to describe these 90 percent plus rubber stamp affairs. Even what happened in North Korea where one man got 100 percent of the vote with 100 percent turnout was still referred to in the media as an election, albeit often bookended by inverted commas. There needs to be one word that acquires widespread acceptance in the mainstream media. Coronation is too positive a term. Perhaps a respected institution could devise precise yardsticks by which a political event attains the gold standard of an election or referendum.\nDoes it matter? It should not, but regimes have co-opted for their own ends the democratic lexicon of elections, votes and candidates. Everyone knows that Russia, China and Iran will all tout Assad as the democratically elected legitimate Syrian leader, who therefore cannot be expected to stand down or even share power. The oft-repeated narrative is this will somehow strengthen the regime. One wonders how? Bashar al-Assad will be as illegitimate a president on June 4 as he was on June"}

Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption continues to be a big seller, while the Wii dominates the top 10 list and the Xbox 360 sees a big boost. Let's take a look at the numbers.\nFor the second month in a row the top selling game is the 360 version of Red Dead Redemption. In its second month the game managed to move around 580,000 units. The only other 360 game to chart in the top 10 was UFC 2010: Undisputed, which took the number eight spot. Meanwhile, in terms of hardware, the 360 came in second, trailing only the Nintendo DS, moving an estimated 450,000 consoles. That's up by over a quarter of a million from last month. This jump is no doubt due to the recently released slim version of the 360.\nWhen it comes to software, the same exact two games made the chart for Sony, though in lower positions. The PS3 version of RDR took the third spot, selling around 380,000 copies, while UFC 2010: Undisputed on the PS3 took the tenth spot. As for hardware, the PS3 and PSP took the fourth and fifth spots respectively, though both saw sales increases compared to last month. The PS3 sold 304,000, more than doubling last month's numbers, while the PSP moved 121,000 handhelds, for an increase of 60,000.\nThe rest of the software chart was unsurprisingly dominated by Nintendo games. Super Mario Galaxy took the second spot with nearly 550,000 units sold, while New Super Mario Bros. Wii (4), Just Dance (5), Wii Fit Plus (6), and LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 (9) round out the list. The lone DS game to chart was Toy Story 3, which placed in the number seven spot.\nThe DS continues to dominate the hardware sales numbers, taking first spot with over 500,000 units sold. The Wii, meanwhile, was the only console to see a drop in sales compared to last month. It placed third with 422,000 units sold, down 87,000 from May.\nThe introduction of the slim 360 clearly had a big impact on sales, though not quite enough to push the system past the DS. Or much ahead of the slumping Wii, for that matter. Meanwhile, RDR continues to sell steadily, on both the 360 and the PS3. In its first two months the game has sold nearly 2.5 million copies across both systems. June also marks the month that Pokemon has finally dropped out of the top 10, though with the recent release of Dragon Quest IX, it may not be long before we see another DS RPG make the list. Overall, the game industry is down 9 percent year-to-date versus 2009."}

Ring-billed gulls follow coastlines and river systems when migrating, according to the National Audubon Society. They aren't considered endangered.\nThe Plant Science Research and Education Unit is located in Citra, about 30 miles southeast of Gainesville. It allows researchers to study new crops and growing techniques. Projects at the unit include crops like citrus, watermelon and peanuts.\nBut the cranes and gulls had damaged or eaten crops growing for research, including high-value peanuts that were part of a breeding study, said Jim Boyer, director of the unit.\nThe gulls were taken between 2008 and 2017.

Now, the government is introducing new yellow taxis.\nFor many visitors to Cairo, their most memorable experience is not their visit to the Giza pyramids or even the Egyptian Museum's Tutankhamen exhibit. It's the city's taxis.\nTo engage one of these exhaust-spewing cars, you bellow your destination as it careens by. If it stops, you jump in, soon finding yourself bumping along in a rickety, grime-encrusted 1970s vehicle, often lacking rearview mirrors and door handles.\nAt the end of the ride, the 30-year-old meter is still frozen at 10 cents per kilometer. So the driver determines the fare based on your nationality, fluency in Arabic, and insider knowledge. Arguments are not uncommon.\nBut this tradition - so much a part of any visitor's experience in this city of pharaonic antiquities and largely ignored traffic lights - may become a thing of the past.\nEarlier this year, the Egyptian government launched a fleet of spanking-new yellow taxis complete with air conditioning, credit-card-friendly meters (that work), phones, seat belts, spotless vinyl seating, rear- and side-view mirrors, windows that close, doors that open, and drivers in suits and ties who don't smoke, blast the radio, or yell.\nThe government hopes that these cars (and drivers) will be more welcoming for the country's citizens and tourists alike.\n\"We want taxis with a more civilized appearance, to offer our citizens and tourists more comfort,\" says Gen. Mahmoud Yassin Ibrahim, Cairo's vice governor.\nUntil the new taxis were introduced, Cairo offered three main public transport options besides the black-and-white cabs with their busted taillights: sardine-stuffed buses, death-defying minibuses, and a surprisingly clean and efficient metro, complete with women-only cars to protect female passengers from jeering males.\nIn addition to adding an appealing alternative to the mix, the new taxis could also help alleviate the pervasive pollution of desert dust, factory fumes, and car exhaust in this growing megalopolis of 16 million, since the government is considering fueling the vehicles with natural gas.\nPlans to gradually replace Cairo's 70,000 black-and-white cabs have been in the pipeline for a while, but it wasn't until Egypt's reform-minded Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif took office in 2004 that implementation began in earnest. The government chose three private companies to operate the 150 new Volkswagen Paratis and Hyundai Elantras - a fleet it plans to increase 10-fold by the end of the year.\nCustomers pay 60 cents for the first kilometer in the new taxis, and then 17 cents for each additional kilometer. And rather than yelling their destination as these cabs speed past, customers can call for service or go to any of the city's 36 taxi stations.\nI went down to Tahrir Square - one of Cairo's loudest, most crowded, and hottest centers - on a recent afternoon to see how this service was catching on.\nAt the new taxi station there, three glistening yellow cabs stood neatly in line, contrasting starkly with the noisy, dusty haze of jockeying cars, trucks, motor sc"}

Conducted by Harvard Business School and London Business School/MLab, the NASA-TopCoder Challenge asked TopCoder members to create improved mathematical algorithms to determine the optimal contents of medical kits for future human exploration missions. The experiment delivered a cost effective set of improvements to a critical NASA Space Life Science Directorate application, which will be used to reduce the risk associated with manned space flight.\nOverall, TopCoder members delivered 2,833 distinct code submissions during the course of the competition and produced numerous enhanced solutions that NASA will adapt for use in its International Space Station missions as soon as early next year. Among the 1,095 participating, top solution providers were Blazde of the UK, Chokudai and Imazato of Japan, Marcadian of Indonesia and WLeite of Brazil. The competition offered $24,000 in cash prizes.\nProfessor Karim Lakhani of Harvard Business School and Professor Kevin Boudreau of London Business School/MLab joined with TopCoder and NASA to help design the experiment and monitored and analyzed the TopCoder Marathon Match competition output and results from a distributed innovation perspective. The pilot research project was funded by grants from the London Business School/MLab and the Harvard Business School.\nThe NASA-TopCoder Challenge was the first time the TopCoder community of more than 250,000 software enthusiasts was utilized by NASA. Long-duration human exploration missions such as those being planned for the International Space Station, Moon, and Mars, will require higher levels of pre-planning and more analysis of available data than ever before. Physiologic modeling applications and mission simulation programs are algorithmically-intensive as flight surgeons and mission planners explore and evaluate medical scenarios that might occur on long-duration missions. Categories for analysis included Mass, Volume, Probability of Evacuation, Crew Health Index (a NASA derived number that measures the quality of crew life), and probability of loss of crew. In this experiment, competitors developed algorithms to help NASA's flight surgeons make decisions involved with optimizing the contents of the medical supplies kit that may one day be carried onboard long-duration space missions. The submissions were compared with the results of an existing computer model that has simulated the expected medical occurrences and outcomes for various mission scenarios.\nThe Space Life Sciences Directorate (SLSD) is an organization at JSC focusing on medical, health, biology, and biotechnology related aspects of manned space flight. Its mission statement is \"To optimize human health and productivity for space exploration.\" All Space Life Sciences human health and countermeasures research, medical operations, habitability and environmental factors activities, and directorate support functions are ultimately aimed at achieving this mission.

That's three pairs of hands to share the load and, especially given that we're all flexibly self-employed and close friends, it means that life runs pretty smoothly most of the time.\nLast month, for example, we decided to make the most of the sudden burst of late-summer weather, as well as the fact that I had a bit of time off from Coronation Street, and all head down to the country for the week. Georgia loved having all her parents (and one set of grandparents) around, and the three of us enjoyed chilling together and spoiling her, making the most of these last few months of \"her-only childhood\".\nLast week I found myself in the highly unusual position of being a single parent. Cam had gone back to Canada for his mum and dad's 50th wedding anniversary, while Catherine had a number of work things to deal with. She's also entering the third trimester of pregnancy, and is at the stage where she tires easily, particularly as an older mother-to-be, so I took Georgia home with me for three days.\nAside from the obvious lone-parenting issues \u2013 plonking your child in front of Peppa Pig while you go to the loo with the door open, for example \u2013 the biggest difference was being able to create our own timetable.\nI didn't have to meet Catherine or Cam for hand-overs or meal times, so Georgia and I could pootle through the day at our own pace, going wherever the mood took us. Because, of course, the down side of three parents is that there are three people's schedules and needs to consider. So, for those few days, much as I love Catherine, much as I miss Cam, having Georgia all to myself was a rare treat.\nYes, I know how spoilt that sounds. I'm sure there are countless single parents reading this and rolling their eyes. I have plenty of friends who really are bring up children alone, so I'm well aware that the reality of single parenting, day in, day out, is that it can be stressful, exhausting and lonely.\nThe time alone with my daughter felt like a luxury precisely because I don't have to do it all the time. I don't have to struggle out of bed seven days a week, regardless of how I feel, I don't have to juggle work and childcare and shopping and cooking, while trying to cling to the vestiges of a social life. I have it easy and so, when I do get Georgia to myself, I make the most of it. In fact, I wallow in it \u2013 playing and snuggling and enjoying every minute of her two-year-old cuteness. The fact that I also have to spend so much time away in Manchester filming the TV show only serves to make time alone with Georgia feel even more like a luxury.\nI wonder again how I'll manage to love the new baby with the same ferocity with which I love Georgia. Even though I know rationally that I will, and everyone tells me \"babies bring their own love\", it still seems unfathomable.\nBefore Georgia was born, I had a clear picture of what fatherhood would be like, but this time, when I try to think ahead to being a father of two, my imagination fails, and I struggle to see it emotionally or practically. I am excited about the new baby, but I'm apprehensive, too.\nRight now, fatherhood feels so perfect that the thought of any change makes me nervous."}

You also are supposed to give employees a copy of their W-2 form, so they can file their tax return with the IRS -- and, if applicable -- the state and local government. As of 2012, employees filing 250 or more W-2s with the SSA must do so electronically, unless they are granted a waiver by the Internal Revenue Service. For state and local W-2 filing, apply the respective administering agency\u2019s guidelines.\nThe Social Security Administration requires that you file annual paper W-2s by the last day of February each year; depending on the year, this could be on the 28th or the 29th. Electronic W-2s are due by March 31. The state might require that you file W-2s within the same time frame as mandated by the SSA. Or it might set one filing deadline for both electronic and paper filing. Check with the state revenue agency for clarification on when W-2s are due. You are supposed to distribute W-2s to your employees by Jan. 31.\nBefore you file W-2s, verify that you are required to do so. You should file a W-2 for employees to whom you paid wages and from whom you withheld income tax, Medicare tax or Social Security tax; or for employees from whom income tax would have been deducted if they had not claimed exemption from withholding or if they had claimed a maximum of one withholding allowance on their W-4 form. You must generally file a W-2 for each employee to which you paid wages, even if that employee is related to you.\nIf an employee\u2019s W-2 is incorrect and you already filed it with the administering agency, promptly make the correction on Form W-2c after discovering the error. File the W-2c with the Social Security Administration. If the W-2c is only for changes to an employee\u2019s state or local income tax withholding, file the form with the state or local revenue agency; do not file it with the SSA. There is no required frequency for filing W-2cs. You would simply file the form whenever you detect an error on an employee\u2019s W-2. If you expect to file multiple W-2cs, to reduce administrative time and costs, try to file them all at once.\nWhen filing annual W-2s, file a W-3 form as well.

With their 4-2 loss to the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday, the Sabres become the first team in league history to finish in 31st place.\nCalling this season a disaster would be putting it lightly. With just 11 wins at KeyBank Center, the Sabres tie a franchise record for the fewest wins on home ice in a season. What's even worse -- that stat includes seasons shortened by the lockout(s). It's safe to say the 2017-2018 team will go down as one of the worst teams in franchise history.\nAs we've said with Mittelstadt since his arrival in Buffalo, forming an opinion on a player after just a few games is unfair. That said, Nylander left plenty to be desired after his 2017-2018 Sabres debut.\nIn the first period, Nylander was gift wrapped two quality chances on the same shift, failing to convert on both. In the second period, Nylander picked up the puck in the defensive zone and had just one defender to beat. Instead, he was pickpocketed by Senators third line center Zack Smith.\nAn impressive outing for Nylander in the next two games would be nice to see. But his performance in the summer will be what makes or breaks his chances of making the team out of training camp.\nIn his four games with the Sabres, Casey Mittelstadt has some pretty weird assists. On Wednesday Mittelstadt tallied his third helper in four games on Kyle Okposo's goal. While Mittelstadt still hasn't found the back of the net, he's making some nice plays at both ends of the ice.\nAs with Nylander, a big summer for Mittelstadt will go a long way. I'm expecting Mittelstadt to make the team out of training camp. But if the Sabres are going to improve, they'll need some serious production out of their 19-year-old forward.\nIt says a lot that Victor Antipin was the rookie of the year on this team. That's not so much a knock on him, but an indication of how little production the Sabres got from their younger players. As for Girgensons, he was asked to do a lot this season, moving up and down the lineup. While he didn't produce offensively, Girgensons worked his tail off nearly every time he was on the ice.\nFor those who aren't caught up, the NHL Draft lottery works a little different these days.

Its share price has surged more than 600 percent in the past year.\nIn October, Fingerprint was caught up in a hoax following a fake press release which claimed Samsung was buying the company for $650 million.\nThe Swedish Economic Crime Authority launched a fraud probe. Carlstrom declined to comment on the case on Wednesday, saying that an investigation was underway.\nFingerprint\u2019s revenues have been dominated by sales of fingerprint security products to Chinese banks like Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\nBut in the third quarter of this year, more than 50 percent of revenues came from mobile phones, Carlstrom said, a trend the company expects will continue.\nThe group expects to secure a 60 percent share of the smartphone market for touch sensors in 2014 and 2015, excluding Apple smartphones.\nThe smartphone market is growing rapidly. Worldwide smartphone shipments are forecast to grow 40 percent year-over- year to more than 1.0 billion units this year, according to International Data Corporation.\nLast year, when Apple bought fingerprint sensor developer AuthenTec for $356 million this was viewed as a signal that the technology would finally go mainstream.\n\u201cIt was an industry breakthrough and certainly opens the flood gates and starts a new industry,\u201d Carlstrom said.\nHe said that Apple, which also looked at Fingerprint back in 2010 when it was eyeing AuthenTec, sets the agenda for smartphone makers when it comes to functionality and design.\nAsked if he would be open to a sale, Carlstrom said that given the industry\u2019s growth potential, he believed the company -"}

As ProPublica has documented, Obama has overall granted clemency at a lower rate than any modern president, which includes both commutations \u2013 early release \u2013 and pardons. Last year, ProPublica reported that the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney rarely gives positive clemency recommendations to the president. Experts have been calling for reform of the entire clemency process.\n\u201cHolder\u2019s speech begs the question, why is not more attention given to the broken pardons office?\u201d said Robert Ehrlich, a former Republican governor of Maryland who recently started a law clinic devoted to pardons.\nOne person who is still waiting to hear about his petition for commutation is Clarence Aaron. He has been in prison since 1993, when he was sentenced to three life terms for his role in a drug deal. Aaron was not the buyer, seller, nor supplier of the drugs. It was his first criminal offense.\nFor now, Holder\u2019s initiative has little to offer prisoners already behind bars. He directed prosecutors to avoid charges that carried mandatory minimum sentences for certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders and urged the passage of legislation to change those sentencing requirements. But in 2010, there weremore than 75,000 people in federal custody that had been given mandatory sentences.\nWhile clemency does not generally reach wide swaths of prisoners, Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter used it to affect policy on a larger scale, creating programs toforgive thousands of Vietnam War draft evaders.\nIn the 1960s, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy also took a stand against what he described as \u201cgrossly unjust\u201d outcomes of sentencing practices \u2013 and used commutations to do so. He directed federal prison wardens to seek out and bring himprisoners deserving of early release. Kennedy acknowledged that presidential commutations were \u201cat best only stop-gaps\u201d in a sentencing regime that needed reform. President John F. Kennedy commuted 100 sentences in total, and President Lyndon B.

(AP) \u2014 Andy Grove, the former Intel Corp. chief executive whose youth under Nazi occupation and escape from the Iron Curtain inspired an \"only the paranoid survive\" management philosophy that saved the chip maker from financial ruin in the 1980s, has died. He was 79.\nIntel said Grove died on Monday. It did not specify a cause of death.\nGrove, who was instrumental in building Intel into the world's largest chip company during his 37-year career there, had suffered from Parkinson's disease. He also suffered from prostate cancer in the mid-1990s.\nHe was a mercurial but visionary leader who helped position Intel's microprocessors as the central technology inside personal computers.\nGrove's bet-the-company gamble \u2014 moving Intel from memory chips to microprocessors in the mid-1980s to serve what was still a fledgling PC industry \u2014 helped rescue Intel from a financial crisis and set it on course to becoming one of the most profitable and important technology companies of all time.\n\"Andy made the impossible happen, time and again, and inspired generations of technologists, entrepreneurs, and business leaders,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said Monday.\nRobert Burgelman, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business who started teaching management classes with Grove in the late 1980s, called Grove \"one of the most incisive thinkers that I have ever come across.\" He said Grove's technical and strategic abilities were critical in building Intel and fending off threats from Asian competitors.\n\"I don't think Intel would have been Intel as we know it, and therefore the U.S. chip industry would not have been what it is\" without Grove, Burgelman said.\nIntel created the world's first commercial microprocessor in 1971, but the company's primary focus was memory chips for mainframe computers. That was until the personal computer was invented and a new use for Intel's microprocessors emerged.\nGrove's leadership of that transition affirmed his status as a key figure in the digital revolution and an icon of business leadership, whose maneuvers have been studied and dissected in management classes around the world.\nYet Grove, known at times as combative and vindictive to those who crossed him, was also pilloried for his role in one of the biggest missteps in Intel's history: the company's intransigence after a major calculating flaw was discovered in 1994 in Intel's flagship Pentium microprocessor, an error that Intel had known about but deemed too insignificant too fix.\nGrove's response to the outcry was to require customers who wanted to return flawed chips to call Intel and convince the company they needed a replacement. He later capitulated and set aside nearly a half-billion dollars for a no-questions-asked exchange program.\nHis mentality helped shape a strict, often caustic management style that is now as much a part of Silicon Valley lore as Grove's relentless focus on sharpening Intel's technological advantages.\nGrove wrote several well-received books, including \"Only the Paranoid Survive,\" a 1996 treatise on the science of managing crises, and his 2001 autobiography, \"Swimming Across,\" a harrowing memoir of Grove's childhood.

Specifically, we put forth the question: Should brick-and-mortar research be applied to digital commerce more often? The answers were somewhat surprising.\n\"It's about time,\" remarked Alison Grippo, principal of digital strategy at the Sullivan agency. \"Customers don't perceive brands differently online or offline. They expect the same quality irrespective of channel. And this is something that no longer is limited to what we typically call consumer brands.\"\nDavid Bozin, vp of growth development at local shopping app Bindo, agreed. \"To think that shopping online is a [completely] different experience than in person is an incorrect assessment of human nature,\" he said. \"Quite the contrary is true. We like what we like, and that is what leads us to buy.\"\nSo while retailers for the last several years have made their store layouts more reflective of their social media presences, Crate & Barrel seems to show the opposite approach can work as well: Learning about the way consumers move around the store can help create better site navigation. Marketers of all stripes may want to mimic those efforts, suggested Grippo.\n\"In our recent survey of executives that shop for business products online, the findings suggest that online [business-to-business] shopping experiences need to match the way they're sold by salespeople or on the ground at a conference,\" she said.\nVirtual reality, Gen Y messaging apps and wearables seem to get all the hype nowadays, but e-retail is still incredibly ripe for innovation and investment.

According to CUES (Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea), a code adopted in 2014 by navies from 21 countries including Japan and the ROK, aiming fire control radars is considered a simulation of attack and is stipulated as an action a commander might avoid.\nThe fire-control radar detection sound is available here. The search radar detection sound is available here. Note: Parts of the sound are processed for information security.\nThe Ministry had previously released video footage of the incident which occurred at around 3 p.m. (JST) on December 20, 2018, within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. A fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1) belonging to the Fleet Air Wing 4 of the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) was allegedly irradiated by a fire-control radar from a South Korean Navy destroyer off the coast of the Noto Peninsula, Japan. The plane was observing the destroyer and an ROK patrol and rescue vessel.\nUpon analysis of the frequency, intensity, waveform, etc. of the radar waves, Japan's MOD says it has confirmed that the P-1 was continuously irradiated for a certain period, multiple times by the fire-control radar (STIR-180) of the ROK destroyer that was being photographed. The STIR-180 was not mounted on the patrol and rescue vessel that was nearby at the time, and the MOD says the fact the ROK destroyer directed its radar is clear from the video footage.\nSouth Korea has denied that the incident occurred and has demanded that Japan \"stop distorting facts\" and \"apologize for conducting a threateningly low-altitude flight.\"\nJapan's MOD says it is necessary that a comprehensive assessment is made using the ROK's data regarding the detailed capability of the fire-control radar equipped on the ROK destroyer - as a matter of reciprocity. The MOD requested this on January 14, but the proposal was rejected. On January 15, Japan claims that a spokesperson from ROK's Ministry of National Defense denounced the MOD's proposals as \"extremely rude.\"\nThe ROK claims that the MSDF P-1 conducted \"a threateningly low-altitude flight\" in the vicinity of a ROK destroyer conducting a \"humanitarian rescue mission\", and is demanding an apology.\nThere is no international law that directly regulates the minimum safety altitude for military aircrafts, but in order to ensure safety, the MSDF operates under Japan's domestic law that conforms to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and did not conduct any flight that may threaten the ROK destroyer. It is our understanding that normal operations by the U.S. Forces and NATO are carried out under similar standards.\nIn fact, as apparent from the footage released by the MOD on December 28 and the MSDF P-1's track chart, the MSDF P-1 maintained a sufficiently safe altitude (approx. 150m) and distance (approx. 500m) from the ROK destroyer even at its closest, and did not conduct flight that may interrupt the ROK destroyer's activities.

His declaration in Burkina Faso last November that \u201cAfrican heritage can\u2019t just be in European private collections and museums\u201d reignited the debate around colonial artefacts.\nMacron has since asked two independent experts, the French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy and the Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr, to draw up a set of recommendations for repatriation; their report is due in November. But a question mark hangs over how the policy will be implemented.\nThe French culture ministry is typically hostile to any changes on matters of restitution. \u201cIn 2010, the French parliament voted to set up a scientific commission to study proposals for repatriation, but the ministry failed to act,\u201d the journalist Vincent Noce reported earlier this year, explaining that curators at French museums fiercely defend the principle of inalienability.\nYves-Bernard Debie, a Brussels-based lawyer specialising in cultural property and trade, believes that Macron\u2019s proposal \u2014 considered by some as a masterstroke of cultural diplomacy \u2014 is ill-founded. \u201cBy anchoring the question of sharing world cultural property in the context of \u2018restitution\u2019, President Macron has sparked a fire that he will have a great deal of trouble extinguishing,\u201d he says.\nThe Quai Branly-Jacques Chirac museum has a collection of more than 70,000 artefacts from sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the works are caught up in restitution claims. In July 2016, the Benin government called for the return of Guezo, Glele and Behanzin treasures in the collection; the disputed items were seized by the French army in 1892 from the royal palaces of Abomey located in the present-day Republic of Benin in west Africa.

For one, there are actors, musicians, politicians and all other sorts of celebrities and public figures who use Facebook Pages as their main account. Some might not make their personal Facebook profiles public. Others might not even have a personal profile at all.\nBefore this change, various public figures and brands could have been prohibited from interacting with their fans or supporters within Facebook Groups. Now that Pages can join groups, Facebook might soon see verified Pages with millions of \u201clikes\u201d interact on a more personal level within Groups.\nPage owners using the Page itself in Facebook Group can now also possibly see an uptick in likes due to these interactions as opposed to friend requests on their personal profiles from users they may barely even know. Page owners can now build the brand they properly want to use within Groups instead of being forced to use personal profiles which Facebook requires a real name to use.\nWith the positives from these changes, there\u2019s bound to be some negatives, too. Hiding behind a random Page name as opposed to your real name on a profile is bound to lead to some abuse. And Facebook seems to have prepared for that.

{"idx": "7428", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Trade-offs apply to our economic lives, as well as our political lives. That means getting more of one thing requires giving up something else. Let's look at some examples.\nBlack congressmen and black public officials in general, including Barack Obama, always side with teachers unions in their opposition to educational vouchers, tuition tax credits, charter schools and other measures that would allow black parents to take their children out of failing public schools. Most black politicians and many black professionals take the position of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is on record as saying, \"We shouldn't abandon the public schools.\"\nTaking such a political stance is understandable because black congressmen and other black elected officials are part of a coalition. As such, they are expected to vote for things that other coalition members want in order that those coalition members vote for things that black politicians want. There's no question that these black public officials are getting something in return for their support of teachers unions and others who benefit from the educational status quo. The question not addressed by black people is whether what black politicians are getting for their support of a failed educational system is worth the sacrifice of whole generations of black youngsters, educationally handicapping them and making many virtually useless in the high-tech world of the 21st century.\nThough many black politicians mouth that we should fix, not abandon, public schools, they themselves have abandoned public schools. They see their children as too precious to be sacrificed in the name of public education. While living in Chicago, Barack Obama sent his daughters to the prestigious University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When he moved to Washington, President Obama enrolled his daughters in the prestigious Sidwell Friends School. According to a report by The Heritage Foundation, \"exactly 52 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members and 38 percent of Congressional Hispanic Caucus members sent at least one child to private school.\" Overall, only 6 percent of black students attend private school.\nIt's not just black politicians who fight tooth and nail against parental school choice and have their children in private schools. When President Obama's White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel resigned and became mayor of Chicago, he did not enroll his children in the Windy City's public schools. He enrolled his son and two daughters in the University of Chicago Lab Schools. And members of Congress, regardless of race, are three to four times likelier than the public to send their children to private schools.\nAccording to a 2004 Thomas B. Fordham Institute study, more than 1 in 5 public school teachers sent their children to private schools. In some cities, the figure is much higher. In Philadelphia, 44 percent of the teachers put their children in private schools; in Cincinnati, it's 41 percent, and Chicago (39 percent) and Rochester, N.Y. (38 percent), also have high figures. In the San Francisco-Oakland area, 34 percent of public school teachers enroll their children in private schools, and in New York City, it's 33 percent.\nOnly 11 percent of all parents enroll their children in private schools.

As Hayley Platt reports her comment raised hackles in the industry and in Italy where the food spread is made.\nIt's been a firm favourite among foodies for generations. But the gooey hazelnut spread Nutella came close to causing a diplomatic dingdong over its use of palm oil. It's a popular ingredient in many products, and huge swathes of forest in Indonesia and Malaysia have to be cleared to grow it. French environment minister and former partner of President Holland, Segolene Royal says that's ruining the planet. And even suggested people should stop eating Nutella to help save the environment. But her comments didn't go down well with the industry or fans of the brand. (SOUNDBITE) (French) NUTELLA FAN, EVA BOUSTAOUI, SAYING: \"Nutella is an institution. You can't cut out Nutella, cars - maybe we can make an effort with cars, but Nutella's chocolate not something that's going to ruin the environment.\" Segolene Royal has since apologised for her comments. Ferrero says only 20 percent of the spread is palm oil and they only buy it from sustainable sources. Justin Urquart-Stewart is from Seven Investment Management. SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) SEVEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, MARKET ANALYST, JUSTIN URQUHART-STEWART, SAYING: \"Of course it will have an impact, it's inevitable but attacking individual products like this does very little. It would be much better to look at what is happening to the development of palm oil and how you can make that more acceptable, in terms of not just the environment, not just globally but locally as well in terms of those economies.\" It's not the first time the Nutella brand has hit the headlines in France. In 2012 a bill dubbed the 'Nutella Tax' proposed quadrupling the tax on palm oil. It was eventually rejected. This time support for the brand stretched to the Italian prime minister's wife, Agnese Renzi who paid a trip to the Nutella bar at the Milan Expo world fair. Michelle Obama followed her to the fair, which focusses on food, nutrition and world hunger issues.

The new gates will allow the city to better control public access to the site.\nThe project is rooted in ongoing security concerns. In January 2010, two Glendale men were stabbed on the Brand Park basketball courts. And in 2007, a 21-year-old opened fire on a group of men, striking a nearby car carrying four people. No one was hurt.\nSubsequently, the Northwest Glendale Homeowners Assn. called on the city to enhance security measures. The City Council approved $711,000 in upgrades to lighting, tree trimming and fencing. A ranger also was temporarily stationed at the park to provide a security presence.\nThe new gates will be located at the main entryway at Mountain Street and El Miradero Avenue and at a driveway further west near Mountain Street and Western Avenue, said city architectural specialist Layla Bettar.\nThe main entryway dates back to 1913, when the Brand family added the east wing to what is now known as the Brand Library. As it exists today, the main entryway includes unlocked pedestrian gates. It does not have gates across the roadways, leaving the park open 24 hours a day. The secondary driveway currently includes only a fire gate.\nThe new gates would be locked when the park is closed, from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.\n\u201cThe main purpose of the gates is to keep cars from coming into the park after closing hours,\u201d Bettar said.\nThe new gates will be set back slightly to give aesthetic priority to the existing gates and walls, Bettar said. The new gating at the main entrance will not be affixed to the entryway\u2019s historic white columns, but rather to new support posts, she added.\nAt the west entrance to the park, the city plans to install a rolling gate so that when it is open, it will not be visible from the street, Bettar said.\nThe total cost for the project has not yet been calculated, she added.\nSome commissioners expressed support for the plans.\nBut other commissioners said they would like to see the design of the new gates match the decorative ironwork of the 1913 originals.\nThe design proposal will undergo further modifications before returning to the commission in the coming months."}
{"idx": "7437", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Will Intel Score an Apple Inc. iPhone Modem Win After All?\nIntel may be inside of a lower-cost iPhone set to hit the market next year, according to one Street analyst.\nIn a research report obtained by Barron's, Raymond James' Hans Mosesmann claims that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will, indeed, start selling cellular modems to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) next year. The analyst cites \"multiple [Silicon] Valley data points\" suggesting that Intel has succeeded in convincing Apple to adopt its upcoming XMM 7360 stand-alone cellular modem.\nMosesmann, citing his colleague Travis McCourt, says that Intel's initial \"incursions\" into Apple's iPhone supply chain will be in lower-end devices (i.e. successor to the iPhone 5c) in 2016 with the potential to get into the flagship devices in 2017 \"at the earliest.\"\nDoes this make sense? Let's take a closer look.\nXMM 7360 in a lower-cost phone?\nThe upcoming flagship Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus models are expected to feature Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) MDM9x35 cellular modems. These chips offer theoretical peak download speeds of 300 megabits per second and upload speeds of 50 megabits per second.\nThe Intel XMM 7360 actually offers maximum theoretical download and upload speeds of 450 megabits per second and 100 megabits per second, respectively, which is actually the kind of capability that I would expect to see in the flagship iPhone 7/7 Plus devices that will likely launch in the fall of 2016.\nThat said, if Apple plans to launch three new iPhone models in the fall of 2016 (4-inch, 4.7-inch, and 5.5-inch), then I could see Qualcomm winning the 4.7/5.5-inch models exclusively with Intel and Qualcomm splitting the orders for the 4-inch model.\nXMM 7460 potentially going for flagship iPhones?\nI expect that Intel will formally reveal its next generation stand-alone modem, the XMM 7460, in early 2016 (possibly at the Mobile World Congress event in February). The modem itself will probably begin sampling in late 2015/early 2016 for volume production during the second half of 2016.\nIn addition to a feature set that should be enough for an iPhone that launches in 2017, Intel will have the advantage of manufacturing this modem on its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. As I have written about in the past, this should put Intel's offerings on even footing with what Qualcomm will be offering in terms of manufacturing technology, eliminating an advantage that Qualcomm's modems currently have over Intel's.\nIt's probably too soon to tell whether Intel will actually be able to win some of the orders for a flagship iPhone that's two years out, but I suspect that Intel's mobile group is working feverishly to make \"Intel Inside\" Apple's iPhones a reality.\nWhat kind of financial impact could we be looking at?\nIntel's mobile business is currently in financial hot water; the division is likely generating minimal revenue (in the quarter before Intel folded it in with its PC Client Group, its Mobile and Communications Group generated negative $6 million in revenue).\n"}

Just spend a few minutes concentrating on your breathing, and focus on the task at hand.\nThe advice is almost too simple to believe. But according to new research co-authored by Wharton management professor Sigal Barsade, if followed, it could save time and money for everyone \u2014 from a consumer searching for a new car all the way to the head of a billion-dollar corporation.\nBarsade, Andrew C. Hafenbrack and Zoe Kinias \u2014 both with the department of organizational behavior at INSEAD \u2014 are the authors of \u201cDebiasing the Mind through Meditation: Mindfulness and the Sunk-Cost Bias.\u201d The paper, published in Psychological Science, explores how short meditation sessions can reduce the likelihood that decisions will be made based on information from the past that should have no bearing on the choice at hand.\nSpecifically, the researchers wanted to examine the intersection of meditation and the elimination of the sunk-cost bias, or the tendency to continue a losing course of action once time and money have been invested. Think about the difficulty in getting someone to sell a stock that has plummeted in value, or to ignore bad advice one has paid for. More high-profile examples would include continuing a disastrous military campaign or an over-budget construction project.\nIn all of those cases, past behavior \u2014 specifically, having already invested significant time and money toward arriving at a particular outcome \u2014 is influencing an individual\u2019s ability to clearly assess the situation and make a decision that takes the current factors into account.\nMeditation has been shown to help people focus on the present and let go of both the past and future. Hafenbrack says intensive meditation training can often involve two to five classes a week for eight weeks, with the goal being to train participants in achieving a more meditative state even when they are not meditating, which will help them be less focused on the past and future.\nTo test the impact of short-term meditation on making decisions prone to influence by the sunk-cost bias, the researchers set up a series of experiments. After an online survey confirmed the relationship of mindfulness and the ability of participants to resist the sunk-cost bias, the researchers examined scenarios designed to show that meditation could bring about mindfulness.\nThe first pair of studies asked participants to choose one of two decision-making tasks. In one task, making an affirmative decision \u2013 in other words, the choice to do something \u2013 represented the resistance to the sunk-cost bias. In the other, a negative decision \u2013 or the choice to not do something \u2013 meant the individual had resisted the bias.\nA subsequent survey, this one done online, required participants to complete a 10-item decision-making inventory, again with about half hearing the guided meditation recording beforehand. The results of the earlier studies were replicated and show the value of a short time-out when someone is placed in the role of a decision maker.\nAlthough it only takes a few minutes of mindfulness to have an effect, if you\u2019ve already booked your tickets for a more intense meditation retreat out in the desert, don\u2019t change your plans yet.\nBarsade and Hafenbrack are continuing their meditation study by looking at its influence on the negotiation process. While they don\u2019t have direct results yet, they are continuing to uncover the ways that meditation can bring out positive emotional responses in situations that have traditionally been viewed as emotionless."}

With a weak job market, college graduates who were oversold by pricey for-profit colleges and stuck with college debt have become targets for scammers.\nOut of the 25,000 consumer complaints the attorney general\u2019s office received last year, 3,350 complaints were about overly aggressive collection agencies and scammers offering debt relief. Another 1,523 complaints were made against for-profit colleges and student loan hustles.\nMadigan\u2019s office also is investigating Navient Corp., the student loan servicing company formerly known as Sallie Mae, and last week filed a lawsuit against a Lombard company that claimed to help student loan relief assistance.\nMadigan said Navient staff tend to steer students struggling to make payments into \u201cdeferments\u201d of their payments, which allows students to put off making payments. But interest continues to pile up, and then is added into the principal of the loan once payments resume.

They\u2019ll be able to do what they love and make enormous sums doing it.\nEven so, one issue clouds their bright futures \u2014 and the future of the NFL: the potential for life-altering changes to their brains.\nEvidence has been mounting for more than a decade, in laboratories and in real-life tragedies, that successive exposure to head hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The most convincing science comes from researchers at Boston University School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, who have found CTE in 88 of 92 of the deceased former NFL players studied.\nHuman tragedies \u2014 the suicides of Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau in 2012 and former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson in 2011 \u2014\u2013 have driven home the devastation that CTE can cause. The symptoms, which include depression and memory loss, often mimic dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s but can strike men in their prime.\nResearchers confirmed that Seau, 43, and Duerson, 50, both had CTE.\nAfter fighting reality for years, the NFL has publicly admitted that football and CTE are \u201ccertainly\u201d linked, as NFL Senior Vice President Jeff Miller did last month in congressional testimony.\nTo its credit, even before that admission, the league has changed rules, added medical personnel and imposed fines and even some suspensions for violent plays that might have been shrugged off just a few years ago. Under the league\u2019s \u201cconcussion protocol,\u201d players are no longer rushed back into games prematurely. All good.\nBut the focus on concussions tends to obscure the bigger picture: This disease is not just about concussions. Cumulative, unspectacular \"subconcussive\" hits that some players suffer day in, day out are associated with CTE. According to a Frontline report last year, 40% of players testing positive for CTE were offensive or defensive linemen, the players most likely to suffer repetitive hits.\nCTE is not expected in people without a history of exposure to repetitive head trauma, and for now doctors can\u2019t say how prevalent it is in NFL players. But research, which has found CTE in men who have played only college football and even in a few high school players, suggests what common sense does: Getting hit in the head repeatedly, especially at a young age, is hazardous to your health.\nFootball itself is starting to see some real-life impact. A handful of younger players, including San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland, have retired early.\nConcussions, head impacts and CTE are now part of the nation's conversation. If the NFL wants to remain America's sport, it will need to fund even more research, including research that might come up with answers it doesn't like. It will need to penalize head shots even more harshly. It will have to see whether different equipment and tackling techniques can make the game safer. Ultimately, it will need to own up"}
{"idx": "7465", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we\u2019re talking about unions in the U.S. Need a primer? Catch up here.\nMichael Wasser is a senior policy analyst at Jobs With Justice.\nYou won\u2019t hear opponents admit it, but unions are popular and have been for a while. Last year Gallup found that 58 percent of Americans approved of unions. Since Gallup first asked people about their support for unions in 1936, approval dipped below 50 percent just once \u2014 when it dropped to 48 percent at the height of the Great Recession in 2009.\nAnti-union advocates prefer to focus on the long-term decline of union membership in the United States, which can suggest that unions are unnecessary or in an inevitable decline. It is true that union density has shrunk from its peak of 35.4 percent of the workforce in 1945 to 11.1 percent in 2015. But the erosion in union membership is not a natural, pre-ordained outcome \u2014 the reality is that intentional policy choices significantly contributed to fewer people becoming union members.\nBenign market forces alone do not explain the continual loss of union membership in the midst of broad support. Take the difference in union density in Canada and the United States: Union membership trends in these similar economies closely tracked each other until the late 1960s and early 1970s. If globalization alone were the main driver of declining union membership, we could expect the countries to have comparable unionization rates. Instead, Canada \u2014 which affords real protections for people coming together as a union \u2014 has more than twice the percentage of people in unions as the United States.\nOur country has allowed a broken and outdated labor law to remain in place for too long. Unlike other workplace laws, the National Labor Relations Act lacks meaningful financial penalties for employer wrongdoing, creating an economic incentive for employers to violate the law. Employers routinely influence union elections in their favor through intimidating and coercive tactics. In doing so, employers both regularly break the letter and spirit of the law, often aided by anti-union consultants and lawyers who are paid handsomely to provide advice on how to get away with manipulating the system. The fact is that current law does not offer working people a level playing field, advantaging chief executives set on denying their employees\u2019 right to organize and negotiate together.\nDespite the challenges, people continue to want to come together to have a say in their working lives. The last year saw a \u201cwave\u201d of digital newsroom staff joining in union. Nine thousand American Airlines passenger service agents won their union election in late 2014, doing so in the historically anti-union South. From 2000-2010, the National Labor Relations Board received nearly 3,000 requests for union elections from nursing home and non-acute care employees alone.\nAmericans are choosing to speak up together at work because they recognize that unions serve as a needed check and balance on corporate power. When working people can negotiate a fair return on their work, they earn higher wages and better benefits. The activism of individuals in unions has a ripple effect across communities. Non-union employees in similar industries and nearby locations generally see their working standards improve. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the decrease in unions has contributed to the increase in income inequality.\nPeople also know that joining together is the only effective rampart against the flood of money in a"}

During the research process, Chambers said, several respondents from the community there referred to the Twin Cities as a place where \u201cthings are better\u201d for Somali-Americans.\nSo Chambers decided to expand her research beyond political incorporation of Somalis in Columbus. The result was \u201cSomalis in the Twin Cities and Columbus,\u201d a 234-page book chronicling the political, economic and social integration of Somalis in the two cities \u2014 and comparing the difference between the two communities.\n\u201cI wanted to see if there were in fact differences,\u201d she said, \u201cand more importantly, wanted to come up with policy recommendations that policymakers could implement to increase incorporation of Somalis in the various communities\u201d throughout the country.\nIn 1991, after the civil war displaced millions of Somalis, many ended up in Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia and other states across the United States through the federal Refugee Resettlement Program.\nDespite their geographic location, Somalis in various cities and towns in the U.S. often remained in constant communication, exchanging information about places with good jobs, safe neighborhoods, reliable transportation and support service programs for refugee and immigrant families.\nAs Chambers writes, the Twin Cities eventually became the most desired destination for many new Somalis because of its \u201cpositive track with refugee resettlement,\u201d thanks to the service programs the state created when the Hmong community began to arrive in the 1970s.\nSomalis who lived in other places \u2014 including Virginia and San Diego, which boasted the largest Somali populations before the mid-1990s \u2014 began moving to the Twin Cities in search of employment, a lower cost of living and affordable rental housing options, the book notes.\nBy 1994, Chambers states in the book, Columbus had become another well-regarded destination for Somali-Americans.\nThough the majority of Somalis arrived in the U.S. about two decades ago, others had come in the \u201870s and \u201880s as students, military trainees and diplomats, who later extended their stay when political turmoil began to brew back in Somalia years before it erupted in chaos and anarchy in 1991.\nToday, most of those earliest arriving Somalis live in the Virginia area, New York, San Diego and other West and East Coast cities \u2014 and often hold professional jobs with international organizations, government agencies, public institutions and in the private sector.\nMost"}

The play of the Eagles defense.\nCHICAGO \u2014 The playoff performance of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback/folk hero/miracle worker Nick Foles has become almost mystical in nature, a phenomenon easier to marvel at than explain. He is a career backup who became a Super Bowl MVP, returned to holding clipboards and was again called in to save another season.\nFoles\u2019s logic-defying emergence has defined the Eagles\u2019 postseason excellence for two seasons, most recently with his game-winning touchdown pass on a fourth-and-two play in the final minute of Sunday\u2019s opening-round win over the Chicago Bears.\nHis story, though, should not be mistaken for the Eagles\u2019 driving force. There is nothing magical about Fletcher Cox, Michael Bennett and the rest of the Eagles\u2019 defensive front seven.\nWhile Foles justifiably hogs headlines, the primary reason to take the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl defense seriously resides on the other side of the ball. The Eagles\u2019 defense, stacked with stars and surging after a midseason, injury-riddled swoon, carries far less intrigue than Foles seizing fame as an understudy. But if the Eagles return to the Super Bowl, Philadelphia\u2019s defense will deserve a fair share of the credit.\nDuring last year\u2019s Super Bowl run, the Eagles surrendered 10 points to the Falcons and seven to the Vikings. They yielded 33 in the Super Bowl to the Patriots, but the defense also sealed the victory when defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady. Sunday against the Bears, they limited Chicago to 15 points and forced a three-and-out that set up Foles\u2019s game-winning drive. Foles has delivered magic, but Philadelphia\u2019s defense has been an equal partner.\nThe Eagles suffered a wave of injuries to their defense, particularly in the secondary, where they lost their top three cornerbacks (Ronald Darby, Jalen Mills and Sidney Jones) and safety Rodney McLeod. As they filled in with rookie Avonte Maddox and former practice squad player Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc at cornerback, and a carousel of reserves next to Jenkins at safety, the Eagles\u2019 defense wilted, bottoming out with a 48-7 beating at the hands of the New Orleans Saints, their next playoff opponent.\nThe Eagles\u2019 late-season defensive improvement does not owe to a return to health. While the return of defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan is significant, the Eagles will have pretty much the same personnel for this game against the Saints as the disastrous meeting in November. But the Eagles say they\u2019re better now, because those players forced into action have grown.\nThose cornerbacks could still be their downfall. Against the Bears, Mitchell Trubisky completed 18 of the 28 passes on which he targeted wide receivers for 248 yards, including five completions of at least 20 yards. On Chicago\u2019s fourth-quarter, go-ahead touchdown drive, Maddox yielded consecutive gains of 34 and 22 yards, the latter a touchdown on which he also committed pass interference.\nIf Trubisky can capitalize on Philadelphia\u2019s corners outdoors at Soldier Field, Drew Brees could vaporize them inside the Superdome. But Pederson insists the Eagles can handle the Saints now.\nTo beat the Saints, the Eagles will have to rely on their strength. Even"}

Thankfully, that\u2019s all going to change.\nOn Thursday, the City of Prince Albert officially unveiled the restored and reconfigured outdoor court facilities at the Midtown Community Club. The $170,000 refit means the area will have two fully resurfaced tennis courts, a basketball court, and last but not least, two pickleball courts.\nThe upgrades mean there are now three outdoor tennis venues in the city, two of which are public. The refurbished Midtown courts help make up for the loss of the old tennis facilities, which were torn down to make way for a new gym for Carlton Comprehensive Public High School.\nMayor Greg Dionne said the loss of those old courts left a gaping hole in the city\u2019s recreation life.

The item faced some opposition in city council after a report showed just how far conditions at the midtown court had deteriorated, and how expensive it would be to refurbish. The court\u2019s deteriorated asphalt base needed a complete restoration, and there were other common maintenance expenses involved in switching over from three non-regulation sized tennis courts to the current configuration.\nWard 7 Coun.

Big Papi has tormented the Yankees over the years, pounding 52 homers against them (51 as a member of the Sox), and taking forever to round the bases after each one.\nYes, there are some who speculate whether Ortiz did PEDs and won't like the idea of Ortiz being honored on the Stadium field because of that. There were examples of that sort of talk on social media Thursday after the Yanks announced the Sept. 29 shindig.\nPlease. Those folks who are upset must have forgotten that Andy Pettitte's No. 46 is forever retired. Didn't Alex Rodriguez get plenty of ovations in the Bronx?\nGive one to Ortiz, too.

Pinstriped blood courses through your veins. You worship the Core Four and your fervent wishes every day are a Yankee victory followed by a Sox loss.\nYou can't stand the idea of a party for someone wearing that uniform. We get it.\nThe Red Sox hit two extremes when they honored Rivera and Jeter on Landsdowne Street and, in so doing, failed to hit either over the Green Monster, if you will.\nThey got too cute with the Rivera party, what with all those 2004 comeback references - ha, ha! - and that colored the whole thing, even as they made a nice donation to help him build a school in Panama and gave him some other cool gifts. Jeez, was it a roast or a celebration?\nRivera, consummate gentleman, laughed off the reminders, but they went on too long and felt awkward.\nThe next year, when Jeter was leaving, they lavished too much praise on the Yankee captain.

Fenway's manual scoreboard in the Mawn-stah displayed the message: \"WITH RESPECT 2 DEREK JETER.\"\nIt felt excessive. Maybe they were trying to make up for the Rivera ceremony.

Try telling that to Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU).\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is reportedly working on a free ad-supported streaming video service that sounds an awful lot like The Roku Channel. Roku introduced The Roku Channel in September, and it's quickly grown to become a top five channel on Roku devices as well as a key piece of Roku's strategy moving forward.\nRumor has it Amazon's service, tentatively called Free Dive, will license older films and TV series. It will also be exclusive to Fire TV device users, just as The Roku Channel was originally exclusive to Roku device owners.\nAmazon has all of the tools necessary to stop The Roku Channel's momentum dead in its tracks.\nWhile Roku was one of the first to create streaming devices, Amazon's Fire TV devices have actually become just as popular for streaming video. Twenty-seven percent of streamers regularly use a Roku device to stream video, while 29% use a Fire TV device, according to a recent survey from William Blair analysts.\nIn fact, Amazon and Roku are two of the only device makers winning share in streaming time, growing at nearly the same rate. Roku's momentum is largely being driven by its efforts in licensing its operating system to television manufacturers. It expects the majority of new users to come from licensed sources going forward.\nAmazon's momentum is driven by its growing Prime ecosystem. Amazon continues to drive customers to Prime by expanding Prime-eligible items, adding more cities to Prime Now, integrating benefits with Whole Foods, and expanding its content library for Prime Instant Video. It often sells its Fire TV devices below cost as a way to encourage more viewership for the premium video service it bundles with Prime. Amazon has found that members who watch video regularly are more likely to renew their membership.\nBoth companies have a lot of momentum with their audiences, but if anyone can take on Roku, it's Amazon.\nAmazon's burgeoning advertising business is one of its biggest profit drivers. It could even become its most profitable business within a few years. Amazon's advertising growth has largely been fueled by search ads, as Amazon dominates online product searches. But Amazon's shopper data gives it a wealth of valuable data for targeting video ads.\nWhile Roku has made significant progress in developing its ad technology and collecting user data, it can't compete with Amazon's data. Amazon also has some experience with video advertising during Thursday Night Football and other live sports events it broadcasts on Prime Video as well as advertisements on Twitch. Amazon recently doubled down on video ads on Twitch by removing ad-free viewing for Prime members.\nWith a strong advertising business, Amazon's ability to monetize ad-supported watch time is greatly enhanced. Therefore, it could afford to spend more on content and still make the same amount of profit as Roku. Not to mention, Amazon has deep pockets to seed its content library.\nMoreover, Amazon's advertising capabilities could attract a lot of content partners. A key part of Roku's strategy with The Roku Channel is to help content owners reach a wider audience and share ad revenue with those content owners. So, some of the content isn't directly licensed by Roku, but part of a revenue-sharing agreement. Amazon could offer potentially greater reach and greater returns to content owners for putting their content on Free Dive.\nAmazon certainly has the tools to take what Roku did and make it better.

{"idx": "7489", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A bounty of organic produce at the Alameda Natural Grocery.\nIn the year since I have been writing this column, readers have sent in many questions about organic foods. With the White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture planting organic gardens, these questions have become more urgent.\nQ:What is the difference between \"100% organic\" and \"organic\"?\nA: Organic has a precise meaning under the USDA's organic program. Certified 100% Organic means that all the ingredients in a product have been grown or raised according to the USDA's organic standards, which are the rules for producing foods labeled organic. Certified Organic requires that 95 to 99 percent of the ingredients follow the rules.\n-- Plants cannot be grown with synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, genetic modification, irradiation or sewage sludge.\n-- Animals must be raised exclusively on organic feed, have access to the outdoors, and cannot be given antimicrobial drugs or hormones.\n-- Producers will be inspected to make sure these practices are being followed to the letter.\nQ:How do we know \"organic\" truly reflects our beliefs?\nA: I am guessing this question refers to the spirit of organics. In the 1920s, the British botanist Albert Howard learned from observing farmers in India that human health depends on growing foods sustainably. Indian farmers taught him the importance of protecting soil nutrients through composted manure, crop rotation and appropriate cultivation, and using biological pest controls. Later, these methods were called \"organic.\"\nBut USDA organic rules do not say a word about sustainability. This gap occurred as a result of the history of the organic standards (as I recount in \"What to Eat\"), but also as a result of the USDA's inherent conflicts of interest. The USDA's main job is to promote industrial agriculture. Organics, the USDA says, are just different, not better. Alas, the USDA has not always been a loving home for the organic program.\nQ:Do food companies use the word \"organic\" in the same way they use \"health\"?\nA: USDA organic rules are about the letter of the law, not its spirit. Food marketers, however, take advantage of public perceptions that \"organic\" implies spirit - sustainability and better nutrition. Companies that follow the rules can legitimately market highly processed foods as organic, taking advantage of their health aura to command higher prices.\nNo wonder so many big food companies have bought organic product lines (see links.sfgate.com/ZHKJ).Yes, organic junk food is free of synthetic pesticides, but the foods still have calories. As I like to put it, an organic junk food is still a junk food.\nQ:Which is worse: eating nonorganic produce full of pesticides or not eating produce at all?\nA: Research demonstrates substantial health benefits from eating fruits and vegetables. Although I wish we had more definitive research, these benefits appear to greatly outweigh any risks of pesticides.\nIf you want to compromise, you can save your organic dollars for the foods most likely to be high in pesticides. These, according to the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org), are peaches, nectarines, apples, bell peppers, strawberries, cherries, pears, raspberries, imported grapes, celery, potatoes and spinach.\nIn contrast, foods that you peel - onions, peas, bananas, sweet corn and tropical fruits, for"}
{"idx": "7490", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years.\nDespite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today?\nA new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago. This finding enhances our knowledge about the history of human tool use, suggesting that sophisticated cognitive abilities were present relatively early in human history. It also raises the possibility that tools may have given early humans an advantage as they ventured out of Africa.\nThe ancient tools, called microliths, were found at a site called Pinnacle Point in South Africa. Microliths are small stone tools\u2014less than 50mm in length\u2014that are heat-treated and trimmed into specific shapes. The \u201cbladelets\u201d found at Pinnacle Point closely resemble tools from other sites that were used as the points of arrows and other compound projectile weapons. However, optical dating techniques suggest the Pinnacle Point tools are 6,000 to 10,000 years older than those found at other sites. So humans may have created and used bows and arrows earlier than previously thought.\nNot only is this finding interesting in terms of weaponry, but the complex process required to make microliths suggests these early humans had surprisingly modern cognitive abilities. Early humans would have needed to identify and collect the mineral needed for the blade and the wood needed for the heat source, prepare the blades, create and maintain the controlled fire to heat-treat them, reshape the heated blades into microliths, carve wood or bone into shafts, and mount the microlith on the shaft to form a compound tool. Furthermore, the researchers believe microlithic technology persisted at Pinnacle Point for at least 11,000 years, indicating that this intricate process must have been passed down across multiple generations. Following\u2014and passing along\u2014this \u201crecipe\u201d implies microlith-makers living more than 70,000 years ago were capable of foresight, prioritization of tasks, and cultural transmission. All of those are certainly sophisticated cognitive capabilities.\nOther studies have used symbolic representation, such as body ornaments and carved decorations, as a proxy for the modern human mind. These types of objects generally appear in the archaeological record between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago. However, critics have argued the thoughts motivating the creation and use of these objects is unclear, and therefore they are not a good proxy for advanced cognition. The authors of the Nature study disagree, saying that complex ideas and transmission are a better way to measure what makes a human mind \u201cmodern.\u201d Interestingly, the age of the Pinnacle Point microliths\u201471,000 years\u2014falls squarely in the range of when scientists believe symbolic representation first appeared on the scene.\nThe researchers assert the skill associated with making microliths would have been hugely beneficial to early humans. Projectile weapons such as bows and arrows would allow them to kill with greater accuracy and from longer distances. Microlithic technology may have given early modern humans an advantage over both prey and Neanderthals, assisting their migration from Africa and perhaps enabling their eventual spread across the globe.\nNature, 2012.

So, if 40 million people were to vote on Sunday, the value of one House seat would be 80,000 votes.\nA party cannot win more seats than it has \"earned\" in total votes nationwide. And if a party has already reached or is close to its cap in constituency seats, then it cannot get any more party seats than that cap allows.\nTo illustrate the impact of the new rules, Pheu Thai won the last election, in 2011, with 204 constituency seats and then 61 party seats - awarded under a directly proportional system - as it won 48 per cent of the total vote. That gave it a majority of 265 seats in the House of Representatives.\nThat's a huge advantage, though not a guarantee.\nIf no coalition can agree on prime minister, the new constitution also allows for an \"outside\" prime minister who is not a member of parliament."}

Lawmakers say it would generate lots of tax money to use in the state's healthcare and educational systems.\n\"Colorado has been a success. The tax revenue is putting money into the schools, the health care system,\" said Greg Cox of Lancaster. \"If the budget is tight these days, why not make it legal to get the tax revenue?\"\n\"Yeah, I'm for it. I'm for legalizing it. I am. I don't have a problem with it. I grew up when it was popular. You know? I'm 62 now,\" said Tina German of Edwardsville.\nRight now, medicinal marijuana is legal in Pennsylvania. You must have a prescription, and you must get marijuana products at a licensed dispensary.\nIf recreational pot is given the green light, people could grow up to six plants of their own.\nIn addition, the Senate bill calls for those convicted of possession or delivery of less than an ounce of marijuana to have their records expunged.\nAndy Bazelle has a home in Massachusetts where recreational marijuana use is legal.\n\"I think it's being used, and I think legalizing it will make it more regulated, and I think if it's taxed that's a good thing.\"\nState lawmakers who support recreational marijuana say taxing it would generate about $600 million a year for all kinds of programs from health care to education and more.\n\"As long as it's regulated properly. I think the funds should be taxed heavily. I think the funds that are generated from that could actually help with things like roads and schooling. It should all go to schools. I mean they're constantly cutting education, and we're going to end up raising a bunch of dumb kids,\" said Jarrod Williams of Edwardsville.\nRight now, there are 10 states in the nation plus the District of Columbia that have legalized marijuana. Supporters of this bill say they believe Pennsylvania could soon be added to that list.\nLt. Gov. John Fetterman is touring the state listening to what people have to say about a plan like this.\nHe said, \"From the standpoint of people being incarcerated for small amounts of marijuana in the past and it's ruined a lot of lives.

After some shells crossed the boundary, South Korea responded and the two sides fired hundreds of artillery rounds into each other\u2019s territorial waters.\nThe exchange of fire came the day after North Korea sounded an ominous warning that it might carry out a \u201cnew\u201d type of nuclear test \u2014 a possible reference to testing a uranium-based device or a miniaturised warhead small enough to fit on a ballistic missile.\nAlthough South Korean intelligence reports say there are no signs of an imminent test, analysts note that the North is treading a familiar path that has previously ended in an underground bunker.\n\u201cThe most disturbing possibility is that recent steps might conform with a pattern: missile test, UN condemnation, nuclear threat, nuclear test,\u201d said Stephan Haggard, professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego.\nThe UN Security Council condemned the North\u2019s mid-range missile launches \u2014 a violation of UN resolutions prohibiting North Korean ballistic missile tests \u2014 and said it would consider \u201cappropriate\u201d action.\nThat could include asking the council\u2019s North Korean Sanctions Committee to consider expanding its list of designated individuals and entities.\n\u201cThat step would provide an excuse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c- if one were needed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c- for a fourth nuclear test,\u201d Haggard wrote in a regular blog post.\nNorth Korea has conducted three"}

You can pretty much guess what happens: Clouseau says inappropriate things, Clouseau breaks stuff, Clouseau winds up being smarter than anyone else in the movie. While the vintage Panther movies were never known for their unpredictability, at least Peter Sellers was always delivering the laughs.

At least they all got a trip to France out of this.\nAnd if for no other reason than to guarantee a boffo opening weekend in India, lovely Bollywood icon Aishwarya Rai Bachchan comes along for the ride playing an expert on The Tornado, even though the film gives her nothing funny to say or interesting to do.\nOnce I was watching The Office on DVD, and spent 10 minutes watching deleted scenes before I realised it wasn't the actual episode.\nThe Pink Panther 2 is pretty much the same experience, making you wonder if there's a cut of the film that doesn't linger so needlessly on Clouseau's love triangle, or leaves out the scenes (Clouseau karate fights with tweens?) that have nothing to do with the plot.\nBut apparently Martin and Zwart really did want to make a movie this aimless and derivative, aware that their target audience of children won't know what they're missing. Would that the rest of us could be so lucky.\nNo mention is made of her in the review.\nSteve Martin's second outing as Inspector Clouseau is a hit-and-miss family entertainment, which relies heavily on the audience's affection for the bumbling policeman to make up for a paper-thin storyline and a drab visual palette.

And experts predict its prevalence will only continue to grow, eventually accounting for more than 23.6 million deaths per year by 2030.\nBut research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that nearly one-fourth of cardiovascular disease-related deaths are preventable, and regular exercise plays an important role in reducing one\u2019s risk.\nIn honor of American Heart Month, running coaches Julie Sapper and Lisa Reichmann are sharing some advice on how to get moving and ways to stay motivated. After all, a few miles a few times a week can go a long way when it comes to heart health.\nOne great thing about running is that it requires minimal equipment to get started. Reichmann said a good pair of running shoes is really all you need \u2014 just make sure they\u2019re a good fit. Visit a specialty running store to ensure you get the right shoe for your gait, and expect to invest about $100 in a pair.\nSapper said this time of year, moisture-wicking layers are also helpful on cold-weather runs. These days you can find great options at any retailer that sells athletic gear.\nEven if your overall goal is to run, expect walking to be a big part of the workout until you build your endurance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important, also, to start with run-walk intervals. You don\u2019t want to go out and try to run two, three, four miles straight if you are just starting or if you haven\u2019t run in a while,\u201d Reichmann said.\nBoth Sapper and Reichmann recommend the Couch to 5K running app as a useful tool for new runners.\nThere\u2019s no need to sprint through the streets when you run. Sapper and Reichmann said the best pace is a \u201cconversational\u201d one, or a pace at which you can carry on a conversation with someone next to you.\n\u201cThat is where we build our aerobic endurance \u2026 We can also run farther and a longer duration when we run at a conversational pace,\u201d Reichmann said.\nYes, you will have bad runs, and true, you may never race at your high school pace again, but don\u2019t get discouraged: \u201cProgress is linear,\u201d Sapper said, and it doesn\u2019t happen over night.\n\u201cWe like to tell our runners to find your reason why,\u201d Reichmann added.\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle is the biggest key to reducing one\u2019s risk for chronic health conditions, and making exercise a part of your regular routine is part of the equation.\nSapper and Reichmann said finding a running partner or a running coach can help you hold yourself accountable and stay motivated. Signing up for seasonal races is another way to make sure you stay on top of training, and there are a number of options available in the D.C. area.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to have fun and focus on the positives.\n\u201cEnjoy the sunshine, enjoy some rare moments of vitamin D in the winter, find a new route, explore a new area,\u201d Sapper said."}

SAC bid.\nTrackTown USA/USATF president Vin Lananna did not take part in the deliberations and recused himself from voting. TrackTown USA is the Eugene local organizing committee for major track meets.\nUSATF board member Lauren Fleshman, a Bend resident and former professional distance runner, said the decision should not be interpreted as a vote against Eugene or TrackTown USA.\n\"They were extremely professional, and they want to host as many things as possible,\" Fleshman said. \"But long term, you can't build track on one city. I'm very comfortable with Eugene being the epicenter of the sport. Their work continues to be critically important.\n\"But it's hard to argue against the idea there needs be more than one capable city.\"\nMt. SAC has some advantages. It is part a large metropolitan area and served by an international airport. It is more accessible to more of the country than Eugene, and provides more housing and transportation options for fans from outside the area.\nMt.

Jordan wonders if it would have been better for Mt. SAC to hold a USATF championships meet before taking on the trials.\n\"Mt. SAC is the new kid on the block in the sense of having a new facility and having people energized about putting this on,\" said Jordan, who is not formally connected to TrackTown USA. \"Their challenge is turn that energy into putting on a well-organized event.\"\nThat challenge has been met in Eugene, where the community rallied around the last three Olympic Trials.\nEugene has been awarded the 2021 World Outdoor Championships.

Upgrades to acoustics and energy efficiency, a building addition, more restrooms, a kitchen and other amenities would raise that total.\nA full cost estimate will be completed in mid-November, Clavelle added.\nThe vote in March to rehabilitate Memorial, if City Council votes to place it on the ballot, would come on the heels of high-price ballot items in November: $70 million for improvements to Burlington High School, and $30 million for upgrades to the city\u2019s wastewater systems.\nTo pass, the measure would require a two-thirds margin of votes.\nFor decades, Memorial served as a prime downtown venue for big-name musicians and athletes, community theatre, youth concerts, art classes, farmers markets and college commencements.\nDeferred maintenance has taken a toll on the building since the 1990s, and the city closed it for safety reasons in December 2016.\nAll three scenarios for Memorial\u2019s rehabilitation show little change to the auditorium itself, beyond the addition of retractable bleacher seating.\nBut a two-story addition to the building on its north side would allow for a badly needed loading dock, more room for heating and cooling machinery, a spacious community room and maybe even a roof terrace, said CEDO's Clavelle."}

But one of the bigger guilt issues weighing us down: The stress of feeling like we aren\u2019t saving enough for college.\nIndeed, 44% of parents say they feel guilty about not having saved enough for their kid\u2019s college, according to a survey of 1,000 moms and dads from Student Loan Hero.\nAnd, frankly, they haven\u2019t saved enough: Only 57% of parents are saving anything for college -- and of those that do, the average amount is just $16,380. With the costs of four years of some colleges projected to hit well into the six figures in the years to come, even if that money is well-invested, many parents likely won\u2019t be able to afford the entire sticker price of school. With those sky high costs, \u201cit\u2019s almost becoming unrealistic for many parents to think they even can pay for the entire cost of college,\u201d says Erin Voisin, the director of financial planning for EP Wealth Advisors, who notes that college costs often rise at about 5% a year.\nAnd that\u2019s OK. \u201cFor the vast majority of Americans who don\u2019t have the considerable resources to enable them to do it all, some sort of tradeoff is probably inevitable,\u201d says Kimberly Foss, the founder and president of Empyrion Wealth Management. And often the smart trade off is focusing more on saving for more important goals like your own retirement, and on paying for necessities like rent/mortgage, food and other necessities, explains Angela Coleman, an investment advisor at Unified Trust Company.\nThe reason: \u201cYour kids can finance college, but you can\u2019t finance retirement,\u201d explains Voisin, who points out that not only can your kids get loans for college, they can also get scholarships or earn money while at school with a job or work study -- all things that as a retiree are more difficult for you to do. Plus, one of the biggest favors you can do for your kids is to provide for your own retirement lifestyle and care, allowing the next generation to find its own way without the added burden of providing for parents with too few resources,\u201d says Foss.\nAnother option: Have your children spend a year or two a community college, which is typically significantly cheaper, and then transfer into a higher-rated school; on a resume, you typically just list where your degree is from anyway.\nThere\u2019s also value in kid\u2019s helping out with college costs, says Coleman. \u201cIt is OK to allow our children to invest in their own futures,\u201d she says. But kids who help with the costs may have \u201ca vested interest in what is happening.\u201d Of course, before they take on a student loan burden, kids need to understand what the loans will mean to their lives (what might monthly payments be, how hard will those be to manage, etc.). \u201cHave that talk with your kids,\u201d Voisin."}

The friends you meet, the insects you eat and the breathtaking scenery you visit can make spending a year or a semester abroad one of the most valuable experiences of your undergraduate career.\nMy year in China with the China Educational Travel program had all of this and more, including double-deep fried pork and being on a televised dating show. I left home simply looking to improve my ability to speak Chinese but my host culture sent me back with a slew of new experiences and a new awareness of my fellow human beings.\nWe rarely consider others until we try on their shoes and what better way to gain empathy for a whole new way of life than by living in another country?\nLiving without potable tap water or the obligation to tip can make you appreciate your home and host cultures all the more. While I lost out on water fountains, I found hot water dispensers throughout the halls in China, making refilling my thermos of tea a snap and providing a much needed stream of caffeine.\nHowever, I gleaned the most education from learning a new way of speaking and studying Chinese, which completely changed how I thought about other people back home and abroad.\nSlowly but surely, I found myself developing a new personality when I spoke Chinese. I was more confident, more boisterous and spent many a night cracking jokes with my host roommate in front of China\u2019s version of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d I found myself talking and behaving more like my roommate Wan Jing, and I felt like I could truly understand his background in southern China.\nMy new and improved Chinese also opened the door to provincial television.

Fortunately, my skills were up to the challenge and I sang, danced and talked my way to the final round before being eliminated in the dating show due to my lack of a car, house or job.\nChatting with my fellow contestants backstage, however, gave me pause. Many of them had really come seeking a spouse, which seemed like a lofty goal for spending 15 minutes onstage with 12 women.\nHow could you possibly hope to get to know them well?

Fortunately, I can easily put myself back into their shoes given our shared experiences. I remain eternally grateful to Wan Jing and my fellow dating show contestants for further educating me about Chinese culture. Their lessons stay with me, helping me imagine myself in the place of people I may never get the chance to meet or be.\nEvery day now I try to put myself into someone else\u2019s shoes, be it my stressed professor, the student pushing past me on the way to class or the"}

It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.\nOn Aug. 23, 1966 - 50 years ago today - Lunar Orbiter 1 took the above photo: the first-ever of Earth rising up above the cold, bright dust of our planet's biggest satellite.\nHowever iconic, it looks pretty crummy.\nThat's because 1960s technology couldn't access the full depth of the data NASA had on its tapes.

With the threat of tariffs on the auto industry being very real, and automotive manufacturing in Ontario having been in a state of decline for some time, it\u2019s time for Ontario to shift resources and focus toward aerospace manufacturing.\nHistorically, Ontario has made a significant effort to protect and enhance automotive and auto parts manufacturing and related jobs over other sectors. While automotive will remain an important part of the province\u2019s and country\u2019s economy, Canada and Ontario have a significant opportunity to shift their focus to further bolster their position in aerospace-related manufacturing over the next 10 years.\nA report by the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada (AIAC) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), states the industry contributed nearly $28-billion to the country\u2019s GDP and 208,000 jobs to the Canadian economy in 2016. As the aerospace sector continues to expand, both in terms of size and employment, we would be wise to transition resources and incentives toward aerospace production.\nComparably, automotive employs approximately 130,000 and contributes $20-billion to the economy; however, employment has been trending down since the early 2000s. This is partly due to not having car manufacturers with global headquarters in Canada, lower costs of automation, as well as companies transitioning automotive-related jobs to lower-cost countries. As automotive manufacturers across North America look for cost reductions, the higher volumes in the automotive industry make it more practical to move automotive-related jobs to lower-cost manufacturing locations such as Mexico and China. A significant portion of the North American automotive assembly operations are moving to the southern United States and Mexico, making it more difficult for Canadian parts suppliers. Conversely, military restrictions prevent moving aerospace work to low-cost countries and the smaller volumes make automation less attractive. Also, transportation costs for aerospace parts are not nearly as sensitive as compared with automotive parts. If you add in the fact that the United States enjoys a significant global trade surplus in aerospace, protectionism is the last thing they would want in that industry.\nThe complexity and technical requirements in the aerospace industry require companies to hire many skilled workers. Heavily dependent on engineers and other technical staff, aerospace puts a premium on engineering and quality, which makes it easier for Canada and Ontario, with a highly skilled work force, to compete.\nThese advantages have resulted in aerospace being the largest manufacturing employer in California. According to management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, aerospace accounts for more than 200,000 direct and 500,000 indirect jobs in California, with a direct and indirect economic impact of more than US$100-billion. Aerospace wages in California are in the top 3 per cent and revenue is equivalent to the film industry and agriculture industry combined.\nInternationally, commercial airplane deliveries have grown from 850 planes in 2008 to a projected 1,577 in 2018 and further growth to 1,850 planes by 2020, at a value in excess of US$1.5-trillion."}

The first product, Zendesk Suite, will reportedly bring chat, email, and other customer support channels under one unifying platform. The second product, Zendesk Connect, is designed to gather customer interaction data and use that information to proactively solve customer service problems. Both products are available starting today.\nPerhaps the best way to describe the Zendesk Suite is that it's a unified umbrella that integrates email, live chat, phone, self-service, and virtually any other channel you might use for user or customer service interaction, such as social media. It essentially combines the Zendesk Chat, Zendesk Guide, Zendesk Talk, and Zendesk Support products into one platform. According to Astha Malik, Vice President of Platform and Product Marketing at Zendesk, Zendesk Suite is designed to let companies connect to customers through whatever channel they want.\n\"I think a lot of companies are trying to come up with creative ways to make serving customers easier, and we've found that being able to speak to customers in the way that they prefer is really the best way to do this,\" said Malik. However, Malik is quick to admit that providing customers with their choice of preferred channels isn't new.\n\"What's new here,\" Malik continues, \"is that we have now integrated all of these channels together in one package. We think this will make life a lot simpler for agents, managers, and end users alike. We want our customers to feel more empowered and more productive. That is the driving force behind why we're launching Zendesk Suite.\"\nSimilar to the company's other offerings, there are a number of different pricing options available. Zendesk Suite's Pro version begins at $89 per user per month (paid annually) or $109 per user per month without a yearly commitment. It offers omnichannel support as well as reporting and analytical features. The Enterprise version begins at $149 per user per month (paid annually) or $179 per user (paid month to month). For the extra cost, you will get the ability to assign roles and permissions to staff, 24/7 support, and multi-brand support, among other things.\nWe've seen other companies announce products with unification in mind. Earlier this spring, RingCentral announced a similar product in the form of its Collaborative Contact Center, which boasts an array of tools that come in one app designed to help teams solve customer problems easier. Twilio also made a play for the space with its announcement of Flex, a highly customizable customer service platform that lets customers include all sorts of different channels into just one app.\nSo it's clear that companies looking for a unified customer service platform have no shortage of options these days. But Zendesk has the advantage of being a leader in the helpdesk market, so it will be interesting to see exactly how much it can leverage that position with Zendesk Suite.\nThe company calls Zendesk Connect its \"proactive engagement solution.\" At its core, Zendesk Connect, which will begin at $180 per month for 2,000 monthly messaged users, blends analytics and automation. The tool uses machine learning (ML) models to anticipate customer problems before they happen.

Add to that the specific national attitude towards charity in general and you'll see that charity is not a clear-cut matter. This makes the process of sharing ideas, models and technologies in charity, emerged and being developed in modern Russia since market economy rise, especially interesting.\nConcept of charity as one of the spheres of corporate practice is developing along with the business itself. Each company understands the meaning of charity and corporate social responsibility and sponsorship in its specific way.\nHere is our understanding. By social responsibility we mean an irreproachable attitude towards business, consumer, society and employees. We see it as our obligation to develop our business, to be a responsible taxpayer, to provide adequate working conditions and development opportunities for our employees. We understand our social responsibility as immaculate compliance with product quality standards, providing correct product information to the consumers, responsible use of resources and respectful attitude towards values of the country we work in.\nWe see charity as looking for, outlining and implementing programs aimed at those who are in need. We have five giving areas where we implement our charitable projects globally \u2013 extreme hunger and poverty, education development, environmental sustainability and living conditions in rural areas, and domestic violence and disaster relief. Our charitable projects all over the world reflect our corporate philosophy: We respect the society we work in and share its concerns, and participate in meeting acute societal challenges as much as we can.\nI frequently hear a question -- \"Does business need charity programs at all?\" The answer is simple: It can't live without them. Responsible companies always accept their responsibility not only for production standards, but for the society as a whole, for its wellbeing and development.\nAny business is naturally interested in predictable and long lasting future. One can make that happen only through everyday construction of corporate future as a part of societal. That's how we come to a simple truth -- corporate citizenship is in fact a strategy of building up stable and constructive interaction with society through understanding its needs and formation of mutually beneficial dialogue resulting in positive societal development.\nWe develop all our projects must be actual, targeted and serve as a model. As a rule, our finds are directed to non-commercial local organizations professionally and permanently working in the areas matching our donation directions. That does not however mean that having transferred the money to some foundation we consider our mission completed. We always have clear understanding of how many people will get our help, what will it consist of and how that will change their lives for the better.\nGeographically, our charity projects in Russia cover almost all the country. Many projects are being implemented in Leningrad and Krasnodar regions, where our factories operate. And our focus on employee involvement is not the only reason for this. For example, since 2001 one of our factories together with Leningrad regional fund of social support is carrying out charity program for WWII veterans living in the Lomonosovskiy district of Leningrad region. This project is supported by the factory employees and their family members and is perceived very passionately by everyone.\nSimilar projects are being implemented in Krasnodar known for careful attitude to the elderly. One of our most impressive projects is our cooperation with Krasnodar regional fund of social protection. Last year we donated 10,000,000 rubles for purchasing individual equipment for elderly and disabled people who temporary or permanently reside in centers of social rehabilitation.

Logan told the Associated Press that it appeared most of the deaths were a result of stabbing or slashing. Some victims may have been beaten to death, he said. Autopsies will be conducted to confirm how each man was killed.\n\u201cHow else are you going to die in prison? They don\u2019t have guns,\u201d Logan said.\nThree weeks ago at the prison, which opened 25 years ago, inmates overpowered a guard, held him hostage and took control of part of a dorm for about 90 minutes.

When she wakes up the next day, she has to start over from scratch. Sandler meets Barrymore and falls for her and hilarity ensues.\nThe only question is whether Congressional Republicans think that the public has fallen prey to Barrymore\u2019s ailment or are they unknowing sufferers?\nAs Republicans posture en masse claiming that they are going to use the power of the purse to rein in Obama one month after giving him a virtual blank check for most of the remainder of his time in office through the omnibus spending bill, they either think the collective memory is so dim or the eggnog so thick that few will remember their recent catastrophic failure.\nWhat is worse however, is that while they are talking about President Obama enforcing the laws against criminal misuse of firearms that are on the books, Congressional Republicans are moving forward with plans to pass legislation reducing sentencing guidelines for those caught possessing a gun while committing a drug offense.\nThat\u2019s right. At a time when Baltimore broke its annual homicide record and Chicago has returned to the days of Capone with eleven murders in the first week of the new year, a bi-partisan supported criminal justice reform measure would put a Republican rubber stamp on the release of thousands of major drug dealers back onto the streets from which they were forcibly removed.\nOn top of this Republican proposed release program, President Obama is drastically increasing Justice Department staff to handle the expected massive increase in pardons and clemency that the President is expected to issue beyond the 40,000 plus convicts he began releasing starting in Oct. 2015.\nAnd into this mix, Congress is trying to pass legislation, which the President will sign, that retroactively cuts mandatory sentences of those still serving time in the federal penitentiary.\nThis might make sense if federal prisons were overrun with people who were caught up, arrested and convicted of simple possession of drugs charges. But that is not the case, in fact, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission as of the end of 2014, only 15 U.S. citizens were serving in federal prison for \u201csimple possession,\u201d and most were likely plead down from more serious charges.\nThe federal mandatory minimums are reserved for high-level traffickers. To earn a 10-year mandatory minimum, a person must possess at least one kilogram of heroin, the equivalent of 10,000 individual fixes and countless lives destroyed. Possession of five kilos of cocaine will get you the same 10-year mandatory minimum with a street value of almost $150,000. If you possess a ton of marijuana, you are 204 pounds short of what is needed to qualify for the 10-year mandatory.\nPeople in federal prison under the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for drug possession are not the kid in high school who sells his buddy a joint. Republicans would be releasing, on a bi-partisan basis as if that absolves them of culpability, the kingpin who is running a distribution network that is claiming the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people who fall into the snare of drug addiction.\nAny"}

Earlier this year, the longstanding member of Fleetwood Mac was fired from the band he helped to rise to cultural and artistic prominence, and while Buckingham hasn't spoken out much about the job termination, his newfound solo tour suggests he might be looking to stick it to the band for leaving him behind. Indeed, Buckingham announced that he is going on tour this fall, and he'll begin his own tour just a mere four days after Fleetwood Mac begins its own fall tour in early October. That means Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac are going to be on the road at the same time, but in completely separate venues.\nThe upcoming solo tour was announced earlier this week, and the tour dates include venues in Portland, Oregon (where the tour will begin on October 7th); San Francisco, California; Los Angeles, California; San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois; Washington, DC; Charlotte, North Carolina; Miami, Florida; and a few more locations. The solo tour will call it quits at the beginning of December in Pennsylvania. Tickets have already gone on sale for the big Lindsey Buckingham tour.\nLindsey Buckingham's anticipated tour doesn't seem to be quite as extensive as the one Fleetwood Mac will depart on in Buckingham's absence, but it is fairly ironic that Lindsey Buckingham is going on tour at all, considering how there were rumors (or, perhaps, Rumours) among the worried fans that the terminated musician was axed from the group because he didn't want to go on tour later this year, hoping to make another album instead. If that is the reason for his termination (and, again, that is only a rumor and not confirmed at all), then this tour is a bit of a slap in the face. If those rumors aren't true, then this tour could simply be in promotion of Solo Anthology: The Best of Lindsey Buckingham, out on October 5. Perhaps there's a little bit of both coming into play.\nAs for the new album, in addition to announcing the upcoming solo tour, Lindsay Buckingham also unveiled a three-disc compilation of his solo material, which he plans to release in anticipation of his own forthcoming tour.\nWhenLindsey Buckingham was asked about his recent dismal from the iconic band earlier this year during a political rally for environmental attorney Mike Levin's bid for California's Congressional District, the guitarist expressed his disappointment in the decision but didn't have discouraging words to say about the remaining members who made the call. Either his opinion changed or he's simply trying to prove to the band that he can draw a crowd away from their accompaniment. Either way, we should expect to see Fleetwood Mac and Lindsey Buckingham on the road later this fall -- just not together, sadly. Will they ever make amends?

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2017-2018 flu season, which took off in November, was categorized as high severity. There was a record rate of hospitalizations, and the flu was the deadliest in four decades, also claiming more pediatric lives \u2014 183 \u2014 than ever before. Alarmingly, 80 percent of the children who died did not receive a flu vaccination, which is the best way to prevent the flu and is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.\nSince 1984, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended annual influenza vaccinations all health workers who have patient contact, though some organizations and individuals view a mandate as an encroachment on an individual's civil rights, and vaccination rates remain at suboptimal levels, though they are improving. Roughly 64 percent of health workers received a flu vaccination during the early 2014-2015 season, according to the Centers for Disease Control, compared with 63 percent a year earlier. By the end of those two seasons, the percentages increased 9 to 12 points.\nObligatory vaccination is not a new concept. In 1905, in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to mandate vaccination if it is necessary for public health or safety of the people. From a public health perspective mandating flu vaccinations is sound policy, as key criteria are met: There is clear medical value from the intervention to the individual and those he or she comes into contact with, and vaccination is considered the only preventive option to the flu.\nMandatory vaccination of children is even more controversial than that of adults. Information from state health departments demonstrates that only Connecticut, New Jersey, Ohio and Rhode Island have a mandatory policy that all children in daycare facilities must be vaccinated annually with the influenza vaccine. This past summer, New York City was granted the authority to mandate vaccinations for all children attending child care or school-based programs.\nConsidering children are at greater risk of serious illness from the flu, mandatory vaccination is justified. Most often children introduce the virus to the household, and vaccination would promote herd immunity and limit widespread illness in the community. Younger children generally have inferior responses to inactivated vaccines, as compared with healthy adults, and children under 9 years of age are recommended to receive two doses the first year that they receive the influenza vaccine. Of the 183 children who died last year from the flu, 58 would still be alive today if they had been vaccinated, according to last year\u2019s vaccine effective rate.\nWhile vaccination rates have improved, we must come together to decrease flu mortality and meet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 objective of 90 percent vaccination rates. From a public health viewpoint, we are obligated to work to mitigate the number of residents affected by the flu in our state and city. An increase in flu vaccinations is associated with reduced hospital admissions and overall patient morbidity and mortality, resulting in cost decrease and a lessened burden on an already overburdened health care system. Additionally, with a healthier workforce there has been less absenteeism and arguably greater productivity.\nPublic health officials should support organizations that require flu vaccination among health care personnel and urge others to follow suit. The health care policy implementation has demonstrated success, which should be used to model and expand vaccination"}

A very loyal friend,\" said his wife of 61 years, the former Phyllis Jane \"Jonnie\" Clegg Norrie.\nMr. Cadwalader grew up mostly at the family's second home in Harford County, graduated from Gilman Country School in 1930 and earned a bachelor's degree in 1934 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he also played lacrosse.\nAn experienced horseman, Mr. Cadwalader enlisted in the Maryland National Guard's 110th Field Artillery regiment and quickly landed an insurance agent job with Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company.\nHe entered active duty in February 1941 and served in Europe from October 1942 until September 1945 with the 110th Field Artillery Battalion of the 29th Division.\nWhile riding a train to London on leave on Nov. 28, 1943, Mr. Cadwalader struck up a conversation with the woman who would later become his wife.

NYC Health + Hospitals CEO Stan Brezenoff sent a letter to the state last week demanding the Cuomo administration turn over $380 million he feels his system is owed. Half of that is city dollars which draw down the federal share.\nThe Cuomo administration has noted that the state is facing a $329 million cut to the DSH program in the current fiscal year and the prudent action is to hold on to last year's cash until a plan to address future shortfalls is agreed upon.\nDe Blasio found that absurd.\n\"For the governor somehow to say New York City hospitals should suffer in the meantime makes no sense,\" de Blasio said. \"I think a lot of New Yorkers would be upset by that. Here is my advice to the governor ... give our public hospitals the resources they have coming to them and don\u2019t turn this into a political football.\"\nRobert Mujica, director of the state budget division, said in a statement that the federal government cut the state\u2019s public hospital funding by $2.8 billion over several years.\n\"This will require hospitals across New York to find efficiencies and the sponsoring governments and institutions to offer assistance.

As a result of the latter very little land is available for private ownership. One resident, Joe Vogler, means to sue the govt. and ask the court to set aside the statehood contract for substantive violation.

Also the residents feel that conservationists and ecologists have had an adverse effect on the state. They simply do not understand that Alaska is not like the Lower Forty-Eight. Nature must be controlled or it will get out of hand. Wolves, for example, are predators, especially toward moose, which are an important source of meat for Alaskans.

A Senate vote was still awaited.\nAlthough there is a wide range of profit estimates for 2018, the expected tax plan benefit has strategists now calling for double-digit profit gains in 2018 over 2017, compared with their forecasts for mid-single-digit gains without the tax cuts.

[Tax] is going to overwhelm everything,\" said Credit Suisse Group U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub, who was waiting for the bill's passage to adjust his own earnings estimates.\nWith the U.S. and world economies expanding, consumer demand strong and interest rates low, corporate profits were expected to be healthy next year. The tax law will give them an added jolt of adrenaline.\nMany strategists estimate the cut in corporate tax could deliver an extra boost to earnings next year of between about 7 percent to more than 10 percent. Some of the forecasts were based on a previous version of the legislation calling for a tax cut to 20 percent.\nIn one of the most recent projections, UBS on Friday said it saw a potential 9.1 percent boost to S&P earnings per share because of the tax plan.\nIt is unclear how great the lasting positive impact will be.\n\"The retention of this benefit is unclear,\" said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, who forecasts the plan could add $19, or about 14 percent, to S&P 500 earnings including potential paybacks from repatriation, with the net recurring benefit likely to be closer to $11, or 8 percent.\nSubramanian, in a presentation earlier this month, said companies may look to use the benefit for short-term lifts. For example, retailers, which have been suffering from competition from Amazon, may want to pass the benefit on with bigger sales and more promotions.\n\"You have to wonder how much of that benefit you're going to really see float to the bottom line on a longer-term basis,\" Subramanian said.\nThe boost to profits goes a long way to justify some of the rapid rise in stock valuations since Donald Trump's election as president a year ago.

Announcements about the cast and shooting schedule have become more and more common, but the latest news has sparked speculation and discussion moreso than the others. James Cameron confirmed that Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang in the original film, will be the villain of all four sequels as well. This is the first time that we've heard about this particular character's exact role in the series. \u2014 previous announcements centered on Jake Worthington's and Zoe Saldana's returns as protagonists Jake and Neyteri respectively; though in all fairness, Lang's involvement with the sequels has long been reported.\nQuaritch did die at the end of the original film, making his return somewhat more surprising. While there is a great deal of fantastical science fiction going on in the world of Pandora, resurrection from the dead has yet to be explored. To recap: Quaritch was obsessed with destroying the Na'vi, but was killed by Saldana's Neyteri before he could destroy the sacred Tree of Souls or kill Worthington's Jake. This seems like a good end for the character, but like the rest of the saga, Cameron would not let him rest, instead saying he would be the villain of the entire saga.\nNot much is known about the plot of the sequels, so this reveal comes as a bit of a surprise. Given that most of the characters had a complete arc in the film, stretching their stories out to fit four more films might be a reach, but Cameron has proved he's more than ready to imagine new worlds and stories. But most of these returning characters weren't dead at the end of their film, which means Cameron will have to imagine a whole new way for Quaritch to cheat death.\nCameron has written himself into a bit of a corner with the character, since it's likely that he was not planning to make him the primary antagonist of five films. But what's done is done, and now Cameron will have to invent a way to bring his villain back from the dead. Luckily for him, he's playing in a sandbox which involves a lot of transferring of consciousnesses. Quaritch's consciousness could easily be transferred into a new avatar of some kind, thus allowing him to return. Similarly, it could give Quaritch a new face, even if Lang is doing the mo-cap. The promise of Lang's return specifically means they won't recast the character, but the visuals of the world do allow for him to return with a new look.\nQuaritch being transferred into a new body before his own demise is an interesting reversal of Jake's own final actions where he is transferred into his new body to live his best life. Quaritch will be sent to a new form in order to essentially live his worst life \u2014 to be a man hellbent on revenge on one specific family. This sets them up as a more interesting protagonist-antagonist duo, with their lives becoming opposites of one another instead of just existing as \"nice soldier\" and \"mean soldier.\"\nIf readers will bear with me a moment, then we can explore exactly how Quaritch's consciousness might have been transferred prior to his own death, despite not being near any equipment or tech that would have preserved him. Eywa, the mysterious force that binds all living things together on Pandora, is proven to exist multiple times throughout the film, most notably when Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) dies before she can be transferred into her avatar and says she can see \"her"}

However, the rupiah is still down 4.3 percent since the start of 2018.\nIn today\u2019s statement BI said it was continuing its strategy of maintaining liquidity in the rupiah money market and foreign exchange market as part of its aim to keep the current account deficit below 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2019.\nIn the third quarter of last year Indonesia\u2019s current account deficit almost doubled to US$8.8 billion, or 3.37 percent of GDP, the widest since the second quarter of 2014, boosted by the rising cost of oil imports.\n\u201cThe BI Board of Governors agreed on 16th and 17th January 2019 to hold the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate at 6.00%, while also maintaining the Deposit Facility (DF) and Lending Facility (LF) rates at 5.25% and 6.75%, respectively. The decision is consistent with ongoing efforts to reduce the current account deficit to a manageable threshold and maintain the attractiveness of domestic financial assets. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia continues monetary operations strategy to maintain adequate liquidity in the Rupiah money market and foreign exchange market in order to support monetary and financial system stability. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue to optimise its policy mix and strengthen coordination with the Government and other relevant authorities in order to maintain economic stability and strengthen external sector resilience, which entails controlling the current account deficit within the threshold of 2.5% of GDP in 2019.\nGlobal economic moderation is continuing despite slightly less uncertainty.

Eleven people, including a 1-year-old child, have been confirmed as having the illness as of Monday morning, though health officials believe this number is likely higher.\nDoctors attribute the outbreak to several causes, including the disease being highly contagious, spreading quickly among close-contact communities. They say the vaccination for it, which children receive twice in childhood, also doesn't always protect people from getting the mumps, making some infectious disease experts believe the effectiveness wanes over time.\nThat has caused a group of Harvard researchers to recently recommend people get a third dose of the shot when they turn 18.\nNone of the experts blame the outbreaks around the country on people who decide not to vaccinate their children at all.\nState health officials say this year's outbreak started after a Mexican dance at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in February. One person confirmed with having the mumps attended a dance a month later at the same location, the state said.\nThe outbreak in Delaware has spread to Chester County in Pennsylvania. The county health department confirmed 19 cases as of March 28.\nDecades ago, it was common for the U.S. to have more than 186,000 cases of the mumps a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the creation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, these numbers have dwindled.\nEven so, in recent years the CDC has seen a substantial increase in the number of mumps casesin the U.S., going from 229 cases in 2012 to 6,366 cases in 2016.\n\"It\u2019s exceedingly rare to die from the mumps,\" said Dr. Awele Maduka-Ezeh, medical director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. \"There can be serious complications.\n\"It's not something we play around with.\"\nMore than 50 years ago, the mumps was a condition that was, for many, a staple of childhood.\nBest known for causing puffy cheeks and swollen jaws, the most common symptom of the highly contagious disease is swollen salivary glands. Other common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite.\nThe creation of the MMR vaccine helped reduce mumps cases by 99 percent in the United States, CDC officials said. In the past decade, the CDC has noticed a rise in mumps outbreaks.\nBecause of this, some local doctors aren't surprised to find mumps in Delaware.\n\"This has been expected and seen unfortunately since 2006,\" said Dr. Craig Shapiro, an infectious disease specialist at Nemours/A.I.

In December there was a further erosion as the revenue forecast fell to $13.393 Billion and the \u201csurplus\u201d shrank to $79.2 Million. The most recent forecast reduced revenue projections by another $182 Million and basically wiped out any remaining surplus.\nThe latest budget forecast now projects a $3.2 Billion shortfall for the 2011-13 general fund budget and we still have at least two (probably three) more \u201cforecasting\u201d updates before setting the next budget with nothing on the horizon to suggest that Oregon\u2019s economy will improve anytime soon.\nI hate to spend time on Oregon\u2019s state budget because it distracts from the real issue facing Oregonians \u2013 jobs. One hundred sixty thousand Oregonians have lost their jobs. Another 40,000 Oregonians have entered the workforce eligibility ranks with no hope of finding a job. Add to that Oregon\u2019s habitual 5.5% unemployment and you have a state in crises and a political class that largely ignores it in favor of talking about the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d facing state government \u2013 as if that\u2019s important to someone who hasn\u2019t had a job in twenty months.\nAnd I hate to spend time on the \u201cbudget crisis\u201d because it really is no crisis at all.

It assumes that all things funded in the previous biennial budget will be preserved in the next budget and increased by a complicated factor based on inflation, programmed increases (mostly wages for public employees) and growth in program recipients. Of the $3.7 Billion in increased spending, slightly more than $900 Million represents salary increases, position increases (step increases) and inflation increases (COLA). And another $368 Million represents the increased cost of PERS. There is another $250 Million in increased debt service reflecting the habit of past legislatures to borrow in order to spend more than revenues would permit.\nRegardless of how much Democrats would like to portray Oregon\u2019s budgetary problems as a revenue problem, it is in fact a spending problem.

She contributed this article to Live Science's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\nRecently, a college senior reached out to me, looking for tips on how to present her research to the public. We went around in circles for a while, until it became clear that the \"public\" she was targeting was the legislature in her fossil-fuel-loving state, her research was on climate change and her question was not, \"How do I make this accessible?\" but rather, \"How do I survive?\"\nI quickly assured her that no one was going to attack her \u2014 that, at worst, people might be dismissive of, or uninterested in, her research. I suggested that other concerns might be more pressing: getting good grades, finding a place in a research lab, securing employment after the completion of her graduate work. As for the public, I finished by saying, \"My goodness; they can't hurt you, they can't fire you and they can't give you an 'F.'\" Afterward, though, I wondered, \"Is that really true?\"\nMy afterthought arose, in part, from several talks I attended later that day by scientists whose research focuses on climate change. Ben Santer is a climate scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and he worked on the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, a definitive assessment of the science. In his remarks, he explained how he found his personal and scientific integrity challenged in the mid-1990s \u2014 not by other scientists, but on the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal.\nSadly, those stories are not unique. It raises the question of whether a Ph.D. in the sciences now requires a secondary degree in law. In fact, the harassment of climate scientists has become so prevalent that a nonprofit group, the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, has popped up for the sole purpose of providing legal counsel to climate scientists.\nIt's not just scientists who experience such pressure; it's science teachers, too. When I first started at the National Center for Science Education, an institution that has spent decades relentlessly defending the teaching of evolution (and, more recently, climate change) in public schools, I was taken aback by the hate mail we received. Within a month, I had a serious conversation with my husband about whether he felt safe with me working there. It is a conversation we have revisited since the birth of our son.\nIt's not these teachers that I'm primarily worried about, however. After all, I'm hearing mainly from teachers who, despite their frustration and misgivings, are impressively standing up to the pressure, withstanding the withering attacks and attempts to compromise the integrity of their science education. Rather, I'm worried about teachers, and aspiring teachers, I'm not hearing from \u2014 those who see such attacks, consider their life circumstances (their families, their job security, etc.), and question whether they, too, could handle such attacks.\nMany people conclude that they could not \u2014 and that is when science education loses, as science teachers leave the field or avoid socially, but not scientifically, controversial topics like evolution or climate change in order to stay under the ideological radar.\nThus, both scientists and science teachers are facing similar challenges.

In the letter, she said the July 5, 1988, death of her sister, Jane Mitchell Souders, 51, has resulted in an eight-year \"nightmare that doesn't go away. Joe has lived a lie for eight years.

At one point during her remarks, Wetzel turned to Souders and said, \"My pastor said I have to forgive you. In my heart of hearts I forgive you, but I will never understand why you did it.\"\nJoseph Souders was arrested in May 1996 and initially charged with criminal homicide and aggravated assault, according to court records.\nWalker told Souders he will be eligible for parole in five years.

A cute movie with a little fawn, and a funny bunny rabbit and a cute little squirrel and it's in a pretty forest and, then, BAM: fire, hunters, parental death, and, zoom, Bambi's now an adult because his dad told him he has to grow up.\nDisney, being the company that it is, has reissued the classic Bambi several times, most recently as a Blu-ray edition in March of this year.\nThe lesser-known sequel,* Bambi II*, is now also available on Blu-ray. I decided to put my childhood trauma away and check out if the sequel is anything like the original.\nThey are both gorgeous movies. The original movie's forest, with its rich colors and sounds, is duplicated almost perfectly for the much-later sequel. The main cast of characters is back, including Thumper, Flower, Owl and Faline. There are some really cute sequences with all of them.\nBut I have to admit, as much as I disliked the original as a kid, the sequel is slighter and less interesting.\nThe best parts of Bambi II are Patrick Stewart as Bambi's father \u2013 the Great Prince of the Forest \u2013 and Thumper, voiced by child actor Brenden Baerg. You have to watch the behind-the-scenes making-of extra just to see this kid. And while it's somewhat odd at first to hear Stewart's voice in the movie, he quickly becomes the best part of it for adults. Stewart sighs a lot, frustrated at being a single father. To amuse myself I started counting them, but I lost track. Still, his sighs have more personality than most actors' dialogue.\nThe movie is sort of a mid-quel, as it takes place within the plot of the first movie. After his mother's death, Bambi's father reluctantly agrees to raise Bambi and teach him the ways of a prince of the forest. Things do not go that well, as Bambi is young, clumsy, and still struggling with his mother's loss. But with the help of his friends and his own inner courage, Bambi begins to gain the skills to survive and thrive. There's a subplot involving another fawn who's bullying Bambi but the rival is never developed beyond a cardboard character which is too bad, because it would have been a nice mirror to find out that he was also struggling with a loss from the fire and handled it a different way than Bambi.\nThe music is okay but nothing that sticks in my head. The Blu-ray edition has more extras than the regular DVD edition, including some computer games. I'd recommend the movie but with the note that while it will entertain them for an afternoon, it's not something your kids will probably fall in love with. There are funny sequences as Bambi stumbles around in the forest that will make the younger ones laugh but nothing in the story that resonates."}

It's fun.\"\nDavis, who's the founder of the luxury real estate agency Domicile, wears heels all the time, whether she's heading out to dinner or climbing the stairs of a building she's selling. Nowadays, she works a lot with investment firms and individuals looking for commercial properties on King Street, although she does some residential selling too.

The only time she's gone around in flats for more than a workout was this past summer when she tore her meniscus. \"The doctor said, 'The one thing you have to get rid of is those shoes,' and I said, 'Tell me anything else.' But I made some concessions while I was recovering, which took about two or three months,\" she says.\nAsking her to pick a favorite pair of shoes is almost like asking her to pick a favorite child (of whom she has four \u2014 it was to support them that she went into brokerage in the first place). \"I've had so many favorites,\" she says.

But when talking about the subject that occupies her mind these days, the prospect of becoming a home\u00adowner, she is admittedly terrified. Her fears run the gamut, from the risks of assuming a substantial mortgage \u2014 \"It is certainly cheaper for me to rent,\"\u009d she acknowledged in a recent chat over coffee \u2014 to uncertainty about whether she'd ever be able to sell her property for a profit.\nAnd yet, she's on a relentless quest to escape her rented apartment by purchasing a detached, single-family home with more living space than she actually needs. \"Honestly, I think it is a status mark,\"\u009d Perlow said. \"If you meet someone who is a homeowner, you think, \"\u02dcThey're stable, they have a good job, and they're responsible.' As a single woman, when I meet a man, and he owns his own home, I view that as an attractive quality. I'm 30. It's about time to start my life.\"\u009d And with that pert thought, she turned wistful. \"I just want it to be mine,\"\u009d she said of the home that she is scared \u2014 but not too scared \u2014 to buy.\nFor many if not most Americans, the dream of homeowner\u00adship abides. The meltdown of the nation's housing markets dating to 2007 touched off the nation's worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Still, a survey last year by government housing-finance giant Fannie Mae found that 80 percent of Americans \u2014 including 77 percent of renters \u2014 believe that a high rate of homeownership is important to the economy.\nThe ripe question, though, is whether homeownership should be viewed as a holy grail. Not only the citizenry but Washington has treated homeownership as a universal ideal. Any mortgage that Perlow would obtain is apt to be backed by the federal government, which currently supports 92 percent of all newly issued home loans. The government has long used its vast powers to promote an ever-rising rate of homeownership: \"The higher, the better\"\u009d was the credo of Democrats and Republicans alike, aiming to give people a tangible stake in their communities. The modern apostle of homeownership's blessings was a Republican, Herbert Hoover, who adopted the cause as Warren Harding's Commerce secretary in 1921-23. \"For it is mainly through the hope of enjoying the ownership of a home that the latent energy of any citizenry is called forth,\"\u009d Hoover proclaimed.\nAs the Great Depression receded, the homeownership rate did increase, from 44 percent in 1940 to a peak of 69.2 percent in mid-2004. The recent housing crash and the wave of foreclosures that followed lowered the rate to 66.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to Census Bureau figures, and market forces may yet shrink it further. Is that OK, perhaps even healthy? Is it high time for the nation to jettison the goal of homeownership for all American households that President Clinton embraced in the 1990s? If so, should renters receive more assistance?\nAs the Obama administration and Congress try to map a post-bubble future for housing policy, a lot rides on the answers to these questions.

{"idx": "7629", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: LAST week I was highlighting our defensive resolve since the start of September. Three goals conceded in six games has been swiftly followed by four in two. What do they usually say about commentator\u2019s curse?\nThe two trips to Leamington and Bradford (Park Avenue) put those in attendance through the wringer. In both games, the high of excellent football and deserved goals was burst by fits of spectacularly low confidence and poor defending.\nIf you weren\u2019t there to witness the two games, it\u2019s probably hard to comprehend just how wildly the swings were between good play with purpose and aggression, to the feeble defending with the whole side looking like they\u2019d been thrown in to the deep end making their senior debut.\nOne-touch passing with pace and movement was quickly followed by a breakdown in the basic fundamentals of the game like marking and simple passing.\nFor me, the frustrating thing from the two games is for the majority of both we played more than well enough to win. We could be in a much better place in the league if we just converted spells of good football into a whole 90-minute match-winning performance. Most games swing one way to another, but at some point we are going to have to become a bit more resilient to the pressure which will inevitably come regardless of whether we\u2019re playing the best team in the league or the worst.\nAll teams can look pretty decent going forward. Whichever team finishes bottom will have spells of looking like a much better side than their league position suggests. What makes the difference ultimately is how sides deal with the pressure applied by the opposition. The team that finishes top at the end of the season dealt with it the best. The side which finishes bottom didn\u2019t deal with it. As things stand, we\u2019re somewhere between the bottom and the middle.\nEven if you discount the couple of games where we have been properly taken apart, there are other games where we\u2019ve had the lead or should have had it which if we\u2019d dealt better with what was thrown at us we would be in a more positive position in the league than where we are right now. Is it really such a massive ask for us to be a bit more resilient?\nWith a mid-table finish becoming more and more likely, I can\u2019t help but look upon the side we have put together and compare it to the Darlo sides of the mid-1990s. Back then, usually due to us being one of the poorest clubs in the league \u2013 something we\u2019d struggle to claim these days - we inevitably ended up with naturally gifted players but who were probably not the most athletically gifted or weren\u2019t the greatest football thinkers. They always seemed to be on the small side too.\nIt was the natural fit for a club paying some of the lowest wages in the league. Of course, Jim Platt managed to get blood from a stone to get us to the playoff final in 1996, although more often than not our flashy but ultimately low on substance players tried their hardest for the cause but rarely troubled the teams with more money and purpose.\nMaybe I\u2019m clutching at straws, but there is still a chance we could replicate the 1995-96 season this year. There are striking similarities between that season and this. We made a poor start. We weren\u2019t particularly great at home. We only lost once on the road and that was a drubbing.

The program is designed to lower licensing costs for IBM products and simplify the licensing process for young companies.\nStart-ups with annual revenues under $10 million will receive a standard, three-year cross-licensing contract for $25,000, said Michelle McIntyre, a spokeswoman for IBM Venture Capital Group.\nCompanies with more than $10 million in annual revenues that are in the process of bringing their products to market receive a custom, five-year cross-licensing contract and pay 1 percent in royalties.

Some of the participating VCs include Walden International, U.S. Venture Partners and 3i.\nBig Blue's cross-licensing program is the company's latest effort to strengthen its relationship with young companies in the hope that its software and hardware will be used in a start-up's emerging products. The relationship also provides IBM with a glimpse of emerging technology trends.\nIBM's approach is also different from those of other Fortune 500 companies. It spends less time making direct investments in start-ups as a strategic partner and instead invests in funds run by venture capitalists.

With the rising costs of higher education, many students and parents are looking for a return on their investment. This year, data from Bankrate.com as well US Census Bureau indicates that STEM majors are again at the top of the list of the most lucrative majors. Of course, this should not be a big surprise, considering many sectors of the economy are powered by STEM innovation. Thus, majoring in the STEM fields leads to a higher salary. Last year I wrote an article which highlighted the top 5 paid bachelors degrees, and unsurprisingly they were also in STEM, though this year mix looks a bit different. So let's take a look at the most popular majors ranked byBankrate.com, as well as their earning potential. Moreover, let's explain what these majors entail because choosing a major is not all in the numbers, it is also about the passion for the study matter itself.\nApplied mathematicians study mathematics in the hopes of applying the principles and theories to the real world. They are less concerned about the theoretical notions or proofs, rather they are interested in modeling processes, and applying the laws of mathematics to understand the world around us. There are range of positions for people with an applied math skillset, and those can range from finance to research to engineering, depending on interest as well as the other skillsets and experiences. It is a great major for those are very numbers oriented and are fascinated by mathematics.\nHealth and medical preparatory programs entail a curriculum which is a combination of physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology, that prepares one for entry into the medical professions. This could be medical school, a job as a physicians assistant or a nurse practitioner. Many of the students who major in these areas are fascinated by the medical sciences, patient care, and clinical treatment of various diseases.\nNuclear engineering students focus on an engineering heavy curriculum that is focused on nuclear reactions, radiation, biophysics, nuclear materials, medical imagining and fusion power. Many of the students go on to work in national labs, federal or state regulatory agencies as well as in the industry. Their jobs involves developing and designing equipment, as well as making sure activities abide by the state and federal regulatory laws.\nZoology students study biology with an emphasis on animal species. They study the habitats of animals, their interaction with the ecosystems, as well the impact humans have on those habitats and wildlife. Zoologists can work in national parks, state or federal governmental agencies, various laboratories, centers for education, as well as museums and environmental groups.\nThe highest paid major is actuarial science. This major involves the study of statistics and mathematics, with an emphasis on assessing and understanding risk. The jobs in this major are found in the insurance and finance field, where mathematical models and statistical methods are applied to understand risk and uncertainty, as well as finding ways to minimize those."}

Bono, on the other hand, had removed himself to a quiet back room, where he was keeping company with a plump, middle-aged white guy in a suit and tie. (Bono was wearing a T-shirt and a fuzzy sweater whose sleeve needed mending.) This was Randall Tobias, head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS. Another kind of activist might have said, \"That leaves 25 million more to go.\" But not Bono: he looked his cornfed interlocutor in the eye and said, \"You should know what an incredible difference your work is going to make in their lives.\" Tobias looked embarrassed. Bono said various wonderful things about President Bush. Tobias beamed.\nIn mid-2000, Bono received an audience with Senator Jesse Helms, viewed by Bono's fellow lefties, including members of the band, as the archfiend himself. Bono quickly realized that his usual spiel about debt service and so on wasn't making a dent. So, he recalls: \"I started talking about Scripture. I talked about AIDS as the leprosy of our age.\" Married women and children were dying of AIDS, he told the senator, and governments burdened by debt couldn't do a thing about it. Helms listened, and his eyes began to well up. Finally the flinty old Southerner rose to his feet, grabbed for his cane and said, \"I want to give you a blessing.\" He embraced the singer, saying, \"I want to do anything I can to help you.\" [Former Congressman John] Kasich, who was watching from a couch, says, \"I thought somebody had spiked my coffee.\"\nBono told [Condoleezza] Rice that he would appear with Bush at an event promoting the president's development-assistance program if Bush would also commit to \"a historic AIDS initiative.\" The day before the planned appearance, in March, Bono learned that the president would not do so. He was now playing for dizzyingly high stakes. Virtually everyone around Bono despised Bush; and now some of his most trusted advisers urged him to deny the administration his precious gift of legitimacy. And Bono, in an uncharacteristic act of confrontation, called Rice and said he was pulling out of the joint appearance.\nRice was very unhappy. She recalls telling him, \"Bono, this president cares about AIDS, too, and let me tell you that he is going to figure out something dramatic to do about AIDS.\" But, she added, \"You're going to have to trust us.\" Bono accepted her pledge. According to Scott Hatch, a former aide to the Republican House leadership whom Bono hired to help him gain access to conservatives, \"Bono really took it on the chin from the left for dealing with a Republican president.\" But Bono says he felt that the administration deserved praise for the aid package; and he trusted the Bush White House, though his friends thought him ludicrously na\u00c3\u00afve. He says that he has not regretted his trust. \"I have found personally that I have never been overpromised,\" he says. \"In fact, the opposite -- they tell me they won't do something, and finally they do it.\"\nAs he was being taken to meet Bush,"}

In his two decades in charge Tom turned the situation around. He quickly spotted the opportunities the nascent IFSC created for the ISE.\nFrom being a market exclusively focused on domestic shares and government bonds, Dublin under Tom's leadership looked outward to the wider world.\nIn 1990 the first listed fund made its debut on the Irish Stock Exchange while the first debt fund listed in 2000. The exchange is now number one in the world for listed funds and number two for debt funds. Then in 1995 the Irish Stock Exchange became an independent market once again after more than two decades as part of the London Stock Exchange.\nA native of Co Westmeath, Tom graduated from Trinity and spent five years in various roles with the IDA. However, it was during his seven years as communications manager with the Irish Trade Board that he first became widely known. Even so, without a financial background, his appointment as ISE chief executive in 1987, came as something of a surprise.\nIn the mid-1980s the Irish Stock Exchange was an extremely traditional, not to say stuffy, institution. Trading was dominated by a handful of brokers and all deals took place on the floor of the Exchange's Anglesea Street headquarters. Just to make matters worse, the imposition of exchange controls following the break with sterling in 1979 meant that Irish investors couldn't own shares in overseas companies, even those of companies that used their shares to buy Irish listed companies.\nThe Irish Stock Exchange went over a decade, from 1973 to 1986, with no new companies joining its main market.\nInto all of this Tom came as a breath, more a gale actually, of fresh air. A market that seemed to have no future was revived. And it wasn't just overseas business. Under Tom's leadership a host of Irish companies including Glanbia, Aryzta, Kingspan, Ryanair and Paddy Power Betfair joined the Irish Stock Exchange and became world beaters.\nBy the time Tom stepped down in 2007, the ISE was recording annual operating profits of over \u20ac10m.\nTom then became head of the new Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange before retiring in 2010.\nA warm host and a good friend, Tom will be deeply missed by all of those of us who were privileged to have known him."}

Isaiah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling his fellow Israelites to dream big, because God is eventually going to heal all of that, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to send them a good king faithful to their relationship with God, God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to install a government that will bring peace to the people and justice to the nation.\nMany people are quite surprised by how much the prophets talk about good government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related to why Jesus is called Wisdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prophet. The language in the gospels about Jesus as Lord is a direct contrast and challenge to Caesar as Lord, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a commentary on the unjust government that Jesus and his neighbors are experiencing. When you think about government in Lake Forest, Chicago, Illinois, or this nation, what do you hope for?\nThose Pharisees and Sadducees don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to think about better government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to focus on the details of religious forms in their own lives. Transformation that leads to new relationships and just government is challenging. What are we afraid of?\nIf we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch our own deep fears, then maybe we can listen to all the public communication around us that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled with doom and gloom. The great majority of Americans are afraid of not being able to make it. The reported unemployment rate in this part of Illinois may only be about 10%, but there are at least another 15-20% who are underemployed or still not making enough to support themselves, particularly if they are male, minority, younger, or less educated. The state of Illinois is #10 in foreclosure rates. Personal bankruptcy filings are up two or three times over what they were 5 years ago. Chicago is in the midst of unprecedented budget cuts, which are going to hurt most those least able to survive them.\nWhere is hope in the face of statistics like that? What keeps"}

The hearing board argued that Rohrich's property violated the terms of its building permit \u2014 which prohibited \"living quarters\" \u2014 because the second floor of his garage contained plumbing, a shower and rooms that could be used to sleep in.\nJudge D. Gregory Geary wrote in an 18-page ruling that the garage cannot be considered a second dwelling without a kitchen.\n\"When one views the second story improvements objectively, all that is there is a place to sleep and shower, albeit rather comfortably,\" he wrote. \"Those accommodations are well-suited for a transient or temporary stay to be sure, but they simply do not amount to what one would commonly consider as a residence.\"\nRohrich said the borough was on a \"witch hunt.\" He argued that his garage was the first ever to be subject to inspection. The issue has been ongoing since 2006.\n\"Our plans were always laid out with what we were going to do with the garage,\" he said when reached at home Wednesday night. \"It was never going to be a guesthouse, but they (borough council) made the assumption.\"\nBorough Mayor Mike Miscoe said the ruling opens the door for other residents looking to convert their garage into a guesthouse.\nThe borough's zoning ordinance restricts duel residences on properties because of regulations on sewage.\nResidences obtain sewage permits based on the number of bedrooms in the home. The rationale is that bedrooms equate to the number of occupants utilizing the restroom.\n\"What if everyone does this?\" Miscoe asked. \"It overburdens the sewage system.\"\nCouncil President Patricia Dewar said the precedent is unfair to borough residents.\n\"It's unfair to those who spent the time and money (to comply),\" she said.\nThe borough voted 4-2 against appealing the ruling. Councilmen Lynn Shimer and Terry St. Clair voted to pursue the appeal.\nCouncilman Robert Marhefka said he voted against appealing to save borough tax dollars. Borough Solicitor Dan Rullo estimated the cost to appeal to be between $5,000 and $10,000.\n\"We talk about cutting costs and trying to scour the budget for savings,\" Marhefka said, \"and then we throw it away on legal costs.\"\nRohrich said he spent more than $10,000 on legal costs in his defense. He said he offered to settle the dispute financially with the borough outside of court, but an agreement could not be reached.\n\"The real shame in all of this is that borough residents are paying for this,\" he said.\nBorough Council plans to revisit its zoning ordinance pertaining to the matter in the coming months."}
{"idx": "7656", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.\nI have to admit that this lede confused me. I think it might have been a good idea to define tithing more precisely for the purposes of the story. Judging from most -- but not all -- of the remaining anecdotes and reportage, the backlash is against the view that giving ten percent of one's income is a biblical requirement. But that's not how Sateline defines it, exactly.\nMany Christians who don't read the Bible literally say that by tithing they are not misreading the text, but rather interpreting it differently. Tithing has its roots in the Biblical tale of Abraham presenting a tenth of the war spoils to Melchizedek, the king of Salem. In the Old Testament, Jews brought 10% of their harvest to a storehouse as a welfare plan for the needy or in case of famine. That percentage, say pro-tithers, can be a useful guideline for Christians today. \"It's the best financial discipline I know,\" says Terry Parsons, stewardship officer for the Episcopal Church.\nFor Judy Willingham, of San Antonio, 12 years of tithing came to an end earlier this year. She says she gave a tenth of her pay to Cornerstone Church because the pastor, the Rev. John C. Hagee teaches, \"'If you obey God and you tithe, God will return it to you 30, 60, 100 fold.'\"\nMs. Willingham, who earns $26,000 annually as an administrative assistant, says she started to research the practice, reading criticism online and studying the Bible, and concluded that she'd been \"guilted into tithing.\" She quit the church and hasn't found another one.\nSteve Sorensen, director of pastoral ministries at Cornerstone, says the church requires its paid and volunteer leaders to tithe, and teaches new members to do so, although it doesn't make them show proof of income. \"When you tithe, God makes promises to us, that he ... is not going to let anything bad or destructive come about,\" says Mr. Sorensen. For those who don't tithe, he says the Lord \"is not obligated to do those things for you.\"\nMr. Rohr, 35, is now supporting his family by driving trucks. He says he still believes what he wrote to Mr. Engel: \"All decisions to give and how much to give are between the believer and their God, not meant to be used as stumbling blocks or judgments against others.\"\nI am somewhat upset that my name and book was not mentioned.

Cmdr. Michael Metz with the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley.\nA towing vessel was pushing 15 loaded coal barges upstream toward Trimble County on Tuesday night when one barge hit the Clark Memorial Bridge, causing all barges to break free and float downriver, according to the Coast Guard.\nNo one was injured, and an investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.\nIn the meantime, the nine barges could cause problems, said Shawn Kenney, assistant operations manager for the Army Corps of Engineers Louisville District.\nOne underwater barge is blocking a gate from closing at the dam, Kenney said, adding that could be problematic given higher-than-usual river levels right now.\n\"If we have reduced flow conditions, then we could see a situation where we need to close that gate,\" Kenney said. \"And if that barge is not removed, that will prevent us from holding our pool (level) the way we need to.\"\nIf the barge keeps blocking the dam gate, vessel traffic on the river could be stopped because the water wouldn't be deep enough for watercraft to pass through, Kenney said.\nOn Thursday, the Coast Guard reopened vessel traffic on the river, but it's permitted only during daylight hours and with an assist vessel.\nSix of the barges that came loose from the vessel were recovered last week. Nine barges got stuck at the dam just above the falls on the Ohio River, the Army Corps of Engineers reported.\nThe Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers are working with Tennessee Valley Towing, the owner of the Debbie Graham towing vessel, to recover the remaining two barges as well as the seven that sank, Metz said.\nWhile Metz said crews will work \"around the clock\" to recover all barges, it is not known how long the recovery process could take.\nThe water level at the McAlpine Dam fell approximately one foot last week, causing two additional barges to sink and making recovery efforts unsafe, Metz said.\nBy Wednesday, one additional barge sank and the water level at the McAlpine Dam rose, Metz said.\nDetails are still being finalized, but crews would typically pull the two floating barges first and then attempt to recover the seven that are under water, Metz said.\nBids are still being accepted for the salvaging work, Kenney said, adding that it may take until late next week for work to begin on the underwater barges.\nMetz and Kenney said Tennessee Valley Towing will likely be responsible for any costs associated with the recovery efforts and any infrastructure damage. However, officials said they had not observed any damage to the Clark Memorial Bridge or dam as a result of this week's incident.\nEach barge typically holds between 1,500 and 1,750 tons of coal.\nA majority of the coal is likely still on the barges, including the submerged ones, Kenney said. Crews will attempt to unload the coal from each barge during recovery efforts.\nAny coal spilled in the river is not expected to affect Louisville's drinking water, Louisville Water Co. officials said.\nThe Kentucky Division of Water is monitoring the situation but otherwise"}

As the primary \u201cmechanosensing\u201d cells, osteocytes orchestrate bone\u2019s adaptation processes under mechanical cues such as exercise.\n\u201cWe suspected that the response of diabetic bone to mechanical loading would be compromised due to impaired mechanosensing of osteocytes under hyperglycemic, or high blood sugar, conditions,\u201d she says.\nThe study demonstrated that exercise-induced bone formation was maintained in mildly diabetic mice at a similar level as non-diabetic controls, while the positive effects of exercise were nearly abolished in severely diabetic mice. At the cellular level, the researchers found that hyperglycemia reduced the sensitivity of osteocytes to mechanical stimulation and suppressed osteocytes\u2019 secretion of proteins and signaling molecules that help build stronger bone.\n\u201cOur work demonstrates that diabetic bone can respond to exercise when the hyperglycemia is not severe, which suggests that mechanical interventions may be useful to improve bone health and reduce fracture risk in mildly affected diabetic patients,\u201d Wang says.\nTo translate the findings of the study to patient care, Wang\u2019s team has begun to collaborate with Dr. Jim Lenhard, director of the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases at Christiana Care Health System.\n\u201cDecreased bone strength and an increase in fragility fractures is one of the least recognized complications of diabetes,\u201d says Lenhard.\nThe plan for collaboration between the University of Delaware and Christiana Care is to evaluate these research findings in humans and expand the research to include other complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease.\n\u201cThe leading cause of death in America is cardiovascular disease, and the majority of people with diabetes will die from this,\u201d Lenhard adds.\nThe paper was co-authored by Wang and X.

No matter how busy you are, there's always time for a shakedown.\nIn the Electronic Arts action game The Godfather, it is easy to become distracted from the game's central story, wandering off to rob a bank, buy a shady business or steal a rival mob's truck.\nBased on the movie, the game is done in the style of the Grand Theft Auto video games, with the same mix of shooting and driving in a large, open environment. While the \"Godfather\" movie and Grand Theft Auto 3 are considered significant works in their respective fields, I consider both overrated, so I was surprised to find myself tremendously entertained by this game.\nThe Godfather begins in 1936 as the player takes on the role of a low-level Mafia thug working for the Corleone family. To make money for the family, you need to get local shop owners to pay protection. Some will agree if you just ask politely, but most need convincing. You can scare them into submission by throwing them through windows, breaking up their stores, aiming a gun at their sensitive points or killing their customers.\nMost of the shops are already protected by one of the rival families, and threatening a shop owner can result in prompt action from nearby thugs. Before I started my negotiations I would generally steal a car and run down any mobsters standing guard outside, then take out the rest in a blaze of bullets. Sometimes I would be able to sneak up behind a thug lurking in an alley and garrote him. A room full of enemies could be cleared with a stick of dynamite or a Molotov cocktail.\nThe game is entertaining on its own merits, but undoubtedly is the most fun for fans of the movie who get to take orders from characters voiced by actors from the movie, including James Caan and Marlon Brando (who recorded some of the dialogue shortly before his death, the rest being done by an impressionist).\nThe rise from thug to made man involves outrunning cops, bribing F.B.I. agents, flirting with party girls and throwing mobsters off roofs or into bakers' ovens. Success gains you citywide respect, and the pedestrians who at first insult you as you pass by will later nod pleasantly and even apologize when you bump into them.\nThe game's attempt to create a vast, thriving city is undercut by a lack of variety. The Godfather's New York apparently has only a single architect: when you've seen one nightclub or butcher shop, you know how all the others will look. And while the game focuses heavily on driving, there are only seven models of cars.\nWhile The Godfather's limitations quickly become apparent, the same cannot be said of Bethesda Softworks' action role-playing game Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, a game so vast and varied that it would probably take hundreds of hours of play to see and experience everything, if that is possible at all.\nOblivion takes place in a standard fantasy universe of elves and orcs where you have been imprisoned for unexplained reasons. You are soon freed by an emperor who needs access to a secret passage in your cell, and when he is assassinated you are charged with"}

Border patrol agents are the first officials who come into contact with migrants, and the thinking is that they'll be less sympathetic than asylum officers. And officials have been considering raising asylum standards and changing the court system so that the last people in are the first to have their cases adjudicated. Some of the ideas have been proposed, rejected and then proposed again.\nThe administration has also been weighing targeting the remittance payments sent home by people living in the country illegally. And White House aide Stephen Miller in particular has been pushing Homeland Security officials to move forward with plans to punish immigrants in the country legally for using public benefits, such as food stamps.\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said both are topics of focus for the White House.\n\"It is a top priority for the administration, as has been for two years, to reduce overstay rates for visas and the visa waiver program \u2014 and it's well known that the administration is working to ensure faithful implementation of immigration welfare rules to protect American taxpayers,\" he said.\nAt the same time, Trump suggested Monday that his threat to send migrants to so-called sanctuary cities in an apparent effort to exact revenge on Democratic foes is taking effect, even though it remains unclear whether such a plan is feasible.\n\"Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!\" Trump tweeted just days after aides insisted the plan had been shelved.\nPresident Donald Trump went to Calexico, California, on Friday to meet with ICE officials and talk about immigration. During a roundtable discussion, Trump said the \"country is full\" and suggested people trying to reach the U.S. \"turn around.\"\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests for comment on what, if anything, had changed Monday.

Experts from the Regional Center of Climate for West South America (CRC-OSA), composed of metrological entities from Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, concluded that since April 24th the Pacific Ocean has presented precursory conditions for El Ni\u00f1o, according to their official website.\nThe probability that El Ni\u00f1o will start in mid-2014 and last until the beginning of 2015 has also risen, Semana reported.\nThe WMO report stated that while tropical Pacific Ocean surface temperatures \u201chave reached El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s thresholds and exceeded them in the far eastern portion of the basin,\u201d the weather phenomenon has not yet begun in full force.

Passersby were treated to a show of journalists in bright blue Hondas whipping around tight corners on one of two closed courses. There was one sound missing, though; the sound of meaty exhaust. While most track sessions are filled with a musical score of engine exhausts, this one was much quieter, burning rubber aside. Why? The bright blue cars that the journalists were testing are electric vehicles, the new Honda Fit EV to be exact.\nHonda will be delivering the first EVs to customers in select markets in California and Oregon on July 20, but several lucky journalists, including myself, were treated to a ride-and-drive event in advance of the official vehicle launch.\nWhen I first saw the Honda Fit EV, I was surprised by its size. I had expected the vehicle to be much smaller and even though it is a subcompact, it was far roomier than I thought it would be. There was ample headspace and plenty of legroom in both the front and back seats. While this all-electric vehicle is designed for the daily commuter, I could comfortably fit my entire family in the car for trips to and from ballet, tennis, birthday parties and the grocery store.\nWhile learning more about the Fit EV on Tuesday night, several Honda employees told me that it was a fun vehicle to drive. Prior to this event I\u2019d never driven an all-electric vehicle, and while I didn\u2019t know what it would feel like to drive one, fun was never an adjective that came to mind. Practical, yes, but never fun.\nThat changed when I finally had the chance to get behind the wheel of the Honda Fit EV on Wednesday morning. I chose to start on the shorter of the two closed courses and was instructed to accelerate rapidly from the launch, keep an eye out on the radar for my trap time and then brake at the red flags in preparation for the first corner.\nI giggled inside at the thought of a trap time. I\u2019ve been on a quarter-mile drag strip before and I know what it feels like to race down the track trying to get the best time possible. I did not think that my little jaunt down a closed course in an electric vehicle would be nearly as exciting. This was the second time that I was mistaken with my preconceived notions about the Fit EV.\nOnce I lined up the car\u2019s mirrors with the green flags I put the pedal to the metal and immediately burned rubber as the tires spun in an attempt to gain traction. This was one torque-y little electric vehicle and for me, torque makes for a fun driving experience. I quickly accelerated without the loud and rumbling exhaust that I\u2019m used to, and that made me smile. Yes, I was smiling like a giddy schoolgirl as I raced down toward the red flags.\nMy first trap time was only 36 mph; I\u2019m not sure of the distance between the green flags and the red flags but I\u2019d venture to say that it was about 1/16 of a mile.

Under such a program, the city would charge the fees on new commercial and multi-family residential construction in denser parts of the city. Developers argue that the cost of the fees would jack up rental and purchase prices for property, undermining the Council's affordability goals. And in a letter sent to council members last week, a group of land use attorneys questioned whether the envisioned fees are even legal under state law.\nCouncilmember Mike O'Brien helped shepherd the resolution through the committee process. Despite the misgivings property developers and some of his fellow councilmembers have expressed, he believes it was time for the Council to take a stance on the fees.\n\"We're seeing a ton of interest in new development in Seattle,\" O'Brien said during an interview after the Council vote. \"It's having a real impact on affordability and I think now is the time to address it.\"\n\"This is not an easy position to take,\" he added. \"Developers in this community are, you know, not just developers; a lot of our leading civic leaders are in the development community and to have seven Councilmembers stand up and say, 'we respect developers' positions but we want to move forward on this,' is really a reflection of where the public is on this right now.\"\nCouncilmembers Sally Bagshaw and Tom Rasmussen cast the two no-votes.\n\"I have very serious concerns with the prescriptive nature of this resolution,\" Rasmussen said during the meeting. \"It reinforces the belief that the Council has already made up its mind.\"\nThe resolution is only an initial step toward the fee program, which would need to be finalized with a city ordinance. The resolution says that the Council should aim to phase in the fees over a three-year period beginning on Oct. 1, 2015.\nThe resolution also includes a projected fee structure that is based on a study the Council commissioned from an outside consultant. The fees vary depending on where a project is located and are charged for each square foot of \"rentable\" area (space devoted to uses such as walls or mechanical equipment is exempt). In parts of the city where residential and commercial property prices are lower, the projected per-square-foot fee range is $5 to $7; in medium cost areas it is $10-$12; and in high cost areas it is $16-$22.\nA map included with the resolution shows low-cost areas along corridors such as Lake City Way and Rainier Avenue South, while high-cost areas, where the fees would be set at the upper level, include neighborhoods in Downtown and South Lake Union.\nDuring Monday's meeting, Bagshaw put forward an amendment that would have eliminated the fee figures from the resolution.

Sponsored by The Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, a Harvard-based institute dedicated to the vision of hiphop, Elektrik Revival is an immersive collection of contemporary works set in the black South using mediums such as character sketches and graphic novels. This show aims ambitiously, and decisively, to display the vastness of the black imagination while still addressing strong social themes. Ohio based visual artist Bryan Moss was elated to be a part of the exhibition.\nMoss was selected by curator John Jennings to have his illustrations--which vividly depict a fearless foray into afro-futurism\u2014prominently displayed in the exhibit. And as inventive and gorgeous as Moss\u2019 art is, he credits his participation to the power of the tribe. \"I met John a couple of years ago at Sol-Con, a comic book convention aimed specifically at minorities,\u201d says Moss. \u201cThen we connected through social media and he shared an idea he had for comics about afro-futurism...a new aesthetic with a sci-fi spin on it for people of color which was right up my alley. It happened so naturally because there is a network of black artists actively making work who strongly support each other.\"\nThe 35-year-old knew from a young age that he was destined to be an artist. \"People who wouldn't typically pay attention to me when I was a kid...upper middle class people or people who were affluent were like 'oh you make art?' and would talk to me about it,\u201d Moss continues. \u201cIt was a good platform to have a conversation even when I was just drawing a picture. I recognized very quickly that it would be my way out of poverty.\"\nMoss grew up on the South Side of Columbus with his parents and five siblings. Before teaching drawing and painting at the Columbus Museum of Art, he owned a T-shirt design business to rake in some extra cash after taking in his youngest sister, Kari, when he was in his mid-20s. His upbringing played an important role in terms of how he would later navigate his career. \"I'm bi-racial--my father is black and my mother is white. I identify as a black male and being a part of two very different worlds, I learned how the art game is played and it's not just exclusive to just Columbus,\" Moss clarifies.\n\"There is a general understanding that the people who wrote the history of western art are all white males. Now there's this moment where we--meaning people of color--want representation in these spaces. The most effective way to gain access to them is through educational channels because many museums and galleries want to train the public and don't want to be perceived a certain way. They were more receptive to that angle than me just going into a museum saying 'show my art' because it just doesn't work that way. There's a system in place and learning how to use it was my main goal.\" Moss now works full time as an artist and divides his time at Columbus Museum of Art, teaching private lessons, and mentoring young people.\nOver the last few years, he has had his work highlighted with Art Makes Cbus, a campaign started by the Columbus Arts Council to showcase artists in the city who help sustain its culture.

{"idx": "7705", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In June of 1921, F. W. Woolworth Company opened a new 5, 10, and 15 cent store on the corner of E. Houston and Alamo Streets, where the Maverick Bank Building once stood. The $225,000 building had been designed by Adams and Adams. This local architectural firm went on to design other noteworthy structures, including Jefferson High School, the Hall of State for the Texas Centennial in Dallas, and the Alamo Cenotaph, featuring Pompeo Coppini's sculptures.\nWoolworth's, a popular national discounter, first came to San Antonio in 1912. As the \"oldest Woolworth store in Texas,\" it prospered enough to erect a new three-story building \"on San Antonio's most prominent corner.\" The newspaper ad announcing Woolworth's formal opening boasted that, \"We have added a number of features to our service \u2013 but the one which you will appreciate most is our soda fountain and lunch counter.\" This lunch counter, touted by the local manager as the largest in the city, later catapulted San Antonio into civil rights history.\nOn March 16, 1960, Woolworth's became one of six local stores that peacefully desegregated their lunch counters. No sit-in demonstrations were held, thanks to the cooperation of church leaders, store managers, and members of the NAACP, who orchestrated the policy change behind the scenes. The Express-News photographed history in the making at the Woolworth's cafeteria on Alamo Plaza, where the store's equal service policy helped San Antonio acquire the distinction of being \"the first city in the South to receive publicity for the desegregation of its lunch counters.\" Woolworth's, by virtue of its size, location, and company prominence, played a key role in elevating San Antonio to the national stage of civil rights history as a positive example in race relations. Jackie Robinson, the African American baseball star who helped integrate the major leagues, declared the event a story that \"should be told around the world.\"\nThe Woolworth Building became part of the Alamo Plaza National Register Historic District in 1977. Inclusion in the city's local landmark district followed in 1978. The State of Texas purchased this building, along with the adjacent Palace Theater and Crockett Block, in December 2015. Two months later, Preservation Texas added Woolworth's to its 2016 Most Endangered Places list, reflecting the uncertainty of the building's fate during the Alamo master planning process.\nThe Alamo Master Plan approved by City Council in 2017 endorsed the reuse of the Woolworth Building, along with the Crockett Block and Palace Theater, as part of a planned Alamo Museum. During the interpretive planning of 2018, Mayor Ron Nirenberg, District 1 Councilman Roberto Trevi\u00f1o, City Manager Sheryl Sculley, and County Judge Nelson Wolff went on the record supporting preservation of the three historic buildings. However, the 2018 interpretive plan approved by the Alamo Citizen Advisory Committee contradicted the earlier master plan by keeping the option open for the demolition of the Palace and Woolworth Buildings.\nToo many sites with historic ties to the African-American experience have been lost or marginalized, marked only by a plaque, if at all.

{"idx": "7706", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Application Data Management suite monitors growth of databases, eliminates large production database copies.\nOuterBay Technologies on Monday will roll out its Application Data Management suite, software that allows enterprises to monitor and manage data growth.\nThe ADM suite consists of three key components: ARM (Application Resource Manager), Instance Generator and LiveArchive.\nARM allows users to monitor, detect, diagnose and resolve data growth thats gotten out of hand. The tool provides data analysis for data growth management and performance optimization, such as analysis of existing data growth, data growth forecasts and \"what-if\" analysis of potential data policies.\nPrior to this release, ARM was limited to support of Oracle Corp. and PeopleSoft Inc. applications data. With the technology integration that followed OuterBays October acquisition of BitByBit International came support for other enterprise applications, including IBMs DB2 and Informix data management software, Sybase Inc. databases, Microsoft Corp.s SQL Server, custom code and databases, and all leading hardware platforms. OuterBay officials said that future releases also will support SAP R/3 and Siebel Systems Inc. databases.\nADMs second component, Instance Generator, eliminates full-size production database copies in favor of smaller but relationally intact subsets of the database that provide more efficient test, development, staging and training environments. Instance Generator is the result of OuterBay having integrated BitByBits Subsetter product, which is technology dedicated to the problem of quickly creating appropriate subsets of data.\nLiveArchive improves application performance and reduces the downtime needed for worldwide consolidations and upgrades by managing application data growth, officials said. It works by identifying inactive application data and moving it onto more cost-effective storage, where it remains online and accessible to users from their existing application user interface. This results in a smaller, high-performance production database, OuterBay said. It is a result of OuterBays integration of BitByBits CheckMate archiving technology.\nMichael Howard, chairman and CEO of OuterBay, said that the motivation behind the expansion of the companys data management software is to address the fact that enterprises storage spending is skyrocketing. \"While all application data is not equal, companies typically treat it as though it were,\" said Howard, in a statement. \"As a result, spending on storage continues to skyrocket as enterprises address data growth by accommodating the problem.\"\nAnalysts agree that the management of large databases is becoming an issue, as the size of data stores move from megabytes to gigabytes to terabytes. \"Adding more enterprise-class disk arrays to the problem is becoming less of an option, not just for the added cost of higher-priced storage but also because of the time to back up and restore the data,\" said Carolyn DiCenzo, an analyst at Gartner, in a statement. \"File-level [hierarchical storage management] products are often not a good fit for managing database growth, and, thus, there is a growing interest in products specifically designed to archive database data.\"\nThe ADM suite is priced at approximately $1,000 per gigabyte."}

Click here to subscribe.\nRidgefield substance abuse therapist Liz Jorgensen is shocked that no one has hit the panic button yet over the latest drug abuse trends.\nStatistics indicate prescription drug overdoses are killing nice kids from nice families in well-to-do communities all over the country.\nPrescription drug use in Connecticut now kills more people under the age of 34 than car crashes, Jorgensen said, quoting a national study of figures from 2006 released this year.\nNationwide, 45,000 are killed in car crashes; 39,000 die from prescription drug overdoses, according to the study.\nJorgensen's professional network and private practice indicate an increasing number of teens are dying from the scourge of prescription drugs, particularly opiates that mimic heroin. She said kids do not perceive the addictive danger of these drugs.\nJorgensen said some teens get hooked on heroin when the price of narcotic painkillers gets too high.\nIn recent months, Jorgensen said she has sent 30 of her patients under age 22 to in-patient treatment for opiate abuse. They all started using strong painkillers and then moved toward heroin as a cheaper alternative.\nOne OxyContin pill -- a trademark version of the narcotic painkiller oxycodone -- costs about $80; a gram of cocaine is $50, and heroin is even cheaper at about $10 a bag, area experts said.\nJorgensen and other substance abuse specialists said opiates -- many found in bathroom cabinets and family medicine drawers -- are quite prevalent and accessible. Not only are they addictive, too often they can prove deadly when combined with other medications or alcohol.\nThe much-publicized death of a 17-year-old Newtown High School student, Danielle Jacobsen, just before her graduation ignited renewed concern about these troubling trends, according to area substance abuse specialists.\nThe investigation determined Jacobsen ingested a relatively unknown drug at a party in a Monroe condominium complex and early the next morning was found dead in a nearby pond.\nSoon after news broke about Jacobsen's death, rumors started to circulate about teens who attend \"pharm'' parties, where unknown brands of prescription drugs are offered to guests.\nLocal substance abuse officials and police said they think that is relatively rare. Rather, they said, teens tend to sell or barter prescription drugs raided from family stashes, with some even stealing the drugs or altering medications they are able to buy over the counter.\n\"I don't think this `bowl thing' is exactly what it looks like,'' said Allison Fulton, executive director of the Housatonic Valley Coalition Against Substance Abuse. \"But prescription drugs are out there.\nStudents don't just abuse narcotic painkillers, Fulton said.\nShe said she regularly hears of teens and young adults abusing attention deficit disorder and anti-anxiety drugs, as well as taking over-the-counter cough medications in higher doses than advised.\nCocaine is making a resurgence in some of the wealthier towns, and heroin use is clearly on the rise and readily available, she said.\nFult"}

Total revenues of the company, however, grew by 32.51 percent to 758 crore during the quarter against 572 crore reported during the corresponding quarter of FY'10, he said. For 2010-11, net profit jumped by 64.63 percent to 101.15 crore compared to a net profit of 61.44 crore in FY'10.

Before the child was conceived by artificial insemination with donated sperm, Ms Keaton signed consent forms for Ms Aldridge to undergo the procedure. Ms Keaton stayed with her in hospital after the baby's birth and they shared her home in Sydney's inner west for nine months afterwards. But after arguments about parenting, Ms Aldridge moved out with the child late in 2006.\nMs Keaton sought court orders that she be declared a parent of the child and given equal shared parental responsibility for her.\nThe court found in February that she was not a parent as defined in the relevant legislation, which hinged on the timing of conception. To qualify under the Family Law Act, Ms Keaton had to be the mother's de facto partner at the time of the artificial conception, and the court heard the women only moved in together the month before the child's birth.\nThe Chief Federal Magistrate, John Pascoe, found Ms Keaton was not the mother's de facto partner at the key time. However, he found she was concerned with the girl's care, welfare and development. He ordered Ms Aldridge have sole parental responsibility for the girl but that she also spend time with Ms Keaton.\nMs Aldridge appealed to the full court of the Family Court, arguing the orders were unnecessary because she was the child's only parent.\nThe appeal was dismissed last week. The full court found that the original decision recognised Ms Keaton played ''an important role, akin to a parent, in the child's life for a significant period of months after her birth''.

Users ranked a phone's music and video capability at 7.4 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most important purchase consideration factor, according to the study.\n\"Music is very strategic for the various electronic devices Samsung manufactures,\" said Daren Tsui, CEO and co-founder of streaming music service mSpot, which Samsung bought last year to create the Music Hub service now available on Galaxy smartphones in the United States and Europe.\n\"By owning it, we can absolutely customize the music experience and leverage the fact that it's not just a service but there's also a hardware component.\"\nIn January, Beats Electronics, the startup co-founded by recording supremo Jimmy Iovine and hip-hop performer-producer Dr. Dre, and backed by Universal and Warner Music, announced a new streaming-subscription service dubbed \"Daisy\" to take on Pandora and Spotify starting this summer.\nNow, industry insiders expect Apple, Google and other technology titans to jump into the fray. Apple is talking with music labels about tacking a subscription service option onto iTunes, sources have said, while Google is said to be planning a YouTube subscription music service, according to media reports.\n\"There are some content creators that think they would benefit from a subscription revenue stream in addition to ads, so we're looking at that,\" a YouTube spokesperson said, but declined to comment on any specific negotiations.\nMicrosoft is already promoting its Xbox Music service. Their entry promises to catalyze an industry shake-up and propel music streaming further into the mainstream.\n\"ITunes was great but it needs a step forward,\" Iovine, chairman of Universal Music's Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records, told the AllThingsD conference in February. \"There is an ocean of music out there that people want.\"\nMusic streaming, or playing songs over the Internet, has in recent years begun to come into its own as listeners increasingly choose"}

(AP) \u2014 Erin Hamlin started coming to Lake Placid almost 20 years ago, when someone from USA Luge first figured out that the little girl had some potential on a sled.\nShe would only become the best American singles luger \u2014 that\u2019s the general consensus, anyway \u2014 as well as a world champion, a World Cup winner and an Olympic medalist. On Saturday, the soon-to-be-retired Hamlin competed in a major international race on her home track at Mount Van Hoevenberg for the final time.\nThere were no tears, no long farewell. She was all business , as always.\nHamlin revealed last month, after qualifying for her fourth Olympic team, that this season is her finale. The 31-year-old is getting married next summer, and wants to get on with some semblance of a regular life. She\u2019s still one of the best lugers in the world, even though this season hasn\u2019t brought the results she\u2019s seeking. And when the Pyeongchang Games roll around, Hamlin will certainly be thought of as someone who can find her way to the medal podium again.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why she\u2019s not fixating on the farewell season.\nThere are still some major goals to chase before she packs up the sled for good.\nUSA Luge doesn\u2019t want to lose Hamlin. It also doesn\u2019t want to lose her fan club.\nForget the 23 World Cup medals she\u2019s won, or the two world championship gold medals \u2014 one of them from 2009 at Lake Placid \u2014 or the Olympic bronze from Sochi four winters ago. Hamlin\u2019s career will be remembered for both what she did on the ice and for all people who would make the trip from her tiny home town of Remsen, New York, up to Mount Van Hoevenberg so many times over the years.\nThey are Team Hamlin. They\u2019re not a subtle, quiet group. When they\u2019re at a race, everyone knows.\n\u201cThe atmosphere here is awesome,\u201d Canada\u2019s Alex Gough said, gesturing over to the wildly cheering bunch.\nAnyone driving through Lake Placid this weekend had no choice but to see the dozens of Erin Hamlin signs that were stuck into just about every snowbank along the main roads. An Erin Hamlin banner was adorning the balcony at one of the hotels in town. Her fan base all wore pins and waved flags and cheered for everyone \u2014 not just Hamlin, not just the American sliders either.\nThey are the First Family of luge fandom. They\u2019re adored by all, even the likes of German star Natalie Geisenberger. Medalists in luge races get flowers immediately after the results go final, and it\u2019s not uncommon for Geisenberger to toss her bouquets to the Hamlins in a show of respect that has grown deep over the years.\nThe World Cup season resumes next month after the Christmas break. Hamlin is going to take a few days off from sliding, hoping to come back for the second half recharged for the buildup to Pyeongchang.\nAnd while she acknowledged any Lake Placid race is significant, the farewell tour can wait."}

Microsoft gets social heft, a network of business pros, leads for its business and touch points to every person looking to be productive. LinkedIn is a social network hoping to be more of an human resources software company with no real skills to deliver.\nOn paper, these two companies may just complete each other and equate to Microsoft becoming an human capital management software player on some level. The $26.2 billion bet--and whopping 49.5 percent premium--means that executing on what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella outlined may be tricky.\nWe are in pursuit of a common mission centered on empowering people and organizations. Along with the new growth in our Office 365 commercial and Dynamics businesses this deal is key to our bold ambition to reinvent productivity and business processes. Think about it: How people find jobs, build skills, sell, market and get work done and ultimately find success requires a connected professional world. It requires a vibrant network that brings together a professional's information in LinkedIn's public network with the information in Office 365 and Dynamics. This combination will make it possible for new experiences such as a LinkedIn newsfeed that serves up articles based on the project you are working on and Office suggesting an expert to connect with via LinkedIn to help with a task you're trying to complete. As these experiences get more intelligent and delightful, the LinkedIn and Office 365 engagement will grow. And in turn, new opportunities will be created for monetization through individual and organization subscriptions and targeted advertising.\nNotice what Nadella didn't say. Microsoft wants to be more involved in the human resources application food chain. Nadella did hint at HR hooks strongly with a clear cloud twist. For now, Microsoft is justifying a hefty premium on everything from improving Bing to cloud analytics to using LinkedIn data to improve Office, Dynamics CRM and a host of collaboration tools.\nOn a conference call, Nadella said HCM software was \"a very exciting opportunity for us.\" He added that LinkedIn's economic graph will come in handy for numerous applications.\nIf you look at the combination of Office 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics that's the core of who we are. And then you combine it -- a cloud asset which is a network asset. We aren't just talking about CRM. It is CRM with social selling. It is not just about HCM, it is HCM with talent management telemanagement solutions and recruiting from LinkedIn. Those to me are the formative things that we can now do.\nLinkedIn owns a unique data set. It likely knows where you work, what your job title is and many of the people you know in a professional context. This is a data set that has been missing from traditional CRM, which has historically been an empty database that forces a user to constantly populate themselves. If integrated correctly, this is a huge asset for Microsoft.\nBut don't lose focus on the big enterprise software picture. Microsoft can help LinkedIn achieve what it wanted to do after acquiring Lynda.com, which offers online training courses via video. When LinkedIn acquired Lynda, CEO Jeff Weiner, who will lead the company after the Microsoft deal, talked about completing an economic graph of how people work and interact professionally.

Among the large agencies, Orange County Transportation Authority buses and Metrolink commuter trains both set new records while Foothill Transit buses narrowly missed breaking that agency's previous best from 2003.\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority had 486 million riders in 2008 -- not quite measuring up to the 494 million that the agency notched in fiscal year 2006-07. In July 2007, some fares were increased, and bus ridership fell as a result.\nStill, agency officials were encouraged that rail ridership spiked as gas prices rose last year.\n\"We tended to attract more riders on the rail side when gas was $4.50, and the riders stuck around\" even when gas prices fell, said Marc Littman, an MTA spokesman. \"The rail is more competitive with the auto because it's faster and the fares are still cheap.\"\nOfficials at most agencies are encouraged that even with ridership slipping since last summer's peak gas prices, it was still higher in late 2008 than in late 2007 -- an indication that some riders may have given up their cars for transit.\nThe last time Americans took as many transit rides as they did last year was in 1957. The all-time high for ridership was set in 1946 with 23.5 billion rides.\nRidership then began a long slide through the 1950s and '60s as freeway construction and suburban flight exploded. Ridership bottomed out in 1972 at 6.6 billion and then began to climb as gas prices rose because of the Arab oil embargo.\nOfficials with the transit association wasted little time trumpeting the new numbers Monday. Their hope: persuade the Obama administration to pour much more money into transit as part of a massive federal transportation spending bill that is due to land before Congress later this year.\n\"Now, more than ever, the value of public transportation is evident, and the public has clearly demonstrated that they want and need more public transit services,\" said William Millar, APTA's president, in a statement.\nFinancially, many transit agencies are struggling. OCTA raised fares about 25% in January and cut 50,000 hours of bus service on Monday because of declining sales tax revenue and cuts in state funding by the Legislature. Metrolink is likely to raise fares this summer, and the MTA is also contemplating serious bus service cuts because of the loss of state money.\nMeanwhile, the Bus Riders Union is holding a news conference in Los Angeles today to ask that federal stimulus money be used to purchase new buses, add more bus-only lanes and cut bus fares.\n\"It's a proven way of attracting ridership,\" said Manuel Criollo, a spokesman for the group."}

Plagued by constant criticism of its Ares I crew launch vehicle booster and budgetary-related delays to the whole programme, the decisions by president-elect Barack Obama's government about NASA funding and Constellation are complicated by the Space Shuttle fleet's imminent 2010 retirement.\nBroadly, Obama has the choice of cancelling Constellation and making NASA's mission Planet Earth, potentially ending US human spaceflight after 2010, or making the ISS the focus but ending that in 2015 along with the astronaut programme, or deferring Shuttle retirement and Constellation's Moon return date and turning to the commercial sector for extended ISS operations.\nThe first two choices are bad for the electorally important state of Florida and, with a world depression, Obama's re-election strategy could be to maintain the status quo for NASA and defer any retirements and cancellations beyond the recession. Whatever he does, these choices for the USA have major implications for the ISS partners, including the ESA.\nAfter a year that saw success for ESA with the start of its Columbus ISS laboratory operations and its expendable station resupply vessel, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the agency had set out an ambitious agenda for its member states, linked to the world's space agencies' global exploration strategy.\nHowever, ESA now faces 2009 with less money for human spaceflight activities than it wantedafter its November 2008 member states meeting decided to keep its triennial funding regime on an even keel, but to delay any further leaps for manned exploration. Gone is the idea of an all-ESA or Russian joint venture manned spacecraft programme starting this year.

She has extensive government managerial experience including at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which she helped set up, and at OMB where she manages the financial regulation portfolio, according to her biography.\nBut the success of her confirmation will rest heavily on her performance before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, during which Kraninger will have to answer to progressive Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren.\nThe two lawmakers have said Kraninger lacks experience and last month had demanded she clarify her involvement in Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy that separated more than 2,000 children from their parents.\nOn Tuesday they called unsuccessfully on the committee\u2019s chair, Republican Senator Mike Crapo, to postpone the hearing until they got a response.\n\u201cThere are always some who will say anything in order to create controversy where none exist. She is well qualified to lead the and she will do a great job protecting American consumers,\u201d White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said on Wednesday.\nThe CFPB has been under attack from Republicans who claim the independent agency created by Congress to protect consumers from abusive lenders has over-stepped its legal statute.\nThe agency\u2019s acting head Mick Mulvaney is also the OMB chief and works closely with Kraninger. He took over at the CFPB from Obama-era appointee Richard Cordray in November, and the agency has since dropped cases against payday lenders, shelved proposed regulations and overhauled some units.\nSome Republican Senators including Crapo and Pat Toomey have backed Kraninger\u2019s nomination. But other conservatives have raised concerns that her lack of consumer finance experience will hurt her confirmation chances."}
{"idx": "7760", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Professor Albert Einstein's theory of Relativity has received within the last few months observational verification which would appear to place it on an unassailable foundation.\nThere are three deductions from Einstein's law which can be submitted to experimental tests. These are called the \"crucial phenomena.\" The first of these is the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. According to Einstein's law of gravitation, the major axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet must revolve round the sun, and as Einstein himself points out, \"theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 seconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury.\"\nThis rotation, which finds expression in the movement of the perihelion, or point of the orbit nearest to the sun, has been familiar to astronomers since the middle of last century, when Le Verrier, the famous French mathematician, detected it. He was so puzzled by this outstanding irregularity, unexplained by the old law of gravitation, that for a time he was inclined to believe in the existence of an interior planet between Mercury and the sun. When the Einstein theory was formulated it was recognised that this long-standing puzzle constituted a strong argument in its favour.\nThe second of the crucial phenomena is the deflection of light. \"According to the general theory of relativity,\" Einstein points out, \"a ray of light will experience a curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field, this curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body which is projected through a gravitational field.\" Consequently a ray of light passing close to a heavenly body ought, if Einstein is correct, to be deflected towards that body.\nThe only occasion on which the theory can be tested is during a total eclipse of the sun, when the rays of light from far distant stars have to pass through the strong gravitational field of the sun. The eclipse of 1922 afforded the most decisive evidence. Professor Campbell, director of the Lick Observatory in California, went to Australia and personally superintended the work of the eclipse expedition. On April 12 last Professor Campbell announced that the photographs showed an appreciable deflection in the field surrounding the eclipsed sun. The mean observed value is identical with the actual value of the deflection predicted theoretically by Einstein.\nThe third of the crucial phenomena has proved more elusive. According to Einstein the spectral lines produced by the storms at the surface of a massive body should be slightly displaced towards the red. \"We can,\" he said some years ago, \"regard an atom which is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that it is correct to say that an atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated.\" The displacement is very minute - two-millionths of the wave-length, and the only body in whose spectrum it can be looked for is the sun.\nFor several years careful measurements have been carried out by several investigators, notably Dr. Grebe and Dr. Bachem at Bonn and Dr. St. John in California. Up to a few months ago the evidence was conflicting, for while the German astronomers appeared to have satisfactory confirmation, Dr. St. John was led to a negative conclusion. As Dr. St. John is in command of the finest astronomical instruments in the world, his negative results inspired some confidence. At the recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, however, he announced that he had at last succeeded in detecting the Einstein effect.\nProfessor Einstein stated on one occasion that his theory"}

Greg Abbott, a Republican who signed the bill into law this month.\n\"California may be able to stop their state employees,\" said Abbott spokesman John Wittman, \"but they can\u2019t stop all the businesses that are fleeing over taxation and regulation, and relocating to Texas.\"\nBecerra has the authority to issue such a ban, thanks to a law that went into effect Jan. 1 prohibiting state-funded travel to states that have discriminatory laws on the books. The new law requires the attorney general to keep a list of such discriminatory laws.\nMany people speculated during the 2017 regular legislative session that Texas would be added to the list if it passed a bill setting rules for which bathrooms transgender people can use. That legislation failed during the regular session. Meanwhile, the adoption bill wasn't really on the radar of people concerned about California state travel.\nHB 3859, authored by Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, says that faith-based organizations can also place a child in a religious school; deny referrals for certain contraceptives, drugs or devices; and refuse to contract with other organizations that don't share their religious beliefs. Under the law, if an organization refuses services to children or prospective parents on religious grounds, they will be required to refer the child or parent to a different organization.\nIt was a controversial bill. LGBT groups said it \"used religion as a weapon.\" Religious groups said it allowed them to serve children without violating their core beliefs.\nAlabama, Kentucky and South Dakota were also added to the list of states with California travel bans. It's not immediately clear what the economic impact of the decision will have on Texas.\nOne of the key consequences could involve higher education \u2014 and college sports in particular. Researchers and staff members from universities often travel to Texas for conferences. And California college sports teams play in Texas fairly regularly. Several major sports bowl games and tournaments are played here \u2014 including the men's college basketball Final Four in San Antonio in 2018. The University of California, Los Angeles played a road football game at Texas A&M University last season. The University of California, Berkeley played at the University of Texas at Austin a year earlier.\nThe California law allows for exceptions for contracts that are already in place, and it's unclear whether the state's teams would be banned from playing in the Final Four.

Agriculture markets, especially seeds, flour and milling operations are strong but commodity fumigations of grain ebb and flow with the market. If facilities are storing grain and other products long-term we see greater demand. The food-processing sector has leveled off because of philosophical changes on the client\u2019s end and cost considerations.\nClients are using fumigation more creatively than in the past.

The S&P 500 recovered after gapping lowing at the open yesterday and although the close was not particularly constructive is called to open firmer.\nAsian equities were heavy, though China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippine markets were closed for public holidays. The MSCI Asia-Pacific was off fractionally. After a lower opening, European bourses have turned higher, helped by a positive UK employment report and a unexpected 0.4% rise in the euro area April industrial output. Global bond markets have also stabilized. JGB prices are little changed and the peripheral European bond yields are mostly lower.\nThe yen recorded what looks to be its biggest advance in three years yesterday and those gains have been shaved today. The dollar was pushed to almost JPY95.50 yesterday and buying was seen in Asia and into the European morning before running out of steam near JPY97. News from Japan was mixed.\nOn one hand domestic corporate prices rose, extended its advancing streak to 6th consecutive monthly rise and lifting the year-over-year rate to 0.6%, the highest since Dec 11. On the other hand, machinery orders fell 8.8% in April. The more than expected decline follows the out sized 14.2% increase in March, but recall that the March gain was to offset the 13.1% decline in Jan (Feb was 4.2%). Although the Abe government continues to push for corporate tax cuts to boost investment, Japanese companies have the huge savings, but lack sufficient investment opportunities, at home.\nTh euro extended yesterday's move above $1.33 in early Europe, but ran out of steam abruptly. An important target for many chartists was $1.3340. A break now of yesterday's lows near $1.3330 would call into question the euro's recent uptrend. We share two observations about the euro area industrial production report. First, sentiment and surveys appear to have been weaker than the actual figures.\nWe find this distinction often helpful, but is often obscured in data-surprise models. Second, at his press conference earlier this month, Draghi implied that it would take a worsening of the data for the ECB to deliver another rate cut. The recent data, including the rise in industrial output, suggest no rate cut in Q3.\nUK employment data, showing a larger than expected decline in the claimant count and favorable revisions for the April series and improved earnings data (for April as it is reported with an extra month lag), is consistent with the recent data stream pointing to stronger economic activity here in Q2."}

The systems will be available with Linux and Sun's own Solaris x86 operating system in both 32bit and 64bit flavors. Sun also intends to work with AMD on larger SMP designs in the future.\nDevelopers will have access to the Sun servers by the end of this year. A generally available 64bit version of Solaris x86 will be ready by the middle of next year.\nSun plans to offer its Java Desktop System - a Linux OS - on Opteron workstations. This will serve primarily as an application development system. The company, however, will not comment on when the workstations will arrive.\nSun's CEO Scott McNealy made this announcement at the Comdex trade show, as El Reg first predicted. AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz joined McNealy on stage.\nRuiz's appearance should come as no surprise given the magnitude of this deal for AMD. Up to this point, IBM was the only major server vendor to back Opteron - doing so with a system aimed at high performance computing and little else. Sun's Opteron ambitions appear to stretch much wider with the company talking about rolling out an \"entire line\" of Opteron kit.\nSun has brought AMD into its iForce partner program for testing applications and porting software onto Solaris x86. One of the key partners here is Oracle, which plans to run its database on Opteron systems for both Linux and Solaris. A 64bit version of Oracle for Linux is due out by year end, but the company would not comment on when similar software will be ready for 64bit Solaris x86.\nMerrill Lynch server guru Steve Milunovich was quick to chime in on Sun's news.\n\"Sun might get lucky in that Itanium could prove disappointing,\" he wrote in a research note. \"CEO McNealy has long held it's difficult to introduce a new instruction set into the computing arena. Analyst Joe Osha recently suggested that Intel may emphasize Yamhill, its 32-bit extension processor, over Itanium. If Itanium drops the ball, Opteron is poised to pick it up and run.\"\nThe pressure of being Sun's biggest critic must be getting to \"The Loon.\" Last we checked, Intel had a stranglehold on the 32bit chip market. Most industry experts are looking for the Yamhill extensions to be 64bit, making chips based on the technology competitive against Opteron. But, hey, Miloonovich has an unparalleled reputation in the industry and a heck of a cheerleading outfit collection, so maybe he's onto something the rest of us aren't privy to.\nSun's move toward Opteron gives the company a natural extension to both its workstation and server lines. Sun has seen its share of the workstation market dwindle by sticking with RISC-only systems but now gets one of the top performing x86 chips in the industry.\nOn the server side, Sun is expanding its lines of x86 servers, placing the Opteron boxes alongside its Xeon and Athlon systems.

Employees are drawn to the company\u2019s inclusive environment, quest for innovation, talented colleagues and of course, its competitive pay and benefits packages.\nHusco employees are also inspired by the company\u2019s clear mission and strong corporate values. The company\u2019s expectations of its employees are high: a fanatic focus on customer service, dedication to perfect quality, high personal integrity, and a strong commitment to teamwork. In return, employees become part of high-functioning teams that demand excellence but also prioritize a healthy work-life balance.\nWhile Husco\u2019s business success is exceptional, its the commitment to community service and civic engagement that makes it truly unique. Husco employees are encouraged to take leadership roles in volunteer organizations, and the company has a corporate matching program to support employee contributions. Husco contributes roughly 10% of pretax profits to philanthropy each year. Occasionally, the company contributes significantly more than this, resulting in years like 2016 when Husco donated more to Wisconsin charities than any other business in the state, including large employers like Johnson Controls and Northwestern Mutual. Husco and the Ramirez Family Foundation focus on supporting education initiatives in the United States and around the world, including the recently launched St. Augustine Preparatory Academy on Milwaukee\u2019s south side.\nTogether, Husco\u2019s 1500 employees have earned a top workplace designation for the seventh year in a row. The company is actively recruiting candidates for engineering and operations positions. The top workplace award will help attract candidates who are looking to join a winning team.\nTo find out more about this Top Workplaces winner, visit Husco.com!"}

But the bottleneck for tapping these oil deposits has been the pipelines to get the oil out.\nExisting pipelines either run through Russia or through Iran. With Iran blackballed by an American trade embargo, that leaves all the spigots from the Caspian region in Russian hands.\nBut on Oct. 9, a consortium of oil companies, dominated by the government of Azerbaijan, decided to break that Russian monopoly by extending a second major pipeline to the Mediterranean that skirts Russia entirely.\nThe decision has large financial and even geopolitical stakes. The route of the pipes will be followed by billions of dollars in transit royalties for the countries involved. But it also affects the balance of political power in the region. Russia has powerful leverage over countries such as Kazakstan because it controls the infrastructure for refining and transporting Kazak oil and gas.\nRussia and Turkey, which have rivaled each other for centuries for influence around the Caspian, have been lobbying furiously for the pipeline to be routed through their territory. The United States has strongly backed a two-pipeline scenario.\nThe consortium decided on a two-pipeline solution. It will first use an existing pipeline through southern Russia for the early oil to come out of the Azeri fields in mid-1996. This is touted in Moscow as a diplomatic victory for the Russians.\nBut work will also begin on extending an existing pipe running from Baku, Azerbaijan, to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. The extension will run to Georgia's Black Sea coast near Batumi and will also carry the smaller early production.\nBoth these routes then ship the oil across the Black Sea and through the Bosporus to the Mediterranean.\nBut the bigger stakes are for early next century, when full production reaches an estimated 700,000 barrels per day from the Azeri fields - and possibly some of the far greater output of Kazakstan's Tengiz fields under development by Chevron.\nThe consortium spokesman said Oct. 9 that it favored building this new, larger pipeline through Georgia to Batumi, then south across southeastern Turkey to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.\nTurkey also considers the consortium's decision as a victory.\n''The decision by the consortium is a major success for Turkey,'' said Emre Gonensay, the prime minister's chief adviser, who coordinated Turkey's efforts to achieve the deal.\nr Turkey will get transit fees from the pipeline. This will create jobs - particularly during the construction of the pipeline - and reactivate the port of Ceyhan. Mrs. Ciller also says the economic benefits will allay some of the damage in southeast Turkey caused by the country's ongoing battle with separatist Kurds.\nr Turkey hopes to emerge as a regional power in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Ankara entered the race for the oil routes with the longer-term objective of gaining economic as well as political power in the region.\nTurkey believes that the new arrangement will not only increase Turkey's and the West's influence in the region, but also help Azerbaijan and Georgia to be less dependent"}

Speaking on The Huffington Post's \"What is Working: Solutions to America's Job Crisis\" panel, alongside will.i.am, LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue, Startup America CEO Scott Case, moderator Tom Brokaw, and more, Dawson brought her star power and unique perspective to the Ritz Carlton ballroom in Charlotte, N.C.\nFollowing the panel, Dawson spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the DNC then and now, what's changed since President Barack Obama took Office and why she didn't vote until the 2004 election, despite being eligible in 2000.\nThe Hollywood Reporter: Why was it important for you to be here at this event and at the DNC in general?\nRosario Dawson: I got to go to both the RNC and the DNC four years ago,and I'm bummed that I missed the RNC this year.

It was like a whole other kind of experience. Those two years leading up to that election were so intense. I think there's been a lot of things that have been going on the past four years, and we have seen changes like Don't Ask, Don't Tell and obviously the Iraq War, but also civil liberties being taken apart and immigration issues.

{"idx": "7798", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: I am a classically trained recruiter and this is my confession. Programmed into my brain since starting my career was the idea the unemployed are low hanging fruit, and probably rotten since they were not picked for employment sooner. If I wanted top talent and a hefty bonus at the end of the year, I had better go after the currently employed who are high on the potential list for promotion. Only as a last resort would we consider hiring the unemployed. This was limited to the recently unemployed who were aggressively looking, and who met our criteria for job stability. The rule of thumb was no more than two jobs in five years or three jobs in ten. We eventually discarded this rule since the people who could meet these criteria were becoming extinct.\nStarting in the mid to late 1990s, and due largely to the massive layoffs during that time, employers slowly began to soften their harsh opinions about the long-term unemployed. However, any jobless person with a beat down attitude and desperate personality was off limits. We left those undesirables for our competitors to hire. From our closely guarded point of view, if no one else was willing to hire the misfortunate, why should we.\nSince the start of the current recession in 2007, employers have become increasingly sensitive to the plight of the long-term unemployed. Their awakening is due to the realization millions of jobless are still consumers and they do not want to jeopardize sales by appearing uncaring. Their newfound sensitivity, however, has not translated into hiring the longer term unemployed, discontinuing layoffs or job eliminations.\nThis brings us to 2011, and the government's expectation US employers should play a role in turning the economy around, by creating new jobs. With sufficient tax incentives, employers will create new jobs, but this does not guarantee they will fill those jobs with the long-term unemployed, which now include half of all jobless Americans.\nFor anyone who thinks US employers have outgrown their unfair criticisms of the unemployed, think again. UCLA researchers, Geoffrey Ho and Margaret Shih, recently published a working paper indicating employers are still biased against hiring the jobless. Interviewers assume the unemployed are unqualified, and therefore deserving of their misfortune. This stigma can be so strong it overrides any objective data, suggesting the best qualifications are insignificant if interviewees are jobless.\nThis research confirms two old adages: a) you are better off searching for jobs when you have one, and b) a leopard cannot change its spots. Employers still evaluate recruiters on their ability to attract top talent, which still includes the currently employed, and as a last resort, the short-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed are so far down the totem pole all they are likely to find are the leftovers.\nThere are exceptions. In this case, it would be the most resilient among the long-term unemployed who are still upbeat and able to convince interviewers their misfortune and undesirability are not due to their lack of qualifications. Even among the most hardened recruiters, jobseekers that are resolved to persevere deserve a fighting chance. If for any reason, recruiters expect they will be just as hardy on the job as they have been without a job.\nImprove employer attitudes toward the long-term unemployed.\nIncrease the resilience of the long-term unemployed to persevere when competing for fewer jobs.\nJobseekers are unaccustomed and ill equipped to compete for fewer jobs over an extended"}

As the soldiers turned a corner they were ambushed, sparking a series of firefights that spread across the city and ignited a week of bloody combat. Specialist Morgan and Sergeant Ruthig, both squad automatic gunners, survived this battle, while others soldiers were not as lucky. But subsequent press reports neglected to mention one thing: that both Morgan and Ruthig are women.\nDespite a Department of Defense policy banning women from direct ground combat, U.S. military commanders have been using women as an essential part of their ground operations in Iraq since 2003. The female soldiers who accompany male troops on patrols and house-to-house searches are known as Team Lioness, and have proved to be invaluable. Their presence not only helps calm women and children, but Lioness troops are also able to conduct searches of the women, without violating cultural strictures. Against official policy and without the training given to their male counterparts, and with a firm commitment to serve as needed, these dedicated young women have been drawn into the fighting in some of the most violent counterinsurgency battles in Iraq. Yet they are rarely\u2014if ever\u2014mentioned in news accounts of those battles.\nLIONESS profiles five women who saw action in Iraq\u2019s Sunni Triangle during 2003 and 2004. As members of the U.S. Army\u2019s 1st Engineer Battalion, Shannon Morgan, Rebecca Nava, Kate Pendry Guttormsen, Anastasia Breslow and Ranie Ruthig were sent to Iraq to provide supplies and logistical support to their male colleagues. Not trained for combat duty, the women unexpectedly became involved with fighting in the streets of Ramadi.\nTold through interviews, journal excerpts and archival footage, LIONESS offers a portrait of five soldiers who are also wives, mothers and daughters, and who have long coped with the demands of military life, especially the sacrifices involved in leaving behind spouses and young children. These combat-tested women exemplify what it means to be a good soldier, and illustrate the complicated role that women play in direct war combat. Reflecting on their recent deployment, the Lionesses display strength and candor, bridging the gap between the perception and the reality of the essential role women are playing in Iraq."}

Ideal waters for tubing are rated Class 1 or 2 on the International Scale of River Difficulty, meaning you'll encounter a few straightforward riffles or rapids on a river that otherwise flows smoothly. A 4-mile trip through wildlife-rich forests on the Hocking River begins at Riverside Campground and ends at a natural rock bridge. Hocking Hills Adventures rents tubes on the stretch, as well as provides a shuttle back to the campground. Take a 2- or 5-mile trip on the Mohican River nine miles south of Loudonville with tubes and shuttle provided by Mohican Wilderness. The family-oriented campground has other activities to keep your family busy including horseback riding, bike rentals, miniature golf and archery.\nInflatable kayaks -- also known as \"duckies\" -- combine the best of tubing, kayaking and rafting. The rubberized crafts are suitable for rivers ranging from flat water to Class 3 for skilled paddlers using thigh straps to prevent becoming unexpectedly airborne over large waves. Ohio requires inflatable kayaks be registered before use on the rivers, even if you are from out of state. The Maumee River near Waterville is home to the Million Dollar Wave stretching across the broad river, as well as ledge drops and rooster tails. The large Turkey Foot rapid concludes your journey with a grand finish.\nPractice kayaking maneuvers such as spins, flips and cartwheels on stationary waves known as play waves. A short-bodied, hard-sided kayak designed for river running or freestyle kayaking allows the sharp maneuvering necessary for performing tricks.

Buck Creek Whitewater Project in Springfield is a good place for beginners to learn their moves as the artificial water features are free of debris, undercuts and other hazards found on natural rivers.\nLook for rivers and creeks rated as Class 4 or 5 to challenge whitewater where precise maneuvering and expert skills spell the difference between an exhilarating run and traumatic injury.

The tiny clip, which is placed using a catheter, holds the flaps of the mitral valve together to prevent leaking.\nIn normal hearts, the flaps of the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle come back together after each heartbeat. With mitral regurgitation, the valve does not seal completely and blood leaks back into the left atrium. This reverse flow forces the heart to work harder to circulate the blood and can result in shortness of breath, fainting, low blood pressure, fluid retention, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a hacking cough that worsens when lying down.\nIf left untreated, patients with mitral regurgitation can suffer serious complications.\n\u201cPatients can develop heart rhythm disorders which can cause blood clots and strokes. The heart muscle gets worse and worse function, so by the time symptoms develop, patients have lost critical heart function,\u201d said Dr. Ziyad M. Hijazi, study investigator and director of the Center for Congenital and Structural Heart Disease at Rush.\nThis new procedure is performed under general anesthesia and is far less complex than the standard method of correcting mitral regurgitation \u2013 open heart surgery, which requires a sternum splitting operation, use of a heart-lung machine and stopping the heart to repair or replace the valve.\nWith a small puncture in the groin area of the leg, a catheter is threaded through the leg vein up into the heart. This allows doctors to manipulate a tiny clip, which can bring the mitral leaflets together to help control or cure the mitral regurgitation and stop the leak.\nBecause the procedure is minimally invasive, patients usually spend one night in the hospital compared to about five nights with open heart surgery.\nPreliminary results from the phase I trial, known as EVEREST I, show that the vast majority of mitral regurgitation patients who had successful results with the MitraClip device did not need mitral valve surgery three years after their procedure and many benefited from significantly improved function of the left ventricle. At 36-months follow-up, 82 percent of patients who had a successful result with the MitraClip device remain free from surgery. Seventy-four percent of patients with one or more clips implanted experienced significant improvement in the leak. Also, 12 months after the procedure, the shape of the left ventricle has improved. This was based on five echocardiographic measures, including left ventricular end-systolic dimension.\nFor more information about mitral regurgitation or the EVEREST II REALISM trial, please contact Catherine Glase, clinical research nurse at Rush, at 312-942-9398.\nPatients must be 18 years or older.\nPatients who are good surgical candidates and are open to the option of a less invasive approach.\nHigh-risk patients who are not good candidates for surgery.\nThe EVEREST II (Endovascular Valve Edge-to-edge REpair STudy) clinical research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the MitraClip device compared to traditional surgical mitral valve repair or replacement.

They still do.\nWhether you believe Hell is a literal place or part of an ancient myth, it remains a powerful metaphor and descriptor in our modern language. While some religious people let go of Hell early on in their path to atheism, others hold onto that belief as long as possible.\nThough Christians say that the Bible remains unchanging, their theology on Hell has shifted over the years. In American history alone, Hell has evolved from the literal fire and brimstone of the Puritan era (as evidenced in Jonathan Edwards\u2018 infamous sermon) to what blogger Neil Carter calls \u201cHell 2.0\u201d: the interpretation of C.S.

{"idx": "7810", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: 2010: the Year of the Conservative Woman?\nIn 1992, when the number of women elected to the U.S. Senate soared from two to six, excited pundits dubbed that four-person breakthrough \"The Year of the Woman.\" But it was a one-sided wave. Five of the six female senators in the 100-member Senate were liberal, pro-choice Democrats. Conservative women had long been active in Republican politics, of course, but rarely as officeholders. In those days, conservatism and feminism didn't mix, at least not easily.\nThis season's primary elections suggest that 2010 may become the Year of the Conservative Woman. The GOP's membership in Congress is still mostly male (as is the Democrats', of course, only a little less so). But a new generation of conservative women is running for office and winning Republican nominations, from California on Tuesday ( Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina) to Connecticut last month (Senate candidate Linda McMahon).\nGOP primary voters, a deeply conservative bunch, don't appear to have much of a problem with strong women in public life anymore. Not only that: The GOP is consciously trying to turn gender into a selling point. This isn't just the march of equality; it's a strategy. Republican strategists say female candidates should run well this year, when voters are dissatisfied with incumbents of both parties, because women are, by definition, outsiders; they're not members of the \"old-boys club.\"\nNikki Haley, the likely GOP candidate for governor in South Carolina, highlighted that fact explicitly, telling voters she wasn't part of the state capital's \"frat party.\" Most candidates don't say it so explicitly; they don't have to.\n\"Men are always perceived as being in a back room making deals, and women are perceived as being shut out of the back room,\" says Linda DiVall, a pollster who has worked with the Republican National Committee.\nIn a report she gave Republican leaders last year, DiVall urged them to step up their efforts to recruit women. Conservative female candidates, she said, could appeal to swing voters more successfully than conservative men.\n\"Too often the Republican Party is seen as old, rigid, stern and out of touch,\" DiVall said in her report. \"Recruitment of female candidates, especially from outside government, will help greatly in changing perceptions of the Republican brand.\"\nFor example, she said, when voters are asked which party's candidates are more concerned about \"people like you,\" most normally choose the Democrats. But when the Republican candidate is a woman, that concern gap either narrows or disappears. A female candidate makes the GOP look warmer and friendlier.\nThe women who have been leading the GOP's effort to recruit more female candidates have taken up DiVall's thesis with enthusiasm.\n\"People feel that conservative women are more like them; that they know how to multitask, how to get the homework done in the evening, get the lunches ready for the next morning and have dinner in the oven before they go to work,\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a member of the Republican leadership in the House, told me. \"Voters are looking for people who can get results, who can help the government get better organized.

A true alpha dog, Robinson wins at the catch point with size, length and superior leaping ability.\nRobinson wasn't alone. Complementary receiver Allen Hurns had the league's longest touchdown streak, scoring in seven consecutive games.\nWide receivers coach Jerry Sullivan told NFL Media's Jeff Darlington last November that Hurns' work ethic and toughness compare to Anquan Boldin's. That is lofty praise considering Larry Fitzgerald has cited Boldin as \"the toughest dude I've ever met in my life.\"\nWhile Marqise Lee and Rashad Greene remain questions marks as the third and fourth receivers, versatile tailback T.J. Yeldon showed enough promise as a rookie to draw Le'Veon Bell comparisons.\nIt's a credit to general manager David Caldwell and offensive coordinator Greg Olson that the Jaguars have assembled such a promising young nucleus in the past two years.\nIf this offense is going to join the ranks of the league's elite, they need more consistency at offensive tackle, a breakout season from Lee and a bigger role for tight end Julius Thomas.\nPerhaps most importantly, they need another year of development from Bortles. Already one of the most fun quarterbacks to watch, Bortles must continue to improve his decision making, avoid backbreaking turnovers and gain more accuracy on shorter throws.\nIf all that comes to fruition in 2016, we could end up witnessing the highest-scoring offense in franchise history."}

Jails Initiative\u201d gathered nearly a quarter-million signatures in support of the measure, which would also give the Civilian Oversight Commission a mandate to study reducing the county jail population and reallocating jail construction dollars into alternatives to incarceration.\nSupervisor Sheila Kuehl said more of the county\u2019s 10 million-plus residents should be allowed to weigh in.\nMembers of the coalition behind the ballot initiative include the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, Dignity and Power Now, White People 4 Black Lives, Black Community Clergy and Labor Alliance, Black Lives Matter \u2014 Los Angeles and more than 140 other organizations, according to its backers.\nKuehl, the only board member to offer comment, said she believes the current arrangement, under which the Office of Inspector General acts as the investigative arm of the commission, provides more oversight.\nBut advocates for reform say the watchdog agency needs to be able to investigate deputy misconduct by demanding deputy testimony, records and evidence.\n\u201cThe issue is that this body \u2026 lacks the immediate and real authority to do what they were tasked to do,\u201d said Esther Lim of the ACLU of Southern California.\nIn a letter to the board, the county\u2019s lead lawyer argued subpoena power would be ineffective in gaining access to more information, particularly given passage of Senate Bill 1421, which expands public access to records related to police shootings. Subpoenas for non-public information could be successfully blocked, County Counsel Mary Wickham said.\nBecause the OIG is not subject to the Brown Act, it is able to obtain confidential documents from the Sheriff\u2019s Department and keep them confidential while using them to further investigations on behalf of the commission. The Civilian Oversight Commission cannot hold closed-door meetings.\n\u201cThe OIG believes the current investigative model works well, making the initiative unnecessary,\u201d Wickham said.\nBut advocates and community organizers pointed to continuing deputy misconduct, including sexual assault of female inmates, racial profiling and alleged drug trafficking by deputies, in urging the board to adopt the measure as written.\nSheriff Jim McDonnell, who served on the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Jail Violence before being elected to his post, opposes subpoena power for the watchdog group. McDonnell is up for re-election this November.\nThe \u201cReform L.A. Jails\u201d measure would also authorize the commission to study ways to reduce the county jail population and examine the feasibility of directing funds earmarked for jail construction into mental health treatment, diversion programs, reducing recidivism and other community resources.\nThe county is in the conceptual design phase of work to replace the downtown Men\u2019s Central Jail with a $2.2 billion combination jail-clinic dubbed the Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility.\nCustody officials and members of the board have said the new downtown treatment center is critical to overall justice reform and to complying with various court-monitored settlement agreements aimed at reducing jail violence and preventing inmate suicides because the Men\u2019s Central Jail is aging, decrepit and unsafe.\nOpponents say it will continue to support a law enforcement system that disproportionately jails poor and minority residents"}

{"idx": "7822", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Before choosing a tree to plant, consider the maintenance needs.\nFast-growing trees can be a blessing when you need shade, a bit of privacy or if you need to block an unattractive view of your neighbors. Evergreen trees are a good choice -- they retain their foliage all year so that the view is consistently hidden -- but some deciduous trees also work well as screens. Choose carefully, because not all fast-growing trees make good screening plants.\nIt's tempting to choose trees that grow as quickly as possible, but sometimes the fastest-growing trees are the worst choices. This is because many fast-growing trees grow so quickly that they have invasive roots or weak wood, and they can become riddled with disease or suffer from severe insect pest infestations. Instead, choose a tree that grows relatively quickly but is strong and hardy if you want your screen to last. Trees that have dense foliage and grow about 2 feet per year are a good choice, advises This Old House.\nSome evergreen trees feature needles, and some of these change color during fall and winter. The dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), for example, has long, soft green needles that turn orange in fall. Hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 5 through 10, it can grow to a maximum height and width of 100 and 25 feet respectively, so plant it where it will have plenty of room to spread out. The Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) has bluish-green needles and a pyramidal shape. It grows in USDA zone 4 through 9, the species can grow to 80 feet tall and 40 feet wide, but many cultivars are smaller. Try \"Fastigiata,\" which grows to 50 feet tall and 20 feet wide.\nThe hybrid popular (Populus deltoides x Populus nigra) is that rare tree that grows quickly but is still a good choice for a screen. It grows between 5 and 8 feet per year if conditions are right. It grows in USDA zones 3 through 9, to a maximum average height of 50 feet and width of 30 feet. It's not evergreen, but the leaves turn a glorious gold in the fall. For an evergreen choice, try \"Nellie R. Stevens,\" (Ilex x \"Nellie R. Stevens\") a fast-growing holly tree that camouflages your neighbor's house and brightens up your winter landscape with vibrant red berries. This cultivar grows in USDA zones 6 through 9 and will reach a maximum average height of 30 feet and 12 feet wide.\nDon't be seduced by an extremely fast growth rate or clever marketing, especially if your trees will be near your neighbor's property. Your neighbor might not appreciate trees that soar into the stratosphere or trees that drop debris all over the yard. The Leyland cypress (x Cupressocyparis leylandii), for example, is a poor choice. Although it grows in USDA zones 6 through 10, and soars to the height of a five-story building, it suffers from a host of disease and bug problems, advises Fine Gardening. Another tree to avoid -- according to Fine Gardening -- is the Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra). It grows in USDA zones 3 through 9, and is dense and extremely narrow. The tree shoots up to a height of 100 feet in as little as 20 years, but"}

More recently, one board member said, they were told money might be unaccounted for as far back as 2008.\nAccording to several board members, Fluck\u2019s name was the only one on the committee\u2019s bank account, and he would have been the only person able to make withdrawals.\nFrank Natale, the South Philadelphia High School football coach and athletic director and a member of the game\u2019s board, said he received a call in December from a spokesperson for Ampro, an apparel company in Clifton Heights, informing him that the company hadn\u2019t been paid nearly $10,000 for jerseys it supplied for last year\u2019s all-star game, played May 19 at Northeast High School.

We currently have a prepayment system. As far as I am aware, they have paid $30 million, which means we will supply gas paid for with this money,\u201d Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said on Saturday.\nGazprom also insists that gas supplied to the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine should be paid by Kiev\u2019s Naftogaz superstructure in accordance with the contract.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that new debts are mounting regarding supplies to southeastern Ukraine. There are two ways to settle. It could be an extrajudicial settlement between two commercial companies making reciprocal payments. Or we\u2019re going to the court,\u201d said Novak, as cited by RIA Novosti.\nFormer Ukrainian PM and acting MP Yulia Tymoshenko has suggested Naftogaz be abolished, as it is said to be the major source of corruption in Ukraine\u2019s gas producing and transporting industries.\nTymoshenko also urged investigation into questionable financial schemes used in the national gas industry.\nAfter Kiev accumulated a massive debt exceeding $5 billion in 2014, Gazprom switched Ukraine to a prepayment system for gas supplies starting in June 2014.\nIn return, Kiev\u2019s Naftogaz initiated a claim in the Stockholm arbitration court, claiming billions in excess have been paid to Gazprom over the years.\nThe Russian energy giant answered with a lawsuit against Naftogaz through the same court, demanding recovery of debt exceeding $5 billion. The first hearing took place this week.\nThe debt initiated a six-month interruption in Russian gas supplies to Ukraine in 2014. To cope with the winter, the EU brokered an interim Gazprom-Naftogaz deal in October 2014.\nAfter this agreement expired last Tuesday, Gazprom agreed to sell gas to Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz for $248 per 1,000 cubic meters, significantly undercutting the $329 Ukraine paid Russia in the first quarter of 2015.\nA new meeting to thrash out gas supply and transit issues between Moscow, Kiev and Brussels will take place before the end of April, though neither a date nor a location for the meeting has been specified yet, said Novak.\nAs of April 1, gas prices for private households in Ukraine have risen by a staggering 285 percent, in compliance with an agreement between Kiev and the International Monetary Fund.

{"idx": "7839", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent.\nWhile the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar.\nThat's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.\nThis all came to mind the other evening as a result of spending time with a group of senior sustainability professionals in major corporations, and socially responsible investment managers at the 20th birthday dinner in London of BSR, America's largest sustainability membership organisation.\nWhile there was talk of progress being made on the corporate front, the conversation kept coming back to the failure of the financial markets to understand the need for change.\nIt was, quite frankly, shocking to hear from the big companies present that at a time of increasingly pessimistic news about climate change and biodiversity loss, never mind a host of other challenges, that mainstream analysts still aren't asking a single question about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues at company briefings.\nHow can this possibly be? The obvious answer is that they still don't believe, or don't want to believe that there is a business case for putting sustainability at the heart of business strategy.\nOn the surface this is strange, given the fact that the chief executives of a growing number of companies, who are looking 10-20 years ahead, absolutely understand the need to transform their business models. There is also plenty of emerging evidence that companies that are taking this seriously are over time outperforming their competitors.\nInvestors are supposed to take a rational approach, and the science is very clear about the scale of the dangers just around the corner, which will have a dramatic impact on all businesses. In the last week alone, we've had three reports, from the World Bank, UNEP and the International Energy Agency, warning we are heading towards catastrophic temperature rises. A couple of weeks ago, PricewaterhouseCoopers warned companies to start preparing for 4C or even 6C warming.\nThe failure of the financial sector to act in a meaningful way presents the greatest block to global progress. New emerging green technologies need capital if they are to reach scale and we need to choke off funds for fossil fuel-based infrastructure projects.\nBoards are also far less likely to invest in sustainability initiatives if their efforts do not get reflected in the share price. The failure so far of analysts to build ESG into company valuations is something that Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, the world's third largest DIY chain, has been particularly vocal about.\nWorse, investors are only too quick to savage directors for taking their eye off the ball if their sustainability strategies are accompanied by a blip in short-term profits growth.\nUnilever chief executive Paul Polman has so far, thankfully, avoided this fate but how many City players are hoping he trips up so they can get back at him for breaking ranks by refusing to give quarterly guidance on financial performance.\nPeter Bakker, who heads up the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, recognises the dangers. He told me recently: \"The valuation of a business has to change \u2026 If the capital markets measured the sustainability of companies then people like Paul Polman at Unilever would be seen as a god.\"\nSo if it's so clear that the my"}

His debut film, Bottle Rocket (1996), starring his goofily charming friends the Wilson brothers, won him early cult status. Rushmore was built on a witty and distinctive voice, and Anderson's visual brilliance came into sharp focus with The Royal Tenenbaums, an elaborately wrapped present to a generation that wanted its own J.D. Salinger, one without the hermit-like lifestyle and creepy Joyce Maynard baggage.\nBut Anderson proved easy to fall out of love with as well, as his subsequent movies became bogged down by a tendency to revisit the same themes \u0097 broken families in need of healing \u0097 and control issues that were outsize even for a filmmaker. With The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou there was the sense of being sucked into a rabbit hole dug by Anderson, and by the cloying The Darjeeling Limited, his self-indulgence had swollen to the point where the hole was too claustrophobic for any but his most devoted fans to bear.\nOne would think then, that a trip with him down an actual hole, albeit one dug by a family of foxes, might be pure torture. But Anderson's stop-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox is both a delightful amusement and a distillation of the filmmaker's essential playfulness. It's not quite tongue-in-cheek but very self-aware, in a good way. \"Why yes,\" Anderson seems to be telling us. \"I do like to play with dollhouses. And look what I can do with them. See the way Mr. Fox's fur stirs in the nonexistent breeze, isn't that marvelous?\"\nIt is, even if it's different from Roald Dahl's children's story about a fox clever enough to outwit three mean farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean, one fat, one short, one lean (no one can say that just once). Dahl's spirit is there, but the cinematic Fantastic Mr. Fox comes fortified with Andersonian pouting, parental issues, self doubt and philosophical conundrums. \"Who am I, Kylie?\" Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) muses to the sidekick Anderson has created for him, an opossum voiced by Wally Wolodarksy \u0097 then clarifies: \"I'm saying this as an existential question.\"\nThe question arises because Mr. Fox, who it must be noted wears slightly too tight, too short suits made of corduroy or tweed, just like his director, is feeling stymied. In a prologue, set two years before our story begins (that's 12 fox years), Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), announces she's pregnant and forces him to give up fowl thievery for a safer profession. Now he's a newspaper columnist (which hardly qualifies as safer), but he longs to return to the hunt, specifically to Boggis, Bunce and Bean's farms, all of which are laid out in glorious, tempting symmetry just across from the front door of the Fox's \"finest quality indigenous\" old-growth tree house.\nDahl's Mr. Fox is cocky and clever, although maybe not as clever as he makes himself out to be. Anderson's Mr. Fox is the same, but more so. He's like a mid-career tribute to Clooney: bold, charming but"}

{"idx": "7853", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Facebook's virtual reality (VR) arm Oculus is joining forces with Chinese device maker Xiaomi to build a standalone VR headset targeted exclusively toward the Chinese market, Oculus announced at CES.\nThe new device, dubbed Mi VR Standalone, is an all-in-one headset, meaning it doesn't need to be tethered to a computer or paired with a smartphone to power the VR experience. Stand-alone VR headsets make VR technology more accessible for the average consumer, as they don't require additional hardware to use the technology, effectively lowering the barrier to entry for broader adoption of VR. Facebook and Xiaomi are also teaming up on the upcoming Oculus Go stand-alone headset, which is expected to be released globally in 2018 at a price point of $199.\nXiaomi's brand recognition in its home market will drive awareness of the Oculus platform. Facebook was blocked in China in 2009 and consequently only has a small footprint in the region, while Xiaomi is the country's fourth-largest smartphone brand. The Mi VR Standalone will support both the Oculus Mobile SDK and the Mi VR SDK.Already, Xiaomi is teaming up with existing Oculus developers to localize leading content from the Oculus Store so developers can bring it to the Mi VR Store in China.\nVia the partnership, Facebook will be in compliance with some of China's strict regulations. China often requires foreign companies to forge partnerships with Chinese firms in order to push their products in its domestic market. Since Facebook and its family of apps are blocked in China, partnering with Xiaomi could help Oculus secure a position in China's VR market.\nChina is the fastest-growing VR market globally, making it attractive to companies. VR headsets shipments in China increased 87% last year to hit 1.1 million units, according to IDC. For context, VR headset shipments in the US grew just 11%. HTC Vive Vice President Raymond Pao highlighted this sentiment, explaining how China is where VR is likely to gain mass adoption first.\nBut China's VR market also has a robust and fragmented VR ecosystem in place already, which could make it challenging to gain footing in. There are currently over 400 VR headset manufacturers in China, and numerous different app stores, APIs, and accessories. This fragmented market makes it difficult for VR developers to create content accessible across the VR landscape. The expected low entry price of the new Mi VR Standalone device, along with the ability for developers worldwide to easily push out new VR content into the Mi VR store for the Chinese market, could ease the fragmentation in China's VR market.\nFacebook could propagate Oculus as a globally dominant VR platform by winning over the Chinese market with the help of Xiaomi if it can stave off competition on the higher end and convert China's lower-end VR user segment. HTC is launching a $600 stand-alone VR headset exclusively in China in January that could win the higher end of the market.\nOn the lower end, there's a massive market in place for cheap mobile VR headsets in China; Alibaba-owned online marketplace T-Mall said the majority of the 300,000 mobile VR headsets purchased on the site cost less than 30 yuan (USD $4.40).

Wade.\" He went further, saying not only would he like to put Roe v. Wade into law, but he&apos;d \"like to incorporate it into the constitution.\"\nThe law has come under fire by devout Catholics and religious leaders, who call it draconian and inhumane. Some Catholic leaders have called on Cuomo to be excommunicated for championing the law.\nNew York Archbishop Timothy Dolan -- who doesn&apos;t think Cuomo should be excommunicated over a political decision -- rebuked the Democratic governor from a purely human rights perspective, especially for publicly celebrating a law the New York City cardinal told \"Fox & Friends\" is \"ghoulish, grisly, and gruesome.\"\nLast week, Cuomo framed his decision as giving New York women \"the fundamental right to control their own body.\"\nIn a back and forth between the governor and the Catholic church, Cuomo went after the church for pushback against passing the Child Victims Act. He said he&apos;s with Pope Francis, but Dolan insists Cuomo is taking quotes out of context.\nMorris said excommunication is still an option but doesn\u2019t seem like it would be helpful or effective."}

{"idx": "7861", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The integration-software innovator delivered another impressive quarter, along with a surprise long-term outlook.\nOf all the initial public offerings of 2017, MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE) may be the most intriguing. The company's Anypoint Platform allows users to link disparate applications, databases, and other sources of information into composable applications programming interfaces (APIs), which greatly speeds up innovation and is a vast improvement over traditional manual integration services. Anypoint seems to be a really useful platform for a growing list of large companies, and MuleSoft has a first-mover advantage as the inventor of the application network.\nThe market has been excited as well, giving the company a very high 13.5 price-to-sales ratio. Last quarter marked a continuation of the impressive numbers MuleSoft has been putting up all year in the wake of its March 2017 IPO: Revenue grew 60.3% to $88.7 million, beating analyst expectations, and the company's guidance for the upcoming quarter was $82 million to $84 million, well ahead of analyst estimates of $78.5 million. Still, the 17% surge in MuleSoft's stock was likely due to the longer-term outlook management decided to give investors to wrap up its first year as a public company.\nWhile many companies give guidance for the upcoming quarter or even the upcoming full year, MuleSoft management went further, giving investors a longer-term revenue target of $1 billion in 2021. That's a significant increase over the past year's $296 million and would amount to an annualized growth rate of 35.5% over four years.\nThat's strong and sustained growth and the fact that management thought it could project that far out signals confidence in the company's large market opportunity, as well as its ability to generate customer wins over potential challengers. Management may be so confident in reaching its target because it claims to operate in a huge addressable market of $27 billion for integration software, and $443 billion for integration services.\nMuleSoft's strong adoption has been largely related to new enterprise use cases, such as omnichannel retail, the Internet of Things, and other solutions that require agile integration of resources across the modern enterprise. However, management also noted that as companies become more familiar with its technology, MuleSoft is beginning to be called upon to replace legacy point-to-point integrations that were manually stitched together using previous, less-sophisticated techniques.\nAs the pioneer of the Anypoint platform, MuleSoft is thought to be well ahead of competitors in this API-based application network service and has invested heavily to retain that lead. It has increased its number of employees from 841 to 1,140 over the past year, and more than doubled research and development investments from $8.7 million to $18 million in the fourth quarter.\nUnderstanding the importance of recruiting top talent in a competitive tech world, management was keen to point out the company's recent honor as the top midsized company to work for by the Bay Area News Group for five consecutive years, as well as similar employee-related honors from The San Francisco Business Times, Silicon Valley Business Journal, and other publications in the U.K., Argentina, and Australia.\nWhile some may point out the company's lack of profitability and the fact that last quarter's net loss per share of $0.12 only met analyst expectations, the loss was mostly due to higher commissions, which came as a result of the quarter's robust sales,"}

It looks the part; nothing flashy going on here, just an elegant design that should stand the test of time. The sound, however, is something new.\nThe British-made A7 is 37 inches (nearly 1 meter) high, the front baffle is fitted with a 1 inch (22mm) polyamide tweeter and a 7 inch (178mm) polymer woofer. At first I thought the A7 was a sealed (acoustic suspension) design, but a closer look revealed a rectangular bass port just below the speaker cable connectors. The A7's internal cables are silver plated copper, the crossover features high linearity capacitors, and the speaker's impedance is rated at 8 ohms. The handsome black ash, dark walnut, or natural oak real wood finishes are commensurate with the A7's price: $4,995 in the US, \u00a33,200 in the UK, and AU$5,999 in Australia (per pair).\nI partnered the A7s with a Bryston B135.3 integrated amp and Bryston BCD-3 CD player, and played LPs on a Dr. Feickert Volare turntable for all of my listening tests at the Sound by Singer store in NYC. Straight away the music was unerringly precise and clear; there's no blurring or muddiness going on here! It's very British, but with stepped-up clarity.\nNo baby boomer audiophile would mistake the A7 for the polite British sound of years past, the A7s immediacy came to the fore with Paul Simon's recent In The Blue Light album, There's an unforced purity to the sound that puts the music first on these old Simon tunes, spiffed up with wonderful new arrangements. Simon's vocals are upfront and very present, though a little thin, but this recording sounds like that. The A7 tells it like it is.\nOn jazz guitarist Bill Frisell and bassist Thomas Morgan's Small Town duets album, the sound balance warmed up nicely, especially on Morgan's dexterous bass fingerings. There's nice weight down there, and Frisell's airy, almost ambient guitar floated free of the speakers. I really felt the connection between the two improvising players.\nFor comparison listening tests I used a pair of Harbeth M 30.2 stand mount speakers ($6,995/\u00a33,895/AU$6,950 per pair), and the sound took a sharp turn to fuller and richer than the A7's.

Rather than withdraw, as she\u2019d seen other Muslim women do, she turned her anger into a program that is now working with young Muslim women to teach them self-defense while encouraging them to become leaders and role models for others in their communities.

The empowerment lessons can be as simple as showing the young women how to rent or reserve a room in a community center to tips on becoming a confident public speaker.\nAbdelhamid said her efforts have not been universally well received by the Muslim community. \u201cWe have had some challenges and pushback from more traditionalist members of our community who don\u2019t necessarily see space for women in leadership, unfortunately,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really disheartening because you want your allies to be within the community.\u201d The program has grown since the first class was offered to about a dozen girls in the basement of a community center in Brooklyn.\nThe basic program, called Mentee Muslimah (an Arabic word for Muslim women), is a 13-session summer camp attended in New York by about 50 young women of high-school age that follows a 100-page course outline Abdelhamid developed during an independent study course at Middlebury. The organization relies heavily on donated space and volunteers, but it\u2019s also received donations and in some cases fees are charged to people taking the program to help defray expenses. She\u2019s in the process of setting up a formal non-profit group so WISE can have a permanent home and a budget.\nAbdelhamid sometimes travels to lead programs outside New York, but most are led by people who have taken the program and then been trained to teach it.

Winemaker Anne-Laure Helfrich, whose father launched the Helfrich family winery (focusing on Alsatian whites), was up for the task.\nTwo generations as a winemaking family in that part of the world still counts as \"Now Open\" when you've got families like the Trimbachs who have been making Alsatian wines for nearly 400 years. Which means this young winemaker has been racking up a lot of airline miles recently, popping bottles for sommeliers and such who may not have tasted the family's wines.\nSquid Ink asked the 23-year-old winemaker to tell us which Alsatian wines she's drinking right now, other than her own. Of course, she included those anyway. But hey, if we were making wine, we'd be drinking it, too (Helfrich's $10 Noble Pinot Gris is the wine she drinks most often when she's cooking at home with her boyfriend). The rules we gave Helfrich were simply that the wines be a good value for the quality (not hard with Alsatian wines, as there are plenty of bargain options) and that they be available in the U.S. (trickier, as many great bargain Alsatian wines are not exported). You can find many at the local retailers below, or ask your wine shop to order them for you. Get Helfrich's picks after the jump.\nNote: Prices vary depending on vintage.\nI like this winegrower for their innovation: The family, like mine, belongs to the \"Alsatian Renaissance.\" They make a modern, stylish Sylvaner with mineral and white fruits flavors, deliciously spicy with ginger notes.\nI couldn't speak about Alsatian wine without mentioning Trimbach, which is a reference point for many generations of Alsatians for Riesling. The style is very typical of the vineyards from Ribeauvill\u00e9, traditional, dry and mineral.\nThe grapes are grown in the Bollenberg vineyards in the south of Alsace [Orschwihr]. Their Riesling has a lively nose, with nice floral and mineral notes, which become elegant and robust.\nI love the sweetness of this Gew\u00fcrztraminer. In Humbrecht wines we [winemakers] recognize the work of winemaker Olivier Humbrecht with the delicacy of the wine.\nI like Deiss for the originality and complexity of their wines -- especially the Muscat, with fresh and crispy flavors of lime and pink grapefruit."}

{"idx": "7872", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: All this, combined with talk about a possible summit, seems to hold out promise for a better US-Soviet climate. But it is too soon to know what it means in practical terms. There is no doubt Mr. Andropov has immense problems, especially economic ones, and would welcome a decrease in tensions with the United States so that he can get on with solving them. It should also be said that he is shrewdly playing on growing public fears in the West about the nuclear buildup and is seeking to project the image of a peacemaker. This effort has gone so far as to take advantage of a letter from 10-year-old Samantha Smith of Manchester, Maine, asking him why he wanted to conquer the world. Mr. Andropov wrote back that the Soviet Union sought peace with all its neighbors.\nPresident Reagan, for his part, certainly does not wish to let Mr. Andropov run away with the propaganda battle or to be outdone as an advocate of peace and arms control. Under mounting pressure from the nuclear freeze movement at home and in Europe, and under lingering criticism from Congress on his MX plan, Mr. Reagan now appears to be shaping his own image as a peace candidate in the 1984 election. Not irrelevantly, perhaps, the President's chief political adviser speaking before a group of Republican women at the weekend warned of the ''gender gap'' that could endanger Mr. Reagan's reelection. Inasmuch as the peace issue is one on which polls show that a growing number of American women feel strongly, Mr. Reagan is impelled to respond positively to it - and to Mr. Andropov.\nThe question to be asked is how to translate the latest exchange of more or less kindly words into something concrete. The public should not be fooled into expecting that relations could go back to the ''intimacy'' which Mr. Andropov says prevailed during World War II, when the two nations were allies against a mutual enemy. The public should also not think that it is possible in the near future to have the kind of close, genial state-to-state relationship which exists among the Western allies, bound by common values and systems of government. There will be an adversarial relationship with the Soviet Union as long as its system, its values, and its outlook are inimical to those of the West.\nBut that should not rule out a normal, even cooperative relationship - one based on a balanced assessment of each other's military strengths, an appreciation of each other's security concerns, and a civil if not friendly posture. In this connection, the appointment of a high-level US diplomat - Jack Matlock, now ambassador to Czechoslovakia - as senior specialist on Soviet affairs in the President's National Security Council is a positive step. This will provide Mr. Reagan with the kind of firsthand experience in and knowledge about the Soviet Union which have been lacking in the White House and should help to bring clarity to American policy on East-West relations.\nIn sum, the public can be encouraged to see Moscow and Washington stepping back from strident rhetoric, which only aggravates tension. The need, however, will be for the leaders to follow through with progress on the issues which have slipped so noticeably in recent years - trade, cultural exchanges, arms control. Above all, arms control. Mr. Andropov crucially needs the stability which an arms agreement would give him. And President Reagan, now that he has persuaded his country of the need to rebuild its defenses - and to commit more resources to it - is in a favorable position to negotiate with vigor. Will he seize the opportunity?\nHe will answer the yearnings"}

Pogba plays a similar key role in midfield for United, creating 11 chances for his team-mates so far although he has yet to record an assist.\nLiverpool have yet to keep a clean sheet in the league this season but goalkeeper Karius is expected to keep his place, despite Simon Mignolet pressing hard to reclaim the No. 1 spot. The big test for Karius is to keep the world-class Ibrahimovic, United's top scorer this term with six goals in all competitions, quiet.\nNew boy Mane's dynamic and speedy forward play has brought a sense of excitement and optimism to Liverpool, with three goals and three assists. He will be up against a top-class goalkeeper in de Gea, who is remembered at Anfield last season for making crucial saves either side of the halves before Wayne Rooney scored the winner in a 1-0 victory.\nCoutinho was impressive for Liverpool in their last league game as they came from behind to beat Swansea 2-1. The Brazilian maestro will be key as he can find pockets of space to spread panic in defences. His brilliant solo goal in the Europa League against the Red Devils is still fresh in the memories of both sets of supporters. But it will not be easy against Bailly, who has been rock solid in the heart of United's defence, picking up multiple Man-of-the-Match awards since his move from Villarreal in the summer.\nThis is the first time the two big-personality managers face off as the managers of Liverpool and United. They clashed on five previous occasions (four times for Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid and once for Liverpool vs Chelsea) with Klopp winning thrice and drawing once. The German's high-pressing style of play will be a threat to United, who have had slow build-ups to their game this campaign.

Cashe asked if there was a possibility he could be paroled, causing some in the courtroom to laugh. Florida abolished parole in 1983, meaning Cashe will spend the rest of his life in prison, barring a pardon or successful appeal.\nAmong the wounded in Cashe\u2019s shooting spree were Herring\u2019s father, Bertis Herring, and 7-year-old Brendon.

{"idx": "7883", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: February is the doldrums. The holiday season is over. Spring seems a lifetime away. So when psychoanalyst David Dorenbaum phoned and said, in a voice that sounded like Peter Lorre with a Spanish accent, that he thought his consulting room \"worked,\" I was intrigued. Would a room that was good for his patients not be good for us all?\nThe model that all psychoanalysts confront when putting together their consulting room is the original: Sigmund Freud's Vienna study. This turn-of-the-century home work space had the buttoned leather couch positioned along the wall just so, the psychoanalyst's chair placed in its particular relationship to that couch. In Freud's study, the walls were lined with books, the floors covered with Persian carpets, the shelves ladened with objects from antiquity. His furnishings suggested the breadth of his intellectual wealth and material success.\nDorenbaum's consulting room is not at home, but it is in what was a second-floor bedroom of a converted Victorian mansion on Toronto's Spadina Circle. Its domestic origin is evident in the panelled door and transom, the ceiling moulding, window trim and exposed radiator. The homey vernacular makes the room feel familiar to patients.\nDorenbaum decided against Freud's densely burdened aesthetic. His has no flotsam and jetsam, no framed degrees or certificates. Not one thing is without what Dorenbaum calls \"signification.\" There is a small clock, because \"time's up\" is part of the structure of the session. It would be too unsettling to enter into free association without knowing it was contained by a defined time span. A small African carving recalls shamans and psychics, hints of cultures that understand the mind in non-scientific ways.\nThe window covering is not just a window covering. The translucent vinyl blind that lets in a filtered light and a vague picture of the world outside is like a veil. A veil, Dorenbaum says, represents memory. And memory is the Holy Grail of psychoanalysis. \"In analysis, nothing is ever clear. The veil doesn't obliterate. It focuses our gaze. It lets us see the shades of an object and find what is meaningful in life.\"\nThe artwork, which includes Adam and Eve by Mexican artist and friend Jose Luis Cuevas, is hung low, so it can be seen to advantage by the person reclining on the chaise. The images are representational, but their subject matter is vague enough to be engaging. Says Dorenbaum, \"They require effort to be revealed.\"\nThere is no ceiling light shining down into the patient's eyes. A 1950s floor lamp, bought for $20, directs light upward, giving the ceiling a soft glow. It is no coincidence that the lamp is best viewed from below. The green metal shade is perforated with rows of tiny holes that provide a pleasant focal point. The lamp sits on three toes like a stork's, animating the ordinary.\nThe \"couch\" reveals Dorenbaum's penchant for 20th-century design.

They are lost in the days and weeks after.\nThe first few days, the biggest worries are clots and infection. They closed the incision with staples rather than stitching it up because they needed to be able to quickly open him back up in case of emergency. If a clot forms in the veins or artery where the weird connections in the plumbing have been made, it will cut off the blood flow to the new liver and, unless the team can remove it right away, the organ will be lost. Or a clot can break off and travel to another organ and mess stuff up. Clots are bad news - and pretty common with transplant.\nInfection is, of course, another big huge risk.\nLater in the first week is when they start looking for signs of rejection.\nAnd Pip, of course, went through a major surgery with lungs that were half-filled with fluid.\nSo, when the surgeon and Pip's hepatologist and the GI attending all came out to the waiting room to tell me that the surgery went well, they were reserved. I said I kinda wanted to hug them. His surgeon said,\"No. Not now. You can hug me when he's released.\"\nI was told that his recovery would be a roller coaster. I was told that cautious optimism was all that was allowed at that point.\nSo, Pip and I cautiously and optimistically moved into our room in the PICU - one of the rooms right at the entrance near the double doors they would use if he needed to be rushed back to the OR. He was in a crib in the center of the room attached to a maze of wires and plastic tubing. I was in my green leather chair that converted into a cot in the far right-hand corner.

There\u2019s peas and carrots, peanut butter and jelly, and the old classic- death and taxes. Of course in America at present, that last combo seems reserved just for us poors.\nOne combo that didn\u2019t seem a match made in heaven was Mercedes and Mopar. It totally wasn\u2019t for want of trying. Daimler AG tried to leverage their Mercedes knowhow in the running of Chrysler and its subsidiaries, but the marriage didn\u2019t stick. It\u2019s almost as if there was some unimaginably wide gulf between one of the world\u2019s greatest auto marques and Chrysler.\nThe fall out of the short corporate coupling included cars like yesterday\u2019s 2005 Chrysler Crossfire SRT-6, which was mostly Mercedes under its retro-fashion skirts.

That Crossfire wasn\u2019t perfect, and in the estimation of 68-percent of you, that meant it wasn\u2019t worth its $12,999 asking.

This 1977 Chevy Blazer Chalet is one of only about 1,800 built over the course of the \u201976 and \u201977 model years.

The most important thing to know about this camper is that its name is pronounced shal-lay like in the potato chips, and not shal-let like in toilet. That\u2019s wholly appropriate since, while this camper does offer a stove, fridge, banquette, and other comforts of home, it does not provide a place for you to drop a deuce. That name, Chalet, comes from the French and sounds very urbane as a result. The even more rare GMC Jimmy edition took a more southern approach for its moniker, using the Spanish \u201cCasa Grande.\u201d That\u2019s pretty odd for something that doesn\u2019t have a crapper.\nThe camper portion of the truck is a fiberglass shell with an extendable \u201cpop-top\u201d roof. That slides into the Blazer\u2019s bed like any pickup-based unit. The difference here is that the front of the camper portion is open and it slides into the gaping maw of the Blazer\u2019s bed which is also open. That creates a pass-thru from cab to camper, expanding the usable space.\nThis one comes with a 400 cubic inch gasoline V8 and a THM350 three-speed automatic. Connected to that is a two-speed NP203 transfer case that sends power to both front and rear axles.\nThe two-tone truck on top of all that is dirty, rusty, and missing at least one headlight, giving it a zombie apocalypse vibe, just from the wrong side of the action."}

But those annual tax rate reductions would take effect only if yearly revenues grow by at least $100 million over the state's highest general revenue point in the previous three years.\nLegislative researchers estimate the eventual cost of the tax cut legislation at $692 million annually. The nonprofit Missouri Budget Project, which analyzes fiscal issues and opposes the income-tax cut, estimates the eventual cost at $817 million annually. The gap stems from different assumptions about what sort of earnings would qualify for the business income tax deduction.\nUnder either estimate, the legislation amounts to \u201ca budget busting tax reform plan\u201d that is unlikely to make Missouri a desired economic destination, said Rep. Jon Carpenter, D- Kansas City.\nMissouri Republicans said their plan isn't as aggressive as the one that took effect this year in Kansas, which kicked in quickly instead of gradually and included no provisions to guard against revenue shortfalls. The Kansas measure reduced income taxes, increased standard deductions and exempted the owners of 191,000 partnerships, sole proprietorships and other businesses from income taxes. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, now is pushing legislators to cancel a scheduled sales tax cut in order to avoid budget shortfalls over the next five years that he says could necessitate cuts to higher education funding.\nAlthough much of its benefit is aimed at businesses, Missouri's tax-cut plan also includes provisions aiding lower-income residents. The legislation would increase an existing $2,100 personal deduction on income taxes by $1,000 for individuals who earn less than $20,000 of adjusted gross income.\nOther sections of the legislation are intended to generate revenues. One provision tightens the wording in Missouri's current tax laws with the intent of requiring more out-of-state businesses and online retailer to pay Missouri taxes on items bought by Missouri residents. Another section would enroll Missouri in a multi-state compact through which online retailers voluntary collect taxes on sales to residents in those states.\nThe bill also includes a tax amnesty offer meant to entice delinquent taxpayers to finally pay up. Those who pay overdue taxes between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 would not be assessed penalties or interest, so long as they abide by Missouri's tax laws for next eight years.

Meanwhile, the populist policies implemented in some countries have caused their economic system to fail, in particular the policies of Venezuela.\nPunyapon notes that three political parties \u2013 Democrat, Pheu Thai and Phalang Pracharat \u2013 can expect to win the overwhelming majority of votes in the poll. These parties are in the mainstream of Thai politics, and will together send the largest proportion of representatives to the House Representatives, and any one of them could emerge as the key government player. And so, their economic policies deserve serious consideration.\nPunyapon said the Democrat Party is this election focused on policies intended to solve the problem of poverty. In particular, they aim to raise the productivity of agriculture through the Blue Title Deed Project in order to access funding sources to ensure water is available year-round so farmers could raise productivity. This could result in addressing a major pain point for Thai farmers. Similarly to the farmers\u2019 income insurance, it could be proved effective and continued. However, it is interesting to consider that GDP indicators are not the only useful indicators. Other assessments could be used to reduce the gaps and disparities including environmental factors, public health, and others. This point is interesting for helping to prepare the country for success in the modern world.\nMeanwhile, Pheu Thai Party, the Democrat\u2019s main competitor, also has had both positive and negative outstanding economic performances, including the rice-pledging policy of the Yingluck government. In the latest election race, the party\u2019s policies are quite interesting, said Punyapon, especially those focused on strengthening Thai SMEs, which have been the largest domestic business component driving the real economy for a long time. The interest point with Pheu Thai\u2019s economic platform is the proposal to create a \u201cfinance company\u201d in every province to expand the opportunities for SMEs, and others who want to do business, to access funding sources. The opportunity could be expanded to help launch careers and build incomes across the country.\nPhalang Pracharat Party is perhaps best know in this election for having General Prayut as its sole candidate for Prime Minister. The interesting point with their economic platform is that they have adopted the policies that were outlined in the 20-year national strategy. It is likely to continue to run the country much as it has performed in recent years, as a sort of Lego jigsaw-style extension, said Punyapon. Their interesting point is to upgrade the skills of 5 million producers through creating \u201csmart\u201d SMEs, 1 million smart farmers, 1 million startups, and 1 million makers and community retailers.\nThe concern is whether or not the programme could truly be \u201csmart\u201d, said Punyapon. The current database, which should be created and used to support entrepreneurs to store data, is not working properly. Cleaning and organising the Big Data to be used could take many years. What should not be done, says Punyapon, is to focus too much on startups, and there is a need to admit that Thailand remains distant from its goal of creating the unicorn startups that have succeeded in some other countries. Real success and serious action has yet to be seen regarding the agricultural policy 4.0 that was implemented under the junta regime. That"}

The question raised by Pfizer's disturbing move to acquire AstraZeneca is whether there is any \"efficient\" British governance at all in matters of industrial policy.\nMPs put all the obvious questions to Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, yesterday \u2013 about jobs, R&D and how much tax the whole manoeuvre would save. They received sketchy answers and reassurances falling well short of guarantees. Later, the same committee heard from Vince Cable, the business secretary, on a fiscally motivated takeover, about which he clearly has misgivings. He took the threat to employment and science \"extremely seriously\", he said. But when it came to the crunch \u2013 whether he was ultimately willing to halt the deal \u2013 he muttered meekly that it was \"tricky\".\nThe case against a Pfizer takeover is easy to make: the American giant is no careful owner. It's a firm that, in the industry parlance, \"buys in growth\". It does so by snapping up rivals, adopting their new drugs, while slashing payrolls and research budgets. That's the US firm's record in three major acquisitions over 14 years. British scientists who have seen the fallout at Pennsylvania's Wyeth (bought in 2009) are among the most vociferous in arguing against AstraZeneca going the same way. And if AstraZeneca goes, runs the thought, in a few years GSK could be the next target.\nThen there is the bigger industrial picture. The pharmaceutical sector is one in which a yawning gap separates laboratory research on the one hand and profitable products on the other. The wonder material graphene \u2013 a lightweight conductor 200 times stronger than steel \u2013 was discovered by scientists in Manchester, and yet the thousand-plus registered patents harnessing it in China, America and South Korea are matched by only a few dozen in Britain. Discoveries will grow into marketable designs only if nurtured by an ecology, which includes not only universities but very often state subsidies too, and supply chains with mutually reinforcing links. Sympathetic local management that grasps how these pieces fit together is a major help here too.\nMr Cable is operating with powers drafted at a time when, away from the political fringe, there was no challenge to the dogma that financial markets could be left to settle company ownership for the common good. New Labour rightly distilled the lesson that there can be advantages to being open to international investment \u2013 think of Toyota's expanding Derbyshire plant \u2013 but wrongly leapt to the conclusion that the state's only duty in policing takeovers was to safeguard competition. As Kraft gobbled up Cadbury, mouthing worthless promises about jobs on the way, there was a belated recognition that citizens could sometimes reasonably expect the state to take a view. Promise-breaking corporations are supposed to be deterred by the threat of a \"cold shoulder\", a bar on City institutions doing business with buyers who break their word. Purchasers can now also be asked to give binding undertakings, theoretically enforceable through the courts.

The Ricoh Women's British Open is going to give the ladies the sternest test imaginable, which was not to Bernard Darwin's liking. \"There seemed to be rather too many holes of one type, with greens running up to a point at the base of a hill and having heathery banks on either hand. They have grown a little intermingled in my head which may be my heads fault, but so be it.\" ESPN2 has the coverage starting Thursday.\n3. Royal Liverpool, or Hoylake as the Open Championship host is properly referred to, has historically required a stout defense from golf writers because so much of its brilliance falls under the guise of nuance. \"At Hoylake the golfing pilgrim is emphatically on classic ground,\" Darwin wrote. \"As he steps out of the train that has brought him from Liverpool, he will gaze with awe-struck eyes upon surroundings in which the irreverent might see nothing out of the ordinary.\" ESPN's coverage starts bright and early July 17th.\n4. Royal Porthcawl hosts the Senior British Open and ESPN2 will show it starting July 24th. Safe to say, Tom Watson will be favored to win at the youthful age of 64 on a links few of today's players have seen. But Darwin noted this is a \"genuine\" links, \"the sea in sight all of the time, and the most noble bunkers. True to its national character, the course also boasts of stone walls.\""}

Only 48 per cent gave that nod to Obama. Moreover, the July 10-13 poll indicated that 72 per cent think McCain has a better knowledge of world affairs, compared to 56 per cent for Obama.\nThat, in a nutshell, is the reason for the Obama tour. He and his handlers think zipping through Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East and Europe with a bevy of journalists \u2014 including the anchors for three major networks \u2014 will polish the presumptive Democratic candidate\u2019s image as a worldly-wise leader and, thus, allow Obama to diffuse McCain\u2019s potent claim that the man is all image without substance.\nIt\u2019s a risky business. If the American public finds images of Obama strutting the world\u2019s stage appealing, then, maybe, he\u2019ll overcome the most serious weakness to his presidential bid \u2014 his lack of experience. But commentators also point out that there\u2019s considerable potential downside to the tour \u2014 committing a gaffe that would confirm the perception of inexperience; appearing presumptuous (a would-be president can\u2019t act too presidential without seeming arrogant); and reinforcing the view that the tour is little more than a series of photo ops.\nThe Obama team has already committed one gaffe. Initially they wanted the candidate to give a speech at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate, near where John Kennedy made his famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech, and close to where Ronald Reagan challenged the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall. The idea, of course, was a symbolic passing of the torch, conferring on Obama the mantle of world-changing leadership.\nThe tour needed to be more substantive, more committed to Obama\u2019s ideas about American foreign policy under his watch, something more than a backdrop to his ambitions. The United States remains the world\u2019s sole superpower, and, ready or not, Obama may soon command its awesome military. It has worldwide interests and is largely responsible for maintaining the geo-political stability of the world; there\u2019s no way an American president can avoid the using that military might in the Hobbesian world of international competition and conflict.\nPerhaps Europeans need to ask why Americans remain skeptical of Obama\u2019s charismatic appeal."}

{"idx": "7917", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This document chronicles a pilot in 2017. Please visit rad.npr.org for updated information.\nThis proposal outlines a draft specification for a custom ID3 tag, referred to below as a Remote Audio Data (RAD) tag. The RAD tag can be encoded with listening event metadata to allow clients to report valuable listening data to podcast content producers and sponsors.\nNPR tested this concept in 2017 within the NPR One app, both Android and iOS. The spec below is intended to be a baseline, with a formal implementation dependent upon industry feedback.\nIf you would like to ask questions or offer feedback to NPR on RAD, please use this form.\nIn the spring of 2017, NPR tested the RAD method of adding a custom ID3 tag to selected audio files to encode supplemental listening event metadata for podcast episodes.\nFor the scope of our pilot, NPR tested approximately 20 mp4 episodes of How I Built This and TED Radio Hour. The ID3 tags were encoded by hand and NPR One served as the test client. A server was set up to receive the listening events, which were then available for downloaded by Splunk, our tool for custom listening analytics. Due to the limited sample size, capturing conclusive listening data for these episodes was out of scope for this initial pilot.\nThis pilot was intended to provide a proof of concept for the technical implementation of the RAD method, to determine both the required level of effort, as well as the accuracy of the captured data. To measure the accuracy, we analyzed the RAD reported events against the reported listening data that we receive from NPR One.\nComparing the RAD event data against baseline NPR One data did include certain complexities; the pilot used mp4 files because that is the majority of listening within NPR One for these podcasts, however there was a subset of mp3 and HLS listening that we could not include.\nPodcast completion rates from the RAD events aligned with NPR One events.\nSponsorship funnels (the drop off from ad break 1 to ad break 2, and so on) and advertisement completion rates behaved as expected.\nFor testing purposes, a custom Remote Audio Data (RAD) tag was created and JSON containing the specified metadata was encoded directly into the custom tag within the ID3 tag. The NPR One client was programmed to parse the metadata when the encoded audio file was downloaded, and an observer was implemented to watch for listening events and then construct a URL to send the event data to a remote server for tracking purposes.

{"idx": "7918", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Tonight, in my estimation, President Obama delivered a brilliant, spellbinding, and fitting speech about the Tucson shootings. This was the best speech I\u2019ve ever heard him give.\nIt can be divided into three parts \u2013 a tribute to the victims, a denunciation of attempts to use the incident to make partisan attacks, and a related call for more civility in politics. In making these points, Obama steered away from what is too often Topic A in his speeches \u2013 Barack Obama. I heard very little of the first person during most of this speech. That is one reason why I liked it so much and one of the reasons I think it will play very well for Obama.\nThe discussion of the victims was just about perfect. This kind of stuff is \u201cmeat and drink\u201d for any first rate politician with good speechwriters. However, it\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone doing better with the material than Obama did. With the telling detail and light touches of humor, Obama brought the victims to life without ever becoming mawkish. Their friends and families were no doubt lifted, which is the most legitimate function of a gathering like this.\nThe second portion of the speech was Obama\u2019s answer to those who have used the shooting to attack their political enemies. This was Obama taking the high road.\nThe decision to take that road seems like a no-brainer. Here was the perfect opportunity for Obama simultaneously to \u201ctriangulate\u201d (he didn\u2019t call out the left by name, but a turned-off public knew whom he meant) and sound presidential. But Obama has passed up or fluffed such opportunities at times in the past.\nHe did not fluff this one. Rather, he perfectly articulated the distinction between proper political arguments based on the attacks \u2013 e.g., arguments in favor of policies that might (or might not) make such attacks less likely in the future \u2013 and shameless attempts to blame the shootings on one\u2019s political enemies.\nObama\u2019s call for civility may bother some, but I don\u2019t think it should. Again, Obama got it just right \u2013 insufficiently civil discourse had nothing to do with these shootings, but greater civility would be desirable nonetheless, and a fitting tribute to the nine-year old victim who was becoming so engaged in American politics. Obama\u2019s call for a politics closer to what this little girl imagined our politics to be was pretty compelling rhetoric.\nUnfortunately, this is probably all it was. Calls for more civility in our politics are, as I have suggested, a bit like calls for better weather.\nIf the tone of our politics is going to change, the change will have to start at the top. You can\u2019t have \u201ccivil\u201d politics if the U.S. president is constantly taking cheap shots and employing overly harsh rhetoric. Obama, with his lack of graciousness towards his predecessor, his references to \u201cenemies,\u201d and so forth has set a poor tone indeed.\nIf he really has been moved by this tragedy to turn over a new leaf, then his speech will prove to be more than \u201cmere words.\u201d And Obama will be the beneficiary, because most Americans yearn for a more civil brand of politics.\nBut let\u2019s not hold our breath. What we saw tonight was a terrific speech, not a conversion."}

At the time, the famed singer-songwriter was in search of inner peace which led him to the Islamic faith in 1977. He subsequently abandoned fame and fortune in order to further his spiritual quest.\nThe British-born musician, of Greek heritage, changed his name to Yusuf Islam and immersed himself into religious faith. But the flame never died for the songs Cat Stevens shared with the world. His lyrics were about freedom, love, and peace\u2026ideals that are timeless.\nOn September 19, Yusuf/Cat Stevens returned to Manhattan, appearing at the Beacon Theatre. It was the first of two New York City concerts and part of a 50th anniversary tour titled \u201cA Cat\u2019s Attic\u201d which debuted in Toronto, Canada on September 12.\nThe sold out concerts revealed the strong desire fans had to welcome the performer back to New York. Yusuf opened with \u201cWhere Do the Children Play?\u201d, a song about our fast paced, over-developed world which is timelier than ever since it first appeared in 1970. He followed with \u201cIf You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\u201d, an endearing anthem of individuality and personal choice. Both these tunes have remained relevant and were also prominently featured in Hal Ashby\u2019s 1971 anti-establishment film, Harold and Maude.\nYusuf is a master storyteller and his current show reflects this. It\u2019s a musical chronicle of his life including stage sets which recreate his modest London home where he grew up. His parents owned a small caf\u00e9 and this provided the youngster\u2019s first job as he dreamed of becoming an illustrator and cartoonist.\nYusuf also mentioned his early inspiration from crooners such as Nat King Cole and Broadway musicals. Sharing his enthusiasm for composers Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, he surprised the audience with a version of \u201cSomewhere\u201d from West Side Story.\nYusuf gave his fans what they wanted\u2026familiar tunes and poignant reflections of his life and career. The performer told the audience he experienced a serious bout of tuberculosis in 1969 which initiated his spiritual path.\nHis songwriting reflected this after his illness with introspective pieces such as \u201cKatmandu\u201d, \u201cMiles from Nowhere\u201d, and \u201cOn the Road to Find Out\u201d. These selections were played on stage along with well-known hits \u201cMoonshadow\u201d, \u201cOh Very Young\u201d, and the emotional \u201cSad Lisa\u201d performed by Yusuf on piano.\nThe singer explained how he brought social conscience into his music. He included an early hit, \u201cMatthew and Son\u201d, from his first album in 1967. This song concerns a working-class man named Matthew who constantly labors only to make his boss wealthy.\nThe crowd awaited in anticipation as Yusuf introduced the classic, \u201cFather and Son.\u201d Featured on the 1970 album Tea for the Tillerman, he told how the song was actually written for a never-produced musical project (\u201cRevolussia\u201d) about the 1917 Russian Revolution.

Several of those are considered too high a security risk for transfer to another country, and a major obstacle barring the facility\u2019s closing has been 2010 legislation blocking the transfer of prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo to the United States.\nMcCain\u2019s proposed measure, which would be part of the forthcoming Defense Authorization Act, would strengthen restrictions on transferring detainees abroad, but in exchange would also give the White House the opportunity to submit a plan for the facility\u2019s closure. If Congress approved that plan, the White House could begin ordering the transfer of detainees from Guant\u00e1namo to the United States for trial or imprisonment.\nThat\u2019s a big if. McCain\u2019s fellow Republicans may be willing to defend his honor from Donald Trump, but that doesn\u2019t mean they share the former POW\u2019s views on U.S. detention policy. A competing House version of the measure includes only the new restrictions on transfers to other countries, which would ban the transfer of detainees to conflict zones like Afghanistan and require the secretary of defense to certify that the countries where they\u2019re headed could maintain control over them. And the leading GOP candidates are generally in favor of keeping Gitmo open.\nAs I wrote in January, despite the fact that the controversy and expense of Guant\u00e1namo outweigh its military benefits, return of the base to Cuba is a nonstarter for the moment. For one thing, Obama will already have his hands full in his remaining months trying to make sure his Cuba moves aren\u2019t immediately reversible by his successor and, if McCain has his way, dealing with the unfinished business of closing the detention center.\nAssuming McCain\u2019s gambit doesn\u2019t work\u2014and it seems like a long shot\u2014the White House plan is to reduce the number of detainees to the point that keeping it open is hard for even Republicans to do.

Soviet officials are expressing the concern that the affair may be used by the US to back away from an agreement on medium-range nuclear missiles.\nMoscow seems to be planning a two-track response: a tough line on espionage coupled with a softer line on missiles. The Soviet Foreign Ministry yesterday held an exhibit of bugs allegedly found in Soviet diplomatic installations in the US; and Soviet officials hint that Mikhail Gorbachev will make new arms control proposals today during a major policy speech in Prague, where he is now visiting.\nThe Soviet Union is eager to obtain at least one substantial arms control agreement before Ronald Reagan leaves office.

One Soviet military analyst said yesterday that Western Europe was ``zigzagging'' over medium-range missiles. A commentary in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda yesterday equated the uproar in the US over the Marine case - in which three marines have been charged with spying, two of them after allegedly being seduced by Soviet women - to other incidents during recent years that had allegedly been blown out of proportion by Reagan administration hard-liners to forestall movement toward arms control. Once again, the commentary stopped short of identifying President Reagan himself as a hard-liner.\nYesterday's display of alleged US eavesdropping devices was another example of the present leadership's combative approach to propaganda: If attacked, it tends to respond in kind.\nBoris Pyadishev, a Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman, stressed that Moscow was presenting solid evidence of US eavesdropping in the Soviets' US missions. The US so far had made only allegations, he said.\nThe Soviet display included photographs and actual examples of bugs allegedly found in the new Soviet Embassy complex in Washington, the embassy's country residence, its consulate general in San Francisco, and living accommodations in the UN mission in New York. Some of the devices removed from the new Soviet Embassy building in Washington had been found ``literally in the last few days,'' Mr. Miroshkin said.\nThe bugs had been planted behind wood and concrete walls and in insulation around windows, the Soviets said; the main television antenna of one apartment block had allegedly been turned into a transmitting device for eavesdropping.

At one time Robinson's cooked with wood--and at one time, I'd venture to say, their barbecue was pretty damn good. Alas, those days, like Royko, are gone. Product as they are of a rotisserie cooker that drafts bare wisps of smoke from outside the main chamber across the meat, it would take a keen sense of smell to detect smoke in these ribs--that is, until you add \"natural smoke flavor\" provided by liquid-smoke-enhanced barbecue sauce. The baby backs have a slightly crisp exterior they acquire from a few moments under a high-powered commercial broiler; this lends some flavor, but the interior meat verges on dry. Chicken fared slightly better--there was no discernible smoke flavor, but the meat was moist and the skin crisp. Hot links were positively flavor packed by comparison, with noticeable red pepper and herbs, but the six-inch sausage suffered from being held and reheated, resulting in a wrinkled, shriveled effect that was particularly disconcerting. Still, by Chicago standards, Robinson's is a pretty good barbecue joint, with crisp, greaseless onion rings in its favor, fresh corn on the cob, and owners who haven't succumbed to the steam/bake/boil school of barbecue meat Jell-O."}

The caption also incorrectly stated Garza is a fifth-year human biology and society student. In fact, he is a second-year political science student.\nThis post was updated Oct. 2 at 2:36 p.m.\nA noncredit course at UCLA will educate students on various components of a perhaps misrepresented drug: cannabis.\nCannabis 101 is a course offered by the student-run UCLA Cannaclub, a club that focuses on educating UCLA students on the various facets of marijuana. The class, available to all interested students, will meet every other Wednesday fall quarter, covering a range of topics related to cannabis, such as the biology of the plant and responsible usage. Students who attend will have the opportunity to learn more about the increasingly conspicuous drug, the stigma around it and how to make connections in the lucrative cannabis industry. Arazoo Shwany, a fifth-year human biology and society student and the education director of the club, said it is particularly important that the club succeeds in creating real dialogue involving more than just conversations about recreational use.\nThe lectures will be delivered by an expert in the particular topic being presented, and students will be encouraged to ask questions following the presentation. Attendance will be taken at each of the classes, and for those who consistently attend, Shwany said, Cannaclub will send their information to various cannabis-related startups and companies it has built relationships with, such as Medicinal Genomics and Los Angeles\u2019 Department of Cannabis Regulation. Students will then have the opportunity to contact companies, offering them a bridge into the industry and allowing them to apply the information they have learned.\nThe club and the courses are centered around two major goals, said Eugenio Castro Garza, a second-year political science student and Cannaclub\u2019s director. One goal is to provide a network for students to get involved in within the skyrocketing cannabis industry, Garza said. Much of the industry is made up of young professionals ranging from lawyers to salespeople, and UCLA students are at a particular advantage given their proximity to LA, the epicenter of the industry, he said.\nA second goal is to disseminate important and relevant information regarding cannabis in an effort to promote education about the often-misunderstood drug, Garza said. He said popular culture portrays marijuana as a drug that induces laziness and lack of motivation, and while there are certain truthful components to this representation, there is more to the drug that is important for students to understand, such as responsible usage and state, national and international policies and regulations. Garza said he hopes the course will allow students to thoroughly understand the drug, its benefits and its pitfalls.\nJeffrey Chen, the executive director of the UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative, said removing the stigma surrounding many aspects of cannabis through education and opening up dialogue about potential benefits and harmful effects are cornerstones of the course.\nCannaclub has its eyes set on an exciting future, Garza said. For the long term, Garza said the club hopes the course will eventually be a catalog course offering credit to students. Garza said he feels there is a void of education in the multidisciplinary study of cannabis, and while other universities like UC Irvine and UC San Diego are offering official courses in the subject, UCLA is falling behind, especially since LA is a major hub in the legal marijuana marketplace.

{"idx": "7938", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Things weren't supposed to go down like this.\nWhen the Huskies opened the season as the No. 6 team in the country, they looked like a squad primed for a run to the College Football Playoff. All the pieces were there \u2013 a veteran quarterback and running back, a talented and disciplined defensive unit and a savvy head coach.\nHell, the Dawgs even had a week one matchup with No. 9 Auburn to make the whole CFB world aware of their presence.\nEven after losing that one, their playoff hopes weren't dashed. Sure, losing your season opener was rough. But the Huskies played a close game in front of what was, for all intents and purposes, a home crowd for the Tigers. Besides, they'd have a chance to beat ranked conference opponents later on.\nFast forward to now, and it seems like everything that could've gone wrong for Washington did. Stanford and Auburn each dropped two straight games and fell out of the rankings. BYU, who were No. 20 when the Huskies beat them, did the same. Suddenly, the Huskies had both a positive win and forgivable loss wiped out, and lost what would've been a chance for another ranked win.\nNone of that, however, compares to what happened on Saturday.\nAfter beating their hated rivals in green and yellow by a combined score of 108-24 over the last two years, the Huskies couldn't get it done in Eugene on Saturday. Even though they only lost by three, it's tough to find much of a silver lining for the Dawgs.\nThings got off to a bad start, with senior quarterback Jake Browning tossing an interception on the Huskies' second play from scrimmage. The vaunted Washington defense held the Ducks to a field goal however, and the teams settled into a back-and-forth that would last for the rest of the game. The balance was a far cry from the annihilations both fanbases had grown accustomed to, making for easily the most competitive game the series had seen in some time.\nWashington's defense was able to contain Oregon's star tandem of quarterback Justin Herbert and wide receiver Dillon Mitchell for much of the first half but wasn't able to keep the shutdown going: Mitchell finished the game with eight catches for 119 yards and a touchdown.\nFor the Husky offense, Browning struggled to find his go-to guys in Ty Jones and Aaron Fuller, but had success targeting tight end Drew Sample. The rushing attack generated 196 yards and a pair of scores.\nMuch of the pain of the loss has to stem from what can only be described as poor late-game decision making from Petersen.\nWith the game knotted up at 24 and five minutes to play, the Huskies started driving from their own eight. The running game kicked in, and Browning went 4/4 while leading his team down to the Oregon 20 with 40 seconds left and a pair of timeouts.\nRather than letting his offense continue to work, Petersen allowed the clock to tick down to three seconds before calling time and sending his kicker \u2013 redshirt freshman Peyton Henry \u2013 onto the field to go win the game.\nOregon head coach Mario Cristobal iced him twice, and Henry missed the 37-yarder wide right to send the game into overtime.\nBrowning got the Huskies down to Oregon's three-yard line on the first OT possession, but the drive stalled out and the team had to"}

Among them is perhaps the finest film of 2014, a batch of festival favorites (mostly from this year\u2019s Cannes), and one of the year\u2019s biggest undertakings.\nAs one can see by the matinees, it was difficult to pare down to 10, as respectable, but ultimately underwhelming dramas such as Miss Julie and A Most Violent Year failed to make the the cut; we also couldn\u2019t find a place for The Interview, which we\u2019re hoping makes for some much-needed Oscar-bait relief come Christmas.\nLastly, it should be noted that a great number of films listed below won\u2019t be immediately available everywhere, but will receive a staggered release continuing into next month, so return for updates. Check out the list below and let us know what you\u2019re most looking forward to.\nSynopsis: A chronicle of the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who was taken prisoner by Japanese forces during World War II.\nWhy You Should See It: Angelina Jolie\u2019s sophomore effort has barely been seen yet, but early word is on the positive, if reserved, side. While it seems tailor-made for the awards season, we hope there\u2019s more to be experienced under the surface, particularly due to the Coens\u2018 involvement in scripting and Roger Deakins guiding the cinematography. It\u2019s also seemingly the perfect stage for Jack O\u2019Connell to showcase his talents to the world, after impressing in independent dramas such as Starred Up and \u201971.\nSynopsis: The defiant leader Moses rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.\nWhy You Should See It: Despite how one may feel about Ridley Scott\u2018s latest films, there\u2019s usually something interesting going on, whether it be on the visual side (Prometheus) or thanks to the script (The Counselor). His most recent feature, a retelling of the Moses story, looks to likely fall in the former category, as it\u2019s his biggest production yet. Early reviews have been far from overwhelmingly positive, but here\u2019s hoping Scott and company have found a reason to revisit the Biblical epic.\nSynopsis: Saoirse is a child who is the last of the selkies, women in Irish and Scottish legends who transform from seals into people. She escapes from her grandmother\u2019s home to journey to the sea and free fairy creatures trapped in the modern world.\nSynopsis: The story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s historic struggle to secure voting rights for all people \u2013 a dangerous and terrifying campaign that culminated with the epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and led to President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nWhy You Should See It: Ava DuVernay\u2018s first studio feature premiered to ecstatic praise at AFI Fest last month, and itlooks to be the final must-see wide release of the year. The first preview sold an incredibly tense drama with gorgeous photography from Bradford Young (who\u2019s reteaming with DuVernay after their indie break-out Middle of Nowhere).

Prices decreased by 0.1 percent in June compared with the same period of 2013, when the month-on-month comparison saw growth slow from May\u2019s 0.2 percent to June\u2019s 0.1 percent, the Slovak Statistics Office reported on July 14.\nAccording to Kozub, this is why inflation in the eurozone is around 0.5 percent, based primarily on Eurostat estimates.\nIn June 2014, compared with June 2013, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages and of postal and telecom services decreased by 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Prices in the sectors of education and miscellaneous goods and services increased year-on-year by 3.4 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.\nFojt\u00edk specified that the drop in the crisis year of 2009, when food prices decreased by almost 6 percent, was especially significant. He pointed to the history, showing that times when food prices decreased were mostly short-term and followed by a steep increase.\nFojt\u00edk ascribes the moderate m/m price level increase to new summer collections of clothes and footwear, which have brought higher prices, up by 0.9 percent. The hike in enrolment fees for university studies increased the price of education by 0.6 percent m/m. Prices of food and beverages and recreation and culture decreased equally by 0.1 percent on a monthly basis.\nAndrej Arady, analyst with V\u00daB Banka, specified in his memo that food consumption makes up roughly one sixth of total household consumption. As food prices decreased m/m by 0.1 percent, they slowed June\u2019s total increase of consumer prices.\nThus, in Arady\u2019s opinion, it seems that private consumption has revived considerably, which has created space for gradual growth in the demand-driven portion of inflation.\nIn this category, prices grew 0.2 percent m/m, which was reflected in the growth of the y/y growth dynamics from May\u2019s 0.3 percent to June\u2019s 0.6 percent. Net inflation shifted away from its minimum in March and April and amounted to 0.1 percent in June, and was at 0.6 percent in June compared with June 2013.\nTatra Banka expects price levels in the coming months to be close to last year\u2019s.\n\u201cThe first indicators of a very moderate increase of prices can be expected during the final quarter of this year at the earliest,\u201d said Fojt\u00edk.\nThe National Bank of Slovakia forecasts that inflation this year should be only just above zero.\nAfter Slovakia\u2019s historically lowest inflation in 2010, which was 1 percent, under the influence of a steep weakening in demand during the crisis, the country returned to faster price growth. In 2011, the headline inflation was 3.9 percent and in 2012 it was 3.6 percent. But in 2013, the growth of prices decelerated again, especially due to weak consumer demand, which resulted in average inflation at 1.4 percent."}

If the case is put forward, the judge will then make a ruling on the case.\nIn a statement released this afternoon, Third Energy said: \u201cIt is in the interests of both the local community and Third Energy that a decision is reached quickly.

Should the ruling go against the council, then Third Energy\u2019s planning application would have be re-heard by the council.\nThirsk and Malton MP Kevin Hollinrake said he stands by his belief that shale gas drilling sites should be located at least a mile from homes and schools but that it made \u201clittle sense\u201d to move the controversial test site at Kirby Misperton.\nDespite its proximity to homes in Ryedale - a distance of 300 metres to the nearest house - the recently approved test site lies within an existing gas field that operators Third Energy have run for more than 20 years.\nThe Conservative MP was targeted by campaigners from Frack Free Ryedale outside his constituency surgery on Saturday. They presented the politician with a \u2018fracking bribe\u2019 cheque and new research that links health complaints with proximity to fracking sites in Pennsylvania, USA.\nMr Hollinrake, who self-funded a five-day trip to Pennsylvania last year to research the impact of the fracking industry on communities there, said he had met with US health professionals who did raise health concerns, particularly about air quality.\nMr Hollinrake said: \u201cThat\u2019s why I have been pressing for independent monitoring of air, water and seismic activity, which is now being carried out by British Geological Survey.\nThe Government proposes to make payments to communities affected by fracking when local fracking operations become profitable; an offer which campaigners claim constitutes bribery.\nBut Mr Hollinrake said the Treasury payments, plus investment packages for communities that the fracking industry had committed to, could see communities benefit from \u201chundreds of millions of pounds\u201d over a 20-year period."}

Authorities say more than 120 people remain hospitalized for smoke inhalation and burns, with dozens of them in critical condition.\nThe blaze began at around 2:30 am local time, during a performance by Gurizada Fandangueira, a country music band that had made the use of pyrotechnics a trademark of their shows.\nPolice have said the club&apos;s ceiling was covered with an insulating foam made from a combustible material that appeared to have ignited after it came in contact with a spark from a flare lit during the performance.\nAfter the fire extinguisher malfunctioned, the blaze spread throughout the packed club at lightning speed, emitting a thick, toxic smoke. Because Kiss apparently had neither an alarm nor a sprinkler system and only one working exit, the crowd was left to search desperately for a way out.\nAbout 50 of the victims were found in the club&apos;s two bathrooms, where the blinding smoke caused them to believe the doors were exits.\nPolice investigator Arigony said people headed to the bathrooms because the only lights in the dark club were coming from there, and the patrons mistook them for exits.\n\"There were diverse irregularities,\" he said. \"Any child could have seen that this establishment should not have been open.\"\nOutraged locals marched through Santa Maria Tuesday to demand justice for the dead, an unusual move in a country where public protests are rare. The demonstration interrupted the police news conference, even as Arigony pledged to investigate everyone involved in the tragedy -- including the authorities charged with making sure such establishments are up to code, such as firefighters and city officials.\nThe fire inspired nationwide action, and several mayors said they would crack down on nightclubs and other venues in their cities.\nThe government of the country&apos;s biggest city, Sao Paulo, promised tougher security regulations for nightclubs and other places where many people gather. Since the fire, a Rio de Janeiro consumer complaint hotline has received more than 60 calls denouncing hazardous conditions at night spots, theaters, supermarkets, schools, hospitals and shopping malls around the state.

By the late 1800s, the slow-moving Chicago River had become a cesspool of sewage and factory pollution oozing into Lake Michigan, the source of drinking water for the bustling metropolis.\nThe waterway had grown so putrid that it raised fears of a disease outbreak and concerns about hurting development. So in a first-of-its-kind feat, engineers reversed the river by digging a series of canals that not only carried the stinking mess away from the lake, but also created the only shipping route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River.\nNow a modern threat \u2014 a voracious fish that biologists are desperate to keep out of Lake Michigan \u2014 has spurred serious talk of undertaking another engineering feat almost as bold as the original: reversing the river again to restore its flow into Lake Michigan.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers is studying ways to stop invasive species from moving between two of the nation\u2019s largest watersheds, including a proposal to block the canals and undo the engineering marvel that helped define Chicago.\nAfter the first reversal, the city at the edge of the prairie blossomed and today is known for stunning skyscrapers, a sparkling lakefront and a river dyed green every St. Patrick\u2019s Day in the heart of Chicago\u2019s downtown Loop.\nThe idea to reverse the river again got little traction when environmentalists suggested it a few years ago. But that was before Asian carp swam to within 25 miles of Lake Michigan, where they are being held at bay with electric barriers that deliver a nonlethal jolt. And it was before a study that showed dozens of other species were poised to move between the basins.\nThe fish are rapacious eaters that can grow to 4 feet and 100 pounds, and they have been migrating up the Mississippi and its tributaries for decades. Scientists say they could decimate the Great Lakes\u2019 $7 billion-a-year fishing industry and unravel the food web by starving out native species.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Those extra expletives you\u2019re hearing at the multiplex these days aren\u2019t just echoes.

Prior to Windows 7, you could use some of not so legal techniques like SSDT hooking to intercept system calls issued from the user space and do your custom pre-processing, but they are far from efficient or stable. The kernel mode driver could be helpful if it wouldn\u2019t require a digital signature granted by Microsoft. Actually, some tools like Sysmon or Process Monitor can be helpful, but they are closed-source and don\u2019t leave much room for extensibility or integration with external systems such as message queues, databases, endpoints, etc.\nFortunately, there is still hope. Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is the native logging infrastructure built into every major Windows subsystem. Thus, we have ETW providers that emit Ethernet frames, notifications from the USB subsystem, Active Directory logins, NTFS file system operations, just to name a few. The ETW overhead is pretty low, which makes it a perfect fit for production environments.\nHowever, the ETW API might be the one of the ugliest and the most verbose APIs ever constructed (it was publicly recognized by Microsoft). The extraction of the properties from the event buffer is truly a nightmare. The documentation is decent (if we don\u2019t take into account the event schemas), but it lacks some more practical examples. If you go and search the Web, you won\u2019t find any exhaustive material about ETW when looking into it from the programmer\u2019s perspective. If we add to this the fact that there are no implementations of ETW in dynamic programming languages like Python, which is frequently used for incident response work, reverse engineering and malware analysis, those were reasons enough for giving the inception to what now is officially called Fibratus (if you\u2019re wondering about the name, cirrus fibratus is the cloud formation type).\nFibratus is a tool (inspired on Sysdig) for exploration and tracing of the Windows kernel which relies on the kernel logger provider to collect the operating system activity. It does the heavy lifting on abstracting the cumbersome details of the ETW into a consistent mechanism capable of capturing a wide spectrum of operations such as file system I/O, process/thread creation, network activity, context switch instrumentation, registry activity, and so on. On top on Fibratus you can execute filaments, which are micro modules written in Python programming language. They provide a non-intrusive model to extend Fibratus with your own arsenal of tools leveraging the goodness of the Python\u2019s ecosystem. Because the way to interact with Fibratus is via CLI, it also uses the console as a primary sink to output the kernel\u2019s activity to the end user. Besides that, there are a number of output adapters such as SMTP, AMQP, and the Elasticsearch adapter to send the kernel information through those respective transports. Let\u2019s see how to setup Fibratus and configure it to aggregate the kernel event stream to Logsene \u2013 a log management service with Elasticsearch API.\nSometimes, it\u2019s interesting to spy on the specific process.

Those three runs were the final of the game and the Plainsmen won 9-6.\nCole Halpin started the game and lasted six innings, but Juan Esparza pitched Northeastern to victory. He lasted two innings, allowing zero hits and zero runs while striking out three and walking zero. Cameron Spaeth threw one inning in relief out of the bullpen. Esparza recorded the last six outs to earn the save for the Plainsmen.\nWith the series now tied 1-1, the Plainsmen needed game three on Monday to overtake the Lopes in standings.\nJaxon Rosencranz had himself a game by driving in six runs off two hits. The game started good for Northeastern as they scored four runs in the top of the first inning. They continued to add runs and hold off the Lopes until the bottom of five when Lamar scored two, making it a 9-2 ballgame.

The aluminum two-seater thrives on contradictions: slinky yet muscular, polite yet menacing, coupe or convertible. But fire up the engine, and you\u2019ll see that the British sports car hits on all cylinders: power, beauty, and comfort \u2014 delivered with a seductive growl.\nFor 2018, Jaguar has expanded the F-Type\u2019s range to 24 variants based on trim level, transmission, and drivetrain. New for this year, the F-Type\u2019s entry-level model runs on a turbocharged, four-cylinder engine that delivers 296 horsepower. Three trims use supercharged V6 engines to deliver 340, 380, and 400 horsepower. The R and top-of-the-line SVR trims draw from a supercharged V8 to achieve 550 horsepower and 575 horsepower, respectively. The SVR is the fastest of the bunch, hitting a top speed of 200 mph and zipping from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, and some trims come with the option for a six-speed manual, as well as all-wheel drive.\nWhether the roof is fixed or down, the F-Type\u2019s aluminum-trimmed, low-to-the-ground cabin is designed with one purpose: for the driver to commune with the car. The sculpted, hip-hugging seats offer snug support on twists, turns, and straightaways and provide the confidence to dial it up to 11. Jaguar\u2019s InControl Touch Pro infotainment system comes standard with an 8-inch touchscreen. Dashboard technology is not the F-Type\u2019s forte: the interface for the infotainment system feels dated, especially compared with rivals such as Porsche\u2019s Boxster and Cayman. But if you\u2019re sitting in this car, you shouldn\u2019t be looking to the center stack for your entertainment, anyway.\nThe F-Type has not been crash-tested by either of the two federal safety ratings agencies. Lane departure warning and emergency braking come standard on 2018 models. Options include lane keep assist and a park-assist function designed to facilitate parallel parking and guide the car out of a parking spot, as well.\nThe base model delivers 23 mpg around town and 30 mpg on the highway. Fuel economy drops depending on the drivetrain configuration. Models equipped with the V8 engine eke out 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway.\nStarting prices for the 2018 Jaguar F-Type range between $59,900 for the base model coupe and $125,000 for the high-performance SVR convertible."}

Since early 2015, the company and fellow diversified 3D printing leader, Stratasys, have struggled to grow revenue amid a slowdown in demand for their enterprise 3D printers.\nWhile 3D Systems has made some poor moves over the past several years, it&apos;s made a few solid moves in 2016 that have helped spur some positive market sentiment. While the company&apos;s business continues to struggle, its stock is having a great 2016, as it&apos;s up 71%, as of Dec. 5 -- a welcome bounce for longtime investors who have watched the stock get clobbered since 2014.\nHere are 3D Systems&apos; best moves, to date, in 2016.\nAfter what turned into a five-month search for a permanent CEO, in April, 3D Systems named Vyomesh Joshi to the top spot. Joshi was a longtime top printing exec at 2D-printing goliath HP Inc. back when it was Hewlett-Packard before the split into two companies.\nWhile it seems a positive that 3D Systems&apos; chose someone with Joshi&apos;s background, I&apos;m neutral on the man himself at the moment, based upon the three quarterly earnings calls in which he&apos;s been involved.\nOne thing Joshi has done right was making cleaning house in the C-suite one of his top priorities. In June, 3D Systems announced the resignations of its chief operating officer and chief marketing officer -- it&apos;s probably safe to say that both individuals were forced out. Neither of these positions has been filled.\nSoon thereafter, the company announced a changing of the guard in the top financial spot, with John McMullen becoming the new CFO on July 1. McMullen had been serving as CFO at Eastman Kodak when his former colleague came knocking, as he worked with Joshi at the former Hewlett-Packard.\nWhether 3D Systems&apos; former CFO, COO, and CMO were performing their jobs well or not is partially irrelevant.It&apos;s common for CEOs who have been hired to turn around struggling companies to part ways with C-level execs so they can can choose their own top teams. This move was especially critical in 3D Systems&apos; case, because the company, according to Glassdoor ratings, has long had a poor corporate culture -- which will often cause good talent to leave. Corporate culture starts at the top and is notoriously difficult to change, which means that anything but a major sweep at the top isn&apos;t likely to be effective at bringing about meaningful positive changes.\nEarlier this year, 3D Systems introduced a new 3D printing technology that it&apos;s been developing called Figure 4. In September, the company demonstrated an updated version of this tech at the International Manufacturing Trade Show in Chicago.\nFigure 4 is a robotic, modular, stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing system that the company claims is 50 times faster than conventional SLA technology. Given its speed and other key features, 3D Systems views this tech as a key component of its strategy to capitalize as 3D printing shifts from a primarily prototyping technology to one that&apos;s used in a wider range of production applications.\nJoshi said on the third-quarter earnings call that"}

Specifically taking direction and intensity into account within the incoming audio data, the display on the glasses would show directional arrows and flashing lights that increase in intensity when a loud noise approaches the user. For instance, when a hearing-impaired person is crossing the street, the glasses would indicate if a nearby car is honking and point the user in the direction of the noisy vehicle.\nIn addition to directional sound, Google is also attempting to work speech recognition into the glasses. Hypothetically, the speech-to-text feature would determine what a nearby person is saying and display the text of the conversation on the display of the glasses.\nAccording to the patent, Google would differentiate between people standing in a group by displaying a text bubble in a position on the display that is closest to whoever is currently talking. Beyond displaying the text on the display, the glasses would also indicate what type of object or living being is making a sound. For instance, if a dog is barking, the display would indicate that fact.\nAlso included in the patent, the glasses will include multiple video cameras and microphones to capture several angles in addition to a \u201cfinger-operable touch pad\u201d that would accept user commands. Google also laid out a scenario where the video feed from the front-facing camera will be combined with computer generated images in order to create an augmented reality for the user.

It is where he was arrested, cuffed and placed on the floor of a police van. And it is where a CVS drug store was looted and burned, later serving as the staging area for protesters. But Gray's death is a small part of the decades-old human tragedy that defines this Census tract of Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park.\nMore than half of the people (ages 16-64) in this area are unemployed. In 2012, 49 percent of its high school students were \"chronically absent,\" 61 percent of the population 25 and older lacked a high school degree, and a third of this community's houses were vacant. Even more disturbing, Sandtown-Winchester has more people in Maryland's prison system than any other community in the state. Maryland taxpayers spend nearly $17 million a year to keep 458 people from this Census tract in prison, according to a recent Justice Policy Institute report.\nState Sen. Catherine Pugh, who represents the area, told me that fixing the neighborhood's problems is not something the city, or even the state, can do alone. It's going to take a public-private partnership.\nPugh is talking about the kind of partnerships that turned Baltimore's once comatose waterfront into a commercially successful Inner Harbor, and spawned construction of two professional sports stadiums and an explosive growth of downtown housing.\nShe wants politicians and business leaders to do the same for Sandtown-Winchester, an area where more than 9,000 people occupy just half a square mile of land. \"We need to create the kind of environment there that people want to live in,\" Pugh said.\nTo do this, she wants the city's public and private universities to work with city and state leaders to offer employment and financial incentives to graduates who will renovate and live in the area's vacant homes. This a good idea that is not unlike what city officials did years ago to spur the growth of Baltimore's nationally acclaimed Inner Harbor.\nWhat Pugh seeks is a solution to the deeply rooted problems that take an even greater toll in the city's black community than the senseless death of Freddie Gray.\nDeWayne Wickham, dean of Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication, writes on Tuesdays for USA Today."}

In April the city fined a driver 1 million won for providing an Uber ride using a rented car. The city additionally criticized the ride-hailing service for lacking proper background checks of drivers and failing to provide appropriate insurance for users in case of accidents.\nBut at a media briefing in Seoul on Wednesday the head of Uber\u2019s Asia business, Allen Penn, said the company only partners with licensed companies and drivers, and is only a technology platform that matches rides with end users.\n\u201cWe see this type of discussion around the world. The regulations are outdated. The regulations have existed since long before we began carrying around smartphones in our pockets,\u201d Penn said.

Now we must distinguish between these two different things: first \u2018being united with him and declared righteous as a gift\u2019 and second \u2018enjoying communion with him\u2019. In his book, \u2018Communion with the Triune God\u2019, John Owen speaks about union and communion with Jesus.\nFirst, he says that we are united with Jesus and have received his righteousness for ever and that this is the basis of our relationship with him. Our relationship is never based on how much we\u2019ve enjoyed his fellowship. Sadly, many believers think that if they have a season of remoteness from God, he\u2019s unhappy with them and they end up in condemnation. Jesus is our righteousness for eternity. God poured out his wrath on his Son and we escape. We never move from our righteousness in Christ. Even if we don\u2019t have an extended time of fellowship with him, we can still say, \u2018Thank you, Lord. You\u2019re the same yesterday, today and for ever, my righteousness.\u2019 That\u2019s union with Christ.\nSecond, Owen says that once we have union with Christ, we go on to have communion with him. We talk to him and listen to his voice. We hear him through the Scriptures and sing praises to him for the sheer joy of knowing that he\u2019s our God. This is how we get strengthened with might in our inner being. We have fellowship with Jesus.\nDay after day we experience fear, battle, hurts, sickness, wounds, unkindness and perplexity. We didn\u2019t expect what\u2019s happened to us. . How do we get through? \u2018Well, pull yourself together!\u2019 No! Our strength comes from Jesus. Isn\u2019t he the Saviour?

One day he\u2019ll save us when he presents us to himself in glory. But while we\u2019re on earth things will go wrong.

But so far, it hasn't spent a dime on midterm elections.\nIf 2012 was the campaign of the super PAC, 2013 is shaping up to prove the maxim that there's an unceasing appetite for groups to spend money in politics. But there's one power player that's lying low in the off year: Karl Rove's American Crossroads. Even with the influx of outside cash, the granddaddy of all super PACs hasn't spent a dime on campaign activity this year.\nAt a time when growing numbers of GOP strategists believe that (very) early engagement against opponents is preferable to a last-minute blitz, Crossroads' passivity stands out. Crossroads hasn't spent any money to soften up Democratic senators in trouble next year. At this point in 2011, it spent early money to hit Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and former Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. There's no similar ad blitz being planned to soften up vulnerable Democrats in 2014.\nIndeed, the group has held its fire since starting off the year on a controversial note. Soon after the 2012 elections, American Crossroads launched the Conservative Victory Project, a spinoff group designed to prevent weak candidates from emerging in big Senate races. It immediately drew harsh criticism from grassroots conservatives, and hasn't been heard from since February. Meanwhile, the party still faces the very real threat of a Todd Akin-like candidate emerging in ruby-red Georgia, and GOP recruiting in the traditional battleground states has lagged.\nMeanwhile, the group drew fire from Republicans when it stayed out of this year's high-profile Massachusetts Senate race, declining to assist the party's Hispanic nominee whose campaign was badly outspent by Democratic outside groups. Based on its polling, Crossroads didn't think the race was winnable, and didn't want to start off the year with an expensive defeat. But it was also a leap to assume Gabriel Gomez couldn't win without giving him the resources to get his message out.\nIt's in stark contrast to the flurry of early political activity around them, where money from other outside groups is being spent with abandon. On the left, the League of Conservation Voters already dished out $2 million this summer against Republicans, hitting Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who's not even on the ballot until 2016, along with other vulnerable representatives. The Democratic House Majority super PAC spent big against South Carolina's Mark Sanford, while its Senate counterpart helped Edward Markey win the vacant seat in Massachusetts.\nOn the right, the Senate Conservatives Fund has been irritating Republican senators with a slew of radio ads urging them to defund Obamacare. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, facing a challenging reelection, even has his own super PAC attacking his opposition.\nAnd independent New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is continuing to spend big bucks attacking gun-supporting politicos. Last month, he spent $350,000 to back two Democratic Colorado state senators, both of whom lost recalls this month for supporting gun-control legislation in their state.\nSeveral factors are contributing to American Crossroads' lower profile this year.

He called the demonstrations \"a planned attack\" carried out by \"organized, professionally staged wise guys.\"\n\"What happened yesterday was incredible,\" Trump said. \"It was determined that if we go in it could cause really bad, bad vibes.\"\n\"You have to understand they want me to tell my people, \u2018Please be nice.\u2019 My people are nice!\" he said to cheers. \"They caused no problems.
