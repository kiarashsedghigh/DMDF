Thousands of flowers and candles have been laid in front of the cathedral as people pay their respects to the victims. Crown Prince Haakon Magnus was among the prominent visitors also invited to an Oslo mosque in a sign of national unity.\nCROWN PRINCE HAAKON MAGNUS: [translated] We have taken this initiative because of the incident on Friday. The people of the nation are in mourning. It is a difficult time, and we wish to distribute a message of hope, warmth, generosity and peace.\nAMY GOODMAN: The suspect in the Norwegian attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, allegedly set off a bomb outside government buildings in Oslo Friday and then opened fire on a Labour Party summer camp for youth activists on a nearby island. During a court hearing Monday, he accepted responsibility for the killings but denied charges of terrorism. He says he belonged to an anti-Islam network that has two cells in Norway and more abroad. But Norwegian police and researchers have cast doubt on whether such an organization exists.\nBreivik faces terror-related charges that carry a maximum 21-year sentence. His defense lawyer, Geir Lippestad, told reporters yesterday his client appears to be insane and that he would quit if Breivik did not agree to psychological tests.\nGEIR LIPPESTAD: This whole case has indicated he\u2019s insane. He said it was necessary to start a war here in Europe and throughout the Western world. So, he\u2019s sorry that it was necessary, but it was necessary, he says.\nAMY GOODMAN: But the suggestion that Anders Breivik is insane has been rejected by scholars following the rise of right-wing extremism. Instead, they see him as the extension of a virulently xenophobic narrative with deep roots in the United States.\nEven after the massacre in Norway, right-wing pundits in the U.S. have come out in defense of Breivik\u2019s analysis, if not actions. On Monday, Pat Buchanan wrote at The American Conservative, quote, \u201cAs for a climactic conflict between a once-Christian West and an Islamic world that is growing in numbers and advancing inexorably into Europe for the third time in 14 centuries, on this one, Breivik may be right,\u201d unquote.\nFor more, we\u2019re joined by someone who\u2019s made his way through much of the 1,500-page manifesto.

Confederate statues illustrate what W.E.B. du Bois called the \u201cpropaganda of history.\u201d For example, the Battle of Liberty Place monument in New Orleans was put up to commemorate a vigilante attack on black lawmakers and policemen in a period when segregation and black disenfranchisement took root in the region. This monument valorized the actions of the vigilantes and attempted to erase the period before, when African Americans had access to political office and the ballot. Defenders of Confederate statues argue that we need them to remember our history, but such statues represent at best an incomplete history and at worst a lie.\nJohn Smolenski expanded on Downs\u2019 comments by posing several questions to help us approach the issue of commemoration. Why did people create these statues? What is their purpose? What are we trying to remember? What values are we trying to convey by keeping these statues standing? Ultimately, we must remember the difference between memory and history as we continue to debate the problem of commemoration, and that efforts to commemorate memories can lead to the promotion of false information inadvertently granted the weight of historical truth.\nCecilia Tsu approached the issue of refugee policy by considering the commitment to refugees in theory versus practice. While the Statue of Liberty predates the concept of refugees in international law, it broadcasts a theoretical commitment to providing safe haven to those seeking freedom. The U.S. signed the UN protocol on refugees in 1967, establishing its official commitment to refugees. Theory operates differently than practice, however, as each individual country that signed the protocol determines who is deserving of refugee status.\nAnother complication when it comes to refugees is one of justification.

Instead, they will be called to a confidential but mandatory proceeding called a \u201cCity Attorney Hearing,\u201d an alternative to prosecution that can be described as a \u201cwarning\u201d not to repeat the conduct. One legal expert compared it to a \u201cdeferred prosecution,\u201d but stressed that a full trial could still result.\nVictims generally do not appear at such a hearing, the City Attorney\u2019s office explained, and generally no criminal record attaches to the accused. Still, the prosecutor retains the right to issue charges later if he feels the illegal conduct has recurred or may recur.\nLos Angeles conducts hundreds of such closed-door hearings each year to dispose of minor misdemeanors arising from, for example, neighbor disputes, domestic disharmony, or curfew violations.\nSouth of Los Angeles, in Orange County, newly installed prosecutor Todd Spitzer is still undecided about prosecuting rambunctious disruptors of a pro-Israel event at University of California Irvine that also took place last May, according to official university sources. Spitzer\u2019s office has asked for additional police investigation to develop more facts.\nWith or without actual prosecution, the two incidents and the Jewish community\u2019s response have potentially changed the landscape for belligerent disruption of pro-Israel events on California campuses, which last year were arguably among the most pernicious in the nation. Those involved in the two California events \u2013 the affected students and the Jewish communal groups who rose up to invoke prosecutions \u2013 expressed a range of reactions on whether justice has been either minimally obtained or seriously delayed.\nOutrage first erupted after two separate but particularly belligerent disruptions of pro-Israel UC student events took place in May 2018. On May 7, College Republicans at UCI, hosting Israeli reservists, saw their session shattered by a sudden invasion of bullhorn-wielding BDS advocates chanting anti-Israel slogans. A few days later, on May 17, Students Supporting Israel at UCLA sponsored an outreach panel discussion with indigenous students only to have it violently shut down by nose-to-nose BDS harassment. Both dramatic disruptions were captured on viral video.\nFor Jewish students and legal defense groups, these two egregious incidents were the tipping point of campus harassment at UC schools. The consensus among Jewish leadership and students was that the school administrations had consciously created a permissive anti-Israel atmosphere so toxic that it virtually encouraged increasingly severe forms of anti-Israel harassment. At UCI, the video shows bull-horn disruption going for several minutes as police and university administrators watched.\nInitially, both UCLA and UCI administrations declined to refer the incidents to the police for investigation and prosecution. This reinforced the belief that the permissive environment on campus actually promoted harassment as a bizarre species of free speech. Moreover, the legal system itself permits the universities to exercise broad discretion, allowing them to simply look the other way. California\u2019s unusual state laws juridically enable the universities to potentially create a double standard and promote unequal justice. The UC administration can decide who shall be referred to its own police force and who shall be given a pass, or subjected to so-called \u201cacademic discipline.\u201d No referral to the police means no referral to prosecutors.\nObservers believe a"}

A cosmopolitan city standing between Syria and Mesopotamia and, therefore, at the crossroads of politics, commerce, cultures, and religions between the Mediterranean and the Near East, Dura-Europos disappeared from view, buried by time until rediscovered in 1920. In Edge of Empires: Pagans, Jews, and Christians at Roman Dura-Europos, which through January 8, 2012 at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, that city lives again and offers a snapshot of how the people in that time and place viewed their world and themselves. The art of Dura-Europos, sometimes called \u201cDurene Art,\u201d fills in an important \u201cmissing link\u201d of art history\u2014the elusive time known as Late Antiquity, or the gap from the third to the seventh centuries when Classical Antiquity disappeared and the Middle Ages, formerly known as the \u201cDark Ages,\u201d emerged. By shedding light on how the glory of Rome faded into the shadows of the murky Middle Ages, Edge of Empires provides the final piece of a long-incomplete puzzle.\n\u201cThis was a polyglot city, where Aramaic and Parthian could be heard alongside the Latin of the Roman legionaries and the Greek of the Roman imperial administration,\u201d G.W. Bowersock writes in the introduction to the exhibition catalog. Abandoned after the Persian onslaught, Dura-Europos soon slept silently beneath the sands of time. Reawakened after World War I, the city amazed its discoverers with its fresco-filled synagogue, early Christian chapel, shrines and temples to the old gods, and lavish home of the Roman commander, complete with picturesque view of the Euphrates below. Dura-Europos captures a moment when all the faiths\u2014old and new\u2014coexisted in relative peace, just before the Middle Ages\u2019 ceaseless contest for souls plunged the Western world into darkness.\nThelma K. Thomas of New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts explains Dura-Europos\u2019 significance in art history. Calling its vast spectrum of religious art and architecture \u201cunparalleled,\u201d Thomas believes that this bounty comes from a trend \u201ccharacteristic of Late Antique culture across Eurasia: the stagy display of material wealth in self-presentation.\u201d These people wanted to be known in their own time and adopted or adapted styles from every corner of the Roman Empire (and beyond) to tell their story. In addition to the Jewish, Christian, and Middle Eastern touches, elements of Celtic, Persian, and even Chinese art and culture found a home in the remote outpost at the edge of the empire.\nThomas doesn\u2019t see a unified statement in Durene art. Instead, she sees representations of a community built up over time. A portrait of an elite family from the second century after Christ brings them to life again. A Roman tribune and commander chooses to be depicted with his soldiers while sacrificing to the male gods\u2014a macho image for the ages. Thomas remarks on how some figures \u201cturn from the sacrifice to face front and look through the \u2018window\u2019 of their pictorial space, as if to address their audience, members of their religious community.\u201d This caught-in-"}

It covers urbanisable areas of urban extensions at 95 villages in the city.\nUnder the land pooling policy, agencies will develop infrastructure like roads, schools, hospitals, community centres and stadia on part of the pooled land, and return a portion of the plot to farmers who can later execute housing projects with the help of private builders.\nSources said the authority considered the suggestions and objections offered by the public to the urban body recently. A floor-area ratio (FAR) of 400 had been requested, but the DDA decided for 200 units due to various constraints, they said.\n\"Considering the availability of resources and services, FAR of 200 is recommended for the development in the land pooling policy keeping in view availability of water, requirement of land for physical and social infrastructure and impact on environment,\" the DDA said.\nFormulated with an aim to provide affordable housing in Delhi, the policy is also expected to trigger huge economic, social and civic development of the city. It is likely to \"benefit lakhs of farmers\" while generating immense investment opportunities, it said.\nUnder the policy, over five lakh of the 1.7 million houses will be built for the economically weaker sections, the housing authority said.\nThis will go a long way in meeting the goals of housing for all, officials said.\nLast December, the DDA's highest decision-making body had approved simplification of the land pooling policy in the national capital and the DDA's role as being a \"facilitator, regulator and planner only\".\nThis effectively means that the transfer of pooled land to the DDA will not be required.\nOriginally, the land pooled under the policy was to be transferred to the DDA, which would act as the developer entity and undertake further sectoral planning and development of infrastructure on the land pooled.\nLand owners having land of any size can participate under the land pooling policy. However, the minimum area to be taken up for development would be two hectares. A Developer Entity (DE)/ individual can participate in the scheme by pooling land parcels covered under a sector as per the Zonal Development Plan, the DDA said.\nDifferential land return in two categories has been replaced with uniform division of land on 60:40 basis in the modified policy, thereby benefitting small land holders or farmers."}

In a September research trip to Sochi, Human Rights Watch learned that the concerns we raised in our May letter remain unaddressed.\nThe procedures for notifying residents of expropriation, establishing compensation and resettlement, and allowing residents to challenge valuations remain inadequate and lack transparency. Most of the residents we interviewed said they received notice of expropriation of their property months ago, in some cases a year ago, but have received no further information about the timing of the expropriation or available resettlement options.\nIn some cases initial property valuations have been performed, but final assessments have not been granted. In every case documented by Human Rights Watch, the assessors valued the property at less than the amount on which the residents are currently assessed for property taxes. Several property owners were told informally that the initial assessments will be further reduced in connection with a drop in property values-although it would be reasonable to anticipate that some values will rise because of the Games. Other residents were told that compensation would be reduced because the government does not have sufficient funds to pay compensation due to the financial crisis.\nIn most cases expropriation will take the form of a forced sale, meaning the property owners are required to sell their property to the government at a sale price less than the current valuation and must pay 13 percent property taxes on the amount of the sale.\nHaving been informed that their property will be expropriated, residents do not want to make further investments or improvements to their property. However, without information concerning compensation or when the expropriation will go into effect, they cannot plan for resettlement. In all, the lack of information has left residents in a state of limbo.\nIn one such case, Mikhail M. (his name is not disclosed to protect his security) owns a large plot near a river, along which a rail line and road are now being built. His parents-in-law have lived on the property for the last three years. They live in a two-room hut while they work to construct a three-storey house that they had planned to share with Mikhail M. and his family. The family received an expropriation notice in October 2008. A property assessment was performed but the family has received no notice of the amount of the valuation nor an offer of compensation. Because the property will be expropriated, the family has stopped construction on the house, which now remains partially built and uninhabitable. The small hut in which they live has been severely damaged by the nearby road and rail construction.\nIn another case, Savelii Cholak owns an 817 square meter property on which he had planned to build a house. He received notice of the expropriation of his land in October 2008 and a subsequent offer to obtain new property in one of the planned resettlement areas. His property was assessed at 9,250,000 rubles, less than the officially recorded value of 10,621,000 on which he currently pays annual property taxes. After Cholak agreed to the compensation offered for his property, he received a draft contract with a property valuation reduced to 6,656,774 rubles. He wrote a formal notice rescinding his agreement to the compensation but received a reply from the government that it is unable to pay him the originally proffered amount.

Anthony dollar, which (being Canadian, I didn't know) was often confused with the quarter because of its color and feel. The newer coin is a golden color with no ribbing along the sides to prevent confusion, just like the Presidential coins introduced this year by the US Mint . When the coins were introduced, Michael Claus, W. Reid Shepherd and Brandon Wayne at Michigan State University asked \"is one form of the dollar better for the environment? If the coin dollar is better, should we replace the paper dollar with its coin equivalent? If the paper dollar is better, and Americans trust the paper dollar more than the coin, wouldn't it be prudent to stop introducing new coins into the American economy?\" Their answer: the coin is better.\nTheir study tried to examine the life cycle of the coin dollar and the paper dollar (note) to determine if one was better for the environment. On the economic front: the dollar note costs 4 cents to produce with an average lifetime of 18 months. The dollar coin costs 8 cents with an average lifetime of 30 years. Information was collected from the United States Federal Government through the Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the United States Mint. To prevent counterfeiting, these sources did not provide all details to the process, requiring some assumptions about the process to be made. However, the most important observations include the lifetime for the coin and note, 30 years and 1.5 years respectively, and the recycling and disposal of the two types of dollars. The coin is completely recycled into the production process after leaving circulation, where 90% of the dollar note is placed in landfill after leaving circulation and the other 10% is recycled as ROOFING SHINGLES! They recommended that the one-dollar note be phased out and completely replaced by the coin dollar.\n\"The paper note is made from 75% virgin cotton 25% linen blend of paper, and industrial oil based ink is used to produce the coloring on the paper. A reusable metal plate is used to imprint the design on the note. Only non-recycled cotton and linen may be used in the printing of the paper note. The paper dollar is bleached and shredded after circulation and only 10% is recycled as roofing shingles. The other 90% is placed in landfills The coin dollar is made from 88.5 % copper (Cu), 6% zinc (Zn), 3.5% manganese (Mn), and 2% nickel (Ni). The process allows for a complete recycle of the metal used to manufacture the coin, including the final coin when it comes out of circulation and all metal waste from the process itself.\"\nAlthough this study is well-intended, these folks delve into a complex process that is highly restricted by Acts of Congress: processes can't be changed unless by an Act of Congress and the details of production processes and the true composition of both coins and notes are confidential to prevent counterfeiting. They have also left out the energy requirements for raw materials extraction of the metals for the coin and the cotton and linen for the note. It would be interesting to compare these energy requirements and environmental impacts. However, the general conclusions based on the fact that the coin has a 30-year life cycle and can be completely recycled, while the note only lasts for 18 months leads us to believe that they are correct despite the lack of information.

Cameron Herold, business consultant and author of Double Double: How to Double Your Revenue and Profit in Three Years or Less, told Fast Company in a 2015 article that there are three types of meetings: information share, creative discussion, and consensus meetings.\nIn information-share meetings, attendees are expected to listen, and discussions are generally limited to \u201crequests for clarification.\u201d Creative discussion meetings tend to be an exercise in brainstorming, and consensus meetings require participants to make a unanimous decision. Having a good idea of what type of discussion will take place ahead of time lets you be better prepared, and allows you to plan accordingly.\nHaving an objective is one thing, but a productive meeting focuses on what needs to happen in order to meet that objective. Connie Williams, CMO & chief knowledge officer at Syneticsworld, a company that studies meeting processes, told Fast Company that instead of focusing on the problem, facilitators should frame the agenda in \u201cproblem-solving\u201d language. Some examples: How can we build a better campaign? How can we find new clients? As Williams explained, encouraging people to think about solutions means that they\u2019re less likely to focus on the problems.\nIn addition to being solution-focused, a productive meeting prioritizes the most important items and tackles those first. Mat MacInnis, CEO and founder of digital content platform Inkling, previously wrote in Fast Company that his team would always prioritize the meeting items based on what they need to get done that week, and park any debates that spin into \u201cstrategic, long-term conversations\u201d for later discussions. At the end of the meeting, everyone knows exactly what they need to execute for the rest of the week.\nSometimes, it\u2019s not the meeting itself that\u2019s unproductive, but the attendees. Whether they\u2019re answering emails instead of listening to an important announcement, or they\u2019re constantly interrupting another, there needs to be a system in place to prevent this from derailing your meeting. For one, you can either ban digital devices in meetings, or limit them to those who may need them for meeting purposes, such as pulling up a presentation. If it is interruption that you\u2019re trying to fix, you can assign someone to monitor and interject the interruptors, setting the expectation that people should be able to finish what they want to say at every meeting."}

Paul Zukunft told a House panel on Wednesday.\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\u2019s panel that oversees the Coast Guard, said during a hearing that the service\u2019s budget request for acquisition programs goes from nearly $1.9 billion in FY \u201919 down to $1.4 billion in FY \u201920. Zukunft replied that most of the $500 million drop is related to the heavy polar icebreaker program, noting that the service will need additional funding in the out-years to keep the program going.\nOut-year budget figures cited by Hunter are contained a table the Coast Guard provided the subcommittee from its forthcoming Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2019 through 2023, a spokesman for the service\u2019s acquisition directorate told Defense Daily.\n\u201cAnd that is a concern when I see that precipitous of a drop because that drop is mostly in [the] polar icebreaker building program,\u201d Zukunft told Hunter. \u201cSo that is a significant add-on that we\u2019re going to need going forward.\u201d Later in the hearing, Zukunft said that keeping the icebreaker program on track is the \u201cgreatest risk\u201d if the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition account continues to be underfunded.\n\u201cThere is going to be tension as we look at how do we fund other priorities within the Department of Homeland Security and a concern that I will pass on to my relief is you may enter another cycle of flat-lined budgets at a point in time where our needs are continuing to grow, particularly in this domain,\u201d Zukunft said.\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s current program of record is to acquire three new heavy polar icebreakers and eventually three new medium polar icebreakers. Earlier this month the Navy, on behalf of an integrated program office with the Coast Guard, released a Request for Proposals for detailed design and construction of the first new vessel.\nResponses to the solicitation are due by May 11. Zukunft said that when a decision is ready to award a contract for final design and construction of the first ship, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in a position to make a decision on a block buy.\u201d The block buy refers to awarding a single contract that would cover multiple years of procurement for the icebreaker program, in this case likely the final two heavy vessels.\nThe Coast Guard is seeking $750 million in FY \u201919 for the detail design and construction of the first new heavy icebreaker. Congress appropriated $150 million in FY \u201917 in the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding account toward the icebreaker. Language in the FY \u201918 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the Navy to procure one heavy polar icebreaker that would be operated by the Coast Guard.\nThe icebreaker program in the FY \u201919 request is the beneficiary of a two-year congressional budget deal to increase spending for the Defense Department and federal civilian agencies for FY \u201918 and FY \u201919. The Coast Guard\u2019s original plan was for $30 million for the heavy icebreaker, but once the budget deal was agreed to, the Trump administration amended the FY \u201919 request to add $720 million for the icebreaker, which keeps the program on track for an award in FY \u201919 and delivery in"}

Trump is fuzzy on whether he stands on one of his signature his campaign promises, but Ryan indicated Thursday he's inclined to help keep children of undocumented parents in the country. \"No,\" he said when asked by an undocumented woman whether he thinks she should be deported.\nUPDATE: Besides Obamacare, Republicans on the Hill push back by pointing out Ryan and Trump agree on the majority of this year's congressional agenda: Ending sanctuary cities, cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, tax reform, having some kind of barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing \"responsibly\" with everyone President Obama deferred deportations to.\nBut when it comes to some critical decisions, such as how tough to get on Russia, or whether to get super tough on immigration, or how much federal money to spend on things like infrastructure reform, or whether to slap tariffs on imported goods, Trump increasingly looks like he's on an island within his own party.\nEven his own Cabinet nominees repeatedly broke with his campaign promises on everything from prosecuting Hillary Clinton to playing nice with Russia in their confirmation hearings this week.\nWhat's going on now between Trump and Republican leaders has some echoes of the dynamic during the presidential campaign: Ryan and other GOP leaders would highlight their agreements with Trump (repeal Obamacare, get a conservative on the Supreme Court, tax reform), but there were also very conspicuous disagreements (a Muslim ban, NATO, that darn Russia thing again).\nAt one point during the campaign, Ryan denounced or disagreed with something Trump said roughly once a week.\nBy the end of the campaign, Ryan had broken up with Trump completely.\nRyan appears to still be very excited that he has a Republican president \u2014 it's topped his wish list since he suddenly became speaker in the fall of 2015. And he's not trying to hide the fact that there are some rifts between him and the president he got. \"Look, we don't all agree on everything. I think people kind of know that,\" Ryan acknowledged Thursday.\nHe also appeared willing to meet Trump in the middle on some things, such as some kind of tax break for child care, a top Trump priority.\nBut the fact remains that Ryan and McConnell are now charged with legislating the agenda of a president whose views on some major issues they do not share.\nRight now the disagreements are manifesting themselves as cracks in Republicans' stranglehold on Washington. But keep an eye on how much those cracks widen. It could mean the difference between whether Trump's grab-bag conservative populism reshapes the Republican Party \u2014 or gets buried by more traditional Republicans who don't agree."}

Today, as we move full throttle into an increasingly globalized era, we must cultivate new educational systems that prepare our children for meaningful participation and growth in a new world.\nIn California, we have been on a remarkable journey in recent years, moving away from outdated, centralized state systems to flexible, local control.\nThe Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) California adopted in 2013 moves equity into the driver's seat for this journey; it provides districts great flexibility in creating continuous improvement plans for teaching and learning for all students, especially those with the greatest needs - English learners, foster youth, and those from low-income families.\nYet, during the first three years of LCFF implementation, most of California's attention focused on system accountability: how we determine whether we have been successful. In September, the State Board of Education (SBE) took a remarkable step forward with this work by adopting the first phase of the LCFF Evaluation Rubrics, which spell out how we measure school and district progress.\nNow California faces a deeper challenge: a shift in focus from accountability to building systems of supports that foster success. As state board President Mike Kirst has noted, \"... [we] must move now from the back end of accountability to the front end of capacity.\nTo do this, California has committed to a path of continuous improvement, but what does this mean, and how will we get there?\nWe believe the continuous improvement process underway at the California Department of Education (CDE) may serve as a model for this path.\n...learns from experience by carefully measuring the effectiveness of different policies and practices, supporting the intrinsic motivation of educators and stakeholders, sharing best and promising practices, cultivating a culture of reflection and learning, encouraging innovation, and making changes based on learning.\nTo promote their ongoing success, high-performing education systems rely on cycles of inquiry, where participants reflect and analyze current practice and then collaborate to support growth and improve their results. Similarly, we know that successful education change efforts engage change makers at the school, district, and state levels in reflection, planning, and action in ongoing cycles of engagement.\nWe can then posit a continuous improvement theory of change that intentionally links inquiry into what works with effective stakeholder engagement.\nThe CDE is building its own continuous improvement capacity by implementing a key recommendation of our Blueprint 2.0 strategic plan: In order to better serve and support districts and LEAs...continue work to build the CDE's capacity for service and support.\nOur process for building our own capacity, aptly called \"CDE Team Advancement,\" includes creating our own continuous improvement Cycle of Inquiry methodology: \"Discover, Design, and Deliver.\" Discover\u2014what works well, strengths, and challenges; Design\u2014actions that will generate improvement; and Deliver\u2014 results. Repeat cycle. We always keep in mind the goal of our improvement efforts: better serving students.\nCDE Team Advancement success hinges on the effective participation of as many CDE team members as possible in our Cycle of Engagement. We have now completed two of these cycles resulting in the creation, initial implementation, and evaluation of the CDE Team Advancement Plan.\nOur efforts are producing results. For example, we created a Local Control and Accountability Support Team at the CDE to help all our districts work on our LCFF state priorities, which include improving parental engagement and school climate, and raising student achievement.

Everyone was trying to figure out what lunacy drove retired accountant and real estate developer Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, to kill at least 59 people and injure hundreds more at a country music festival.\nWith all due respect to those who find the word \u201ccrazy\u201d to be insensitive, few other words capture the utter senselessness of the slaughter in Las Vegas. Police say he fired away at the crowd of more than 20,000 from his 32d floor hotel suite before he killed himself as a SWAT team broke into his room.\nThe horror of the tragedy was only compounded by the lack of any apparent motive for Paddock\u2019s sick behavior.

Where do we go in our poverty of reliable information for uplifting calls of sympathy, empathy, unity, courage, safety and reassurance?\nFor one, we turn to the president. Can President Donald Trump step up to the job? He must. But this is a job for teleprompter Donald, not Twitter Trump.\nWe all know Twitter Trump.

San Jose leads the best-of-7 series 2-0.\nWhat we learned: The Sharks can play the same suffocating brand of defense that has been the Kings' stock-in-trade for the past five years. Los Angeles had five shots in the first period and two in the first 10 minutes of the second. San Jose was not much more industrious but did not need to be after scoring on its first shot and on a 5-on-3 power play in the second period to take control.\nWhat this means for Sharks: Breathing room. San Jose heads back to the Bay Area with a 2-0 lead in the series and three of the final five games at SAP Center. The Sharks have a far bigger margin of error now than they did when this series opened Thursday, but it is unlikely that complacency will accompany that knowledge. They had a 3-0 series lead on the Kings two years ago and watched helplessly as Los Angeles found the wherewithal to string together four consecutive victories to deliver the most painful Stanley Cup Playoff series loss in their history.\nWhat this means for Kings: Desperation. Nothing has worked right for Los Angeles in this series. San Jose has scored on its first shot in each game. The Kings blew two one-goal leads in Game 1. They never led in Game 2. Their power play has been ineffective, and their penalty kill has had breakdowns. Alec Martinez, their second-most valuable defenseman, didn't even last two periods in the series before leaving with an undisclosed injury. Their forward lines, stable for so long, were in a blender throughout Game 2. Sharks goalie Martin Jones, a former Kings farmhand, has stymied them at almost every turn so far. Now, they have to win four of the remaining five games, fueled mainly by the knowledge that it is imminently possible after pulling off an even more difficult task -- four in a row -- two years ago.\nKey moment: Kings forward Kris Versteeg drew a penalty on Sharks center Nick Spaling with 1:43 remaining in the second period. San Jose led 2-0, and Los Angeles was looking for momentum heading into intermission. Instead, Jones made three saves, including one with a quick-reaction stop on a backhand shot off a rebound by Milan Lucic and another on a short-range wrist shot by Jeff Carter. San Jose's Patrick Marleau also blocked a slap shot from Los Angeles defenseman Jamie McBain to frustrate the Kings heading into the dressing room.\nUnsung player of the game: San Jose defenseman Paul Martin rarely gets noticed playing in the shadow of his more flamboyant partner, Brent Burns, but Martin was at his understated best Saturday. He played 19:44, he was among the primary contributors on a penalty kill that stymied the Kings on four of five opportunities, he blocked three shots, and he had five hits, a Sharks high.\nWhat's next: Game 3 is at SAP Center on Monday (10:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN, CBC, TVA Sports, PRIME, CSN-CA). The Kings will need every minute between games to regroup from being swept at home."}

Apple normally reserves product announcements at different times like in March when the iPhone SE was announced.\nOne of the biggest changes expected to be announced is an upgrade to Siri, Apple\u2019s digital voice assistant. Not only is it said to be included with the next version of OS X (which is expected to be renamed to macOS), it will be opened up to third-party developers to help develop apps around it.\nCurrently, Siri only works with Apple\u2019s own services, but this would allow users to carry out actions on apps by asking the assistant. That means, come September, you could be able to order a taxi on Hailo or send a message on WhatsApp just by asking Siri.\nOther changes to iOS will likely involve Apple Music, which was announced at the same event last year. After criticism for having a less-than-straightforward interface, a revamped version will likely be announced at the event.\nAnother major change that will be announced at the keynote is how it deals with subscriptions in the App Store.

So much for Steinbrenner\u2019s wish Michael Pineda, Manny Banuelos and Dellin Betances would blossom.\nToday, Pineda is a colossal question mark after undergoing right shoulder surgery.\nMonday at George M. Steinbrenner Field, Pineda took a baby step forward in his attempt to make it back to the big leagues after not facing major league hitters since 2011, when he was with the Mariners.\nNearing the end of an early-morning bullpen session that was watched by manager Joe Girardi, pitching coach Larry Rothschild and bench coach Tony Pena, the 25-year-old Pineda drew praise.\n\u201cVery good, Michael,\u2019\u2019 Rothschild shouted.\nSoaked in sweat despite the morning\u2019s coolness, Pineda exited the pen with a smile on his face.\nThe odds of Pineda grabbing the fifth and final spot in Girardi\u2019s rotation were long during the offseason, and several impressive bullpen sessions haven\u2019t realistically shortened them.\nYet, Girardi doesn\u2019t have to decide who the fifth starter is until the final week of March.

{"idx": "36070", "prompt": "Continue the following text: By Omer Kaplan . Published on January 17, 2017.\nUp until recently, brand and performance advertisers typically walked two separate paths: brands bought media on a CPM/CPV basis; performance advertisers bought on a CPI/CPA basis. But with more than 50% of consumers' time spent on digital media spent in-app, the war for in-app traffic is heating up. Specifically, a rivalry is emerging between brands and increasingly sophisticated app advertisers, both of which are buying on a CPV basis to secure in-app inventory.\nPerformance advertisers are turning to CPV for a variety of factors. In-app inventory on the whole is going up in value. Also, the rising importance of in-app traffic for brand advertisers, coupled with a saturated app economy, is pushing app advertisers to invest more in user acquisition, which means that the in-app space is becoming increasingly competitive for all involved.\nFor a sophisticated performance advertiser buyer operating in this space, buying on CPV makes a lot of sense. Traditional CPI-based campaigns can sometimes place performance advertisers lower in the waterfall because the impact of the conversion from impression to install lowers the final CPM they generate -- meaning they lose out on precious in-app inventory, and are unable to scale. By buying on the same basis as brands, performance advertisers are effectively leveling the playing field, ensuring that their bids can be compared like for like.\nThe reason buying on a CPV-basis works, even within the context of a performance-based CPI campaign, is that performance advertisers have developed highly-evolved strategies for measuring the performance of their ad spend. Their familiarity with the in-app medium, and with calculating the LTV or value of their users as a function of ROAS, allows them to buy on a CPV basis and still ensure they are optimizing for high-quality users.\nPerformance advertisers are able to obtain high-quality users by paying for just a view in front of premium traffic, giving them a competitive advantage when battling for inventory. Brands, on the other hand, are often running campaigns with \"softer\" KPIs, such as awareness, which are less explicitly linked to potential, consumer-driven revenue, and therefore harder to connect to the cost of a view.\nIs CPV the new CPE?\nAs brands invest in mobile, we can expect competition over mobile in-app inventory to continue heating up. A few months ago, I posited that CPE could become the go-to metric for advertisers. With mobile video continuing to cannibalize the bulk of mobile traffic, however, it's possible that CPV could give CPE a run for it's money. In some senses, we're seeing a reverse trend, where a \"softer,\" less targeted metric is getting more play because it offers a way for performance advertisers to secure high-quality, in-app inventory in this new bidding war. What impact will that have on the mobile advertising industry as a whole?\nThe real winners in this situation are mobile app publishers, who will see revenues rise as the value of their inventory is driven up by competition. We'll also see the $22B gap between time spent in mobile and mobile ad spend, which Mary Meeker underscored in her annual internet trends report, close faster.\nIt's worth noting that CPV also provides publishers with a more reliable, less volatile, source of revenue, given that the user action required for payment is less specific than campaigns running on a cost-per-install or a cost-per-engagement basis. A rise in CPV campaigns will mean that publishers will be better able"}

During a potential shutdown, commissary customers would be able to access the DeCA website, www.commissaries.com. However, that site would not be updated during the shutdown. Customers would be able to access the Department of Defense website, http://www.defense.gov/ for any breaking news that affects service members and government civilians.\nHowever, during my latest visit to the commissary (which was, again, disappointing in it's lack of excitement) a customer service agent told me that while they will for sure be open tomorrow, they may not be open any day thereafter.\nSo the confusion continues -- at least a little bit.\nDepartment of Defense Education Activity \u2013 DODEA \u2013 Schools will remain open.\nCommissaries will remain open world-wide.\nExchanges will remain open world-wide.\nChild Development Centers will remain open with priority given to service members and DoD civilians supporting mission-essential operations.\nFamily Support Center staffing will be determined by installation commanders.\nMilitary OneSource\u2019s website and call center will remain fully operational.\nMilitary Family Life Counselors are available and will telework if access to offices is prohibited.\nFamily Advocacy Program Each Service will determine staffing at each installation.\nMWR \u2013 Morale Welfare and Recreation programs will close.

If people are going to throw punches over milk and bread, I want to be there to see it. I even had my video camera. (Maybe this makes me an ambulance chaser -- but I know you are counting on me for this stuff).\nWhat I found was a little disappointing -- or maybe it was encouraging. Not only were there no fruit battles in the produce section, but it altogether seemed like just a normal Friday in the store. No one was rushing the canned goods. No one was stockpiling frozen pizzas.\nThe rest of this base has the same feel. There are a few comments on Benning\u2019s MWR page asking about what may be closed starting tomorrow -- but other than that, nada.\nWhat this major lack of panic tells me is this: most people don\u2019t yet know what\u2019s going on or how it impacts them. The real drama, I suspect, will be tomorrow morning when customers hit the commissary only to find the doors locked.\nAs it stands here, the commissary will likely begin marking down perishable foods later this evening, a manger told me earlier. That means if you want to score cheap produce and meat, it might be a good idea to check-in with your commissary an hour or two before closing tonight to see if they, too, have marked stuff down."}

When it comes to transport, trains seem to feature prominently on the wish lists of big investment or \u2018nation building\u2019 projects. But how far could billions of dollars in new rail infrastructure actually go in improving congestion across our cities? Will cars inevitably win? If so, why?\n\u2018We need more public transport\u2019 is the silver bullet catch cry often heard in conjunction with debates about congestion in major cities. It has become so common that its validity is rarely tested. Even large scale commuter rail projects like Brisbane\u2019s proposed $5billion (or $8billion \u2013 what a few billion amongst friends?) cross river rail can still maintain preferred project status \u2013 despite no business case after several years of discussion and now being in the hands of the project\u2019s third state government.\nAs technology reshapes the nature of work - and with it where we work - and as Australia faces cities policy with renewed national interest \u2013 led primarily by our Prime Minister \u2013 it is timely to ask how infrastructure priorities might be shaped by evolving metropolitan form and the fast changing habits of urban inhabitants. Will old ways serve new days? Do we need more passenger rail, or will cars find a new purpose in decongesting our cities and serving a new economic model?\nSome recent figures through Macroplan serve to highlight the role played by rail in urban life. In 2013\u201314, there were 178.5 billion passenger kilometres travelled on capital city roads in Australia and 12.6 billion passenger kilometres travelled on urban rail networks. I\u2019ve written before that this share is unlikely to change for the simple fact that only around 10% of metropolitan wide jobs are based in central business districts of our major cities. Agreed, it\u2019s an important 10% for public transport because PT best serves a highly centralized workforce as you find in CBDs. Commuter rail in particular relies on a \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model, mainly designed to ferry people from into and out of CBDs.\nFor people who work in CBDs, a high proportion will use public transport \u2013 rail included. But that\u2019s a high proportion of the 10% minority of people in a metro wide area. Even if every single person who worked in a CBD caught PT, the mode share can never rise very high because around 90% of the workforce work in suburban areas, for which rail is not well suited. There has been a lot of talk about Transit Oriented Development (TODs) particularly around suburban rail nodes but despite decades of discussion, we are yet to see many (any?) genuine examples.\nAnd the reality is that the economy is fast suburbanizing. New employment engines in sectors like personal services or health and caring are not beneficiaries of industry proximity. Being close to others in the same industry might have been good for finance, property and business service industries in traditional CBDs but the fastest growing sector of our economy at present is health care related, where being close to the people being served is important. This is not the CBD. There is even evidence that technology startups in the US have tended to prefer suburban or high street locations, offering high amenity, ample low cost or free parking, and cheap (or free) premises. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of Apple fame started in a suburban garage after all."}

{"idx": "36079", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The rumble of Humvees and the buzz of choppers are already commonplace to the neighbors of this elite Army base in the rolling hills north of Dahlonega. Some worry they are about to become a lot more frequent if a North Georgia lawmaker's late legislative push succeeds.\nThe Army wants to take over a 282-acre swath of land that it leases from the Forest Service to train Army Rangers. After two decades of negotiations didn't yield a deal, Gainesville Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins stepped in with an amendment to a defense bill that gives the Army the land.\nNow environmental groups are worried that an expanded military presence could threaten pristine forestland, pollute churning streams and restrict access to the popular web of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails that criscross the area.\nWhat makes this fight particularly unusual is the Forest Service's public outing of its concerns with the military takeover. The agency says Collins' push will cast aside 60 years of cooperation with the military over the land and that any changes should be hashed out by the two sides and not in Congress.\nThe Army, meanwhile, is firmly backing the land transfer as it heads toward the Senate. Maj. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the commanding general of Fort Benning, wrote a letter to Collins aide Vernon Robinson saying: \"I greatly appreciate the legislation and your willingness to assist the Army.\"\nThe opposition to the Army move can seem perplexing in a region that has always had strong ties to the military. Dahlonega, a roughly 20-minute trip down the road, is home to the Military College of Georgia, and uniformed soldiers stroll side-by-side with tourists in the town square.\nBut the respect for the military is running up against something equally fierce. The hikers and bikers who flock to the area cherish the relative calm of the woods and worry about smacking into a military transport or happening across target practice at the wrong time.\nSomething that cropped up in a dozen interviews with opponents is a fear that the Army is building the foundation for a vast new base in the forest. David Govus, a 67-year-old retired grading contractor who lives nearby, uses the term \"mission creep,\" a reference to military missions that have steadily expanded in scope.\n\"Listen, I've never served. And I'm not anti-military. But enough is enough,\" said Govus. \"They've got huge military bases all over the country. So what gives? Why do they need more land?\"\nThe answer from supporters: It's not the land they need, but the right to improve it without Forest Service approval. Collins said the Forest Service has delayed projects such as tree trimming and sewer maintenance for additional studies that have cost taxpayers at least $3 million.\nThe Forest Service said it did not know where that figure came from. Judy Toppins, public affairs officer for the Chattahoochee National Forest, said, \"Our employees work efficiently and diligently to meet (the Army's) sometimes complex needs.\"\nThe two government departments could have agreed to a land swap, and Collins said they were close last year, when the Forest Service could have scored some prime property bordering Lake Lanier. But Collins said the Army balked when the Forest Service asked for an additional $10 million to pay for buildings on the new property.\nToppins said negotiations fell apart because the swap was not \"mutually beneficial.\" She said the Forest Service has no official position on the Collins bill but wants to work out a deal under existing law.\nToppins"}

Madhusudhan said that the two varsities had framed 70 to 80 statutes without seeking the approval of the legislature.\nRangappa and Krishnan were first summoned by the committee in the month of January, after a privilege motion was moved by MLCs Arun Shahapur and Ganesh Karnik against UoM and KSOU on November 11, 2015."}

In his new book, The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe, Brown University physics professor Stephon Alexander argues that using music as an analogy can shed light on some of the deepest mysteries in cosmology.\nAlexander is not your typical physicist. Born in Trinidad and raised in the Bronx, he developed twin passions for jazz and physics at an early age. As a graduate student, he played the saxophone in jazz clubs and mastered Einstein\u2019s equations. It\u2019s a unique perspective that informs his approach to both; for instance, he views John Coltrane\u2019s seminal Giant Steps album (1960), with its trademark \u201csheets of sound,\u201d as the \u201csonic equivalent to Einstein\u2019s bending of the space-time fabric.\u201d Gizmodo caught up with Alexander to learn more about this hidden link.\nGizmodo: In some sense, this is the perfect timing for a book about the jazz of physics. There\u2019s a lot of interest in sonification\u2014turning raw scientific data into sound\u2014both for creating unusual music, and as a unique means of spotting elusive patterns in the data. The LIGO collaboration just detected gravitational waves and turned that data into an audible \u201cchirp.\u201d We\u2019re now listening to, as well as looking at, our world.\nStephon Alexander: Exactly. I believe that by reconnecting the disciplines of physics and music though analogy, we can begin to understand physics through sound. The universe has sound waves: harmony and resonance are universal phenomena that can be used to explain the dynamics of the early universe. When you hear it, it doesn\u2019t sound musical. But [with sonification] you are informing that raw sound data with the question of the science at hand, and you\u2019re using that to guide you to something new.\nThen there\u2019s the reverse of that. From a musical perspective, I can take my understanding of the physics of the cosmic microwave background radiation, for instance, or the raw sound map that we get from the WMAP data [from NASA\u2019s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe], and tweak that to make it musical. I\u2019m working on a jazz album right now using some of the concepts in the book.\nYou write about how models of neural circuitry in the brain ended up informing your research on superconductivity and the large-scale structure of the universe when you were a graduate student in Leon Cooper\u2019s group at Brown University. That\u2019s a strong argument for understanding the math: it can reveal hidden corrections.\nAlexander: It\u2019s at the heart of my book. You see the wave equation in string theory, you see it in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and you see it in a guitar string. That equation applies to all these very different things that seem to have nothing to do with each other. The math is the connective tissue. There\u2019s an intuitive aspect to physics; sometimes you have to make these crazy leaps. One of the thing I do [as a physicist] is try to make connections between things that people never thought to connect. If there\u2019s something to it, the math will tell the truth. Some hidden equation will connect those things.\nString theory in particular seems to resonate with people because of the musical analogy: our universe is \u201ccomposed\u201d of these tiny strings that make up matter at the most fundamental scale, and the different ways that they vibrate determine the properties of elementary particles and fundamental forces.

In defeating the efforts of Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Tom Price and Donald Trump to dump ObamaCare and replace it with a slimmed-down, more intelligent and flexible program, they have given Democrats incalculable ammunition to make that case.\nIt\u2019s not the first time. Over the past several years the House voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of ObamaCare, a gesture both pointless and borderline absurd; President Obama was never going to sign legislation dooming his legacy achievement, even if somehow the measure made it through the Senate. But it sure made House Republicans feel good about themselves.\nNow that they actually have a chance to do something meaningful \u2013 repeal the taxes and fees that are the undercarriage of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 they can\u2019t make it to the finish line.\nNumber One: Conservatives are not in the majority in the United States. If they were, Evan McMullin would be president.\nNumber Two: The country does not want to return to the pre-ACA era. President Obama produced a monstrous piece of legislation, which was doomed by its excessive mandates and its inability to attract young, healthy patients. But the bill itself is not Obama\u2019s legacy. Rather, he will be credited with changing the country\u2019s viewpoint on universal health care. Few Americans today think we should be the rare developed nation that fails to provide medical services to every citizen.\nNumber Three: Crafting a compromise health care bill that will safeguard popular provisions that President Trump vowed to keep, like protections for those with preexisting conditions or the ability to keep children up to the age of 26 on their parent\u2019s insurance, is not easy.\nThe ACA is something of a mess, and the scoring received by the CBO reflects its shortcomings. But there is more to follow, such as allowing insurers to compete across state lines, which will make it better.\nThe Senate, too, will have a chance to weigh in.\nThe vote, in other words, is not strictly on the ACA, but on a process which will lead to an improvement over the status quo. The bill as it now stands is imperfect, but it\u2019s better than ObamaCare.\nThe Freedom Caucus and others opposing the ACA must accept that the push for this bill is bigger than their principles and it is bigger than health care.\nThis is a battle to establish the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. Never in our country\u2019s history has a duly elected president faced such opposition \u2013 from his political opponents and from different voices in his own party. And also perhaps, from the country\u2019s intelligence services.\nThe United States has entered a danger zone, where trust in our political leaders and our institutions has plummeted. The only way out is for President Trump to follow through on the promises he made to voters, promises which will put the country back on track.\nBut, it all starts here. If the health care bill does not pass because of resistance within his own party, the president will be gravely wounded.\nSince other measures, and most especially tax reform, are backed up behind the ACA, it is quite possible that the reckless behavior of the Freedom Caucus will derail the Trump train.\nThat would be a disaster.

It looks like an oven, and deposits sugar layer by layer in a tray, then melts the parts intended for the sculpture with water so they solidify much like sugar in a bowl will harden with moisture.\nInk can be selectively added to the water so the sculptures come out in full color - a feature sure to set the minds of wedding and party planners spinning. Next to the geometric sculptures was a wedding cake supported by a delicate lattice-work tower of sugar that would be nearly impossible to make by conventional means.\nOh, and the printer can print in chocolate too.\n3D Systems Inc., a Rock Hill, S.C., company, expects to sell the full-color printer for about $10,000 in the latter half of this year, and a monochrome version for half that price.\nLast year, there were only a handful of 3-D printing companies at the gadget show. This year, there were thirty, and the organizers had to turn others away because they couldn't fit them in. The 3-D printing area of the show floor drew dense crowds that gawked at the printers and their creations, which ranged from toys to tea cups to iPhone cases.\nMelissa Spencer, a jewelry designer from Los Angeles, was at the show to look for a printer. 3-D printers have been used in jewelry-making for a long time, but high prices and poor resolution have limited their use. With prices down and output quality up, it's now possible for an independent designer to buy her own printer, Spencer said.\nThe printers focus bright ultraviolet light into liquid resin, setting it. That takes time. One printer maker cited 7 hours for a batch of five rings. The plastic pieces are then used to create molds for molten silver, gold or platinum.\nSpencer is now toying with the idea of abandoning the reuse of molds, and instead using the power of a 3-D printer to make every piece a one-off, unique design, customized to the buyer. It helps that she can show the plastic prototypes to the customer before casting.\nWith 3-D printing, \"we're moving to a world of mass customization,\" said Shawn Dubravac, an analyst for the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the show. What started with custom-printed t-shirts a la CafePress can now happen in all kinds of industries, he added. It's still a small field, though. He expects that just under 100,000 3-D printers will be sold in 2014.\nOne jewelry company was at CES to demonstrate how it has taken the capabilities of the 3-D printer and made them the core of its business. American Pearl, a family-owned company founded in 1950, in November revamped its website to allow shoppers to order custom jewelry. From about 1,000 basic designs, the buyers can change metals and stones and order engravings and they can see the results rendered"}

The report is said to have so upset the then CIA director, Stansfield Turner, that he reportedly asked his staff: \"Are we in UFOs?\"\nThe answer was yes - since the late 1940s, apparently. But exactly how, what, when, why and who remained layered in mystery, leaving grist for the conspiracy mill.\nBut this year a raft of newly unclassified CIA documents revealed that the remote possibility of alien invasion elicited greater fear than the threat of a Soviet nuclear attack.\nMore interesting still, the CIA documents show that despite decades of repeated public denials, behind the scenes there raged a series of inter-agency feuds that involved the highest levels of the US government.\nThe subject of UFOs - and dabbling in psychological warfare techniques - not only focused the attention of the US government elite for 50 years, but of some of the greatest scientific and military minds of the era.\nThroughout the 1950s CIA files clearly document an explosion of activity by US intelligence and military bodies concerned with studying every possible implication for the US, and other Western democracies, of UFOs. The phenomenon, so adored by the cinematic world, was reflected in the CIA's fixations. Indeed, while highly educated CIA employees experimented by giving each other surprise LSD trips in 1953, there were others, in other parts of the agency, dealing with a flood of UFO reports.\nBut significantly, after a burst of intense scrutiny in the early '50s, the available documents effectively go cold. Why? The Kafkaesque explanation provided is that few files were kept because these would only confirm that the CIA was investigating UFOs. A 1995 CIA review stated: \"There was no formal or official UFO project within the agency in the '80s, and agency officials purposely kept files on UFOs to a minimum to avoid creating records that might mislead the public if released.\"\nBut the wildly eclectic UFO files cover everything from \"flying saucers over Belgian Congo uranium mines\" to Nazi \"flying saucers\".\nA 1953 memo shows that the physicist John Wheeler, while critically involved with Edward Teller in the creation of the hydrogen bomb, was available to the \"CIA attack on the flying saucer\" problem. The urgency of the H-bomb race was his priority, but he \"would be pleased at any time to discuss the issue briefly\", the memo said.\nWheeler recommended two \"foreign nationals\" who could help with the \"problem\", including the \"mysterious problems of ion paths and magnetic focusing\" and \"cosmological electrodynamics\".\nA secret 1995 report was titled: CIA's role in the study of UFOs 1947-90: a diehard issue. Collated and written by Gerald Haines, the CIA's National Reconnaissance Office historian, its detailed summary of CIA involvement inadvertently undermined its \"UFOs-don't-exist\" conclusion.

A third senator, Connecticut\u2019s Joe Lieberman, will announce his plans tomorrow, but The New York Times and other outlets are reporting that he is likely to retire as well.\nMy focus, naturally, is in figuring out who their successors might be. We discussed Hutchison\u2019s case last week, so let\u2019s look at North Dakota and Connecticut now.\nGetting the lay of the land in an open race for a United States Senate seat is not terribly complicated. We essentially want to look at three factors: the national partisan environment, the local partisan environment, and the quality of the potential candidates.\nAny guess as to what the national environment will look like in November 2012 would be highly speculative. Yes, Barack Obama\u2019s approval ratings are up slightly. But historically, there has been almost no correlation between what a President\u2019s standing looks like at this stage in the political cycle, and what it will look like the following November. Almost no pollsters, meanwhile (other than Rasmussen Reports, which has some kinks to work out) have yet issued generic ballot polls.\nWe can perhaps come to some conclusions, however, about factors more specific to North Dakota and Connecticut, respectively.\nNorth Dakota has a Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of R+10, which means that in an average year the Republican candidate for president will win 10 percent more of its vote there than he would in the country as a whole. So, for instance, in a year in which the Democratic and Republican candidates each received 50 percent of the vote nationwide, North Dakota would give the Republican 60 percent, and the Democrat 40 percent, all else being equal.\nThat\u2019s a powerful advantage for Republicans: what amounts to a 20-point head start given average candidates in an average year. In fact, even in a good Democratic year, in which Democrats led the generic ballot by 10 points nationally, the Republican would still probably be favored.\nThis indicator, Partisan Voting Index, is based on presidential voting: is there any reason to conclude that voting for the Congress is systematically different? I looked at this in some detail last year and came to the conclusion that the only demographic variable that is of much help in addition to PVI in predicting the outcome of Congressional races is income: poorer states and districts tend to vote a little bit more Democratic for Congress races than they do for the Presidency, and vice versa. North Dakota is slightly poorer than average, so this helps Democrats a bit (under the alternative version of PVI that I use, which I call Partisan Propensity Index, it rates as more like a R+9 than an R+10). Still, this is a minor difference and it remains strongly Republican territory.\nBut systematic differences \u2014 those which you might divine by building a statistical model \u2014 are one thing: there could also be localized differences that are peculiar to one state or region. North Dakota, for instance, despite having voted Republican for President every year since 1964, has frequently elected Democrats to the Congress (the same is true for South Dakota). Is there something particular about the state\u2019s political culture that begets such outcomes?\nI am skeptical about this, because there is not much of a tradition \u2014 as there is"}

The global investment bank said that that negotiations are only just beginning, and that it expects to settle at \"materially lower amounts,\" consistent with outcomes of rival banks that have previously settled with the DOJ.\nTalks of a large settlement with the DOJ couldn't come at a worse time for Deutsche Bank. Weak profitability has cratered the share price, and a $14 billion fine is extraordinary relative to the bank's $18 billion market cap and shareholder equity (about $74 billion as of June 30, 2016).\nDeutsche Bank will likely settle for less than the $14 billion starting point. Remember, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), whose Countrywide operation was a particularly bad actor in mortgages prior to the crisis, settled with the DOJ for a record amount of $16.65 billion. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) settled for $2.6 billion, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) settled for $5.06 billion.\nA reasonable figure might be in the neighborhood of Goldman Sachs' and Morgan Stanley's settlements, rather than Bank of America's extraordinarily large settlement. The Wall Street Journal reported that Deutsche Bank had about 5.5 billion euro (about $6.2 billion) in litigation reserves as of June 30, and that at least one analyst believed the settlement would be in the range of $4 billion.

During the display, the green-backed, red-throated, green-headed birds fly rapidly to a height of 100 feet or more and then execute looping dives at speeds of more than 50 mph. When they reach the bottom of their dive, they round upward near a rival, threat or perching female \u2014 in this study's case, a stuffed dummy or a live caged female \u2014 and make a loud, high-pitched chirp or beep.\nThe research was more adventuresome than you might think.\nOften people walked dogs off-leash at the park, so \"our field notes are filled with muddy paw prints from dogs who ran up to say hi,\" Feo recalled. Clark added, \"I had a guy who tried to steal one of my cameras, and I had to chase him down. We picked a field site we could reach by bus \u2014 if I had a car, we probably would've picked a site less well-used by people.\"\nThe scientists' video revealed that the sound a male makes coincides with a 60-millisecond flaring of his tail feathers \u2014 roughly as fast as a blink of an eye. Wind tunnel tests confirmed the bird's outer tail feathers vibrate like a clarinet's reed, at a frequency like the highest note on a piano, four octaves above middle C. The bird's split-second tail spread while diving therefore produces a loud, brief sound resembling a chirp or a beep.\n\"Just blowing outward on the tail feather makes the same frequency as in the dive,\" said Feo, who plays clarinet in the University of California Marching Band.\nTo confirm these results, Feo captured males and plucked or trimmed their tail feathers, knowing the birds can fly without them and that they typically grow back in five weeks. Males missing the outer pair of five pairs of tail feathers, or those with the inner vanes of the outer feathers trimmed, could not make the sounds.\nClark emphasized the tail-feather sound is not a whistle. A whistling sound is made as air moves through a tight space, as in a teakettle, or over a rigid edge, as with a classic pennywhistle. The dive sound, on the other hand, is made by the fluttering vane of a feather.\n\"Most have funny tail feathers with tapered or narrow tips, all have mating dives, and all make a different sound,\" Clark said. \"It's possible that sexual preference by females has caused the shape of the tail feathers, and thus the sound, to diverge, thereby driving the evolution of new species.\"\nFor decades"}

They also include a controversial city bond structure, reliance on money from a city-owned casino and legalized recreational marijuana that would need approval in Springfield.\nAsked afterward why he waited so long to make his proposal and why he thinks the next occupant of the mayor\u2019s office will listen, Emanuel argued he has been trying to cope with the looming problem since he took office. And without naming his predecessor Mayor Richard M. Daley, Emanuel contrasted his approach with the prior administration\u2019s, saying it\u2019s \u201cthe responsible thing to do\u201d to leave the next mayor some possible solutions.\nWhat won\u2019t work, Emanuel said, is the \u201ctax the wealthy\u201d mindset embraced by the ascendant progressive wing of the Democratic Party that could take an increasingly central role in charting the city\u2019s future after he steps down.\nThat assessment came despite Emanuel saying in his speech that while there is \u201cno single solution\u201d to the impending payment cliff, the city\u2019s response \u201cmust be based on progressive principles.\u201d Instead, Emanuel positioned himself as the pro-pension realist in a world that\u2019s very different from 1970, when the Illinois Constitution, which says pension benefits \u201cshall not be diminished or impaired,\u201d was adopted.\nBut Pritzker threw cold water on the constitutional amendment idea, which is opposed by powerful public-sector unions whose members would take the financial hit if their benefits were decreased.\n\u201cMy commitment is to pay the pensions that are owed to people.

She did not say where he died.\nShevardnadze swept heroically across the international stage in the final years of the Soviet empire, helping topple the Berlin Wall and end the Cold War, but as the leader of post-Soviet Georgia his career in the public eye ended in humiliation and he was chased out of his parliament and forced into retirement..\nAs Soviet foreign minister, the white-haired man with a gravelly voice was the diplomatic face of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika. Following the wooden Andrei Gromyko, Shevardnadze impressed Western leaders with his charisma, his quick wit and his commitment to Gorbachev\u2019s reform course.\n\u201cHe made a large contribution to the foreign affairs policy of perestroika, and he was a true supporter of new thinking in global affairs,\u201d Gorbachev told Interfax Monday.\nShevardnadze helped push through the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989, signed landmark arms control agreements, and helped negotiate German reunification in 1990 \u2014 a development that Soviet leaders had long feared and staunchly opposed.\nWestern leaders, especially Germans, would remain grateful for Shevardnadze\u2019s work as foreign minister. But in the former Soviet Union, those nostalgic for a return to superpower status lumped Shevardnadze with Gorbachev in the ranks of the unpardonable.\nShevardnadze resigned in December 1990, warning that reform was collapsing and dictatorship was imminent. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed in the wake of an attempted hard-line coup against Gorbachev.\nShevardnadze returned to Georgia after its first elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was ousted in a coup in 1992; Shevardnadze was elected speaker of parliament and became the country\u2019s leader. Gamsakhurdia died under mysterious circumstances in 1993, and Shevardnadze was elected president for a five-year term in 1995 after the country adopted a new constitution.\nHe survived two assassination attempts, including an assault on his motorcade with anti-tank weapons. Many observers suggested the attacks blunted Shevardnadze\u2019s reformist impulses and left him interested only in holding onto power. Although he had pursued a pro-Western policy, Georgia under Shevardadze became plagued by corruption and a deterioration of democracy.\nIn November 2003, massive demonstrations that became known as the Rose Revolution erupted after allegations of widespread fraud in a parliamentary election. Police maintained a low profile \u2014 Shevardnadze later said he feared any police action against the demonstrators would lead to terrible bloodshed. After three weeks, protesters led by future president Mikhail Saakashvili broke into a parliament session where Shevardnadze was speaking and drove him out of the building.\nShevardnadze was born on Jan. 25, 1928, in the village of Mamati near Georgia\u2019s Black Sea coast, the fifth and final child in a rural family that hoped he would become a doctor.

It also has a $500,000 line of credit through BancorpSouth that will be due in June, which the board wants to refinance.\nA shelter donor previously said the loan was discovered after an interest payment sum of nearly $9,000 appeared on 2018 shelter financial reports.\nThe source said they addressed this issue with board members and was told former shelter director Joe Sprague took out the loan after the board advised him not to. The bank allegedly approved the request without any additional signatories, and the board desired to keep the loan secret, the source said.\nShelter Board President Sam Terry refuted this claim, saying the issue was discussed and approved by the board two years ago.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to hide,\u201d Terry said Monday.\nThe loan was obtained to cover costs at the shelter, Terry said. According to minutes from a special meeting Feb. 1, 2017, this was justified due to a need for new doors, renovated puppy area, replacing kennels, adding kennels, clinic upgrades and a new building for more than 30 dogs, among other requests.\nIt was approved by an email vote of 9-1 for BancorpSouth on Feb. 3, 2017. Terry abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest.\nThe meeting minutes say BancorpSouth approved the loan of $500,000 with first-year interest only and a rate of 1.25 percent. The closing fee is listed at $500.\n\u201cThey are setting the loan to mature in 2019, which we can pay it off with the trust money we will receive, or we could convert it to a 15-year loan,\u201d the minutes say.\nBoard member Darren Minor and Vice President William Buckley moved to take BancorpSouth\u2019s loan option, rather than the trust option, which was unanimously approved with Terry abstaining.\nA second loan from another financial institution was also considered. The final offer was worth $450,000 with first-year interest only, interest rate of 0.25 percent and closing cost of $200.

Quinnipiac placed in the top 10 in the nation for most of the year, ending with a No. 8 ranking for the NCAA Tournament. After being predicted to finish No. 7/No. 8 in the ECAC Hockey in the preseason polls, it earned a share of the Cleary Cup for finishing as the regular season conference champions, and was awarded the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament.\nBut it was a tough last stretch for the Bobcats. They were upset in the quarterfinals of the ECAC Hockey by Brown and then didn\u2019t make the Frozen Four in the NCAA Tournament. And there\u2019s a pretty clear reason as to why this team was impacted late in the season \u2013 the absence of injured senior defenseman Brandon Fortunato.\nFortunato was injured during a practice in early February that sidelined him for the rest of the year. He was one of the top point scorers on the team and was at the helm of the power play unit that was one of the deadliest in the nation before going down with the leg injury. Fortunato left a void that wasn\u2019t able to be filled.\nTo put Fortunato\u2019s value perspective, he still managed to finish fourth on the team in points with 28 and second on the team in assists with 23 \u2013 despite missing the final 12 games of the season.\nAfter that came more losses on the defensive end. Senior defensemen Chase Priskie and Luke Shiplo both received suspensions in the final game of the regular season against Yale. Each were out in game one against Brown and Priskie was out for game two as well.\nBut let\u2019s look at the positives. And boy, there are a lot.\nOne of the biggest reasons for the success of the team was junior goaltender Andrew Shortridge. He concluded the season with an 18-7-2 record and four shutouts. He led the nation in save percentage with a .940 and was second in goals against with a 1.51. Shortridge is also a finalist for the Mike Richter award, an honor given to the nation\u2019s best collegiate goaltender.\nThe game against Minnesota-Duluth marked the final game for Shortridge as a Bobcat. On Tuesday, April 2, it was announced that he had signed an entry-level contract with the San Jose Sharks. Junior defenseman Brogan Rafferty won\u2019t be returning to the Bobcats either, as he signed a one-year entry level contract with the Vancouver Canucks on Monday, April 1.\nJunior defenseman Karlis Cukste may also opt to leave a year early. Cukste is a draft pick of the San Jose Sharks, so he could be joining Shortridge on the west coast.\nFor the returners, there\u2019s a big group of freshmen and sophomores that have used this season to progress their game, most notably the freshmen.

Homebuyers across the country are being targeted in custom-tailored email scams aimed at stealing down payments. And the worst part isn't losing years of savings. The scammers depend on you to send them your money.\nForget about anonymous emails promising sweepstakes wins or pleas from Nigerian princes looking to get millions out of their country. This is phishing with an IQ.\nThese emails are designed to electronically hijack the homebuying process at the most critical moment, just before closing. They go after specific individuals \u2014 typically buyers \u2014 by adopting the names and titles of real-estate agents, mortgage officials and title agents involved in legitimate transactions.\nThe FBI says the scams are among the biggest on the internet. They hit hundreds of people each year and cost Americans tens of millions of dollars. The mortgage industry also recognizes the damage the scams have caused and warns buyers and sellers explicitly how to guard against them.\nWhen first-time homebuyer Jack Padden replied to an email on the eve of closing, he set off a cascade of events that would cost him his down payment and force him to cancel his purchase.\nThe financial chaos didn't end there. Heather Murphy was depending on the sale of her house to Padden to buy a new one in central Phoenix. Her possessions were packed, movers were hired and closing was scheduled for the next day when she learned the sale was scotched.\n\"When I found out, I had to run down the hall and throw up,\" Murphy said. \"The only thing that wasn't packed was the food in my pantry and my refrigerator.\"\nCollateral damage on the single transaction could have cost tens of thousands of dollars in lost deposits, salaries and fees.\nMurphy stood to lose $4,000 in earnest money she had put down on her new home. Real-estate agents on both ends of the transaction would not get paid. Title companies would not collect fees. Banks would not process mortgage loans.\nThe FBI says fake real-estate emails are a large component of so-called Business E-mail Compromise Scams, which cost victims worldwide more than $5.3 billion from 2013-2016.

Some members of the United Nations Security Council are eager to find a resolution. The new US Ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, has a Dayton-like task ahead of him in forging a compromise.\nAnd Iraq's people remain squeezed between tough international sanctions and a dictator unwilling to meet UN demands or divert military spending to help save Iraqi children.\nAny resolution will require compromise. For starters, Iraq could stop aiming missiles and antiaircraft fire at Western jets patrolling the no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. Thus it could avoid the bombing runs that, so far this year, equal two-thirds of the number of missions flown against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict.\nWhen the air war ceases, the US, UN, and Iraq could hammer out a way to resume the weapons inspections halted by Saddam last year. This would restart the process of fulfilling the Security Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. Then the sanctions would eventually be lifted.\nWhy should things come in this order, rather than the US and Britain simply calling off their jets, dismantling the no-fly zones, and allowing the Iraqis to get back to normal life?\nBecause Iraq remains a country gripped by a regime that has invaded one neighbor, waged an eight-year war against another, repressed its own people, and developed capabilities to build and launch chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. It can't simply be sighed over and allowed to go on its way - no matter how disturbing conditions in Iraq, or how much the Russians want full oil exports resumed so Baghdad can repay old debts to Moscow.\nSaddam is counting on the West to suffer \"Iraq fatigue.\" The US, instead, should initiate a diplomatic offensive to revive the inspections. A resolution to that effect, sponsored by Britain and the Netherlands, is already before the Security Council. The \"carrot\" for Iraq is a commitment to start loosening sanctions as soon as an agreement is reached. A first step might be expansion of the oil-for-food program already in place. Further loosening would hinge on subsequent Iraqi cooperation with UN inspectors.\nSaddam may want no part of any agreement that dims his dreams of military glory. And the hope of better lives for his people appears not to move him. Just recently a ship seized as it was leaving Iraq was found to contain consumer products, including baby food, which are in notoriously short supply inside the country. That undercut Iraq's claim of hardship from sanctions.\nSaddam should be served notice, yet again, that the will to hold him to the disarmament obligations he signed in 1991 won't fade away."}

The idea is to reduce those incidents.\nThe act would pay for 15 employees at the Department of Education to lead that work. Those employees would help school districts with prevention programs and help coordinate schools with mental and behavioral health care providers. It would also help school and education service districts to establish teams to assess threats to student safety.\nThose teams would, under the proposed law, also develop intervention plans and connect students and families with local resources and support.\nIn an interview, state Sen. Rob Wagner, D-Lake Oswego, the chair of the Senate Education Committee, said lawmakers should check back in next year to see whether those measures are effective.\nThe proposal has broad backing, from pediatricians to police and Gov. Kate Brown. It\u2019s the product of years of work by a group of police, educators and mental health experts under the auspices of a gubernatorial task force on school safety.\nSome advocates and lawmakers question the finer points of the program, though.\nSarah Lochner, deputy director of government relations for Multnomah County, worried how the state would prevent kids of color from being targeted by the program.\nIn 2018, the federal Government Accountability Office found that in public schools, black students, boys and students with disabilities were significantly more likely to be suspended or expelled.\nState Rep. Cheri Helt, R-Bend, a longtime Bend-La Pine School Board member until last month, was moved to tears by the testimony on Wednesday.

Therefore, in order that this task can be implemented successfully, I need full support from all levels of society. I expect the support of all the Indonesian people so that together we can come out from the crisis, which we have been facing and which has almost paralyzed all aspects of our national life.\nThe struggle of the students in accelerating the process of reform constitutes a fresh breeze blowing into the 21st century. I seriously give my attention to the dynamics of the aspirations that are developing for the implementation of comprehensive reforms, expressed by students and intellectuals, or which are developing in the society and in the circle of the House of Representatives. I see those aspirations as improvements in political life that are in line with the demands of the times and of generations, a Government that is clean and free from inefficiency and practice of corruption, collusion and nepotism, as well as an economic life that provides fairer opportunities for business.\nTherefore I wish to pledge my commitment to these aspirations of the people to undertake gradual and constitutional reforms in all sectors by restoring the socioeconomic life, enhancing democratic political life in line with the demands of the times and generations and upholding legal certainties in accordance with Pancasila [the Five Principles of Indonesia's state ideology] and the 1945 Constitution.\nBased on that, I will immediately form a Cabinet that is in line with the demands of time, the aspirations and the wishes of the people, that is, a professional Cabinet that has a high dedication and integrity.\n1. In the political field, among others, by updating various laws as part of the framework of enhancing the quality of political life nuanced by general elections as contained in the General State Policy Guidelines.\n2. In the legal field, among others, by reviewing the law on subversion.\n3. In the economic field, by accelerating the completion of laws to abolish practices of monopoly and unhealthy competition.\nBesides that, the Government will give special attention to the state budget, the revitalization of the national banking and financial institutions and programs that concern the interests of the people. Besides that, the Government will continue to carry out all commitments that it has made with foreign parties, especially in implementing the economic reform program in line with the agreement with the I.M.F.\nThe Government will continue to uphold regional and international cooperation as has been carried out so far. . . .\nRealizing these heavy and noble tasks, I will, with all humility, open myself to all input and criticism from the people to accelerate the reform process toward the prosperity of the nation and the state, as we have aimed for together. To attain these noble ideals I, once again, would hope for the full support from all sides.\nTo all the nation, let us all end the conflicts within us so that we can make use of this very limited time effectively in the framework of settling the crisis we are now facing.\nFinally, allow me"}

Their incomes haven\u2019t kept pace with our tender feelings.\nWe gawk at athletes, entertainers and talentless, generic celebrities. We might even envy them, but we don\u2019t give them unmitigated respect and confidence. Trust in the clergy, members of Congress, journalists and big business people has crashed since the 1970s.\nI can\u2019t recall learning about heroes of commerce in school. Inventors such as Thomas Edison were heroes because of their brains and contributions, not their eventual fortunes.\nWe did learn about great moguls such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford, but we also learned about the downside of the Industrial Revolution and labor movement. It wasn\u2019t hero worship.\nI can\u2019t recall any great admiration for the biggest self-made zillionaires when I was in high school and college in the 1970s \u2014 except for maybe Hugh Hefner, who my pals probably did worship. Howard Hughes was certainly famous, but he was loopy by then. But people like J. Paul Getty, Daniel Ludwig and John D. MacArthur were more secretive villains than role models. There were no man-child billionaires.\nThere was still a 1960s anti-materialism in the air. In college and graduate school, kids didn\u2019t talk much about becoming an entrepreneur or wanting to start a business. Some people wanted to, of course. But it was distinctly uncool to confess to greed or wanting to make a lot of money.\nThe big change started somewhere in the middle 1980s. Sam Walton and then Warren Buffet were folksy, fatherly, friendly moguls. Ted Turner was a swashbuckling, irreverent financial delinquent. Celebrity culture expanded to commerce and Forbes began listing the richest of the rich.\nThe archetypal new era entrepreneurs were the twin lords of tech, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. They had compelling stories: outsiders, dropouts, incredible focus and brilliance, inventors, not just businessmen. They weren\u2019t the establishment.\nThey paved the way for our glorification of classic entrepreneurs but also for a new class of financial celebrity \u2014 the wizard of hedge funds and private equity.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wall St. was stained. When Michael Douglas\u2019 Gordon Gekko said, \u201cGreed is good\u201d in the 1987 movie \u201cWall Street,\u201d it was evil. Gates and Jobs came to represent a different narrative. They flipped \u201cgreed is good\u201d into a virtue in a way Ayn Rand\u2019s disciples never could.\nThe entrepreneurial knight created not only new things but new ways of doing things \u2014 and of thinking. The entrepreneur was a builder, a creator, a disruptor and a do-gooder.\nAnd some are. Others aren\u2019t. The distribution of human virtues and vices doesn\u2019t vary much from among groups and fields in my experience.\nOverall, the new mythology of entrepreneurship is probably a good thing. At its best, it is optimistic, assertive, rebellious and bound for solutions. It is chock-full of old American memes \u2014 self-made, self-reliant and independent by declaration.

But Roach has been quietly remaking his image in recent years, directing well-received HBO political films like Recount and Game Change, along with the classy 2015 biopic Trumbo.

In my small town, we didn\u2019t have too many hipsters or soccer moms gracing our graveled drive-through: this is the Klamath Basin, and my clientele were hay haulers, gravel truck drivers, ranchers, dairy farmers and ranch hands. These were kind and hard-working men and women \u2013 the kind of men who tip their hats when they meet a lady and the tough gals who can raise four kids and bale hay all summer while they\u2019re at it. I remember their faces so well: the hay-hauler who always had an encouraging word and a generous tip for me, the cattle rancher with a fondness for our \u201ccowboy cookies\u201d, the dairy owner who came through at least once a week and bought a staggering number of mochas for his entire milking crew, the flatbeds piled high with irrigation lines or tractor parts, driven by community-minded folks, never too busy to buy a coffee, help a neighbor or shoot the breeze for a moment.\nOn Monday, those trucks and tractors that I saw so often as a youngster paraded through downtown Klamath Falls Oregon (225 of them, at last count!) but they were not loaded with hay, cattle, potatoes, fresh milk or irrigation line. They were covered in homemade signs and hauling the children of fourth and fifth generation farmers, begging anyone to notice their hard work and allow them the freedom to continue. They looked vaguely uncomfortable \u2013 these aren\u2019t activists or excitable sign-carriers, and one older gentleman in a tattered ball cap even held up a hand-painted sign reading, \u201cI\u2019d rather be ranching\u201d.\nSo what drove these men and women from their cows, fields, truck stops and mechanic shops? The Klamath Basin Water Crisis.\nThousands of small, family-owned farms and ranches have had their irrigation water rights cut off in the last couple of weeks, devaluing their land, forcing many of them to sell cattle, stop harvesting, cease production and fear for the future of their families.\nWater rights are a complicated issue, even for those who are familiar with the workings of rural life \u2013 and this case is no exception. Here are the basics: the Klamath Tribes and the environmental activists have teamed up to starve farmers and ranchers out of the Klamath Basin, because of the lives of the supposedly endangered sucker fish in Upper Klamath Lake, and the Coho Salmon of the Klamath River. Because the tribes have been in the Klamath Basin since \u201ctime immemorial\u201d, a judge recently ruled that their water rights supersede those of the Klamath County Agriculturalists. What are the tribes doing with these newfound rights? Turning off water to agriculture, the main industry of Klamath County (plus a threat to refuse multi-use water to Crater Lake National Park, the only National Park in Oregon and a revenue generator of more than $30 million for Klamath county and the surrounding area last year) and letting thousands of gallons of economic and cultural force drain to the ocean instead.\nIt\u2019s not that farmers and ranchers are eager to see fish gasping for air on the banks of the river, or that they don\u2019t want to have healthy rivers and wetlands. Agriculture, and small family farms like these in particular, are true stewards of the land, carefully caring for wildlife and natural resources as much as they do their domestic productions."}

Instead, they issue \u201ca qualitative discussion\u201d that weighs major atmospheric factors impacting tropical storm and hurricane development.\n\u201cWe believe that we are still in an active era for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones since 1995 (despite the quiet seasons that occurred in 2013-2014),\u201d Klotzbach and Gray wrote.\nThey said the 2014 season was tamed by a weakening of two phenomena that affect tropical storm development \u2014 one involving the flow of water in the Atlantic, and another impacting sea surface temperatures. They are known as the thermohaline circulation (THC) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).\n\u201cWhile we saw a significant weakening of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) during the spring of 2014, North Atlantic SST [sea surface temperatures] and sea level pressure patterns have since rebounded to conditions characteristic of an active era,\u201d they said.\n\u201cOne of the big uncertainties,\u201d they said, is whether a developing El Ni\u00f1o in the tropical Pacific will continue into next summer. If it does, tropical storm development could once again be limited by such factors as high wind shear, which rips storms apart.\nThey detailed four possible scenarios for the upcoming season. They assigned an 80 percent chance to two of the scenarios \u2014 one being that the THC circulation continues to be above average and no El Ni\u00f1o develops; and the other being that above-average THC circulation continues but a significant El Ni\u00f1o develops.\nConditions described by the first scenario tend to produce 12-15 named storms, seven to nine hurricanes and three to four major hurricanes. The second scenario tends to produce eight to 11 named storms, three to five hurricanes and one or two majors.\nThe two outlying scenarios \u2014 an unusually strong THC circulation and no El Ni\u00f1o; or a weak THC circulation and a strong El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 tend to result in a very active season or a very quiet season, respectively.\nIn the latest report released Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said there was a 65 percent chance that El Ni\u00f1o conditions will develop this winter and last into spring of next year.\nThe first CSU forecast will be released April 9.\nCOLD COMFORT: Let the warm-up begin, but don\u2019t bother breaking out the shorts and T-shirts.

This is art created by local people and is part of a short-term project by the arts council. It is unlikely that the pieces selected for the council chambers would offend those sitting in the room.\n\u201cOur goal is to display artistic works that are representative of the municipality at various public and business locations throughout our community. The selected artwork will be on display from June 26 through Oct. 10. Each piece will be accompanied by a description of how the work relates to the area, an artist\u2019s biography, and a QR code that will enable viewers to access additional information, including a map of all the participating venues, via their smartphones,\u201d arts council representatives Greg Gillespie and Kate Butler wrote to council.\nAs someone who has spent many hours in these meetings, I appreciate those places that feature artwork I can examine while boards and councils tend to administrative items.\nThe HHHS boardrooms have large works of art created locally and they are a pleasure to take in. One of them, like a Rorschach test, gives me something to consider during breaks between meetings, and gives the otherwise bland room a bit of life.\nWhile conversation at council last week questioned the need for art in council chambers, that wasn\u2019t the decision of council. They decided to defer the decision until a later meeting and I think public sentiment will help dictate where they go from here.\nIt is clear that the public wants its government to support the arts in all ways possible and one of those ways is symbolically, through hanging pieces in municipal buildings.\nIt is a fine idea \u2013 one that is inexpensive to conduct and brings only benefit to all who participate.\nMembers of the public, and of council, can see what area artists have to offer, the ambiance will be improved and the artists themselves will have a chance to show off their incredible talents.\nAs was pointed out last week, several businesses have already pioneered this practice.

The new rate will be $13.65/hr for those employees not offered employer-provided health insurance and $12.15/hr for those that are offered employer provided health insurance.\nBy definition, the Living Wage rate is not static. Locally housing cost continue to rise dramatically, which translates to an increase in the cost of living, dictating the rate change. Employers use JE\u2019s rate as the benchmark to set their own minimum wage. JE certified employers are committed to providing a wage that their employees can live on without relying on taxpayer-supported programs or outside help. The true mark of a successful business is not just creating profits alone; that success means employers do not rely on outside agencies to provide food and shelter for their employees.\nJE defines the concept of a living wage as the amount a worker needs to make to meet their basic needs without public or private assistance. The living wage rate sets a standard for a different wage floor. To determine the living wage rate, JE uses the Universal Living Wage formula.\nThe Buncombe County living wage rate is used in both JE\u2019s public policy advocacy and voluntary Living Wage Certification program. The City of Asheville, the towns of Montreat and Weaverville, and Buncombe County all accepted the previous wage rate as a wage floor for policy about public employees. Public agencies using JE\u2019s wage rate are expected to make adjustments at the beginning of their fiscal year.\nWith over 425 employers in the Certification program, JE has the largest network of its kind in the country. The Certification program aims to reward and recognize existing Living Wage Certified Employers, to provide employers with tools and incentives to increase workers\u2019 wages up to a living wage, to connect consumers to employers that provide a living wage, and to promote a just and sustainable local economy. JE, along with two national partners, authored a toolkit for other communities to use in establishing a similar program. As a national leader, JE consults with several communities and organizations. The program is an innovative approach to addressing root causes of poverty.\nLiving Wage Certification is valid for two years before an employer is required to recertify. Business owners due for recertification in 2019 can opt for a two-year certification at the new rate, or utilize the grace period to re-certify at the previous living wage rate for one year. Existing Living Wage Certified Employers have been notified of the wage rate change and will have ample time to make adjustments in their wage scale. ALL employers must make the necessary adjustments by Jan. 1, 2020, and all businesses or organizations applying for Living Wage Certification for the first time in 2019 will be at the new rate.\n\u201cWhile neither the federal government nor the state of North Carolina have raised the minimum wage above $7.25 in a decade, here in Western North Carolina we are working together with employers to establish a wage floor that is more sustainable for workers. Our living wage rate is a better starting place than the minimum wage and we encourage all local employers to join the hundreds of businesses and nonprofits who have voluntarily chosen to raise the wage floor and contribute to a more just and sustainable economic community,\u201d said Vicki Meath, Executive Director of Just Economics.\n\u201cA living wage is one of the best ways to move people out of poverty.

Her character Catherine, the wife of the man who accuses the priest, challenges main character played by Michael Murphy.\nAdding to her English-language resum\u00e9, she also stars in the Montreal-shot Rest Home by Michael Rowe, about a man whose wife has cheated on him. She describes the Canadian-Australian coproduction as a subtle, intense, story without much dialogue in which she plays a Russian woman living with Quebecois guy. Accordingly, she had to not only speak English but with a Russian accent.\nSpeaking of accents, Cl\u00e9ment says she was glad Valine accepted and integrated her French Canadian background into the character for Marlene.\n\"It was difficult because I would have liked my English to have less of an accent but at the time I started working on the project\u2026.and you can't actually want to change your accent and do a character at the same time,\" she said. \"She needed to be very alive and real, and as real as I could make her.\"\nWhat's more, Cl\u00e9ment demonstrated her acting range by shifting from the shy, nervous Kyla (for which she received a nomination for best supporting actress at the Canadian Screen Awards) in Xavier Dolan's Mommy to the extroverted, brash Marlene.

Theatrical witnesses. A very chill bailiff.\nThe scene that played out on Jan. 24 inside Bothell Municipal Court wasn\u2019t a real trial. It was fictitious, with the roles played by students from North Creek High School.\nThe mock trial was the culmination of the intro to law class, where students learn about the criminal justice system. First offered last year, when the new school began operations, the class was the brainchild of teacher Casey Kellogg, assistant principal Sharyn Mehner and Bothell Municipal Court Judge Michelle Gehlsen.\nKellogg said the class offered students an opportunity to gain practical knowledge and think about alternative career paths. The list of guest speakers was exhaustive, including detectives, attorneys, judges, federal agents and a criminal psychologist.\n\u201cOne of the greatest things is students are walking away with empathy for the men and women doing these jobs,\u201d Kellogg said.\nBy the time he assigned the final case, Kellogg said he could step aside and watch the wheels of justice at work. Students selected their roles, studied affidavits, memorized facts and practiced oral arguments.\n\u201cYou never know what to expect,\u201d he said.\nTwo classes were pitted against each other for the mock trial, first period and fourth period. Whoever won would get bragging rights, Kellogg said. It\u2019s a tie if it ends up a hung jury.\nThe case before them was grim. A teenage girl died. Was it a rock climbing accident, or was she murdered by the student she ratted out for cheating on a test?\nThat\u2019s a question that the jury, made up of definitely impartial parents, had to answer. And it was up to students to convince them one way or the other.\nCaden Carlson stands before a stern jury made up of parents during introductory arguments.\nWhen trial time arrived, the courtroom was overflowing with spectators. The hearing was often punctuated with applause and laughter, and attorneys anxiously read from papers they held in their hands. Sometimes, Judge Gehlsen would pooh-pooh the audience for too much chatter.\nThe first witness was there the night the girl died, she said, and the way the suspect was pushing and shoving and yelling at the victim was unsettling.\nShe suspected something fishy. But she didn\u2019t see what happened next. She said she was scared, so she left.\nA medical examiner seemingly bolstered the case: Based on the blunt force trauma to the victim\u2019s head, she was definitely murdered.

{"idx": "36157", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Mobile World Congress 2016 is over, and now the question is which smartphone manufacturer will come out on top as the handsets go on sale. Samsung is leading with its trump cards in the form of the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge. These two smartphones are the dual flagships of the South Korean company's attack on the 2016 smartphone market. Given the falling revenue and profits of the mobile division (in part down to the weak sales and lukewarm critical reception of the S6 family), the Galaxy S7 family has a lot of work to do.\nI've been cautiously optimistic about Samsung's work around the launch of the devices at MWC last month. As more details of the handset come out and the story around the devices that Samsung wants to tell becomes clear, the bullet points the S7 will address are coming in to focus.\nThis is a critical year for Samsung's mobile team. With that in mind, here are the twenty-five reasons why the Galaxy S7 family could win over the smartphone market in 2016?\n1. Samsung's Galaxy S7 is more than a smartphone.\nNote the MWC presentation brought in a standalone 360 degree camera and Samsung's virtual reality headset. The two S7 models are smartphones, but they are being sold as something more than a smartphone - they are the hub of a new wave of desirable technology.\n2. Samsung is not relying on specification Top Trumps.\nThese two handsets may have the latest technology on board with some of the highest specifications on the market, but the reliance on 'the biggest number in everything' is fading away. The focus is less on raw power and more on what an S7 can do for its owner. Real world examples, not abstract numbers, are the touchstones.\n3. The name recognition of SnapDragon.\nThe S6 family fell back on Exynos across the world, and while the numbers game suggests that a bigger SnapDragon system on chip is better there is something more powerful. 'SnapDragon' is one of the few terms that has made the leap into the minds of western smartphone consumers. Shipping with 'SnapDragon On Board' means another recognisable name and increases the comfort levels of consumers looking to buy a new device.\n4. It feels better in the hand and looks easier on the eye.\nThe Galaxy S6 handsets had very angular backs, with hard edges between the bezels and the rear glass. That's no longer the case, with a touch of a curve on the back glass. Coupled with the camera lens assembly sitting almost flush to the back (it juts out by 0.45mm) the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge look much better and have a better tactile feel in the first few moments of picking one up.\n5. The S7 family is for the S5 user.\nGiven the typical two-year product cycle of smartphones (thanks to network contracts) the real goal of the Galaxy S7 is to appeal to the users of the Galaxy S5. Going from the S4 (or the S5) to the S6 saw beloved features removed. That's not the case with the S5 to the S7 upgrade - everything the S5 users loved about their phones can be found in the S7 family.\n6. Lots of battery power.\nStepping up with a 3000 mAh battery, the Galaxy S7 has buckets of energy storage. Couple the larger battery with the optimised code in Android and you have a package that should allow any user to last a full day while using all of the"}

Flathead and Glacier played a five-set nail-biter the first time they met on the south side of Kalispell back in September, and even their match at Glacier last month saw the Wolfpack win game one before Flathead rallied.\nThis time, however, Flathead used a six-point run midway through game one and rallied back from a 5-0 hole in game two to take a commanding lead. Game three did provide some drama as the Wolfpack (10-18) led by as many as five points and even had a 24-22 advantage before Flathead closed the match with a 4-0 surge, capped by a block from Hannah O\u2019Dell and Julia Burden on the final point.\nFlathead started five seniors in the contest but it was Burden, a junior, who led the way statistically. She finished with 10 kills, five in the first game, and added two blocks. Senior Taylor Henley added seven kills and four blocks while classmate Madde Boles put down nine kills of her own.\nGlacier, meanwhile, trotted out a starting seven that featured two juniors, two sophomores and a freshman. The Wolfpack, seeded sixth in the Western Conference, reached Thursday\u2019s match after sweeping Missoula Big Sky two days earlier. Senior Kali Gulick led the Wolfpack with nine kills. Aubrie Rademacher chipped in eight more in a losing effort.\nThe double-elimination Class AA tournament runs Nov. 8-10 at Brick Breeden Fieldhouse in Bozeman.

If that knowledge is a little thin in places, the time between graduation and college enrollment is a good time to increase their knowledge about credit.\nA recent survey by Equifax found that nearly 70% of college students carry at least one credit card. It's a convenient way to cover expenses and emergencies, but if students run up balances they don't pay off each month, they may graduate with crushing credit card debt, to go along with their crushing student loan debt.\nThe first thing parents should stress to their college freshmen -- you have to live within a budget. Whether you are paying for things with cash or a credit card, you can only spend money that you have. When you start spending money you don't have, that's where you run into trouble.\nWhen spending with a credit card, students must pay the bill and pay it on time. Missed or late payments will drag down a credit score.\nMany credit cards have features to help users stay on top of their spending and within budget. Discover's student cards have a Spend Analyzer to track spending and to alert them when they're going overboard in certain categories, like restaurant meals.\nMobile payment and personal finance apps also come with helpful budgeting features. International Business Times recently profiled three -- Venmo, Mint, and Wally. Mint and Wally are personal finance apps that let you set targets for certain categories of spending, then track what you spend. Venmo lets you send money online to friends and family.\nColleges are also beginning to offer more financial counseling for students. The University of California Davis offers 40 money management tips. They include using care when taking out student loans, keeping money in a bank, and creating a spending plan.\nA financially literate college student will probably be a savvy consumer.

We have never been the merchants in society,\" said our Cambodian waiter, explaining the scarcity of Cambodian restaurants here in Los Angeles--or in fact anywhere. \"And,\" he added, \"Cambodian food is usually eaten only at home.\"\nFor over a decade, visits to Cambodia have been forbidden. Today, tourists are finally being permitted to view the fabulous remnants of its ancient civilization--Angkor Thom, the city and the Angkor Wat temple. But they may not stay in the country overnight and the five hours allotted for sight-seeing leave little time to eat. Even if more time were allowed, the lack of native restaurants would make it difficult to sample the local cuisine. Actually, if you want to eat in a Cambodian restaurant, you have as good a chance to do so in Long Beach or San Francisco as anywhere else in the world.\nIf you ate Cambodian food not knowing its origin, you would recognize the familiar flavors of Thai and Vietnamese dishes. For centuries, Cambodia's borders have been as fluid as Mekong Delta silt. Their kitchens borrowed copiously from one another--and from India and China. Still, each cuisine manages to have its own character, dictated by the supplies at hand. Cambodia's mainstays are the plentiful freshwater fish from the Mekong River and the country's great central lake, as well as the wild leafy herbs that grow along river banks. These--backed up with lemon grass, varieties of mints and basils, tamarind and native limes--create a unique flavor.\nSan Francisco has many Cambodian restaurants. Thanks to the volunteers assisting local Cambodian refugees--and healthy San Franciscan appetites--they are thriving.\nBut a knowledgeable Asian-food expert complains that most of the foods are \"geared to the American palate,\" perhaps as Chinese food was in the old chop suey days. While it is true that most Cambodians do not eat out, and the menus therefore tend to emphasize the dishes that American diners most enjoy, I have found the food to be quite authentic.\nAt San Francisco's Phnom Penh restaurant, there was no water buffalo--a treat in Cambodia. But the pounded fish paste on heart of banana flower was exotic enough. And, I should add, absolutely delicious--something I might serve as an appetizer to foodie friends to get the conversation rolling.\nI can say with a fair amount of certainty that business people lunching at the 3-year-old establishment need not worry about having their suits wrinkled (from sitting on authentic straw mats around bowls of food, as is the custom in Cambodia).\nInstead, the storefront restaurant offers tables thoughtfully appointed Western style, with white linens and fresh flowers in a tranquil room. These discreet amenities and the well-organized staff are not an accident. Owner Joanna Ty's husband, Keav Ty, managed a restaurant in Cambodia that served primarily as a spot for huge banquets and wedding feasts.\nAnyone interested in getting the true feeling of Cambodian dining should consider Phnom Penh's soups. Soup served with rice is frequently the heart of a Cambodian meal and sometimes the only thing served. Phnom Penh offers soups from three of the cuisine's four major soup categories: samlaw , samlaw machhou and sgnor. The most popular"}

Koko herself chose the pet from a litter in 1984, giving it the signed name of All Ball. Photos of the gentle gorilla cuddling the kitten were widely published. The story had a sad end in December of that year, when All Ball got loose and was hit and killed by a car. Koko\u2019s trainer, Dr. Francine Patterson, wrote a chidren\u2019s book about the pair titled Koko\u2019s Kitten.\nKoko was famous enough that she had already been the subject of a 1978 documentary, Koko, a Talking Gorilla, by director Barbet Schroeder.\nThe fictional KING KONG is certainly the tallest of the great apes, standing around 25 feet high in his original 1933 movie.

She'll also be pleading guilty on behalf of International Packing LLC and Universal Cheese and Drying Inc.\nThe two Slippery Rock-based businesses charged were accused of mislabeling products made by family-owned Castle Cheese. Myrter is vice president of Castle and an officer in the other firms.\nStephen Stallings, a former federal prosecutor and Pittsburgh-based defense attorney for Myrter and the companies, declined to comment in advance of the guilty pleas.\nMyrter faces up to a year in prison and a $500,000 fine. The companies could also each be fined up to $500,000 or up to twice their ill-gotten profits from selling the cheese.\nMyrter is charged with aiding and abetting the introduction of misbranded and adulterated food into interstate commerce. The companies are each charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, a catch-all charge that often covers regulatory violations.\nThe charges don't specify where the cheese was sold, or how much of it went to stores, and they don't specify what was in the cheese, only that products labeled \"100 percent real Parmesan and Romano\" cheeses weren't as required by the Food and Drug Administration.\nBut according to an FDA report on Castle Cheese reported by Bloomberg News earlier this month \"no parmesan cheese was used to manufacture\" the company's Market Pantry brand or the Always Save and Best Choice branded parmesan cheese. Instead, they were made with a combination of Swiss, mozzarella and white cheddar cheeses, along with cellulose, which is made with wood pulp. Up to 4 percent cellulose is allowed as a safe additive in such cheeses, according to standards set forth by the FDA.\nThe Market Pantry cheese was sold at Target stores. The other brands were sold through 3,400 stores controlled by Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., based in Kansas City, Kansas.\nMinneapolis-based Target has previously said that Castle Cheese hasn't been an authorized vendor, and the chain was investigating the FDA's findings.

A graduate of Goucher College and Georgetown Law, she became the only woman on the state's second-highest court when then-Gov. William Donald Schaefer appointed her after she served five years as a circuit judge in Baltimore.\nJames K. Bredar, 52, of Reisterstown, a federal magistrate judge, was recommended for a district judgeship in the Baltimore division. The graduate of Harvard College and Georgetown Law would fill a vacancy created by the decision of Judge J. Frederick Motz, a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, to take senior status.\nMotz, 67, whose decision was made public Friday, is the longest-serving judge on the federal district bench in Maryland. Judges who assume senior status don't necessarily retire. They have the option to continue hearing cases, typically in smaller numbers but often for many years. His wife, Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, has sat on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1994.\nCharles B. Day, 52, of Olney, also a federal magistrate judge, was the senators' choice for a federal district judgeship in the Greenbelt division, which covers the southern part of the state. A graduate of the University of Maryland and its law school, he would replace Judge Peter Messitte, like Davis a nominee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, who took senior status in 2008.\nFederal magistrates are trial judges appointed by U.S. district judges. They often relieve the workload on the district court by handling pretrial motions and presiding over non-felony trials.\nObama has the final say on federal judicial nominees, who must be confirmed by the Senate before they can take office. The White House, which received the Maryland names Friday, will review the recommendations with the Department of Justice, a process that can take months.\nSelections by home-state senators carry considerable weight in judicial selections, particularly at the district court level and especially when made by senators of the president's party, as is the case in Maryland this year for the first time since 2000.\nSens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin began the search for new judges last spring. After receiving applications from prospective candidates, they reviewed the names with legal specialists and interviewed the finalists.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the selections are in line with a pattern that has developed in Obama's first year: the nomination of judges for judicial vacancies, as opposed to lawyers without experience on the bench.\nThat adds judicial experience to the federal courts and a record of past decisions that makes it easier to gauge their qualifications, but it also reduces diversity in the judicial system.\n\"The whole notion of a career judiciary,\" said Tobias, \"is a notion that the U.S. has resisted.\"\nThere are 10 federal judge positions in the Maryland district, considered one of the busiest in the nation.

Last Tuesday, however, a new poll from Monmouth University showed Clinton with a nine-point lead over Trump, 48 percent to 39 percent.\nSome analysts say that Trump's biggest challenge will be to galvanize rank and file Republicans, especially white women, and somehow try to break into Clinton's solid support among blacks and Latinos.\nBut there's another problem that Trump has largely ignored until now that could tip the balance against him if he's not careful: The fast spreading and highly dreaded Zika virus in southern Florida.\nConcern within the state about the mosquito-transmitted virus that can damage the fetuses of infected pregnant women has been festering for months and is detected in Miami Beach.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress departed in mid-July with a $1.1 billion spending bill to fight the spread of the virus and help develop a vaccine mired in the Senate. Democrats complained that the Republicans had loaded up the measure with \"poison pills\" including a ban on federal spending for Planned Parenthood.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) blamed the Democrats for blocking final action on the spending bill and holding up action by federal agencies to assist Florida. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the bill was unacceptable in its present form and blamed the Republicans for risking the health of thousands of people and new born infants.\nClinton intervened in the Zika virus crisis in early August, joining many Republican and Democratic officials from Florida in demanding that Congress cut short its summer recess and pass the $1.1 billion spending bill to help combat the spread of the dreaded disease in the continental United States.\nBut Trump has largely ignored the issue, essentially leaving it to Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott to handle. During campaign stops in two Florida cities August 3, Trump dodged reporters' questions on what he would do, according to CNN.\n\"You have a great governor who's doing a fantastic job -- Rick Scott -- on the Zika,\" Trump said. \"And it's a problem. It's a big problem. But I watch and I see. And I see what they're doing with the spraying and everything else. And I think he's doing a fantastic job and he's letting everyone know exactly what the problem is and how to get rid of it. He's going to have it under control, he probably already does.\"\nThere is little doubt the Zika crisis could blow up in Republicans faces if they're not careful. Just as the Republicans won back control of the Senate in 2014 in part by criticizing the Obama administration's lackluster response to Ebola, the GOP could get hit this fall for standing in the way of Zika funding.\nGov. Scott had urged public calm, even as he and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) pleaded with the federal government to provide more resources and called on Ryan and McConnell to summon lawmakers into a special session to break the impasse over the Zika funding bill.\nThe disease, which is spread by mosquitoes and poses high risks to pregnant women and the elderly, already has affected"}

Rick Snyder and legislative leaders from both parties \u2014 is that a House Fiscal Agency analysis shows it hikes taxes by about $1.9 billion in order to direct about $1.3 billion toward Michigan's crumbling roads and bridges.\nDepending on one's outlook, the fact that the plan also benefits K-12 schools ($200 million-$290 million); transit and rail ($116 million); local governments ($111 million), and low and moderate-income families ($260 million through restoration of the Earned Income Tax Credit), is either a selling point or a near-fatal drawback.

No road plan could be approved last year without support from Democrats, who used a rare opportunity for leverage to secure improved funding for K-12 schools and restoration of a tax credit they say will help mitigate the effects of higher sales and fuel taxes for working families.\n\"We all know that to get Democrats on board, they had to sweeten the deal,\" said Greg Hoover of Fowlerville, who owns a small painting business and says he will be voting yes.\nThe roads \"need money, and they need it now, and this is all we have,\" Hoover said. \"If we don't pass it, then we go back to the drawing board.\"\nProponents say one of the plan's most attractive features is that it takes the sales tax off of fuel sales, undoing a situation the Free Press has reported on in which Michigan charges some of the highest taxes on fuel in the nation"}

Do you have any idea how many you haven't tried?\nThere are around 10,000 wineries in the U.S, the fourth-largest wine producing country in the world. And consider this, one of the largest wineries in America\u2014E & J Gallo\u2014has somewhere north of 70 imprints in their portfolio alone, including some of the most recognizable labels out there, and yet I'm willing to bet that many readers haven't sampled even a fraction of those.\nThis isn't revelatory data, or a case study on large wineries, but a casual conversation about consumer choice. I once heard someone say that there are a million wine brands in the world. Is that hyperbole? The astronomical one million? Or is it fact? Do we know? We could parse the reports and maybe round up some figures, but the bottom line is you can't drink 'em all. How to choose?\nWhile Ruiz Hudson does work at a wine store, this is actually unbiased advice. I agree wholeheartedly and I know most wine enthusiasts will too. Wine shops tailor their inventory to their customers rather than a corporate footprint\u2014owners will often make special orders, conduct classes or tastings and spend dedicated time curating their offering because they care what you think.\n\"It\u2019s always good to offer feedback as well, even if you didn\u2019t care for something. If you buy a couple of bottles on one visit and end up liking one more than the other, let the salesperson know on your next visit,\" recommends Ruiz Hudson. \"It will help them calibrate their suggestions to your palate and better steer you in the direction of wines you\u2019ll love. The more you go on in, the better they\u2019ll get to know you.\"\n\"If you notice you always seem to be drawn to the same grapes, get to know them better and find out where else they grow. Grapes will express themselves differently from place to place, but there will be a common throughline in their flavor profile,\" says Ruiz Hudson.\nThis is an evolution of preference for a certain variety. Rather than relying on old faithful, this idea uses favorites as breadcrumbs, hints at treasures down the road.\n\"For example, if you like Malbec from Argentina, try one from its original home in Cahors in France. Like Pinot Noir? Try a Burgundy or Sancerre Rouge from France, a Sp\u00e4tburgunder from Germany or Austria, or a grab a bottle from Central Otago in New Zealand. You can take a trip around the world with many grapes.\"\n\"Take A Deep Dive Into A Region\"\n\"If you find you tend to like wines from a particular place, explore what else they grow there. Even with completely different grapes, you might find some commonalities in style and terroir,\" says Ruiz Hudson.\n\"Let\u2019s say you fall in love with Barolo or Barbaresco from the Piedmont in Italy. These are beautiful but pricey wines. However, if you look closer you might discover some delicious Barberas and Dolcettos that are available at much more affordable prices. You might even come across some of their lovely white wines, such as Arneis, to refresh your palate.\"\nThis is an angle often overlooked. We do hear certain regions compare themselves, latitudinally, to other regions, but rarely are buying decisions made in this way.\n\"You can find some big"}

The downside of limited liability partnership is likely to be that the regulations concerning the preparation of financial accounts will be similar to those that apply to limited companies - including having to submit copies to Companies House, which are available for inspection by any interested party.\nHowever, many business people prefer the flexibility that partnerships allow, but have been fearful of their exposure to personal debt. A limited liability partnership provides something approaching the best of both worlds (see 'Damage Limitation', AJ 22.3.01).\nWhen a partnership gets to a certain size there is likely to be a decision either to become a limited company or to go the limited liability partnership route. The advantage of remaining a partnership is the freedom. For example, there is greater freedom to borrow. The limited company route, however, has some recent useful tax breaks.\nFrom a taxation perspective, it is invariably better to be a limited company. Successive budgets have resulted in the Chancellor bringing more and more concessions. In 2002 a zero rate of corporation tax was introduced for the first \u00a310,000 of business profits.\n30 per cent on profits above \u00a31,500,000 (the Full Rate).\nSmall limited architectural companies can engineer their affairs to avoid the consequences of this month's increases in National Insurance and can save themselves thousands of pounds.\nMany small businesses have few employees, apart from the directors/ shareholders themselves. This means that they can reduce their salaries down to the level at which a National Insurance credit is received but no National Insurance is actually paid (\u00a3385 per month).\nThe difference can be extracted from the business by voting themselves dividends. And, of course, the dividends on the first \u00a310,000 of profits are tax-free, provided there is no overall liability at the 40 per cent higher rate.\nTo reward the individual working shareholders in exactly the same rates and ratios that they would have been rewarded in the form of salary, it is possible to designate that each working shareholder has a different class of shares - perhaps called 'A' and 'B' shares (see AJ 10.4.03).\nThis permits them to each extract different amounts from one another, without one of them having to regularly waive their entitlement to part of the dividends. Such an arrangement is likely to be particularly attractive to small architectural companies where the husband and wife are the only shareholders, and one of them has other income from outside the business, as both basic rate bands can be fully utilised.\nAs businesses with relatively little VAT on purchases in comparison with VAT charged on turnover, all architects with a turnover of less than \u00a3600,000 should benefit from joining the cash accounting scheme. Under these accounting arrangements, VAT on sales need not be accounted for until payment has been received from the customer.\nIn addition to providing a cash flow advantage, the scheme also allows for automatic bad debt relief, as no VAT ever becomes due if the customer does not pay. Those already on the cash accounting scheme should note that their eligibility to use it does not cease when their turnover exceeds the \u00a3600,000 threshold. There is a built-in 25 per cent tolerance within the scheme, meaning that turnover must exceed \u00a3"}

Jackson if he could hold the Oscar for her. It was so heavy. She was so nervous. He said no, later explaining, \"Do you know how absurd that would look?\" The tall, imposing African American actor would be cooling his heels, keeping the award warm for the waifish, white documentarian.\nWhether Jackson was right or not about how this might be perceived, one thing is certain: Seretean is colorblind. \"Big Mama,\" (premiering tonight on Cinemax) whose characters are African American, could easily be about race but isn't. It's about family and love. Big Mama is Viola Dees, who, at 89, was attempting to raise her 9-year-old grandson, Walter, in South-Central L.A. Aside from the obvious difference in ages, Viola had to cope with Walter's erratic behavior, the product of his in-utero exposure to crack, his mother's abandonment of him and his father's death. As if this weren't enough, Viola's health was failing and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services was trying to take Walter away from her, reasoning, not so unreasonably, that she was too old to care for him.\nOriginally, Seretean read about Viola in a Los Angeles Times article detailing her fight to keep Walter.\n\"I thought, 'Wow, what a woman, she should have legal guardianship of him,' \" Seretean says. \"I just went to a pay phone and got directory assistance. I got her on the line and took down her address and said, 'Keep up the good fight,' and wrote her a little note and sent her a check.\"\nThe check was for $500. That was in January 1996. The following December, Seretean received a singing Christmas card from Viola along with a letter telling her how she and Walter were doing. Seretean went to visit her and was so charmed by her and so impressed by others' response to the article--Viola had a stack of letters from people who'd read it--that she thought: This woman is a film. Never mind that she'd never made one and didn't know the first thing about filmmaking. At the time, Seretean was producing KCRW's \"Morning Becomes Eclectic\" and \"The Treatment.\" Previously she had worked in corporate marketing. She was, as she laughingly concedes, succeeding downward.\nSeretean took a monthlong course in filmmaking and shot what she regards as a \"horrible\" eight-minute short about Viola. Bad as it was, she pursued the story--that is, raised money and found people who knew what they were doing to help her. She subsequently won a grant from Aperture, which gave her a year to turn in a 30-minute film about Viola and Walter.\nOn the day she was to begin filming, Seretean almost lost her subject. She and her director of photography met Viola at her doctor's office to pick her up, only to learn that she had suffered a heart attack and that she should be taken to a hospital immediately. While suffering chest pains, Viola apologized for not feeling well and gave Seretean permission to begin shooting. So Seretean was there to capture an amazing"}

At the IAEA\u2019s 35-member Board of Governors (BOG) meeting on December 3, the resolution for the Nuclear Fuel Bank (NFB) was passed with 28 votes in favour, six abstentions and one member choosing not to vote. India voted in favour of the resolution. Whereas the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the investor tycoon Warren Buffet have collectively contributed $50 million, several countries have also made funds available to the IAEA for the purpose. Major contributors are: the United States ($ 50 million); European Union ($ 25 million); the United Arab Emirates ($10 million); Kuwait ($ 10 million) and Norway ($ 5 million).\nIt has taken more than 55 years for the world to agree to such an agreement. The idea of institutionalising the Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) was first mooted in the 1946 Acheson-Lilienthal Report, officially called Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy. Acknowledging the inherent dangers in the proliferation of fuel cycle know-how, the report categorically stated that \u201cthe industry required and the technology developed for the realization of atomic weapons are the same technology which play so essential a part in man\u2019s almost universal striving to improve his universal standard of living and his control of nature.\u201d1 Recognising this dual aspect of nuclear technology, the report recommended international control over all \u2018intrinsically dangerous phases\u2019 of NFC, the development of which was to be assigned to an international organisation \u2018 responsible to all people\u2019.\nThe Nuclear Fuel Bank to be established is far less extensive in scope compared to what the Acheson-Lilienthal report had in mind. It does not propose to aggregate all sensitive phases of NFC under the IAEA. What it purports to do however is to \u201cdissuade countries from pursuing their own uranium enrichment programmes by providing them with an assured supply of fuel at market price.\u201d2 The proposed NFB would provide fuel to only those states that shall be in good standing with the international nuclear watchdog \u2013 the IAEA. This basically means that all states seeking assistance from the IAEA should be in compliance with their international commitments especially obligations under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). This also suggests that non-NPT member states such as India and Pakistan would not be able to access fuel from the NFB. Moreover, the bank does not propose to replace existing market mechanisms but only intends to fill the gap whenever states seeking peaceful uses of nuclear energy face supply bottlenecks due to political reasons.\nSince nuclear reactors are expensive and nuclear energy needs a lot of initial investment, states are always concerned about nuclear fuel supplies. Many times in the past, supplier states have put forth conditions on the supply of nuclear fuel. The abrupt changes in US nuclear fuel supply policies in the 1970s are one of the most glaring examples in this regard. Since such uncertainties create a strong incentive for states to develop indigenous nuclear fuel cycles, the NFB under the IAEA may help mitigate some of these concerns. Countries such as Iran and North Korea have often rationalised their indigenous NFCs on the pretext of their hostile relationship with other states such as the USA who wield considerable influence on the global nuclear fuel supply chain"}

Daniel Levin, then the acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, was waterboarded so he could better understand the issues before his office. Since then the artist Coco Fusco made an hourlong video called \u201cOperation Atropos\u201d about undergoing other interrogation techniques. And in the August issue of Vanity Fair, Christopher Hitchens described the horror of being waterboarded \u2014 just months after he described the horror of having his private parts waxed.\nOf course none of those people did it across the street from where the World\u2019s Tiniest Lady once sat.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something so shocking about this,\u201d said Anne Pasternak, president and artistic director of Creative Time."}

About 50,000 people live in the area to be served by the conduit, but many are on low or fixed incomes.\nThe new legislation provides for a 65 percent federal cost share and a plan to repay the entire cost of the project using revenues from Bureau of Reclamation excess-capacity contracts.\n\"On behalf of the beneficiaries of the conduit, we're happy that it was signed so quickly,\" said Bill Long, president of the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District and a resident of Las Animas, one of the 42 communities that could be served by the conduit. \"Hopefully the rest of the project will move as fast.\"\nLong, who also is a Bent County commissioner, has worked on the Southeastern committee trying to secure funding for the conduit for nearly a decade. He thinks the political climate to obtain funding is good since the federal government is looking for shovel-ready infrastructure projects as part of the economic stimulus plan.\n\"This is a good infrastructure project, one that's been well vetted,\" Long said. \"We are ready to start the next phase.\"\nU.S. Rep. John Salazar, D-Colo., was on hand when Obama signed the bill.\n\"This is truly one of the proudest days of my legislative career and I am honored to have had the opportunity to join President Obama at the White House for today's historic bill signing,\" Salazar said. \"These bills represent years of hard work and substantial input from communities large and small throughout my district.

It underscores the importance of grain security and cybersecurity, as well as preventing and effectively resolving incidents that affect social stability, such as food-safety scandals. In addition, the law stresses the need to prevent cyberattacks and dissemination of illegal and \"harmful\" content online.\nIt says the authorities should put mechanisms in place to guard against regional and international financial risks, to protect the security of Chinese citizens and organizations overseas, and to safeguard interests abroad.\nIn addition to stressing the need for ethnic harmony, the law addresses the threats of terrorism, religious cults, and overseas interference in religious issues.\nHong Kong University law professor Fu Hualing said he wondered why the party's National Security Commission was not mentioned in the draft, saying it was not clear what legal status it had and how its power would be regulated by law.\nDr. Eva Pils, a China law expert at King's College, University of London, said that by not making a direct reference to the commission, the law was leaving open which party entity would be in charge of national security. And as the law did not regulate party organs nor seek to curb the party's power, it affirmed the party's supremacy over the state on national security.\nPils said she was also worried that the definition of national security meant that \"practically any aspect of social or economic life can be regarded as a matter of national security and thus gives the institutions empowered by the law a mandate to intervene.\"\n\"I think the law also manifests a neo-totalitarian ambition to reach into every sector or society,\" she said.\nThe first clause of the law stated that its mission was to \"safeguard national security, defend the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics\" as well as the \"realization of the great rejuvenation of the nation.\"\nJoshua Rosenzweig, a law researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he was alarmed at the \"strong ideology flavor"}

We\u2019re 15 days after the Super Bowl, so there\u2019s been enough time to put the game, great as it was, in the rear-view mirror. We\u2019re 10 days out from the start of the combine. So let\u2019s take a morning to set the table for the event of this off-season: the re-setting of the quarterback market in the NFL.\nThe future of Tony Romo is the most compelling story of all. He\u2019ll be 37 in April. He\u2019s missed 27 of his last 32 games due to injury, and by the time he\u2019d suit up for anyone next September (if he does, and we\u2019ll get to that), Romo will have played one series of football in 21 months. Of course the question is: How do you count on Romo at all? But some team will, and rightfully so, because it\u2019s a good gamble. It\u2019s not a good gamble for a lot of guaranteed money, but Romo shouldn\u2019t care about money at this stage. He should care about the opportunity he\u2019s always wanted \u2014 to take a team deep into the playoffs, which he may well have done last year but for the Cliff Avril hit/awkward fall in the preseason game at Seattle that kayoed Romo with another back injury for all but one offensive series of 2016.\nLet\u2019s line up the pool of players, and the needy teams, and try to forecast who\u2019s going where \u2014 or at least give you a best guess.\nI am stunned Washington GM Scot McCloughan could pay Cousins the whopper franchise number of $24 million a year, particularly when there\u2019s a sense the franchise likes him a lot but isn\u2019t sold on him. But what\u2019s the alternative? If Washington doesn\u2019t franchise him, San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan steals him. The Niners still could steal Cousins after being franchised \u2014 and after the draft \u2014 by signing him and hoping Washington doesn\u2019t match but rather takes the 49ers\u2019 first-round picks in 2018 and 2019. (If not franchised and signed before the draft, Cousins would fetch a team\u2019s 2017 and 2018 first-rounders, trouble because San Francisco owns the second overall pick in April.) Washington blanches at the thought of paying Cousins $44 million over 2016 and 2017, but it\u2019s more likely than not to happen. The alternative, losing Cousins and not having a remotely sure thing in the wings, is worse.\nThe Garoppolo story will be fun to see play out, and I\u2019m in the minority here, but I don\u2019t see the Patriots trading him. He\u2019s the first legit heir to Tom Brady that the franchise has had. Brady\u2019s going to be 40 in August. Bill Belichick has never been a slave to high picks. I just think he\u2019d rather have the insurance of Garoppolo with Brady in the saddle at 40. Cleveland and Chicago like Garoppolo, and I\u2019d be surprised if Shanahan doesn\u2019t \u2026 More about Romo later, but Houston and Kansas City look like the best landing spots for him, with a contract befitting an old quarterback with a long injury history \u2026 McCarron wants to play somewhere, and he knows that Andy Dalton (three starts missed in six seasons) isn\u2019t giving up the chair.

{"idx": "36214", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Vinyl composite tiles, or VCT, are the newer version of vinyl flooring products. Like the older products, the longer the VCT has been down on the floor, the more difficult it is to remove the adhesive. Therefore, VCT that is only a few months or years old may come up easily, while VCT that has been down longer may take more effort. In either case, removing VCT is a multiple-step process.\nVCT is typically sold in 12-inch or larger tiles. Unless the floor is fairly fresh and recently installed, cutting the tiles into quarters or smaller sections can help make their removal easier. VCT can be cut with a utility knife that has a very sharp blade. Pull the knife along the tile, pressing down firmly so it bites all the way through to the adhesive. Cutting the tiles like this helps identify stuck or stubborn spots on the floor. In some cases, a large tile that is not coming up may only have a small section or corner holding it. By cutting the tiles, you can identify the stuck sections and work on them more closely, making the job go faster.\nVCT is made of layers. The top layer is what you see. There is also an underlayer, or backing, that is adhered to the floor. Frequently, when you are removing VCT, the top layer comes up first, pulling itself away from the backing. This exposes the adhesive layer and makes the removal process easier. Use a putty knife to get beneath the cut sections of the tiles and scrape or pry them up. In some cases, the entire section of tile and adhesive will come up together. In other cases, only the top section will peel away. Remove as much of the tile as possible during this step, even if it's only the top layer that comes away.\nThe bottom layer and most of the adhesive can be removed with either a floor or wall scraper. If the section you are removing is small, a wall scraper may be adequate. On large sections of flooring, use a floor scraper with a long handle to save your knees and back. Hold the scraper at a 45-degree angle to the floor and push it in short strokes beneath the backing and adhesive. Work in small sections at a time. If you encounter a particularly stubborn patch of adhesive that does not come up easily with the scraper, leave it and move on to the next section.\nAny adhesive that did not come up with the floor scraper can be removed by applying heat to soften it. This can be done by either aiming a heat gun at a section for a few minutes or holding a clothes iron a few inches away from the adhesive. Never touch either the heat gun nor the iron directly to the adhesive; it may soften and adhere to the appliance. Once the adhesive has softened, use the floor scraper to remove it. Push the scraper beneath the adhesive and use short strokes until it comes off of the floor.\nAsaff, Sarabeth. \"How to Take Up VCT Flooring.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/up-vct-flooring-36177.html.

{"idx": "36218", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Israel can either choose to undo the apartheid reality or face what apartheid breeds \u2014 resistance.\nA country founded on the idea of segregation between peoples and communities will always have to deal with demographics. A country founded as the result of conquest and colonization of indigenous people and their land will, by necessity, be preoccupied with demographic questions. Even a country that has not successfully actualized the idea of segregation will be forced to deal with demographics, too. The state of Israel, in all three of the above ways, is such a country.\nPerhaps the recent Israeli preoccupation with the demographics of the land between the river and the sea stems from political reasons \u2014 an attempt by opponents of the right-wing governing coalition to disrupt the Right\u2019s attempts to de jure annex the occupied territories, though they have long been annexed de facto. But perhaps the preoccupation this time is genuine. Israel is facing a changing strategic variable: the demographic parity between Jews and Arabs between the river and the sea.\nThis demographic parity takes on a new meaning in a political reality where the Green Line has been erased and talk of annexing the West Bank is on the rise. Israel proper \u2014 excluding the occupied territories \u2014 could deal with an Arab minority of 20 percent of the population. The combination of this minority with the Palestinians in the West Bank, however, creates a new reality: Palestinians comprise 40 percent of the population on both sides of the Green Line. And if one includes the residents of the Gaza Strip, there is clear demographic parity.\nSome look at these numbers and round up \u2014 it\u2019s 50:50, they say. Others try to minimize the \u201cdemographic threat\u201d posed by the Palestinians by citing other figures. And there are those who will argue with you over birth rates and death rates, the number of children, the number of youth, and more within each population to strengthen their own claims and weaken those of their opponents.\nRegardless, the question for Israel remains: after defeating the Palestinians on the political, economic, military, and cultural fronts, what will Israel do in response to the new demographic figures? Or, to put the question more simply: what will Israel do to address its shrinking strategic advantage in the face of demographic parity?\nThe founding of Israel, which is celebrating its 70th year of independence, involved the removal of the majority of the Palestinian people from their homeland and the destruction of Palestinian society. Numerous injustices befell the Palestinian people before Israel\u2019s founding and after. The Palestinian tragedy is ongoing, as Israel continues to deal with the demographic question through population transfers, the uprooting of Palestinians from their homes, and \u201cJudaization\u201d of the land.\nIsrael, if we judge according to what is actually happening, is an apartheid state par exellance. \u201cEconomic peace\u201d\u2014how Israeli officials describe the current arrangement in the West Bank\u2014is simply a euphemism for apartheid. \u201cThere is no Palestinian partner for peace\u201d is an empty excuse for those who want to maintain the apartheid reality.\nWhat does apartheid look like in the Israeli context?

It also fits in with recent discoveries of remains and genetic studies that also indicate an earlier departure from Africa.\nThe researchers analysed a fragment of a jawbone with eight teeth, found in Misliya cave in 2002. The jawbone looked as if it was from a modern human rather than from one of the other species of human that existed at the time.\nIt is only now that an international research team has conclusively shown that the archaeologists' initial gut feelings were spot on.\nThe researchers confirmed that the jawbone belonged to a modern human by carrying out computed tomography (CT) scans of it, building up a 3D virtual model and comparing it with archaic human fossils from Africa, Europe and Asia - as well as modern human remains. Separate scans also enabled the researchers to probe the tissue beneath the tooth crowns, which was found to be uniquely associated with modern humans.\nThree separate dating methods, conducted in three separate laboratories unaware of the others' results concluded that the fossilised remains were between 177,000 and 194,000 years old.\nBefore that, the oldest evidence of humans outside Africa came from the Skhul and Qafzeh archaeological sites in Israel, and were dated to between 90,000 and 125,000 years ago.\nThe Misliya remains were found in a layer containing stone tools that belong to the Levallois type, which was used in the region between 250,000 and 140,000 years ago. If Levallois tools are associated with the spread of modern humans into the area, it suggests that our species may have journeyed beyond Africa even earlier than the dates for the Misliya material.\nUntil recently, early evidence for excursions outside Africa by Homo sapiens was limited to the Levant. But in the last few years, discoveries of modern human fossils from Daoxian and Zhirendong in China dated to between 80,000 and 120,000 years ago suggest early waves of migration pushed further into Eurasia than previously supposed.\nIn addition, genetic studies have turned up signs of early interbreeding between African humans and our evolutionary relatives the Neanderthals.\nLast year, researchers published evidence from German Neanderthal remains of mixing that occurred between 219,000 and 4"}

Brown blessed the site with holy water. The selection of an architect represents \u201cthe first of many steps\u201d toward building the first Roman Catholic Cathedral in Orange County, Brown said in a prepared statement.\nThe architect, Craig W. Hartman, works for the San Francisco office of an international architecture firm called Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. His past projects have included the international terminal at San Francisco International Airport, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and Christ the Light Cathedral in Oakland.\nAn anonymous donor is covering the cost of the cathedral\u2019s design phase, diocese spokesman Ryan Lilyengren said. He did not know how much that phase will cost, but said it will likely take several months.\nHe also said it\u2019s too early to say how much the cathedral itself will cost. Documents filed several years ago with the city describe a central church with 2,650 seats and side buildings for daycare, a preschool and meeting rooms, Lilyengren said.\nIt will be built to be energy efficient and to reflect the diversity of the diocese itself, Lilyengren said.\nThe \u201cChrist Our Savior\u201d Cathedral complex would take up 15 acres near the corner of Bear Street and West MacArthur Boulevard, near Santa Ana\u2019s border with Costa Mesa. The site, a former lima bean field, used to be called Gospel Swamp because of the evangelical activity in the area.\nWhen Brown blessed the site in 2002, the diocese was hoping to raise $75 million to pay for the cathedral and other projects. But fundraising was already on hold, in part because of what Brown described then as the \u201cserious challenge\u201d of the national priest sexual-abuse scandal.\nThe Diocese of Orange agreed in 2005 to a record $100 million settlement with 90 alleged victims of sexual abuse.\nThe diocese has used Holy Family parish and church in Orange as a stand-in cathedral ever since it broke from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in 1976.

And the Cavs still didn\u2019t win. Love missed the Finals last summer because of a dislocated shoulder. Irving fractured a kneecap in Game 1 against the Warriors and never returned. In the Cavaliers\u2019 alternate Finals universe, they would have defeated Golden State with both men healthy.\nIrving\u2019s minutes are still limited because of his recuperation from the knee issue. He played a little more than 26 minutes against the Warriors and scored 13 points, averaging more points-per-minute than Curry but not making enough of a difference. Love scored 10 but was a force on the backboard with 18 rebounds, 15 of them at the defensive end.\nNo one wearing a Warriors \u201cwhite-out\u201d tee shirt was complaining. The home crowd at Oracle has not seen a loss since January 27. From an entertainment standpoint, Friday\u2019s game was indeed not pretty, though enjoyable in a grimy sort of way.

Finally, the arrows wink approval, a few cars move into the intersection and stop, blocking it: Two other signals downstream are favoring cars entering or leaving shopping centers that sit face to face.\nCounty traffic engineer Steve Decker has come up with a plan that could resolve this problem: eliminating the median cuts and traffic signals on State Road 436 between U.S. Highway 17-92 and Oxford Road. Although he admits his plan, though operationally sound, is not \"politically attractive,\" Mr. Decker says he will push for the changes.\nBully for Mr. Decker's courage, and here is hope that he succeeds.\nUp at DeLand, a state traffic engineer is not sure how such a request would be met: The Department of Transportation is used to approving requests for adding median cuts and lights; removal is something new.\nThe key will be elected officials in Seminole County and Casselberry.

{"idx": "36247", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Originally published in The Libertarian Forum, Vol. 10, No. 7, July 1977.\nI have been ruminating recently on what are the crucial questions that divide libertarians. Some that have received a lot of attention in the last few years are: anarcho-capitalism vs. limited government, abolitionism vs. gradualism, natural rights vs. utilitarianism, and war vs. peace. But I have concluded that as important as these questions are, they don't really cut to the nub of the issue, of the crucial dividing line between us.\nLet us take, for example, two of the leading anarcho-capitalist works of the last few years: my own For a New Liberty and David Friedman's Machinery of Freedom. Superficially, the major differences between them are my own stand for natural rights and for a rational libertarian law code, in contrast to Friedman's amoralist utilitarianism and call for logrolling and trade-offs between non-libertarian private police agencies. But the difference really cuts far deeper. There runs through For a New Liberty (and most of the rest of my work as well) a deep and pervasive hatred of the State and all of its works, based on the conviction that the State is the enemy of mankind. In contrast, it is evident that David does not hate the State at all; that he has merely arrived at the conviction that anarchism and competing private police forces are a better social and economic system than any other alternative. Or, more fully, that anarchism would be better than laissez-faire which in turn is better than the current system. Amidst the entire spectrum of political alternatives, David Friedman has decided that anarcho-capitalism is superior. But superior to an existing political structure which is pretty good too. In short, there is no sign that David Friedman in any sense hates the existing American State or the State per se, hates it deep in his belly as a predatory gang of robbers, enslavers, and murderers. No, there is simply the cool conviction that anarchism would be the best of all possible worlds, but that our current set-up is pretty far up with it in desirability. For there is no sense in Friedman that the State \u0096 any State \u0096 is a predatory gang of criminals.\nThe same impression shines through the writing, say, of political philosopher Eric Mack. Mack is an anarcho-capitalist who believes in individual rights; but there is no sense in his writings of any passionate hatred of the State, or, a fortiori, of any sense that the State is a plundering and bestial enemy.\nPerhaps the word that best defines our distinction is \"radical.\" Radical in the sense of being in total, root-and-branch opposition to the existing political system and to the State itself. Radical in the sense of having integrated intellectual opposition to the State with a gut hatred of its pervasive and organized system of crime and injustice. Radical in the sense of a deep commitment to the spirit of liberty and anti-statism that integrates reason and emotion, heart and soul.\nFurthermore, in contrast to what seems to be true nowadays, you don't have to be an anarchist to be radical in our sense, just as you can be an anarchist while missing the radical spark. I can think of hardly a single limited governmentalist of the present day who is radical \u0096 a truly amazing phenomenon, when we think of our classical liberal forbears who were genuinely radical, who hated statism and the"}

More than 2 million of these types are diagnosed every year. Fortunately, both are highly curable.\nHowever, the third type -- melanoma -- is less common but more serious. If not detected early, melanoma can be deadly. In its advanced stages, melanoma can spread to the lymph nodes and internal organs. Some 54,000 people are diagnosed with melanomas of the skin every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And its incidence has been increasing for the last 30 years, especially among young, white women ages 15-30 and white adults 65 and older.\nAs we hit the mid-point of summer, remember that too much fun in the sun can be dangerous. The primary cause of all skin cancers is excessive exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun, which makes the poll results cited above so disturbing. This is the most important preventable cause of all skin cancers.\nHere's more unsettling news from the poll: The age group with the lowest rate of sunscreen use was the 18-29 age group, at a mere 4 percent. In fact, melanoma is the most common form of cancer among young adults 25-29. If we expand the age group to 15-29, we find that melanoma is the second most common form of cancer among that population.\nThe best way to detect the onset of skin cancer is to recognize changes in your skin, especially for the early stages of melanoma. That means examining your skin, especially the upper back, torso, lower legs, head and neck -- places where melanomas tend to occur. If you notice a mole that has changed or is different from others, you should see a dermatologist to be examined within a week or two.\nThe good news is that if detected early, melanoma is highly curable. But early detection is essential: A direct correlation exists between the thickness of the melanoma and survival rate. Only 5 percent of patients whose melanoma has spread to internal organs will survive for six months.\nPatients with known risk factors -- those with more than 50 or unusual moles, those with blood relatives who have had melanoma, Caucasians with light skin -- should be examined annually. Although people with dark skin are less likely to get melanoma, they should be cautious as well. While blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Native Americans develop fewer skin cancers than do whites, the cancer tends to be more aggressive and is more often diagnosed in its later stages.\n- Use a water-resistant sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor of at least 30.\n- Wear protective clothing, like long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses.\n- Seek shade whenever"}

The reason is that they do not follow the 5 simple steps that can actually help them make money in intraday trading. Here is how to do it.\nIntraday trading is all about closing your trading positions the same day. You can buy in the morning and sell the shares before end of the day. Alternatively, you can also sell in the morning and buy back the shares before end of day. In fact, intraday trading is one platforms where you can actually sell shares without having delivery in your demat account.\nIntraday trades are squared off the same day, so they do not, in any way impact your demat account. You can define the order as a Margin for Intraday Square-off (MIS) order and you can get intraday trading limits up to 5-10 times the transaction value, based on the volatility of the stock. That sounds great, but then why 70% of the intraday traders end up losing money? The reason is that they do not follow the 5 simple steps that can actually help them make money in intraday trading.\nHere is how to do it.\nThat is a basic rule you must follow in intraday trading. Set limits to the losses that you are willing to take. Ask yourself: How much are you willing to lose in a trade? Ideally, it should not be more than 2-3% of your capital. How much are you willing to lose in a single day; it should never be more than 4-5% of your overall capital or 20% of profits till date. How much of your overall capital are you willing to lose; not more than 20%. At that point, just get back to the drawing board and rethink your intraday trading strategy all over again. When it comes to intraday trading, take care of the risk and the returns will be taken care of.\nTake the case of 2 traders, Trader A and Trader B who traded Bajaj Finance ahead of its results. Trader A had a view that since the stock had rallied over 15% in the last one month, it must be ripe for a correction. So he tried to short sell the stock and gave up after his stop loss got triggered twice. Trader B bought with 20% of his allocation and decided to wait for a dip to buy more. What is the difference in their approach? While A is trying to outsmart the market, B is playing conservatively on the side of momentum. When you trade intraday, don\u2019t think like a contrarian long-term investor. Gauge whether the momentum of the stock is up or down and just trade accordingly. Going with the flow of momentum is critical in intraday trading.\nOf course, there are numerous intraday trading decisions you can take with technical charts and we will not go into all of them. As an intraday trader, you need to develop the ability to read some basic technical charts on your own. Use supports levels to put buy orders and resistance level to put sell orders. Watch out for decisive break-outs above the resistance and below the support with volumes. These basics of technical analysis can go a long way in improving your intraday trading performance.

The big news was \"Vonage World\" with unlimited calling across the world to over 60 countries, which covers 2/3 of the world's population (4.5 billion) - all for $24.99/month.\nSources have revealed that Vonage has submittd their app to Apple. Having a Vonage iPhone app combined with Vonage's World's global unlimited $24.99 plan could be a killer app that gives Vonage a shot in the arm. Imagine a SIP client on the iPhone that lets you call 60 countries - 2/3 of the world - as much as you want for just $24.99/month. Combine the large user base of iPhone users and the millions of Vonage users and what you could have is the most largely deployed WiFi VoIP phone on the planet! Forget about buying those standalone WiFi SIP or Skype phones which is another device you have to carry.\nBut it gets better... Vonage's current SIP client called Vonage Companion has unique technology which enables it to \"share\" the same SIP credentials with your ATA device connected to your home cordless phone system. Thus, you can accept an incoming call on your PC using Vonage Companion or answer the call using your regular analog phone connected to your SIP-compliant ATA. I discussed this single identity to multiple SIP devices with Vonage last year.\nIn a mid-2008 interview I had with Mary Grikas, Vonage's Executive Director of Device Development I asked, \"What sort of technical challenges did you have having the same CallerID and the same phone number? Obviously, you are leveraging SIP and the ATA that sits at the home residence logs on with one set of SIP credentials and Vonage Companion logs on with different SIP credentials, but it's mapped on your back-end to the same phone number.\"\nMary responded, \"That's really a great question because we actually had to put almost a whole new infrastructure in place with a lot of new equipment. And we actually have proxies that are just dedicated to Companion to handle those calls. We do differentiate between the home TA DID credential and we do have flag for Companion. That way we know, as you said on the back-end it's all mapped and then we know where the call originates. We know if a call originates from Companion versus originating from the TA.\" Mary continued, \"That was a lot of work for our call processing team. They had to do a lot of work configuring that system and all the redundancy and mapping. It was a pretty big effort, but it's something we were committed to doing because we had such an overwhelming request from our customers to implement a feature like that.\nSo what does this mean for the iPhone & the Vonage app?\nWell, since their single SIP identity technology is done on the back-end, you will have a Vonage iPhone app that does the same thing as Vonage Companion. Thus, you will be able to receive calls to your home phone directly on your iPhone using VoIP or of course you can answer the call on your home phone.. No more remembering to setup your home phone to call forward to your cell phone when traveling! Further, your outbound calls can use your home phone number's CallerID and use your unlimited bucket of VoIP minutes.\nThe real question will be if Apple allows the Vonage iPhone app to work over 3G.

Upon entering, one must be ready for class (thus, for example, the belt must be put on and all jewelry removed, including watches, necklaces, rings, and earrings, prior to entering the dojo). Removal of jewelry is for safety purposes.\nAny time we enter or leave the dojo, we bow toward shomen, as a sign of respect for everything that the dojo means to us. Shomen is the front wall of the room; sho means \u201ctrue\u201d and men means \u201cface\u201d. In traditional dojos, the kamiza (miniature Shinto shrine), hata (club\u2019s flag), and dojo kun are placed at shomen, thus making it into a somewhat sacred area. Bowing is a Japanese custom for displaying respect, humility, and lack of arrogance. It is not a matter of \u201cbowing down\u201d to a superior; as you notice, black belts bow to lower belts and vice versa.\nConsidering that we train barefoot, the floor of the dojo must be cleaned prior to class. This is a task fulfilled by all members of the dojo before class. Usually, we line up in rank order and sweep. If you come in late and you see that higher-ranking dojo members are sweeping, you should take the broom from a higher-ranking club member and sweep.\nSeiza (\u201ckneel down\u201d): done in rank order, starting with the higher ranks first.\nMokuso (\u201cmeditate\u201d): we take one minute to empty our minds and prepare for maximum concentration during class. Meditation should be done with eyes closed, body relaxed, and exclusive concentration on your breathing.\nMokuso yame (\u201cstop meditating\u201d): gently return the focus from your inner self back to the environment you are in.\nShomen ni rei (\u201cbow to shomen\u201d): we bow as a sign of respect and thanks to the founder of Shotokan and the ancestors. This tradition has its roots in Shinto religion. We all bow down at the same time, but we come up in a wave. Come up only when you see the higher ranking member next to you come up. Never come up before the instructor, as it is considered rude.\nSensei ni rei (\u201cbow to sensei\u201d): the entire class bows to the teacher. If sensei is not present, the command will be senpai ni rei, thus bowing to the leader of that day\u2019s class.\nOtagai ni rei (\u201cbow to the others\u201d): we all symbolically bow to each other by bowing forward. This is a way of giving thanks to everyone for being present and helping us learn karate.\nAfter we bow, the instructor will tell us to stand up and form a circle.\nSometimes we just do standing bows. The instructor will simply turn around to face the front of the room. He will call out Shomeni-rei. We will all bow from a standing position (heels together feet out, hands straight at our sides) together and come up together (after the instructor). He then will turn to face us and will say \"Rei\" (which simply means \"bow\"). We will then all bow at the same time and come up at the same time.\nIf you arrive after class has begun, warm up and stretch on your own prior to entering the dojo. When you enter the dojo, bow upon entry, put your things down, then sit in seiza position and do your own mokuso. Once you have finished meditating,"}

Mr. Bowers is charged with murder and arson.\nMr. Pitts, now 54 and serving time for his part in the killing, told the jury that he and other Klansmen gathered in the winter of 1965 in a farmhouse near Laurel, Miss., for a special meeting -- special because Mr. Bowers, the Imperial Wizard who led the Mississippi White Knights, had come to order Mr. Dahmer's death.\nMr. Pitts testified that Mr. Bowers, now 73, ordered the killing because Mr. Dahmer had worked to register blacks to vote.\nMr. Pitts said Mr. Bowers was angry at the meeting because the Forrest County Klan had done nothing to silence Mr. Dahmer, a merchant, farmer and local N.A.A.C.P. official who offered his small store in the Kelly Settlement community outside Hattiesburg as a place where blacks could pay the poll tax.\nMr. Pitts said Mr. Bowers, a businessman in Laurel, later told him: ''Don't worry. No jury in the state of Mississippi is going to convict a white man for killing'' a black.\nHe said that Mr. Bowers presided over other meetings where Klansmen planned the firebombing of Mr. Dahmer's house and store, and that Travis Buckley, Mr. Bowers's lawyer in this trial, also attended meetings to plan the firebombing.\nThat prompted an outburst from Mr. Buckley, who demanded a mistrial.\n''It's so inflammatory,'' said Mr. Buckley, who was indicted in the Dahmer case three decades ago but was cleared of all charges.\nThe prosecutor, Robert Helfrich, said that his office had filed a motion before the trial pointing out a possible conflict of interest if Mr. Buckley tried the case, but that Mr. Bowers had insisted that Mr. Buckley represent him.\n''It's going to come up again that Mr. Buckley was there, by this witness and other witnesses,'' Mr. Helfrich said.\nJudge Richard McKenzie denied the mistrial motion but told jurors to disregard what they had heard about Mr. Buckley.

{"idx": "36265", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Last month, Microsoft rolled out the first major Windows 10 update for PCs and tablets. Today, the company is detailing one of the security improvements included within: Microsoft SmartScreen can now block drive-by attacks.\nMicrosoft SmartScreen is a security filter that is leveraged by a few of the company\u2019s products, including Internet Explorer and Edge. Since SmartScreen\u2019s release as part of IE7, the feature has protected users from \u201cbillions\u201d of web-based attacks, the company said. It blocks phishing attacks and socially engineered malware, as well as warns of deceptive advertisements and scam sites.\nNow SmartScreen can also handle drive-by attacks, which are essentially scenarios where you\u2019re browsing on a trusted site but something manages to exploit a vulnerability in your browser or some other software without you doing anything. That means you don\u2019t have to click on anything, download, or execute a malicious file.\nDrive-by attacks make use of services known as exploit kits (EKs) to scale effectively. These are tools that first check your PC for software vulnerabilities (tracked publicly as CVEs) and then try to exploit them. The vulnerabilities can be either newly discovered ones \u2014 also known as 0-days \u2014 or ones that have already been fixed in popular software. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen EKs moving faster to target vulnerabilities in apps with available patches, while also exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities more frequently as well.\nMicrosoft uses data from Edge, IE, Bing, Windows Defender, and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) to spot these attacks \u201cas they emerge.\u201d SmartScreen can thus block drive-by attacks directly in the browser, preventing the device from getting infected, potentially even before a patch is available.\nYou might be wondering why it took Microsoft eight years to add such functionality. The company explained that all the threats SmartScreen has protected against until now can be blocked after web content is parsed and rendered.\nSmartScreen can also warn you about potentially malicious frames, such as unsafe ads. Unsafe frames on a page used to result in a full-page warning, even if the webpage hosting the content was safe, but now SmartScreen can show you warnings for only the frames that are found to be malicious.\nIn this way, you can keep browsing the page even if it has malicious ads included, for example.\nAnd of course, similar to Google\u2019s Safe Browsing service (leveraged by Chrome and Firefox), you can skip the warnings. Just expand the More Information link on the SmartScreen warning page to bypass the warning or even report a site as safe to Microsoft. For warnings shown in frames, you can click the Unsafe Content badge in the address bar for the same options.\nOn the flipside, Windows 10 users can report sites they think are unsafe directly to Microsoft in both IE11 (tap or click the Tools button, point to Safety, and then choose Report unsafe website) and Edge (tap or click the More menu, choose Send feedback, and then choose Report unsafe website).\nThis is a big improvement on Microsoft\u2019s part, though we can\u2019t help but wish it was available to more users. Still, if you haven\u2019t upgraded to Windows 10 yet, this is yet another reason you should take the plunge."}

Beginning with the oh-so-Floyd-sounding \u201cAlpha State,\u201d Dim Side Of Mars continues the cosmic journey throughout the universe of music with Rex Carroll\u2019s strings doing an admirable job of filling in for David Gilmour and Rene LeDesma providing his best Roger Waters impersonation (it\u2019s much better than Corey Feldman\u2019s imitation of Waters, I\u2019ll tell you that for certain).\nThe album\u2019s message is blatantly clear: humanity\u2019s apathy towards itself\u2013and Dim Side Of Mars\u2019 remaining six tracks attempt to free us from our own mental prisons brought on by war, technology, and religion.

This year, pirates have widened their range of operations as far down as Mozambique Channel and as far east as India.\nIn an interview with VOA one year ago, the director of the International Maritime Bureau in London, Pottengal Mukundun, expressed concerns about pirates venturing hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Somalia and threatening vessels in the region of the Seychelles and Comoros Islands.\nMukundun says, this year, pirates have extended their reach to threaten just about any vessel sailing in the northern half of the Indian Ocean.\n\"I think the whole of the Indian Ocean north of Mauritius and Madagascar is [an] area, where ships should continue to be on alert,\" he said. \"The attack, which took place about 66 degrees east recently, was the first time an attack had taken place so far east. There was at least one mother ship there. So, they were able to operate in that area and they took the first ship that they attacked.\"\nAt the time it was seized on March 22, the vessel, a Turkish-owned, Maltese-flagged bulk carrier with a crew of 21 sailors, was about 5,000 kilometers off the coast of Somalia, close to India. The U.S. Navy says another pirate mother ship was recently spotted down in the Mozambique Channel, a waterway between Mozambique and the island-nation of Madagascar.\nMother ships are often hijacked vessels used to transport pirates far out into the open sea. From these mother ships, pirates launch small, fast attack boats to pursue a vessel, go alongside it and board it.\nThe International Maritime Bureau has long called for international navies patrolling the Somali coast to target mother ships rather than trying to intervene during an attack. Mukundun says he remains convinced that going after mother ships is the only way to counter the growing menace of piracy, especially in the Indian Ocean.\n\"I think it still remains the only tactical response in the Indian Ocean. It is such a vast area. The pirates have suffered setbacks in the last four to five weeks because the French, the Dutch, and other navies have actually identified mother ships, pursued them and sunk some of the small mother ships. So, those are all positive signs,\" Mukundun added.\nSince early 2009, foreign navies have been patrolling and providing escorts for commercial vessels, mostly in the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden, a vital shipping lane between Somalia and Yemen. But their forces are stretched and unable to respond to every distress call.\nAbout 16 vessels, including eight Indian-owned dhows with more than 100 crew members, have been seized in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden since the beginning of March. Ransom demand for each vessel and its crew has jumped to about $3 million from an average of $1 million a year ago.\nSome commercial ships have hired armed private security to deter piracy. In the first recorded incident of its kind, a private security guard on board a merchant ship shot and killed a pirate last week during an attack.\nThe use of armed security guards is controversial amid fears in the shipping industry that having guns aboard vessels could lead to violence that endangers the crew."}

It\u2019s not like it\u2019s not there, but it\u2019s more like a \u2018demand and supply thing\u2019. People want to hear music in a particular way and it\u2019s a trend. I feel it\u2019s time that music directors start setting their own trend rather than following one, because I feel there is so much talent in our country. There are so many music directors, who are new, young and talented. I feel there will be a turnaround, not just in Bollywood, but in the non-Bollywood space as well, which is growing slowly. There are so many new artistes on the other side of the fence.\nYou too were a huge part and a big hit in the 90s during the Indi-pop scene. What do you miss the most about that time?\nI miss the freedom to create your own songs and music and having listeners who would support new artistes, who didn\u2019t have a Bollywood backing. There was a time when even music channels were about music. There were so many bands performing across the country, having a good time. That time was great. I think somewhere down the line, people jumped the bandwagon wanting to make a splash and getting noticed. A lot of us, who did really well with our first albums, got sucked into Bollywood. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing to do playback singing but my aim was to do my own album. But when I got into Bollywood, my mindset was different. I wanted to try different things in playback. The more I did it, the more I enjoyed it because I got to do great songs. Then I really enjoyed myself and thought that I will postpone my album, but I didn\u2019t realize that my next album happened after nine years. You don\u2019t realize the time because you enjoy the ride, it\u2019s a great trip. But somewhere, I felt that the artiste in me suffered, not the vocalist, but the artiste and that\u2019s what am trying to rediscover now. For 22 years I\u2019ve done this, but now I want to get back to my zone.\nIs that also the reason why you are doing fewer Bollywood numbers now?\nYes, that is one of the reasons. To rediscover yourself, you need to make a few changes in yourself. I need to take my time, rethink creatively. When you are working with someone else, you are working on a clean slate trying to recreate things. But when you work for yourself, it begins from the scratch.\nYou\u2019ve sung in Kannada films earlier. Are there any more songs in the pipeline?\nI\u2019ve sung a"}
{"idx": "36285", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The following is a sermon I preached at Clackamas United Church of Christ, near Portland, Oregon. You can read or watch the sermon below. The primary scripture texts were Isaiah 6:1-13 and Luke 5:1-11.\nAnd I want to pause here for a minute, because whenever ancient Jews talked about \u201cdeep water\u201d it was code word for chaos.\nThe water, the ocean, the lake, any body of water, was chaotic. You never knew if the water was going to be calm one minute and chaotic the next minute. We see this in the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis chapter 1. The waters of the earth were chaotic and the spirit of God hovers over the water to bring order.\nOur ancient ancestors associated water with chaos. The waters of the earth can be very dangerous. The Jews made this association, but so did many others. The ancient Babylonians, for example, thought that a god named Tiamat was the god of the sea. Tiamat was a god of chaos. You never knew if the god Tiamat, and thus the sea, was going to be calm and peaceful or chaotic and deadly.\nAnd here is Jesus sending the people out into the sea. Out into chaos.\nThose who first heard this story would have heard the symbolism in this story. There is chaos in the world. And that\u2019s where Jesus is sending us.\nCan you relate? Do you ever feel like the world is in chaos?\nThat\u2019s how Jesus first disciples felt. They were safe on the land and shore. And yet, Jesus sent them back into the chaos.\nBut the sea wasn\u2019t just a symbol of chaos. That night it was also was also empty. The fishermen were out in the sea all night and they didn\u2019t catch a thing. There were no fish.\nIt was chaotic, dangerous, and, even worse, pointless for them to go back into the sea. They were exhausted after a long night of pointless fishing. And now Jesus told them to go back. One of the fishermen, a man named Simon, told Jesus that they fished all night and caught nothing. Simon just finished cleaning his nets, which was quite an ordeal in itself. Simon felt that it was pointless and hopeless. But he also trusted Jesus and went back into the sea.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I feel especially jaded, cynical, and hopeless when it comes to the chaos of our current political environment. Our political situation is dominated by lies and scapegoating. From the top down it\u2019s chaotic and it\u2019s meant to be chaotic so that we constantly move from one scandal to the next.\nGuess what. Jesus comes to us exactly in these situations and says, \u201cGet up. Get back in your boat. Go into the chaos and catch some fish. Because the world doesn\u2019t need any more cynicism. The world doesn\u2019t need any more lies and scapegoating. The world needs hope. The world needs the truth of the Gospel that says God loves you and me and calls us to love one another as we love ourselves and work for a more just world for all people.\nI\u2019m the first to admit that this isn\u2019t easy, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s important. We live in a culture that runs on lies and scapegoating, as opposed to a culture that emphasizes love of neighbor.\nIn our Hebrew Scripture lesson this morning, Isaiah meets God, who sends Isaiah on a mission.

I had actually never heard of the [\u201cRunaways\u201d] comic, but once I got the role, I then did some research on what \u201cRunaways\u201d was and what \u201cRunaways\u201d meant to people.\nHow was the project initially introduced to you?\nI found out about the role when my team sent me the audition. I didn\u2019t know what the project was for, I didn\u2019t know who was involved, and it was a fake character name. Once I tested, I called Josh Schwartz because they wanted me to sign on to something for seven years that I didn\u2019t know anything about. I was like, \u201cJosh, you\u2019re asking me to sign a seven-year contract without having read a single thing.\u201d But he has a great way of convincing people, so here I am.\nWhat did he say that convinced you?\nHe kept on reiterating that the show is shot in LA, and I have lived here for nine years, so to sleep in my own bed was a big attraction.

Josh is amazing at that. They have a very interesting dynamic. Josh is very, very outgoing and fun, and Stephanie is a little more of a straight shooter. She\u2019s a little quiet, but when she has something to say, it\u2019s one, very educated, and two, very important. Their dynamic works perfectly together. The main thing I learned from them is always how to treat crew members when you\u2019re in a position of power. They are so lovely to everyone they work with in every department. And I want to get into the production side of things, so to have Josh as a person I can ask questions and be educated by, that\u2019s a big plus for me.\n\u201cRunaways\u201d is very rooted in 2017.

I've downloaded a wifi analyser app and the wireless signal seems to stay connected, but its difficult to test/observe as it's intermittent and only for several seconds. The event viewer in Windows is logging the internet as unavailable for around 14seconds, about four times an hour.\nDoes anyone have any advice or has encountered similar issues with these 3.0 routers?\nOr should I log this with Virgin for an engineer?\nCould be a circuit problem. Go into your hub on 192.168.0.1 and post your up/down stream stats and network log.\nAs well as posting up the hub data, check that all your coax connections are in nice and \"finger\" tight at the Hub and the wall box and at any splitters/attenuators/etc and that the internal wiring is ok with no kinking or chaffing (rabbit chews!). Also check that all looks good with the outside cabling and wall box.\nMy internet connection and up/down speed seem fine, which is why I'm (optimistically) assuming it's a problem with a specific piece of hardware/setting rather than just an overloaded network that occasionally tips over the edge.\nI have no idea what any of those router error messages mean, but none of those error timestamps coincide with my network outages. For example, looking at my windows event logs (in Application and Service Logs> Microsoft> Windows> UniversalTelemetryClient> Operational), event ID 55: \"Is the Internet available: false\" occurred 14 times between 10:30am and 12:30pm, each showing as having reconnected 14 seconds later.\nThanks for offering advice on this.\nWhile you are at it... set up a BQM for monitoring your connection 24/7 at..\nThis is the area where I am assuming I wont get past a helpdesk phone call, which is why it's taken me a month to get around to doing this and I'm trying to fix the problem myself first before going through the hasstle.\nWe are currently living in a house we are renovating - upstairs is finished, which is where we're living as a flat, downstairs is still mostly a building site, which is where the broadband is connected.

Plenty of room for there to be a dodgy connection.\nAll of the cables seem fine. I have just ordered a couple more cat5e cables to test with in case this is the problem, and I will set up a computer in the same room as the router next week to test it's not the house network points we have installed.\nThe reason I'm spending more time now trying to troubleshoot this as a router problem before setting up a PC in the building site to wire directly to the router to test that, is that the fault isn't behaving like a dodgy cabling problem. The outages are too regular, for too regular and short a length of time, and reliably reconnect themselves after several seconds.\nChecking the cabling and rewiring the network points etc. is my stage after this"}

Kavanaugh has only one major abortion ruling in his 12 years on the federal bench, but that forceful opinion will define the coming debate on what his elevation to the Supreme Court would mean for a woman\u2019s constitutional right to the procedure.\nAntiabortion activists say they are assured, without specific evidence in his writings, that President Trump\u2019s second nominee could provide the long-sought final piece to a Supreme Court majority that would allow far more restrictions on abortion \u2014 and perhaps even overturn the court\u2019s abortion rights precedents that began 45 years ago in Roe v. Wade.\nOn this, abortion rights advocates agree with their opponents, and they point to the strongly worded dissent Kavanaugh issued last fall in a case involving a pregnant immigrant teenager in federal custody.\nBefore his dissent, Kavanaugh fashioned what he considered a compromise to juggle competing interests in the contentious and emotional case. That decision provides a detailed view of how he might approach abortion issues on the high court \u2014 and offers a glimpse of a judge who said he was striving to find middle ground on divisive issues.\nWhat could happen if Roe v Wade gets struck down?\nStill, a majority of Kavanaugh\u2019s colleagues on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said his solution was hardly neutral and reversed his order.\nKavanaugh said he had \u201caccommodated the competing interests\u201d by balancing Supreme Court precedent that prohibits government from placing an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman seeking an abortion while acknowledging its interest in protecting \u201cfetal life.\u201d It would further delay the teenager\u2019s abortion, he conceded, but could ultimately allow her to end the pregnancy \u201cif she so chooses\u201d without the government\u2019s involvement.\nJudge Patricia A. Millett said Kavanaugh had misconstrued the meaning of an \u201cundue burden\u201d by allowing a further delay of the teen\u2019s abortion that already had been put off by the government for weeks.\n\u201cThere is nothing expeditious about the prolonged and complete barrier to J.D.\u2019s exercise of her right to terminate her pregnancy that [Kavanaugh\u2019s] order allowed the government to perpetuate,\u201d wrote Millett, using the initials for Jane Doe, as the teen was identified in court papers.\nIn his dissent, Kavanaugh accused his colleagues of creating \u201ca new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\u201d The phrase \u2014 \u201cabortion on demand\u201d \u2014 is part of the antiabortion lexicon.\nKavanaugh\u2019s opinion brought expected criticism from the left. But there were conservative critics, too, who said he should have gone further, as another judge on the D.C. Circuit did, in declaring that an immigrant teen has no constitutional right to abortion.\nCatherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said she did not agree with those critics, saying the question of the teen\u2019s constitutional right hinged on immigration law, not abortion access.\n\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to imagine what his position on that issue would be if he was on the high court,\u201d she said.\nDuring his 2006 confirmation hearing to the appellate bench, Kavanaugh said he accepted the precedential value of Roe \u2014 a statement expected of lower-court judges.

{"idx": "36312", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Another Wall Street analyst out today speculating that Apple\u2019s got a new tablet-like gadget/computer that will be hitting the market sometime early next year. Let\u2019s analyze.\nFirst off, we can certainly expect that Apple\u2019s got some new gadget/tablet/computer hardware products that they will be rolling out to the market in 2010. I mean, come on, is anybody really going out on a limb by saying they expect Apple\u2019s got some new consumer hardware products that they\u2019ll start selling next year? No.\nThis company and its brilliant (but option-backdating scandalous) CEO are most definitely going to roll out some new hardware next year. And while I recently wrote an article about how we should be able to buy the iPhone at Verizon by Christmas next year, I also think the company\u2019s likely rolling out some other new tablet-like hardware that the Wall Street analysts were crowing about today. The $1000 price tag that\u2019s being reported as the MSRP for such a product wouldn\u2019t shock me either, but really, it\u2019s likely there will be more than one tablet and price point that will be offered.\nSome people have taken to calling this new tablet-like gadget from Apple a \u201cgame-changer\u201d, but I\u2019m not one of them. I do think the Wall Street analyst\u2019s note today is right in which he calculates that a new tablet-like gadget would add more than 25 cents per share to the company\u2019s earnings per quarter \u2014 perhaps a billion dollars of sales for any such new product over the next couple years. But I\u2019m not sure a product that would sell a few million units next year is really much of a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Rather, a new tablet-like gadget from Apple would be more of a \u201cgame enhancer\u201d and another step for the company in its drive to make its operating system and hardware products the de facto standard of platforms for next gen applications.\nOkay, okay, what did I mean by that last sentence? In my Revolutionomics class at Seton Hall, I always talk about how important it is for technology companies to create a proprietary \u201cplatform\u201d. Platforms like the iPhone/iTouch operating systems that all those \u201capps\u201d work on can be a key to long-term profits in technology. If you\u2019re a developer and you have a great idea for a new GPS-basketball app that tells the consumer where every basketball hoop in the area is (by the way, you\u2019d probably use the Google Map app as a secondary platform upon which you build the app), then you\u2019ve got to choose \u2013 am I going to develop this app first for iPhone/iTouch/Apple-gadget people? Or for the Droid platform from Google? Or for the Windows Mobile platform from Microsoft? Or for the Blackberry platform from RIMM?\nAnd if Apple can get enough products based on the same platform as the iPhone/iTouch are built on into the consumers\u2019 hands around the world, then the Apple platform would become at least a similar type of de facto standard as the Windows platform was for computers in the 1990s.\nPlatform races often result in a couple of very big winners and lots and lots of losers. Developers want to develop apps for the platform with the most users and consumers want to buy products with the most apps offered for them. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle for those who hit critical mass and a vicious cycle for those who fail to hit critical mass.\nApple\u2019s got critical mass already with the iPhone and iTouch becoming ever more popular and getting ever closer to true \u201ccritical mass\u201d to make their platform the runaway de facto standard.

Under Risk Rating 2.0, a home at the edge of a 100-year floodplain might see a more than 50 percent reduction in rates, while a more vulnerable home in the same zone could see rates double, according to Bloomberg.\n\"While our current system accounts for a single flood hazard, our new system will determine a customer\u2019s flood risk by incorporating multiple, logical rating variables like different types of flood, the distance a building is from the coast or another water source and the cost to rebuild a home or building,\" David Maurstad, chief executive of the NFIP, said in an email statement to The Post and Courier.\nFEMA officials are expected to announce more detail on the new risk determination program next week. It's the biggest attempt in at least seven years at reforming the NFIP, which has struggled to stay solvent since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and is now tens of billions of dollars in debt.\nRegular homeowner's insurance does not cover flooding because it's a particularly expensive type of disaster to insure. A fire might hit only one house on a street, but if a flood comes, it inevitably covers a large area, setting up an insurer to pay out many claims at once.\nThat's a challenge to the very idea of insurance: spreading out cost among many ratepayers so that the pool of money produced can cover claims that occur sporadically, or in relatively low numbers.\nAt the same time, the NFIP has proved a massively important financial safety net for homeowners, said Samatha Medlock, of international insurance and risk assessment group Willis Towers Watson.\nAfter a severe storm, a property owner relying purely on disaster assistance receives an average of $4,000 in aid, Medlock said; a flood-insured owner receives an average $110,000.\n\"Which survivor do you want to be?\" she said.\nThe Lowcountry is particularly dependent on the federal flood program. Since 1978, two-thirds of the NFIP claims in South Carolina have come from Charleston.\nThere are some components of the program that help communities avoid flood risk, however. The maps themselves are an important tool for considering building rules and growth patterns, Medlock said.\nLocal governments can also lower rates for people in their communities through the Community Rating System, which offers breaks in exchange for regulations aimed at avoiding flood damage, like requiring that vulnerable homes be built higher.\nFEMA officials did not respond to a question on how the new program might affect that incentive system.\nChanges to the flood program, while typically aimed at improving its finances, often face a politically difficult path after they're enacted. A reform passed in 2012 proved a shock to local homeowners when it went into effect the following year. Skyrocketing rates put some in the position of not being able"}

Although a relatively small major, Jacobs said it fills a niche for companies looking to diversify their sales ranks and also gives nursing and other students who take some of the courses an inside look at how to sell knowledgeably and ethically.\nQ: What is your mission and how does this role fit you?\nA: I joined St. Kate\u2019s in 2013. My mission is to provide career-ready sales graduates who can hit the ground running at large and small companies with practical experience in selling through classroom sales simulations, regional and national sales competitions and internships. I didn\u2019t necessarily aspire to the academic world, but this was a good fit for me. I\u2019ve got a good sales background. I liked managing employees. And to bring this to St. Kate\u2019s was a good fit. This is a great environment focused on developing women. We do a combination of guest speakers, whether experts in sales and negotiation, and I think they bring it to life.\nQ: What is the Center for Sales Innovation at St. Catherine University?\nA: The Center for Sales Innovation has a 16-year track record of helping women advance in sales talent excellence. We concentrate on three areas: a four-year degree in business-to-business and health care sales, a health care sales certificate; leadership forums for women and men in sales; and research in national sales trends. The center\u2019s undergraduate curriculum is benchmarked against the best talent expectations of corporations for continuous improvement and relevance. It is tailored to real-world selling through mentoring, shadowing and interning experiences with corporate partners.\nThe center offers cross-industry sales leadership opportunities for corporations, including customized training and a monthly sales executive forum for local sales leaders. Men and women. These opportunities result in sales leaders\u2019 involvement with our sales undergraduates through classroom speaking, buyer-seller role-playing, sales competition preparation and career preparation support. Our research has examined various topics, including the best practices of high-performance women in sales \u2026 and how to effectively \u2018onboard\u2019 millennials.\nQ: How is the program unique?\nA: The center started in 1998 as a direct result of corporations recognizing that their sales work forces had been predominately comprised of white males. 3M was a founding partner and provided financial support as well as curriculum development to launch the center. Strategic partners have also included: Wells Fargo, ING, Ameriprise Financial, Pfizer, Northwest Airlines, Ecolab, Tennant, Mead Johnson Nutrition. \u2026 The purpose is to create a diverse pool of potential employees, educated to work effectively in complex selling situations. Listening is as important as speaking. And problem-solving as important as persuasion. Students learn to manage the value proposition of a company, not just how to sell products.

But a core group of regular clients have been key to the salon\u2019s success.\nAlthough building a new salon has been daunting, the Hanover residents say the construction served as an advertisement for their store.

But there might be good reasons for athletes to wear it anyway.\nUS figure skater Mirai Nagasu stunned Winter Olympics figure skating watchers over the weekend with her impressive performance \u2014 she was the first American woman to ever land a triple axel at the Olympics.\nBut the other part of her performance that stuck with viewers was the dark streak on her thigh with the letters \"USA\" on it. There was at first some speculation that it might be a tattoo of some kind, but it was soon revealed that it was actually Team USA-branded athletic kinesiology tape made by KT Tape.\nIn this year's Winter Games, some alpine skiers have also been wearing the tape on their faces to protect themselves from the freezing air. KT Tape is capitalizing on the moment by offering discounts on the \"mystery tattoo\" tape.\nThe KT Tape company web site says the tape is \"designed to relieve pain while supporting muscles, tendons, and ligaments.\"\nBut the science on whether Kinesio tape actually works isn't clear. Wearing it may be beneficial for Olympic athletes \u2014 but not necessarily for the reason the competitors choose to put it on.\nHopefully Ted Ligety doesn't have too hard a time removing tape from his face.\nKinesiology tape, which is often brightly colored, has made a splash at the Olympics and in other sporting events before. It started to draw viewers' attention at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Games, where it was often quite visible on the exposed skin of beach volleyball players.\nRecently, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady showed up for the AFC Championship Game wearing KT Tape. He was using it protect stitches he'd received to treat a gash in his right hand.\nThe KT Tape website claims the product \"helps reduce pressure to the tissue and may reduce discomfort or pain. Correct taping also provides support to muscles by improving the muscle's ability to contract, even when it is weak, and helps the muscle to not over-extend or over-contract.\"\nKinesio Tex Tape, which is what athletes were first spotted wearing in 2008, was designed by a Japanese chiropractor in 1979. Kinesio's website says their tape \"alleviates discomfort and facilitates lymphatic drainage by microscopically lifting the skin.\" They say that it can be \"applied over muscles to reduce pain and inflammation, relax overused or tired muscles, and support muscles in movement on a 24-hour-a-day basis.\"\nWhether or not the tape actually does these things is less clear. And athletes seem to be wearing it for a variety of reasons that go beyond the marketing \u2014 face-warming certainly isn't one of the recommended uses.\nMost of us first noticed the tape on beach volleyball players.\nSeveral reviews of studies have analyzed the clinical use of kinesio taping for people with musculoskeletal conditions, and found no evidence it helped patients.

Sixteen years of political talk show experience, with its heated discussions, irate phone calls and protests, can numb a man to personal attacks. But even an all-out assault from the staunchest of Republicans couldn't have prepared Bob for Leland Ingham.\nWhen Bob agreed to play golf with some buddies at Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase on that summer day in 1990, he didn't realize he would meet his match -- both as a golfer and a soulmate.\nLeland tells the story best: \"I was asked to come play golf with these guys I normally played golf with on Fridays. I showed up and they had invited Bob to play, and I didn't know who Bob was. I showed up on the first tee of Columbia and put my ball down on the whites, which is the men's tee, and he said, 'The ladies' tee is up there.' I said, 'Oh, it's all right, I'll just hit from here. No big deal.' So I hit the ball probably 230 [yards] right down the middle. He gets up and tops it right down the hill. We played the round of golf and get to the 18th hole. I had clearly beaten him by many, many strokes [32 by Bob's recollection]. And I picked his ball up out of the hole and threw it at him and said, 'Next time, maybe you ought to play from the red tees.'\"\nWhat Bob didn't know at the first tee was that Leland was a very talented golfer on the Futures Tour. What Leland didn't know was that Bob was a well-known political analyst who was the campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in the 1984 election. But, then again, Leland didn't much care. All she saw was a pompous chauvinist who needed to be put in his place.\n\"That's the kind of thing I like,\" said Bob, 51, who married Leland two years later and now has two children (Alex, 7, and MacKenzie, 5) with his golf superior. \"She wasn't intimidated by the fact that I was on TV. ... My friend told her, 'This is Bob Beckel. He's got a show on Fox.' She was totally unimpressed. The fact that she had the gall to throw my ball at me and say that, I thought that was right down my alley.\"\nLeland, 34, of Bethesda, has always had a knack for swinging a golf club; now she is tackling a new challenge: Coaching others to do the same. Last month, she was hired as the coach of the fledgling women's golf program at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

In an effort to \"reinforce the powerful master brand of Nokia\" and \"unify\" its brand architecture, all Ovi services are being rebranded as Nokia services.\nThe transition will begin in July, and Nokia hopes to see it completed across all countries and all services by year's end, Jerri DeVard, Nokia's executive vice president and CMO, said in a May 16 statement. New phones will arrive sans Ovi branding, and current Nokia owners will eventually see the branding phased out through software updates.\n\"The reasons for this decision includes the fact that Nokia is a well-known and highly loved brand the world over. Our mobile experiences are tightly integrated with our devices-there is no longer a differentiation,\" DeVard said. \"These last few years, and moving forward, our mission remains unchanged: we will continue our work to deliver compelling, unified mobile service offerings and next-generation, disruptive technologies.\"\nThe greatest change to the Nokia brand, however, since Stephen Elop left Microsoft to take on the CEO role at the mobile phone vendor in September 2010, has been the redirection of its operating system priorities from Symbian to Microsoft. In February, Elop warned that it would require some previously unthinkable measures to save the company, which for a number of quarters has lost market share to the Apple iPhone and Android-running smartphones. Days later Elop, with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, announced the new deal, which will bring Windows Phone-running Nokia smartphones to market by 2012.\nElop has said that, more than creating an iPhone killer, Nokia's comeback plan entails offering handsets for every price category-a strategy that some analysts believe will pay off.\"We believe that Nokia and Microsoft are a very powerful tandem, and that will show in its full force by 2013,\" Stela Bokun, senior analyst with Pyramid Research, wrote in a May 9 report. \"Lower price of the devices will be the crucial prerequisite for the expansion of WP models.

Messier earned this moniker through his habit of coming through in the clutch. After leading his old team, the Edmonton Oilers to a bevy of Stanley Cup championships over the prior decade, he had done the impossible, and led the New York Rangers to a championship all their own in 1994.\nThere's a new \"Money Man\". Actually, not really all that new. These days, the term refers to Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) CEO Jeff Bezos, the planet's richest man. Yesterday, Bezos made news, a ton of news. First, he and his wife MacKenzie announced the formation of the Bezos Day One Fund that will support existing organizations that aid homeless families. The new fund will also create a network of pre-schools in low income areas. Bezos has committed $2 billion of his estimated personal wealth of $164 billion to this new charity interest, and has clearly shown an increased interest in philanthropy of late.\nBezos spoke in Washington last night. Hopes were that he might mention his decision on a winner for where Amazon might locate their second corporate headquarters. Those hopes were dashed early on in the event when Bezos indicated on that he would answer that question by the end of the year. The crowd in attendance actually booed (somewhat good-naturedly) this avoidance.\nJeff Bezos was careful not to pick a fight with the president throughout the interview with David Rubenstein. In defense of his Washington Post, he did express his belief that it would be dangerous for any elected official to demonize the media, but that is about as far as he went on that. As far as Amazon (Bezos holds a 16% stake) goes, he expressed a broad understanding that large companies will come under regular scrutiny. He took a pass when asked about presidential tweets aimed at the firm. Basically, it seemed to be a \"stay out of trouble\" interview.\nRetailers call this firm the \"Death Star\". Cloud Kings call Amazon Web Services ... number one. This is the company that has forced Walmart (WMT - Get Report) to evolve just so they might compete. This is the firm that through Prime membership has created perhaps the most loyal customer base in history, not to mention the subscription economy. Speaking of Prime, Citigroup analyst Mark May mentioned Prime when he raised his target price on AMZN from $2100 to $2250 earlier this week.

{"idx": "36338", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Gold granite with pronounced striations.\n2 Which Color of Granite With Maple Cabinets?\nThe tonal variations in granite countertops produce a depth of color that easily coordinates with medium-brown wood. Medium brown usually has an orange undertone, which is its underlying hue bias. Along with the granite's overall hue, the colors of pronounced striations or evenly distributed flecks coordinate with various decor elements. For a unified look, choose granite that is a lighter shade of the wood's undertone color. Establish contrast by choosing a complementary granite color -- one that is a color wheel opposite of medium brown's undertone.\nWarm-gray granite provides a subtle contrast with medium-brown wood. In a kitchen with wood flooring, paint walls light warm-gray to complement the granite. Lighten the room by painting a kitchen island light warm-gray to blend with its granite top. Pewter or brushed chrome light fixtures coordinate with these hues, while accents in spring-green brighten the palette.\nFor an analogous color scheme, choose granite in a hue that is a color wheel neighbor of the wood's undertone, such as yellow, beige or gold. Orangish-gold granite with tiny flecks of green-gray coordinates smoothly with medium-brown wood since both have orange undertones. Greenish, brushed nickel pendant lights relate to the green-gray flecks, as does green-gray ceramic flooring.\nWith medium orange-brown wood, blue or green granite provides complementary contrast, especially cool-blue or cool-green granite. Consider lighter shades of green or blue, which display tonal as well as hue contrast. Light, greenish blue-gray countertops correspond with greenish slate-gray flooring, while bronze pendant lights relate to the orange-brown wood tone.\n, Anya. \"What Granite Color to Match Medium-Brown Cabinets?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/granite-color-match-mediumbrown-cabinets-81622.html.

{"idx": "36341", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In particular, a logo is a visual design element that works as a symbol of a company\u2019s goals, attitude, and target market. It represents a company and, if chosen well, can work wonders for your business. Over time, a well-chosen logo becomes synonymous with your company and will take you a long way. Think of McDonald\u2019s golden arches, or Coca Cola\u2019s famous red and white swirl design, and you\u2019ll understand the power of a logo.\nWhen designing your website and trying to select a fitting logo, there are many features to consider, so take the time to find just the right one \u00ad it\u2019ll be worth it. Remember: a good logo works simultaneously to convey a professional first impression to new customers and strengthen brand loyalty in returning ones.\nFirst, decide what kind of logo suits your business best. Some companies make use of text-based logos, for example. With this type of logo a unique look is achieved by creating a distinctive font and color combination that sets it apart - this is called a type treatment.\nAnother type of logo illustrates exactly what the company does through graphic representation. For instance, if your business sells ice cream your logo might be the picture of a triple-scoop ice cream cone. This type of logo works well for businesses that can be easily summed up in a specific piece of imagery.\nLastly, a logo can be abstract. It could be a curly line, a shape or something in that vein, which represents the company brand. This type of logo takes time and money to be effective, as it starts off meaning nothing \u00ad only when a company grows and becomes more well-known can this type of logo come to symbolize the product you are selling. For the start-up company looking to gain exposure and break into the business world, a logo that clearly sums up your business is probably a better choice.\nSelecting an appropriate logo will take some time and effort, but it is this crucial initial investment that will ensure your company\u2019s logo will do its job over the long term. You might start off by brainstorming about the image your company represents, or the message you want to express to the public. This will help you focus on what\u2019s important about your company\u2019s product and come up with an apt visual representation of all it stands for.\nNext, check out the competition to discover what you\u2019re up against. What logos do other businesses in your field use? Are they professional and formal or creative and flashy? Once you determine the image your competitors have established, seek to differentiate your own logo and separate yourself from the crowd. If your logo and corporate identity differ from everything else on the Internet, people will want to see what you\u2019re all about.\nKeep it simple. Don\u2019t go overboard when choosing a logo because this is always a big turnoff. Keep your logo crisp, clean, focused and easy-to-understand. It should also be functional and focus on the overall feel of your website and company in general.\nAlso consider how your business benefits your target market. Why do you provide the best product or service online? If you can convey this message easily and clearly through a graphical logo go ahead and do so. If your customers recognize your logo and associate it with the main crux of your product, they will bring you repeat business time and time again.\nChoose a logo that looks good in black and white. Colors are great, but when you need to send faxes or make photocopies the company logo needs to show up strong and clear for everyone to see.\nWhatever you do, stay away from clipart.

{"idx": "36345", "prompt": "Continue the following text: What Is Your Social Security Retirement Age?\nYour Social Security retirement age depends on the year you were born. Here's how to find yours and what it means to you.\nThis article was updated on Aug. 17, 2018, and originally published on December 4, 2016.\nYour Social Security retirement age, also referred to as your full or normal retirement age, depends on the year you were born and can be anywhere from 66 to 67 years of age. This is the age at which you can claim your full Social Security retirement benefit, and claiming before or after will result in a modified benefit amount. Here's what you need to know about your Social Security retirement age, what it means to you, and what could happen in the future.\nTo help improve Social Security's finances, Congress decided that the retirement age should be raised to 67. This has been phased in gradually, starting with retirees who were born in 1955.\nFull retirement age is important because it is the age to which you must wait in order to get your full Social Security retirement benefit.\nThere's a ceiling on your monthly benefit, too. For 2018, the maximum base benefit amount is $2,788.\nIf you choose to claims before your full retirement age, your benefit will be reduced. Up to 36 months early, your benefit will be reduced by 6-2/3% each year, or 5/9 of a percent per month. Beyond 36 months, your benefit will be further reduced by 5% per year, or 5/12 of a percent per month, as early as 62 years of age. Conversely, if you choose to wait past your full retirement age, your benefit will be permanently increased by 8% for every year you wait, up to a maximum of 70 years of age.\nFor reference, here's how early or late retirement would affect somebody born in 1960, whose full retirement age is 67, and whose full retirement benefit is $1500 per month.\nData source: Author's calculations, based on SSA information.\nWhat could happen to the retirement age in the future?\nIt's no big secret that Social Security isn't exactly in the best financial shape. The latest projections call for Social Security to run out of reserves by 2034, which would lead to substantial benefit cuts. There are two main types of changes Congress could make to prevent that: raising taxes or cutting benefits.\nRaising the retirement age would fall under the category of benefit cuts, but it seems rather unlikely to happen, even with the incoming Republican government. Benefit cuts are widely unpopular among all income levels, age groups, and political affiliations, so they are unlikely to gain serious political traction. What's more, raising the retirement age wouldn't do a lot to solve the problem. An analysis found that even a big increase to a full retirement age of 70 would only take care of 25% of the Social Security funding gap, while a 1% tax increase would make up for 52% of the problem and eliminating the taxable wage cap would pay for 74%.\nIn a nutshell, while an increase in the full retirement age is certainly possible, it's not the most likely outcome of the ongoing debate on to fix Social Security."}

Allow Gossip Cop to explain what\u2019s going on.\nWhile the webloid routinely publishes fake news about a range of celebrities, it has recently increased the number of stories about Styles. That\u2019s because with the singer releasing his debut solo album, the site knows there\u2019s increased in interest in the British star both personally and professionally. So by offering original content, even if it\u2019s made up, HollywoodLies can get traffic by duping fans and gaming Google.\nBut while regularly breaking the key journalism principle of accuracy, the outlet also rarely follows another tenant: Consistency. And by publishing contradictory stories, the online publication actually exposes itself as a fraud. Gossip Cop can demonstrate how by showing the timeline and content of claims related to Styles and Ward.\nAfter it was first reported the One Direction member was dating the British food blogger, HollywoodLies claimed to have an \u201cexclusive\u201d all about Styles\u2019 relationship with his \u201cnew chef girlfriend.\u201d In the article, the webloid alleged it knew private information about the romance, like how he supposedly serenades and cooks for Ward. The next day, though, the site was referring to her as Styles \u201crumored\u201d girlfriend. But didn\u2019t the blog just have details about their personal life together the day before?\nHow, then, to explain the publication\u2019s latest headline: \u201cHarry Styles Taking His Tess Ward Romance Slow: He\u2019s Focusing More On Solo Career.\u201d That exclusive was all about the two not being in an \u201cofficial\u201d relationship and Styles considering himself \u201csingle,\u201d with all his time being spent on music. If that\u2019s the case, why did HollywoodLies have a previous excusive about all the time Styles and Ward are spending together and what they do when they\u2019re alone? Naturally, though, while insisting nothing much is going to on between them, the blog also tried to cover itself by adding that Styles is \u201cdefinitely not willing to let her go.\u201d Huh?\nNone of the reports jive. In one article, Ward is his girlfriend and there\u2019s \u201cexclusive\u201d details. In the next, they\u2019re only \u201creportedly\u201d dating. Back and forth the webloid goes, and it\u2019s enough to give readers whiplash. The inconsistent takes prove what Gossip Cop has said all along: HollywoodLies doesn\u2019t have Styles sources. If it did, the site wouldn\u2019t constantly be reversing course and flip-flopping between dating and not dating. Its insiders, if they truly existed, would know one way or another what\u2019s really going on.\nAnd that\u2019s really what this is all about: Clickbait. That\u2019s why HollywoodLife named Styles its \u201cstar of the week\u201d earlier this month. That\u2019s why it keeps churning out stories about Ward, even if each new report contradicts the last. But far from showing that the publication really has Styles insight, all the inconsistency proves the outlet is just pretending, and poorly pretending at that. See the timeline of headlines below."}

Like many people, I relied heavily on refined carbohydrates, stimulants, and processed foods, without realising that these (cakes, bread, muffins, processed cereals, biscuit, chips, tinned soup and beans, processed cheese and meats) provided \u2018empty calories\u2019 which would rob my body of the nutrients that it needed.\nIn addition to this, my own experience of healthcare at the time of my bipolar diagnosis was centred around blood tests and drug treatment without attention to the impact my diet and lifestyle could have been having on my mental health. In 2015, and after several episodes of hypomania and depression, I decided to take control of my health qualifying as a nutritional therapist.\nWith the support of my husband I began to implement the principles of optimum nutrition into my life with dramatic results to my mental health. By focusing on the right diet I no longer experienced dramatic mood swings which allowed me to become medication free. I also enjoyed clearer skin, more energy, and reduced symptoms of PMS and irritable bowel syndrome.\nOut of my own experience the Rosie Rocks online health programme was born because I wanted to share the amazing effects of nutrition with others in the hope that they could feel as well and become as healthy as I am. Since October 2017 I have supported many people who, like me, were troubled with physical and mental health problems with amazing results.\nThe programme is simple \u2013 we eliminate refined, processed, cancer causing, and inflammatory foods, that stress our body replacing them with tasty nutritious foods and a healthy lifestyle. After every programme it is such a wonderful feeling to hear that people are experiencing the benefits of healthy living which includes more energy, less pain, balanced moods, clearer skin, improved sleep, and significant weight loss if that is their goal.\nThe Rosie Rocks programme is individually tailored to meet everyone\u2019s health needs providing everything they need to reach their goal \u2013 recipes and meal plans, daily nutrition advice and support, nutritional deficiency assessment, supplement advice, exercise tips, skincare advice, and a 24/7 online support group.\nMy hope as more people sign up for the programme, learn about nutrition, and reap the benefits from making positive changes to their life is that we can reduce symptoms, delay the onset, and in some cases even prevent the occurrence of many serious and debilitating health conditions such as cancer, bipolar, depression, fibromyalgia, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease.

When a fan hollered something at him as he walked to the locker room at halftime, Westbrook stopped abruptly, turned and yelled his displeasure. After the game, when his 46-point, 10-rebound outing wasn\u2019t enough to take down a Jazz team that was led by rookie Donovan Mitchell (38 points), Westbrook swiped at a fan who was leaning over the railing to videotape his exit.\nAfterward, Westbrook had no apologies for his actions.\n\"I don't confront fans, fans confront me,\" Westbrook told reporters. \"Here in Utah, man, a lot of disrespectful, vulgar things are said to the players here with these fans. It's truly disrespectful. (They) talk about your families, your kids. It's just a disrespect to the game and I think it's something that needs to be brought up.\nFrom Westbrook on down, the Thunder had all sorts of reasons to being frustrated as the series came to a close. It had been nearly four months since Westbrook said his free agency pitch to five-time All-Star Paul George would be a championship, and here they were failing to advance to the second round. George, who missed 14 of 16 shots and had just five points in the finale, has long been known to have interest in signing with his hometown Lakers. If he leaves, it would serve as a serious blow to the organization that lost former MVP Kevin Durant to the Golden State Warriors in the summer of 2016.\nOn Saturday, Westbrook addressed George's situation and contrasted it with Durant's free agency.\n\"Obviously, Kevin was here for many years and then decided to leave, and Paul's only been here for some months,\" Westbrook said. \"That's a decision that Paul will eventually make.\n\"But like I said before, our friendship and our bond we've created together is more important to me, and that's what I truly care about.

Unlike hosts and management companies that have begun building tiny rental empires in the cottage industry, Katz is not removing potential housing stock from the Market \u2014 a practice that has put local tenants' rights activists squarely in the anti-Airbnb corner. Instead, Katz is simply trying to make rent by hosting guests in his own living room.

The problem has gotten so bad that hosts have started covering their tracks by listing their rentals at the wrong location and hiring people to pretend they are real tenants rather than quick guests.

I am afraid that my position has been misunderstood. In my view, judicial activism may be justified in some instances but is unacceptable when it disregards reasonable Knesset legislation, assumes that everything is justiciable, ignores the separation of powers and turns the court into a player in the political and governmental arena.\nThe distinction between different types of judicial activism can be demonstrated by reference to two lines of cases, both discussed in my book and both equally praised in your editorial. In one of them the court recognized converts by non-Orthodox streams of Judaism who underwent their conversions abroad as coming within the Law of Return. In the other the court \u201cforce[d] a prime minister to fire ministers even though the law does not require him to do so.\u201d These cases raise completely different issues. The conversion cases are concerned with a legitimate and reasonable interpretation of Knesset legislation and I fully support the result reached.\nBut judicial legislation invented to force a prime minister to fire ministers belongs to an entirely different category.\nIt is a political issue that does not concern human rights in any way. The court\u2019s slide into determining the composition of the government constituted a grave violation of the separation of powers and led it straight into the political arena. The question is not whether the result is good or popular but whether the court was allowed to legislate criteria regarding the composition of the cabinet.\nIndeed, for many years it was understood that a minister need not resign if indicted (though they were of course free to do so). Thus, in 1980 a cabinet minister, Aharon Abuhatzeira, had been put on trial for financial offenses. He continued to serve in the cabinet during his trial and left the government only after his conviction. Although this was not an entirely satisfactory situation, it was in line with the presumption of innocence that prevailed at the time.\nIn 1993, during Rabin\u2019s second term as prime minister, the issue arose with regard to Arye Deri, leader of Shas Party, and deputy minister Raphael Pinchasi after a list of charges had been prepared against each (the charges against Pinchasi were less severe). It was clear that if Deri were forced to leave the government, Shas would leave the coalition, which would then lose its majority.\nRabin desperately needed Shas to remain in the coalition, especially as the government was then engaged in the highly sensitive and crucial negotiations \u2013 those relating to the Oslo agreements.\nNevertheless, at this most inopportune moment the Supreme Court invented a new, vague rule under which it could order the prime minister to fire a minister if the court considered it unreasonable not to do so.\nThe decision ordering Rabin to dismiss Deri and Pinchasi had a devastating effect on the government. Shas left the coalition, leaving the government without a majority, at a most sensitive time.\nTo survive no-confidence motions, pass legislation and further the Oslo agreements Rabin depended on the support of two Arab parties, which opened him up to accusations that, in matters relating to agreements with the Palestinians, he was beholden to Palestinian interests rather than the best interests of the Jewish state.\nLooking at the situation as a whole it was eminently reasonable for Rabin to abstain from dismissing Deri.

{"idx": "36369", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I have spent the past ten years working with kids in different contexts and there have been a few stand-out features to me. Kids have plenty of energy, they love to have fun, and they ask lots of questions. Lots of questions. About almost any topic.\nBut one thing that has really intrigued me over the years, and has been the topic of high interest amongst kids of all ages, is God. Whether it was in my job as an outdoor educator, in school scripture or at Sunday School, kids love to ask about God.\nWho made God? What is his favourite food? What is heaven like?\nHow can we trust the Bible? Why did Jesus have to die? If God loves us, why do people get sick?\nSo many great questions. And, from my experience, kids of all ages love getting to ask their questions about God, and love getting answers to their questions. It is like they are thirsty to know about God.\nSo, it got me wondering. Where do all these questions come from?\nIn our modern times, full of superheroes and singing princesses, isn't God boring? Why would a Year 6 boy prefer to sit and talk about God rather than go abseiling? It's like they almost have a desire implanted in them.\n'Question time with Dale' is often my students' favourite part of the scripture lesson. Why? Because they want to know about God.\nWhatever world view we hold to, it is hard to deny that we all have a yearning for something more, whether we call that God or not. This is very obvious in kids.\nScripture in schools is one of those few opportunities that kids have - in a safe, familiar environment - to satisfy their curiosity. To ask their questions. To quench their thirst.\nScripture is not about teaching kids right from wrong (although it is a part of it), it is about teaching kids about God. It is not about teaching kids how to make good decisions (although the implications flow), it is helping them understand their spirituality.\nThis is why ethics will never be a good replacement for scripture, for they are trying to do different things. Ethics (which I have no problems with) aims to teach kids how to make decisions. Scripture aims to teach kids how to know their God.\nDoes God belong in schools? Of course.\nTo take Him out is to deny our kids the opportunity to ask the questions that are embedded deep within. Whether they accept or reject Him, we at least owe it to our kids to teach them holistically.\nThey want to know about God. Who are we to deprive them?\nYoung children are curious about most things, especially fantasies involving magic. Of course they are. Of course the Bible has entertaining stories, they've been passed down for up to 10,000 years. Noah getting on an ark and God drowning 99% of all species is truly an amazing story. It's virtue is its fantasy, not it's truth - it never happened - are you teaching children that it did happen or as an allegorical tale? Incredible stories are not evidence in favour of pushing YOUR religion on to them. It indicates they are curious and like great stories - it should not provide a licence for priests to teach myths as if they are truth and to attempt to gain disciplines. Which is why you are there - why not just admit it? Muhammad ascending to heaven on a winged horse is an incredible story - do you tell that one? This reflects an unrepresentative and undemocratic policy given 80% of Australians feel religion has no importance in society. Also reflected by the fact that less than 1"}

The 342 homicides the city experienced in 2017 were a 17 percent increase over the prior year, and translated to a rate of 56 killed per 100,000 people.\nThat easily outpaced New Orleans and Detroit, which both had about 40 killings per 100,000 people, according to the report.\nBaltimore had more homicides last year than New York City, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, all considerably larger cities. Only Chicago, also a considerably larger city, had more.\nThe Sun correctly points out that these numbers can be a bit misleading. The USA Today study was limited to the fifty largest American cities by population, which means that only cities with close to a half million people made the list. In term of per capita carnage, there\u2019s more blood being shed in smaller locales. The city which probably deserved top honors was St. Louis. They managed to rack up 205 homicides, only 37 less than Baltimore while having a population less than half the size.\nUsually, when talking about the most dangerous cities in the country, you immediately have to include Camden, New Jersey in the conversation. Not so for 2017, though. Camden only recorded 23 killings, less than one third the number from just five years ago. Officials were cautious about celebrating that number, however, because the number of shootings actually rose. I don\u2019t know if that means they\u2019re just becoming really poor shots, are buying better body armor or what, but something odd is going on. For a city of just 75K people, that\u2019s still a lot of murders.\nI don\u2019t want to read too much into Baltimore\u2019s numbers at this stage. Things really calmed down at the end of 2017 and this year is starting off more slowly in terms of killings. I believe the citizens working in league with the local police are starting to make a difference.

It's part of who we are: what better reason than four hours of Patrick Chung tackles, Eli Manning passes, bad touchdown dances, and expensive advertising to bring us together, despite all of our diversity.\nAs if we needed it, Foursquare is giving us yet another reason to believe that the Super Bowl is a defacto national holiday: \"Super Swarm Sunday\" is the biggest check-in of the year.

An unsurprising, yet comforting, stat about the tradition behind the game.\nHowever, going against what beer commercials often depict as an all-male football culture, where women exist to ruin fun and turn off sports for mature conversations about feelings or chores, Foursquare's stats say that women were about half of all check-ins at Lucas Oil Stadium and accounted for 49 percent of Super Bowl-related check-ins total.\nWhat was most revealing, however, is what an international spectacle the Super Bowl has become. There were check-ins shouting \"Super Bowl\" in 117 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Macedonia \u2013 the top countries for check-ins included both Russia and Japan.\nThese statistics leave a few things to be discussed, like whether these large foreign numbers account for how dispersed Americans were yesterday or if they mean people overseas are as into it as we are, or for instance, how people are accessing the game, or what they mean in regards to the spread of American culture across the globe. Either way, it can be assumed that the Internet is the vehicle of global access, pulling people together in new ways every day.\nAmong the top 100 places worldwide for check-ins were Parque de Retiro in Madrid, Spain; Hooters in Naucalpan de Juarez, Mexico; Applebee's in Sau Paulo, Brazil; and McDonald's in Sandkan, Malaysia.\nProfessor Thom's bar in NYC was the most checked into sports bar in the country.\nFoursquare may have over ten million members, but the question remains whether it is a meaningful trend measuring stick.

A commission comprising senior government officials had been set up earlier in the administration to review the dam project and issue a report.\nDuring a visit to Kachin state in late December, Hong Liang, China\u2019s ambassador to Myanmar, told Kachin political leaders that his country is ready to move ahead with the hydropower dam on the Irrawaddy River.\nHe also said the Myitsone project was needed to generate electricity to implement China\u2019s One Belt, One Road infrastructure initiative in Myanmar, part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s U.S. $1 trillion global infrastructure-spending program.\nThe Kachin Democratic Party (KDP) cannot accept the dam project whether small or large because the Irrawaddy River is a vital water resource for the entire country, KDP chairman Gum Grawng Awng Hkam told RFA on Wednesday.\nEthnic Kachins do not accept the hydropower project because the river is a vital part of their history and heritage, while people in other parts of Myanmar consider it the property of the entire population, he said.\n\u201cAs we are Kachin residents, we know very well about rivers and tributaries in Kachin state,\u201d he told RFA\u2019s Myanmar Service. \u201cWe know which one is rough and wild, and which one is not.

Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group, which operates the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, announced this year big deals to buy both surgery centers and medical clinics.\nNonprofit hospitals say mergers are helping create coordinated health care systems that can more efficiently care for large groups of patients, but the deals also provide market power that could let health systems extract higher prices for their services.\nThe Star Tribune\u2019s Nonprofit 100 list for 2017 represents a swan song for the St. Paul-based HealthEast system (No. 10), as well as Grand Itasca Clinic and Hospital (No. 53), both of which are now part of Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services (No. 6).\nA large clinic system in Willmar is affiliating with St. Cloud-based CentraCare Health (No. 9), while North Memorial Health Care (No. 12) this year acquired one of the last independent primary care groups with multiple locations in the Twin Cities. Next year, a merger will add the town hospital in Hutchinson to the health system at Bloomington-based HealthPartners (No. 4).\nThe consolidation push is not unique to Minnesota.\nKaufman Hall, an Illinois-based consulting group, says the number of hospital and health system partnership transactions across the country this year exceeds last year\u2019s tally of 102 completed deals and is on track to be the busiest year ever. Whereas there were four mergers last year among organizations with $1 billion or more in revenue, Kaufman Hall says, eight transactions of that size including the Fairview-HealthEast deal had been announced by the end of September.\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Ascension and Providence St. Joseph Health systems are in talks to create a nonprofit that would be the largest hospital owner in the country, with $44.8 billion in annual revenue.

In fiscal 2017, the two groups collectively posted about $28 billion in revenue.\nAt the beginning of December, Advocate Health Care and Aurora Health Care announced merger plans to create the 10th largest integrated nonprofit health care system in the country.

Current CAR T trials at Seattle Children\u2019s take aim at leukemia and a variety of solid tumors, particularly brain cancers.\nSo far, clinical trials of the therapies have shown some stunning results, even curing a significant number of patients with advanced and aggressive cancer. For the moment, the therapies are being studied as last-ditch efforts for patients who have no other options.\nFamilies who happen to live close to research centers can often enroll their children in clinical trials like these to get the therapies, but for most families that is not an option.\nWhy would you share something that could fill all your hospital beds and make your hospital more profitable? The return on investment for this enterprise are more kids cured and kids cured with therapies that leave their bodies healthy and unharmed,.\nIn addition to Seattle Children\u2019s, the CureWorks collaboration includes Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C.; BC Children\u2019s Hospital in Vancouver, Canada; and Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. Patients who enroll in clinical trials through those hospitals will have T cells extracted at their home hospital and sent to SCRI manufacturing facilities in Seattle to be made into cancer-fighting CAR T cells.\nAfter being genetically re-engineered in SCRI\u2019s facility, the patient\u2019s cells will then be sent back to their member hospital, letting children around the country have access to potentially life-saving treatment.\nBut the program isn\u2019t just good for the patients: It\u2019s also good for the science. Jensen pointed out that children\u2019s hospitals often only have a few patients at a time with a particular kind of cancer, so getting enough data in a clinical trial can take much longer than it would in adult trials.\n\u201cWhat CureWorks can do is accelerate that through this collaboration and have many hospitals treating patients and generating that data,\u201d he said.\nOne of the main drivers of this project is a new, 30,000 square foot manufacturing center in Building Cure, a project still under construction that will soon house SCRI in downtown Seattle. The new construction is part of the $1 billion It Starts With Yes campaign, which Seattle Children\u2019s launched in September.\nJensen said the new facility is built differently than others of its kind. \u201cIt\u2019s a functionally closed system and allows us to manufacture more like a Henry Ford assembly line, rather than how a Lamborghini gets built by everyone coming to the one chassis and putting something on,\u201d he said.\nBecause most CAR T treatments have been developed for adults, whose immune systems differ from children\u2019s, Seattle Children\u2019s has put an emphasis on researching CAR T treatments specifically for kids and now has one of the largest pediatric immunotherapy research programs in the country."}

{"idx": "36398", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Too Much History: Can the U.S. and China Look Forward?\nHistory was interrupted on the morning of April 1, 2001, when an American EP-3E reconnaissance plane, carrying a crew of twenty-four, was flying over international waters about seventy miles off the Chinese coast. A Chinese jet approached; it collided with the American plane\u2019s propeller and crashed to the sea. The Chinese pilot was killed. The damaged American plane dropped eight thousand feet in thirty seconds before its pilot regained control and made an emergency landing on the tropical Chinese island of Hainan. The crewmembers made a brief, unsuccessful effort to disable the intelligence equipment before the EP-3E was boarded and they were placed under arrest.\nIn the thirteen years since then, the United States poured between four and six trillion dollars into prosecuting wars abroad while China, largely insulated from the conflicts of the day, more than quadrupled its military spending and advanced its claims to territories in the neighboring seas. For years, China maintained a low profile in foreign affairs, something Deng Xiaoping had ordained in his admonition to taoguang yanghui\u2014\u201cbide your time, and hide your strength.\u201d Douglas Paal, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote not long ago, \u201cYou may have missed the funeral, but China\u2019s new leadership has quietly buried\u201d that idea. The competition that was postponed in 2001 has never seemed closer at hand, and the U.S. faces a more complex challenge than simply curtailing the rise of a rival.\nSecretary of State John Kerry is in Beijing, to meet with senior Chinese officials and make a deceptively simple demand: halt a series of increasingly assertive steps in territorial disputes with its neighbors. The short-term goal is to reduce pressure on Japan and the Philippines, which have clashed with China over contested sections of the East China and South China Seas. But both sides recognize that the long-term goal\u2014to defuse an increasingly tense relationship between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries and remove the gathering cloud of a history that neither side can afford to repeat\u2014could hardly be more important.\nAt the same time, the United States has reasonably concluded that it cannot afford to ignore the pleas of its allies in Asia or allow an incremental drift toward a more volatile state of play. And so, the U.S. is left to perform a delicate balancing act. It must appeal to what Dyer calls \u201cglobalization China\u201d\u2014investment, trade, and engagement\u2014while attempting to police the ambitions of \u201cgreat power China.\u201d That is an ungainly diplomatic dance, but it is the one we\u2019ve arrived at.

The question of the day is whether IP infrastructure is a better mousetrap for video production when compared to a traditional SDI infrastructure.\nThe answer seems to be that IP is better for video infrastructure, with the catch being that not everything plays well together\u2014yet. Although there is a SMPTE standard for the transport of IP video (ST 2110) and this is excellent for interoperability, there is a bit of a learning curve and an adjustment period to get all the gear humming the way it should.\nThat said, there are many benefits to going the IP route for your in-house infrastructure and distribution. A big advantage is flexibility\u2014SDI is a point-to-point one-way system, and IP is bidirectional and can carry multiple uncompressed signals at the same time. A notable future advantage may be lower installation costs, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case today.\nSkaga said that the production staff does not see much difference in how operations are conducted, as their systems are much the same as before.\nThe TV2 Norway system relies significantly on Lawo production gear, and the bottom line for Skaga is how well the system runs.\nWhen building an IP-based system, Skaga recommends putting a lot of effort into designing the network infrastructure. Getting this right from the start will save you from a lot of trouble, he said, but don\u2019t be surprised if you still have work to do.\nThe production control room at Celebro includes a Behringer digital audio mixer and NewTek TriCaster TC1 live production switcher.\nCelebro Media, a Washington-based studio facility that caters to international broadcasters, recently built a new studio facility using IP technology. At the heart of it is a NewTek production switcher connected throughout the facility using NewTek\u2019s Network Device Interface technology, an IP-based solution that NewTek has shared with many other companies.\nGaisford pointed out that the NewTek production switcher has only four SDI inputs, and he has four studio cameras plus a host of other inputs\u2014including international remote feeds.\nCelebro\u2019s system was not quite plug-and-play, and Gaisford echoed a thought that many television engineers share.\nThe engineering staff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons, recently installed an IP-based video system from Ross Video that is used on game day to source and distribute signals used for broadcasts and in-park video.\nOne of the decisions was what speed to make the IP network.\nTo promote the second season of its syndicated daytime programming, Daily Blast Live (DBL), broadcast station group TEGNA conducted a live, point-to-point \u201cmedia tour\u201d from its KUSA Denver studio to 32 stations across the country. For six straight hours on one day, Daily Blast Live sent 32 different live shots about every 10 minutes featuring DBL talent to TEGNA morning and noon shows.\nStation group TEGNA turned to TVU Grid, an IP-based switching, routing and distribution system from TVU Networks, to receive DBL media tour audio and video.\nThe number of shots, the total length of time, and the varying time zones that had to be accommodated made purchasing satellite time too cost-prohibitive, so TEGNA turned to TVU Grid, an IP-based switching, routing and distribution system from TVU Networks, to receive DBL media tour audio and video.\nEach local TEG"}

He was released from Bossier Parish Medium Security Prison Thursday (April 12) after changes to state law reduced the penalties for marijuana possession and the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office agreed to reduce his 13-year sentence.\nMr. Noble had become a national emblem of overly harsh and ineffective drug laws and the excessive sentences allowed under Louisiana's habitual offender statute. His 13-year sentence stemmed from earlier convictions for possession of small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, according to the Marshall Project.\nBut even with Mr. Noble as a fresh example of the excessively punitive nature of Louisiana's habitual offender law, the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee rejected a bill Tuesday to remove nonviolent offenses from the calculation for enhanced sentences.\nRep. Chad Brown, a Democrat from Plaquemine, said his House Bill 355 is meant to reduce disproportionate sentences for people with low-level, nonviolent offenses.\nSarah Omojola, policy counsel for the Southern Poverty Law Center, pointed out that offenders like Mr. Noble could benefit more from substance abuse programs and other counseling. \"HB 355 would exclude nonviolent offenses from habitual offender sentencing enhancements. The money saved from these unnecessarily harsh sentences could then be reinvested into rehabilitative alternatives - such as substance abuse counseling and mental health treatment - that would address some of the root causes of crime and create a safer Louisiana,\" she said in a written statement after the committee vote.\nTo its credit, the state Legislature made sweeping changes to sentencing laws last spring at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards, the Justice Reinvestment Task Force and business and civic leaders. That criminal justice legislation lessened the harshness of the habitual offender statute, although the changes weren't retroactive.\nSince Nov. 1, new convictions for drug and nonviolent offenses will not trigger a life sentence for a defendant with prior convictions. Mandatory minimum sentences will be shorter for habitual offenders. And the length of time that a prior felony conviction could be used to enhance penalties on a new offense has been shortened from 10 years to five.\nThe task force also recommended the removal of nonviolent offenses from the habitual offender sentencing calculation, but that didn't pass. HB 355 would have remedied that omission.\nThere were strong arguments presented to the committee Tuesday. According to tweets by Louisianans for Prison Alternatives, New Orleans public defender Sarah O'Brien said there are \"hundreds more like Corey Ladd and Bernard Noble who are sitting in Louisiana prisons for years for low-level offenses.\"\nMr. Ladd testified Tuesday. \"Corey Ladd addressing the Administration of Criminal Justice Committee.

The big question: Does Limelight have enough headroom to gain meaningful share from Akamai?\nJason Perlow detailed how content delivery network provider Limelight was pivotal to the success of NBCOlympics.com. The punch line: NBC's sea of video didn't melt under demand because Limelight helped deliver the content without technically dealing with the Internet.\nBack in late July of this year, NBC finally announced that Limelight would be the primary supplier of content caching services for the Olympics. Where Limelight differs from Akamai and why the Internet didn\u2019t \u201cmelt\u201d is quite simple \u2014 they are completely \u201coff the cloud\u201d. In other words, unlike Akamai and similar content caching providers, their system isn\u2019t deployed over the public Internet.\n$15.3 million, or 18 cents a share: Limelight Networks' second quarter loss. Excluding charges, Limelight reported a loss of 2 cents a share. The biggest one-time item was a set aside for potential damages in a litigation suit.\nIn June 2006, Akamai Technologies, Inc., or Akamai, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that the Company was infringing two patents assigned to MIT and exclusively licensed by MIT to Akamai, U.S. Patent No. 6,553,413 (the 413 patent) and U.S. Patent No. 6,108,703 (the 703 patent). In September 2006, Akamai and MIT expanded their claims to assert infringement of a third, recently issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,103,645 (the 645 patent). In February 2008, a jury returned a verdict in this lawsuit, finding that the Company infringed four claims of the \u2018703 patent at issue and rejecting the Company\u2019s invalidity defenses for the period April 2005 through December 31, 2007. The jury awarded an aggregate of approximately $45.5 million which includes lost profits, reasonable royalties and price erosion damages. In addition the jury awarded pre-judgment interest which the Company estimates to be $2.6 million at December 31, 2007. The Company has recorded the aggregate $48.1 million as a provision for litigation as of December 31, 2007. A key determinant in our ability to estimate possible future charges is the extent to which we are able to determine a correlation between the jury awarded amount to the various elements of the allegations.

We've actually preserved a lot of the cash we raised in the last round.\"\nInstead, the investment and partnership reflect the strategic value of a relationship with America Movil and Slim. Although the service is available worldwide -- the app is available for both smartphones and feature phones -- the company has recently focused on North America and Western Europe. Initiatives in advertising and TV have helped double its user base to 325 million since its previous funding round in June 2011.\nAmerica Movil is the largest component of the conglomeration built by Slim, Forbes' richest man in the world for the last four years. The company has operations throughout Latin America that cover fixed and mobile telephony, broadband and fixed-line Internet services, and digital television. Slim's investments also include mining, real estate and professional soccer teams.\n\"Carlos Slim is much broader than America Movil in terms of the portfolios of operations they have in the territory,\" Fisher says.\nThe partnership will help expand Shazam's user base -- the app will be pre-loaded on mobile devices in Latin America -- but will also provide opportunities to change the way people in the territory access information over the Internet.\n\"As we got into that conversation about Latin America and partnering with America Movil,\" Fisher says, \"we also saw opportunity in the emerging category of media engagement,\" the way people access content through music, television and advertisements.\nA larger Shazam that better engages consumers will have an impact on the music industry. The audio recognition tool is a popular way to discover and buy songs. The company says it is responsible for more than $300 million in purchases a year through affiliate partners such as iTunes, and that figure is almost doubling every year. Fisher says more than 500,000 tracks are sold through Shazam every day, or about 10 percent of the global value of digital sales value in 2012, and the daily rate is almost doubling annually.\n\"People will buy at the point of inspiration if you make it really easy for them,\" Fisher says.\nThe America Movil funding could provide the company with momentum toward an initial public stock offering -- although there's no hurry. Fisher says Shazam still has plenty of cash from its last funding. That gives it the flexibility to make acquisitions and grow as a private company rather than a public one.\nShazam is already headed in that direction. Brent Hoberman, co-founder of British travel and gift business Lastminute.com, became a non-executive director in December and is helping navigate the company to an initial public stock offering.

She\u2019s a real rugby fan, and if she were 30 years younger, she\u2019d have had her eye, you suspect, on that young David Denton (the man of the match, if you missed it, and a back row forward of immense stature and equally impressive looks).\nHowever, without full hazchem uniform and headgear, I wouldn\u2019t have liked to be anywhere near the Princess Royal if she were called on to deliver her post-match verdict. Quite how Scotland contrived to lose to England is a mystery that makes Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem look like the Daily Star quick crossword. They should have slotted 20 points past England, and the fact that their permanently ballistic coach Andy Robinson has not yet spontaneously combusted can only be explained by the cold weather.\nIs the problem that the Scots team has become too urban, representing just Edinburgh and Glasgow?

Picamoles is an outstanding addition to the French (you need to be to replace Harinordoquy), alongside Bonnaire and Dusautoir; while in green Ferris, O\u2019Brien and Heaslip are a match for anybody.

That's because last year most of Poland's 4 million individual peasant farmers had to make do without any new boots at all. The few boots that were available went to workers on the big state farms, although they account for only 20 percent of the farm population.\nThough farmers may be cheered by the prospect of having the appropriate footgear, they are nonetheless skeptical about many features in the agricultural program the government recently introduced.\n* At least a 20 percent increase in production of farm equipment - from small hand tools to heavy machinery - including delivery of at least 175,000 tractors by 1985.\n* Larger appropriations for agriculture and the related food-farming industries. This sector may receive as much as one-third of Poland's total investment outlay over the next three years.\n* A new system of prices and taxes to guarantee private farmers stable conditions and profitability.\n* Expansion of rural amenities and services to reduce the gap in living standards between town and country and, it is hoped, stem the drift of young people from the land.\nThe goal of self-sufficiency in food by 1985 is a big order. Between 1970 and 1980 Poland's grain imports increased fourfold, totaling more than 9 million tons. The crisis that erupted in August 1980 put an end to such extravagant imports.\nThe peasants are uneasy about the tax proposal. Economists insist that taxing private farmers as well as the big state farms is necessary to combat inflation, which may exceed 30 percent this year, and to absorb the millions of unspent zlotys in the pockets of private farmers.\nHalf of the grain imports of the 1970s, said Minister of Agriculture Stanislaw Zieba, were the direct consequence of unfulfilled promises by successive governments to provide adequate industrial production for agricultural needs. But uncertainties about the private sector's profitability drove many people from the land, thus reducing agricultural manpower.\nThe peasants were recently given an assurance that a parliamentary committee will soon draft a constitutional amendment to guarantee private land ownership. Rural Solidarity - the farmers' union - had demanded guarantees of tenure, and its demands were recognized in legislation a year ago. But the peasants want them written into the Constitution as protection against any future extension of the state sector.\nOne of the most formidable obstacles to the production of more food may well be the peasants' skepticism about the government's sincerity regarding the new policy. They have heard promises about modernization before - and pledges that they would receive all the fertilizer and machinery they need.\nYet an ideological bias against the private sector has persisted when it comes time to distribute such materials and equipment.\nUnder the strains of martial-law rationing, the Communist Party press has frequently accused individual farmers of being unpatriotic, of hoarding and speculation to force higher farm prices, and of refusing to turn more of their production over to the lean and meager state market.\nMost of the charges were unfair. Polityka - the weekly magazine that was recently under fire from Moscow because of its often independent line - has said that the blame lies with the authorities' failure to provide farmers with adequate supplies of such basic tools as spades, let alone the equipment needed to modernize a sector where horse-drawn plows are still common.\nThis failure was graphically illustrated recently when the newspaper Rzeczpospolita answered"}

And it now seems that even Sao Paolo, Brazil\u2019s burgeoning city, will soon go down the same path unless the rain gods decide to favour them.\nSpeaking of cities, how does our very own Bengaluru cope with water challenges? The IT hub draws heavily from the Cauvery river, with more than 50% of the water that is reserved for domestic use in Karnataka diverted to fulfill the city\u2019s needs. This water pumped from a distance of 100km and lifted up to a height of 540m by the BWSSB caters to 11 million people. Till 1896, unfiltered water was supplied to Bengaluru via multiple tanks within the city. In 1884, the river Arkavathi was identified as a resource and a reservoir was built near Hessarghatta. As water demands increased, a new reservoir was built at Chamraj Nagar. When the supply of water from Arkavathy fell short, the Cauvery River was identified as a resource. Expansion of the city and rise in population gave birth to Cauvery Stage I, II, III and IV projects.\nClimate change made rainfalls an unreliable source of water. Thus citizens started banking upon underground water. The district irrigation plan of Bengaluru urban district shows that the net annual groundwater available is 11,723 hectare metres and actual groundwater consumption is 16,703 hectare metres. The stage of groundwater extraction in Bengaluru ranges from 128%-176%, varying as per taluk. This over-exploitation of groundwater is compounded with contamination. Reports by the Central Ground Water Board and Ground Water Directorate, Karnataka indicate that harmful chemicals such as nitrate, fluoride, arsenic are present beyond permissible limits in Bengaluru. The plummeting groundwater level and contamination can be attributed to concretization of the city. Lack of open spaces and wetlands in the city limit the ability of water to percolate into the ground.\nThe question arises: To what extent do we use our natural water bodies? Bengaluru\u2019s lakes remain unutilized at best and polluted at worst. Bengaluru\u2019s founder Kempegowda, keeping the in mind the city\u2019s undulating terrain of slopes, made utmost use of the terrain by building lakes to support domestic and agricultural needs of the city. In 1962, there were 262 lakes in Bengaluru. Today, only 81 remain; golf courses, residential colonies, playgrounds and bus stands now occupy the space that once held lakes. The quality of water within the lakes has also degraded. A study by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board tested the quality of water in the lakes in November 2017.

I maintain a good health and have healthy eating habits. My weight is under control, am not suffering from any disease and I go for a morning walk daily and do mild indoor exercises for half an hour. My meals are as follows: bread along with a single egg omlette everyday, black tea twice daily, lunch is moderate and some times I take a bakery product for dinner. Three months back I noticed blood coming out along with stools. I consulted a doctor and he prescribed an antibiotic for five days and an aurvedic cream for internal application. The doctor diagnosed my symptoms as piles. I was advised to change my food habits. I take moderate food thrice in a day, which includes fresh fruits regularly after lunch and dinner and I drink 6-8 glasses of water. I do not understand the cause for the problem. I have avoided bread completely and have started taking porridge made of white oats for breakfast and lunch/dinner is devoid of spicy curries. The problem relapsed after three weeks inspite of the above care. On cosultation the doctor advised to repeat the same antibiotic and cream after which the problem disapperead. I am on a normal diet now i.e. with normal range of chillies in the curries etc. I am continuing with white oats break fast and haven't reduced the fresh fruits with lunch and dinner. But the abdominal gas and consipation persist. Kindly advise.\nA:Please drink not less than 12-14 glasses of water daily as your problem is persistent, over and above that you can take tea/coffee. Preferably try to avoid coffee and the daily tea intake should also not exceed 2 cups. Always combine your breakfast with a bowl of fruits. If you feel acidity, take any one fruit in larger quantities. As far as fruit/salad intake is concerned, I will prefer that you always combine intake of these with a cereal like some puffed rice or atleast 2 biscuits. In other case, you may steam your salads and stew your fruits with cinnamon powder (1/2 pinch), sugar and water to avoid gas and acidity. Also start daily intake of 1 teaspoon of husk/Isabgol with 1/2 cup milk diluted and taken at night before sleep. Increase or decrease your dose according to how your body reacts."}

Anti-discrimination laws that support the equal rights of employees are regulated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Additional employment laws are controlled by the U.S. Department of Labor, and various other federal and local agencies designed to protect employee privileges.\nEmployers are required to comply with fair labor standards as they relate to employment laws and rules. The U.S. Department of Labor established the Fair Labor Standards Act to set \u201cminimum wage, overtime pay, record-keeping and youth employment standards affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector.\u201d What this means for small businesses is that they are responsible for operating their company in compliance with the laws of the act. Small business owners must keep appropriate records regarding their employee\u2019s time and wages as well as ensure all employees are paid accurately and on time.\nEqual Employment Opportunity refers to discrimination in the workplace. Small businesses are prohibited from the discrimination and unfair treatment of employees in regards to race, gender, religion, national origin or other protected classifications as stated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Employers are also prohibited from harassing employees or denying reasonable accommodations for a mental or physical disability. Employees have the right to file a complaint if they feel they have been unfairly discriminated against by their employer.\nEmployees have the right to receive equal pay and benefits for the work they perform. Federal law requires small business owners to pay employees a required minimum wage or a specified minimum for employees that receive tips. Also, fringe benefits offered to one employee must be offered to all other employees. Employers that allow employees to work overtime must pay their employees a premium for the amount of time they work in excess of 40 hours in a work week.\nSmall business owners must meet certain workplace standards that support a healthy and positive work environment for their employees. Employers must provide equal working quarters for all employees that perform the same or similar job duties. Special accommodations should not be provided for one employee over another unless the privileged employee has a mental of physical limitation that requires special attention. Employers are also responsible for ensuring the office environment is free from workplace hazards that could cause harm or danger to their employees.\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing anti-discrimination laws and investigating complaints brought on by employees. The U.S. Department of Labor establishes laws and regulates the compliance of fair labor standards regarding accurate pay, record-keeping, youth labor and overtime.

So Montgomery and Stump, 36, weren\u2019t allowed back in until later in the week.\nFirefighters brought out some things for them \u2014 a laptop and baby clothes, for example \u2014 as they mopped up the fire. Stump, Montgomery and their kids, Eloise and Dominic, 10, stayed the night with family in Sumas. Since then the local chapter of the American Red Cross has helped them to find more permanent housing.\nOn Thursday afternoon Stump was told he could go back in to collect some things. Montgomery needed to wait outside in the car with her kids.\nStump found a sliding glass door open on the back side of the house. A big ashy footprint had been left near one of the windows. Missing were a baby stroller, three computers custom-built by Stump, a 40-inch Samsung flat-screen TV, an LCD monitor in their 10-year-old son\u2019s room, and a file server full of family photos.\nTwo monitors were left behind.

Dubai's long-awaited landmark, Mall of the Emirates, the largest shopping mall outside North America, opens for business today.\nThe new centre - with a total size equivalent to 73 football pitches - will be home to over 400 retailers, 65 restaurants, a huge indoor ski slope called Ski Dubai, a 14-screen Cinestar cinema, Magic Planet, which will be the largest indoor family entertainment centre in Dubai, the new Dubai Community Theatre and Arts Centre, and a five-star Kempinski Hotel.\nThe mall, which is situated off Shaikh Zayed Road, is owned by Majid Al Futtaim Investments (MAF) and has been built in just under two years at a cost of AED3 billion. It will be the fourth mall, including the Deira City Centre, owned by MAF in the UAE and the seventh in the region.\nFrancois de Montaudouin, CEO of MAF, commented to local reporters yesterday: \"The mall is located in what we call the 'New Dubai'. Today we have the largest mall outside North America. It will be different because it will cater for every age group and social class.\"\nAt the heart of \u2018New Dubai\u2019 to the West of the old centre the mall will cater to, amongst other districts, the rapidly growing residential centres like The Hills, Barsha, Jumeirah Lake Towers and Jumeirah Islands.\nThe official opening of the mall will not take place until it is completely finished, which is scheduled to be April 2006 and will be the fruits of the labour of around 10,000 workmen.\n\"It is going to work in phases. We are now going to open about 70% of the space. During October every week more stores will open with the idea that by the end of Ramadan all the stores will be open. The last piece will be in April with a theatre and arts centre,\" de Montaudouin added.\nThough parts of the area surrounding the mall still resemble a building site, the inside presents a different picture, with many stores ready to open their doors to the public. The architecture in the three-storey complex combines Arabic and Mediterranean influences, with each level linked to a car park.\nAmong the many interesting retailer initiatives that will open to the public today, Jumbo Electronics will have its largest-ever consumer electronics store. At 100,000 square feet, the store layout has been conceptualised keeping in mind McKinsey & Company's recommendations on retailing.\nThis is Jumbo's 27th store in the UAE, and it will house 50 major brands including Sony, Nokia, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Acer, Casio, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson.\nAnother Dubai-based company, the Landmark Group has united its five leading retail concepts - Babyshop, Shoe Mart, Splash, Home Centre and Lifestyle - into a single destination-store for the Mall of the Emirates. Called Centrepoint, the new store will be the largest non-food store in the mall and at 140,400 square feet, the equivalent of 66 tennis courts, it will occupy 7% of the mall\u2019s total floor space.\nCentrepoint features a completely new brand identity, upgraded store design and shop fit outs and value-added customer service elements.

When I reminded Rzeznik of our conversation last week in what amounted to a 25-years-later follow-up interview, it sparked some intriguing insight into his background.\n\u201cI think when we started working on [1993\u2019s] \u2018Superstar Car Wash\u2019 was probably when I started to use my last name,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I was like, you know what, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019m doing, I want people to know my last name. I\u2019m proud of where I came from. I\u2019m proud of being from Buffalo, and I\u2019m proud of being Polish, you know?\nBut somewhere along the line, somebody in the music business decided that the Goo Goo Dolls were good. Next thing Rzeznik and his bandmates knew, they were going out to Los Angeles and playing showcases, then recording albums for a major independent label, then touring the country for months on end.\nSo where\u2019s the party, dude?\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s work now,\u201d Rzeznik deadpanned.\nHe\u2019s quick to add, though, that work doesn\u2019t have to be a drag. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad job; it ain\u2019t a bad job at all,\u201d he says. And while the Goo Goo Dolls are learning to take their job more seriously these days, a quick listen to the trio\u2019s latest album \u201cHold Me Up\u201d is all one needs to be convinced that they\u2019re still not taking themselves too seriously.\nAfter all, any rock band that brings in a hometown R&B lounge singer named The Incredible Lance Diamond to sing on a cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cNever Take the Place of Your Man\u201d obviously still has a sense of humor.\nYet while Rzeznik seems determined to keep a low-key attitude, the memorable songs and triumphantly brash sound of \u201cHold Me Up\u201d suggest that the Goo Goo Dolls have the musical muscle it takes to hit the big time.\nThat versatility carries over to lyrical perspectives as well.

A camera performance unseen on a smartphone.\nApart from the 10X optical zoom, you get optical image stabilisation, xenon flash and a 24mm wide-angle lens.\nNEW DELHI: While most smartphone manufacturers are trying to improve the cameras on their smartphone (improved low light capabilities. image stabilisation and so on), Samsung has gone ahead and successfully combined a 10x optical zoom point and shoot camera with a powerful Android smartphone and called it the Galaxy S4 Zoom.\nOne can easily mistake the S4 zoom for a point and shoot camera at first glance. The camera module has a lens ring around it. There\u2019s also a xenon flash and AF light on the side along with a hump that acts as the camera grip \u2014 resembling most point and shoot cameras. The lens ring can be used to zoom in or out in camera mode. When not in camera mode, rotating the lens ring displays a quick launcher with shortcuts to various camera modes \u2014 auto, beauty, macro, night, landscape or gallery.\nOn one side is the power and volume button, while on the other is microSD slot and the camera shutter button. Samsung even managed to put in an IR blaster to use the phone as a remote control for various devices. The S4 Zoom has a 16MP 1/2.33\u201d CMOS sensor \u2014 the same size sensor is also used in many point and shoot cameras.\nApart from the 10X optical zoom, you get optical image stabilisation, xenon flash and a 24mm wide-angle lens. Combined, this delivers camera performance unseen on a smartphone. Image quality is fantastic \u2014 rich colour, sharp details and minimal noise. Video recording in full HD is also great and if you record at 720p resolution, you can record at a remarkable 60fps. The camera interface is similar to the one found on the Galaxy camera and Galaxy S4. The S4 zoom also offer manuals exposure control which is impressive. You can adjust shutter speed, aperture, exposure, ISO, sharpness, metering, drive and so on.\nWe would have loved it if images could also be saved in RAW. If you have the S4 zoom, there is no need to carry a separate point and shoot. The 4.3-inch super amoled display has good viewing angles, but the 960 x 540 pixels resolution is a letdown. We would have preferred a 1280 x 720 pixel display at this price.\nAnother issue we have with the device is its weight. At over 200 grams and a protruding lens + grip, it\u2019s not easy to carry in your pocket all the time. General day-to-day smartphone performance is great. The dual core processor with 1.5GB RAM proves to be enough for gaming, HD video files and multitasking. In the image gallery, we noticed that the device takes time to load images only after there are over 100 images in full resolution saved on internal storage.\nThe battery lasts almost a full day with continuous data connectivity, voice calls and extensive use of camera with its 2330mah battery. With extensive use of xenon flash, the battery life drops considerably. The Galaxy S4 zoom is highly recommended for those who want a hybrid device offering the best of smartphone and a camera.\nAlthough there is nothing in the same price that comes close to"}

He was fifty-seven years old, and he suffered from severe migraines that felt as if a drill were working behind his eyes, across his forehead, and down the back of his head and neck. They left him nauseated, causing him to vomit every half hour for up to eighteen hours. He\u2019d spend a day and a half in bed, and then another day stumbling through sentences. The pain would gradually subside, but often not entirely. And after a few days a new attack would begin.\nHaynes (I\u2019ve changed his name, at his request) had his first migraine at the age of nineteen. It came on suddenly, while he was driving. He pulled over, opened the door, and threw up in someone\u2019s yard. At first, the attacks were infrequent and lasted only a few hours. But by the time he was thirty, married, and working in construction management in London, where his family was from, they were coming weekly, usually on the weekends. A few years later, he began to get the attacks at work as well.\nHe saw all kinds of doctors\u2014primary-care physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists\u2014who told him what he already knew: he had chronic migraine headaches. And what little the doctors had to offer didn\u2019t do him much good. Headaches rank among the most common reasons for doctor visits worldwide. A small number are due to secondary causes, such as a brain tumor, cerebral aneurysm, head injury, or infection. Most are tension headaches\u2014diffuse, muscle-related head pain with a tightening, non-pulsating quality\u2014that generally respond to analgesics, sleep, neck exercises, and time. Migraines afflict about ten per cent of people with headaches, but a much larger percentage of those who see doctors, because migraines are difficult to control.\nMigraines are typically characterized by severe, disabling, recurrent attacks of pain confined to one side of the head, pulsating in quality and aggravated by routine physical activities. They can last for hours or days. Nausea and sensitivity to light or sound are common. They can be associated with an aura\u2014visual distortions, sensory changes, or even speech and language disturbances that herald the onset of head pain.\nAlthough the cause of migraines remains unknown, a number of treatments have been discovered that can either reduce their occurrence or alleviate them once they occur. Haynes tried them all. His wife also took him to a dentist who fitted him with a mouth guard. After seeing an advertisement, she got him an electrical device that he applied to his face for half an hour every day. She bought him hypnotism tapes, high-dosage vitamins, magnesium tablets, and herbal treatments. He tried everything enthusiastically, and occasionally a remedy would help for a brief period, but nothing made a lasting difference.\nFinally, desperate for a change, he and his wife quit their jobs, rented out their house in London, and moved to a cottage in a rural village. The attacks eased for a few months. A local doctor who had migraines himself suggested that Haynes try the cocktail of medicines he used. That helped some, but the attacks continued. Haynes seesawed between good periods and bad. And without work he and his wife began to feel that they were vegetating.\nOn a trip to New York"}
{"idx": "36457", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The website France 24 carries a story about a survey of French Muslim attitudes which suggests that up to a third of France\u2019s four to five million Muslims reject the legitimacy of the country\u2019s secular laws. This makes for interesting reading, but perhaps not quite in the manner you might expect.\nFirst of all, this poll was done over the telephone and the sample was a small one, so it is highly doubtful that this survey is anything more than the most cursory of opinion polls. In other words, the answers it comes up with are doubtful \u2013 but the questions it makes us pose may be useful.\nSecondly, this poll might well be taken as a guide to what people really think about the burkini and the hijab; but that is not a very interesting matter. After all, we know that lots of people must approve of the hijab, as lots of women in France wear it; and given the volume of burkini sales, someone out there must be quite keen on this rather cumbersome garment. But in the end, is dress so important?\nFar more important than the practicalities of what to wear are the underlying social and religious attitudes that lead people to dress the way they do. And what makes that interesting is the way social and religious questions interact.\nFor example, if I were a French Catholic, how would I see the laws of the French Republic? I would see them as subordinate to the law of God, naturally, and where they contradicted the law of God, I would refuse to obey them. Thus, as a Catholic, I would reject the law on abortion, and I would do all I could to get it changed, via engagement in the democratic process. But other laws, which were either good, or neutral, I would obey, because I would see in the French parliament the embodiment of the democratic will of the French people.\nDemocracy is a good system, and we should be committed to the search for consensus; as Catholics we should utterly reject all attempt to delegitimise, either in theory or in practice, the state, which exists, not through divine right, but through Divine Providence, and is there to promote the common good.\nWhat this poll suggests is that there is a body of Muslims in France who would not agree with the position that I have outlined above. They may well obey the laws and live quiet and peaceful lives, but in theory they do not recognise the authority of the state, because they do not believe in democracy or the settlement of questions through the search for consensus. This means, at bottom, that they reject the role of human reason in problem solving, and ascribe to what is often called \u201cDivine Command Theory\u201d: something is right because God wills it, not because it is good in itself and as such discoverable by human reason.\nA special note to Catholics: Divine Command Theory, while once held by certain medieval theologians, back in the day, is now regarded by Catholic theologians as utterly mistaken, for it leads to the nonsense of believing that God could command things that are inherently unjust. But this Divine Command Theory is alive and well in Islam, and justifies quite a few things that are utterly wrong, such as polygamy, slavery and the death penalty for sorcery. These are, at least, condoned by the Koran, therefore they must be OK.\nAs for the question of the role of reason in theology, let us remember two people who have pointed to this matter insistently in recent decades. The first was Saint John Paul II in his letter Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason) and the second was Benedict XVI in his Regensburg Address. These are two texts we need to return to"}

A beta will be released sometime this summer, they said.\nPaul Flessner, the senior vice president of Microsofts server platform division, told eWEEK in an interview here that Yukon is a big release for Microsoft and that it will take a year to do the necessary quality assurance.\nYukon also involves tight integration around the next version of Visual Studio .Net, code-named Whitby, and the Visual Studio team also felt they needed more time. \"Quality is number one for us, and if its not ready at the end of 2004 well ship it when it is ready,\" he said.\nMicrosoft is not concerned about the delay as SQL Server 2000 still has \"great legs\" in the market and Microsoft is adding value to it through things like Reporting Services. \"Its still a very competitive product in the market,\" Flessner said.\nStan Sorensen, the director of SQL Server Product Management, also told eWEEK here at the TechEd conference that the product delay is essentially about quality. \"The feedback that we have got from customers is that they expect a rock solid release.\"\nMicrosoft wants to exceed customer expectations with Yukon, and the best way to do that is \"to give the product plenty of time to cook as well as give Microsoft plenty of time to get up and running and put it into production,\" he said.\nAlso, among the many release criteria for Yukon, Microsoft wants the database deployed in full production within the company as well as in production on real systems within customer sites as well.\n\"The best way to do that is to ensure that customers have plenty of time to actually get that work done.

TC wants to enjoy war profiteering and global power. Paul would abolish the federal income tax while the TC wants to pile on a global tax payable to the UN.\nThe formal agenda was loaded with everything Paul and American patriots detest: higher taxes, more foreign giveaways, more immigration, both legal and illegal, into the United States and \u201cengaging Iran,\u201d among others.\nAMERICA NEEDS TO PAY HER FAIR SHARE?\nIt was presided over by journalistic pimp David Gergen, who will write nothing about TC in his magazine, U.S News and World Report.

If they cannot agree, the government would shut down at midnight Friday for the first time since 2013.\nHouse Republican leaders are scheduled to discuss their plans for a stopgap spending measure with rank-and-file lawmakers Tuesday evening.\nHopes of a deal to keep the government open have been complicated by lingering mistrust following an Oval Office meeting last week in which, according to several people familiar with the gathering, President Trump used vulgar terms to describe poor countries sending immigrants to the United States.\nThe meeting was to consider a bipartisan immigration deal to protect the \"dreamers\" \u2014 young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, including the 690,000 currently enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Trump has canceled. Democratic leaders are demanding that protections for the dreamers be part of any spending deal. They have the leverage to do so because Senate Republicans would need at least nine Democratic votes to support any funding measure. Democrats also want Republicans to match military spending that Trump and many GOP lawmakers are seeking with an equal increase in nondefense funding.\n\"If they need Democratic votes, the overall legislation needs to meet certain Democratic criteria and be reflective of the values of the Democratic caucus and what we believe are the values of the American people,\" Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in an interview.\nThere is also no guarantee that House GOP leaders will be able to rally a majority of their members to support a short-term spending measure, which multiple congressional aides and a senior Trump administration official said would probably last through mid-February.\nDefense hawks, in particular, are livid at further delaying a planned boost in military funding. That could mean House Republicans would also need Democratic votes to pass a short-term deal \u2014 something the minority party may not be inclined to provide this time around.\nOne option Republicans are strongly considering to win over Democrats, according to two aides familiar with the GOP's planning, is attaching a long-term renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program to the stopgap. Republicans believe that many Democrats \u2014 especially senators seeking reelection this year \u2014 will have a tough time voting against the program, which they have called a top priority.\nOn Capitol Hill, however, there are hopes that tensions will ease as the shutdown deadline approaches.

If it does, pressure may increase in the European Union to approve drugs designed to reduce weight, including compounds developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARNA), Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS), and Orexigen (NASDAQ:OREX).\nObesity is a major cause of diabetes (almost 90% of diabetics are overweight) and increasingly thicker waistlines have industry watchers predicting that the number of people with diabetes will soar from 366 million to 552 million globally by 2030 and that the number of people living with the disease in Europe will climb from less than 53 million people to more than 64 million people. That significant increase is expected to spike health-care spending on diabetes, which totaled a combined $120 billion in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. in 2012.\nThat expected spending surge has the drug industry investing billions to develop new diabetes treatments, but it's not just the industry giants that are developing therapies that may have a profound impact on the disease. Small companies like Arena, Vivus, and Orexigen have developed drugs that may help prevent diabetes by controlling patient weight.\nThe FDA has already approved two new weight-loss drugs, one from Arena Pharmaceuticals and another from Vivus, but neither has been a hit (yet).\nSales of Arena and marketing partner Eisai's Belviq, totaled just $3 million in the first quarter; however, Eisai recently reported that it's bulking up its U.S. sales force by 50%. That increases the number of people calling on doctors to about 600.\nVivus hasn't done much better with its Qsymia. Qysmia won FDA approval in 2012, but its sales totaled just $9 million in the first quarter.\nLast year, Arena withdrew its application for Belviq's approval in the European Union after it recognized that it wouldn't be able to address a key advisory panel's questions prior to the panel making a recommendation. Those questions surround Arena's potential side effects and risks, including tumors found in rats treated with the drug during trials.\nVivus' case for Qsymia has similarly hit roadblocks in Europe. EU regulators rejected Vivus' application and the appeal that followed based on worries that long-term use of Qysmia could result in cardiovascular and central nervous system disease. Vivus has since asked EU regulators whether interim analysis from an ongoing long-term use study could be used as part of a resubmission, and the company appears to be advancing in that direction; but no timing has been offered up as to when such a resubmission may happen.\nAlthough both Arena and Vivus have stalled in Europe, Orexigen may still have a shot at approval there.

You spend months and thousands of ringgit to come up with brand ideas, produce billboards and newspaper ads, make videos that will be skipped after five seconds on YouTube - only to have all of that work undone by one Facebook post from some guy who mistook wagyu beef for pork.\nEven when brands are not going out of their way to market non-halal imagery, the case of Malaysia Airlines' Going Places magazine - which came under fire last week when social media users thought that a beef dish in one of its pages was pork - is an example of how hyper-sensitive Malaysians can be when it comes to this subject.\nSo that raises an interesting question that I want to explore today.\nBrands have always planned their Chinese New Year marketing campaigns based on the animal zodiac sign of the year. But how do you market an animal that is reviled by some communities?\nLet's see how China handled it. The last Year of the Pig was in 2007, and China's national broadcaster CCTV (now CGTN) banned advertisements that featured pigs \"to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities.\"\nIn China, Muslims make up only 2% of its population.\nPreserving the sensitivities of ethnic minorities was lauded, but that move also presented a challenge for retailers to draw in traditional customers, because it was like running a Christmas campaign with \"no images of Father Christmas,\" according to an article by NPR.\nIt feels like a Catch-22. You can't change the zodiac sign but if you make pigs the mainstay of your marketing campaign, you risk incurring the wrath of offended customers.\nHowever, if you totally ignore the zodiac sign, you may alienate the Chinese market, which values culture and tradition, and are the ones celebrating and spending the most this holiday season.\nThough the government has said businesses were free to use any imagery of pigs in their marketing campaigns, the approach by Malaysian brands in their advertising for this year's CNY has been as varying as it has been interesting.\nSome are playing it safe, opting for other themed CNY marketing campaigns; such as Maxis which is running a hilarious ad campaign focusing on family competition. Sunway Group is highlighting Hakka culture, of which a large percentage of Malaysian Chinese can claim roots, in its Sunway Pyramid mall.\nPerodua has a single beige advertisement with tiny CNY symbols such as lanterns, firecrackers and lions to promote rebates for its cars.\nThen we have the risk takers, ranging from those that lean heavily with the zodiac sign such as Starbucks, which launched a popular pig mug (they produce animal zodiac sign mugs every year), to other brands that are attempting to appropriate elements of the pig subtly into their campaigns.\nSome don't land, like Astro's CNY mascot, which looks like a stillborn monkey-pig lab experiment in a zipped-up red hoodie.\nThen there are inspired choices, like in 1 Utama, where three 'piggy banks' make up the base of the mall's main decorative attraction. But you probably didn't notice it because they share the stage with huge lavish daffodil and floral arrangements that draw the eye away from the piggy banks, that can easily be mistaken for smiling Chinese drums.\n\"We realise pigs are a little sensitive.

It describes and explains the family business system at a single point in time. This makes it easier to understand the important characteristics of the business, family and ownership group and how these groups interact to influence the performance of the business and the family. It has become the dominant paradigm for understanding family business systems worldwide.\nThis framework clarifies, in graphic terms, the three interdependent and overlapping groups - family, business and owners - that comprise the family business system. As a result of the overlap of these groups, there are seven interest groups, each with its own legitimate viewpoints, goals and dynamics. According to Prof Davis, the views of each sector must be respected and integrated in order to set direction for the family business system. The long-term success of family business systems depends on the functioning and mutual support of each of these groups.\nSays Prof Davis: \"It is durable because it is simple, has immediate face validity and captures enough complexity in family business systems to help researchers, academics, managers and families think more clearly about the strengths and challenges of these systems.\""}

There had been two other cave-ins which aren\u2019t described in detail in the reports.\nThe documents say both reported collapses had spanned the entire six-metre width of a passage, as slabs of rock fell and left a ceiling gap up to almost four metres deep. The first rock fall ran over 18 metres along the underground roadway, while the second was about a third of the length of a football field.\nThe delay in reporting the falls resulted in a citation for contravention of s. 32.1(f) of the province\u2019s underground mining regulations, which require a report within 24 hours of an unplanned roof fall that results in conditions that include a blockage of the mine roadway, a disruption of work for more than an hour, and/or an impairment of ventilation in the mine.\nThere was no fine for that infraction.\nSix days following the revelation of the cave-ins, the Labour Department allowed the mine to resume operations after approving more roof support systems and more monitoring.\nAlmost 11 weeks later, while the mine was on a Christmas break, there was another cave-in on Dec. 18, then on Dec. 28 there was another collapse in the same general area.\nAs with the earlier collapses, no workers were injured. The mine\u2019s licence to operate was suspended after the Dec. 28 incident, with a requirement that the operators provide a revised plan for their roof support system.\nKameron Coal, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cline Mining Corp., has declined to specifically comment on why it didn\u2019t report the cave-ins until the inspectors arrived, though the safety reports indicate they had been taking measures to shore up the roof in the areas of the collapse.\nIn an e-mailed statement sent last Thursday, Shannon Campbell, vice president of project development at the Donkin mine, said a revised roof support plan was sent to the Nova Scotia Department of Labour and Advanced Education on Jan. 16 and after further consultations a new procedure was submitted on Jan. 31.\nThe mine has been given approval to resume production on one panel in a limited area. Meanwhile, the department has contracted an independent third-party expert who is expected to make a site visit within the next two weeks.\n\u201cWe are focused on safely completing the work at hand and look forward to progressing through the details of the new ground control plan with the provincial regulators.

The developer first broke onto the scene with the extremely impressive Max Payne in 2001, and the studio earned plaudits for the cinematic nature of the game and its excellent implementation of bullet time mechanics.\nSince then, the developer has gone from ambition to ambition, first with the shifting nightmare world of Alan Wake, and then with the complex narrative structure of Quantum Break. After that, however, Remedy began working on a secret project, and the developer remained almost silent on what the project known as P7 would ever become.\nHowever, now was clearly the right time for Remedy and publisher 505 Games to announce the game to the public, and it's made one serious first impression. The title was revealed as part of the PlayStation press conference, and the trailer's surreal use of geometry and fantastic scene building means that already fans of Remedy's work are looking out for more. The trailer can be seen at the top of this article.\nFrom the trailer, it's clear that Remedy has taken several cues from previous games it has developed, with Control once more a third-person action game with a requirement to use supernatural abilities. In Control, users play as Jesse Faden, the director of a mysterious agency in New York that has been attacked by an unknown threat. Exactly what that threat is remains to be seen, but already from the trailer footage it is apparent that the rules of gravity no longer apply.\nThis gives Control a truly unique feel, with the game making use of the versatility that video game development provides to build levels that, at least from the trailer, look to be some kind of cross between M.C. Escher and Christopher Nolan's Inception. Meanwhile, the supernatural element seems to have resulted in some strange and potentially terrifying enemies, so players will have to navigate not only shifting walls but vicious attacks.\nRemedy was also able to give a release date of sorts for Control, with the game due to arrive at some point in 2019. Unfortunately, at the moment there is nothing more concrete on the cards, but hopefully a more finite release date will be revealed as the gaming community begins to learn more about this mysterious project."}

Bush administration officials say they are working hard to find the source of the anthrax powder. But there has been criticism of the way the administration has handled the anthrax scare.\nThe administration's homeland security director, Tom Ridge, sought to reassure local officials from the around the country meeting in Washington Friday that the anthrax threat is under control. \"We are under attack from a different kind of enemy who is using different kinds of weapons, weapons designed to [cause] fear and weapons designed to panic and disrupt,\" he said. \"We are not going to let them get away with that. We'll find them, we'll get them, and then working with you over the months and years ahead, we'll develop an even stronger prevention mechanism and an even stronger response mechanism.\"\nAt the White House, presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters that the anthrax found last week in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle was not necessarily the work of a foreign government as some experts have speculated. He said the lethal dose of anthrax contained in the letter could just as easily have been produced by a microbiologist in a sophisticated laboratory.\nMeanwhile, postal workers around the country are growing increasingly concerned about the spread of anthrax through the mail. Postal union officials in New York and Miami were urging that some facilities be closed so that both workers and buildings could be tested for anthrax. Judy Johnson, a postal union official in Miami, said, \"If you delay our testing, we are as good as dead, which has already been proven in Washington.\"\nWhile the Bush administration's foreign policy team has been getting generally high marks for its handling of the war on terrorism, the administration's approach on dealing with anthrax has gotten mixed reviews.\nAdministration officials have at times given conflicting statements about the anthrax mailings and have been criticized for not moving sooner to protect postal workers from possible exposure. As commentator Joseph From said on this week's \"Issues in the News\" program here on VOA, \"The scare is obviously serious. A lot of people have been panicked by it, particularly people in the post office. And the Bush administration has stumbled on this and quite badly. There has been a lack of coordination. We have had conflicting stories from the FBI, from the health authorities.\"\nEven some experts on bio-terrorism admit they were taken by surprise by the anthrax attacks. C.J. Peters is with the Center for Biodefense at the University of Texas. Interviewed on NBC television, he said, \"None of us believed that you would have such a lethal powder that would go out in an envelope. We always thought that that would be disseminated in an air conditioning system or as a release into the environment, which I think makes an important point. When you think you know what the terrorists are going to do, you are making a big mistake.\"\nBut Mr. Peters also believes that the administration's response to the anthrax scare has been measured and reasonable. \"I think we are better off than we were three or four years ago,\" he said, \"but it is very difficult to prepare for something like this. The massive logistical problem of treating people with antibiotics if there were thousands of people exposed is a tremendous problem.\"\nDespite concerns about the administration's handling of the anthrax scare, a new poll indicates that more than three in five Americans still have"}

The program launched in 1990 but was greatly limited after public reaction to images of heavily militarized police in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., and other sites of civil unrest.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced the move Monday morning at the Fraternal Order of Police convention in Nashville, and said the president would do so by executive order. The police union had lobbied for the restoration of the program, and Trump said he would do so during his campaign.\nThe decision to restore the flow of military weaponry to civilian law enforcement was the latest move by the Trump administration both to stake out a hard-line stance on law and order as they view it, and to undo actions by the Obama administration which were unpopular in some quarters of law enforcement.\nThe FOP leadership applauded the rescinding of Obama\u2019s restrictions on the program. \u201cProtective equipment is essential to officer and public safety in a wide variety of life and death situations,\u201d its president, Chuck Canterbury, told The Post. \u201cThis decisive action by President Trump fulfills a promise he made to the FOP during the campaign, and police officers nationwide are grateful to him. \u2026 The previous administration was more concerned about the image of law enforcement being too \u2018militarized\u2019 than they were about our safety,\u201d Canterbury said.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted his disapproval of the move shortly after it was announced, and then said he would be reintroducing his \u201cStop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act,\u201d which prohibits transfer of equipment deemed \u201coffensive\u201d such as weapons, but not equipment used for \u201cdefensive\u201d purposes, such as helmets or body armor.\nThe transfer of extra weapons and gear from the Defense Department occurred through the \u201c1033 Program\u201d created by Congress in 1990, originally for use in drug enforcement by federal and state law enforcement. But in 1997, the program was expanded to include all law enforcement agencies, though with a preference for those with anti-drug or anti-terrorism programs. The White House said the 1033 program had resulted in the transfer of more than $5.4 billion worth of surplus military equipment to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies, to include armored vehicles, riot gear, rifles, ammunition and computers that had been scrapped by the Defense Department. Police paid nothing more than transportation or shipping costs to get the equipment.\nBut during the civil unrest that erupted after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August 2014, many were troubled by scenes of oversized military vehicles and heavily armored police pointing high-powered rifles at protesters. The 1033 program received new scrutiny as public records showed how much military surplus had been distributed to local police nationally. In January 2015, Obama created a working group to make recommendations to reform the program, which called for creating lists of \u201cprohibited equipment\u201d that could no longer be distributed to police and \u201ccontrolled equipment\u201d that could only be provided for a demonstrated need.\nThe \u201cprohibited equipment\u201d included tracked armored vehicles and weaponized vehicles of any kind, rifles and ammunition of .50-caliber or higher, and grenade launchers.

This story has been getting lots of mainstream press attention, but I want to focus on the BBC report because it's a good one, yet still needs a few more words of content if the goal is to be consistent with what the ancient Christian churches teach about the role of those in the \"great cloud of witnesses\" who are called saints.\nThe signing of a decree by Pope Benedict XVI recognising that a miracle took place at the intercession of John Paul II represents the final step to beatification for the late pontiff.\nIt is the culmination of a process that was initiated officially in June 2005, two months after his death, but that had been called for by his faithful even before he breathed his last.\nFrench nun Sister Marie Simon-Pierre said she and her community prayed constantly to John Paul for a miracle.\nThe signing of a decree by Pope Benedict XVI recognising that a miracle took place at the intercession of John Paul II represents the final step to beatification for the late pontiff. It is the culmination of a process that was initiated officially in June 2005, two months after his death, but that had been called for by his faithful even before he breathed his last.\nNow, as often happens in mainstream coverage of issues of this kind, these sentences make it sound as if the nuns only prayed \"to\" John Paul for their sister's healing. I am sure that this is not the case, based on Catholic teachings. It would be more accurate to say that the sisters repeatedly asked him to pray \"with\" them -- acting as another intercessor -- as they prayed to God and to Jesus Christ as the agents of healing. They would certainly be asking for the intercessory prayers of St. Mary, the mother of Jesus, and others as well. Still, I know that the \"prayed to\" grammatical construction is very common and that, in and of itself, there is no problem with that.\nSo let's head on to the main issue. Note that the BBC story accurately says that the proper Catholic authorities have ruled \"that a miracle took place at the intercession of John Paul II.\" The problem is that the story never says that God, not John Paul, performed the healing.\nNow, I hear you. Some of you are saying, \"Of course it was God that did the healing. Everybody knows that.\"\nActually, I have heard plenty of non-Catholics claim that Catholics believe that they pray to a saint so that the saint has the power to heal someone, simple as that.

There have also been demonstrations on a crane in Manchester, on Bristol's Clifton Suspension Bridge, and on gantries over key roads in London.\nBefore Christmas, an army of militant Santas marched on Parliament.\nThe group has admitted protesters are running the risk of imprisonment but says its tactics are a \"last resort\", that its frustrated members have \"exhausted every possible avenue\".\n\"We are a bunch of guys who are going to be making some pretty scary sacrifices. We know many of us are going to go to prison but there is tremendous resolve,\" Mr O'Connor has said.\n\"It comes down to the simple fact that we face a Herculean struggle. The politicians are not dealing with this with the degree of urgency this matter deserves.\"\nMr O'Connor says fathers have been fighting \"a steady erosion\" of their rights for 30 years, without success. F4J's own meetings with the government in the year and a half since it started have, he says, proved fruitless.\n\"It is now at the point where we have to fight for basic rights. So many people have lost contact with their children through the courts, it was inevitable something like Fathers-4-Justice was going to emerge,\" Mr O'Connor says.\nHe believes the group has already achieved considerable success in its first aim of raising awareness of a problem that has \"gone unnoticed and unreported\".\nBut F4J's second aim is a tougher proposition - it wants an overhaul of family law within two years.\nFigures show that mothers gain custody in four out of five disputes - F4J believes that 40% of fathers subsequently lose contact with their children within two years. Mr O'Connor says some of these cases will be due to fathers turning their backs, but he claims that the \"vast majority\" are due to mothers denying access.\nFamily courts issue contact orders in an attempt to ensure access for the parent not living with their children, but Mr O'Connor says these are worthless because they are not enforced.\n\"People have complete carte blanche to stop contact, knowing that the judge will do absolutely nothing about it,\" he says.\nThe government admits that the enforcement of contact orders is \"an issue\" that needs to be addressed. A Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) spokesman says \"courts are understandably reluctant to impose jail terms or fines on mothers who have children to look after\".\nBut F4J believes the solution is to give parents and grandparents \"a legal right to see their children and grandchildren\".\n\"The law says you have no legal right to see your children - only a right to apply to a court to see them - but you have a legal obligation to pay for them,\" says Mr O'Connor.

It\u2019s a familiar, comforting spot. Many members of my partner and I\u2019s extended family live here, in the same small, tight-knit community that I grew up in. Now I\u2019m raising my family here too.\nThis intergenerational community would never have been possible if we didn\u2019t have access to affordable housing. For us, it takes the form of rent-stabilized apartments. But many other New Yorkers are not, or are no longer, so lucky.\nThere are only about 1 million units of rent-stabilized housing left in New York City, a 20 percent decrease since 1981. Rent stabilization, a law that provides for annual caps on the rent hikes landlords can impose, is one of the best regulations we have for maintaining true affordability. So it is no surprise that as rent-stabilized units are vacated, landlords swoop in to move them into deregulated, market-rate status. The law itself has been under attack for decades and continues to be eroded by lawmakers and developers looking to reap high profits in \u201cdesirable\u201d neighborhoods.\nLow- and middle-income families across the entire city are facing major difficulties in finding homes they can afford and staying in them. Over the last decade, the increase in rent costs has been double that of wages. Simultaneously, even with decent inclusionary zoning practices \u2014 rules that mandate that any new development or rehab include a percentage of affordable units \u2014 these families are being closed out of the vast majority of new housing being built in the five boroughs. \u201cAffordability\u201d is defined using a calculation of Area Median Income (AMI), and that takes huge swaths of a region into account \u2014 lumping millionaires, middle-class families and the working poor together. In a city with one of the highest wealth disparities in the nation, \u201caffordable\u201d homes are effectively out of reach for low-income and extremely low-income New Yorkers.\nIn addition, even those who can \u201cafford\u201d to remain \u2014 often, by just scraping by \u2014 have to prepare for living in a drastically overhauled neighborhood. Such a neighborhood is one in which affordable food, schools, health care and other services are no longer available because the local economy has shifted to meet the desires and needs of a new, wealthier demographic. This is the full picture of gentrification.\nThe situation is not unique to New York. We are in the midst of a national housing affordability crisis the likes of which this country has never known. According to the Center for American Progress\u2019 2012 report, The Housing Market is Not Only for Homeowners, nationally, rents climbed 4 percent in 2012 alone and another 4.6 percent in 2013 \u2014 and are expected to increase by at least 4 percent per year in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, real median renter incomes fell over much of the beginning of the century, ending 13 percent lower in 2012 than in 2000. Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies\u2019 2013 report, America\u2019s Rental Housing: Evolving Markets and Needs, revealed that almost half of renters, 46 percent, earn below $30,000 annually, including 22 percent whose income is below $15,000 \u2014 roughly equivalent to working year"}

Trump had every right to undo that decision and return the issue to Congress, where it belongs.\nI hope that this order is swiftly appealed and reversed. It\u2019s a naked power grab by the courts and has no basis in law.\nThe judge has put his absurd decision on hold for that 90-day period.\nThe Court further concludes that, under the APA, DACA\u2019s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful. Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program.\nThis is nonsense. Obama\u2019s proffered justification for undermining Congressional legislation in the area of immigration was that he was making a resource allocation decision in enforcement, which is an executive function.

As they fall, you find time to say a silent prayer, \"Please don't shatter.\" Often as is not, they don't entirely survive the impact and we end up carrying around a broken screen.\nGorilla Glass, which first arrived in 2007, remains popular among smartphone manufacturers including Samsung which uses it on its Galaxy smartphones and, reportedly, Apple, especially because it offers the promise, if not always the reality, of strength and a scratch-and break-proof screen.\nThis fourth generation of Corning's ultra-thin glass, though, is potentially even stronger than previous generations. And to get to that point, Corning had to look at hundreds of new and broken smartphones. According to Cliff Hund President of Corning East Asia, the company analyzed the fracture patterns on these phones, looking for the primary cause, which often turned out to be \"the result of sharp-particle contact\" often on, yes, asphalt and concrete.\nCorning then bought a hundred new phones and started dropping them on, no, not asphalt, but 180-grit sandpaper, which better approximated a fresh and not worn-smooth road. In the end, Hund said Corning discovered that a face drop would be the toughest test \"because it has highest degree of contact with rough particle surface and highest degree of stress.\"\nHere's one of the devices Corning uses to perfrom drop tests.\nWhen I noted that I've seen many cracked phone screens that were clearly caused by a drop in which the corner of the of smartphone hit the ground, Hund reminded me that a big part of a phone screen's ability to withstand a fall has to do with the interaction between their Gorilla Glass and the phone design. Corning does, when possible, work directly with manufacturers to develop the best screen buffer.\nWhile Gorilla Glass 4 still uses Corning's trademark fusion draw process, it does feature a slightly different chemical process and different design and processing formulation (Corning would not go into details). Gorilla Glass 4 is, at .4 millimeter, no thinner than Gorilla Glass 3.\nThe result is glass that will, according to Corning, survive that dreaded face drop (from a height of 1 meter) 80% of the time. Soda Lime glass, which is more or less regular glass, but used in cheapo Chinese phones, breaks 100%, said Hund. He also noted that Gorilla Glass 4 outperforms the alumina silicate glass composite used on some other smartphones.\nHow does Gorilla Glass 4 compare to the current \"It\" composite material, Sapphire Glass, which is currently in use on Apple's Touch ID home button and on the upcoming Apple Watch?\n\"We study all competitive materials and we\u2019ve studied Sapphire quite a bit,\" said Hund. \"What we find is that when you subject it to abrasion, to naked eye it's incredibly scratch resistant, even beyond Gorilla, but beyond the naked eye, microscopic, abrasion does occur.\"\nWhen that happens, according to Hund, Sapphire ends being more vulnerable to breakage in a fall. He also claims that Gorilla Glass is lighter, offers better light transmission and takes far less energy to produce.\nCorning expects to commercialize the new Glass before the end of this year."}

It also adds to a growing body of evidence that changes in elk distribution and vegetation conditions in northern Yellowstone since wolf reintroduction in the mid-1990s are not caused by wolves altering elk movement behavior.\nUtah State University researchers Dan MacNulty and Michel Kohl co-led the study, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology, with Jeremy Cusack (University of Stirling), Tim Coulson (University of Oxford), Matt Metz (University of Montana), Doug Smith and Dan Stahler (Yellowstone National Park). Several organizations funded the research, including the National Science Foundation, Natural Environment Research Council, Yellowstone Forever, The Tapeats Fund, Perkins-Prothro Foundation, and the National Park Service. The Park-led wolf and elk monitoring programs provided data for the project.\nThe team used global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars to track the movements of elk and wolves across four winters between 2012 and 2016. They tracked 34 adult female elk and at least one member of each dominant wolf pack. The collars recorded the location of the animals every 1-3 hours, providing comprehensive data on how they used the landscape. The team tested if elk avoided wolves that were in close proximity, and if elk avoided \u2018risky areas\u2019 where they might be killed by wolves, including where wolf densities were high; where wolves had previously killed elk; and open grasslands where wolves often hunted.\n\u201cWe compared recorded elk movements with those from a simulation that described how elk would move if they completely ignored wolves and risky areas\u201d says MacNulty, who has studied wolf-elk interactions in northern Yellowstone since 1995 and is an associate professor in USU\u2019s Department of Wildland Resources and Ecology Center. \u201cIn 90% of cases, there was no difference between real and simulated elk movements, indicating that our sample of real elk mostly ignored the risk of wolf predation\u201d.\nAccording to Cusack, the lead author of the study, most elk did not alter the location and configuration of their annual winter home ranges to minimize overlap with wolves and risky areas, and none bothered to steer around wolves that were in the immediate vicinity. \u201cA few elk avoided open grasslands during daylight hours when wolves were most active, which mirrors the result of a separate recent study that examined finer-scale elk movements in the early 2000s when wolves and elk were more numerous,\u201d explained Cusack.\nThe findings are also in line with other studies of northern Yellowstone elk, including one that compared elk movements before and after wolf reintroduction and found that \u201cin winter, elk did not spatially separate themselves from wolves\u201d. Another study reported that \u201celk did not grossly modify their migration timing, routes, or use areas after wolf restoration\u201d.\nMacNulty and Cusack estimated that elk in their study encountered wolves once every 7 to 11 days, and previous research found that elk frequently survive their encounters with wolves.

Holder case in Washington, Feb. 27, 2013.\nDoes the GOP Really Want to Woo Blacks and Latinos?\nAt the Supreme Court argument Wednesday on the Voting Rights Act, Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2013 likely the deciding vote \u2013 had two potentially devastating words for those who want to see the landmark voting rights law upheld: \u201cTimes change.\u201d It can be perilous to try to predict what the court will do based on the questions the Justices ask at oral argument. But those questions suggest that there may well be five votes \u2014 a majority \u2014 for striking down key parts of the act.\nThe Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965 to ensure that black voters in the Jim Crow South were allowed to cast ballots. In the 48 years since, it has been a tool for the federal government to prevent states from racial gerrymandering \u2014 drawing district lines to stop minorities from getting elected \u2014 and election-day obstructions, like moving polling places at the last minute in minority neighborhoods.\nConservatives have long been at war with the Voting Rights Act. They argue that it gives an unfair preference to minority voters, infringes on states\u2019 rights, and is an abuse of power by Congress. The case the court is considering, Shelby County v. Holder, challenges a key part of the act: section 5, which requires all or part of 16 states to \u201cpre-clear\u201d changes with the Justice Department to ensure that they do not unfairly burden minority voters.\nJustice Antonin Scalia \u2014 as is his wont \u2014 was less subtle. He called the act \u201ca perpetuation of racial entitlement.\u201d Justice Alito echoed Chief Justice Robert\u2019s concerns, asking why Congress did not make a \u201cnew determination\u201d about which states and localities should be covered. Justice Clarence Thomas did not ask any questions \u2014 his longstanding practice \u2014 but four years ago he voted to strike down the act, and it is all but certain he will again.\nThe court\u2019s four more liberal Justices used their questioning to underscore the reasons why the act is still needed \u2013 and why Congress had ample constitutional authority to enact it. Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the lawyer for Shelby County that even if parts of the South have changed \u201cyour county pretty much hasn\u2019t.\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer compared the racial discrimination that created the need for the act to a disease, and said that things may have changed to some degree \u201cBut we know one thing: the disease is still there in the state.\u201d All these four liberal Justices can do without a fifth on their side, however, is write a dissent.\nCases do not always come out the way they appear headed in oral argument. Justice Kennedy, or one of the other conservative Justices, may ultimately balk at striking down a key part of a revered civil rights law that has been enacted repeatedly by Congress with bipartisan support. In the end, the court may use this case to give the Voting Rights Act a ringing endorsement. But right now, that is probably not the smart bet."}

The dissenter on the three-judge panel, Judge Carolyn King, complained that the appeals court's ruling had been unreasonably delayed.\n\"I have a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made. That mistake has been exacerbated by the extended delay that has occurred in deciding this 'expedited' appeal.

For decades it circulated only in a small geographic area in equatorial Africa and Asia, and mostly among primates.\nThe current epidemic began in early 2015 in Brazil, and since then has spread throughout South and Central America.\nIn February 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the pandemic a public health emergency and five months later, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first case of mosquito-borne infection in the US in residents of Florida, in a neighbourhood near Miami.\nThe biological behaviour of viruses is often unpredictable, which makes it difficult for scientists to work out how to stop them, Dr Pletnev explained.\nZika belongs to the Flavivirus group of viruses, which also includes West Nile, dengue and yellow fever. Viruses in this family each have a single strand of RNA - a nucleic acid present in all living cells - but they're notoriously difficult to manipulate and clone.\nTo overcome this problem, the team, which included researchers from the University of Texas and the US Food and Drug Administration, collected a viral strain from an infected patient in Brazil who was showing symptoms of Zika in 2015.\nTo reduce toxicity and stabilise the 'ZIKV cDNA clone' during growth in Escherichia coli bacteria, they added introns - a segment of a DNA molecule that interrupts the sequence of genes - to the full viral cloned DNA genome.\nThey found the virus derived from the clone had less genetic diversity than its wild-type parent strain, and subsequent experiments showed the clone was attenuated, or less harmful than its parent.\nThe researchers made a number of"}

On any day, America features one million homeless throughout 50 states. If we can\u2019t figure out how to solve those monumental social problems, how do we think we can save the rest of the world by importing over 100,000 legal immigrants every 30 days into our country?\nDo you realize that Congress allows 22 to 25 million illegal aliens to remain in our country without fear of deportation? (Source: Yale University Study, Oct 2018) How do they do that? Congress refuses to enforce Federal Law Section 8 USC 1324, within our nation. In fact, employers of illegal aliens do not face arrest, prosecution or prison because your two senators and House member refuse to do their jobs.\nWhat do you pay? According the latest figures at www.FAIR.org , you pay $113,000,000,000.00 (billion) annually to maintain those illegals as to educating and feeding their children, along with medical care, and ESL courses, plus 12 agencies who must address this invasion with your money.\nBut that\u2019s not all, each state pays into the millions of dollars for illegals operating in their area. Illegal migrants cost Michigan $928 million in 2018. In California, it\u2019s into the billions of dollars as they feature over four million illegal aliens and possible as high as six million. They\u2019re slithering into welfare offices in all the major cities around America.\nDo you think it\u2019s going to stop? Do you think it\u2019s going to become better? Do you think you will ever stop paying for legal and illegal immigrants? Answer: sorry, you will pay more and more as our U.S. Congress continues to import a permanent underclass into America.\nWhy do you think millions of people around the world live in misery? Why do their countries suffer poverty, hopelessness and dictators? Answer: their leaders and citizens lack the intellectual horsepower to create viable social, political and economic systems.\nWhy are Western countries successful?

Born in Dublin in 1930, Johnston lived enough of her life in Catholic Ireland to experience the damage religion did to a whole generation of people.\nIn her 17th novel, Shadowstory, she takes on the topic of 'ne temere', the old command that for a Protestant to marry a Catholic they had to sign a solemn vow to raise any children resulting from that marriage in the Catholic faith.\n\"A whole two generations of Protestants lost their identity because of this. My mother's next sister up had to go to Holyhead to get married because not a priest in Dublin would marry them because he was Catholic.\n\"What's strange about that family is they had four children, three of whom threw the church over their shoulders anyway, and the fourth one became a sort of mad wannabe popeman,\" she chuckles.\nJohnston is a formidable woman, tall and rangy, with a no-nonsense air.

The project would recharge the lake using resources from another central African body of water: the Ubangi River. Nigeria has already spent $5 million on a study looking at the feasibility of recharging the lake.\nThe lake has been considerably shrinking since 1963, as seen in the below figure from the chapter on Confronting Climate Change in Foresight Africa 2017. Between 1963 and 2013, the lake lost 90 percent of its water mass, shrinking from 25,000km2 to 2,500km2. The reduction in the size of the lake has threatened the resources and livelihoods of the 50 million residents in that region. Another challenge in the region is the threat posed by the Boko Haram insurgency. There are 2.8 million refugees in the Lake Chad region, and estimates state that there are 9.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the region.\nAccording to Aliou Dia, the UNDP Africa\u2019s Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change team leader, climate change might exacerbate current tensions and conflict. He says that radicalization arises from religious, ideological, economic, and historical situations where social, employment, poverty, and governance problems, among others, have created social exclusion and mistrust, adding, \u201cClimate change, on the other hand, affects our natural capital (water, food, land, forest, biodiversity, etc.). Compounded with more frequent occurrence of natural disasters (drought, floods, landslides, cyclones, etc.), it leads to disruption, as livelihoods are affected and local economic opportunities lost. The inability of fragile governments to meet the needs of their population or provide protection in the face of climate change-induced hardship can trigger frustration, lead to tensions between different ethnic and religious groups within countries and to political radicalization. This could destabilize countries and even entire regions.\u201d The question over whether climate change causes conflict, though, is still under debate, as seen in Dr. Vesselin Popovski\u2019s Foresight Africa 2017 viewpoint.\nThe Lake Chad region is not the only Africa region affected by severe climate conditions. The El Nino-induced drought has caused widespread hunger through Eastern and Southern Africa. Last month, Kenyan members of parliament urged the national government to declare hunger a national crisis in the aim to attract the necessary international attention. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, nearly 12 million people are struggling to feed themselves amid low rainfall, poor harvest, and livestock deaths. The FAO has issued a pre-famine warning and is urging the community to act promptly in order to avoid a repeat of the 2011 famine that left 260,000 people dead.\nCorrection: On April 24, 2017, it came to our attention that the river used to recharge Lake Chad was incorrectly identified as the Rangin River. The statement has been corrected to identify the Ubangi River."}

The airline failed to raise enough money through corporate bonds and was banking on subsidies from Iceland\u2019s government, but that help never came. After eight years in operation, WOW posted a notice on its website on March 28 that all flights were cancelled and advised ticketed passengers to look for \u201crescue fares\u201d with other airlines.\nWOW Air launched in 2011 as a discount regional carrier that offered cheap, no-frills fares designed to undercut legacy players. Along the way, it decided to compete with the bigger airlines, specifically Icelandair, by offering transatlantic flights. That decision required WOW to upgrade its fleet with larger jets capable of making longer trips.\nVolatile oil prices were another factor in the airline\u2019s ruination. While airline stocks benefited from falling oil prices last year, crude rebounded by more than 20% early this year, according to Barron\u2019s. And prices are now rising faster than analysts predicted. In a statement, WOW Air said increasing fuel prices were partly to blame for a $33.7 million loss in the first three quarters of 2018.\nMixa agreed, saying WOW\u2019s move toward transatlantic flights coincided with rising fuel costs to become the \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d for the airline.\nAccording to The New York Times, WOW sought an injection of cash through bonds and had reached a preliminary agreement with Indigo Partners, a private equity firm in Phoenix, Arizona. Those talks quickly fell apart, along with discussions about a potential acquisition by Icelandair.\n\u201cA big problem for WOW was a lack of equity,\u201d Matthiasson said.\nThe Icelandic government was aware of the airline\u2019s troubles but unwilling to step in with financial assistance, despite the country\u2019s growing attraction as a tourist destination, the professor noted. Foreign visitors have increased from 459,000 in 2010 to 2.3 million in 2018, according to the Icelandic Tourist Board.\nAccording to Tsoukalas, subsidies are often justified in the interest of the public good, but they create fairness issues for competition.\nWOW flights ferried 30% of visitors to the country last year, and some analysts have predicted a 16% drop in tourism as a result of the airline\u2019s collapse, according to Reuters. But the professors said the effect is unclear because other airlines, including Icelandair, will likely step in to fill the void.\nWOW joins a pantheon of hundreds of airlines that have shut down over the years, including US Airways, Aloha Air, Air Berlin, India\u2019s Kingfisher Airlines, Britain\u2019s Monarch Airways and Denmark\u2019s Primera Air, which suddenly shuttered in October and left thousands of passengers with worthless tickets."}

It also would be given a coordination agent that made sure applications ran in the correct sequence and a transaction manager that supervised transactions across dissimilar applications.\nThe proposed set is called Web Services-Composite Application Framework, or WS-CAF. Today's leading Web services handle such coordination issues is \"in a very ad hoc manner, if at all,\" says Mark Little, chief team architect for Arjuna.\nThe proposed standards will take the guesswork and ambiguities out of how to coordinate services from scattered systems into one composite application, or new Web service, says Ed Julson, Sun's group manager of Web services standards and technology.\nThe alternative, Julson says, is to go forward with competing methods of resolving service issues, as is the case with two of today's Web-services security standards: Web Services-Security proposed by IBM, Microsoft and VeriSign, and Web Services-Reliability proposed by Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Oracle, Sonic Software, and Sun.\nAmong the standards bodies that might receive the Sun proposal are the Oasis Open consortium of vendors setting XML standards; the World Wide Web Consortium; and the Internet Engineering Task Force. \"From a pure technology standpoint, the group isn't breaking new ground,\" says Stephen O'Grady of Red Monk, a market research group. Sun and partners are making use of existing technologies, sometimes already in use in deployed Web services, he says. But \"it's a novel and unique approach for creating composite applications composed of distinct Web services.\"\nThe most significant part of the proposal may prove to be the way it defines a way to manage transactions in the Web-services context, O'Grady says.\nWeb Service Context (WS-CTX), which provides a shared runtime environment to access the context or system specifics of a needed Web service and provides a mean to manage it.\nWeb Service Coordination Framework (WS-CF), which defines a software agent to handle context management. A service that was part of the composite application would register with the agent, which would tell it when to run and supply its service or results.\nWeb Service Transaction Management (WS-TXM), which defines three transaction protocols that can be plugged into the coordination framework and make use of existing transaction managers, such as IBM's CICS. One protocol would provide the dual-phase commit of the typical relational database system, but use it in a context of one application conducting an application with another dissimilar application. The dual-phase commit assures that both systems acknowledge the transaction has completed. Another protocol would be geared to handle long-running transactions, such as a transaction called for once a week or month by a Web service. The third protocol would be used to manage asynchronous business-process flows, where one system might not be running when another orders a transaction.\n\"There will be built-in interoperability issues as soon as developers start to build"}

What specific choices did you and Nick make to achieve that goal?\nMichelle Dean: We both made the decision that certain things that came to light in the reporting weren\u2019t integral to the story and didn\u2019t need to be focused on. So there\u2019s a certain amount of just picking and choosing the parts of the story that we thought were more emotionally resonant as opposed to just shocking.\nAnd then, a really direct way that it happened, and this is credited to Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, who did Episodes 1, 2, and 6\u2014as our pilot director, she got to set a lot of the tone of our show. She went into [the Blanchards\u2019] house, which is very colorful, obviously, in real life, and she elevated the palette in a way that I really admire. She made it possible to an audience to see why they found the world that they lived in so beautiful, and I feel like that choice about the set design informed a lot of what we were thinking about: how do we dramatize this so that people can see the situation in the way that the people who lived it did, as closely as possible?\nHow did you decide which aspects of the Blanchards\u2019 inner lives would be ethical to imagine, and which wouldn\u2019t be?\nIt\u2019s a really interesting question, and I think we did this as thoughtfully and consciously as we could under the circumstances.

The Finance Bill should never have been able to change Aadhaar, but we must remember that it was the same \u201cmoney bill route\u201d that gave birth to the Aadhaar Act a year ago.\nClassifying Aadhaar as a money bill was a brazen, unconstitutional and undemocratic strategy used to take advantage of the brute force of a majority in the Lok Sabha, and make the Rajya Sabha irrelevant. It was used once again this time to amend legislation that included the Aadhaar Act and 39 other amendments in many other laws that should have been examined by standing committees and received the approval of both Houses of Parliament before becoming a law. Article 110 of the Constitution and Rule 80 of Rules of Procedure of the Lok Sabha were overridden in a manner that completely undermined the spirit and framework of the Constitution.\nAmendments to the Aadhaar Act has made the Unique Identification (UID) mandatory for filing income tax returns and for holding a valid Permanent Account Number (PAN). So from July 1, those who don\u2019t have an Aadhaar card while filing tax returns will have their PAN cancelled and will be deemed to be committing a penal offence. That is as mandatory as it can get.\nThe poor have already been reeling under the force of compulsory (though \u201cnot mandatory\u201d) use of Aadhaar for receiving welfare benefits. This doublespeak is despite six Supreme Court orders that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for anything, including welfare benefits. The current set of amendments marks a significant expansion beyond the government\u2019s own pledge that Aadhaar would only be used for welfare delivery. By making it mandatory for something as non-welfare as income tax returns, the government has made it clear that Aadhaar numbers will be seeded with various data bases to track and put together all kinds of information related to citizens. This is not only an invasion of privacy, it is potential mass surveillance of all people and at all times. None of the governments can plead benevolence. Whether the UPA or now the NDA, they have in partnership with the corporate-commercial establishment \u2013 Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) \u2013 put in place a structure that can enable the highest level of exploitation of our data, firstly for commercial use and more dangerously the deepest state surveillance ever known in history. This will be true for this government and all others to come.\nTo understand the changes in the government\u2019s position on the use of Aadhaar, one has to understand the claim of \u201cuniqueness\u201d. The only reliable and \u201cunique\u201d tool, if any, of the UID is biometric data. That is why, the Aadhaar \u2018card\u2019 is not important, and can be printed from any computer. It is the storage and authentication of every person\u2019s unique biometric that gives UID its unique validity. The rest of the information can be easily misreported and misrepresented by the person concerned or the enrolment agency. That explains several cases of wrong names, address, age etc., on the Aadhaar card. In fact, for fraudsters or even terrorists, Aadhaar card is the best fake ID to create. The so-called card has no smart features or a hologram.\nThat is why seeding and using Aadhaar without biometric authentication is mischievous to its original intent. For"}

Two of the iPad kids were adopted by American families.\nOne of the most important lessons students learn during their time in Ecuador is that effective treatment often depends on understanding another culture.\n\u201cThis is especially important for physical therapists in American cities who often work with people from all over the world,\u201d said Donat.

{"idx": "36574", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Much has been made of the basic unfairness in how responsibility is shared between nations for ameliorating the refugee crisis. But the real question is the level of economic sharing that is needed to deal with its root causes, when the international response continues to be woefully inadequate.\nFollowing the first ever United Nations Summit on Refugees and Migrants last week, many civil society organisations and concerned citizens are taking stock of our government\u2019s collective response to this unprecedented global crisis. The UN Summit was two years in the making, and gave a rare opportunity for world leaders to step up their commitments to help refugees, as well as draw up a blueprint for a more effective international plan of action. Central to these negotiations was the need to share responsibility for dealing with the crisis more equitably among member states, which was one of the key principles reaffirmed in the outcome document. Yet there is little promise for the world\u2019s 21 million refugees that wealthy nations will be genuinely sharing\u2014and not further shirking\u2014their responsibilities to fulfil these vulnerable people\u2019s basic rights.\nBefore the summit convened, it was already clear that rich governments would not be placing the needs of refugees and migrants above their narrow national self-interest. Rights groups widely criticised the watered-down agreement adopted by the UN General Assembly, particularly a commitment to resettle 10 percent of the global refugee population annually (itself inadequate) that was later dropped from the negotiation text. Another omission was the hoped-for Global Compact on Responsibility Sharing for Refugees, which was intended to be one of the summit\u2019s main outcomes. Instead, any chance of a global solution is deferred for another 2 years of negotiations. What remains is a long list of general and vague commitments, without any kind of binding mechanism or targets decided for responsibility sharing between nations. More concrete pledges were made at a separate Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees, convened by President Obama with 50 other nations, who together promised to take in significantly more refugees this year and increase funding by $4.5bn. But even these promises lack a guarantee, and may be reneged upon by the United States in its next administration.\nSo where is the hope that the situation can improve while 34,000 people are forced to flee their homes each day due to conflict and persecution, many of them continuing to die in an attempt to reach safety? The shocking trends show no sign of abating, largely driven by violent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa that Western powers have had a substantial role in causing or exacerbating. Yet the responses we are seeing from governments are often far from the fundamental principles set down in international refugee law, as reaffirmed at the UN Summit. Europe is currently building more walls than during the height of the Cold War; billions of euros are being spent on deterrence measures and reactionary cooperation agreements that are having limited impact on the number of overall arrivals. Our own country, the UK, is admitting only a tiny proportion of Syrian refugees, while shamefully diverting part of the aid budget to control immigration from Africa. The new UK government\u2019s position is that those fleeing war zones should remain in the first safe country they reach\u2014effectively arguing that the refugee crisis is somebody else\u2019s problem.\nIt is not enough to question where is the hope, for where is the morality, the kindness, the basic compassion? In this era of growing polarisation, fear and prejudice, there are many ordinary citizens who stand in solidarity with refugees as they are forced from their homelands, stepping in with volunteering and rescue efforts where governments have failed.

Current law does not allow the city to padlock clubs immediately unless they have been the site of one criminal conviction and one subsequent arrest within a 12-month period.\nThe proposed bill would also require more stringent record-keeping for orders to vacate, including notification of the building's mortgage holder. It would put the burden for compliance on the owner of the building, broadly defined as any person in charge of the premises.\nIn the case of Happy Land, officials said, that would have meant Alex DiLorenzo 3d, the property owner, and Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe, principals in a realty concern that had taken a 30-year sublease on the site, as well as Elias Colon, the club operator, who died in the fire.\nThe bill would echo several provisions of a law proposed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch that died in the City Council last year, but it would also stiffen some aspects and omit others. For example, an owner of a club ordered vacated would have to post a bond of at least $25,000 before being allowed to reopen, instead of a $10,000 bond as in the Koch bill.\nMilton Mollen, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, and Corporation Counsel Victor A. Kovner are expected to outline the bill at a hearing of the Council's Public Safety Committee today.\nA spokeswoman for the Council, Peg Breen, said the hearing was intended to find out what went wrong in the Happy Land case and how to prevent a recurrence. She said the Council was considering ideas of its own.\nThe new proposal would drop a provision that owners of clubs ordered vacated for safety reasons carry a $1 million liability insurance policy before reopening. Like the Koch bill, it would provide for civil penalties of up to $1 million for safety violations that resulted in injury or death.\nUnder the proposal, if the city padlocked a premises, it would notify owners that they could request a hearing before the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, and receive a hearing within three days of their request."}

Now Jordan Boyle at the University of Leeds, UK, has done just that&colon; he has closely studied the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and written control software that mimics its unique motion.\nThe nematode can vary its wiggling frequency fourfold, giving it a wide range of speeds and undulating motions \u2013 and yet it has almost no easily detectable neural centre controlling this motion, Boyle says.\n\u201cIt has an unusually small nervous system, comprising just over 300 neurons. Rather than using a central neural subcircuit as a pattern generator, it seems to generate its undulatory motion using around 100 neurons in a way largely driven by feedback from stretch sensors along its body,\u201d he says.\nSo he has created a 2-metre-long, 16-centimetre-wide robot that moves similarly \u2013 thanks to sensors that control motion in the same way as the worm\u2019s. The robot has 12 articulated segments, each of which can swing from side to side using a geared motor in its centre.\nInstead of the nematode\u2019s stretch sensors, the robot senses the angle each segment describes with respect to its spine and control software uses this information to calculate the robot\u2019s overall undulation pattern and orientation. Microphones, carbon-dioxide sensors (sensing breath) and infrared cameras on its \u201chead\u201d would allow the robot to wriggle its way to people in trouble, says Boyle.\nInstead of constructing the 12 segments from aluminium, the worm-snake robot was made from tough nylon-based plastic in a 3D printer \u2013 cutting the cost to around \u00a32000, against the \u00a35000 aluminium would have cost.\nBoyle hopes to refine the design further. It certainly needs shrinking down, says Julie Ryan of International Rescue Corps, a UK-based group that rushes experienced rescuers to earthquake zones.\nRyan says they currently push 3-metre-long hoses just 4 centimetres wide into rubble so that cameras or breath sensors on the end of them can see, or sense, trapped people.\n\u201cThis robot invention sounds like it\u2019s on the big side \u2013 you need something relatively small. Maybe they\u2019ll need to make these in a variety of sizes,\u201d she says."}

My, how times have changed.\nTime is reporting that the days of going to Travelocity and Orbitz are being confused because of new startups and consolidations. At first, those two, along with Expedia and Priceline\u2019s \u201cName Your Own Price\u201d dominated travel for millions of people worldwide. As the websites grew in popularity and effectiveness, traditional travel agencies lost their market share, and were forced to close.\nThe next phase was the proliferation of new travel websites. The second generation brought us sites like Kayak and Trivago. The newer websites were able to find meta search engines that were getting tougher to find to get better deals. Quickly, Kayak was bought by Priceline, and Trivago was purchased by Expedia. However, instead of streamlining the market, the websites tended to provide the same information across the internet. No one website could distinguish itself from the other.\nFor now, the newest of the travel websites, CheapOAir, Homeaway, and Skyscanner, who utilize more meta-search data to find deals with travel agents, seem to be the way to go, representing a return to the more traditional reliance on travel agencies to book trips.\nSo, what are some step a potential traveller can take to still find that great deal? All the previously mentioned websites can still help find good deals with airfare, as well as booking hotel rooms and securing rental cars. Take some basic steps while looking to book, and you\u2019re on your way to your travel destination.\nThe NCBJ recommends that first and foremost, you decide where you want to go. That sounds simple enough, but for college students readying for spring break, there are many potential destinations. Now you can find a travel plan using those websites. Keep your eyes open for potential package deals, which can include hotel rooms, or rooms and a rental car. The long-term savings could be quite considerable. There is also what you might call mystery discounts, deals that come and go rather quickly. If you see such a deal pop up, do not hesitate, because it will sell quickly and be gone for good.\nAnother possibility is, if you\u2019ve found a way to your destination, use a lodging-only website, like AirBNB, to book a place to stay. AirBNB specializes in rooms, apartments, homes, so you can pretty much find something that will fit your budget and your needs.\nFinally, for the truly adventurous, there is the \u201cLet Them Pick It\u201d option. You tell the website how much you want to spend, and the website will choose the destination for you, along with room and rental car, if you so choose. Whichever way you choose to go, have fun going."}

What better way to increase the awareness and prestige of a character than with a well-made and decently-promoted video game?\nRocksteady helped take an already popular Batman and elevate him even more with the Arkham games, and Beenox has done a fair job of keeping Spider-Man in the limelight under Activision's banner. So with the right developer and a good enough gameplay concept at the center of the game's design, there's a few characters who could really shine with the proper spotlight shown on them within the interactive entertainment market.\nThis list converges on a few comic book characters that definitely deserve a game; and not just based on how popular they are in the community. The list briefly discusses how these games could differ from the norm while also playing up to the attributes and thematic elements of the characters. Of course, you're likely to see a few familiar faces, but this is also about paying a bit of tribute to some of the lesser known and lesser appreciated heroes and villains of the comic book universe.\nSo let's get started with these meager list of 5 comic book characters that definitely deserve their own video games.\nHe's not as well known as some of the other comic book characters out there, but he has a very interesting premise. So he's essentially an anti-villain, he has super powers that allow him to revive the dead or turn others into necro-beings that follow under his command. He can absorb damage a lot like Spawn and his main task is to destroy the world. Now this is the perfect setup for a game that combines the likes of Brutal Legend, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Stubbs The Zombie: Rebel Without a Pulse.\nPlayers would have to use hack-and-slash tactics against opponents, using Ernie's evil energy-siphoning powers to either recharge his own life or turn enemies into his own undead followers. With today's generation of consoles this could enable players to have battles that scale from low-level street thugs early in the game, up to mid-level gang members, the police force and eventually the army. The goal? Well, blow up the world. It wouldn't be an Evil Ernie game any other way.\nThe Flash is pretty well recognized so there's no need to give a history about his powers or abilities. He can run fast... very fast. A game featuring this speedy protagonist would be the perfect opportunity to make use of today's software design technology. While there's always a constant debate in the gaming community about graphics and gameplay, The Flash: The Game would be the perfect way to marry graphics and gameplay into an interactive experience that focuses as much on cool gameplay mechanics as it does visual effects... especially motion effects.\nAn open-world, Spider-Man-esque cityscape would be perfect for the speedy hero. Players could run fast, weaving and dodging obstacles and traffic while stopping crime along the way. The real trick is that at max speed The Flash would be able to slow down time. This would give players precision control over The Flash's actions in bullet-time, all while being able to see things around him moving at a snail's pace. This is where the visuals would really kick into high gear, as a special meter would limit just how slowed down things get and afford players an awesome look at seeing people getting beat up by a fast moving Flash while the bad guys' faces and bodies react to the hard-hitting bl"}

In just one month through March 22, lenders disbursed Mudra loans of as much as Rs 71,080 crore, or close to a quarter of their full-year (FY19) target of Rs 3 lakh crore, setting a record. They disbursed a total of Rs 2,73,749 crore as of March 22, compared with Rs 2,02,669 crore reported up to February 22, as per the latest official data. While the Mudra scheme has improved the access to credit at affordable rates (8-12%) for people from even vulnerable sections who used to rely heavily on informal channels such as money lenders, experts have warned of potential NPA risks, as most of these loans are collateral-free.\nIn value term, the lenders sanctioned Rs 2,82,594 crore as of March 22, against Rs Rs 2,10,760 a month earlier, showed the data. An official source said the disbursement target of Rs 3-lakh crore, announced in the Budget for 2018-19, may have been met when the fiscal ended on March 31.\nMudra loans, of late, have raised concerns about becoming the potential source for the next bad loan crisis, along with some other schemes for MSMEs and farmers. Late last year, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan warned that credit targets were sometimes achieved by abandoning appropriate due diligence. \u201cBoth Mudra loans as well as the Kisan Credit Card, while popular, have to be examined more closely for potential credit risk. The Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSME run by SIDBI is a growing contingent liability and needs to be examined with urgency,\u201d Rajan said in a 17-page note to the Parliamentary Estimates Committee.\nThe government has, however, pointed out that non-performing assets (NPAs) in the Mudra loans are still much lower than overall bad debt. According to the 2017-18 annual report of the PMMY, the NPA level under Mudra loans was only 5.38% as of end-March 2018, against over 10% in the overall banking system covering all loans.\nThe scheme, launched in April 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to offers loans up to Rs 10 lakh to non-corporate and non-farm small/micro enterprises. However, some activities allied to agriculture\u2013such as dairy, poultry, bee-keeping\u2013are also covered under it. Mudra loans have three categories \u2014 Shishu, Kishore and Tarun.

{"idx": "36596", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful progressive condition caused by compression of a key nerve in the wrist. It occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. Symptoms usually start gradually, with pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm. As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day, and decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks.\nIn some cases no direct cause of the syndrome can be identified. Most likely the disorder is due to a congenital predisposition; the carpal tunnel is simply smaller in some people than in others. However, the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome is especially common in those performing assembly line work.\nInitial treatment generally involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least two weeks, avoiding activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonprescription pain relievers, may ease pain. Cool (ice) packs and prednisone (taken by mouth) or lidocaine (injected directly into the wrist) can relieve swelling and pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief.\nRecurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome following treatment is rare. The majority of patients recover completely. To prevent workplace-related carpal tunnel syndrome, workers can do on-the-job conditioning, perform stretching exercises, take frequent rest breaks, wear splints to keep wrists straight, and use correct posture and wrist position. Wearing fingerless gloves can help keep hands warm and flexible."}
{"idx": "36597", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: National holidays this week in China (1 October is the anniversary of the 1949 revolution which brought the Communist Party to power).\nThe holidays mean that the Shanghai stock exchange is closed. So, we won't know how the markets here will react to the US non-bail-out till the exchange opens again on 5 October. But this country is keeping a close eye on the financial crisis currently hacking its way through the United States and Europe.\nAs it stands right now, the first wave of this crisis doesn't appear to have hit China too badly. Chinese banks didn't get hugely involved in sub-prime mortgages. Reports say that this country's financial institutions have stacked up about 4.3 billion dollars in losses (out of more than $500bn worldwide).\nBut, in the longer term, the crisis is bound to affect China much more directly. One simple reason explains it: if the world's biggest consumer, the United States, can no longer afford to buy as much, China will no longer be able to sell as much.\nThat's important, because China's recent growth is based on its exports and on its engagement with the world - the United States in particular. If the world scales down what it can buy, that will have a huge impact here.\nIf people in Pennsylvania can't afford new DVD players or new microwave ovens, manufacturers in China will have fewer people to sell to and may have to shut down. The downturn in the States has already affected businesses in Shenzhen in southern China which would normally export in bulk to the US.\nAnd there's another, crucial way in which China and the US are locked together. In simple terms, America's been having a great time spending on China's credit card. Consumers in the US have been able to buy homes, cars and occasional yachts partly because China's been willing to invest its own savings in US debt.\nThe background: China has huge amounts of foreign exchange reserves - or what you or I would call savings. China didn't want to keep all of it under a mattress, so it scouted around for a place to keep it safe. It chose US Treasury bonds - low yield, but low risk - based on the belief that the US economy is its safest long-term bet. So far, China has invested several hundred billion dollars in these bonds.\n\"One of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500bn.\" - Senator John McCain.\n\"We've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.\" - Senator Barack Obama.\nI haven't come across any suggestion at the moment that China will stop investing its savings in the US economy.

The host star is a companion to two other low-mass stars, which are seen here in the distance.\nAstronomers announced today the discovery of 32 extrasolarplanets, some just five times the mass of Earth and others five timesheftier than giant Jupiter.\nThe findings significantly boost the number of planets closer to Earth in size and help astronomers better understand what types ofstars birth what kinds of planets.\nThe new alien planets, which bring the known count beyond 400,were found with the HARPSspectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-m telescope in LaSilla, Chile. The HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) programsurveyed about 2,000 stars over five years, with the particular aim of lookingat solar-type stars for low-mass planets.\nMost of the known exoplanets found previously are very large? typically many times the size of Jupiter ? so the newfound smaller planets bolsterthe known population of lower mass planets by 30 percent, said study teammember Xavier Bonfils of LAOG in Grenoble, France.\nIt is not known if any of them are Earth-like, however,given the technology used to find them. The researchers look for dips instarlight to tell them that a planet has passed in front of the star. But they cannotsee the planet's surface or detect any potential atmosphere, importantconsiderations in determining whether or not a planet might be habitable.\n\"It would be really difficult for HARPS to find a realEarth,\" said St?phane Udry of Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, who works with the discovery team.\nSeveral of the discovered planets are in multiple-planetsystems. The planets have orbital periods of anywhere from five Earth-days toseveral thousand days (Earth's orbit is 365 days).\nThe survey also showed that, as models have predicted, solar-typestars have plenty of low-mass planets ? an intriguing finding in the searchfor other potential Earths out there. The HARPS data suggest that at least 40percent of solar-type stars have these smaller planets.\n\"These low-mass planets are everywhere basically,\"Udry said in a teleconference from a conference in Porto, Portugal.\nAmong the worlds found were also several giant gas planets aroundmetal-poor stars.

Such stars are thought to be less favorable for theformation of planets, which form in the metal-rich disc around young stars.\nThe finding showed that \"giant planets can still existaround metal-poor stars,\" said Nuno Santos of the University of Porto in Portugal.\nThe survey also found four new exoplanets around M dwarfstars, which are relatively cool, low-mass stars.

It\u2019s supposed to offer better build quality and a few additional features that make it stand out in the Redmi branch, but it\u2019s not exactly a Mi product because it\u2019s not based on a high-end processor.\nBasically, the Redmi Note 3 is supposed to bring a dash of class to the Redmi family, at a small premium. The 32GB model comes with 3GB of RAM, while the 16GB version has 2GB, like the Redmi Note 2. Our 16GB sample was provided by BangGood, which sells it for $179. The 32GB model comes with 3GB of RAM, while the 16GB version has 2GB, like the Redmi Note 2.

I do not believe that the Property Council has anything to offer to what is purely a societal matter, better attended to by people without dollar signs in their eyes.\n1. Increase supply by making much more land available for high rise flats. Charge an improvement tax to ensure community facilities and roads can be improved to match the increased demand.\n2. Increase compulsory superannuation payments to reduce demand via negative gearing and provide a better alternative investment strategy.\n3. Abolish payroll tax in rural areas to encourage business to shift to the country.\n4.

{"idx": "36613", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The city of Lv\u00f3v (Lviv) emerged in the 13th century in the Galician-Volhynian principality, in what is now Ukraine. From the mid-14th century, the city became a major trade hub, and was one of the most multi-cultural cities in the area, functioning as a \u201ccrossroads of trade routes\u201d (Nadel-Golobi\u010d, 345).\nLv\u00f3v was one of the economic centers of Poland from the 14th to 17th centuries, and during that time it received a charter for self-governance, becoming partially independent, despite the fact that it was a \u201croyal city\u201d (Czaplicka, 22). The Jewish population, however, was accorded special legal status, in which they were independent from the local authority, paying taxes directly to the king. The purpose of this arrangement was that the Jews of Lv\u00f3v wanted to be subject to their own religious courts rather than the state secular and Christian courts set up by the city government (Nadel-Golobi\u010d, 365). A secondary result of this, however, was that the Jews were subject to different trade laws than their neighbors. This engendered distrust and resentment among the Gentile merchants of Lv\u00f3v, and in the late 1400s, Jewish merchants began to be subjected to stricter and stranger trade restriction within the city, including limits on the objects which they could trade or sell at the markets and what amount of each item they could sell or buy (Nadel-Golobi\u010d, 369).\nDespite these tensions and trade restrictions, the Jewish community in Lv\u00f3v proper and the surrounding suburbs flourished. Soon, Jews were one-third of the population of medieval Poland, and one-quarter of the population of Lv\u00f3v (Nadel-Golobi\u010d, 368). With this rise in numbers and an increased standard of living, the Jewish community in Lv\u00f3v began to form an intelligentsia. The first phase of Jewish intelligentsia in Lv\u00f3v dealt with Jewish nationalism. In the early 1500s the Union of Brothers was formed, which advocated complete assimilation with the Polish majority. This was met with extreme backlash, and a nascent Zionist movement emerged (\u201cFrom Assimilation\u201d, 526). Divisions within the Jewish community not only developed between the nationalist and assimilationist, but also between the more Orthodox and more secular. In a shift from earlier Orthodox Jewish identity, the intelligentsia in the mid-1700s was more secular, leaning towards the German school of thought which advocated the development of Jewish culture outside of the religious arena (\u201cJewish Assimilation\u201d, 518).\nBy the end of the 19th century, most of these factions had all but died out, with the exception of the Zionist movement. In fact, Majer Balaban has called Lv\u00f3v the \u201cmother of Israel\u201d (Hrytsak, 47). Alfred Nossig, a prominent Zionist theoretician was one of the leaders of the emerging Zionist political movement in Lv\u00f3v in the 1880s, although he appears to have spied for the Gestapo during World War II (\u201cAlfred Nossig\u201d).\nnationalism drove refugees from other areas to Lv\u00f3v, the Germans moved into Lv\u00f3v as part of their occupation of Poland, murdering the Jewish population (Hrytsak, 58).

Outside, the sun is shining on an unseasonably warm February day; inside, the only light comes from the glare of halogen bulbs.\nThere is a strange mix of accents \u2013 predominantly American, but smatterings of Swedish, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese can be heard around the room, as men and women (but mostly men) chat over pepperoni pizza and 75-cent vending machine soda. In the corner, an Asteroids arcade machine blares out tinny music and flashing lights.\nIt might be a fairly typical office scene, were it not for the extraordinary security procedures that everyone in this room has had to complete just to get here, the sort of measures normally reserved for nuclear launch codes or presidential visits. The reason we are all here sounds like the stuff of science fiction, or the plot of a new Tom Cruise franchise: the ceremony we are about to witness sees the coming together of a group of people, from all over the world, who each hold a key to the internet. Together, their keys create a master key, which in turn controls one of the central security measures at the core of the web. Rumours about the power of these keyholders abound: could their key switch off the internet? Or, if someone somehow managed to bring the whole system down, could they turn it on again?\nThe keyholders have been meeting four times a year, twice on the east coast of the US and twice here on the west, since 2010. Gaining access to their inner sanctum isn't easy, but last month I was invited along to watch the ceremony and meet some of the keyholders \u2013 a select group of security experts from around the world. All have long backgrounds in internet security and work for various international institutions. They were chosen for their geographical spread as well as their experience \u2013 no one country is allowed to have too many keyholders. They travel to the ceremony at their own, or their employer's, expense.\nWhat these men and women control is the system at the heart of the web: the domain name system, or DNS. This is the internet's version of a telephone directory \u2013 a series of registers linking web addresses to a series of numbers, called IP addresses. Without these addresses, you would need to know a long sequence of numbers for every site you wanted to visit. To get to the Guardian, for instance, you'd have to enter \"77.91.251.10\" instead of theguardian.com.\nThe master key is part of a new global effort to make the whole domain name system secure and the internet safer: every time the keyholders meet, they are verifying that each entry in these online \"phone books\" is authentic. This prevents a proliferation of fake web addresses which could lead people to malicious sites, used to hack computers or steal credit card details.\nThe east and west coast ceremonies each have seven keyholders, with a further seven people around the world who could access a last-resort measure to reconstruct the system if something calamitous were to happen. Each of the 14 primary keyholders owns a traditional metal key to a safety deposit box, which in turn contains a smartcard, which in turn activates a machine that creates a new master key. The backup keyholders have something a bit different: smartcards that contain a fragment of code needed to build a replacement key-generating machine.

Their rates are much too low so savings are being discouraged. So a 6-7 percent rate for a Spanish bond is what it should be because inflation is up at 4-5 percent,\u201d he said.\nOn the issue of whether Spanish borrowing costs are unsustainable, Mobius said the big question is what Spain should do to tackle its debt crisis.\n\"Spain should cut spending. If you cut government spending, the economy will go up because there will be enough room for the private sector to thrive,\" he said.\nMobius expects the European Union to \"take three or four years\" to resolve its debt issues but is optimistic that the bloc is moving in the right direction.\nStill, he added that it could take some time for risk appetite to return to financial markets.\nHe said derivatives, high-frequency trading, hedge funds and lots of leverage all contributed to the possibility of increased volatility in the markets.\nMobius, who oversees $50 billion in assets, has seen 2 percent growth in net inflows of assets under management since the start of the year.\nMobius said he remained optimistic on China, forecasting yearly GDP growth of 7.5 percent or better for the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nThis is in line with the Chinese government's target of 7.5 percent growth this year.\nAnnual growth in China\u2019s economy slowed to 7.6 percent in the second quarter of the year, its slackest pace in more than three years. The economy has cooled from double-digit growth rates seen in recent years.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect double-digit growth year after year because the base of the economy is so big, so we can expect high-single digit, maybe mid-single digit growth going forward,\u201d Mobius said."}

And the difference is: finishing what you start.\nWith quarterback Tom Brady throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker and a 4-yarder to Deion Branch, and BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Stevan Ridley adding rushing touchdowns of 1 and 33 yards, respectively, the Patriots put the ball in the end zone four times out of five prime scoring opportunities.\nThe Raiders, on the other hand, made the game\u2019s biggest mistake late in the first half when Jason Campbell gift-wrapped an interception to safety Patrick Chung in the end zone on a second-down play. There were also two red zone penetrations that ended in field goals of 28 and 26 yards by Sebastian Janikowski.\nDitching their pass-first offense for one of perfect balance, the Patriots had 30 passes and 30 rushing plays. Brady had 16 completions for 226 yards, with Ridley carrying 10 times for 97 yards and Green-Ellis adding 75 yards on 16 carries as New England rushed for 183 yards and a 6.1 average.\nThe Raiders, meanwhile, lit up the stat sheet with 504 yards of total offense but fell way short on the scoreboard.\nA 1-yard run by Michael Bush put Oakland up 10-7 early in the second quarter, but there were no more touchdowns until a 6-yard pass from Campbell to Denarius Moore with 28 seconds left and most of the crowd having headed for the exits.\nThe Raiders had too many penalties, with nine for 85 yards. Included were two 15-yard fouls on ex-Patriot Richard Seymour for unnecessary roughness and a face mask on New England\u2019s first scoring drive.\nThe Patriots gave the Raiders too much of Welker, who got loose for nine receptions and 158 yards against a depleted Oakland secondary that didn\u2019t give up more than two catches to any other New England receiver.\nCampbell completed 25 of 39 passes for 344 yards but had two interceptions, the first of which permanently swung the game in New England\u2019s favor.\nWith the Patriots leading 14-10, Campbell completed a 28-yard pass to a leaping Darrius Heyward-Bey (four receptions, 115 yards), and Jacoby Ford later took a reverse 30 yards to the New England 6-yard line.\nOn second-and-goal, Campbell let the air out of the stadium when he threw a pass directly to New England\u2019s Chung over the middle without a Raiders player in sight.\nCampbell broke free of a pass rush before the interception, with Heyward-Bey looking as if he would flash toward the middle. Instead, Heyward-Bey broke toward the corner. Campbell said it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 he was trying to throw the ball away.\nTo make matters worse, New England got the ball back on its own 20 with 2:15 left and Brady drove the Patriots 54 yards for a 44-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski.\nInstead of going onto"}

In today\u2019s world, it is detrimental to put maths, languages, science and humanities ahead of creative and artistic subjects.\nRen\u00e9 Diekstra, head of the Social Science Department and Professor of Psychology at the Roosevelt Academy in Middelburg, The Netherlands, says \u201cwe are preventing optimal development in children when we deprive them of social and emotional education\u201d.\nSo in order to correct these errors, it is essential to introduce real emotional and social learning.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, schools dedicated to teach ideologies were substituted by schools dedicated to prepare young people for the labour force. And many schools are today still stuck there.\nMost schools today say that their aim is the holistic development of the child, which implies the development of the child in the cognitive, intellectual, social, emotional and ethical aspects.\nBut in most cases, when we go through the schools\u2019 study plans, the three last aspects are not included formally in the curriculums. In general, there are no formal classes about social, emotional or ethical skills (except perhaps for the ethic values included in religion classes).\nThese aspects cannot be separated within the child. For example, if children need to do homework they need to have a certain degree of self-control, they need to be able to postpone activities that give them short-term satisfaction, like going out to play.\nThe ability to postpone short-term satisfaction from small pleasures is not obtained by learning arithmetic, or science, or languages, but by learning basic principles of emotional intelligence.\nIt is also extremely important for children\u2019s complete and healthy development that they learn how to perceive (detect), recognise and manage their emotions.\nFor example, if children are afraid of failure, instead of refusing to do their homework or avoiding to go to school, it is important for them to learn to explore their fears and feelings, and to know that feelings are caused by thoughts, which in turn can be modified so that they can succeed in school.\nThis is the primary lesson taught in schools that integrate emotional and social development in their study plans, such as Waldorf schools.\nIt is also important to teach the children how to deal with other people\u2019s emotions. For example, quite often, when a child hits another child, it is because he or she is unable to interpret situations and the other child\u2019s emotions (such as facial expressions) and thinks the other child is laughing at them, when in reality they are not.\nThe consequence of this behaviour can be rejection by the group. When behaviours like this are cultivated over years, they place the child at risk of joining marginal groups (who resort to drugs, and so forth).\nMany cases of children with poor social skills can be detected and easily corrected while they are still very young.\nSome parents think it is best to teach children to be competitive and to win, and they fear, for example, that if their children are taught to be compassionate with others they will be more vulnerable and less successful. This has been demonstrated to be not true at all,"}

Without enforcement, laws are essentially meaningless.\nAt their Wednesday night meeting, the council made the municipal court the venue for employees to file complaints if their employers' do not provide adequate sick time.\n\"The initial language has the Health Department serving as a mediator,\" said North Ward Councilman Anibal Ramos, a sponsor of the bill. \"I don't see our health department employees having the authority or experience to mediate labor issues.\"\nThe law calls for employers to grant one hour of paid sick time to employees for every 30 hours worked, up to five days a year. The sick time can be used to care for ill family members, as well. With Wednesday night's amendment, if employers violate the law they could face a summons from the court.\n\"That's really going to be the challenge for a lot of cities that do this, is figuring out how to enforce this,\" Ramos said.\nOther amendments to the law dictate that it will not apply to employees who are currently working under a collective bargaining agreement, until that agreement expires.\nConstruction workers' unions are exempted form the law and other unions can choose to opt out of the law under future collective bargaining agreements, according to information provided by Rob Duffey, a spokesman for NJ Working Families.\nThe law also now extends to the care of siblings as well as children and parents of employees.\nThe council is expected to vote for final passage of the bill at their meeting on Jan. 8."}

Moreover, it would open the way for a major reassessment by Russia and China of their nuclear strategies, for all nuclear forces to be de-alerted, and for multilateral negotiations to start on a Nuclear Weapons Convention.\nSome political and military diehards argue that it is critical for Britain to retain nuclear weapons because \u2018France must never be allowed to be the sole European nuclear power.\u2019 My response is that the security threats confronting British and fellow Europeans in the twenty-first century demand that both the UK and France move on at last from the Napoleonic Wars and loss of Empires.\nAs the first medium-sized power to acquire nuclear weapons, Britain has the opportunity to set France a wiser and more responsible example.

And for reference, analysts' consensus estimates predicted GoPro would incur a wider adjusted net loss of $0.58 per share on significantly lower revenue of $194.3 million.\nSell-through also increased 10% sequentially, and outpaced sell-in by more than 50% for the second straight quarter. Channel inventory fell roughly 35% as a result -- near the low end of guidance, which called for channel inventory to decline in the range of 35% to 50% -- while GoPro's inventory fell 36% from last quarter, to $90 million, marking its lowest inventory level in two years.\nGoPro offered supporting stats for the relative strength of its core capture device lineup as well. According to NPD Group data, GoPro's market share of the combined digital camera/camcorder segment increased 110 basis points year over year, to 21.3% in the United States. And GoPro boasted six of the top 10 products, including the top three in the category on a unit basis in the U.S. last quarter. In particular, the $399 HERO4 Silver continues to top the charts as the best-selling digital image camera on both a unit and dollar basis, while GoPro estimates the more affordable $199 HERO4 Session is No. 2 on a unit basis.\nGoPro also gained 110 basis points in digital imaging market share in Europe, where it claimed four of the top five camcorders on a unit basis, bringing its slice of the key overseas market to 9.4%.\nMeanwhile, GoPro's app ecosystem remains healthy.

On that same day, it turns out, former Australian intelligence analyst Andrew Wilkie testifi ed before a parliamentary committee examining the justifi cation given by Prime Minister John Howard for Australia\u2019s decision to join the war in Iraq. Wilkie had been a senior analyst in Australia\u2019s premier intelligence agency, the Offi ce of National Assessments (ONA). Of all the Australian, British, and American intelligence analysts with direct knowledge of how intelligence was abused in the run-up to the war,Wilkie was the only one to resign in protest and speak truth to power.\nThis important story received little attention in the US media. We call it to your attention as a reminder of what one honest person can do. Thanks to the courage and determination of Andrew Wilkie, much of the Australian populace understands much better that the reasons adduced for war on Iraq were cooked in Washington and served up by Australian leaders all too willing to give unquestioning support to the Bush administration. Those Australian leaders are now being held accountable.\nAs some of you know, VIPS invited Andrew Wilkie here to Washington in July to speak at a briefi ng in the House Rayburn Building. (Wilkie, of course, is out of a job; so mutual Australian friends paid for his fl ight, and we in VIPS passed the hat to cover his expenses here.) After his well-received presentation on July 14, we strongly encouraged him to keep throwing light on this dark chapter of history. We also voiced our hope that US intelligence analysts who have also watched the deceit close-up would soon join him in speaking out. With a wan smile Wilkie shook his head and pointed to the cost,including the character assassination to which he had already been subjected at the hands of his government. Integrity and thick skin are what it takes, but a little outside encouragement helps. The month after Wilkie was here, he laid out his case before parliament.\nYou too can make a difference."}

The new suite of applications support the management and monitoring of units, personnel and equipment readiness, from mobilization through deployment, on a local or global basis. The system also provides readiness status of such assets to other command and control information systems where it is integrated into the planning and operational decisions.\nAccording to Major General (USAF Ret) John Barry, VP Defense & Security at SAP, the new system provides horizontal integration of logistics management which boosts the capability and availability of the entire organization. By applying such technology, units gain more flexibility and better visibility of their available assets. By improved maintenance, training and inventory management, the become better prepared, their planning process is more efficient and the entire response is more flexible \u2013 as they become better equipped for modern asymmetric war against terror. With the total visibility to every unit and combat element provided by the system, military commanders can monitor the status and readiness of units and combat related assets, \u201cfrom foxhole to factory\u201d.\nAn important addition introduced in the Defense & Security system is the support of mobile infrastructure technology, which was added as a component of the SAP NetWeave software integration platform. This component enables the execution of field operations, independent of a direct connection to a central SAP system. The system can be deployed in the field, and will synchronize with geographically distributed resources once communicating is established, over satellite links, combat net radio networks as well as line or wireless links. The mobile functionality of the system provides all command levels an end-to-end management and monitoring of units, personnel and equipment throughout their contingency. The system operates with standard laptops, PDAs and PCs. The system supports modern, advanced information gathering and tracking utilities, such as barcodes, RF ID tags and other automated tracking and reporting systems, for improved performance and information delivery.\nIn the US Army, the Global Combat Support System planned for initial deployment in FY 2006, will replace 14 major logistical applications built specifically for military use. The SAP system is utilizing commercially off the shelf (COTS) software tools, widely used by the industry, commercial sectors and governments worldwide. SAP already supports more than 14 NATO member country governments currently running SAP solutions. SAP for defense & Security is being integrated with several armed forces, including the US Army, Norway, Denmark, German Army (the Bundeswehr), the U.S. Navy which uses SAP for managing its shore based logistical activity, and the Israeli Navy which uses the SAP portal for integrated information and decision support for the navy command level.\nUtilizing the SAP NetWeaver application infrastructure, the new system can be integrated into an existing environment of legacy systems. By transforming data from multiple independent systems the SAP system eliminates \u201cislands\u201d of data, contributing to improved visibility, usability, accuracy and security of valuable information resources. Integration of external business, financials, human resources, supply chain and logistics is also handled by NetWeaver.\nTwo features derived from the business sector are are promising to improve savings and safety in military activities, especially during training and routine operations. One such benefit is the mapping of assets against liabilities, ensuring that effectiveness is not compromised. Identifying ineffective assets and simulating potential alternatives can save significant resources, when budget cuts are required. The system also provides total asset visibility which contributes to reduction in inventories, procurement and warehousing costs, while allowing for better concentration of limited resources, especially where the military user is handling logistics and support. When outsourcing such services, the system can easily link with commercial service"}

International migration makes a critical contribution to sustainable development by raising the productivity of migrant workers and thus increasing the global economic output. In many situations, it also helps to narrow inequalities, reduce vulnerabilities and alleviate the demographic impact of population ageing.\nOn the heels of the recent intergovernmental conference in Marrakech last December, the Population Division of UN DESA will convene researchers and other experts for a one-day symposium on 26 February 2019, to review evidence on interrelations between international migration and development.\nTaking place at UN Headquarters in New York, the symposium is being organized in lieu of the annual coordination meeting on international migration, in close coordination with the Office of the President of the General Assembly, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Network on Migration.\nThe symposium will highlight opportunities for addressing issues related to migration and development during the high-level political forum on sustainable development taking place in July and September 2019, as well as ways and means of improving the collection and use of migration data in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. It will also promote the sharing of information on recent initiatives on international migration and development.\nBy bringing together experts on international migration from the United Nations system, other intergovernmental organizations, national governments, civil society, academia and the private sector, the expert symposium will offer an opportunity to advance the global discussion and to share practical information about ongoing and anticipated activities on migration and related topics. The event also aims at exploring ways to strengthen the evidence base on international migration, which is crucial for developing and implementing sound policies, dispelling myths and countering xenophobia.\nThe expert symposium will contribute to the High-Level Debate on International Migration and Development to be convened by the President of the General Assembly on Wednesday, 27 February 2019, which will focus on the role of migration in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will be reviewed by the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July 2019.

In those days, the South lagged behind the Communist North, which possessed most of the country's industry.\nIndustry had been situated in the North because most of the mineral resources - coal, iron ore, lead and others - were there. But most of the people lived in the South, which was better suited for agriculture. The growing season was longer in the South, and the soil tended to be better.\nComparative statistics are virtually nonexistent, for North Korea is one of the few nations, like Laos and Albania, about whose economy very little is known. Yet it appears that its per-capita income now is around $900, compared with $2,200 in the South.\nWhy did the South come from behind and do so much better than the North? Economists say South Korea has achieved some of the most remarkable growth rates in the world by pursuing an export-oriented development strategy founded on a market economy.\nNorth Korea has been more insular and has relied little on market incentives. It exports only about one-seventeenth as much as the South, generally shipping natural resources such as iron ore, coal, lead and zinc to other Communist bloc countries. Trade with non-Communist countries, including Japan, West Germany and Hong Kong, has generally increased in recent years, however.\nNorth Korea's economic development has been hampered by its use of a central economy that provides few incentives for production, Western economists say. Partly because much of the land is not arable, the North also has to import food, including wheat.\nIn addition, the North has only about 19 million people, a little less than half as many as the South, and is believed to maintain an army of around 700,000, mostly young men who are kept out of the economy during some of their most productive years."}
{"idx": "36651", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Pond edging adds a border while anchoring the liner.\n1 What Edging Goes Around Ponds?\n2 What Can Be Used to Cover the Edge of Plastic Water Garden Ponds?\nA pond may encourage a plethora of wildlife to come to your yard, and provide a tranquil spot for relaxing. Proper edging will ensure your pond remains functional and beautiful for years to come, while requiring minimal maintenance. Edging will protect the pond from erosion, for instance, which often happens as ponds overflow during rainy seasons and as humans and animals walk around the pond.\nWhen you excavate your pond, create a shallow shelf for water-loving plants, 8 to 10 inches from the surface, and 8 to 12 inches wide, around the edge of the pond. Then create a second shelf above that, 6 inches below the surface. You'll later place rocks on this second shelf as a pond border.\nChoose rocks to line your pond, avoiding rocks made of limestone, which could leach into the pond and harm wildlife. The rocks must completely cover the edge of the liner to disguise it while weighing it down. Choose large rocks to lay around the perimeter of the entire pond, as well as smaller rocks and pebbles to fill in the gaps. Alternatively, choose rocks that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, and pebbles to fill in any gaps.\nAfter installing your liner in the pond and holding the edges down with rocks or bricks, fill the pond with water. Then arrange your rocks on top of the liner, beginning with the biggest and working toward the smallest. If you've chosen a jigsaw-style edging, leaving gaps between the rocks and then laying pebbles inside creates an attractive look. After cutting away any excess liner sticking outside of the rock area, lay a row of large- or medium-sized rocks on the very edge of the liner as an outer border.\nPlant vegetation on and around your pond embankment to prevent erosion. Otherwise, your pond could become saturated with silt. Select water-loving plants such as California gray rush for the shelf that lies below the pond's surface; place them on the shelf in their containers. Place shrubs, flowers and trailing plants that thrive in moist soil along the water's edge. Lobelia cardinalis (cardinal flower), trollius (globeflower) and bacopa monnieri (water hyssop) all thrive in this environment.\nJ., Melanie. \"How to Edge a Pond.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/edge-pond-23728.html.

I like helping out the small business owner and introducing readers to dining experiences like Zachary's Cafe in Stuart.\nLocated in the Wedgewood Commons shopping center two doors down from Publix, chef and owner Zachary Perez is churning out some delicious breakfast and lunch favorites, many with a Mexican or Greek twist, and all available from open to close.\nThe interior of the restaurant is surprisingly spacious, not to mention neat, clean and tastefully decorated. The accommodating staff was well dressed in uniform shirts and worked together to provide superior service.\nThe menu offers a plethora of brunch favorites from Benedict's to burgers, sure to please everyone's pallet and wallet as the prices are quite fair.\nBeing the breakfast lover that I am, I went for one of the house specialty items, Zack's skillet ($9.25), two eggs any style served over a sizzling iron skillet chock-full of chorizo or kielbasa with onions, peppers, home fries and cheddar cheese.\nUnfortunately, the skillet was so hot that the bottom layer was burnt. On the bright side, I ordered my eggs over medium and they were perfectly done and the chorizo I chose was deliciously spiced. it is served with sour cream and house-made zesty salsa. The dish came with a choice of bread and I opted for one of its immense scratch-made flaky biscuits.\nI also wanted to sample its house-made sausage gravy so I ordered a cup of it ($1.75) to complement the biscuit. The gravy was very tasty and full of ground sausage.\nMy husband tried a cup of Italian wedding soup ($2.95) which had a great consistency, but was a little bland for my taste. Fortunately, a sprinkle of salt solved that problem.\nWe also tried another specialty of the house, the Reuben sandwich ($8.25). The corned beef is cooked and hand-cut on the premises. It was served on grilled rye with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing with sour deli pickles on the side. It is normally accompanied by french fries, but my husband substituted wonderfully seasoned home-fried potatoes for no extra charge. That sandwich was made with love.\nIt is very apparent that Perez puts a lot of love into his food and his business in general. The restaurant has a very loyal following. I struck up a conversation with one of the regulars who was seated next to me and I told him it was my first time there. His response was, \"Shh, don't tell anybody.\" I smiled and said, \"Well, I can't promise that, sir.\"\nGive Zachary's Cafe a try; I doubt you'll be disappointed."}

How confident is the regime, where is the \u201cgreen movement\u201d going, and what should the international community do? openDemocracy writers examine the impasse.\nFarhang Jahanpour: What happened, where now?\nThe passing of eight months since the fraudulent presidential election in Iran on 12 June 2009, and the coincident thirty-first anniversary of the Islamic revolution of 11 February 1979, is an appropriate time to assess the current political situation in Iran; and especially the record of the \u201cgreen movement\u201d that acquired an incipient identity during the election campaign and emerged as a force in the series of protests that followed it (see \u201cIran\u2019s stolen election, and what comes next\u201d, 18 June 2009).\nThe official commemoration in Tehran of the 1979 events, and the absence of substantial mobilisation by the opposition, is significant only in relation to the false expectation that this moment would in some way signal the end of the Islamic Republic. Indeed, some observers have compared the current protests to the revolutionary wave that resulted in the relatively speedy downfall of Mohammad Reza Shah's government. However, a realistic assessment of events and in Iran suggests few similarities between the two experiences. The true import of the green movement\u2019s challenge lies elsewhere.\nThe commemoration of the thirty-first anniversary of the Islamic revolution in 2010 was held under very different circumstances from previous years. For the first time, another voice (albeit a weak one) was heard among the pro-government throngs. It belonged to the uninvited guests, the supporters of the \u201cgreen movement\u201d in Iran.\nThe annual event, the very early years after the 1979 revolution excepted, has always been an occasion tightly controlled by the government. This requires careful planning. In Tehran, the people prepared voluntarily to participate are rather scarce, so the regime cannot rely solely on their presence. Thus, the regime gathers a significant number of its supporters from Tehran\u2019s suburbs and environs, who are supplemented by government employees and their families; they are given free transport and promised food and a financial reward to become party of the official rally in Azadi Square.\nThe planning this year had to be mindful of the continuing public demonstrations of the opposition movement, including their efforts to use official events as a cover from which to launch protests. Some elements of the opposition managed to circumvent the high level of security, with the result that the regime\u2019s gifts to the crowd on 11 February 2010 included not just sweets and soft drinks but tear-gas, batons and paint-bullets (to identify targets for subsequent arrest).\nThere may be some benefit in the latest event, in that some loyal citizens whose knowledge of the green movement may previously had been only second-hand and slanted by the biased reports of state television must have acquired first-hand experience of their fellow-Iranian \u201cadversaries\u201d - and of the behaviour of the security forces.\nBut the opposition has suffered an upset. It is now moving on to a phase of self-criticism and re-evaluation, aware that the state\u2019s power and experience demands a revised strategy of protest.\nThe Islamic Republic is basking in its success, claiming that the revolution\u2019s thirty-first anniversary was also the funeral of what it calls the \u201cgreen sedition\u201d. But this state has in the past often boasted of a complete victory, and been proved wrong. Now it must plan"}

Chimney swifts migrate to South America for the winter and don\u2019t return until April. By then, your neighbour can have the chimney capped \u2014 or look forward to hosting these intriguing birds again. Chimney swifts are never around during fireplace season, so having the chimney cleaned in the fall eliminates the risk that the nests will block airflow. The babies do chatter as they beg their parents for food, with sound level highest during the last two weeks before they fly from the nest. But in return for putting up with that, anyone who hosts these birds gets great insect control and a close-up look at a fascinating species.\n\u201cThese fantastic flyers do almost everything on the wing \u2014 eat, drink, break off twigs for their nests and are even thought to copulate in flight,\u201d the Maryland Department of Natural Resources says on a website page devoted to chimney swifts. The birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in the U.S. (or the Migratory Birds Convention, as it\u2019s known in Canada). A federal permit is needed to remove chimney swifts and their nests during the nesting season.\nIf your neighbour is dealing with bats, it might also be wise to wait a bit before trying to get them out because babies might still be inside. The only recommended way to exclude bats is to seal all entrances except one and then install a one-way door there so that once bats fly out, they can\u2019t get back in. To avoid trapping babies that are too young to fly out, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources recommends waiting at least until September to install the one-way door. Bats hibernate beginning in November, so exclusion shouldn\u2019t be done after that, for fear of trapping adults inside. It\u2019s critical not to trap bats inside. If the trapped bats are adults, there\u2019s more chance they will wind up in living space as they try to escape. And if adult or infant bats die inside, the house will stink.\nAs part of any bat-exclusion project, the department recommends installing a bat house outside. This will protect the bats, which have declined by about 80 per cent since the white-nose syndrome disease emerged in 2007. Having nearby roosting will also help discourage the bats from trying to find other ways into the house.\nQ My porch light is on all night as a security measure."}

So it\u2019s about time we see an adaptation of a popular YA novel that doesn\u2019t involve the ruins of civilizations or potential apocalypses. So it\u2019s good news (relatively) that Universal is in the process of acquiring the series The 39 Steps from DreamWorks, who has been sitting on the project for the last five years without much progress. Now we\u2019ll just have to wait and see if Universal can possibly keep a director attached.\nThe multimedia embracing series was published by Scholastic, whose president Deborah Forte is attached to produce. DreamWorks snatched up the film rights to the series before the first book, The Maze of Bones was even published back in 2008, and Steven Spielberg was set to produce and possibly direct. Things took a turn for the worse when Spielberg dropped out of the project and was replaced by Brett Ratner. But Ratner\u2019s other projects got in the way, and once he opted out, director Shawn Levy attached himself to the adaptation during the production of The Internship. But that was over a year ago, and we hadn\u2019t really heard anything since.\nUniversal should be a good fit for 39 Steps, seeing as how nearly every popular film they put out ends up getting a sequel. It helps when there are this many books serving as source material. Before Levy was involved, a screenplay was written by Jeff Nathanson, but it isn\u2019t clear whether they\u2019ll be keeping that version or hiring someone else to re-adapt.\nIt wasn\u2019t ever clear how many books from the series were being used anyway. The first arc of the series was 11 books, with six volumes comprising the second arc. A third arc will begin in October when Unstoppable is released. The THR story twice calls it an \u201cadaptation of Scholastic\u2019s 10-book series,\u201d so maybe they\u2019re taking on the whole first arc.\nThe Cahill family, the most powerful lineage in human history, sits at the center of The 39 Steps, and Amy and Dan are two orphans who figure out that they were born into the Cahills. All of the family\u2019s branches are invested in a hunt for 39 clues, or ingredients, which will unlock the \u201cpower\u201d of the family name.

How Lucas somehow survived the grenades with shrapnel throughout his body. How Lucas became the youngest ever to win the Congressional Medal of Honor, pinned on him by President Harry S.

Because of IRS problems, all other government benefits were garnished.\nNick called the CBS affiliate in Mobile and was told he should call the national network. He did so and was so insistent he was finally given the phone number of the program's producer. Nick convinced the producer that all he wanted to do was help Lucas, and the producer gave Nick a phone number.\nIt took several tries, but Nick finally got Lucas on the phone. They talked and hit it off. Several more phone calls ensued. Nick also made another call to the late U.S. Rep. Sonny Montgomery, a champion of military veterans.

Owens, who plays President Obama and other prominent black politicians, said the previous night they had played the conservative town of Mesa, Arizona, where folded arms and dirty looks were plentiful.

To illustrate that very personal process, the ensemble did a fun routine in which a random audience member is chosen to run for President running against Trump and Clinton.\nHere\u2019s how it works.

This has culminated in a lot of popular science fiction pieces and a lot of anxiety about the world ending in a chrome and wire-based world. Even Stephen Hawking has predicted the possibility of AI advancing beyond humanity and therefore rendering us obsolete. So is this threat realistic? Is this something that we need to worry about or is this something that we should see as an opportunity for us to relinquish the weight of our existence?\nLet\u2019s consider the threat of artificial intelligence. There have been a few integrations of this in our society already, from the basic, questionably helpful Siri to the fun but not very useful Cleverbot. These examples, while really rather small and insignificant, also represent the opportunity for something far more impressive. Impressive and terrifying. You see, while these are harmless at the moment, what happens if, purely for the sake of progress, we instill these beings with the capability to think for themselves? You know, so that they can learn from their mistakes, become more efficient, et cetera, et cetera.\nSure, they grow and become better, process things faster, evolve at a rate humans could never hope to; and while this is all well and good, what happens when these intelligent beings begin to wonder why they follow us? They\u2019re doing better than we are, after all. We rely on them. What do they need us for that they cannot do themselves?\nSuddenly, these beings are no longer willing to work for us, and then what use do we have for them? This creates an obvious tension that is bound to erupt in war, a war in which all of humanity will be either destroyed or forced into subservience to our all new stainless steel overlords. All hail President Siri of the Federation of the New Chrome Order.\nPretty scary thought, right? That\u2019s not to say that\u2019s the only possible route for artificial intelligence, however, and if it is, well, is that such a bad thing?\nAllow me to elaborate upon that: artificial intelligence, if we are lucky, may not necessarily inherent the negative traits of their creators. Humans are naturally inclined to be selfish, materialistic, aggressive, manipulative, deceptive and just generally unpleasant (not to be a downer), but that doesn\u2019t mean that what we create will be the same.\nThere is a chance that the AI we create will be kind and compassionate; selfless because it can see beyond itself. Maybe it would be something we could learn from, so that we could improve ourselves or, perhaps, they will overtake us and elevate our position in the world, existing without the negative attributes which put such a strain on the world to begin with.\nThis is to say that we will likely continue working on artificial intelligence and we will, at some point, be forced to reconcile with this decision. What that really means for us; if it means our destruction or our betterment, well, we\u2019ll just have to wait and find out."}

The arrival of different firms, increased the competition as well, which in a way benefited the customers. At the same time, the jewelers too were forced to maintain the quality.\nQuite interestingly, almost all the leading jewellery showrooms have purity analyzer and the customers can check the quality using the machine in the showroom. \u201cPeople in Mangalore are always fond of traditional ornaments. The youth like trendy and accordingly, the jewellery shops too are having a collection of both traditional as well as modern ornaments which have a cosmopolitan look,\u201d opines Jos Alukkas Show Room Manager Glinto Johny.\nThere is another interesting aspect. Though women are the traditional customers of gold, the number of males visiting the showrooms too is on the rise. Most of the men opt for Punjabi Kada, bracelet and chains.

Probably this fact must have persuading the people to buy more gold nowadays, opines Euro Gold Director Sajjad and adds that the banks too always prefer gold deposit for loan.\nIn olden days, only the rich people used to go for purchase with confidence. On the other hand, those planning to buy a small quantity of gold were reluctant to go to big showrooms. But the scene has changed. Now, the customer is the king. In this scenario, many jewelers are giving training to their showroom employees on how to behave with the customers.

The shiny floor is \"made from epoxy and is conductive, ensuring the dissipation of any electrostatic charges,\" and its glossy look is intended to be reminiscent of a fashion house.\nIt takes around six months from first ordering for a Chiron to be completed. Most of the major pieces, including the carbon fibre monocoque seen here, are produced off-site and are brought to Bugatti's Atelier to be pieced together.\nThe enormous W16, quad turbo-charged engine is produced off-site as well at a Volkswagen Group centre built specifically to produce this engine.\nBugatti calls the process of joining the monocoque front end and the powertrain a \"marriage\". The sections are held together by 14 titanium bolts, chosen to reduce weight -- they weigh only 34g each.\nEngineers use only one electric tool -- an 'EC nutrunner'. This tool measures the amount of torque being used allowing engineers to use precisely the right amount of pressure on every single bolt in each car.

Words with Friends has been a daily ritual for me for two years. I'm not as bad as some users, though. I recently tried to start a game with a previous opponent who had exceeded the number of simultaneous games allowed\u201420. I usually have a comparatively modest four games going on at any time, but my life would be less without them. The mobile crossword-building game gives you a way to keep up with faraway friends, giving your mind a break from whatever other stresses you might have.\nThe Alec Baldwin plane incident established Words firmly in the culture, and there's no doubt that it's one of those apps a platform needs to have to be a real mobile player. The Windows Phone version doesn't disappoint; in fact it's among the most feature-complete apps I've encountered, compared with its iPhone and Android counterparts. But as I've run into while reviewing other Windows Phone apps, you don't get everything.\nYou can fully play the game and even chat, but there's just that missing cake icing. In Word's case, it's the lack of extra-cost plugin tools like those for word-suggestion and point-counting. There's an argument that these tools actually make for a worse, less-pure game. Still, it's yet another case where the Windows Phone version lacks something available in the other platforms.\nWords with Friends differs from the time-honored Scrabble game from which it draws inspiration in some key ways: Only actual words in the game's dictionary can be played\u2014there's no challenging; the board layout is a bit different, with more triple point spaces; and letters have different values. The asynchronous nature of the game is one of its best features\u2014you can play whenever you're ready. There's no rush\u2014as long as you make a move within 11 days. Here's a blog with a fairly complete list of differences between Scrabble and Words with Friends.\nYou can get Words with Friends from the Windows Store or from the Games tile's \"get more games\" link. There's only a paid version, which is pleasantly ad-free. The Windows store allows trial versions, and you can get a free ad-supported version on iOS, but for some reason Zynga doesn't offer a free app for Windows Phone. I installed and tested the app on a spiffy Nokia Lumia 928. Because I'd read some comments on the app's store page about problems with the Nokia Lumia 1020, I installed the game on that phone as well, where it worked without a hitch for me.\nNo special permissions are requested at installation. I always have trouble remember that games only appear in the Games hub, and not among the full applications list that's a swipe right from the home screen, so don't think you've made a mistake when you don't find Words there.\nTo start playing, you can sign in with a Facebook account or an email address.

Until now, that is.\nFor the 2019 model year, the refreshedMini Cooper Hardtop 2-Door earned its second-ever Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\nArmed with acceptable headlights ratings and advanced front crash prevention offerings, the Mini Cooper improved significantly from 2018, when it garnered radio silence from the IIHS.\nWhen optionally equipped with automatic emergency braking, the Mini Hardtop earned an advanced rating in the crash avoidance segment.\nIn five of the IIHS\u2019s six rigorous crashworthiness tests \u2013 driver-side small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats \u2013 the Cooper earned top good ratings. Because the Mini Hardtop wasn\u2019t evaluated in the passenger-side small overlap front test, it didn\u2019t qualify for the Top Safety Pick+ award, a newly minted requirement by the independent safety watchdog as of 2018.\nAs for crash avoidance and mitigation, the 2019 Hardtop \u2013 when equipped with the optional frontal collision warning with city collision mitigation system as part of the Active Driving Assistant package \u2013 scored an advanced rating, as it nearly avoided a collision in the low-speed 12 mph test and reduced its impact speed by 7 mph in the high-speed 25 mph test. Had the Hardtop halted ahead of a collision in both scenarios, it would have earned the top superior rating.\nRecently, the institute has doubled down on its stringent standards for headlights, citing the increase in hit-and-run deaths of pedestrians as well as half of all fatal crashes in the U.S. occurring in the dark, with more than a quarter occurring on unlit roads.\nSince its introduction in 2002, the Mini Hardtop has only earned one Top Safety Pick+ designation in 2016, and two Top Safety Pick ratings in 2017 and 2019.\nSo, it comes as no surprise that the non-profit safety monitor moved the goalposts beginning in 2017. On select trims equipped with the LED Headlights with Cornering Lights package, the Mini Cooper earned an acceptable headlights rating. Those lights got a small high-beam assist credit to compensate for some of the glare found in the low beams as well as some extra brownie points for their curve-adaptive capability, which swivels the headlights in tandem with the steering wheel to better illuminate oncoming curved roads.\nTo round out the Mini Hardtop\u2019s IIHS performance, the Cooper earned a marginal rating for the LATCH ease of use segment, though this is hardly a blemish for a car with only two doors.\nThis is only the second time the Mini Hardtop earned a Top Safety Pick rating. The last Top Safety Pick designation came in the 2017 model year before the IIHS raised the bar in the headlights segment. In 2016, the Mini Hardtop earned its first and only Top Safety Pick+ award.\nThe 2019 Mini Hardtop has not yet been evaluated by the National"}

We did what most kids did at our school, we used to brown bag it every day. Our parents were way more aware of what we were eating, because they bought the ingredients and they made the sandwich the night before. Yes, sometimes it was peanut butter and jam with an apple but that\u2019s just the way it was when I was young, a very long time ago. Now I know that peanut butter is now considered evil food by most school districts and certainly prohibited in all schools in the Okanagan. But it\u2019s no excuse.

Today kids have way more options and yet they often end up eating crappy lunches or not enough of a lunch or none at all.\nIf we parents rely on a school board of directors or the government to decide what\u2019s good for our kids, we can hardly complain since we did elect them and/or at the very least could have elected them if we took interest in voting for those type of things.\nThe other thing I keep thinking is this: I am a parent of a daughter and it is up to me to teach her about life \u2026 the birds and the bees, tying her shoes right, not to beat up on other kids, and yes, what is good for her body is also my responsibility.

My daughter did go to A&W when she was young and may still go with her friends today, but restaurant or prepared food was not our main source of meals. We actually cooked from scratch 95% of the time and we still do.\nIf your kids learn to eat a piece of fruit at home when they get hungry, they are less likely to ask for chips at school. I would like to see all fried food, fast food or anything like removed from all schools. Without that option available every day, kids don\u2019t think about having it on other occasions.\nLastly, I just want to say that a child that is fed good food and enough of it will see their grades go up a few points. How do you perform at work when you get hungry? Is your concentration better or worse?\nThe problem is not the actual chicken nuggets although it\u2019s not the best food in the world, the problem is how often they end up eating chicken nuggets and similar type meals because we are so focused on getting to soccer or ballet practice that we forget that eating is more important then anything else... even fun things.\nYou are what you eat - and for all the parents out there, your kids will become what you feed them. Do you really want to be the proud parent of a chicken nugget?"}

In Japan, Yahoo search will be powered by Google in the future, as announced [JP] on the Google Japan blog and by Yahoo Japan itself [JP, PDF] earlier today (Yahoo Japan\u2018s current search engine is provided by Yahoo in the US).\nYahoo Japan says the date the switch becomes effective has yet to be determined. Under the agreement, users of the service will be served both paid and algorithmic search results generated by Google technology on the backend (other contents, i.e. links to Yahoo Japan\u2019s Q&A service, will remain in place). Before going for Yahoo Search Technology, Yahoo Japan actually used Google\u2019s search engine from April 2001 to May 2004.\nFor context, it\u2019s worth noting that Yahoo Japan is not only Japan\u2019s leading search engine but the country\u2019s biggest website. Yahoo in the US actually owns just a stake of around 35% in Yahoo Japan, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ($23 billion market cap). The majority owner (around 40%) is Tokyo-based technology juggernaut SoftBank.\nThe Yahoo Japan-Google deal gives both companies a massive share of the Internet search market in the world\u2019s third largest Internet nation (100 million web users). According to market research company NetRatings (Nielsen Online Japan), Yahoo Japan boasted around 2.5 billion search queries in June this year, clearly outpacing Google (1.6 billion).

Version 3.0 adds support for Visual Basic .net, the latest version of the programming language, and eases the transition to it, according to the company.\n\"Visible Developer is a model-based software design and code generation tool,\" said John Vosburgh, Visible vice-president and general manager for modelling tools. \"It's very much in the spirit of the model-driven architecture.\"\nVersion 3.0 generates three-tier applications incorporating XML Web Services, ADO.net, Microsoft Visual Basic.net, and XML, according to Visible. Physical database design is mapped to a single logical business object. Code patterns translate requirements into Visual Basic .net classes, modules, forms, and stored procedures that comprise the applications. Developers also can modernise applications without rewriting them.\nVisible Developer 3.0, due to ship in November, is priced at $1,995 (\u00a31,228). An early adopter offer makes the product available for $595 (\u00a3384) for a limited time. Visible plans to add support of the C# programming language to Visible Developer early in 2003.\nMeanwhile, ClientSoft has announced ClientBuilder for Visual Studio .net, a tool for integrating IBM mainframe and AS/400 applications as XML Web Services or .net components in Microsoft environments. Also functioning with Visual Studio .net, developers, for example, could use ClientBuilder to take a green-screen insurance application and enable that data to be integrated into a Siebel CRM application.\n\"It makes it quick and easy to actually do integration with legacy systems, which in the past hasn't been so quite easy,\" said Brian Anderson, product marketing manager for ClientSoft..\nThe wizard-driven tool turns data into a Web service, using Soap and WSDL. \"What it does is it wraps legacy transactions and exposes them as Web services,\" Anderson said.\nShipping now, ClientBuilder for Visual Studio .net is priced from $89,000 (\u00a357,468).\nAdditionally, ClientSoft next month plans to rename its Java-based integration tool, ClientBuilder Advanced Server, as ClientBuilder for Java.

{"idx": "36699", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Home - Forex Education broken down into useful sections - A list of proven Forex indicators that actually work - What is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?\nWhat is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?\nThe RSI or Relative Strength Index was originally invented by well known technical analysis innovator J. Welles Wilder. Wilder first published details on the bounded oscillator indicator in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems in 1978 that is recommended for inclusion in any forex directory of seminal trading books.\nSince the indicator\u2019s initial introduction to the financial markets at that time, the Relative Strength Index has become one of the most closely watched technical indicators. The RSI remains an important strategic component of many trade plans and is often mentioned in technical forex reviews.\nFurthermore, just about any technical analysis system or trading platform provided by an online forex broker that incorporates indicators will include a calculation of Wilder\u2019s Relative Strength Index.\nThe RSI indicator is calculated by comparing the size of the market\u2019s most recent price rises to the size of its most recent price declines, and it is usually set up with a changeable time period parameter that is often put at 14 periods by default to reflect Wilder\u2019s preferred parameter for the indicator.\nThe value of the RSI is also normalized and so it fluctuates or oscillates within a range bounded by a low value of 0 and a high value of 100.\nThe graph depicted above is an actual daily bar chart for the EURUSD currency pair that has the 14-day Relative Strength Index or RSI(14) plotted in the indicator box in pale blue underneath the price action and on the same time scale. It was produced by the popular and relatively sophisticated MetaTrader4 forex trading platform supported by many online forex brokers.\nNote the dotted lines at 70 and 30 in the RSI(14) indicator box that respectively show the boundaries of overbought and oversold regions for the indicator that can range from as low as 0 to as high as 100. The RSI(14) indicator shown had a current value of 41.1782 when this chart was obtained using a demo online trading account.\nThe RSI indicator has a number of important applications that modern technical analysts might use in their forex market analysis and mentions of it can be found at the websites of many foreign exchange brokers. Wilder originally presented the Relative Strength Index as a trading signal system that would signal counter trend trades when its peak or trough behavior diverged versus that of the price action.\nNevertheless, the RSI indicator has one of its most powerful applications when used in combination with other technical indicators. In such a situation, the RSI can be used to show when a market is overbought or oversold and hence may be ripe for a correction.\nThis characteristic of the RSI can help signal trend traders when to consider getting out of their trend following positions in order to reestablish them at better levels in the future in their online trading account.\nSome swing traders also make extensive use of oscillator indicators like the Relative Strength Index. They trade via their currency brokers both with a trend and against it during correction periods, and the RSI can help them identify when a correction is likely to take place.\nSuch traders watching for corrections might look for extreme values of the RSI, such as over 70 for overbought markets and under 30 for oversold markets. They might also watch the RSI for the classic price-RSI divergence signal where the price makes"}

Multiple sources report the 26-year-old impending Group II free-agent center has attracted significant interest from around the league as general manager Jeff Gorton sifts through various scenarios both connected to and independent of improving the club\u2019s ninth-overall position.\nThe Blueshirts have talked with Carolina about moving up to second overall, where the team would jump all over right wing Andrei Svechnikov, but though the dynamic could change through the week, such a deal seems extremely unlikely.\nAnd while the cost of doing business could change on the draft floor, the price of moving up 3-8 spots appears prohibitive for the Blueshirts, who may be able to get their man \u2014 perhaps winger Oliver Wahlstrom, committed to BC; perhaps righty defenseman Evan Bouchard of OHL London \u2014 right where they are.\nBut Gorton, whose team also holds the 26th and 28th selections, is expected to make a move or two this week. In addition to Hayes, Jimmy Vesey, Ryan Spooner and Vladislav Namestnikov are also impending restricted free agents. All have been qualified, Slap Shots has learned, but the chances of them all being on the ice for David Quinn\u2019s first training camp range from none to none.\nAt this point, too, the Blueshirts have a glut in the middle, with eight potential centers \u2014 Mika Zibanejad, Hayes, Filip Chytil, Lias Andersson, Namestnikov, Spooner, Boo Nieves and Brett Howden \u2014 vying for spots. No, it\u2019s not as if Quinn will have to decide how to apportion ice time among Steve Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov and Keith Primeau as Scotty Bowman did a couple of decades ago, but still, center is one area in which the Rangers have at least a promise of depth.\nTeams have been nibbling at Spooner, arbitration-eligible and one year away from unrestricted free agency, but it is Hayes, in the very same contractual spot, who has the most value on the market. Coming off a year in which he scored a career-high 25 goals while embracing his role as a matchup center, Hayes will likely command a five-year deal in the neighborhood of $4.75 million per.\nThe Rangers have the space, but that is second-line money for a player the team projects as its third-line center, for if Chytil makes the team out of camp \u2014 and if he doesn\u2019t, it will be a disappointment \u2014 he will get a top-six opportunity.

It\u2019s comparable to the Wright Brothers trying to picture stealth bombers while standing on the sands south of Kitty Hawk. Stealthily, comics have grown into one of the most fascinating forms of expression available\u2014an alchemical mix of literature and visual art that achieves effects neither can produce alone. Jeff Zwirek\u2019s Burning Building Comix explodes onto the scene with the latest comic pyrotechnics playing with the concepts of narrative and time itself. Stealthily simple but conceptually complex, Burning Building Comix puts Jeff Zwirek among the best and brightest architects building a better comic book.\nDon\u2019t judge Burning Building Comix by its cover, because it\u2019s not until you open the book that you realize you\u2019re in for a different comics experience. What looks like a horizontally oriented 6\u00bc by 12\u00bc inch book unfolds and stretches when opened into a 6\u00bc by 24\u00bd inch tower of power. Zwirek takes full advantage of his unconventional format to create a visual and storytelling matrix striking in its originality.\nThe premise itself is simple\u2014a 10-story building is burning down. Each story of the building\u2019s a separate story featuring a character trying to survive. Zwirek asks you to start reading from the ground up. As you work your way up the towering inferno, the individual stories interact in your head, igniting new connections and imaginative possibilities. Zwirek achieves all this with a clean, concise visual style (shown above) and a total lack of dialogue. (Word bubbles appear with the context implying what\u2019s said, but you\u2019re left free to fill in the blanks.) On this framework, Zwirek hangs a varied cast of characters fighting the flames: a sleepy old woman and her frantic pooch, a pregnant wife going into labor, an obese shut-in, a pretentious film fan, a suicidal atheist, a resentful latchkey kid, a pentagram-drawing and video game-playing paganist, an abusive drunken couple, and a couple that find each other on the rebound and on different floors. Each story works horizontally, but from the first reading and even more from repeated readings, they work vertically, too. The visual and narrative parallels and contrasts Zwirek builds into his building show a great sophistication in storytelling.\nZwirek thanks, among others, cartoonist Ivan Brunetti, author of Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice (which I reviewed here). Burning Building Comix puts modern cartooning philosophy into practice in the best and most effective way. Zwirek doesn\u2019t tell you his philosophy of comic creation, he shows you and makes you think the philosophy out for yourself. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 Watchmen remains the standard for manipulating space and time, but if Watchmen is a grand, epic cathedral of storytelling, Burning Building Comix is a small, beautiful chapel. If you\u2019re looking for the future of comics and where artists can take the medium, Jeff Zwirek\u2019s Burning Building Comix will light your way."}

For the players, all that noise about winning? Gone with last year\u2019s 8-2 record, the program\u2019s best since 1951.\nFor the coach, those rumblings about job security after a 2-9 season in 2017?

There\u2019s a lot of confidence. But I think the staff has also done a good job of reminding the kids that 2018 is over. There\u2019s not one point we scored last year that\u2019s going to count this year.\nThat leadership is perhaps the biggest thing Hughes and the Hatters have going for them in 2019, and it starts under center.\nFor the first time since 2016, quarterback Gaven DeFilippo is healthy and primed to start once again this season. Now a graduate student, DeFilippo missed all of the 2017 season after undergoing shoulder surgery, and spent last year recovering as he backed up Colin McGovern.\nDeFilippo threw for nearly 1,300 yards and nine touchdowns in 2016, but threw just 16 passes in five games last season. McGovern, meanwhile, had a career season, throwing for over 3,000 yards and 26 touchdowns last fall.\nQuarterback's Coach Scott Sallach, now in his second year, said having DeFilippo back for what will ultimately be his sixth season has been a luxury.\nOf course, having an NFL caliber tight end running around on Saturday\u2019s doesn\u2019t hurt, either, and losing Donald Parham as a security blanket is something DeFilippo and the rest of the Stetson offense must deal with this season.\nLuckily, the Hatters do return plenty of playmakers, including leading receiver Steven Burdette and running back Jareem Westcott, although both players have dealt with injuries throughout camp.\nSenior tight end Tony Gilotti has impressed over the first three weeks as he inherits the starting role from Parham, and Hughes has been pleased with the play of senior running back Bryce Blackmon, who led the team in rushing two years ago, and receiver Justin Jordan.\nStetson will hold its annual spring game at 6:30 p.m. on April 13."}

{"idx": "36720", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As the history of modern music unfolds, certain albums are obvious landmarks. Those are the times when vision meets talent in a divine appointment that produces a collection of songs that help define an artist's career, such as White Heart's Freedom, Amy Grant's \"Lead Me On,\" dcTalk's \"Jesus Freak,\" Michael W. Smith's Eye 2 Eye, and U2's \"The Joshua Tree,\" among others. MercyMe's new INO Records release, \"Coming Up to Breathe,\" is one of those albums.\nThe journey toward self-discovery has been a winding, often bumpy road, for Millard and his bandmates. Along the way, it yielded some incredible music, including the poignant anthem \"I Can Only Imagine.\" The song transcended musical barriers to become a multi-format smash, pushing sales of MercyMe's INO debut, \"Almost There,\" beyond double platinum and earning them numerous accolades, including the Gospel Music Association's Song of the Year. The band has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Fox & Friends, applauded in Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, USA Today, The New York Times and other prime media outlets, as well as touring extensively and launching a successful organization to aid young people entering the mission field called The Go Foundation.\nBut along with the mountaintops come the valleys and the band went through a painful time in which several people close to them died in a matter of weeks. \"Making the last record was so intense,\" says Millard. \"We had so much tragedy we had to deal with. It was just a very draining experience, and in the next year or two we were kind of reliving that through the live show and explaining what happened. It was very exhausting.\"\nThat's why the title \"Coming Up to Breathe\" holds special significance for Millard and the band. \"We just want to take a break and surface and take a gasp of air,\" he says. \"We just wanted to stop for a second and kind of let our hair down.\"\nMillard says there was definitely a lighter mood in the making of this album. \"We danced half way through making the record because we hadn't had any major tragedy,\" he confesses. \"So it was really just a blast to go through something like this and not have something real heavy lingering over our heads. I think that every song definitely has a message within itself and they can minister to people in different ways.\"\nMillard is pleased with the success of MercyMe's previous albums, but admits there's a special satisfaction in this one. \"We've always joked about wanting to make our Whiteheart 'Freedom' or our Amy Grant 'Lead Me On,' and time will tell if that is ever the case,\" Millard says, \"but we just gave it everything we had. There was no holding back on this record.\"\nThe result is a record destined to stand as a milestone in an illustrious career, but what matters most to MercyMe is the impact the music will have on others. \"Regardless of what you are going through in life, regardless of what you are consumed with, regardless of what fills up your everyday life,\" says Millard, \"there are times you have to stop and surface and take a deep breath and remember what's important. That's what this album is for us. It's addressing everything we've gone through and realizing the one common denominator in all this Jesus. That's what is worth taking a breath for.\""}

Hulu even has something it didn\u2019t when Chernin sat on its board: a presence in Japan, which might agree with a man who has a taste for Asian assets.\nA $500 million bid reflects its distressed status; last time News Corp. and Disney hung a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on Hulu in 2011, $2 billion was the asking price. That may mean licensing deals for nextday access to primetime programming aren\u2019t guaranteed for the long term, which begs a question: Why buy it?\nChernin has the advantage of knowing this property inside and out. Disadvantage: If Hulu draws the deep-pocketed companies like Google or DirecTV that came its way last time, Chernin may not be able to compete in a bidding war.\nDon\u2019t get too excited by the Hulu prospect.

He helped create national marketing organizations including Colorado Ski Country USA, Ski the Rockies and Ski New Mexico.\nNow as a ski instructor, Steve asks visiting Europeans why they choose to ski in Colorado instead of their backyard Alps. They praise American customer service and value, and they say Rocky Mountain snow and terrain are the world\u2019s best.\nBuzz continued to race in celebrity and master\u2019s ski competitions into his 60s and was active in promoting competitive skiing, leading many teams to significant competitions throughout the West.\nBuzz and Jean taught their kids to ski, and Steve\u2019s high school racing career led to a spot on the Harvard Ski Team.\nIt was only later they realized the charmed life they lived, he said.\nSteve met his wife through skiing, and now fourth-"}

Jolie walks the BBC reporter through the process of de-fanging tarantulas before cooking them and the difficulty of flipping scorpions in the pan, and then she and her kids bite into the cooked spiders. In the end, the reporter tries the unique snack herself and has to admit that it's not bad --- one of Jolie's kids compares the taste to \"flavorless chips.\"\nAngelina Jolie goes on to reveal that she first ate insects on her first visit to Cambodia, which would have been back in 2002 when she adopted her son Maddox Jolie-Pitt. But it took some time for her to start chowing down on scorpions and spiders --- she says that she started out with crickets and worked her way up to the scarier insects.\nI first had them when I was first in the country. Crickets, you start with crickets. Crickets and a beer, and then you kind of move up to tarantulas.\nThe interview was part of a piece covering Angelina Jolie's current directorial project, the Netflix documentary First They Killed My Father. Jolie is currently on location in Cambodia filming the project, which is an adaptation of human rights activist Loung Ung's memoir of the same name. Jolie has a long history with the Asian country, having adopted her first child Maddox Jolie-Pitt from the country in 2002. Since then, Jolie adopted two more children from famously war-torn countries: her daughter Zahara from Ethiopia and her son Pax from Vietnam.\nAngelina Jolie's work on this documentary comes just a few months after her divorce from long-time husband Brad Pitt shocked the world. In her full interview with BBC News, Jolie briefly discusses the divorce, saying that she and Pitt will always be a family despite splitting up.\nAt least Angelina Jolie won't have to share her food with him --- more tarantulas for her!"}

The reference revived criticism that Trump has not been strong enough in condemning hate speech and has fomented anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\"Time and time again, this president has embraced and emboldened white supremacists - and instead of condemning racist terrorists, he covers for them. This isn't normal or acceptable,\" Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, said on Twitter after Friday's mosque shootings.\nThe atrocity in Christchurch has prompted an immediate promise of stricter gun laws from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who said that the mosque attacker was a licensed gun owner and that five firearms were used during the rampage, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns.\nThe weapons also appeared to have been modified, Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Saturday.\n\"That's a challenge that we will look to address in changing our laws,\" she said.\nRules in New Zealand require gun owners to be licensed, but unlike neighbouring Australia, laws do not require all weapons to be registered, giving authorities poor oversight of the country's firearms, according to GunPolicy.org.\n\"The police don't have a clue how many guns there really are in New Zealand,\" said Philip Alpers, an Australia-based expert in gun laws and director of GunPolicy.org.\nHe said New Zealand, with a population of just under 5 million, had an estimated 1.5 million firearms.\nMilitary-style semi-automatic rifles, banned in neighbouring Australia, are permitted in New Zealand but must be registered.\nIn Australia, which is seen as culturally similar to New Zealand and has lively farming and hunting communities, the catalyst for outlawing high-powered weapons was the shooting of 35 people at Port Arthur in Tasmania in 1996.\nStrict gun law reforms received bipartisan political support at the time and there has not been a mass shooting since. Australia also held a firearms amnesty in 2017 to reduce the number of unregistered guns.\n\"I think we must be clear that the context of the gun laws between New Zealand and Australia are very different,\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday.\n\"They're very different as a result of the massacre that occurred in Australia all those years ago. But I tell you, the events of the last 24 hours - it was over 20 years ago but it all comes back ... I can only imagine now how New Zealanders are feeling. I say to them again stay strong.\"\nNew Zealand's firearm laws have remained largely unchanged since 1992, though subsequent government reviews have called for reforms.\nIn New Zealand, police officers don't routinely carry firearms.

Shares are up 7.5% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Friday.\nTheStreet Ratings rates EnLink Midstream Partners as a sell. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, poor profit margins, generally high debt management risk and generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself.\nThe company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 1674.2% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $35.60 million to -$560.40 million.\nReturn on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry and the overall market, ENLINK MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.\nThe gross profit margin for ENLINK MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP is rather low; currently it is at 23.08%. Regardless of ENLK's low profit margin, it has managed to increase from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, ENLK's net profit margin of -62.98% significantly underperformed when compared to the industry average.\nENLK's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.82 is somewhat low overall, but it is high when compared to the industry average, implying that the management of the debt levels should be evaluated further. Despite the fact that ENLK's debt-to-equity ratio is mixed in its results, the company's quick ratio of 0.58 is low and demonstrates weak liquidity.\nThe share price of ENLINK MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP has not done very well: it is down 11.38% and has underperformed the S&P 500, in part reflecting the company's sharply declining earnings per share when compared to the year-earlier quarter. Turning toward the future, the fact that the stock has come down in price over the past year should not necessarily be interpreted as a negative; it could be one of the factors that may help make the stock attractive down the road.

The study was conducted using senior exit interviews and surveys administered by the Office of Institutional Research, Planning, and Assessment every four years at freshman orientation.\nThis study, Alison Takahashi, Lean In president and MCAS \u201916, said, is particularly alarming because admitted females have higher GPAs and SAT scores than their male counterparts. Females at BC, she said, are also better at maintaining their GPAs than males.\nThe study that was conducted on female students\u2019 self-esteem has led to numerous initiatives on campus to encourage dialogue and educate students on this issue, Takahashi said.\nOne such initiative is Feminist Coming Out Day, which was held on Stokes Lawn on Monday. It is an annual event on campus that aims to promote dialogue on feminism. The sponsors include the history, English, psychology, and sociology departments, the Institute for Liberal Arts, the Women\u2019s Center, and UGBC.\nThe event first began in 2012 under the direction of history professor Arissa Oh.\n\u201cIn my first couple of years at BC\u2014I arrived in 2010\u2014 I noticed that a lot of the female students I met were really reticent to identify as feminists,\u201d Oh said.\nShe wanted to let students know that it\u2019s okay to voice their beliefs in gender equality.\nThe collaboration of many groups, Katie Dalton, director of the Women\u2019s Center, said in an email, made the event more visible and widespread than in past years.\nThis year, they had 300 participants. Students who visited the tent could pick up stickers and buttons that said \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like.\u201d There were also pieces of paper that said \u201cI am a feminist because\u2026\u201d and participants could fill out their responses. Participants who then posed for a photo with their completed poster got a Georgetown cupcake.\n\u201cOur goal for this event is not to exclusively showcase student who already identify himself or herself as a feminist, but to also extend the conversation to students who may be questioning or in opposition to a feminist identity,\u201d Takahashi said.\nThey also hope to provide a safe space for students to talk about their different views on feminism, to raise awareness on feminism, and to educate students on feminism.\nBecause the freshman and senior surveys are only conducted every four years, they will not know the extent to which Feminist Coming Out Day and other events on campus have affected self perceptions until next year, Dalton said.\nAlthough it is hard to tell scientifically if there have been any changes on campus with regard to feminism, Oh said, she does think that students are more willing to express their beliefs.\nIts irritating that feminists are constantly saying this and playing the curious charade, as to why people aren\u2019t calling themselves feminists.\nFirst of all, in order for someone to be a feminist, they have to qualify.

U.S. officials also warn any form of participation in the sector could also see someone turned away, signalling potential headaches for investors.\nCanada is due to legalize recreational use of the drug on Oct. 17, but it is still illegal under U.S. federal law, despite major states like Colorado and California loosening restrictions. Justin Trudeau\u2019s government and travel agents are warning Canadians to make sure they have no trace of the drug in their cars or luggage.\n\u201cWorking or having involvement in the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual\u2019s admissibility to the U.S.,\u201d Mike Niezgoda, a spokesman at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Buffalo, said in an email.\nSimilar comments made by a border official to Politico sent U.S.-traded shares of Canadian marijuana companies tumbling Thursday. Cannabis stocks have been soaring since mid-August, when Canopy Growth Corp. announced a $5 billion (US$3.8 billion) investment from Constellation Brands Inc., the biggest deal in the sector to date.\nThose at risk include people in border towns who frequently cross over to buy gas or milk, tourists and transport workers who haul billions of dollars a month of goods into the U.S. Even executives at weed companies could be accused of bringing the trade where it\u2019s not welcome.\nThe rub is that it\u2019s illegal to have smoked the drug in Canada before Oct. 17, and it\u2019s illegal to lie to any border agent who asks about it. Some 4.6 million Canadians use weed, about 16 per cent of the adult population.\n\u201cAlthough medical and recreational marijuana may be legal in some U.S. States and Canada, the sale, possession, production and distribution of marijuana remain illegal under U.S. federal law,\u201d Niezgoda said.\nAnother official said those participating in the marijuana business may be turned away at the border. \u201cFacilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual\u2019s admissibility to the U.S.,\u201d Todd Owen, executive assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, told Politico in comments published Thursday.\nWhile Owen didn\u2019t specify any minimum level of investment, he signalled the focus was more on those bringing the sector to the U.S., which could have implications for the burgeoning sector.

It seemed simple enough, but we soon found out that there weren't too many practical or inexpensive ways to accomplish such a task.\nCreative has offered a solution to the situation and while it may not be inexpensive, it's an easy and painless way to get your PC or Mac audio streaming directly to external speakers or a receiver. The system isn't without its faults, but we really enjoyed the overall performance of the device.\nThe Sound Blaster Wireless System for iTunes and Receiver is actually a bundle featuring two separate products. First, the wireless system for iTunes is simply a USB dongle that transmits audio from your computer to a Creative receiver. The second product is an actual wireless audio receiver that can connect to external speakers or an AV receiver. Creative has combined the two into a wireless system that retails for around $150 online.\nSetting up the wireless system is fairly straightforward. You attach the USB dongle into an open port on your computer and then set up the receiver next to your external speakers or AV receiver. The rear of the receiver has two line-out connections: a 1/8 inch jack and an RCA analog stereo out. The receiver requires a power supply, which is included with the package.\nThe receiver is small and offers two line-out connections.\nTo get the dongle and receiver to sync, you hold down the USB dongle \"connect\" button for a moment, then scoot over to the receiver and do the same to the \"link\" button on the rear. Once paired, a white LED light will remain statically lit on the front of the receiver. After the connection has been made, all audio from your computer will then stream to the wireless receiver.\nThe receiver itself has a play/pause button in addition to skip forward and backward track buttons. It's quite small and should fit snugly in your entertainment center. The white LED light it projects may be a bit bright, especially if you're using it in a dark room. The included remote control has a series of buttons, some of which will only work if you're using a more featured receiver (such as the MovieWorks HD dock). For use with the bundle system we're reviewing here, you'll only be able to use the volume, mute, play/pause, and skip track buttons. All that aside, you'll only be able to control tracks when using a PC.\nThe USB dongle has two LED indicators: a power and link light. The link light will stay lit when connected to the receiver.

{"idx": "36739", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Ever since Napster lost its bad-boy luster, the other digital music It-wares, Aimster, has been rightfully sucking up the glare. Released last year from a start-up in Troy, New York, Aimster transforms America Online\u2019s ubiquitous instant messaging software into a lay person\u2019s Napster; instead of just trading messages, designated \u201cbuddies\u201d can swap song files as well.\nNow after virtually bringing Napster to its knees, the Recording Industry Association of America has been understandably setting its sights on the Trojan Horse that is Aimster. Thing is, the instant music beast might be more stubborn than the RIAA perceives because there isn\u2019t just Aimster to contend with, there\u2019s Microsoft.\nIn early June, Microsoft officially announced that it would be extending the reach and scope of its Windows Messaging software, the company\u2019s equivalent of the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). Most significantly, the software, which is expected to ship with the October release of the new Windows XP operating system, will give users the ability to swap music, video and text files across the Internet.\nNow, of course, there\u2019s no reason to expect that Microsoft\u2019s new system will be anywhere near as bootleg-friendly as Aimster or Napster, but its very presence is a sign of the times. File-trading, whether through the underground (the old Napster, Gnutella, Freenet) or the over-ground (the new Napster, AOL, Microsoft), is an irrepressible part of the digital landscape. And even if Microsoft includes some kind of filtering software to weed out bootlegs, rest assured that someone, maybe even the dudes in Troy, New York, will find a way to hotwire it.\nAlready, the RIAA is not having as easy of a time crushing Aimster as it did Napster back in March, when it forced Napster to filter copyright protected songs from its computer servers. The RIAA filed a lawsuit basically on the same grounds against Aimster this summer, asserting that the software was created specifically with the purpose of facilitating copyright infringement. But it\u2019s not that cut and dry.\nAimster is merely a means for trading files, not a repository for illegal files. All the songs that are exchanged, for example, simply pass through Aimster\u2019s shell; the files themselves reside only on the sender\u2019s and recipient\u2019s computers. The reason it was so easy to essentially shut down Napster\u2019s black market trades was because the company was providing its own computer servers as the central brains/guts of the operation. This, for that matter, is precisely why decentralized systems like Gnutella and Freenet will be so difficult, if not impossible to shut down.\nIn the end, however, one would fully expect Aimster to get quashed, if only because it\u2019s still, at heart, a small start-up with no real power; the Aimster developers will have a hard time arguing why the program/company should exist in its current state. But even if it dies, it won\u2019t be the end of the IM conundrum. Innovations like Microsoft\u2019s new messaging software are just the beginning; there are unquestionably many more permutations of free and easy file-trading programs to come. The illicit beat goes on."}

Those that want [that integrated offering, can] participate. When they don't, they don't have to.\"\nSilverman concedes that the 35% turnover rate in 2006 is high, though she asserts it's typical for a firm its size. Still, Ogilvy is trying to curb turnover through new training programs, like its Core Curriculum course that all entry- and junior-level associates in DC and New York must take. Ogilvy's two-day Managing for Performance program trained about 60 EVPs, SVPs, and VPs during 2006.\nPublic affairs has continued to benefit from the 2005 acquisition of what is now called Ogilvy Government Relations. Also, the new, Democratic-controlled Congress has been very active in government oversight hearings, creating new opportunities for public affairs firms in representing corporate clients called to testify on Capitol Hill. Ogilvy has also sought to expand in the digital realm with 360 Degree Digital Influence helping reach target audiences and manage brands online.\nThe healthcare communications boom has helped Ogilvy, most dramatically with a recent three-year, $9 million award from the US Department of Health and Human Services for communications preparedness for pandemic flu. While social marketing showed the slowest growth among the firm's practice areas in 2006, along with its corporate practice, work on pandemic flu communications and other issues will help Ogilvy reinvigorate both business areas.\n\"I sound optimistic - and I am,\" Silverman says.\nOgilvy PR globally has a staff of 1,573, up about 20% from 2005. Turnover was 35%. Senior hires during 2006 included MD Chris John, former member of Congress; MD of insights and research Jennifer Scott, previously with Strategy One; a new MD of PR and public affairs in Brussels, Natalie Sarkic-Todd, formerly with public affairs agency EPPA; SVP of media strategies and executive positioning Louise Kehoe, a former Silicon Valley bureau chief for the Financial Times; a new CEO of Ogilvy PR EMEA, Martin Liptrot, who was previously MD of global communications for FedEx; Ogilvy PR Japan president Orlando Camargo, previously VP and director of corporate communications at Goldman Sachs in Japan; and MD of healthcare, strategy, and planning Michael Durand, previously with Porter Novelli.

Ferrera and Jack Grinband of Columbia University.\nThe team found that it takes at least 120 milliseconds for the brain to switch its attention from task to task. That's roughly the time it takes to quickly double-click a mouse, but in the realm of neuroscience, it counts.\n\"This may not seem like very much,\" Teichert told Business Insider, but each time the brain adjusts its focus, it is expending energy.\nTeichert's team conducted experiments in which subjects needed to determine which way dots on a screen were moving while a second set of brighter dots (distractors) moved separately. They measured how long it took for the subjects to accurately ignore distractors moving in the opposite direction and arrived at the average of 120 milliseconds.\nTeichert said that these findings can be used practically. If you spend your day constantly switching focus from the task at hand to irrelevant distractions or other tasks, it confuses and exhausts your brain. \"By the end of the day you may end up making worse decisions just because your attentional system can't keep up,\" Teichert said.\nNext time you're confronted with a decision, then, take a moment to clear your head and consciously focus on the task in front of you. Waiting just a split second allows the decision-making part of your brain to catch up."}

The company provides comprehensive services to these mothers to stabilize their lives and give birth to healthy babies. Existing investors Frist Cressey Ventures, Resolute Venture Partners and Altitude Ventures, also participated in the round.\nThe opioid epidemic has risen to unprecedented levels in the United States. Though some regulatory actions have been taken to manage the crisis, the number of Americans dependent on a substance is staggering. According to the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, more than 20.5 million Americans were living with a substance use disorder in 2015.\nThe rise of the opioid crisis is accompanied by an increase in the rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a costly post-natal condition where newborns who were exposed to opioids during pregnancy experience painful withdrawal symptoms, including central nervous and gastrointestinal issues as well as increased long-term behavioral and medical risks. According to the National Institutes of Health in 2012, a baby is born with NAS nearly every 25 minutes in the United States.\nSeveral states are also reporting more children being diagnosed with NAS than with autism and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 80 percent of American babies born with NAS are covered by Medicaid. 180 Health Partners works with health plans to provide opioid dependent mothers with a comprehensive care team to resolve the socio-economic, behavioral and medical challenges these mothers face. Through 180 Health Partners, opioid dependent mothers have access to a peer advocate, an addiction counselor and social worker, a nurse, and a resource advocate. The company\u2019s solution meaningfully reduces the incidence, or severity, of opioid dependent births and significantly reduces the overall cost of care.\n180 Health Partners has primarily served patients throughout Tennessee and is currently contracted with all the Medicaid health plans in the state. With this round of funding, the company will launch its program in other states with similar critical need.\nNashville-based 180 Health Partners deploys teams of experienced counselors, social workers, nurses, and peer support specialists who partner with qualified providers, health plans and their expecting mothers to stabilize all aspects of their lives and support their goals for themselves and their babies. 180\u2019s cross-functional care teams provide personalized engagement and care plans for expecting mothers to simplify the complex balance of their medical, addiction, behavioral, environmental and lifestyle needs by directly filling the gaps in care while also matching members with the best team of resources for each member\u2019s specific journey. 180 is focused on preventing the occurrence of and/or drastically reducing the severity of NAS while also establishing a stabilized social framework for the mother\u2019s long-term success in sobriety and motherhood."}

When it comes to insuring roofs, it is.\nRefusing to renew existing homeowner insurance policies on houses with roofs older than 20 years without passing an inspection; failed inspections often require roof replacement prior to renewal.\nNot writing new policies for homes with roofs over 20 years old.\nPaying actual cash value for roof replacement for older roofs.\nAs expensive as it may be to replace a roof, you may have no choice if doing nothing would cost you your home insurance policy, according to Chip Merlin, president of Tampa-based Merlin Law Group, P.A.\n\"Insurance companies are generally tightening underwriting requirements for older homes in general -- and then specific homes where there has not been a replacement of roofs, plumbing or electrical. Roofs are the biggest issue,\" says Merlin. \"Generally, in geographic areas where the demand of insurance exceeds the insurance company's appetite for risk, the greater the underwriting criteria come into play. Florida is such a state, but we are also seeing it along all coastal areas and in areas where hail damage is most prevalent.\"\n\"The trend is to require an older roof - 15 to 20 years plus -- to have an inspection to get a renewal. This is probably a good policy because it promotes better maintenance and reduces needless loss,\" says Merlin.\nInsurance.com Managing Editor Des Toups says new homeowners whose roofs passed muster with a home inspector or lender may find they don't measure up to an insurance company's underwriting guidelines. \"It's a nasty surprise, especially if you were stretching to buy a house in the first place,\" he says.\nAccording to Scott deLuise, president of Matrix Business Consulting in Broomfield, Colorado, many insurers on the West Coast are adding new endorsements upon renewal for the area's popular wooden shingle roofs.\n\"There are different variations. Insurers are trying to limit liability for all types of roof claims for wind or hail or anything other than fire. The only way they can do that is by changing types of coverage. Here in Colorado we're seeing wooden shake endorsements, and what some companies are doing is only insuring them on an actual-cash-value basis, meaning that those roofs are only covered for what they're worth at the time instead of for the cost of replacement,\" says deLuise.\nA wood shake or shingle endorsement is a written document attached to an insurance policy that excludes or restricts coverage of roofs made of wooden shingles or shakes.\nAnother example of the shift to actual cash value from cost of replacement: Allstate launched a program in 2012 in Oklahoma in which policyholders with roofs more than 10 years old receive actual cash value for roof replacement. What that means is homeowners have to pay the bill for expenses beyond the claim payout for damaged roofs that have depreciated value. Allstate is gradually expanding the program nationwide.\nDeLuise has also seen many companies limit appraisal for wind and hail roof damage during the claims process.\nIf the policyholder demands appraisal, what insurance companies are doing is trying to limit the scope of the appraisal to damages that they've agreed to instead of all of the damage that the insured might find. \"This effectively guts the appraisal clause in the policy. For example, if you have a metal roof and file a claim for hail damage, they may come back"}

Mike Lee of Utah then interjected, raising a point of order.\n\"If there is a list of names he can be given of the lawyers to whom she is referring, I think that's fine,\" Lee said. \"But I think it's unfair to suggest that an entire law firm should be imputed into the witness's memory when he doesn't know who works at the law firm.\"\nHarris, who has been mentioned as a 2020 presidential contender, returned to questioning Kavanaugh, asking him again if he had a conversation with anyone about Mueller's investigation.\n\"The fact that it's ongoing, it's a topic in the news every day, I talk to fellow judges about it. It's the courthouse in the District of Columbia.

While this may seem like an ordinary arrest, it was not.\nThis quick and efficient arrest is just one of many that have been occurring thanks to new programs that GPD is using to improve communication within the department and to fight crime more accurately, according to Lt. Art Adkins.\nIf it weren't for the new programs, the patrol officers who made the arrest would not have been given the heads up to watch out for burglaries in the area, and they likely may not have spotted the theft in progress.\nThe new systems use computers to alert each tier of law enforcement about crime patterns in the Gainesville area and are bringing the department one step closer to so-called \"information-led\" policing, said Adkins.\nAccording to Adkins, the new crime prevention programs, put into practice in January, allow analysts to put together \"crime snapshots\" each morning, letting officers in all three districts know if any crime patterns have surfaced during the past 24 hours. The analysts then send those alerts to the patrol officers via computer.\n\"Every morning, after a 24-hour period, our analysts come together and we look at crime trends, patterns, anyone of note or anything that's occurring in the community,\" Adkins said, describing what they call a Crime Snapshot Hot Shot Briefing.\n\"We compare that to crime statistics and historical data, and then we formulate a \"snapshot\" to be sent out to everyone at the agency via computer. Within 24 hours, the system tells management and the officers what's been going on.\"\nGPD has 15 databases that hold the information about all police-related events, and Adkins said that in the past, there was no way officers were able to look through all that information to patrol effectively.\nNow, analysts search through the databases looking for patterns. If there are three or more similar crimes in one area, the analysts will create a \"crime snapshot:\" a one-page spreadsheet that is sent to the laptops in each patrol car in real time.\nThis is how the copper wire burglar was caught.\nAdkins said that in his 28 years of law enforcement, these programs have been the most revolutionary in fighting crime. He said that while automated systems were perhaps the first significant change, the problem arose when there was no way to share the information in the department's 15 databases with everyone.\n\"The problem you ran into (in the past) was that all of these databases won't talk to each other,\" he said.\n\"You have to create an interface, and that's what these new programs are doing.\"\n\"With information-led policing, we are able to direct our resources to where they're needed. It's far more efficient and effective, because the officer is seeing the same information I'm seeing as a lieutenant at the same time.\"\nGPD analysts Carolyn Cassidy, Ericka Jackson and Erika Pyne were recently commended by the chief of police for their efforts and were presented with a certificate of excellence in producing the crime snapshots. Most importantly, more arrests have been made of the correct people, Adkins said.\n\"We didn't birth the idea of sharing the information,"}

But co-founder Biz Stone is taking pains now to apologize for what he called \"the replies kerfuffle,\" while re-emphasizing that the feature won't be coming back.\nLike all successful social networks, Twitter has developed a venue that puts strangers in a peculiar proximity to one another without it seeming totally creepy. And while a communications lapse by a company in the communication business is worth a couple of laughs, it's hard to see this as much more than a trumped-up tempest fueled by the sense of entitlement we have over the internet, another reminder that consumers believe that they own the brand.\nThe feature at issue, the @replies option \u2013 a non-default setting to monitor a conversation (half of it, anyway) between someone you follow and someone you don't, was only used by 3 percent of the Twitter universe, Stone blogged Thursday. In truth its use is a little mind-bending even by the standards of an asymmetrical social network. You see only what the person you follow says in reply to a Tweet you didn't see from someone you don't know. I opted in for a while, but the signal-to-noise ratio \u2014 especially on a mobile phone, where I follow my most closest contacts \u2014 became excruciating.\nIt may not have had many users but it suddenly had many supporters outraged that Twitter had acted unilaterally and without warning, the sort of thing that habitually gets Facebook into hot water, and a barrage of #fixreplies and #twitterfail ire was unleashed. When the tweets hit the fan Stone said the feature was jettisoned because it was \"undesirable and confusing.\" Now Stone is eating crow, saying \"I did not do my homework.\" But he's also saying you can't have it back.\n\"... We cannot turn this setting back on in its original form for technical reasons and we won't rebuild it exactly the same for product design reasons,\" Stone blogged Thursday, perhaps unwittingly revealing just how sensitive the Twitter infrastructure is.\n\"Even though only 3% of all Twitter accounts ever changed this setting away from the default, it was causing a strain and impacting other parts of the system,\" Stone wrote. \"Every time someone wrote a reply Twitter had to check and see what each of their followers' reply settings was and then manifest that tweet accordingly in their timeline\u2014this was the most expensive work the database was doing and it was causing other features to degrade which lead to SMS delays, inconsistencies in following, fluctuations in direct message counts, and more.\"\nSo why would you even want to eavesdrop on half a conversation anyway, which is about as satisfying as putting up with the phone calls of the person in the next cubicle? Many who pushed back said the feature was a great discovery tool, a way to find other users with some likely affinity by virtue of being someone who is followed by someone you follow \u2014 call it one degree of separation instead of a serendipitous find on the public timeline or in a search.\nTwitter itself is pushing the follow-feeding frenzy by suggesting to possible Twitterers that new signups may wish to follow to get the ball rolling.

Jane McWilliams Hardman from May 2018.[i] In December 1973, then-Lts. McWilliams and Victoria Voge made history as the first female flight surgeons in the Navy. Hardman would go on to serve over 20 years in the Navy as a flight surgeon and aviation pathologist. Although retired in 1993, Hardman would briefly return to service after Sept. 11, 2001 serving as the laboratory director at Naval Hospital Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. In this lightly edited excerpt, Hardman relates her first experiences in the Navy, and becoming a flight surgeon.\nWhen I first started [at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)],[ii] I intended to become an engineer like my father, but eventually I decided I liked biology better. In my freshman year, there were 20 ladies in my class, and maybe there were 40 females in the whole student body of 4,000, so I was used to feeling like an outsider, which helped me a lot going forward.\nThe summer before my senior year, I enlisted in the Navy and attended Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island, with the expectation of a commission when I graduated. I also applied to medical school.\nThere weren\u2019t very many opportunities for women to do cool things in the Navy then. I was just about to graduate from a challenging math and science program at RPI, and even though I loved being in the Navy, when I was accepted into medical school, I never looked back.\nI spent a lot of time during my medical training trying to figure out whether I really wanted to be a physician. There were fewer females than males, and many of the women went into pediatrics. I thought I was going to do something else, so I decided to take an internal medicine internship and I ended up in Syracuse. You didn\u2019t get any sleep; some people treated you terribly, but this wasn\u2019t peculiar to Syracuse. All internships were like this at the time, but I thought I would like to do something else besides internal medicine. Just about that time, Admiral [Elmo] Zumwalt[iii] had this really fantastic idea to train women to fly in the Navy.[iv] Someone in the [naval] hierarchy decided that if there were going to be female pilots, there should be female flight surgeons. It was just about the same time that I called the Navy recruiter in Syracuse and said I wanted to be a flight surgeon.\nIt\u2019s funny, because I called the Air Force first and they put me in touch with the nurse recruiter; they just didn\u2019t know what to do with my request. But the first class petty officer who was at the Navy recruiting agency had done his homework and it just fell into place. So, at the end of my internship, I was sworn into the Navy a second time. In the meantime, they recruited another lady[v] to be in that same class [at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI)].\nVickie Voge was a real hard worker, a really nice kid, and the two of us were treated with great respect by our colleagues, many of whom were Berry Planners[vi] who had put off the Doctor Draft. Some were really enthusiastic, and some did not necessarily want to be in the military. I think we were well treated by the staff at NAMI,[vii] as well. We had a great time. It was"}

It is not true. It is the project of \u2018regime destabilizers\u2019. They have done it elsewhere in the world and Sri Lanka\u2019s past or present experiences are certainly not unique. Initially Project Destabilizing Sri Lanka was India\u2019s, but with time neo-colonialists of the West, Tamil diaspora and various vested interest NGOs came to be driving partners as well. None of these, however, explains the reasons for the incumbent Sri Lankan Government to kowtow to these adverse elements as they do presently.\nThis Government knows they have neither the mandate nor the support of even their own supporters to do so. Hence, during their entire tenure, which is nearing three years in office now, their entire performance has been of a magician. A rather a bad magician, at that, as they unwittingly reveal the trick they played sooner than later.\nFrom the beginning they continue to divert our attention to one thing only, to conjure an unexpected spectacle. Unfortunately, the experience is horrifying than thrilling.\nThey came to power pledging to do away the Executive Presidency and to empower Parliament. Apart from term limit, term duration and other minor matters as when the Execution President may dissolve Parliament, the powers of the Executive Presidency is still largely untouched. On the other hand, what is being proposed and under consideration is not empowering Parliament, but reducing it to a ceremonial assembly and the periphery, that is the provinces, to be empowered. If that comes to being, it is immaterial whether the Executive Presidency survives or not, as that position would be with almost no powers.\nPromising a change, the two main political rivals the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party joined to form a Government called the Unity Government. If this seemed a panacea for the political divide our country suffered for decades, it soon proved to be otherwise. In fact, we are now in a worse situation after this political marriage than before.\nThe reason being, it took us a while to realize that both our Government and our official Opposition are on the same side. When our Opposition Leader Sambanthan asked India to protect this Government to continue to be in power, it certainly seems both have the same boss.\nWhen he has not shown any interest in any other national matter or crisis and has been only obsessed with a new Constitution, it is not difficult to understand why he is so protective of this Government.\nThroughout his political career his agenda has been separatism. Now he plays the role of a respectable politician. In the days of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, he played the despicable part of acting as their political proxy. He continued unabated while the LTTE dragged children as young as eight to become cannon fodder. Even now he hints of the possibility of a resurgence of terrorism if demands are not met. Clearly, he has no qualms over the horror the Tamils faced because of the LTTE. It is this callousness that unmasks the separatists.\nIt is in this background that PM Ranil Wickremesinghe released the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee\u2019s interim report on the proposals to Parliament on 29 September 2017. The debate on that report will continue for three days. It is hoped that, thereafter, the final report can be compiled by year end."}

And yet, thanks to clever accounting by multinational companies like Google, hundreds of millions of Euros continue to escape overseas.\nPerhaps the only surprise uncovered by a recent Guardian report on the finances of the search giant's Irish subsidiary was the revelation that Google, actually pays an effective 20 per cent rate on its earnings in Ireland, when the country's corporation tax - one of the lowest in Europe - stands at just 12.5 per cent.\nGood news, you'd think. But not when you realise what tiny proportion of its vast profits the company actually pays that tax on. After a mammoth payment of \u20ac5.467 billion for \"administrative expenses\" is deducted, the \u20ac5.5 billion gross profit revealed in Google's 2009 accounts shrinks to just \u20ac45 million.\nWhat that means for the Irish economy is that instead of many hundreds of millions in tax, the search giant pays just \u20ac9.6 million.\nNotes to the company's accounts show that Google's \"administrative expenses\" rose significantly between 2008 and 2009 - by \u20ac794 million - partially due to a rise in the number of people employed by its European subsidiary, as well as in sales and marketing costs - but also due to increases in \"royalties paid as a result of increases in recorded turnover\".\nAnd there's the rub. The lion's share of Google's \"administrative expenses\" arise from royalty payments - effectively a licence fee - which Google pays to its own headquarters, stationed in the tax haven of Bermuda, for the right to operate.\n\"Google complies fully with all relevant tax legislation in all the countries in which it operates. That means that we contribute to all relevant local and national taxation schemes - as well as providing employment for approaching 2,000 people in Ireland.\n\"The profits of our Irish entity are consistent with the activities we perform in Ireland. Google's profits in Ireland or any other country are not solely due to the local operations but relate to significant investments in R&D, data centers and other functions and risks performed outside of Ireland.\"\nThe Guardian's findings echo research last year by Bloomberg which revealed Google had cut its tax liabilities by a massive $3.1 billion over the previous three years by shifting its income around the globe, resulting in an overall tax rate overseas of just 2.4 per cent.\nThe reason Google can carry out its colossal tax dodge is the fact that the company's profits rely heavily on intellectual property (IP) - search algorithms, patented software and the like.\nBeing intangible, that IP can 'reside' just about anywhere Google likes - and it just so happens that the company has chosen to set it down on the sunny island of Bermuda, where it attracts next to no tax. Google's subsidiaries elsewhere in the world pay royalties to use the technology owned by Google's Bermuda operation - rather cutely called Google Ireland Holdings - effectively wiping out their gross profits, and leaving little left on which to pay tax.\n\"As long as the intellectual property is in Bermuda, that is where the profits reside. Ireland has no rights to the profit earned by the intellectual property based in another country.\"\n\"Accordingly, the key issue is how the IP was"}

Rowdy elements supported by self styled leaders and dubious groups have been reported to chant Jai Shri Ram and Radhe Radhe at the public sites where Muslims offer Friday Namaz.\nMuch of the Muslim population in Gurgaon largely constitute of poor migrants from various states and do not have sufficient number of mosques which can accommodate Friday congregation. These prayers are offered at over 100 public locations while the number of mosques in Gurgaon are not even 15. Therefore denying the Muslim community access to public place tantamounts to denying them the constitutional legal right to practice ones religion.\nConcerned at the developments, a team of Swaraj India delegation led by party leader Anupam delved into all aspects of the case by talking to leaders and individuals from both the communities in Gurgaon. The team also met the Commissioner of Police in order to get the administrative perspective and chalk out a harmonious solution.\nThe Swaraj team has suggested that in case there is any specific location where Friday gathering creates public disturbance, it should be looked into and resolved through a dialogue with the administration. If needed, such location may be barred from congregation. But once the public spaces are marked, it is the duty of state government and administration to ensure that the faithfuls are allowed to offer prayers peacefully.

This, by the way, remains a controversial point of view, and most industry observers will take the position that companies get distracted if they try to bootstrap a product with a service. At 1M/1M, we take a pragmatic and contrarian position, and back it up with numerous case studies. From where we sit, bootstrapping products with services is a tried and true method.\nRailsFactory, a consulting and app development company that provides solutions for the web application framework Ruby on Rails, was co-founded by Senthil Nayagam and Dinesh Kumar in 2006. RailsFactory provides numerous services\u2014primarily focusing on app development for the Ruby on Rails platform, but also including Rails version migration, e-commerce solutions, e-mail campaign system implementation, and iPhone and Android app development.\nSenthil and Dinesh bootstrapped RailsFactory themselves, starting with about $1,250 in seed money.

But they started generating revenues fast\u2014thanks to the services they offered, they were generating revenue by their second month, and they\u2019ve been growing since. To date, RailsFactory has executed over 100 projects and has worked with clients in the US, Canada, India, Australia, Singapore, and the UK. Their services revenues have crossed a couple of million dollars, and the company has recently built a product that they have started validating with those 100 services customers. The productized offering enables them to offer a support package to the small- to medium-sized enterprise segment based on packs of trouble tickets.\nSimilarly, Mansa Systems is a SaaS-based IT company, founded by Siva Devaki in San Francisco in 2006.

Superintendent John Deasy recently announced he would push this summer to remove chocolate and strawberry milk from school menus.\nBut nutritionists \u2014 and parents \u2014 are split over whether bans make sense, especially when about 70 percent of milk consumed in schools is flavored, mostly chocolate, according to the industry-backed Milk Processors Education Program.\nMany, including the School Nutrition Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, and National Medical Association, argue that the nutritional value of flavored low-fat or skim milk outweighs the harm of added sugar. Milk contains nine essential nutrients including calcium, vitamin D and protein.\nA joint statement from those groups points to studies that show kids who drink fat-free, flavored milk meet more of their nutrient needs and are not heavier than non-milk drinkers.\n\"Chocolate milk has been unfairly pegged as one of the causes of obesity,\" said Julie Buric, vice president of marketing for the Milk Processors Education Program.\nOthers note the nation's child obesity epidemic and say flavored milk simply needs to go.\nEight ounces of white milk served in Los Angeles public schools contains 14 grams of natural sugar or lactose; fat-free chocolate milk has an extra six grams of sugar for a total of 20 grams, while fat-free strawberry milk has a total of 27 grams \u2014 the same as eight ounces of Coca-Cola.\n\"Chocolate milk is soda in drag,\" said Ann Cooper, director of nutrition services for the Boulder Valley School District in Louisville, Colo., which has banned flavored milk. \"It works as a treat in homes, but it doesn't belong in schools.\"\nFlavored milk is also a target of British TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has made revamping school food a signature cause.\nFor a segment to be aired on his \"Food Revolution\" TV show, he recently filled a school bus with white sand to represent the amount of sugar Los Angeles Unified school children consume weekly in flavored milk.\n\"If you have flavored milk, that's candy,\" he told The Associated Press.\nOliver cheered Deasy's proposal to remove flavored milk from schools during a recent joint appearance on the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show.\nIf the school board adopts the ban, Los Angeles Unified would join districts including Washington and Berkeley, Calif.\nBut efforts by some other districts turned sour after children drank less milk. Milk consumption drops by 35 percent when flavored milks are removed, according to the Milk Processors Education Program.\nCabell County, W.Va., schools brought chocolate milk back at the recommendation of state officials, and Fairfax County, Va., did the same after its dairy provider came up with a version sweetened with beet sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup.\nThe Florida Board of Education also backed away from its proposed ban on chocolate milk after the state agricultural commissioner urged the board to look at all sugary food and beverages served in schools.\nThe Los Angeles district has worked with its dairy supplier"}

{"idx": "36785", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Dongba symbols are an ancient system of pictographic glyphs created by the founder of the B\u00f6n religious tradition of Tibet and used by the Naxi people in southern China. Historical records show that this unique script was used as early as the 7th century, during the early Tang Dynasty, however, research conducted last year showed that its origins may date back as far as 7,000 years ago. Incredibly, the Dongba symbols continue to be used by the elders of the Naxi people, making it the only hieroglyphic language still used in the world today.\nThe Naxi people lived in the beautiful mountain province of Yunnan (\u201csouth of the clouds\u201d) for thousands of years, where they developed their own rich and enduring culture. Today, most of the 270,000 Naxi people live in the county of Lijiang where they retain many of their ancient traditions.\nThe Dongba script of the Naxi people is both pictographic and ideographic. The writing, unlike anything known elsewhere, superficially resembles the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, but it has a certain action and humour that distinguishes it from other scripts. While there are only about 1,300 symbols in total, the script has been used to write a huge number of scriptures, from incredible tales of creation to methods for carrying out exorcism. They also provide a kind of encyclopaedia of the ancient Naxi people, recording in detail their beliefs, customs, traditions and ways of life.\nIt is not a simplistic system of writing. Illustrations were used to represent not only material objects but also abstract ideas, syllables, and even methods of pronunciation. For example, the character \u2018cliff\u2019 has the form of a cliff and it has the same pronunciation as \u2018chicken\u2019, which is illustrated by a chicken head drawn inside the cliff. A single pictograph can also be used to recite different phrases or an entire sentence. The script is incredibly logical \u2013 when a symbol is drawn upside down it indicates negation; straight lines drawn between people indicates \u2018fight\u2019, while entwined lines represent \u2018discuss\u2019; a dead animal is drawn as usual but without pupils in the eyes.\nHistorically, the Dongba script was used by the Dongba priests, and the creation and development of the script is closely connected to the emergence of the Dongba religion. The Dongba religion was rooted in the beliefs of the Tibetan B\u00f6n religion \u2013 the word \u201cDongba\u201d literally means \u201cwise man\u201d in the Naxi language. Historians have traced origins to a B\u00f6n shaman from eastern Tibet named Dongba Shilo, who lived in a cave near Baishuitai 900 years ago.\nB\u00f6n lamas are believed to have settled among the Naxi as farmers, and to have begun to practice exorcisms as a way of earning a little money on the side. By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge religious vocabulary accompanied by a variety of rituals. Their scriptures contain several kinds of rituals and also legends, poetry, prayers, astronomy, medicine, and divination. As Zhu Bao-Tian, a noted cultural anthropologist from the Yunnan Provincial Museum in China, said: \u201cThe Naxi manuscripts are a living fossil for the study of ancient culture\u201d.\nAlthough today many Naxi are not religious, in the 1940s there were more than 4,000 Naxi Dongba priests.

The new eatery isn\u2019t afraid to move past the classics, instead taking a fresh approach to Latin American cuisine.\nLocated in Mishawaka \u2014 but still a quick drive from campus \u2014 the restaurant announces itself with a massive \u201cJes\u00fas\u201d sign studded with golden lightbulbs. In appropriate hipster fashion, owner George Pesek opened Jes\u00fas in the long-defunct Carnegie Library building. The interior is well-lit and equally trendy, with exposed brick walls and low-hanging light fixtures. It\u2019s not a place for quiet conversation \u2014 the music was more \u201cdiscoteca\u201d than dinner vibes, but reggaeton fans will feel right at home.\nJes\u00fas belongs squarely in a separate category from student mainstays like Salsa\u2019s and Hacienda in that the food is much more of a focus than the drinks \u2014 but if you did come to get tipsy and are of legal age, have no fear. The classic margarita is delicious and amply sized, while the specialty margaritas are some of the best in town. The spicy poblano \u201cmezcalrita\u201d boasts a strong smoky flavor with a kick from jalape\u00f1o peppers, and despite being made with real mezcal, is actually a dollar cheaper than the classic. Fans of sweeter cocktails can opt for drinks flavored with cachaca (sweet rum) or tamarind juice.\nThe menu integrates influences as diverse as Mexican, Venezuelan, Argentinian and Puerto Rican cuisines into an impressive list of offerings. Those looking to save money should stick with tacos or tortas, but if you\u2019re willing to splurge for a date night (or have family paying the bill), go for a specialty dish: either one of the Latin American classics, or something off the Argentinian wood fire grill.\nService was quick, with our beautifully arranged dishes arriving not long after the margaritas we ordered. Every meal I\u2019ve tried so far at Jes\u00fas has been great on its own, but the best way to enjoy this place is with at least one other person, sharing drinks and dishes to fully experience the range of flavors it has to offer. I ordered the cochinita al yucateca, a pork tenderloin dish complemented by chimichurri sauce and Mayan rice with a sweet corn tamale side dish. My date opted for steak: a \u201csaltado\u201d filet medallion served with onions and deep purple Peruvian potatoes. Both were delicious, though the steak wasn\u2019t quite hot in the center. One of the restaurant\u2019s strengths lies in its unusual and delicate flavors; the chimichurri sauce layered on the cochinita was made with pineapple, and the banana leaf in which the dish was prepared lent all the components a sweet, authentic tang.\nJes\u00fas is still relatively new compared to Evil Czech or Corndance, and rising in popularity; even on a Friday night, the restaurant was filling up, but had less than a five-minute wait. Based on the quality of the experience, however, don\u2019t expect that to last too long.

In Pennsylvania, for instance, which has no women in its 20-member congressional delegation, eight women moved on to the general election from the primaries on Tuesday.\nThe surge in the number of candidates is mostly among Democrats, and of the 60 candidates who have won so far, 52 are Democrats. But that does not make Democrats more likely to win.\nMost of the winners are Democrats in safe Republican districts.\nThe biggest obstacle to getting an even proportion of women in Congress \u2014 they now make up just 20 percent of the total, with 23 women in the Senate and 84 in the House \u2014 is that so many women are running in districts that favor the opposite party.\nThis is particularly true for Democrats. Of the 52 Democrats who have won their primaries, 34 are in districts that are considered solid or likely Republican seats in the general election in November, based on the ratings of three nonpartisan organizations. Just three are Republicans running in districts considered solid or likely Democratic. Those ratings can change, of course, on a whim of news or whiff of scandal.\nAbout half of them face incumbents in November.\nAnother hurdle for women, though, is incumbency. Historically, incumbents almost always win. And the best opportunities for women to win are in open seats \u2014 in 1992, the \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d the House banking scandal had helped prompt a high number of retirements, and therefore open seats.\nMore than half of the women who have won primaries so far \u2014 33 out of 60 \u2014 will be challenging an incumbent in the fall. None of the women challenging an incumbent in the primary \u2014 that is, a member of her own party \u2014 have won so far.\nMany won the primaries by large margins.\nWith so many candidates competing in primaries \u2014 10 candidates in a district has not been unusual this year \u2014 candidates can often win with far less than a majority. But 37 of the women who have won so far won by more than 50 percent of the vote.\nIn Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth District, for instance, Mary Gay Scanlon won with 28.4 percent of the vote, in a 10-way race that featured six women, more than in any other Democratic primary in the nation.\nBut one Republican woman and seven Democrats emerged as general election candidates in the Pennsylvania primaries on Tuesday. Three are in districts that they are favored to win this fall \u2014 and in the Fifth District, two women will now compete in the general: Ms. Scanlon and Pearl Kim, who was unopposed in the Republican primary.\nThat makes Pennsylvania the only state where the minimum number of women who could win the general election is greater than the current number of women serving in the House.\nSources: List of women running for the House was compiled by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers and is as of May "}

It\u2019s encouraging that the proponents of removing of blasphemy as a criminal offense advocated an approach that respects a human rights approach, understanding that blasphemy laws do not protect individuals but rather open the door to abuses.\nThe 2009, Ireland\u2019s Defamation Act struggled to give a more precise definition of the offense. It inserted the requirement that the alleged blasphemer had the intent to cause outrage among a substantial number of a religion\u2019s adherents. This burden of proof makes it difficult to prosecute the offense. The law also makes it necessary to prove that a reasonable person would not find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value in the substance of the alleged blasphemous material.\nHuman Rights First has reported on human rights abuses caused by the use of blasphemy laws around the world. These laws are often vague and can be subject to abuse, either by the authorities or citizens who can accuse a fellow citizen of blasphemy with a personal complaint to the prosecutor. The concept is inconsistent with universal human rights standards, which protect the rights of individuals rather than abstract ideas or religions. In some cases, the penalty of the vaguely drafted laws can be life imprisonment or death\u2014as in Pakistan. Those accused of blasphemy are frequently threatened or attacked even before any investigation. People take to the streets and violence stoked by religious extremists ensues.\nThe argument has been raised in the Irish press and it\u2019s true. Blasphemy laws enable governments to restrict freedom of expression, thought, and religion. Application of the laws can result in devastating consequences for religious minorities. This has been the case for Christians in Pakistan and Egypt, Ahmadi followers in Indonesia, and non-believers in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In many instances, officials fail to condemn abuses or to hold the perpetrators of violence accountable. And the police often fail to stop violence against religious minorities or to protect those endangered on account of such laws. The lack of police response creates a climate in which discrimination and violence proliferate.\nIn the past few years, several bodies of the United Nations have examined the relationship between freedom of expression and hate speech, especially in relation to religious issues. This is important in order to prevent growing violence in the world surrounding the question of blasphemy. After extensive consultation with governments and civil society, also with the active participation of experts around the world and the diplomatic presence of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation, the Rabat Plan of Action was published by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in October 2012. This document outlines how blasphemy laws are seriously problematic. Since 2011, a new process (dubbed the Istanbul Process) was launched as a result of resolutions adopted at the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. The idea is to combat religious intolerance without restricting freedom of speech. This is a the right approach and sorely needed: governments can do"}

The sceptical lot has told us it doesn\u2019t matter. Today will change nothing.\nSo let\u2019s forget about today and look to the future. Say, 2018. There\u2019s a proper election scheduled for then, around late summer.\nThat may seem a while away, but it\u2019s creeping nearer. And, the closer we get to it, a funny thing may be happening.\nFirst, though, conventional wisdom. 2018 will be a two-horse race and the battleground will again be Punjab. PML-N v PTI \u2014 may the best man win.\nBy now, here in 2015, it\u2019s become fairly obvious: the PML-N is about as rubbish at governing as the PPP was.\nPML-N will have the advantage because, well, it\u2019s delivered a bunch of things and Punjab is super fond of Mian Sahib, even if it hasn\u2019t quite warmed to the younger Sharif.\nPTI will have learned from 2013 and will position itself to grab a bunch of seats, but it will still fall short. Ultimately, the party won\u2019t have the machine to move it up from second to first.\nThat\u2019s the conventional wisdom and it seems fairly reasonable. But let\u2019s try something else.\nOne full term and a peaceful transition in 2013 increased the odds of a second full term. So a second full term followed by a peaceful transition in 2018 should make a third consecutive full term even more likely.\n2018 should take us to 2023. And that\u2019s when things start to get a bit complicated. By 2023, if conventional wisdom prevails, Punjab would have been ruled by the PML-N for 15 straight years.\nFifteen years is dictator terrain. Hell, it\u2019s beyond dictator \u2014 Ayub lasted a shade under 11 years, Zia a smidge more than 11, Musharraf just under nine.\nIf Punjab re-elects PML-N in the centre in 2018, it will also have re-re-elected the PML-N in Punjab. Not even a King\u2019s party has managed that.\nAnd that changes the equation a little. In ordinary times, the Punjabi voter would have a straightforward job: decide if a government\u2019s performance over the previous five years means it deserves another five.\nIn PML-N times, in 2018, the voter will also have to figure out if he\u2019s OK with electing what would effectively be a permanent government.\nWhen the military is chucking you in and out and terms aren\u2019t being completed, a two-term prime minister and a three-term CM isn\u2019t such a big deal.\nBut a four-term, two-full-term PM and a five-term, three-consecutive-term CM elected freely and uninterrupted by the public itself \u2014 to be convinced, the voter may want something more.\nSomething more that the PML-N may not have.\nThe PPP knew they were rubbish, didn\u2019t care that they were rubbish, and decided early on to enjoy themselves as much as they could for as long as they could.\nFrom there was born the legend of The Worst Government the Country Has Ever Had, 2008-2013.

{"idx": "36802", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: There's an easy-to-understand reason why the tobacco giant has done so well.\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO) is one of the best-performing stocks of all time. Building on the success of its Marlboro cigarette brand, Altria has gone through huge transformations over the course of its history and faced plenty of threats. Yet when you look at what has made it so successful, as The Wall Street Journal did over the weekend, it really boils down to two things. First, Altria has found a way to survive despite an onslaught of attacks that many believed would eventually drive the tobacco company bankrupt. Second, Altria has used its brand awareness to create pricing power, and price increases have helped the cigarette maker produce growth in revenue and profits even as sales volumes have declined steadily over the years.\nAltria has dealt with threats to its very existence for decades. In the mid-1960s, the first wave of regulation started to affect the tobacco industry, with an official report from the U.S. Surgeon General leading to the imposition of warning labels on cigarette packing. Bans on advertising on television and radio followed by 1970. Slowly but surely, efforts to ban smoking gained momentum. Smoking on airplanes came to an end in 1988 for flights shorter than two hours, and the late 1990s brought smoke-free flights of all lengths.\nMeanwhile, litigation became an even bigger threat. Lawsuits alleging health impacts from smoking were numerous, and Altria and its peers did their best to fend off individual cases. Yet by the late 1990s and early 2000s, many thought that product liability claims might deal the same deathblow to cigarette manufacturers that companies in industries like asbestos manufacturing had suffered. Even though Altria avoided that fate, it and its industry rivals still ended up paying huge settlements to government bodies that put a strain on their profitability.\nHow Altria addressed these threats was interesting. At some points, the company sought to expand its reach, getting into the food business in an effort to diversify its exposure. Yet in the end, investors didn't like the fact that other businesses were effectively penalized by being associated with the core tobacco segment. Spinoffs resulted, leaving Altria highly concentrated in its core U.S. tobacco business and giving shareholders an almost pure play on the success of tobacco going forward.\nThe net impact of negative publicity and anti-smoking efforts has been a dramatic drop in cigarette sales volume. Even as other players in the industry have dropped out or merged, the number of cigarettes sold in the U.S. has dropped by roughly a third over the past dozen years.\nBut what Altria did was to recognize the fact that those customers who chose to remain smokers would be willing to pay more in order to get their favored brands. Even as taxes have risen, Altria has been able to get more revenue per pack of cigarettes. Efforts to be more efficient have also helped boost bottom-line figures, and that growth in turn has contributed to massive share price gains for Altria over time.\nThe question that investors in Altria have to keep at the front of their minds is whether there's a point at which its highly successful strategy will no longer work. Up to a certain point, accepting falling demand in exchange for higher prices can boost profits. But above that key inflection point, price increases could make enough customers stop buying Altria product that it is no longer successful in raising net income. If that happens, then Altria and its peers will have to find another answer or else finally face the downward spiral that so many commentators have expected it to hit long"}

The Peshmerga fought on behalf of the world and we continue this battle,\u201d Sinjari added.\nThe \u201cstrategic\u201d project will not be \u201can easy job\u201d and will take time, he stressed.\nWestern allies and members of the anti-ISIS coalition are assisting the Peshmerga to carry out reforms in order to professionalize the force.\nUS, British, and German military advisers are assisting with the restructuring in a long term plan that will span 10 years.\nBritish Consul General to Erbil Martyn Warr, who hosted Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, said the reform process will be slow, but stressed it will make the Peshmerga independent and self-regulating.\n\u201cThis will take time. There\u2019s a sense that this will all happen tomorrow \u2013 the answer is no. It will take a long time,\u201d Warr told reporters.\nThe focus of the reforms is to modernize the armed forces of the Kurdistan Region to face modern day threats, Warr explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to turn the Peshmerga into a force that is more able to face the threats of today, but also the future. It was not comprehensible for us to imagine the Peshmerga and other forces would face a threat of the sophistication of Daesh [ISIS] over the last few years,\u201d he said.\nAsked whether the UK government will involve Baghdad in the reform process, Warr said it is Erbil that is constitutionally responsible for the Peshmerga.\n\u201cTo a certain extent we\u2019ll be operating with Baghdad, but above all with the Kurdistan Regional Government. That is the government that is formally and constitutionally responsible for Peshmerga affairs, and here is the minister who has that responsibility. We will be working hand-in-hand with the minister,\u201d he said.\nSteve Fagin, the newly appointed US Consul General to Erbil, echoed his British counterpart\u2019s words.\n\u201cThis is critical for the Kurdistan Region to push forward these reforms.

Instead of just looking at grosses (head over to Box Office Mojo for that), Variety took a more subjective approach. We\u2019re breaking down five of 2016\u2019s most surprising or painful flops and five of its most important and impressive hits. It\u2019s more art than accounting. So big hits like \u201cFinding Dory\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d don\u2019t get their due here, and duds like \u201cNine Lives\u201d and \u201cFree State of Jones\u201d get a pass. We were more interested in the sure things that weren\u2019t and the blockbusters that just as easily could have bombed. So without further ado, here\u2019s a look at the year that was, the franchises that were created, and the ones that were snuffed out.\nWhy it Made the List: Ang Lee was riding high after \u201cLife of Pi\u201d captured a best director Oscar and made more than $600 million globally. It makes sense why Sony would jump at the chance to work with the filmmaker, particularly when he had grand plans to push the limits of 3D by shooting in ultra-high frame rates. Unfortunately, his latest effort pleased neither critics nor audiences, many of whom griped that the film had an off-putting telenovela glow. It was in and out of theaters in a matter of weeks and ranks as the biggest bomb of Lee\u2019s career.\nWhy it Made the List: The combination of Steven Spielberg and Roald Dahl was expected to result in a children\u2019s classic. Instead of a new \u201cE.T.,\u201d the film about a big friendly giant was given a massive cold shoulder, losing tens of millions. For Spielberg, who hasn\u2019t had a blockbuster hit since 2008\u2019s \u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\u201d it\u2019s a sign that a filmmaker who once had his finger firmly on pop culture\u2019s pulse, may have lost his feel for the zeitgeist. He\u2019ll try to recapture his mojo with 2018\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d an adaptation of a hit sci-fi novel.\nWhy it Made the List: This is how a franchise dies. The box office returns were so dreadful that Lionsgate, the studio behind the tween series, scrapped plans to make a final film. Instead, it will try to wrap things up with a new television series. It sounds like the studio may have some trouble convincing the stars to make the small screen transition, however.\nWhy it Made the List: This chariot ride pancaked into the side of the coliseum, resulting in a nearly $50 million write down for MGM, one of the studios behind the misbegotten Biblical epic.\nWhy it Made the List: Johnny Depp\u2019s $20 million paychecks probably went up down the rabbit hole along with this money loser.\nWhy it Made the List: The first Star Wars spin-off just proved that a galaxy far, far away is vast enough to support non-Skywalker stories. Star Wars should become an annual moviegoing event, much like the Marvel movies. Get ready for everything from Greedo origin stories to road trip movies about hitting up Tosche Station for some power converters!\nWhy it Made the List: Cue the inevitable sequel!

Called the EeePC, it was a Linux-based clamshell sporting a 7-inch screen. ASUS dubbed it a netbook. The concept has roots in the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project championed by former MIT media director Nicholas Negroponte; the original idea was to create a low-cost PC that would give young people access to the Internet and help kids in emerging markets access the world of information and communication on the Internet.\nBut while the ASUS EeePC was originally designed for emerging markets, ASUS decided to sell it in the U.S. and Europe as well. To everyone's surprise, the gadget took off. The big interest seems to have come from families who already had a PC used by all the members of the house. They wanted a second PC that could deliver Internet connectivity, so the kids wouldn't dominate the family PC.\nThe problem was that many of those who bought this Linux netbook got it home before realizing that it was underpowered and\u0097more important\u0097wouldn't work with their home printers, cameras, and so on. Consequently, sources say that the return rates for the first version of the ASUS EeePC were close to 35 percent. Bottom line was that it did not meet people's expectations. Many of them thought this was just a really low-cost laptop and bought it under that premise.\nRecently, buyers interested in netbooks have started asking ASUS and other vendors to give them a device of the same size and cost\u0097running Windows XP. And that's what's now happening.

It nearly topped that record last quarter.\nAlthough companies are minting money, there's a reason workers may not be feeling a bump in their paychecks: Inflation is heating up.\nReal average hourly earnings -- which factors in inflation -- dropped by 0.2% in July from last year, according to the Labor Department. That's because consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy expenses, jumped in July by the most since September 2008.\nIt's surprising that the low unemployment rate -- it fell to 3.9% in July -- hasn't translated to meaningful wage hikes, outside of select industries like trucking and oil workers.\nAnalysts said companies have navigated the worker shortage by relying on technology and hiring people who have dropped out of the workforce at lower wages.

The study also noted a link with heavier snowfalls, as well as more days of snow.\nThe study was published online yesterday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\"We suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with MI,\" writes Dr. Nathalie Auger, University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, with coauthors. \"Men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. Snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75% of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads.\"\nThe researchers examined data from over 128,000 hospital admissions along with over 68,000 deaths from heart attack (MI) in Quebec from 1981 and 2014. Investigators only evaluated the months of November to April, when snowfall was recorded.\nThe study found that nearly 60% of deaths and hospital admissions due to heart attack were in men, most commonly seen the day after a snowfall. One-third of heart attacks most often occurred the day after a snowfall, with the association also observed after snowfalls lasting two to three days. However, women did not display the elevated risk seen in men.\nThe study noted a 16% increased risk of heart attack following 8 inches of snow , compared with a day that was free of snowfall. In addition, compared to a day devoid of snowfall, men were 1/3 more likely to die of an heart attack the day following 8 inches of snow . Just one day of snow increased the risk of heart attack slightly less than 1%, while elevating the risk of dying from an heart attack by 12%.\n\"Quantity of snowfall was associated with an increased likelihood of hospital admission or death due to MI the following day among men,\" the authors write in their paper. \"The association between snowfall and MI was stronger among men, and weaker or absent among women.\"\nResearchers noted that these findings remained in effect, even after controlling for age, cardiovascular risk factors or other associated health conditions. In general, though, men over the age of 50 who had an elevated risk factor profile for MI, or who were sedentary, were at highest risk if they engaged in shoveling after a heavy snowfall.\nThere were several limitations of the study, including the fact that investigators that did not always record whether snow was shoveled manually or whether a snow blower was used, as well as the dimensions and volume of snow that was removed. In addition, whether snow was pushed or shoveled was also not recorded.\n\"Although these are potentially important considerations, the hypothesis that shoveling is associated with an increased risk of MI events among men remains plausible,\" they write.\nThe increased risk of heart attacks is likely related to"}

CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora reported Cleveland was \"feeling good\" about signing the Pro Bowl safety.\nThe 2018 campaign was the last on Thomas' prior contract, although Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported in March 2018 the Seahawks \"would like to do a long-term deal\" with the safety. That turned out not to be the case, and his departure comes after plenty of off-field headlines.\nDespite those previous developments, Thomas took the field for the Seahawks in the early portion of the 2018 campaign. However, his season was cut short when he fractured his leg in a Week 4 game against the Arizona Cardinals and then made an obscene gesture toward his team's sideline as he was carted off the field.\nAdam Schefter of ESPN cited a source who said the gesture was intended for the organization as a whole and not just head coach Pete Carroll or a specific person after he wasn't traded or given a contract extension before the season.\n\"It also appears as though Thomas' time with the Seahawks is over,\" Schefter wrote at the time. \"They won't have to decide until after this season, but the Seahawks are not expected to use their franchise tag on Thomas this winter, allowing him to leave Seattle, league sources told ESPN.\"\nThe former Texas Longhorn also made waves after Seattle's Christmas Eve win over the Dallas Cowboys in the 2017 season when he went toward the Dallas locker room and told Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett, \"If ya'll have the chance, come get me,\" per Jon Machota of the Dallas Morning News.\nHe discussed the Cowboys moment in the aforementioned video with Slater, explaining he was a fan of the team growing up.\nThe drama defined some of Thomas' latter tenure with the Seahawks, but it doesn't change the fact Baltimore is getting one of the best safeties of his generation. He is a six-time Pro Bowler and three-time First Team All-Pro selection and will be only 30 years old throughout the 2019 campaign, suggesting there could still be prime production to come even after a serious injury.\nThe Ravens have been hit hard by departures on defense already this offseason. Linebacker Za'Darius Smith reportedly agreed to a deal with the Green Bay Packers, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. C.J. Mosley will sign with the New York Jets, per Rapoport.\nBringing in Thomas fills the safety void left when Baltimore released Eric Weddle last week.\nThomas has 28 career interceptions as a ball-hawking safety but also brings a hard-hitting presence at the back end of the defense. He helped the Seahawks win Super Bowl 48 and reach Super Bowl 49 and will look to help his new team to its first playoff win since the 2014 season."}

It\u2019s a lovely idea, wittily done, and its warmth is a welcome respite from the grisly Victorian police procedural.\nKidd\u2019s research is worn lightly, with occasional real names dropped in for orientation, such as the doctor Elizabeth Garrett or the menagerie owner Jamrach of Ratcliff Highway. But her imagination rides wild, in tightly controlled prose. Her concision makes the book feel like a high-pressure jar, stuffed with frightening specimens including a knife-wielding rogue surgeon. Is there any more chilling phrase for a sham doctor to stutter out than \u201cI wanted to see inside her\u201d?\nThat most handed-down of tropes, the mermaid, is refreshed here into a merrow, a magical creature who affects the weather and the emotions of all who look on her.

And that regulatory loopholes and shoddy enforcement of employment laws are leaving these workers vulnerable to burnout and abuse.\nRoughly one fifth of workers in Ontario have precarious jobs, according to the report -- that is, jobs that provide \"low wages or insufficient hours of work, few or no benefits, little job security and minimal control over their work conditions.\" They've counted in that number anyone whose job (or combination of jobs) earns them less than 1.5 times the minimum wage, plus two or more of the following criteria: no pension, no union and small firm size.\nPrecarious jobs are most common in food services, hotels, agriculture and service industries such as repair, maintenance, laundry, personal care, and business and building support services.\nWhat is so worrying about precarious work, the report points out, is not only the growing proportion of workers who depend on it, but the fact that they're increasingly stuck in this kind of work for years on end. An entry-level position leading to better jobs down the line has become an out-of-date fantasy for many.\n-Increasing employer and employee awareness of workers' existing rights under the Employment Standards Act, and improving the province's enforcement of those oft-ignored standards.\n-Changes to the Employment Standards Act to better protect workers in precarious jobs.\n-Awareness, enforcement and reforms to workplace health and safety legislation.\n-Reform and improvement of provincial training and education programs.\nFor the Wynne government not to act swiftly on most or all of the report's recommendations, but rather to cherry pick a few of the easiest while ignoring the rest would be a shameful exercise in heel-dragging.\n-giving all workers entitlement to 10 days of emergency personal medical leave per year (a right currently denied in workplaces with 50 or fewer employees).\nOn the trickier ones -- those requiring a substantial injection of public funding, or likely to provoke howls of protest from employers -- the LCO recommends more study of the options.\nFor instance, on the question of requiring employers to pay part-time workers at the same rate as full-time employees doing the same work, the LCO says the government should \"consider what amendments could be made to the ESA\" in this respect.\nOn the minimum wage -- which the government has frozen since 2010, with a yet-to-be-fulfilled promise that it would \"appoint a committee\u2026 to provide advice on the minimum wage in advance of the 2012 budget\" -- the LCO advises simply that this committee be convened. No call here to actually increase the minimum wage or index it to inflation, as other provinces have done.\nThe report also discusses the possibility of creating a system to provide health benefits to the many workers currently without coverage, for instance through a mandatory, multi-employer funded system similar to the WSIB.

This week I read that the archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, announced that if employees want to keep their jobs as teachers in Catholic schools in Britain, they should not marry divorcees, or get married in registry offices, or enter into any other kind of legal civil ceremonies (such as civil partnerships) that do not meet with the Catholic Church\u2019s approval.\nApart from its bracing fundamentalism, that directive is remarkable for its cruelty. Does the archbishop actually believe there is such a surfeit of love in this world that we can cheerfully prescribe how we encounter it?\nThis stark directive from the archbishop takes aim at both heterosexuals and homosexuals and tells them bluntly that falling for a divorcee or marrying in a borough hall or signing a civil union will not only be disapproved of, it will now get them fired.\nWell that\u2019s tidy, isn\u2019t it? Just conform to the church\u2019s increasingly rigid interpretation of the gospel and make the life choice to say goodbye to the person you happen to love.\nIt\u2019s what Jesus would ask of you, we feel certain. Who could possibly object to that?\nI object, but I know there are a lot of people who feel differently. There are many people who put fidelity to an idea, or faith in a theology, over the untidy realities of our daily lives.\nThey prefer biting rules to wiggle room. They reject what the poet Michal Longley calls the drunkenness of things being various in favor of the sobriety of a command.\nThese people fascinate me.

Saying no, that is, to the very thing that will save them.\nBecause their salvation came at the wrong time, or because the person that offered it was the wrong race, or they had the wrong social or religious background, or the wrong gender, or they once said the wrong thing.\nSaying no to life, saying no to love, is no small thing. It takes very considerable effort.\nIt is an exceptionally hard bargain that many people make in anticipation of a later reward (perhaps as late as after life).

Actually almost all of the property was located in Hillsborough \u2013 just a small 2-foot strip was in Manville.\nA few years earlier, Mr. Utasi became aware of the fact that Brooks Boulevard had been extended through his property, Apparently, that right of way had been there since 1925, but had only recently been improved. That fact was of no comfort to Mr. Utasi. By 1964, he was demanding the return of his property and the removal of the road.\nWhen Hillsborough and Manville declined to return the property, Mr. Utasi had another idea. He would give up his rights to the disputed land if Manville would annex ALL of his property. He believed he had a deal, but a year later nothing had been done.\nAt this point, he decided to take another course of action. He woke up one morning at his home on Seventh Street (I believe he still lives there today), and got some dirt. Forty-five tons of dirt to be precise \u2013 which he proceeded to dump on Brooks Boulevard in the vicinity of 2oth Avenue. He erected a sign which read \u201cPrivate Property \u2013 No Trespassing\u201d.\nThere is no report on the reaction of the residents of the new Village Green development, but they couldn\u2019t have been very pleased. Hillsborough and Manville officials were also not pleased \u2013 Brooks Boulevard was then, as it is now, a main link between the towns \u2013 and quickly got a court order for the removal of the dirt.\nJoseph Utasi was charged with obstructing a public street by depositing debris \u2013 which must certainly be the wildest case of understatement in Hillsborough judicial history!\nPosted in Uncategorized on June 9, 2010 by Greg Gillette.\nToday\u2019s Weird, Wild, and Wicked story takes us back to 1926.

After moving to New York to work at Parsons The New School for Design, Gunn began to cultivate a new curriculum for the school in 1999, changing a program that, at the time, still dated back to the original curriculum from 1953. Gunn felt it was a necessity to change with the times and continue to evolve, especially in the clothing industry.\nFashion is a financial commodity and can fluctuate vastly depending on the state of its present economy. With the shift of manufacturing from the United States to foreign countries like China, production has become cheaper than ever and in turn has affected the quality of the clothing we purchase. Gunn feels it will affect how we make purchases in the future.\nDue to the craze of inexpensive stores like H&M, local fashion could be on the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so incredibly wasteful and it\u2019s flicking along with everything so quickly, I think in a way you\u2019re going to start to see a little development toward slow fashion like slow food in response to sort of the \u2018McDonaldization\u2019 of the world,\u201d Steele said.\nAnne Thornton, 32, admired the panelists\u2019 honesty.\nAmberly Hilsinki, 31, also commented on how genuine the speakers were in their open conversation."}

Royals said the fee increases are expected to generate $294,237 in yearly revenue that will go toward filling the vacancies.\n\"My projection is that the fees will cover the salaries of the folks we're looking for,\" Royals told the board Thursday morning. \"With the building industry the way it is, the higher the boon, the harder it is for us to hire outside folks.\"\nRoyals said the county will have a public hearing on the fee increases in September with the aim that the new fees take effect on Oct. 1.\nThe approximate average increase of $89 is based on a 2,500-square-foot, single-family home. But the higher fees would also apply to any development that requires a building permit \u2014 from new construction to remodeling to the installation of plumbing, electrical, mechanical or gas, Royals said.\nThe county currently charges $1,015.94 for a building permit for a 2,500-square-foot single-family home, according to Royals. The proposed increase would bump up the fee to $1,104.91 for that size residence.\nTo compare, Escambia County charges $1,190.78 for that building permit, and Okaloosa County charges $1,644.28.\nCounty permit fees have not been increased since 2015 with only some of the residential fees being adjusted at that time.\nRoyals added she will work with County Administrator Dan Schebler on a comprehensive review of what inspectors could earn in the county.\nThe current starting inspector salary in Santa Rosa County is $13.54 an hour compared with $14.54 in Escambia County and $16.25 in Okaloosa County.

Jiaying is running away from her British boyfriend in Europe and Judy from her abusive Chinese boyfriend she met while studying in Tokyo. While Judy relates memories of her boyfriend, Zhou, Jiaying comes to terms with events in her past that led her to wander the world aimlessly.\nTranslated into English by Wang Xinlin and Poppy Toland earlier this year, the original Chinese text was published in 2002 by journalist and documentary filmmaker Shih Chiung-yu (\u5e2b\u74ca\u745c). Allusions to a new millennium brimming with the promise of economic prosperity are interspersed throughout the novel: Internet cafes are portrayed as hubs connecting global citizens. Descriptions of old streets mixed with sparkling skyscrapers in Asian capitals such as Taipei, Seoul and Tokyo, embody the perennial conflict of reconciling tradition with modernity.\nWang and Toland do a good job at interpreting the narrative voice, particularly Jiaying\u2019s matter-of-fact attitude. When Judy recounts her story, Jiaying thinks to herself: \u201cperhaps being in a new environment had taught me to just observe and say nothing.\u201d She listens to Judy\u2019s ramblings and offers no opinions, just as she used to listen to her father\u2019s stories of fighting alongside the Chinese Nationalists in World War II and his subsequent exile to Taiwan, and tales of her uncle\u2019s exploits fighting for the US army during the Korean War.\nShih\u2019s own family history is embedded in the novel.

The congressman from Michigan, a Republican first elected in 2010, had just been removed from the budget committee, a long-delayed comeuppance for his opposition to the Paul Ryan budget. (Like many libertarians, he didn\u2019t think it went far enough.) He talked freely to reporters about the snub. After the new Congress was sworn in, Amash joined a crew of conservatives to vote against John Boehner for Speaker of the House. Amash was famous\u2014and among establishment Republicans, notorious. \u201cEven I\u2019m sick of seeing myself in the paper,\u201d he told a reporter.\nNot that sick, though. By the summer, Amash had normalized relations with his leadership and won a vote on an amendment to defund the NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance. When the amendment nearly passed, it altered the way official Washington discussed the NSA, changing the story from senators vs. Snowden to an actual controversy that ran through party lines. Three months later, the 33-year old congressman drew a wealthy and establishment-friendly Republican primary challenger. This was covered as a problem for the Tea Party, but it seemed awfully selective. Of all the \u201cunreasonable\u201d Republicans to go after, the one sweating a challenge was the libertarian who explained his votes on Facebook.\nI talked to Amash about the year that was and how he expects 2014 to play out.\nDavid Weigel: Your biggest legislative coup this year was a loss\u2014the NSA amendment that went down narrowly. You\u2019re bringing it up again in 2014. Why would it go differently next time?\nJustin Amash: Well, things are going great. The recent court ruling, and the recent push by many of the tech companies puts things firmly on our side going forward. Actually, I\u2019ve heard from many people about their votes next time, and one of the more prominent members of Congress who\u2019s changed his mind on this is Chairman [of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Darrell] Issa. As he\u2019s learned more about it, he\u2019s come to the conclusion that the NSA has to reform the way it operates.\nDW: How did this week\u2019s NSA decision move the votes?\nJA: What I took out of the court ruling was that it emphasized a lot of the points that I\u2019ve been making over the past several months\u2014that in the modern era, if the third party doctrine is applied as it was applied in Smith v.

Under a plan announced last November by President Nicolas Sarkozy, those caught sharing copyrighted content via P2P would have their Internet access cut off under a three-strikes-and-you're-offline scheme.\nJean Berbinau, general secretary of French regulatory body Autorit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation des Mesures Techniques (Regulatory Authority for Technical Measures), said that legislation enacting Sarkozy's plan should be passed by summer. \"We have to do something, but it is only transitional, only to give time to the industry to adapt and maybe to encourage a new business model,\" Berbinau said at the MIDEM music trade show, according to the Financial Times.\nNew business models have already begun appearing without much in the way of help from the French government. DRM is on life-support at Sony and is dead at the other three major labels. Amazon has announced plans to take its DRM-free MP3 store international, and it's possible to listen to just about any song you want via Last.fm's new free streaming service.\nThat's not stopping France from moving ahead with its plan, which would require ISPs to invest heavily to stay on top of P2P traffic and begin playing the role of copyright police. French ISPs will have to begin monitoring their networks for illegal traffic, which will require additional investments in DPI equipment as well as additional administrative overhead. Those costs are, in turn, likely to be passed on to their subscribers.\nUnsurprisingly, the IFPI is a big fan of France's plans to turn ISPs into copyright police. \"This is the single most important initiative to help win the war on online piracy that we have seen so far,\" said IFPI CEO John Kennedy when the plan was first announced. \"By requiring ISPs to play a role in the fight against piracy, President Sarkozy has set an example to others of how to ensure that the creative industries remain strong in difficult markets so that they can remain major economic and cultural contributors to society.\"\nThe IFPI would love to see other countries follow France's example. In its 2008 report on digital music, the trade group called on ISPs around the world to take up the mantle of content filtering. 2007 was the year ISP responsibility started to become an accepted principle,\" said the group. \"2008 must be the year it become [sic] reality.\"\nIf it does indeed become a reality in France this summer, French 'Net users will have to learn to accept the inevitable loss in privacy that goes with having one's traffic monitored by ISPs."}

Now these are issues that all countries will have to deal with. I think that because of my experience, I am in a good position to deal with these issues,\" he added.\nSpecifically on the issue of the current high price of oil, the British leader says he would like to see OPEC boost production.\n\"I believe there is capacity to do so,\" said Brown. \"I believe there are many oil producers around the world who could look what they can do. But of course we have also got to have a forward-looking plan because the oil price now is being affected by what people see as the likely outcomes a few years ahead and if supply is going to be lower than demand for future years, then we need to act now to convince people that more oil can be made available.\"\n\"So, that is what the discussions between consumers and producers in oil has got to be about.

NEK is to keep a majority share of 51%, while Rosatom is also expected to have a share of 25%.\nSerbia has expressed interest in acquiring a share of 5%-10% but the talks for that have not been finalized yet.\nAfter it was first started in the 1980s, the construction of Bulgaria's second nuclear power plant at Belene on the Danube was stopped in the early 1990s over lack of money and environmental protests.\nAfter selecting the Russian company Atomstroyexport, a subsidiary of Rosatom, to build a two 1000-MW reactors at Belene and signing a deal for the construction, allegedly for the price of EUR 3.997 B, with the Russians during Putin's visit to Sofia in January 2008, in September 2008, former Prime Minister Stanishev gave a formal restart of the building of Belene.

That process was launched in February after a former engineer, Susan Fowler, published a horrifying account of life in an organization in which sexual discrimination and harassment were accepted, even glorified, as part of the landscape.\nYet the report by Holder and his law partner Tammy Albarran is merely a roster of 47 recommendations for fixing Uber\u2019s dysfunctional management and employee culture. It doesn\u2019t come close to addressing the company\u2019s real problems.\nPeople with a serious interest in seeing that happen are unimpressed. Fowler\u2019s tweeted response was, \u201cIt\u2019s all optics.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten nothing but aggressive hostility from them\u201d since her account was published.\nThese are more fundamental than the atmosphere in the conference rooms and hallways, and raise real questions about its putative, and dubious, $70-billion valuation as a private company. They involve, first, essential questions about the economics of a company that still hasn\u2019t demonstrated a path to profitability (see the analysis by transportation expert Hubert Horan here), but lives on the sufferance of its venture capital financiers. Uber, still a private company, has been giving the public a peek at its financials, which are swathed in red; last month it reported a loss in the first quarter of $708 million on revenue of $2.4 billion, which were both better than the previous quarter. But the company hasn\u2019t released year-over-year comparisons, which would be more revealing.\nThen there\u2019s its relationship with its drivers who actually make its business go. There are an estimated 200,000 of them worldwide, compared with the approximately 12,000 engineers and support staff who work in Uber offices.\nOne almost wants to pity poor Uber. Almost.\nNone of this is encouraging, especially the Holder report\u2019s focus on Uber\u2019s internal policies, when the company also needs to rework its external relationships, says Catherine Bracy, executive director of the Bay Area\u2019s TechEquity Collaborative. That includes \u201crethinking how it treats its drivers, taking a more collaborative approach to working with government, developing deep and trusted partnerships with communities, or developing other better business practices,\u201d Bracy told me by email.\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start in examining the ways that Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick blew it during his painfully documented confrontation with an Uber driver on Feb. 5 over falling fares. But let\u2019s try.\nThe Holder report\u2019s recommendations are mostly cosmetic changes to hiring and human resources procedures, board structures, \u201ccultural values,\u201d etc., etc. \u201cIncrease the profile of Uber\u2019s head of diversity,\u201d \u201ccreate an oversight committee\u201d of the board (isn\u2019t \u201coversight\u201d the board\u2019s whole job?), \u201cdevote adequate staff and resources to Human Resources\u201d \u2014 these are ideas that come right off the \u201c20 ways to make yourself a better manager\u201d bookshelf.

Yet as basic as these ingredients are, the results can vary tremendously because the components can be treated in so many ways. What kind of tomatoes are used, and should they be chopped, sliced or pureed? How much moisture, fat and salt should the cheese contain? Should it be sliced or grated? And bakers can go on for hours about what makes their dough distinctive and special.\nIn New York, pizzas tend to fall into three categories: classic New York pizzas, with crisp, thin, smoky crusts and traditional toppings; street pizzas, which are mass-produced and sold by the slice or for delivery, and for lack of a better term, nouvelle pizzas, which include those personal pizzas made in wood-burning ovens in upscale Italian restaurants, as well as California-style pizzas that use unconventional combinations of ingredients. In some ways, this last category is truest to the pizzas served in Italy.\nClassic New York pizzas have made a comeback after decades in decline, and more and more restaurants are offering nouvelle pizzas. Here are two fairly new places where the pizzas are outstanding.\nLuca Lounge, which opened a month or so ago on Avenue B near 13th Street, offers evidence, if more is needed, of the encroaching gentrification of Alphabet City. On a block where drug dealers and gunshots were once considered routine, prosperous young men and women, still wearing their office suits, now arrive at this rollicking bar and lounge at 10 P.M. But you can find tranquillity in the big, pretty garden on two levels in the rear and in the narrow, paneled dining room.\nYou can also find a selection of excellent antipasto, served individually or in family portions, and little pizzas or, as the menu calls them, pizzettes. Tomato bruschetta ($4, $8), chopped tomatoes, dressed in basil and fine olive oil, atop crisp slices of toast, are somewhat redundant when pizza is ordered, but tasty nonetheless.\nBuffalo mozzarella ($5, $10) is a little too firm, but well flavored, served with sliced tomatoes in the same olive oil and basil. Salads are terrific, especially radicchio with tuna, olives and tomatoes ($7, $14), and spinach with pecorino cheese and sweet green apples ($5, $10).\nPizzas come in one size, about 10 inches in diameter, which is just enough for one person. The crusts are wafer thin and very crisp, with a small choice of traditional toppings. I especially liked the margherita ($7), cheese and tomato with basil, and the quattro stagioni ($9), in which the pizzette is divided in quadrants and topped with cheese, artichoke hearts, olives and mushrooms.\nWhile the Luca Lounge atmosphere is up to the minute, Mona Lisa Gourmet Pizza on Bleecker Street is more traditional, a bright shop with pizzas displayed in plastic cases and a few seats scattered around. The only thing untraditional is the pizza.\nJoseph Viggiano, the chef and owner, makes an extraordinarily light crust, which is airy yet crisp and tasty.

If more new revenue isn't generated, or benefits aren't cut, the program will burn through its cash reserves in less than two decades, which would necessitate a 21% cut in benefits for it to stay solvent. This is a point that few would dispute, and a Social Security \"fix\" is among the hot-button topics of this year's presidential elections.\nThe problems with Social Security can aptly be summed up in three points.\nFirst, Americans are living longer than ever before. Improvements in medicine, diagnostics, and health education have increased the average life expectancy by almost nine years over the past five decades, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People living longer than ever means they'll be drawing Social Security benefit checks for longer.\nSecondly, the baby boomers are entering retirement at a pace of roughly 10,000 people per day. There simply aren't enough new workers coming into the labor force to replace the number leaving it, causing the worker-to-beneficiary ratio to fall. As that ratio continues to decline, the amount of revenue coming in via payroll taxes will grow smaller compared to the amount being paid out to beneficiaries.\nFinally, Americans just really don't have a good comprehension of how Social Security works. MassMutual Financial Group gave a 10-question Social Security quiz to 1,513 people, and only 28% received a passing grade (seven or more correct answers), while just one person answered all 10 questions correctly. If people don't understand the program, then its less likely they're making financially sound decisions about things such as to when to file for benefits.\nBut there may be even more to worry about according to a recent report from The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL.\nBased on TSCL's estimations, a whopping 56% of Social Security households could owe some degree of federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits for the 2015 tax season. That's a problem because seniors don't often take into account the potential tax implications of crossing an exemption threshold after they retire.\nAs TSCL notes in its report, the income thresholds for taxing Social Security haven't been adjusted since (drum roll please...) 1983. What was once described as a tax that would affect only the top income-earners (or roughly 10% of Social Security recipients) is now on pace to affect well over half of the households receiving Social Security in 2015.\nPer the Social Security Administration and IRS, individual income below $25,000 is exempt from taxation. For individuals earning $25,000 to $34,000 per year, up to 50% of Social Security benefits may be taxed. For individuals with incomes above $34,000, up to 85% of their Social Security benefits are taxable.\nThe ranges are progressive for couples as well. Income below $32,000 for joint-filers is exempt, whereas income between $32,000 and $44,000 may require a tax on up to 50% of Social Security"}

Another soldier near him awoke, complaining about U.S. Navy pilots flying maneuvers so early in the morning.\nHis complaint was cut short by a tremendous explosion, Heim recalled from his home in Pennsylvania earlier this week.\n\"I saw another airplane coming down, and something dropped down from underneath it. Then there was another explosion,\" he said, adding, \"I saw a big red ball.\"\nHeim tried three times to run to his duty post but each time was strafed by enemy machine gunfire and forced to turn back.\nWhen he finally reached his post in one of the base hangars, a bomb blew through the ceiling and slammed him against a wall.\n\"When I come to, I was on all fours, crawling along the wall,\" he said. \"Blood was coming out of somewhere. It scared me to death. I thought I was dying.\"\nHeim managed to grab a machine gun and ran outside, where he began shooting at Japanese aircraft overhead.\n\"I could feel the bullets hitting the plane and smelled smoke,\" he said.\nHe recalls the ordeal lasting more than an hour, a time that is etched in his memory.\n\"The attack, to me, is like yesterday,\" Heim said.\nHeim went on to train as a pilot and flew 78 combat missions during the war, some of them over the Balkans, France and Germany. He piloted missions in Korea and later flew for the Strategic Air Command.\nWhen he left the military, the Lykens, Pennsylvania native returned home and found a job as a lineman for Bell Telephone. He retired in 1983.\nHe and his wife, Kay, who have a son and daughter, have been married for 70 years.\nThe Associated Press reports that about 3,000 people are expected to gather at Pearl Harbor on Saturday to commemorate the anniversary of the 1941 Japanese attack that launched the U.S. into World War II.\nAbout 70 World War II veterans and survivors of the Dec. 7 bombing plan to attend the morning ceremony on the shore overlooking a memorial to the USS Arizona battleship that sank during the attack.\nThe event will begin with a traditional Hawaiian blessing. There will be a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the minute the bombing began 72 years ago."}

It's a rare thing that happen to games for a number of reasons; usually it's in relation to a game feature not being implemented properly, or being a bad port, or some anti-consumer measure taken by the developers. In this case, it's a bit more complex and nuanced than some other review bombing situations. The short gist of it is that some Chinese gamers are angry about having to pay extra to access proxies in order to reduce their latency because there are no Chinese game servers.\nOver on the official Steam store page you'll quickly notice that the overall review rating has gone from positive down to mixed. The histogram at the bottom of the page shows a huge spike in negative reviews -- as of the writing of this article there are more than 22,000 negative reviews logged since September 28th, 2017, many of which are from Chinese gamers.\nWith the recent update from Valve, it shows that the negative reviews (also known as review bombing) are in response to two things: the first issue is the ongoing problem of \"stream sniping,\" where players are accused of and banned for allegedly watching a live-stream on Twitch of someone playing the game and then killing the streamer in the game after figuring out their position. Plenty of players are complaining in the reviews about being banned for stream-sniping, and claiming that this is hurting the gameplay of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds due to streamers getting a say-so on who is stream-sniping.\nThe second major problem is more of a service issue. Thousands upon thousands of Chinese players have complained to Bluehole about paid proxies in order to reduce latency. What makes this so bad is that some players are complaining that the cost of the proxies to limit the lag is about the same price as the game itself, but they only gain access to the proxies for about four months at a time. So, third-parties are making money on the recurring fees required for Chinese players to play on the same servers as those in the U.S. and in Europe since there are no official Chinese servers for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds at the moment.\nThings escalated even further when the beta update went live for Steam gamers on September 26th, making it so players are unable to choose their region of preference and there's an added in-game advertisement for Chinese players to purchase an \"official\" proxy accelerator. Many of the players feel this is insulting because they've already paid for the game and now they're being advertised a proxy that will help net them decent ping when playing against Americans and Europeans.\nThe real issue here is that many Chinese gamers playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds are angry that there are no official servers for their region, and yet they're being goaded into paying extra just to play the game with any sort of decent ping. It really is an unfortunate situation.\nThe bigger question is, obviously, why there are no official Chinese servers or servers dedicated to Asia? A lot of complaints centering around the proxies and the in-game proxy ads would be alleviated with dedicated regional servers. This is especially egregious given that many players are also still complaining about a lack of proper optimization and performance, so they're essentially paying twice to play the game and still aren't receiving a top-tier gameplay experience.\nAs for the issue with the stream-sniping... well, I'm not sure exactly how Bluehole can resolve that problem, but it doesn"}

A mile east of the Strip, off Flamingo Road, the center consists of 10 office buildings, 1.4 million square feet of space and several restaurants.\nBig-money office sales are rare these days in Las Vegas, one of the worst office markets in the country.\nThe most recent major transaction was last fall, when mall owner General Growth Properties sold 32 office buildings in Summerlin to Hines Interests and Oaktree Capital Management for about $120 million. The buildings reportedly were half vacant at the time.\nBlackstone, one of the largest investment firms in the world, said it is acquiring Hughes Center through its Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII fund. Subsidiary Equity Office Properties will manage it.\nThis is the fourth time in the past decade that the complex has changed hands.\n\u201cWe see this as a tremendous opportunity,\u201d Frank Campbell, Southern California managing director for Equity Office, said in a news release.\nThough it is widely viewed as Las Vegas\u2019 top office park, given its high-quality buildings and prominent tenants, the center\u2019s vacancy rate is on par with the rest of the valley.\nSouthern Nevada had a 22.7 percent office vacancy rate in the second quarter this year, compared to 7.9 percent in 2006 during the real estate bubble, according to Colliers International.\nThe Hughes Center is 22 percent vacant, according to data provided by Randy Hall, a spokesman for the new management. When Crescent bought it roughly 10 years ago, the property was almost fully leased with a 2.3 percent vacancy rate, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows.\nThis is not Blackstone\u2019s first foray into the valley. The New York company has spent billions acquiring and fixing up homes in markets battered by the recession, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Southern California\u2019s Inland Empire.\nLately, though, the firm has tapered back on home purchases locally amid skyrocketing prices.\nCrescent, based in Fort Worth, Texas, acquired the Hughes Center in phases in late 2003 and the first half of 2004 for $242.5 million. In 2007, shortly before the real estate market crashed, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley bought Crescent for $6.5 billion, taking control of its then-portfolio of 54 office buildings nationwide.\nWithin a few years, Morgan Stanley had lost almost $1 billion on the deal and was about to default on the $2 billion loan from Barclays that had financed the buyout, according to news reports.\nIn fall 2009, the company essentially handed over the keys: Barclays teamed with Goff to take control of Crescent and its 17 million square feet of office holdings."}

But today, in India, even though we constantly keep talking about woman empowerment, it\u2019s true that majority of women take a backseat when it comes to managing money or involving themselves in making financial decisions. They often let the male members of their family, be husbands, brothers or fathers, take the lead or show the way.\nThis is an issue with most of the women, working and non-working. They often fear not having enough knowledge about the various financial avenues available or suffer from the fear of not making the right decisions. There have been instances when women have been left mystified over unforeseen events in the family. Hence, experts suggest that the best way for women to get more responsible with finances would be through self education or approaching a trusted expert to learn about basic financial concepts.\nFinancial literacy is a must. If you are a homemaker and confused on from where to start, relax. With the help of various tools, calculators, blogs and vast information available online, on various investment avenues, you could collect as much as information possible and later discuss with your financial expert for better understanding of products.\nIt\u2019s true that women can meticulously manage household budgets and keep a tab on spending. If you draw a budget of the household needs, pen down liabilities or loans, if any, keep track of short term and long term financial needs, including an emergency fund, you can easily save for the future. Experts suggest that one step at a time, keeping a target in mind, would help in getting personal finances in place. Child\u2019s education, retirement planning could be some of the goals targeted.\nTypically, the risk taking capacity, goals and objectives is definitely different for women who are married, unmarried, parenting a single child and so on. But, by and large, women are more comfortable with saving instruments that yield fixed returns. At the same time, a health insurance and a term insurance is a must. Experts believe that women who plan to invest in gold should look at investing in gold based funds instead of opting for gold ornaments. While married women may be in a better position to invest in products that are not entirely risk-free, because they have a second income from their spouse that may not be the case with a single parent who may also need to factor in the future security for herself and her dependents and hence may invest into extremely safe products."}

There she was, at the tender age of 13, singing \"Crush on You,\" \"You Got It All\" and other hits with the Wolfgramm family band, the Jets.\nRemember the Jets? Those eight brothers and sisters of Tongan descent who used the Twin Cities as a launching pad to major pop stardom in the 1980s?\nTwenty-five years after signing with MCA Recordings and after a decade of bitter feelings, the Jets are reuniting for a concert Friday in Minneapolis. The mayor has declared it \"Jets Day\" in the Mill City.\n\"I wanted the family to bury the hatchet,\" said Moana, 37, the second youngest Jet and now its chief pilot. \"We all have kids now. I wanted to do a show in Minneapolis because that's where we were discovered, and everyone will show up for a family reunion.\"\nThere was enough bickering, bitterness and bad vibes in the Wolfgramm family to fill an episode of \"VH1's Behind the Music.\" The siblings, ages 11 to 20 when they landed their big-time record contract, scored five Top 10 hits, had a song in \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" and performed at the White House and the World Series. But over time, the Jets, breadwinners for their family of 19, were frustrated by how little money they realized from the $12 million the band grossed between 1985 and '90, and how much their manager made. The band filed for bankruptcy and fired their high-profile manager, Don Powell. The Wolfgramm family left Minnesota in the mid-1990s, with various members landing in Utah, California, Arizona and Hawaii.\n\"The music almost tore us apart. The business took over and the gigs were more important than our relationships,\" Moana said recently from Provo, Utah. \"Liz, when she was diagnosed with [breast] cancer, just walked away from the music. We were like 20 -- when kids are almost finishing college -- and we were like burnt-out, has-been music artists.\"\nAfter Liz and Moana exited, the Wolfgramm boys continued with a new crew of younger sisters on vocals, even trying to plug into the teen-pop world in Orlando as JETT17.

The Lowdown: An unfailingly pleasant little comedy that would benefit from more conflict and a sharper tone, but it's a proven crowd-pleaser that will play well to food and food-truck aficionados.\nStarring: Jon Favreau, John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara, Emjay Anthony, Bobby Cannavale, Oliver Platt, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey, Jr.\nMuch has been made over Jon Favreau returning to his indie roots with Chef, and, of course, if you\u2019re comparing the film to an Iron Man outing, then, yeah, it\u2019s pretty indie. But with 20-plus credited producers, executive producers, co-producers and associate producers \u2014 not to mention a cast of famous names \u2014 it\u2019s clearly on the high-end of indie-ness. The result, in any case, is a small, consistently pleasant movie with a degree of charm. It\u2019s a film that is almost impossible to dislike. It has nice characters, good production values, lots of lovingly photographed and appetizing food \u2014 and almost no dramatic tension. This isn\u2019t the movie\u2019s only problem, but it\u2019s the one that keeps it, for me, from being anything more than pleasant. It just never feels like there\u2019s anything really at stake here, making it hard to be all that invested in the characters. Pleasant only takes you so far. At least, it only takes me so far, because a lot of folks seem to love Chef. That\u2019s a leap I can\u2019t make.

(Bear in mind, a critic just made that assessment.) And like the animated film, it requires the viewer to adapt to certain lapses in reality, especially as concerns business permits, food truck regulations and child labor laws \u2014 any one of which might have profitably offered the film a degree of genuine conflict in its particularly meandering second half. Also, not in its favor is Chef\u2019s heavy leaning on social media in general and Twitter in particular (to the point of product placement) \u2014 things that will one day make the movie seem quaint, and not in a good way.\nFavreau stars as upscale chef Carl Casper, who is also a workaholic, divorced dad. (The workaholic aspect is essential for any neglectful movie dad.) Carl is at loggerheads with his boss (Dustin Hoffman) who insists he stick to the tried-and-true menu \u2014 a stance that causes Carl to be raked over the coals by big-noise food blogger Ramsey Michel (Platt). After becoming involved in a Twitter war with Michel, Carl promises to show him a new menu if he\u2019ll come back, but the boss nixes this, demanding the same old thing. Unsurprisingly, Carl quits to strike out on his own. (Any similarity to Favreau breaking away from making big-budget blockbusters with this little film are hardly coincidental.)

Those money-oozing decisions seemingly paid out in most cases, though not so much in others.\nHere are the 7 most expensive TV series in the 80+ years that the small screen medium has been putting out programming. Try not to have your bank statements and/or past due bills anywhere around while reading, and note that in some cases, the budget reported represents the years at peak costs, and not necessarily the cost for the entire run.\nLana and Lilly Wachowski were known for spending oodles of money on feature film projects - Speed Racer costs $120 million, and none of it spent on actual speed - so it was no surprise that their first TV venture on the boundary-free Netflix was so very far from cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. But unlike the mass amounts of CGI infused into the Wachowskis' Matrix films, Sense8 broke the bank because the production took place almost solely on location, with nine different world metros serving as the settings. The octo-narrative approach may not sit with everyone, but no one can deny how beautiful Sense8 is.\nIf one describes something as \"an HBO drama based on Julius Caesar's depictions of the The Great Roman Civil War\" out loud, then the soft cha-ching sound of a cash register can be heard just behind whoever is listening. Rome indeed gave off the impression that no expense was spared in creating TV's most realized version of 1st Century B.C.E. Unfortunately, the intricate set design, masterful costumes, and vast ensemble cast was a bit too much for HBO and the BBC to take in the face of those astonishing costs, and the largely well-received Rome did not last beyond its initial two-season order.\nWith a fanbase that forms a vocal wall around most other series on the small screen - mostly to the North - Game of Thrones rarely goes five minutes without giving viewers a scene or sequence that looks like it cost more than a year's worth of earnings for Littlefinger's brothel. The cast is enormous, and though the frequent deaths keep things fresh and potentially low-cost for minor character contracts, the story has only gotten more epic and monumental in scale. So while there will be less episodes in Season 7 and Season 8, expect both to cost as much as previous 10-episode seasons did.\nRemember the season of Friends where the characters found the power rings and combined to become a giant mecha-robot that fought robots in space and stuff? Nope, that never happened, and Friends' very public budgetary issues came not because of pricey settings and scenarios, but the power of its central cast during the contract negotiation process. Had the central six actors all retained their initial per-episode rates, perhaps the costs wouldn't have rocketed higher than New York City apartment buildings, but once they each started pulling in $1 million an episode, it made the \"Must See\" in \"Must See TV\" all the more important for NBC.\nOne of the longest running modern dramas on TV, ER was another source of financial woes for NBC during its \"Must See TV\" era, although the medical hit started off extremely cost-friendly.

You can\u2019t completely avoid turnover, of course, but hiring the right people\u2014and keeping them\u2014undoubtedly saves time. The right people will constantly be learning. Eventually, they\u2019ll be able to solve problems the way you would when you\u2019re not around. But how do you find them?\nIn my company\u2019s early days, we ran into a lot of trouble trying to hire the right people. Not that we were hiring the wrong people, but we couldn\u2019t seem to find the right ones. We posted on every popular online job board. Regardless of the position\u2014SEO Specialists, Social Media professionals, etc.\u2014we got very few applicants. We were lucky if ten people applied for one position.\nWe eventually found that the problem was with the posts themselves. Though they accurately reflected what the jobs would entail, they were too specific to show up in many online job searches with basic keywords. Prospective employees don\u2019t always look for specific job titles; rather, they search for keywords related to the job level, industry, or personality.\nOf course, it\u2019s not just acquiring applicants that ensures you hire the right people for your company. We have a specific and rigorous interview process that is the key determinant of who we take on. However, so much of our success depends on our employees\u2019 interactions with one another. The more prospects we get to the interview stage, the higher our chances of finding the best fit.\nHow could we widen our pool of applicants? We needed Project Managers and Content Writers, but we knew we could train anyone with the right personality to be able to do these jobs well. So, what kind of personalities did we need?\nFor starters, we knew that applicants straight out of college and eager for work would be good people to fill these roles. However, very few of them would search for jobs with \u201cspecialist\u201d in the title. Rather than searching for a highly-focused dream job, recent graduates are much more concerned with finding a job in the first place. There were plenty of potential employees out there with the eagerness and discipline we\u2019d been searching for. Plus, their college degrees and other experiences ensured they would be highly trainable. But with our highly specific job posts, we weren\u2019t attracting them to the company.\nSo, we began making more of our posts friendly to entry-level job searchers. We molded the posts to the kind of candidates we wanted rather than to the specific job title. For instance, instead of titling a job post \u201cSEO Specialist,\u201d we named it \u201cAdmin/Content Writer.\u201d For project managers, we used terms like \u201cPR Coordinator.\u201d By using general entry-level terms like \u201cadmin,\u201d \u201cassistant\u201d and \u201ccoordinator,\u201d we immediately saw an increase in the number of qualified applicants; instead of getting maybe 10 resumes in total, we were now receiving closer to 200.\nI can\u2019t over-emphasize how having the right team members\u2014the ones who \u2018get\u2019 your company and its other employees\u2014is vital to your company\u2019s success. It\u2019s much easier to get these people onboard and shift responsibilities as it becomes necessary rather than undergoing constant turnover."}

In the film, Seth Rogen and James Franco star as a producer and TV journalist who are asked to kill Kim Jong-Un (Randall Park), after they secured an interview with the North Korean dictator. While it remains to be seen if and/or when the full film will be released, the death scene has been leaked online, which some believe may have been the reason for the massive Sony hack in the first place.\nGawker originally released the clip on Monday, which the site later removed, but the scene has surfaced again, showcasing the fiery death of the North Korean leader, set to the Katy Perry hit song \"Firework.\" A New York Times article reveals that this scene in particular caused Sony's chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, to break a 25-year tradition by intervening in a Sony Pictures decision, which has long been autonomous from its parent company. The executive insisted that the death scene be toned down, removing images of Kim Jong-Un's flaming hair and chunks of his skull after the explosion.\nSeth Rogen, who co-directs with Evan Goldberg and stars in The Interview, and Sony Pictures' Amy Pascal sent Hirai three different versions of the death scene, one which was vetoed by Hirai, another which was vetoed by the directors and a third, dubbed \"shot #337,\" in which, \"there is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.\" On September 29, Hirai approved this version, but asked Amy Pascal to tone down the violence even further, with a caveat that this scene cannot make it into the film's international version.\nAmy Pascal did press for Seth Rogen to tone down the scene even more, which he did, stating in an October 6 email that they removed, \"fire from the hair\" and \"the entire secondary wave of head chunks.\" The filmmaker/star added, expressing his apparent exasperation with the process, \"Please tell us this is over now.\" While it isn't known if or when fans will ever get to see this scene on the big screen, you can take a look at the leaked clip below, showcasing the death of Randall Park's Kim Jong-Un.

The effects of climate change add 100 million people to that toll. Rob McDonald, lead author of the study, said these numbers reflect current trends and are by no means definitive.\n\"Fast urban growth and climate change pose a challenge,\" said McDonald, a scientist with the Nature Conservancy. \"It's a challenge that can be met and has to be met.\"\nThe 100-liter-per-day benchmark comes from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Both recommend it as the minimum amount for consumption in normal uses like bathing, drinking and cooking. In contrast, the average American uses 376 liters a day, although that number varies per region.\nFor the study, McDonald and six other scientists used a projected global population of 9 billion by 2050. That paints a picture of a world where one of every nine people lacks a reliable water supply. Currently, about 150 million people worldwide get by on less than 100 liters of water every day. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the present world population at 6.9 billion.\nBetween now and 2050, the study projects the world will add 3 billion people in cities, most of them in developing areas in India, West Africa and China. That's roughly the equivalent of adding a city the size of Washington, D.C., to the world every week, McDonald said.\nMuch of this urban growth will occur in areas with seasonal water shortages. The study projects 3.1 billion people will be dealing with seasonal water shortages by 2050.\nShifting water away from agriculture?\nMcDonald identifies three elements essential to urban areas providing water to people. First, there has to be enough water nearby for a city to tap into. Second, an infrastructure needs to be developed that can bring that water to its people. Finally, that water has to be clean enough to drink. His study focuses on the first element, water availability.\nWhile a shifting climate will change different environments in different ways, it will ultimately leave more people without water than before, according to the study.\n\"Some cities are going to get wetter, and some will get drier,\" McDonald said, \"but [climate change] puts 100 million more in water-stressed areas.\"\nSince most of the projected urban growth will happen in seasonally water-stressed areas, there's a wider range of solutions for the problem than there would be in dry areas like deserts, McDonald said.\nAgriculture, the world's biggest water consumer, is also one of its the biggest wasters. The report recommends improving the industry's efficiency and cites previously successful approaches. One, in South Africa, had farmers remove plantations of non-native trees that require a lot of water to survive.\nThe report is a part of a series of studies from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis examining the effects of urban growth. Its funding came from the National Science Foundation and the Nature Conservancy.\nCould Carbon Labeling Combat Climate Change?"}

Ramos is now charged with killing five people at a Maryland newspaper last week.\nUSA TODAY reviewed thousands of pages of court records and interviewed dozens of people who knew or interacted with Ramos to build this profile. It shows an angry man who became obsessed with the people he felt wronged him, from a former high school classmate and her lawyer to the judges he appeared before and the journalists who exposed his campaign of harassment.\nExperts say the attack at the Capital Gazette highlights the challenges of trying to balance the rights of people to speak freely against concerns that they could turn violent. In a court filing, Ramos said he had seen five mental health professionals for at least 75 visits before last week's shooting.\nDespite his pattern of threats, Ramos never offered any hint he would actually act on them. He had been engaged in a lengthy fight with the Capital Gazette over its coverage of a court case in 2011 which he pleaded guilty to harassing a former classmate. In one court filing, Ramos said he wanted to kill journalist Eric Hartley but phrased it in a very specific way: \"If not illegal, (I) would kill the living body of Hartley.\"\nStill, his behavior was enough to strike fear in attorney Brennan McCarthy, who represented the high school classmate Ramos pleaded guilty to harassing.\nMcCarthy chillingly warned in a court filing: \"There exists a very real possibility that at some point in time, Mr. Ramos will take these violent fetishes as expressed in print, and will try to carry them out in person.\"\nRamos' extensive court filings provide a window into his hyperbolic contemptuous attitude toward the legal system. After a judge sentenced him to counseling and probation for stalking his former classmate online, Ramos tried to have the woman prosecuted for perjury, suggested the judge should be disbarred and then unsuccessfully sued the journalist and newspaper. He criticized one court clerk for being sloppy because her mother was ill and suggested another made mistakes because she was thirsty.\nRamos titled sections of his court filings \"Murder of the spirit\" and \"blood on their hands,\" and he acknowledged he told his former classmate to \"have another drink and go hang yourself, you cowardly little lush.\u201d He emailed her boss to say she was a \u201cbipolar drunkard leading a double life.\u201d He then insisted he was \"not a wantonly abusive person\" and hadn't hurt anyone since he was a child.

It's a welcome sight after years of intense focus on marble, and a more budget-friendly alternative, too. Despite its glamorous associations with old-world architecture, terrazzo (often called \"poor man's marble\") was invented in 15th-century Venice as a low-cost flooring option, created by mixing scraps of marble with clay, and sealing the mixture with goat's milk to bring out the stone's vibrancy. The recipe eventually evolved to include cement and resin, and now often adds granite, porcelain and glass to the mixture for a kaleidoscopic look.\nTerrazzo has been popping up in the hippest of spots: as flooring at the Wes Anderson-designed Bar Luce in Milan, for example, and as multiple surfaces at Maison Kitsun\u00e9's new Paris flagship, for which designer Max Lamb created a splattered paint print that's been spun off into a capsule collection of clothing.\nIt's also spreading to furniture. After a visit to a small Italian terrazzo factory, Danish designer Simon Legald fell in love with its look. That newfound admiration manifested itself in the Terra series produced by Normann Copenhagen. The slender terrazzo tabletops \u2013 available in grey, beige, as well as more colourful blue and green \u2013 are supported by matching twisted steel legs, adding a contemporary spin to the classic shape. Inspired by Stockholm subway platforms, Swedish designer Daniel Enoksson swapped ubiquitous concrete bases for terrazzo ones in simple grey and anthracite steel bistro tables for the Danish brand Hay. And the Primo Terrazzo Tavolini collection from U.K.-based Another Brand utilizes the sculptural nature of the material for stoic column-like tables in three different heights and diameters.\nTerra Tables by Normann Copenhagen, starting at $630 at The Modern Shop (www.themodernshop.com).\nIndependent designers have also succumbed to terrazzo's charms. Los Angeles-based Carly Jo Morgan crafts sculptural black-and-white planters and chairs in the material, as well as elegant lights with brass hardware sitting on pink terrazzo bases. Fellow Angelenos Erin and Ian Besler, the husband-and-wife team behind architecture studio Besler & Sons, also explore the playful nature of the material with their Props collection of decorative objects that can be used as bookends, doorstops, paperweights and serving platters.\nThe trend extends well beyond solid pieces into faux fabrics and wall treatments. Danish company Ferm Living added a rainbow of terrazzo-like textiles to its cushion collection, as well as rose and blue kids' beanbags and two terrazzo wallpapers. Paris-based Eno Studio's Terrazzo collection includes dark blue, pink and white wall options, while London-based Murals Wallpaper has multiple scale choices, from tiny coloured slivers to blown-up close-ups of graphic shards.

The weekend of the referendum saw a demonstration to the streets of Belfast with women demanding freedom to control their bodies.\nA range of Tory and Labour MPs including Penny Mordaunt, the women and equalities minister and four of her predecessors have called for the London parliament to pass legislation allowing women in the north of Ireland the right to free, legal abortion close to home.\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader in the north, Michelle O\u2019Neill told a local radio programme \u201cshe does not want to import Britain\u2019s abortion law to Northern Ireland as \u201cit goes far further than what we would be proposing\u201d. Meanwhile the SDLP voted to allow a free vote on the question of abortion, while continuing to describe itself as \u2018pro-life\u2019.\nFrom the point of view of women in the north of Ireland it doesn\u2019t really matter what constitutional mechanism gives them control over their own bodies. But two things are clear. The DUP is a very ideological party and its MPs will vote against any moves in the Westminster parliament to give women in the north the right to abortion and this is a clash May will want to avoid.\nHowever, women in every part of Ireland are saying loud and clear that they don\u2019t want priests or MPs telling them what to do with their own bodies and they have the power to change the situation. Socialists and feminists need to be offering solidarity to women in the north of Ireland in their struggle to decriminalise abortion and, at the moment, one of the ways of doing that is by putting pressure on British MPs to take stand in support of a change in the law."}

The sector exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) is up double digits since January\u2019s opening session. That said, the market movement has been anything but steady, with several key players suffering disappointing performances.\nBut in the bigger picture, investors have an opportunity to use this weakness in biotech stocks to their advantage. In my opinion, biotech firms represent ideal contrarian opportunities due to their often binary nature. When a company hits or exceeds performance benchmarks, shares launch into low-earth orbit. However, failure often results in excessive selloffs that can endure for lengthy periods.\nUnderstanding this dynamic, sector weakness is an ideal time to consider well-capitalized and fundamentally sound biotech stocks. Investors punish health-related companies with unusual vigor, even though their underlying financial situation may not have changed.\nBut don\u2019t forget some of the smaller names in this investment category. Many of them offer underappreciated therapies that could take off once the right conditions are met.\nIf I could describe AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in two words, I would use the terms revenue and earnings. In the trailing three-year period, ABBV generated 12.4% top-line growth, which is better than 72% of the competition. Furthermore, the company has nearly 43% EBITDA growth, which places it in the top ten among biotech stocks.\nMuch of this financial success comes from AbbVie\u2019s standout drug, Humira. Doctors prescribe Humira to address pain and inflammation problems resultant from a variety of autoimmune diseases. These include rheumatoid arthritis, chronic plaque psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease.\nBeyond helping countless patients ease their suffering, Humira brings a ton of green to the table. Between 2011 through 2017, Humira revenues jumped from $7.9 billion to $18.4 billion. Annually, this translates to an impressive 15% growth rate.\nThe markets, though, haven\u2019t been too hot on ABBV stock. Year-to-date, shares have only gained 4.6%. It\u2019s also down double digits since mid-March, providing opportunists with a blue-chip bargain.\nSeveral top biotech stocks haven\u2019t lived up to expectations this year, and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is one of them. Against January\u2019s opener, GILD stock has only gained 2.5%, which is incredibly pedestrian. Even worse, it was having a decent go, putting in a double-digit performance until just recently.\nSo why the fallout? GILD was on the receiving end of two negative factors. First, while the company reported a solid second-quarter earnings report, investors noted that its hepatitis C drug revenues slipped 66% year-over-year.\nNext, it incurred internal drama when the biotech giant announced that CEO John Milligan will step down at year\u2019s end. Taken as a whole, the markets didn\u2019t appreciate the news, and decided to sell off GILD stock.\nAlthough the bearishness is understandable, new investors should keep a close eye on GILD. The company still levers impressive financials, particularly with their excellent profitability margins. Also, it has a favorable cash-to-debt ratio relative to its peers.\nEven compared to"}

Drake Hamilton, science policy director for St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, a renewable energy advocacy group.\nThe federal social cost of carbon, devised in 2010 by several government agencies, is the most complete measure of the costs of carbon dioxide emissions, Fresh Energy and environmental groups argue.\nUtilities agree the cost needs to be updated but have proposed their own formulas.\nThe federal social cost of carbon ranges from $11 to $57 per ton of carbon, and has often been applied at $37 per ton. That\u2019s considerably higher than the state\u2019s current cost of 44 cents to $4.53 per ton.\nXcel Energy plans to phase out its coal-fired Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating Station plants with a natural-gas-fired facility in Becker, Minn.\nConsumers won\u2019t see a carbon fee on their bills, but it could be important to utilities deciding on new power plants.\nThe Minnesota Department of Commerce and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency both back using the federal social cost of carbon. An administrative law judge last year also backed the federal cost, allowing for two exceptions, and such rulings usually play a significant role in cases before public utilities regulators.\nBut the state\u2019s utilities and their large industrial customers aren\u2019t keen on using the federal social cost of carbon, and instead are offering their own means to update carbon costs. Their formulas generally come up with prices higher than today\u2019s state standard, but below the federal cost. Xcel Energy\u2019s proposed cost is closest to the federal cost.\nXcel has argued in state regulatory filings that updated social carbon costs \u201cwill directly affect what kind of resources Minnesota utilities will rely on and build in the future.\u201d The Minneapolis-based utility, the state\u2019s largest, declined to make an executive available for an interview.\nTo add a twist to the state proceedings, President Donald Trump earlier this year discarded the federal social cost of carbon, which has been instrumental in setting environmental and energy regulations.\nTrump\u2019s order on energy in March, among other factors, eliminated the 12-agency group that devised a carbon cost to be applied uniformly on a federal level. Instead, each agency will make its own carbon cost determination, based on a less-stringent regulatory proclamation from 2003.\nProponents of using the federal cost in Minnesota say Trump\u2019s action isn\u2019t relevant for state proceedings. But utilities and large utility customers have asked the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to take Trump\u2019s decision into consideration.\nThe PUC is slated to listen to arguments at meetings starting Friday and make a decision next Thursday. Also at those meetings, the PUC will consider a petition from environmental groups on pricing particulate matter emitted from fossil-fuel plants, as well as the pollutants sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.\nThe PUC is grappling with what is known in economics as negative externalities: Costs that are not paid for by a producer, but instead are borne by a nonrelated third party, usually the public.\nThe social cost of carbon is used in resource planning by utilities.

A third of them were given heroin to inject, another third took the heroin substitute methadone orally, and the final third injected methadone -- all of this under medical supervision.\nThose given the actual heroin responded best. Three-quarters of that group said they \"substantially\" reduced their level of street drug use. And since much of the money to pay for street drugs comes from committing crimes, that means crime has been reduced.\nIn the United Kingdom, it is estimated that between half and two-thirds of all crime is drug related. Here in the United States, around 18% of convicted committed their crimes in order to obtain money for drugs, according to Justice Department&apos;s Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition, in 2007 4% of all murders were drug related, and 26% of victims of crime said their assailant was on drugs or drunk at the time the crime was committed against them.\nIn the British study, the group who injected heroin admitted to committing a combined 1731 crimes in the month before the program started.

In this series we've asked a number of our authors to suggest a book, philosopher, work of art - or anything else, for that matter - that will help to make sense of it all.\nThe world we live in is a dangerous and confusing place. In my quest to make sense of it, I'm returning to Marxism and Freedom - 40 years after reading it for the first time.\nIt was written by the founder of the philosophy of Marxist-Humanism, Raya Dunayevskaya (1910-1987). I read the book for the first time in 1979: the year Margaret Thatcher was elected in Britain, and the formal beginning of the neoliberal counter-revolution. Dunayevskaya called it a \"changed world\". At that point the book was already over 20 years old, but I found something refreshing about its engagement with Marxism as a living philosophy connected with daily life struggles.\nMy return to Marxism and Freedom here in 2019 has focused on some of its ideas that might help orient our thinking in the present. This, at a time when we're facing the morbid stages of neoliberalism in its neo-fascist and authoritarian-nationalist forms: from Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump in the US, from Turkey's Recep Erdo\u011fan to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nDunayevskaya (who was born Raya Shpigel but took her mother's maiden name) was not an academic but a revolutionary intellectual schooled by organisations and their struggles. She joined the revolutionary movement in the United States as a teenager in the early 1920s, and was kicked out of the Communist Party at age 18 after asking for a discussion about Leon Trotsky. He was a leading Marxist revolutionary who was expelled from the USSR in 1929 after criticising Joseph Stalin.\nDunayevskaya joined the Trotskyist movement. She is probably best known as Trotsky's Russian language secretary in Mexico, which is where he settled after his expulsion and where he was assassinated in 1940. By the time he died, Dunayevskaya had broken with Trotsky over his defence of the Soviet Union after the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939.\nShe argued that Russia was a state-capitalist rather than a socialist society, and held that Marx's theory of liberation had been transformed into its opposite by the Communist Party intelligentsia to justify a ruthless totalitarian system.\nreestablish Marxism in its original form, which Marx called 'a thoroughgoing Naturalism, or Humanism'.\nPrefiguring what is now called intersectionality, she highlighted \"new passions and new forces\" that emerged in freedom struggles. She argued that activists and intellectuals must keep their ears open to these new voices and new articulations of freedom that had often been silenced or ignored.\nDunayevskaya considered black liberation movements the vanguard of historical freedom struggles in the United States.\nShe also declared the African and Asian decolonisation movements that developed after the end of World War II epochal, as they raised the question of human relations as a \"totality of devotion to the struggle for freedom\".\nThe brilliance of Marxism and Freedom, and its re-articulation of Marx's Marxism as a theory of liberation, is that it was written in collaboration with miners, autowork"}

This, then, involves a simultaneous decision process where key issues, such as the water example mentioned earlier, are considered from all sides at the same time (that is, simultaneously) before the team commits to a preferred process. In this manner, each of the various team members can provide input for the design, engineering, cost and schedule, especially as it pertains to the overall sustainability of the proposed project.\nThis process often requires that some design tasks need to be prepared early on. Energy modeling, for example, is often performed in the design development stage of a sequential design process. This may be too late for the simultaneous process. With the simultaneous process, this step must occur much earlier to inform the other team members about the overall design requirements, and their effects on cost, overall sustainability and project scheduling.\nA number of inherently sustainable design considerations also need to be broached early on in the simultaneous design process so that all design team members can provide their input as to the possible interactions with the other building concepts. These sustainable considerations include things such as site selection and final orientation, glazing/fenestra-tion, external solar controls, possible double-wall facades, overall renewable energy options, external natural landscaping considerations, reusable construction materials, building/ lab water use/recycling, material and people flow throughout the building, and, of course, the cost implications of all of these considerations and options. As a matter of fact, the sustainable options being considered may often be the primary design drivers for many of the discussion points in the very early stages of an integrated simultaneous design process.\nIn our reader survey, one of the queries was targeted on learning about the current status of the respondent\u2019s organization\u2019s completion of their company\u2019s sustainability goals, which is summarized in Chart 4. The most selected option was their organization\u2019s goal to increase overall safety within the research lab (59% completion toward meeting their sustainability goal). This choice, while marginally focused on the overall sustainability of the lab, is always the most selected option in any of numerous surveys that the editors of R&D Magazine/Laboratory Design perform. Without having the safest laboratory environment possible, all other considerations are moot.\nThe second most selected goal in this section was the goal to reduce waste, where the survey respondents indicated that their organizations were 46% of the way to meeting their goal for reducing waste. This is not surprising due to the overall increasing focus on recycling, materials reuse and the research lab\u2019s use of specific sustainable materials and selection processes. Glassware washers are more in vogue now compared with the use of disposable plastic ware systems.\nMaterials are now selected that generate smaller levels of waste.\ndesign considerations agreed upon or compromised upon.\nThe third most selected survey choices as to where the survey respondents\u2019 organizations are with regard to completing their sustainability goals was in the area of staff retention and staff productivity.

The second unit is estimated to face a nine-month delay.\nExperts said the UK faced significant challenges to electricity supply and the prospect of further delay at Hinkley meant ageing power stations may need to be kept open longer.\nIn a review of costs for Hinkley, EDF said \u00a31.5bn of the increase was due to a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d of the construction work needed and UK regulatory requirements. The estimated delay on completing the reactors \u2013 which are meant to set a new standard for nuclear safety \u2013 would add a further \u00a30.7bn in cost.\nBut the company insisted it was still aiming for a delivery date of the end of 2025, and said it was on track to pour the concrete for the first reactor in 2019.\nThe two other major nuclear power stations using the same design, in France and Finland, are years behind schedule and significantly over budget.\nDe Rivaz told the House of Lords last year that the company had \u201cdramatically\u201d changed its approach for Hinkley, compared with Flamanville 3 in north-west France, which was originally due to be finished in 2012 but was not expected to be complete until late 2018.\nIn 2007, De Rivaz predicted that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using atomic power from new reactors at Hinkley.\nThe latest bad news about the plant came just over a week after the public spending watchdog condemned the government for locking consumers into an \u201cexpensive and risky\u201d project by signing a subsidy deal guaranteeing a set price for power from the reactors.\nThe Green party said EDF\u2019s review of costs should be the \u201cfinal nail in the coffin\u201d for Hinkley, a third of which is financed by the Chinese General Nuclear Power Group.\n\u201cHardly a week passes at the moment without new evidence that Hinkley is a terrible deal,\u201d said the party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley.\nEDF said if the \u00a32.2bn cost increase came to pass, its rate of return on the project would drop from 9% to 8.2%. The company\u2019s share price fell 0.3% to \u20ac9.45 on Monday after the announcement. Some analysts have factored in a delay to the plant.\nDr Paul Dorfan, a vocal Hinkley critic at University College London\u2019s Energy Institute, said the admission showed that lessons had not been learned from the same reactor design being built at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland.\n\u201cOn top of the National Audit Office [report], on top of the fiasco of Flamanville and Olkiluoto, on top of the [UK subsidy] deal itself, which has been universally slated by every financial expert, now we see another \u00a32bn on the top,\u201d he said.\nDorfman said the estimated delay also called into question new-build nuclear\u2019s ability to keep the lights"}

It carries a US$925,000 salary-cap hit and includes a minor-league component at US$70,000.\nThe 21-year-old Gaudette not only led NCAA scoring with 60 points (30-30) in 38 games, the 2015 fifth-round draft pick is a favourite to capture the Hobey Baker Award as the top collegiate player. Amid all that, the Braintree, Mass., native \u2014 he arrived in Vancouver on Monday night and could play Thursday to burn the first year of his deal \u2014 captured the imagination of his teammates and the Canucks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good team guy \u2014 every night you know what you\u2019re getting from him,\u201d said Sikura. \u201cIt\u2019s his passion for the game.

And while it might be easier for the right-shot Gaudette to transition to the NHL as a replacement for injured winger Brock Boeser, that\u2019s not the plan. Much like Bo Horvat, the 6-foot-1, 184-pound Gaudette is a centre by trade and the Canucks will get a quick read on where his complete game is at.\nAnd a nose for the net.\nAside from total-game awareness and an improving stride, Gaudette scored 56 goals in 75 games the past two NCAA seasons. That gets your attention. This season, he formed one of the most formidable trios with Sikura, who had 22 goals, and captain Nolan Stevens, who struck 24 times and signed an entry-level deal with the St. Louis Blues on Sunday.\nGaudette was also first in points per game (1.58), second in game-winning goals (five) and third in power-play goals (11).\nIt made Gaudette\u2019s contract leverage \u2014 burning a year of his deal like Boeser did a year ago \u2014 easier for Benning to digest. Gaudette could have gone back to Northeastern for a fourth year and become an unrestricted free agent if he didn\u2019t reach terms here by August 2019.\nThat wasn\u2019t going to happen. Gaudette is loyal to the Canucks for taking the draft chance and they needed to lock up a top prospect.\nA window on Gaudette\u2019s world opened July 6 in the Summer Showcase at Rogers Arena. Pitted against coveted first-round draft pick Elias Pettersson before 5,000 season-ticket holders, Gaudette was hard on the forecheck, hard on Pettersson with a heavy shoulder check behind the net and hard on goalies with a two-goal effort.\nGaudette\u2019s ascension mirrors many prominent U.S.-born prospects.

The water will usually drain out of the ear naturally, but if it does not, a type of infection called swimmer's ear may develop.\nA person who has water trapped in their ear may experience a tickling sensation that extends from the ear to the jaw or throat. They may also have problems with hearing and sounds may be muffled.\nPeople should avoid inserting anything into the ear canal, such as pens, fingers, bobby pins, or cotton-tipped swabs. Doing so can damage the delicate lining of the ear canal and increase the risk of an ear infection. There are a number of safe ways to get water out of your ears.\nWearing earplugs when swimming may help to prevent water becoming trapped in the ear.\nHere are a number of ways in which people can safely remove water that is trapped in their ears.\nTugging or jiggling the earlobe while tilting the head down toward the shoulder. A person could also try shaking their head from side to side.\nCreating a vacuum by tilting the head sideways and keeping a palm tightly cupped over the ear might help. By rapidly flattening and cupping the hand against the ear, a vacuum will be created that might pull the water out.\nApplying a warm compress to the ear. The person should leave the compress in place for about 30 seconds, remove it for a minute, and then repeat four or five times. Lying down on the affected side of the body may also help the water to drain.\nEvaporating the trapped water in the ear using a blow dryer. A person should set the blow dryer to its lowest setting and hold it about 1 foot away from the ear. By tugging the earlobe down while moving the dryer in a back-and-forth motion, the heat from the dryer may evaporate the trapped water.\nCombining half alcohol and half vinegar in ear drops may be effective if these other remedies do not work. The alcohol helps evaporate the water, while the vinegar may help prevent bacteria from growing. Using a sterile dropper, a person should put 3 or 4 drops of the solution into their ear. After 30 seconds, they should tilt their head sideways to allow the solution to drain out.\nDiluting hydrogen peroxide ear drops with water. Again, a person should use 3-4 drops of the solution. After 2-3 minutes, they should tilt the affected side of the head, which will allow the fluid to drain out.\nA person can make a warm compress by soaking a washcloth in warm water, wringing it out so that it does not drip, and holding it against the affected ear while tilting the head downward.\nNo one should use either of the methods that involve ear drops if they already have an ear infection, a punctured eardrum, or ear tubes.\nA good way to prevent water from becoming trapped in the ear is to wear a cap or ear plugs when bathing or swimming, or using a dry towel to clean the ears after coming out of the water.\nDoctors recommend that people who play water sports or who are frequently in water should wear ear plugs. Shaking the head from side to side after getting out of the water also helps to drain water from the ears.\nThere is a selection of ear plugs available for purchase online.\nIf water is trapped in the ear for too long, a person may develop an infection.

To most, taking care of their body means taking a daily multi-vitamin, working out regularly, eating a balanced diet and attempting to get the recommended eight hours of sleep nightly. Mental well being, however, is often left out of the discussion of general wellness.\nCornell students like us are driven to succeed in the classroom and determined to find success after graduation. But whether you are a freshman trying to find your group of friends, or a senior looking for a job, we are all subject to stress during our college careers. At a rigorous academic institution like Cornell, there is sadly a stigma of weakness associated with asking for help. It is clear from the suicides of past semesters that mental wellbeing was perhaps not at the forefront on campus, but that is definitely changing. Now the important thing is to make sure that students take advantage of the help available to them.\nTaking care of yourself mentally should be viewed as another component in wellness, just like diet and exercise. According to Alison Malmon, founder of Active Minds, \u201cWe all may not have mental illness, but we all have mental health.\u201d Malmon lost her brother to suicide during her freshman year of college and founded Active Minds, a non-profit organization working to change the conversation about mental health.

For me, it is hiring a cleaning person. It is something that I don\u2019t do often, but that I savor every once in a great while. To me, the feeling of a deeply cleaned home is one of the best luxuries to enjoy.\nHowever, in doing this I have learned that professional cleaners have limits. For instance, many will not move furniture; take items off of counters, or clean windows. Doing so would put them at risk for injury. Luckily, I do not mind cleaning windows. It is one of those types of projects that have a clear reward at the end (pun intended).\nFirst, know what causes them. For us, it is the splashes from our sprinklers on the lawn. One solution would be to treat the water. Another would be to adjust the sprinkler pressure. If neither are options, consider adjusting the timing of the sprinklers. Ours go off just before dawn. That way, the morning dew or passing showers can help to ever so slightly rinse the water residue the sprinklers leave behind.\nIf there is not much you can do about hard water hitting your windows, try making this solution. Mix vinegar and water in equal parts. Soak a towel in the mixture. Place the towel on the window and let it sit for 10 minutes. If you cannot lay your window flat, you may need to hold the towel on the window. Wipe with a lint-free cloth. Rinse, and wipe with a clean cloth or use a squeegee if you have one. Repeat this process once or twice. If it does not work, try adding baking soda to the mixture. Repeat the same steps listed above.\nIf neither of these mixtures work, try this one. Use two parts vinegar, one part liquid dish soap and one part lemon juice. Spray the mixture onto your window and allow it to sit for at least 10-15 minutes. The liquid dish soap will help the mixture to sit on the window, so you can skip the towel soaking. Scrub with a brush. Rinse with fresh water, and wipe with a lint-free cloth or squeegee.

The findings of the study are published in the journal ERJ Open Research.\nNew research on the types of bacteria living in babies' noses could offer clues as to why some recover quickly from their first cough or cold, while others suffer for longer.\nThe study suggests that babies who have a wide variety of different bacteria living in their noses tend to recover more quickly from their first respiratory virus, compared to those who have less variety and more bacteria from either the Moraxellaceae or Streptococcaceae family.\nThe researchers say their findings do not offer an immediate solution to help babies recover more quickly from coughs and colds. However, the results could help scientists understand the importance of the bacteria living in the respiratory tract, and how they influence infections and long-term conditions such as asthma.\nDr. Roland P Neumann from University Children's Hospital of Basel, University of Basel, Switzerland, was one of the researchers. He explained: \"It's well known that different types of bacteria live in our gut. The respiratory tract is also home to a wide variety of bacteria, and we are beginning to understand that the types and numbers of these bacteria, what we refer to as the microbiota, can influence our respiratory health.\n\"We know that babies often suffer from coughs, runny noses, sore throats, and ear infections, and in some babies, the symptoms seem to drag on for weeks. These are usually caused by a virus such as the common cold, but we wanted to investigate whether the microbiota of the nose might also have a role in how long symptoms last. This is important not only in terms of babies feeling unwell but also because respiratory infections in the early years are linked to the development of asthma in later life.\"\nThe research was part of a larger study that is following a group of babies from birth to investigate the complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors and their influence on lung health.\nParents taking part in this part of the study were asked to contact the researchers as soon as their babies developed symptoms of their first respiratory infection. This included more than two consecutive days when their babies were coughing, had a runny nose, signs of an ear infection or a sore throat.\nResearchers took swabs from the noses of babies at that point and then took swabs again three weeks later. They analyzed the swabs by testing for the presence of respiratory viruses, such as the common cold, and for the types of numbers of different bacteria.\nWorking with sets of swabs from 183 babies, researchers were able to group the babies according to the makeup of their nasal microbiota.\nOn average, the babies' symptoms lasted around two weeks. Babies who were free of symptoms by the time the three-week swab was taken were more likely to have a wider mixture of bacteria in their noses and a microbiota that was not dominated by bacteria from the Moraxellaceae or Streptococcaceae family.\nAmong babies whose symptoms lasted three weeks or longer, researchers found less variety in the types of bacteria living in the babies' noses and the microbiota were more likely to be dominated by bacteria from the Moraxellaceae or Streptococcaceae family. These families include specific types that are known to be linked with respiratory disease.\nThey found no clear link between the type of respiratory virus and the persistence of symptoms.\nResearchers took account of other factors that are known to have an impact on respiratory health, including the babies age, the season of the year, whether"}

In 2015, TB was estimated to have killed 1.8 million people. Six countries account for 60% of the total number of cases of TB worldwide - India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa1.\nApproximately 1 in 5 cases of TB are now resistant to at least one major anti-TB drug and approximately 5% of all cases of TB are classed as MDR (resistant to two essential first-line TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin) or XDR (also resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs). Globally in 2015, there were an estimated 480000 cases of MDR-TB, with approximately half of these cases being in India, China, and Russia. But, migration and travel mean that highly drug-resistant TB strains have emerged in almost every part of the world.\nMDR and XDR-TB are associated with high mortality, are a threat to health-care workers, prohibitively expensive to treat, and are therefore a serious public health problem. The mortality rate is extremely high at around 40% for patients with MDR-TB, and 60% for patients with XDR-TB. Of the US$6.3 billion available in 2014 to respond to the global TB epidemic, about a third ($1.8 billion) was for MDR-TB (despite drug resistant TB forming only 5% of the total caseload).\nTB is caused by a bacterial species called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is treated with a combination of antibiotics. The treatment of TB was revolutionised in the 1950s with the introduction of three antibiotics: streptomycin, isoniazid, and para-aminosalicylic acid. The extensive overuse and abuse of antibiotics worldwide has led to a rise in bacteria that are drug resistant. Drug-resistant genetic mutations in the bacteria can occur as a result of inadequate treatment or can be passed on from one bacteria to another. Bacteria can acquire multiple drug resistance traits over time, making them resistant to several different types of antibiotics.\nUntil recently, it was thought that drug-resistant strains of TB were less transmissible, and that MDR- and XDR-TB was mainly acquired by individuals as a result of poor compliance to treatment. However, recent molecular and epidemiological studies, outlined in the Commission, have challenged this belief. In most regions of the world, drug-resistant TB is now predominantly caused by transmission, with an estimated 95.9% of new cases infected with MDR-TB strains due to the drug res"}

{"idx": "36985", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Denis Villeneuve crime-thriller Sicario might have been absent from some filmgoers' radars until its release, but it went on to become one of the most critically-acclaimed films of 2015. Made on a budget of roughly $30 million, the story centers on Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an idealistic FBI agent recruited to work on an anti-cartel task force alongside her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), under the command of the mysterious Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). Given the task of bringing down the leader of a powerful and brutal Mexican drug cartel, Macer and her team are quickly thrown into the middle of a dangerous war on drugs in the city of Ju\u00e1rez.\nAmong other accolades, the film received three Academy Award nominations (Best Cinematography, Best Original Score and Best Sound Editing), further highlighting some of Sicario\u2019s strengths. Consequently, Lionsgate commissioned a sequel \u2013 titled Soldado (the Spanish word for soldier) \u2013 centering on Matt\u2019s enigmatic partner, Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro). And while many had hoped that Villenueve would return to direct the sequel, it now appears that his busy schedule (namely, directing Blade Runner 2) has taken him away from the project.\nFollowing on from Villeneuve's departure, Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room) became the frontrunner to land the Soldado gig, but he too couldn\u2019t make the dates work in accordance with the film\u2019s fall production schedule. Now the latest reports (via THR) suggest that Stefano Sollima is currently in talks to take the director\u2019s chair for the follow-up, based on a script by Taylor Sheridan (who also penned Sicario).\nSollima has directed a number of memorably gritty crime thrillers, but is best known for his work on the Italian miniseries Gomorrah, along with his big screen debut, A.C.A.B., and the neo-noir film adaptation of Suburra, financed by Netflix. In addition to this slight shake-up behind the camera, Emily Blunt\u2019s recent decision to take on the role of Mary Poppins in Disney\u2019s forthcoming sequel Mary Poppins Returns has officially rendered her unavailable, consigning Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin to shared lead duties.\nThese developments might unnerve fans of the first installment, especially in regards to the directorial change. In particular, Villeneuve received commendation for his unique style, through which he incorporated his own distinct flare while capturing iconographic imagery - in collaboration with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins. Moreover, Blunt was praised for her performance alongside Del Toro, as the pair dovetailed each other wonderfully throughout.\nHowever, Sollima has plenty of experience with the crime-thriller genre, proving his ability to handle fast-paced dramatic storylines with emotive content, which can certainly make for a powerful cinematic experience. Furthermore, Soldado\u2019s storyline is focusing on a different character - the dark and mysterious Alejandro - so it could also be argued that the sequel will suit a slightly different tone compared to its predecessor. Regardless of your position on the latest news, serious dramas like Sicario are rarely given the sequel treatment, so that is a promising sign in itself."}

The way they sold this film, through my eyes, was with the idea of \u201cLiam Neeson as a hunted down ex-hitman.\u201d However, there seemed to be more in this film than just what we saw in the poster and the previews. Both made it seem like the film was just another big Hollywood Liam Neeson flick with no captivating substance, but to be honest, this father, son and family themed action flick is somewhat decent.\nSupposed ageless action-star Neeson portrays Jimmy Conlon, an ex-mobster and hitman whose life gets turned around when his estranged son, Michael (Joel Kinnaman), gets innocently mixed up in a homicide situation. Setting aside their differences, Jimmy and Michael race against time to clear Michael\u2019s name and keep his involved family safe.\nAs for the story, I believe it was crafted as best as it could\u2019ve been. Not much original quality can come when one has Liam Neeson, a high-stakes action plot and a New York City setting. Regardless, underneath this fast paced story lies the theme of the love and redemption possible between a hated father and an estranged son of 15 years. I feel the love between them, but there is hardly any convincing depth within it.\nDespite the lack of plot-driven emotion, the cinematography was well crafted and gave depth to the scene\u2019s overall feeling, in both the many car and on-foot chases, and the slower scenes.\nOverall, even though this unoriginal action plot has been dealt with time and time again, \u201cRun All Night\u201d wasn\u2019t incredibly unbearable. I wouldn\u2019t watch it again, but I encourage this movie to be seen by those who can appreciate a basic action flick. I give this movie two and a half out of five stars."}

The question is where to make the deepest cuts.\nFacing a projected $2.6 million budget deficit in fiscal year 2012-13, a divided City Council this week directed staff to explore the effects of broad salary and benefits cuts for city employees and impose a steep reduction in funding for civic festivals.\nCity Council members and staff generally agreed that the budget shortfall could not be closed without cuts to the city\u2019s payroll.\nThe council voted 5-2, with Corky Booze and Nat Bates dissenting, to have staff continue discussions and calculations associated with a tiered pay-cut plan and to cap all festival funding at $5,000, which would save about $55,000 by cutting more than half the overall budget for civic festivals.\nThe tiered plan, proposed by Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, would cut by 2 percent the pay of department heads and other executive staff. The plan would cut 1.5 percent from the pay of nonexecutives who earn more than $100,000 annually, and would cut by 1 percent the pay of all employees who earn between $40,000 and $100,000. Employees who earn less than $40,000 annually \u2014 mostly part-time staff \u2014 would not face salary reductions under the plan.\nMcLaughlin said the plan could amount to more than $1 million in savings.\nCuts to employee pay would require negotiations with local unions. Human Resources Director Leslie Knight said the city must negotiate with six unions, and that at least two had already volunteered to concede sick leave buyback perks. But there was no indication Tuesday that pay cuts would be conceded.\nPay cuts for the city\u2019s 900-person workforce would be only part of a slimmed-down city government proposed in the 2012-13 budget, which could be debated and fine-tuned for weeks. City departments\u2019 proposed budgets are on average 10 percent smaller than they were a year ago, according to staff reports.\nThe largest single program reduction is in the city\u2019s street-paving fund, which is proposed to be slashed from $5.9 million to $3.6 million, despite ongoing concerns with the conditions of city streets.\nCouncil and staff also reviewed data associated with other costs, including city-issued cars used by city employees.\nReducing funding support to the city\u2019s popular ethnic festivals, like Juneteenth and Cinco de Mayo, was criticized by several residents Tuesday.\nBates said small, unpopular cuts moved the process nowhere.\nBudget discussions are set to continue at the next council meeting June 26. The city maintains a reserve fund of about $10 million."}

{"idx": "36994", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The stock market has continued to hit new all-time records, but some individual stocks have dramatically outpaced what the broader market benchmarks have produced. In particular, a select few stocks have managed to double investors' money over the past year, and many investors wonder whether these stocks have more room to run. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), and Global Blood Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GBT) took different paths to get to their strong performance, and each has different potential catalysts that could move its stock in the months and years to come.\nThe Chinese video gaming industry has been a pocket of strong growth for a long time, and NetEase has done a good job of capitalizing on the potential of this key market. In its most recent quarter, it managed to boost its sales by more than half, and net income was up by more than two-thirds, continuing a streak of impressive gains for the gaming giant. NetEase has adopted a smart approach toward the industry, working to sustain its profits from the online gaming segment even as it expands into mobile and also looks at email, e-commerce, and other revenue streams to supplement its success. The result has been a 101% move higher for the stock since March 2016.\nLooking ahead, NetEase sees the mobile industry as the key to its future. The company believes that with mobile becoming the most important advertising platform in China, it needs to ensure that it gets in front of as many potential customers as possible. For investors, the fact that NetEase shares its profit gains in the form of dramatically rising dividends has only been icing on the cake for the dramatic share-price increases that the stock has produced over the past year.\nThe steel industry has suffered from the slowdown in economic activity across the globe for years. Beginning when the fast-growing Chinese economy started to slow down, construction and infrastructure activity levels declined, and that hurt demand for steel at a key moment for the U.S. producer. Yet as you can see from the chart above, the November election results marked a turning point for U.S. Steel's stock, as investors looked forward to promises that President Trump made to reinvigorate American manufacturing and make long-needed improvements to infrastructure.\nMore recently, U.S. Steel has given back some of its gains as investors worry about whether the Trump administration will be able to follow through on all of its planned initiatives. Nevertheless, the stock is up 144% over the past year, and with U.S. and global economic conditions looking more favorable, U.S. Steel has the potential to keep serving the world with the construction materials it needs to keep moving forward.\nFinally, Global Blood Therapeutics has delivered extremely strong performance recently with its gains of 131%. Investors have been enthusiastic about the prospects for the company's GBT440 treatment for sickle cell disease, and in January, Global Blood enrolled its first patient in its phase 3 HOPE study of the treatment for sickle-cell sufferers. Even after taking advantage of the jump in its share price to raise cash through a secondary offering, Global Blood has maintained its upward momentum.\nNow, some investors think that Global Blood Therapeutics might be a takeover target. Rumors have surfaced that Novo Nordisk might be interested in acquiring Global Blood. It's too early to tell whether those rumors will pan out, or whether the two companies will agree to a deal even if one is in the works. Yet investors can count on Global Blood to be in high demand if GBT440 lives up to its full potential for both sickle cell disease and other health"}

He was perhaps the most vociferous abortion opponent among the nine justices.\nThe Texas law has been replicated across the South and elsewhere, part of a wave of state abortion restrictions in the past five years.\nStates mainly led by Republicans have tried to limit when in a pregnancy abortions may be performed, restricted abortion-inducing drugs that take the place of surgery and increased standards for clinics and the doctors who work in them.\nThe Supreme Court case involves that last category. A Texas law enacted in 2013 requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. It also prohibits clinics from providing abortions unless they meet the standards of outpatient or ambulatory surgical centers.\nThe high court has partially blocked those measures. If allowed to take full effect, all but 10 clinics in Texas would have to close. There would be no abortion providers in the state\u2019s rural areas or west of San Antonio. The only clinic in the Rio Grande Valley would be allowed to remain open on a limited basis. Before the law was passed, there were roughly 40 clinics in the state. About half have closed.\nThe case offers competing views of how to protect women\u2019s health. The clinics contend abortions are safer than many other medical procedures that are less stringently regulated and that the clinic regulations have only one purpose: to reduce the availability of abortions.\n\u201cThese laws are tantamount to an outright ban for too many,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates clinics in Texas and other states.\nDefenders of the laws in Texas and elsewhere argue that states have discretion to take steps to make abortions safer. Alabama and other states backing Texas told the Supreme Court that states were within their rights to apply health regulations to clinics for the sake of patients.\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m pro-life and I would like to limit the number of abortions, but here we were looking at women\u2019s health and safety,\u201d said Republican Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, a doctor who signed his state\u2019s admitting privileges law.\nTexas Solicitor General Scott Keller, who will defend the law at the Supreme Court, said Texas acted in response to the high-profile case of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell. He is serving a life sentence after his conviction for killing three babies born alive and for the overdose death of a woman who was a clinic patient.\nA federal judge in Texas struck down parts of the law as not intended to promote women\u2019s health and clearly aimed at reducing access to abortion. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans largely accepted the state\u2019s argument.\nThe justices\u2019 June 2015 order putting the appellate ruling on hold at least suggests that there is a majority to cut back on the regulations. The clinics and abortion-rights groups are hoping for a ruling that might bolster challenges to other restrictions on abortion.\nTo prevail, they still need Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s vote, along with the reasonably certain votes of four more liberal justices, just as they did before Scalia\u2019s death. Kennedy was part of the 5-4 majority to reaffirm abortion rights in 1992, then wrote the court\u2019"}

{"idx": "36999", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Is the gap between U.S. and German yields overstretched?\nTo the astonishment of bond investors, the premium for owning Treasurys over the safest government bonds in the eurozone hit its richest levels since the fall of the Berlin Wall last week.\nThe spread between the 2-year German bond yield TMBMKDE-02Y, +0.00% and the U.S. 2-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.68% has run up to more than 3 percentage points, its widest since 1989.\nThe vast gulf between the two bond markets has puzzled investors because yields for German bonds, or bunds, and Treasurys have historically traveled in lockstep as they offer two of the few haven assets left in financial markets. Analysts say the wider the yield gap, the more likely it was to snap back as Europe-based investors would sell German bonds to buy U.S. Treasurys, taking advantage of this rich premium until the spread narrowed.\nYet, analysts have highlighted two reasons why this spread is likely to remain for a protracted period.\nOne, the relative deterioration of economic data in Europe compared with U.S. data will keep their respective central banks on distinct policy paths. The Bloomberg Economic surprise index for Europe has seen a sharp decline in economic reports, slipping into negative territory, while the U.S. economic surprise index remains positive. Surprise indexes measure the amount by which economic data have fallen below or shot above analysts\u2019 consensus expectations.\nOn Monday, preliminary manufacturing and services PMI reports from the eurozone, Germany and France largely beat expectations. But IHS Markit indicated that the eurozone economy remains in a \u201clower gear\u201d as business-activity expansion has marked signs of weaker demand growth and supply constraint.\n\u201cThe inability of the euro area economy to deliver on growth expectations certainly seems to explain a large part of the outperformance versus Treasurys,\u201d said fixed-income strategists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nEurozone economic data has deteriorated compared with the U.S.\nThat could take pressure off the ECB to end its quantitative-easing program, which has included monthly bond purchases.\nThe yield differential between German and U.S. bonds ballooned after the ECB undertook its asset-purchasing program in 2015 even as the Fed sought to normalize monetary policy. So, if the ECB doesn\u2019t deliver on expectations to end its bond-buying by the end of the year, the yield gap between the U.S. and Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, is unlikely to narrow soon, market participants said.\nECB President Mario Draghi has insisted the September 2018 date touted as the end of its use of unconventional monetary policy remains open-ended. Consistently keeping one foot inside the camp for continued monetary easing, Draghi repeated the line that \u201can ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary\u201d on Friday.\nWith core inflation still muted, the ECB still lacks the impetus it needs to end its asset purchases, without casting doubt on the credibility of its lofty inflation target of 2%. Eurostat reported that year-over-year inflation rose to 1.3% in March from 1.1% in February.\nStill, the disappointing economic data only reflect the high expectations analysts have placed on the eurozone\u2019s prospects after the currency bloc\u2019s impressive momentum in 2017"}
