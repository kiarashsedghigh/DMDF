John and Mary loom large over everything the brothers do, from their dedication to hunting to their commitment to family. Even though they\u2019re gone for major parts of the show, John and Mary maintain a place in the boys\u2019 hearts and minds. They think about what their parents were like and what actions they would take \u2014 and they dream about the way things might have been had their family\u2019s lives never become entangled with the supernatural. Sam and Dean were forged in loss and it was the original loss of their mother when they were young that set the foundation for their lives moving forward.\nYet, John and Mary had lives of their own, full of ups and downs, hopes and dreams. Their life together wasn\u2019t always easy but it was as normal as they come. And it was exactly what they both wanted.\nWhile Sam and Dean's early childhood represented what could have been for them, the truth of their parents\u2019 lives was actually much more complicated. Throughout Supernatural, fans have learned about the ways John and Mary fought for the life they wanted \u2014 and rose above difficult circumstances, often while being tracked by demons, to live in peace \u2014 at least for a while.\nHere are 25 Crazy Revelations Behind John and Mary\u2019s Relationship.\nYears after they are both gone, Sam and Dean meet a cupid who informs them that John and Mary couldn\u2019t stand each other when they first met. A cupid had to be called in to make sure they fell in love, and after he worked his magic, they were the perfect couple.\nHowever, the story John told his sons about how he met their mother was a little different. In that story, Mary ran into John on March 23, 1972 after seeing a movie, knocking him down in the process. To make it up to him, Mary took him to get a coffee. After talking and discovering John liked Led Zeppelin, John asked for her number. The rest is history. Of the two stories, John, Mary, and their sons, clearly prefer the second one.\nThe fact that a cupid had to get involved to ensure John and Mary fell in love made it clear that someone had a vested interest in them getting together. According to the cupid that Sam and Dean met, the pairing of John and Mary was a very big deal in heaven.\nAlthough Mary was in love with John and knew he was planning to propose, her father was never on board with the relationship. John was well aware of Mary\u2019s father\u2019s disapproval and believed it was because he was a small-town mechanic from a family of mechanics. However, Mary insisted that it really had nothing to do with John \u2014 her father was just protective of her.\nLater, it becomes clear that Mary\u2019s hunter father\u2019s objections stemmed from John being a na\u00efve civilian. Both Mary\u2019s parents believed John couldn\u2019t protect or partner with Mary against mystical forces, leaving them both vulnerable. Not to mention making him odd man out with their family.\nJohn was a corporal in the Marines and served in the Vietnam War. He met Mary after he got home. Unlike many that served in the war, however, John\u2019s time in Vietnam didn\u2019t seem to negatively impact him.\nIn fact, even after what he saw in the war, John stayed optimistic and still believed in love. Mary describes him as \u201ceverything a hunter isn\u2019t.\u201d It isn\u2019t until years later when Mary is taken from him that John'a attitude completely changes and he becomes the paran"}

{"idx": "31006", "prompt": "Continue the following text: How Big of a Risk Is Share-Based Compensation at Workday?\nWith a large portion of its compensation tied to equity awards, will Workday follow in the footsteps of LinkedIn?\nAlong with reporting GAAP profits, companies frequently report adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP profits which adjust for share-based compensation. The difference between the two numbers can be extensive. For example, below is a look at GAAP and non-GAAP net income reported by some popular tech names in their most recent quarters.\nIf options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?\nNot only is share-based compensation often misrepresented by managers, it also triggers a risk that is overlooked by investors. If the price of the stock goes down, whether it is related to the company itself or the overall market, there is a higher chance of decreasing morale and higher attrition. Although any company with a large portion of its compensation tied to equity is susceptible to this risk, one that sticks out to me is Workday.\nIn its most recent fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2016, Workday's share-based compensation of nearly $250 million accounted for 22% of total revenue. To put that into perspective, share-based compensation at Salesforce and Oracle are 9% and 3%, respectively. Now, imagine how much of the workforce is not going to be happy if the stock price is cut in half.\nIn case the motivational speech wasn't enough, Weiner forfeited his $14 million annual bonus and gave it as a bonus to employees.\nThe importance of keeping employees happy is important at Workday and LinkedIn. Both companies stress the role of culture to the success of their respective businesses. In its 10-K, LinkedIn singles out its values and unique company culture as the foundation of its success. In Workday's annual report, the company mentions the failure of maintaining its company culture as a risk to its business.\nRegardless of recent negativity surrounding LinkedIn and Workday, both companies still score well on Glassdoor. Of the LinkedIn employees who rated it on Glassdoor, 89% would recommend it to a friend and 98% rank its CEO favorably. In fact, Weiner was the 5th highest rated CEO of 2016. For Workday, 73% of employees would recommend the company to a friend while 94% approve of Bhusri.\nWhat happens if the price drops?\nAlthough it is pure speculation on my part, I believe one of the reasons LinkedIn sold itself to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was because it was in danger of losing its highly valued employees. A price drop over 40% likely left many employee options worthless, especially the newer ones.\nThe company granted over 280,000 stock options during fiscal year 2015. The average price of those options was $259 per share. According to company filings, LinkedIn had 683,788 or 47% of all options outstanding that had a weighted exercise price over $170 per share. On the day of the announcement of the sale, LinkedIn shares popped 47% from $131 per share to over $192, bringing many of those options in the money.\nOver the last 4 years, the amount of share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue at LinkedIn climbed from 9% to "}

This failure fits into a larger media pattern of ignoring Muslims when discussing issues that are particularly impactful to them, while at the same time painting false portraits based on stereotypes. Given how few Americans actually know a Muslim person -- and that the religion is already incredibly vilified -- cable news would do better to follow the precedent set by print media and highlight personal stories from Muslims who have been impacted by the ban.\nIn the week after Trump signed the executive order, prime-time cable news programs hosted 176 guests (some repeat) for significant discussions about the policy, but only 14 guest appearances were Muslim. CNN hosted seven Muslim guests while MSNBC hosted two. Fox News hosted five Muslims, all during the February 3 edition of The First 100 Days. Of CNN\u2019s guests, anchor Fareed Zakaria accounted for two of the seven appearances.\nThis failure falls into a broader pattern of cable news neglecting to present representative voices, especially of Muslims. In the 24 hours after the June 12, 2016, mass shooting in Orlando, FL, in which a Muslim man killed 49 people and injured 50 after opening fire at an LGBTQ nightclub, cable news hosted only a few Muslim guests. In the month after the election, only 21 percent of the guests who appeared on evening cable news to discuss Islam were Muslim.\nThe New York Times put together a series of vignettes about people impacted by the ban, including Fuad Shareef, who worked with American officials as a translator after the invasion of Iraq. After selling the family home and car and spending $5,000 on flights, he was told that he could not go as planned to resettle in the United States.\nBuzzFeed collected stories from LGBTQ refugees who \u201cfelt their dreams crushed as they heard the news\u201d of the ban. Hamid, a gay man who fled his home in Iran and was cleared to resettle in the U.S., told BuzzFeed that he was \u201cgoing to die here\u201d while hiding out in Turkey.\nMedia Matters used Nexis to search for all guests appearing on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. from January 30 through February 3 in segments where there was significant discussion of Trump\u2019s travel ban, using the phrases \"refugee,\" \"ban,\" \"Muslim,\" \"Islam,\" and \"vetting.\" Network anchors like Fareed Zakaria who appeared as a guest on a program that they did not anchor were coded as guests in the analysis.

That's how you say it.\nNo matter what, you will be identified and found out. I've often said you can't take the garbage out without someone coming up, saying hello and noting how many beer cans are in your recycling bag.\nPersonal recognition is practiced as an art form here. It carries a weight all its own.\nI think of my friend who joined a weight-reduction class in a Northwood church basement, the kind of class where a paid leader gives all sorts of pep talks and lessons in good nutrition and exercise.\nMy friend works downtown in a high-rise office building. The other morning she was thinking of all the advice from the weight-class instructor, but nevertheless gave into temptation and bought a coffee and gooey doughnut to take to her desk.\nThen the elevator door opened. In stepped her weight teacher, whose daytime job has nothing to do with fat intake and calorie watching. Quick thinking saved the day. My friend stuffed the doughnut in the elevator's light fixture. She figured the coffee wouldn't get her in trouble.\nThe weight instructor wasn't any the wiser at first. No lecture on the spot. The hidden pastry stayed hidden. But because we're in chatty Baltimore, one of my friend's friends carried the whole tale back to the instructor.\nBeware the medical profession. Not the doctors. It's the nurses, technicians and medical secretaries. You think your case is confidential. Think again.\nThis is Baltimore. The news of your troubled glands will be on the wires faster than a cable news alert. When it comes to the transmission of private medical news, Baltimore is a closed-circuit city.\nEven the physician's waiting room can be an occasion for this version of social interchange. You are there for a visit. So is someone else who is seen by the doctor before you are. This someone just happens to know you. Faster than you can say HMO, the word that you were in the waiting room and your reason for being there will be out and about. The doctor's secretary, who's friendly with the other patient, has passed on the information, and the patient has told people you both know.\nThe lessons of a Baltimore childhood taught me how quickly news travels.\nIn my school days the good nuns gave daily and weekly tests. The grades on those tests were more or less common knowledge among class members. I soon learned that average or high marks did not attract much attention. Doing well on an arithmetic quiz was not a matter of much conversational gravity. But just snag a failing 42 on a long-division quiz and that fact would reach home sooner than you did -- courtesy of a schoolmate who told his mother, who then quickly told your mother.\nIf tattling on the arithmetically challenged is hard on a 8-year-old, imagine the annoyance it brings a parent. It's one thing to have a kid flunk a math test, it's another to have the busybody members of the parents' club talk about it. After all, this is a school test, not the price of a share of stock falling. But I sometimes think Baltimoreans recall the 42s on math tests more than the fortunes lost on the stock market.\nIf you are an optimist and general good sport, Baltimore's penchant for telling all indicates to you that our city is a convivial, livable and lived-in place.\nI love those conversations across the"}

Unfortunately that confirmation came in the form of a Maryland CPS ruling against the parents for \u201cunsubstantiated child neglect\u201d. The Meitivs are now on a 5-year probationary period, during which any further unsupervised activity by their children could lead to additional charges.\nIt\u2019s generally agreed that playing outside is good for kids. Fresh air, sunlight, exercise, social interaction are all vital for proper childhood development. However, a growing herd of nanny-statists within the government, specifically state Child Protective Services agencies, have decided that playing outside without direct supervision is so dangerous that it would be better if children weren\u2019t raised by their own parents. They risk turning our children into a generation of physically stunted, psychologically addled wards of the state. But for their own good!\nIf you were lucky enough to be a kid in the 1990s, you\u2019re probably familiar with the urban planning megahit computer game series SimCity. It was first released in 1989 and spawned several sequels and spin-offs of varying popularity over the last two and a half decades, including the street-level, person-oriented, blockbuster Sims series.\nIf you were even luckier, you didn\u2019t emerge from playing these games as a flaming utopian. The point of the games, after all, is to make the citizens of your electronic town happy by providing them with adequately zoned neighborhoods, utilities, parks, a modest tax rate, entertainment, and safety from occasional disaster scenarios.\nThe original SimCity did have a marginal laissez-faire premise, though. As mayor, you zoned specific areas for residential, commercial, or industrial construction, but the computer programming filled in the blanks with whatever kind of buildings your citizens might want.\nHowever, a new version of the series for Android and Apple phones and tablets, SimCity BuildIt, removes all hints of spontaneous order and substitutes a Marxist paradise of master planning in its place. The new mobile game is rendered in smooth, stunning 3D graphics, so it\u2019s a pleasure to play visually. But once you start to get into the weeds of the new mayor\u2019s office, it becomes more of an annoyance than fun, especially as a lesson in economic theory.\nIn the wake of the now five-day long federal government partial shutdown, center-left pundits have wasted no time calling for drastic changes to the republic.\nMax Weber, in conversation with Gen.

Several company and organization representatives spoke Wednesday at the PTC's monthly meeting, demanding more action.\n\"If someone is operating illegally, we want something done,\" Dave Shaw, president of the West Florida Livery Association, said afterward. \"We pay for regulation so we expect the commission to regulate.\"\nThe PTC has the option of imposing fines ranging from $30 to $500 as well as the power to charge drivers with misdemeanors and impound their cars. But it prefers to warn them first.\n\"We are trying not to be heavy handed but be informative and help them see what the problem is,\" said the PTC's chairman, Hills\u00adborough County Commissioner Victor Crist.\nComplicating the situation, Crist said, is that Uber and Lyft are not the ones to be fined.\n\"These are local citizens who are just trying to make ends meet,\" Crist said. \"They are being misled, not informed and are putting themselves at risk of losing everything they have and they don't even know it.\"\nThe PTC plans to soon launch educational campaigns for drivers and riders, informing them of the risks both face.\nBecause drivers are using their own vehicles and personal insurance policies for commercial uses, they may be liable for any injuries resulting from accidents in their cars, Cockream said. Passengers may not realize they are not covered, either, he said.\nOn its website, Lyft advertises a $1,000,000 excess liability insurance policy covering passengers and third parties.\nAnd so far, the Tampa launch has been a success, said Lyft spokeswoman Paige Thelen.\n\"The Tampa community has embraced Lyft as an affordable, convenient and fun new way of getting around,\" Thelen said.\nRequests for comment from Uber \u2014 which operates UberX, the ride-sharing service that is available here \u2014 were not returned.\nThe companies are testing the PTC's regulations at a time the Legislature is considering limiting the agency's potency.

And hungry.\nSo the Minneapolis man went to Cub Foods in Oakdale and bought a Monster energy drink \u2014 but also slid $36 worth of steak, potatoes and other groceries into a bag and tried walking out the door.\nA security guard quickly caught him and Rusthoven was assigned a court date several months out. One he never made it to.\nSince then, an arrest warrant stemming from the petty theft has been hanging over his head.\nRusthoven was among about 50 people who chose to resolve outstanding non-violent misdemeanor warrants \u2014 and avoid jail time \u2014 by attending Ramsey County\u2019s first Warrant Resolution Event on Saturday. Judges, lawyers and sheriff\u2019s officials were on hand at Aldrich Arena in Maplewood from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. for citizens to clear up mistakes from their past.\nIn most cases, those minor warrants were wiped off the law breaker\u2019s records with a scheduled court date, a fine or even forgiveness.\nMore than a dozen people lined up outside the arena Saturday morning before the event opened for a chance at redemption. The arena floor, set up like a career fair, had designated tables for each segment of the justice system: court administration, probation, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges, even a court reporter.\nA steady stream of citizens trickled in throughout the day. One 25-year-old woman spent more than eight hours on a bus from Chicago to clear up her outstanding warrant for a 2009 petty theft.\nIn all, there are about 8,500 to 9,000 active warrants out in Ramsey County, Sheriff Matt Bostrom said last week. About half of those are for non-violent misdemeanors \u2014 unpaid parking tickets, disorderly conduct, petty theft. And half of those are more than four years old.\nThese unresolved minor warrants often clog up the criminal justice system, leading to an unnecessarily costly and embarrassing trip to jail for someone who did something fairly petty.

Last June, the president vented internally about wanting to fire Mr. Mueller, but was talked out of it.\nThe president once again railed against Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, for recusing himself in the Russia inquiry, and blasted the F.B.I. for failing to investigate Hillary Clinton, \u201cwhere there are crimes.\u201d He criticized Rod J.

The Rolling Jubilee earned the somewhat backhanded honor of being named \u201cone of the few good ideas to come out of Occupy Wall Street\u201d by Forbes.\nThe next edition of the The Debt Resistors\u2019 Operations Manual \u2014 currently in the works, and due to be finished next year \u2014 will have something that the original lacked: a chapter on climate change.\nWhy the shift? We recently spoke with Andrew Ross, professor of Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU, who became involved in Occupy in the early days of Zuccotti Park and helped to launch the Occupy Student Debt campaign before becoming a member of Strike Debt. Ross is the author of several books, most recently Creditocracy: The Case for Debt Refusal, which will be published this February by OR Books.\nQ. With all the large social issues that Occupy and Strike Debt have raised, why add climate change to the mix?\nA. Well, Strike Debt focuses on all kinds of debt: medical debt, housing debt, credit card debt. We started the Rolling Jubilee. We really wanted to publicize how the secondary debt market worked. A lot of people didn\u2019t know how cheaply their debts have been sold. How lenders are willing to sell your debt cheaply \u2014 but not to you. Knowing how cheaply your debt has been bought by the person who is trying to collect from you changes the dynamic. We hoped to raise $50,000, and now we\u2019ve raised about $630,000 \u2014 and abolished $15 million worth of debt.\nWhat changed is, Hurricane Sandy happened. A lot of Strike Debt people became involved in Occupy Sandy. It drove home links we\u2019d been talking about when we did the Strike Debt report. People were waiting for their FEMA loans and these predatory banks were circling around them.\nClimate debt isn\u2019t a part of the political discourse, but climate debt needs to be honored and repaid. It\u2019s unusual compared to other kinds of debt because it tends to be the more affluent populations that are the debtors.\nQ. And what are you moving towards?\nA. International legal recognition. We\u2019re trying to get high-carbon countries to acknowledge their responsibility.\nAt the U.N., the term of choice is \u201cclimate aid,\u201d which suggests that this is an act of benevolence on their part. They avoid anything that smacks of responsibility.\nThe decision to fast track climate financing by $30 billion in the three years after Copenhagen [PDF] is where it gets complicated. We should finance clean energy technology in developing countries, but in doing so, most of the emissions debt that we owe them is being paid back to us through their emissions cuts. And most of our carbon reductions so far have come from hyrdofracking for gas or from reduced industrial activity during the depression. There\u2019s a lot of slick accounting going on.\nThese emissions developments are a denial to poor countries of their atmospheric space. To fully acknowledge carbon debt is to acknowledge that it is the"}

It shouldn\u2019t be that way, given the organization\u2019s record, but experts say this is the gamble charities take by tying their fate to a celebrity.\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency stripped Armstrong of his victories Thursday after the cyclist notified the agency that he would no longer fight allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs, and would instead focus on other things, including his charitable endeavors. The agency also banned Armstrong for life from participating in sports and events sanctioned by groups that adopt the World Anti-Doping Agency code.\nHowever, in the case of Lance Armstrong\u2019s namesake foundation, the charity\u2019s reputation appears as stellar as the cyclist\u2019s in his heyday. The group received high marks from Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau\u2019s Wise Giving Alliance. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that there\u2019s a relationship between Lance the athlete and the particular work of the foundation,\u201d says H. Art Taylor, president and chief executive of the BBB Wise Giving Alliance. Its finances are solid, and as long as the foundation continues to operate effectively, there\u2019s no reason for those ratings to change, he says.\nAccording to the most recent data available, contributions to the foundation during 2010 \u2014 the year doping allegations first came to light \u2014 fell 27% from 2009, to $29.7 million. Total revenue, however, rose 1.1% that year to $42.3 million. Earlier this month, executives told USA Today that donations this year were up 20% compared with the last two years, and the average amount donated rose from $72 to $75.\nDown the line, donors should keep an eye on not just whether the charity is bringing in less, but if a change in its finances has made it less effective than other charities offering similar services, Miniutti says. That\u2019s a better indication of whether or not to make a donation."}

One in four adults reported eating fast food in a study published in the April 2004 issue of the \u201cJournal of the American College of Nutrition.\u201d But eating too much fast food can have health consequences. A number of studies have linked fast food to health problems, including an increased risk of obesity, poor nutrition, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It\u2019s wise to limit consumption of fast food to reduce the health risks.\nIn a large study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the January 2005 issue of \u201cLancet,\u201d young adults who consumed fast food more than twice a week gained 10 more pounds than those who had fast food less than once a week. The study in the April 2004 issue of the \u201cJournal of American College of Nutrition\u201d found that adults ages 20 and older who frequently ate fast food had higher body mass indexes than those who consumed fast food less frequently. A small order of fries and a large hamburger at a fast food outlet has about 800 calories, and sweetened soft drinks, which are often sold with fast food meals, have been linked to obesity in several studies.\nData from more than 17,000 adults and children analyzed and published in the October 2003 issue of the \u201cJournal of the American Dietetic Association\u201d showed that those who frequently consumed fast food had lower intakes of vitamins A and C, dietary fiber, milk and fruits and vegetables than subjects who didn\u2019t eat fast food. The fast-food eaters also had higher intakes of calories, saturated fat and sodium than the other subjects. Consumption of carbonated soft drinks was more than double for the frequent fast food eaters, who also consumed more than twice the amount of fried potatoes as those who didn\u2019t eat fast food. Filling up on fat-laden fast food and sugary soft drinks leaves little room for more nutritious fare that supports good health.\nEating fast food more than twice a week doubled the incidence of insulin resistance, a risk factor for diabetes, in the 2005 study published in \u201cLancet,\u201d and a 2010 Harvard report linked sweetened soft drinks with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, the risk of stroke may be related to the number of fast food restaurants in a neighborhood, according to a study published in the \u201cAnnals of Neurology\u201d in 2009. The study found the risk of stroke increased by 1 percent for every fast food restaurant in a Texas neighborhood. Fast food is loaded with sodium, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.\nTo reduce fast food health risks, the American Heart Association recommends visiting the websites of fast food chains to identify the healthiest choices and avoiding super-sizing your order, which increases the amount of fat, sodium, sugar and calories you\u2019ll consume. A grilled chicken sandwich is a good choice \u2013 the American Heart Association says it will be leaner than the meat used in most burgers. Skip deep-fried sides, such as fries, and order a small salad; drink water, low-fat milk or diet soda instead of sweetened soft drinks. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics noted in 2012 that fast food menus are becoming healthier and more varied, so choose fast food carefully.\nSheehan, Jan. \"Fast Food Health Risk Facts.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/fast"}

{"idx": "31053", "prompt": "Continue the following text: This is the Duolingo owl. He helps you learn languages for free online, and teaches me all about how to use the Web for teaching and learning.\nHere is an example of the language skill tree for Spanish. This is a familiar image for anyone who\u2019s played a video game with a skill tree.\nDuolingo uses what\u2019s called gamification to teach languages. Gamification is a hot topic right now for education, and it works through changing an activity into a more game-like interaction so that learning, or whatever you\u2019re doing, is more fun. Duolingo does this through giving you points for finishing lessons and passing tests, which increases your level. You also have three hearts during each lesson, and you lose one heart each time you give a wrong answer \u2014 if you run out of hearts, you have to start the lesson over. It also has lesson topics arranged in a skill tree, like in a video game. You can also play and compete with friends via linking up your Facebook account, but I haven\u2019t tested that out yet.\nThe gamification of Duolingo is pretty effective. I thought at first that it was a little silly, and that applying a set of rules to learning like this would be annoying, but I was wrong. Somehow, it does make the learning process more enjoyable. I don\u2019t know how this would work in other subjects other than language learning, or in subjects that require more than memorizing and lots of practice with the memorized words and grammar.\nHere an example of the instant feedback you get when answering a question. Here, I did an exercise where I listened to a phrase in Spanish, then typed it in Spanish. When I submitted my response, Duolingo told me it was correct, and it also showed me the English translation.\nOne of the benefits of online learning via something like a MOOCs is the ability to include Web applications that give instant feedback. Instant feedback helps reinforce correct answers quickly, and let you know when you get something wrong, so that learners are less likely to remember wrong answers as correct. Learners that get immediate feedback also can more easily judge for themselves how much and how well they\u2019ve learned, giving them more control over their own learning.\nWith Duolingo, when you either take a test or go through a lesson, you immediately find out whether you\u2019ve answered a question correctly. The Web application responds to your answer, and tells you exactly what you got wrong, for example, that you got the gender of a noun wrong, or you translated a word incorrectly.\nDuolingo also lets you hover your cursor over any word and it will give you a translation (although not while taking a test, of course). This lets you try to figure out an answer yourself, but then look at the translation if you\u2019re having trouble. This doesn\u2019t let you completely off the hook, though, since it doesn\u2019t help you with verb conjugations or word order when trying to answer a question. It is really helpful that you can do this, however, because it lets you look right away at a word and its translation, helping form that connection between the two. This helps you build a sense of control over your learning that other methods might not give you.\nAnother handy trick of the Web application is the ability to customize your lesson. Rather than working out of, say, a workbook, where all students have the same questions, Duolingo can quiz you more on words that you\u2019ve gotten wrong in the past. When you take a lesson, it also lets you know when you are encountering a new word by highlighting it in yellow. The new words often appear with \u201ceasier\u201d exercises: seeing the English translation, hearing the word in Spanish, and having to identify the correct image"}

The pound bounced back against the dollar on Tuesday night amid optimism that article 50 would be prolonged and that the prospect of a disorderly severance from Brussels had receded.\nSpeaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, the governor said investors were following developments in parliament closely to detect shifts in the direction of Brexit. The reaction of EU officials and governments across the continent was also being watched closely.\nCarney said a \u201csharp rebound in sterling following the vote\u201d was the main indicator that some investors believed Brexit could be delayed beyond the end of March.\nHis comments came as the prime minister, Theresa May, left the door open to extend the article 50 negotiation period, in an answer to the Tory MP Kenneth Clarke, who said that everyone he met on the doorstep wanted to stay inside the EU\u2019s customs union.\nMay did not rule out delaying article 50 or ever joining a customs union permanently.\nPeter Altmaier, a close ally of Angela Merkel in Germany\u2019s government, said a request to extend article 50 would be given serious consideration. \u201cWhen parliament needs more time, then this is something that will have to be considered by the European council, and personally I would see that as a reasonable request,\u201d he told the BBC.\nThe pound fell below $1.27 after May lost the vote, but quickly recovered to hit $1.29. On Wednesday sterling settled around $1.28 and also remained steady against the euro at \u20ac1.13.\nCarney insisted he was not giving his own opinion of how Brexit would develop. He was only citing the market\u2019s initial take, and how it was expressed. The issue remained in the hands of parliament.\nMPs asked the governor about the bank\u2019s stress test scenarios, which included an assessment of a disorderly no-deal Brexit that would trigger an 8% collapse in GDP. Threadneedle Street has come under fire from Brexiters, who said the scenarios exaggerated the likely impact of a no-deal departure.\nThe Labour MP Catherine McKinnell asked how realistic it was to include an increase in interest rates to 4% in the worst-case scenario, when the more likely reaction of the bank would be to cut rates, as it did following the 2008 financial crash.\nCarney said the increase was to preserve the ability of banks to lend in the midst of a crisis and to keep Britain attractive to international investors.\nHowever, McKinnell said an increase in interest rates would likely harm the economy more than it would help the banks, hurting consumer confidence and fuelling rises in unemployment and home repossessions."}

U.S. soldiers rushed to the scene to help, including some wearing only T-shirts or shorts under their body armor.\nAn Islamic militant group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out by a new suicide unit formed in response to reports that the U.S. plans to keep permanent bases and troops in Afghanistan even after the 2014 deadline for the end of the foreign combat mission. Hezb-e-Islami said its fighters had stalked the Americans for a week to learn their routine before striking.\nIt was the deadliest attack to rock the Afghan capital in more than two months and followed a series of other attacks against Americans that has made May the deadliest month for international forces this year. U.S.-led forces are increasingly leaving the fighting to their Afghan counterparts and focusing more on training mission in a bid to prepare the government forces to take over their own security after the international combat mission ends by the end of 2014.\nThe explosion was powerful enough to rattle buildings on the other side of the city, and left body parts scattered on the street.\nCmdr. Bill Speaks, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Secretary, confirmed that two American soldiers were killed, while international security company DynCorp International said four of its American civilian contractors were among the dead. DynCorp International said its employees were working with U.S. forces training the Afghan military when the blast occurred.\nNine Afghan civilians also were killed, including two children, and 35 people were wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Kanishka Beektash Torkystani said.\nThe deaths pushed the monthly toll for the U.S.-led coalition to 18, making May the deadliest month so far this year. By comparison, 44 international troops were killed in the same period last year, reflecting the fact that the overall number of deaths has dropped as Afghan forces increasingly take the lead.\nThe suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden car at about 8 a.m., Kabul provincial police spokesman Hashmad Stanakzi said. \u201cThe explosion was very big. It set the nearby buildings on fire,\u201d he said.\nKabul Deputy Police Chief Daud Amin said it was difficult to count the dead because the blast tore apart many of the bodies.\nIt was the bloodiest attack in the Afghan capital since March 9, when suicide bombers struck near the Afghan Defense Ministry while U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was visiting.\nA spokesman for Hizb-e-Islami, Haroon Zarghoon, told The Associated Press that one of the movement\u2019s operatives carried out the attack on two vehicles of U.S. advisers.\nZarghoon says the militant group has formed a new cell to carry out suicide attacks on U.S. and other coalition troops.\n\u201cThe cell had been monitoring the movement and timing of the American convoy for a week and implemented the plan Thursday morning,\u201d Zarghoon said.\nHe said the cell was established in response to reports that the U.S. plans to keep permanent bases and troops in Afghanistan even after the NATO withdrawal.\nThe U.S. has said it wants no permanent bases in Afghanistan after 2014, but Afghan President Hamid Karzai raised eyebrows last week when he announced he had agreed to an American request to keep nine bases.\nA small American force is expected to remain"}

{"idx": "31063", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The recent revelations in connection with the Brexit campaign raise questions of the utmost seriousness for the functioning of our democracy. The whistleblower Sahmir Sanni has alleged that there was extensive collusion between the Vote Leave campaign and Be-Leave, an organisation also campaigning for the UK to leave the EU and for which Sanni was Treasurer and Secretary.\nSanni alleges that Be-leave was established by Vote Leave and that the money which it donated was in effect under the control of senior members of Vote Leave staff. Sanni also alleges that after the referendum, Vote Leave staff destroyed all electronic data relating to the interconnection between the two campaigns.\nIf these allegations of collusion are true then they amount to a serious breach of the regulations and a de facto fusion of the two campaign groups. This would result in an illegal overspend by as much as 10% of the statutory cap. It is too soon yet to draw firm conclusions that Vote Leave broke the rules. But there are clearly reasons to worry.\nThe Law on Referendums does not prevent donations from one campaign body to another. But it does forbid collusion between them. Otherwise there would not be a level playing field between the two sides in any referendum. If one campaign exceeds the spending cap by deliberately spawning satellite operations then that crucial principle of equity is lost.\nThis is in itself is worrying, and if the allegations directed at Vote Leave are proven to be true yet another example of how money distorts our democracy. But the implication of senior Government Ministers and the response of the Prime Minister herself are further cause for concern.\nAs is well known, Vote Leave was headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. The pair arguably owe their membership of the British Cabinet to their role in the Brexit campaign. The Government is up to their neck in this. Theresa May also saw fit to defend her Political Secretary, who shamefully dragged Mr Sanni\u2019s personal life into the spotlight.\nIt demeans politics to attempt to destroy a whistleblower\u2019s case not by addressing the matters which are being raised, but by insinuating a malicious personal motive on the part of the whistleblower. And it demeans the office of Prime Minister to tacitly endorse such actions.\nIn truth, we could not even discuss this issue if it were not for Mr Sanni\u2019s bravery and the hard work of diligent, and honest journalists: a profession which politicians rarely thank.However uncomfortable it may be for the powerful, a functioning democracy needs people like these.\nBut Mr Sanni has been treated unfairly, and our democracy has suffered as a result.\nYet democracy depends on more than just journalists and their sources. It needs transparency and a rules-based level playing field. If these attributes are missing then our democracy will be in severe danger. The stakes have never been higher, as the referendum was a major turning point in this country\u2019s history.\nGiven this, we must have a proper and urgent investigation. But the truth is that MPs or the Government itself should not be the ones to carry this out. Through it\u2019s connections to Vote Leave and the actions of the Prime Minister, the Government have effectively discounted themselves as honest brokers.\nAny investigation must be the remit of the Electoral Commission. But at present they are under-resourced and lack the necessary powers to carry out such a task. After all, look at the situation last week with the Information Commissioner.

{"idx": "31068", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: After an arduous seven-week ocean voyage from England, followed by six \"very tedious\" days travelling the short distance from Montreal to Prescott, Ontario, an exhausted George Hills, his wife, Ann, and their six children finally arrived in Ancaster, Ontario, in the summer of 1832. Like any good son, Hills promptly wrote home.\n\"Dear father and mother, we left you almost broken-hearted, but you may be satisfied that we have bettered our condition by coming here,\" he wrote. \"I got work the first day I was here and have had plenty of work ever since\u2026 I know that a poor man can do a great deal better here than he can at home.\" Despite his optimism, however, Hills reminded mom and dad that his new life included \"a good many hardships.\" Besides the gruelling journey, he noted \"we work here from sunrise to sunset.\"\nThe Hills were among the first of 1,800 \"Petworth emigrants\"\u2014poor labourer families from Sussex, in southern England, sent to Canada by the Earl of Egremont to relieve poverty on his lands. Hills's letter recounts a quintessentially Canadian journey of hardship and hard work in the search for a better life.\nToday, economic opportunities still vary widely by geography. Despite a national unemployment rate that recently hit a 40-year low, provincial rates range from 14.7% in Newfoundland to 4.6% in British Columbia. In other words, anyone who finds themselves out of work in one province could probably find better prospects simply by moving. Despite our claim to be a nation of hard-working immigrants, however, these days Canadians seem increasingly incapable of putting that concept into practice. Most Canadians would rather stay put, regardless of where the jobs are.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the annual rate of interprovincial migration has fallen by more than half since the early 1970s. Internal migration once exceeded international immigration to Canada by a huge margin; today, more people arrive from outside our borders each year than move between provinces. If unemployed Canadians were prepared to pull up stakes to find work, economic logic dictates employment, earnings and growth rates would eventually equalize across the entire country. Yet such gaps are a permanent fixture of the Canadian experience.\nThere are plenty of theories for Canada's severe case of stay-at-home-itis. Generous transfer payments\u2014particularly those sweetened employment insurance (EI) benefits the federal Liberals provided for Atlantic Canadians in the last election\u2014are often blamed for keeping unemployed workers at home. Provincial reluctance to recognize occupational credentials from other jurisdictions is another common complaint. And while American rates of interstate mobility are substantially higher than in Canada, the same relentless downward trend is also in play south of the border. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the internal migration rate has fallen to its lowest level since tracking began in 1948. Many American observers theorize this is due to skyrocketing housing prices, a suggestion that seems equally applicable to Canada.\nThe problem with all these perfectly plausible explanations, however, is that they're just guesses about why workers are increasingly reluctant to move. To solve this riddle once and for all, Statscan finally decided to go straight to the source. \"If you were offered a job in another province, would there be anything standing in your way of accepting that job offer?\" the 2016 census inquired of unemployed Canadians. It's the first time such a question has been asked. The replies are surprising, and utterly depress"}
{"idx": "31069", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: With a business model untethered from opening weekend box office and high variable P&A spend, the streamer has established the foundation necessary to revolutionize the model of creating and distributing original feature films.\nTectonic shifts in large industries do not announce their arrival with an earthquake. Instead, they begin quietly, with a low grumble. Facebook began as an online social directory for Ivy League students; it now dominates the digital advertising market. Amazon started modestly, selling books on the internet; today it sells everything to everyone. A similar phenomenon is taking place in the film industry. Slowly, but relentlessly, Netflix is building what will become the world\u2019s largest, and most valuable, movie business.\nTo many, that prediction will seem sensational and absurd. After all, Netflix\u2019s film output to date has generally underwhelmed critics, and aside from a few summer rom-com hits, has failed to reach the zeitgeist in the same way as its television programming.\nBut when a business does something new, there is often too much focus on what it looks like today, rather than what it can become. With ubiquitous global internet distribution, and a business model untethered from opening weekend box office and high variable P&A spend, Netflix has established the foundation necessary to revolutionize the model of creating and distributing original feature films.\nOf course, a strong business model means little if the business is not motivated by a higher purpose. It is here that Netflix enjoys the qualitative edge that will elevate its film business above all prospective competitors. This is because Netflix\u2019s film business is driven by two simple, but power ideas: 1) provide consumers with a better movie-viewing experience; 2) provide all consumers access to great movies.\nAs a business, movies thrive when consumers receive a great movie-going experience. Theaters seek to delight consumers with spectacular sight and sound, comfortable seating, and tasty treats. But delivering a wonderful consumer experience is broader than large screens, reclining chairs and popcorn. A sublime consumer experience must satisfy the full scope of physical and psychological needs of the customer by accommodating modern behaviors and expectations. It is here that the theater experience cannot compete with Netflix.\nIn movie theaters, customers cannot check their Instragram, cannot respond to texts, cannot chat with friends and are unable to go to the bathroom without fear of missing a key plot point. In contrast, Netflix movie-watchers can discuss scenes with friends, post to social media and pause the film to take a bathroom break. These actions may repulse movie purists, but they liberate consumers with total control. And once a consumer has tasted total control, competing experiences that suppress impulses, and levy penalties on instinctive behavior, begin to feel repressive and suffocating. Over time, consumer affection, time and money will migrate to the movie provider that delivers the most control.\nEqually important to the success of Netflix\u2019s growing film initiative is a commitment to expand access to movies to all people. Access to movies is often taken for granted by people that can easily afford to go to the movies, have enough free time to go to the movies or live near a movie theater. Access is also taken for granted by people who are accustomed to finding films to watch that suit their tastes and sensibilities. The degree of privilege that a person enjoys plays a big part in determining the level of access that the person has to movies.\nBy making its original films available globally to all customers at no added financial or emotional cost, Netflix is affirming a commitment to make movies more accessible, regardless of geography or socioeconomic standing. While critics and peers sneer at some of the movies that Netflix has chosen to"}

What's it all about?\nMiller is like any niche celebrity, in that if you've heard about her before now, you're probably a fan. She's an astrologer whose website, AstrologyZone, attracts 6 million visitors per month with free horoscopes. She's published nine books, presented at the Apple Store in Soho, and has columns in ten international fashion magazines, including Elle. The fashion world is Miller's specialty. She collaborates with brands (suggesting colors for Calypso St. Barth sweaters, doing in-store classes at Furla) and counts designers, stylists, and editors among her most ardent devotees. An anecdote I heard from Emily Barnes, a stylist, characterizes it well: \"I discovered her when I was shooting a campaign for Bloomingdale's in New York. It was the first of the month, when Susan puts her horoscopes up, and the studio literally didn't start shooting until everyone had read their Susan \u00adMiller.\" At parties hosted by publicist Kelly Cutrone, an attendee told me, \"the best seat in the house is always the seat closest to Susan.\" When Cynthia Rowley learned that her friend the fashion designer Chrissie Miller is Susan's daughter, she flipped. \"I could have died. It was like hearing \u2018Meryl Streep is my mom.'\u2005\"\nPeople really take her seriously, from Rihanna's stylist to the LA-based culture writer at a fashion website who told us an unbelievable anecdote that highlights how fervent Miller's acolytes are. \"When I was offered my current job, Mercury was in retrograde, and I told my potential future bosses that I probably should wait to commit,\" she recounted. \"And they didn't even ask why. One of them said: Susan Miller? And I said: Yep. And she said: Of course.\"\nThe writer added that her popularity is no mystery; women have always passed along the names of the best waxer, the best facialist, the best dentist, and so on. \"If you're into astrology and someone with taste says, Here is the person I trust, you trust them.\"\nA Manhattan-based fashion editor who says her colleagues are obsessed with Miller had some other ideas. \"Most astrologers are terrible writers,\" she said. \"Susan is the most literate, and writes the most, and writes about the things that matter most to working women in New York City: money, love, signing contracts, etc.\" She also thinks Susan's technical rhetoric appeals to Type-A women. \"Reading her stuff and learning how to understand those star charts is a hobby,\" she explained.\nOf course, I couldn't help but check my horoscope after reading this. Virgos: \"Turning to your work life, you have quite an exciting month. It appears a very new assignment is coming in, and because it will be brought to you by planets in Aquarius, it seems that this assignment will be a jewel in your crown.\" OMG, Susan Miller totally knew I was going to write about her."}

Instead, these tears came from both students and parents as they watched the rest of the class go inside the high school to graduate.\n\"We got mothers out here crying, it's heartbreaking,\" said senior Teyon Scanlan.\n\"This was not the graduation I was looking forward to being at, but I have to accept it,\u201d said parent Harvey Ballard.\nIPS says students went too far with a class prank Tuesday night, writing on walls, setting off a fire alarm and fire extinguisher. There was syrup, food and trash left throughout the school.\n\"Vandalism is a crime. Those students and parents are being punished accordingly,\u201d said Carrie Cline-Black, speaking on behalf of IPS.\nMany of the students say they simply hung up balloons and wrote on doors with cake icing, but were gone by the time others caused real damage.\n\"It kind of got out of hand and the consequence was all of us suffering and not being able to walk,\" said Shandon Boyd, a senior.\nAmong those banned from the ceremony was Zack Owns, a member of the Crispus Attucks state championship basketball team and class vice president.\nYolanda Wilkins, Zack's mother, said her son will still be celebrating the accomplishment he earned.\n\"He may not physically be there. He is going to be at the school he\u2019s supposed to graduate. He earned his diploma with a 3.9 (GPA),\" she said.\nThe students did walk, though. It was in an impromptu ceremony inside the neighboring church Thursday evening.\nHawthorne, who took part in the prank, still gave her graduation speech, albeit to a smaller audience than she first planned.\n\"I know that this experience has made this particular group closer than ever,\" Hawthorne said. \"My message was learning from your past and making sure that your losses turn into lessons.\"\nShe also told the small group of seniors, \"much love, peace and many blessings.\"\nFor these students, the loss of their graduation ceremony was a final lesson in their high school careers, many of them felt was too harsh, but one they had no choice but to learn from.\n\"As long as I get my diploma, that's all that matters to me at this point,\" said Boyd.\nThe students will get their diplomas after helping with a school beautification service project. At this point, the district says no one is facing any criminal charges and students won't have to pay for the cleanup that took place because of the prank. The cost of that clean-up is still being calculated.\n\"Indianapolis Public Schools is aware that on Tuesday, June 6, a group of Crispus Attucks students and multiple adults vandalized various areas of the school building, a local and national historical landmark, in an effort to carry out a \"senior prank.\" The matter is under investigation by IPS Police.

Pictured are Michael Starzynski and Shawnell Tillery.\nThe Buffalo Quickies are the Alleyway Theatre\u2019s annual lineup of short plays. Now in its 28th year, this year\u2019s roster features eight plays, all by local playwrights, most of whom attended the opening, giving the event a happy buzz.\nThe personality of the annual Quickies is defined as much by the ensemble of actors as by the plays. This year\u2019s quick and able crew includes Stephanie Bax, making a sixth appearance in the festival; Dylan Brozyna; Jaimee Harmon; Mike Starzynski, appearing for the 13th time; Shawnell Tillery; and Andrew Zuccari. These actors gamely dive into the material, entering as new characters whenever needed, and shifting the scenery between plays.\nThe evening opens with veterans Starzynski and Bax in \u201cOne Man Show,\u201d by Mike Randall. Starzynski plays an actor portraying Aaron Burr in a solo performance. He\u2019s barely gotten started when a heckler, played by Bax, begins to taunt him from the audience. She turns out to be an old and reliably unsupportive friend.\nIt\u2019s an entertaining conceit. It\u2019s also somewhat traditional to begin (and sometimes to end) the Quickies with something meta-theatrical. Starzynski and Bax easily land the comedy and get us off to an amusing start, under the direction of Samantha Marchant.\nShawnell Tillery, left, and Jaimee Harmon star in one of the Buffalo Quickies one-act plays.\nMost of the evening\u2019s plays have been directed by Joyce Stilson. Carly Weiser has directed two. Samantha Marchant and Stephanie Riso have each directed one. They have given the event an even tone and pace.\nIt is not unusual, even for short plays, to run through their clever setups before they\u2019ve run their brief length. That happens several times during this installment of the Quickies. Not all of the shifting furniture between plays is handled with equal ease and efficiency, either. In the main, however, the evening is brisk and amusing.\nFor many, the obvious highlight of the evening will be \u201cA Work Break Downtown,\u201d by Jeff Z. Klein. The play is set atop the Liberty Building in downtown Buffalo. Here, for nearly 100 years, twin statues of Liberty, one facing east, the other facing west, have symbolized the greatness of our city. The image was instantly recognizable to the audience, who began to vocalize approval even before the lights had come up after intermission.\nKlein brings these statues to life as they discuss the current Buffalo Renaissance. The catch? One statue is white and faces downtown, the waterfront, and Canada. The other is African American and faces the East Side.\nTillery plays \u201cEast Facing Woman,\u201d and Harmon plays \u201cWest Facing Woman.\u201d Stephanie Riso directs.\nJennifer Tromble\u2019s \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d offers us Noel Coward\u2019s \u201cPrivate Lives\u201d as seen through the eyes of Sam Shepard.

The event is a repeat of the first summit seven years ago, which began a thaw in relations.\nBoth countries have participated in four years of multinational talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear programs in exchange for aid and diplomatic rewards. China, Russia, Japan, and the United States have also taken part.\nU.S. officials say those six-nation talks remain the \"center of gravity\" of nuclear diplomacy, but they support the summit.\nSome experts have expressed concern the one-on-one meeting could dilute or even undermine the multinational process.\nRhee Bong-jo is president of the South Korean government-funded Korean Institute for National Unification. He rejects those concerns.\nHe says it was progress in the six-party nuclear diplomacy that made the summit possible in the first place.\nNorth Korea promised the other five nations in February it would shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in exchange for energy assistance.

Technical working groups are sorting out the details of the second phase, and the six-party delegates are expected to meet again next month in Beijing.\nMany North Korea experts and political analysts in South Korea say politics may be driving the summit.

When it comes to public interest and attention during this moment of economic strain, Washington, D.C., the distributor of income, seems easily to outstrip business, the creator of the income marked for distribution. \"Seems,\" I said. A Google search \"proves\" nothing. It merely suggests what many people are talking about -- such as our national lurch toward central direction.\nThe present perception is one we might characterize as relief that Congress and the White House have consented to restore happiness and good livin'.\nWe focus on government, partly because its check-writing authority is so large, partly because, due to that authority, Americans wait longer and more intently than they used to for the federal government to tell them what to do.\nMy point? Not that government wouldn't receive universal opprobrium for failing to help out; rather, that, as quickly as possible, government should stop helping, and then reverse course. Back to the past! Bigger government than we had, when the Obama administration began, we plainly don't need. In economic affairs, private reliably beats public.\nThe great myth presently circulating among us, threatening to ossify into reality, is that for the mess we're in we can mainly blame the deregulatory policies of the past couple of decades, along with tax cuts during the Bush years. Such policies (according to the myth-makers) embody the wild and crazy notion that those who create the money in the first place, through investment and work, are entitled to the largest share of it, and that redistribution of resources by government (including money available for bonuses) is a lousy idea.\nRepudiating those notions is in large part what the \"stimulus\" bill is about. Taxes don't get raised for the present, but Congress and the White House create from thin air vast new spending programs that someone has to pay for at some point, through tax increases, inflation, or, likelier, both. Meanwhile, where does the new spending go? Where Congress says it goes, with minimal regard to need or merit: mostly just to the politics of the budget-writers.\nTrue, that's how the politics of spending always has worked. It's more the size the commitment (nearly $800 billion) than the novelty of it that disturbs. Federal spending, which accounts for 21 percent of the national wealth, is headed toward 30 percent. If you like Big Government, you're in luck.\nWe keep hearing from the Democrats that we have to do things this way because the old \"theories\" of slow government growth and encouragement of the private sector have been shown up. Why, just look! Indeed, let's look. Among other outrages we see Congress encouraging the reckless provision of home mortgages to people who can't make the payments. We see the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates artificially low, hence subsidizing many of the crazy loans and loan bundles we now complain about. We see new government spending programs (e.g., prescription drugs for Medicare patients) on every hand.\nNo political party causes an economic smash-up. We know Republicans got drunk on the same punch as everyone else. Beat 'em with a buggy whip in that case. Only let's not mistake Big Government intervention,"}

Find out what sent its shares higher by double-digits in February and whether the stock is worth your investment dollars.\nWhat: Shares of GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cannabinoid-based therapies, roared higher by 11% in February, based on data from S&P Capital IQ, after the company reported its first-quarter results and updated shareholders on its product pipeline progress.\nSo what: According to the Feb. 4 early morning earnings release, GW Pharmaceuticals reported approximately $12.4 million in revenue, a bit below the $13 million the Street had been looking for, but its loss of just $0.27 per share absolutely crushed Wall Street's significantly wider forecasted loss of $1.25 per share.\nMore important than the narrower-than-expected loss was GW Pharmaceuticals' pipeline update. Based on the company's latest timeline, it expects to report part B of its phase 2/3 study of Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome before the end of 2015 as well as commence a phase 3 study on Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and two phase 3 studies with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in Q1. Additionally, two additional phase 3 studies for Sativex as a treatment for cancer pain are expected to be out in the second-half of 2015, along with phase 2a data for GWP42003 as a treatment for schizophrenia.\nNow what: With consumers' perception of marijuana rapidly changing toward the positive, and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy admitting that marijuana could have medically beneficial properties, the momentum behind marijuana stocks seems unstoppable. Unfortunately, the valuations behind these companies are akin to \"trading under the influence.\"\nKeep in mind that GW Pharmaceuticals' lone approved product, Sativex, indicated for spasticity associated with epilepsy, has been a huge disappointment in overseas markets, and it's not approved in the U.S. Not to mention, Sativex failed miserably in the first of its three late-stage U.S. clinical studies for cancer pain. Even if Epidiolex hits the mark in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, physicians might be gun-shy about prescribing it due to the unknown effects of long-term cannabinoid use for children. There's also a veritable sea of negative study data compiled over the past three decades on the health effects of using marijuana that could make it difficult for GW's products to catch on with physicians.\nOf course, there's also a positive side here, too. Marijuana has been shown to have positive effects on the body in some studies, and that's certainly worth exploring. The question, though, is whether or not there's a good or smart way for investors to take advantage of that potential surge in medical marijuana use -- and as of now I just don't see that \"smart investment\" anywhere. In the meantime I'd suggest keeping your distance from the pricey GW Pharmaceuticals and instead monitor it from the sidelines."}

Many chanted slogans such as \u201cGod is Great\u201d or used derogatory terms like \u201cyou Christian dogs\u201d as they launched their attacks.\nHistorical and religious relics were desecrated. Graffiti left scrawled upon walls in the aftermath of the attacks included slogans such as \u201cMorsi is my President\u201d and \u201cThey killed our brothers during prayer\u201d.\nThe messages leave little doubt as to the sectarian nature of the attacks and link the events firmly to the crackdown against Morsi supporters in Cairo. Attacks were frequently preceded by incitement from local mosques and religious leaders.\nIn Al-Minya, where most of the attacks occurred, a journalist, Zeinab Ismail, who witnessed scenes of violence, said attackers were armed with machetes and swords.\nSome residents were attacked in their homes.

All of these ideas are affordable and would make a huge difference to the lives of students, families and the overall community.\nGrowing up as a first-generation Canadian, my biggest challenge was balancing and navigating two competing cultural realities.

This is a remarkable achievement which predicts a bright future for the country and its people \u2013 but, at the same time, it is by no means a time to lean back and rest. The level of development needs to be sustained in the coming years for graduation to happen.\nThe LDC graduation criteria are linked to a significant obstacle to Lao PDR\u2019s development: unexploded ordnance (UXO). Many of the bombs that were dropped on Lao PDR decades ago still lie in the ground, active and treacherous.\nThe majority of Lao PDR\u2019s communities rely on agriculture for a living. But in areas where UXO contamination is prevalent, fear rules the fields, hindering farmers to grow food for their families, unable to escape the poverty trap.\nUXO has a direct impact on the economy of the country, as contaminated land could otherwise be used for the development of industry, tourism and the construction of infrastructure. Victims of UXO accidents are facing serious obstacles to access the labour market as there is no network of special programs to allow them to contribute to the GDP. Transporting goods and services in contaminated areas adds to the challenge.\nChildren \u2013 the most valuable asset Lao PDR has for the future \u2013 are at risk, playing in areas not yet cleared or foraging in the forest. Children disabled by UXO drop out of school because of lacking infrastructure, emotional stress and not least, social stigma. Schools and roads cannot be built because of the bombs hindering construction.\nLooking for solutions and innovative approaches to solve the UXO problem is a continued effort in the country: The Government set up UXO Lao, the national clearance operator in 1996, and established the coordinating body for the UXO sector, the National Regulatory Authority for UXO and Mine Action (NRA) in 2006. The technical skills of both organizations have increased significantly over the past years.\nPositive changes were seen in recent years thanks to the evidence-based survey approach now used by all operators to clear the land, which increased the amount of UXO found per hectare of land by more than four times, and allowed clearance to happen much faster. The surveys have resulted in more than 60,000 hectares of confirmed hazardous areas identified since 2015.\nThe number of UXO casualties has been reduced by 85 per cent over the last decade. In recent years, less than 50 casualties have been reported annually, below the national target of less than 75 casualties a year.

Is he right?\nWhen Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) introduced streaming just over a decade ago, it would have been difficult to predict the resulting changes in the media landscape. The company still dominates the industry it pioneered, but a number of well-heeled competitors have made moves to stake a claim in this new paradigm.\nAmazon is the company's largest competitor in the streaming video space, though it still falls a distant second. Alphabet's YouTube has taken a different path, offering a mix of music and video selections. Apple has also thrown its hat in the ring, adding programs to its Apple Music service, with plans to ramp that up in the coming year, reportedly planning to spend $1 billion on content. Even Facebook is getting into the game with the Watch feature, introduced last year.\nOne company notably absent from this Who's Who of tech giants is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), leading one analyst to predict that the company will make a bid to acquire Netflix in a bold move to enter the burgeoning streaming segment.\nAnalysts love to wonder about the next megadeal, and Netflix has frequently been the target of such speculation. In the most recent round of conjecture about massive tie-ups, Porter Bibb, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners said of the streaming video space, \"Things are moving faster than anyone would have ever imagined.\"\nBibb has 40 years' experience working in media and entertainment, so he knows a thing or two about the industry. He posited that Microsoft would like to be a contender in streaming video but currently lacks the necessary media content. He believes those shortcomings will result in a merger between the two companies -- a marriage that will be announced at some point in the next two years.\n\"They don't have any direct to the consumer content delivery,\" Bibb told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think Netflix is going to be acquired by Microsoft, which doesn't have any content right now.\"\nBibb thinks Microsoft is currently laser-focused on its Azure cloud-computing segment, and those efforts have resulted in the company being one of the largest players in the industry, second only to Amazon -- which pioneered the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service business. It has, however, distracted Microsoft from the massive adoption of online viewing.\nIt's important to note that there's ample precedent for Microsoft using its massive war chest to acquire technology it desires -- like artificial intelligence -- or spend to fill a hole in its corporate strategy. The company has made hundreds of such deals over the years, but the two most high-profile acquisitions are likely internet phone service Skype and business social network LinkedIn.\nWhile there's certainly potential for this type of deal to come to fruition, the biggest obstacle would likely be the price tag. Netflix recently became the world's most valuable media company, with a market cap of over $152 billion. Add to that the significant premium that shareholders would almost certainly require to approve any buyout, and the price tag quickly exceeds $200 billion -- and that's if Netflix was inclined to be acquired at all.\nI suspect that the cost alone will be enough to dissuade Microsoft from such a purchase. Anything's possible, but I think it's highly unlikely."}

The extra weight from the cover caused the rocket to dive back to Earth, splashing into the ocean near Antarctica, where a group of environment ministers from more than a dozen countries met Monday to get the latest science on global climate.\nThe 986-pound satellite was supposed to be placed into a polar orbit about 400 miles high. The project was nine years in the making, and the mission was supposed to last two years.\nCarbon dioxide is transparent to the ultraviolet radiation that the Earth receives from the sun but is opaque to the infrared rays that Earth radiates back, which means that the gas effectively \u201ctraps\u201d heat like a greenhouse does. Higher levels could warm up the planet in dangerous ways.\nScientists now depend on 282 land-based stations - and scattered instrumented aircraft flights - to monitor carbon dioxide at low altitudes.\nEngineers will look at existing spacecraft parts to see whether it makes sense to build another carbon observatory, said Mike Freilich, earth science division director at NASA headquarters.\nGraeme Stephens, another member of the Colorado State team, said researchers will ask NASA to try again.\nA team of experts will investigate the loss of the satellite. It\u2019s the first failure of a launch with a Taurus rocket since 2001. That year, a NASA ozone-monitoring satellite and a cargo of human ashes aboard a Taurus rocket fell into the Indian Ocean after veering off course during launch.\nTuesday\u2019s failure put on hold the summer launch of another NASA satellite, Glory, which will measure soot and aerosols in the atmosphere, said launch manager Charles Dovale."}

Bianca Lara has taken a brand-new carpenter\u2019s saw from a display, propped the handle against her leg, and is gently bending the blade into a lazy curve. She makes a fist and raps up and down the spine of the blade with a knuckle, producing wobbly sci-fi sounds that draw a small crowd. \u201cThat saw must be made outta some kind of good steel,\u201d says a bystander.\n\u201cI\u2019m on a mission to become San Diego\u2019s finest musical sawist.\u201d It is a word of Bianca Lara\u2019s making, sawist. A petite 30-ish singer in the Gypsy-jazz tradition based in Oceanside, Lara performs at the Mediterranean Caf\u00e9 in Carlsbad on Friday nights. \u201cGuitarist, pianist, why not sawist?\u201d But the playing of a musical saw is not a perfect art, and it takes a good deal of time before one is able to achieve pitch. Lara\u2019s been practicing three hours a night since spring, she says.\nIt is not known who was the first to unlock the music within a carpenter\u2019s saw by applying a fiddle bow to it, but academics believe it happened sometime during the 19th Century in the rural Appalachian Mountains. Others claim the musical saw came from Russia, or even South America. Lara\u2019s vision was to play saw in her Gypsy-jazz band in place of a violin, but that ended when she learned of the musical saw\u2019s slow reflexes.\nThe first time she sawed at a public gig, she accidentally cut through her fishnet stockings. Less dangerous, perhaps, are the saws made specifically for music. They have no teeth. They date back to 1919 when a Wisconsin enthusiast named Clarence Mussehl began manufacturing toothless musical saws capable of rendering as many as 20 notes. During his best year in business, Mussehl sold 25,000 of them. Musical saws are made with thinner steel that is easier to bend, says Lara, and bending is what makes the notes. \u201cBasically, what happens is you\u2019re trying to make an S curve with the saw blade so the saw can sing.\u201d She demonstrates.

The GNU OS, however, still needed a kernel. It was provided, perhaps advertently, by a Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds who in 1991 began working on his own free version of Unix for personal computers, which was named Linux.\nToday, of course, Linux is one of the most widely used, if not the most widely used, OSes on the globe. Technically speaking, Torvalds\u2019 contribution to Linux is mostly the kernel, or the operating core, of what we think of as Linux. Many of the supporting components in today\u2019s Linux distributions actually come from the GNU project.\nStallman campaigned for a few years to rename Linux as the GNU/Linux, which, although technically being a more accurate name, failed to catch on, even as Linux development and usage continued to accelerate.\nIn its latest annual survey of Linux development, the Linux Foundation estimated that since 2005, nearly 10,000 individual developers from over 1,000 different companies contributed to the Linux kernel.\nThis practice incensed Stallman, and he vowed to fight it with his new OS.\nIn order to support the development of GNU, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation in 1985, where he remains to this day as its unpaid president.\nFSF went on to champion the use of free software and warn people about the dangers of being trapped by proprietary software and systems.\nEver the staunch idealist and stickler for precise definitions, Stallman has never adopted the term \u201copen source\u201d for describing free software, pointing out that \u201cfree\u201d in the context of free software has always referred more than to how much it costs to purchase the software.\n\u201dWhen we call software \u2018free,\u2019 we mean that it respects the users\u2019 essential freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.

Although tile can be installed in mastic or on top of plywood with specialty thinset in dry areas, with showers there is the continual presence of moisture, which the concrete board will help absorb over time rather than allowing to penetrate the wood of the wall studs and eventually rot out the home. It's installed with a moisture barrier to provide a moisture-resistant layer for the wall tile.\nDecide the best way to install the board on your shower walls. Vertical or horizontal placement doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s all about the ease of installation. If you have a wide enough shower and placing the sheets on their longest edge works best, do that. Otherwise, run the sheets with their length going up and down.\nCover the wall studs in plastic sheeting cut down to size with a utility knife to act as a moisture barrier for the wall studs behind the backer board. Staple the sheeting up into place and layer them with a waterfall method so that each upper piece drains down onto the next lower sheet, working their way down to the shower pan. Ensure that the lowest edge of the sheeting covers the shower pan flange.\nSplit any two pieces of board that need to share a wall stud across the width of the stud. Each piece needs to be able to mount to the wall stud, so they will have to share the piece. If a piece extends beyond a stud, you will have to cut it down to the last stud it crosses and then cut another piece down to fit to share the opposite side of the stud.\nMeasure and mark your pieces. Make straight cuts with the utility knife. Hold the T-square against the sheet, guide your utility blade down the length of the cut and then snap the piece along this scored surface line. This will break the piece along that line. Fold the piece from there and cut the back side of the cut with the utility knife to free the cut-off.\nMake cuts around any pipe stub-outs, such as shower heads and faucets, with a keyhole saw. This works the same way for drywall. Push the tip of the keyhole saw into the backerboard and then saw your way around the cut-out with in-and-out motions of your hand on the handle.\nStack the pieces up the wall, starting with the lowest piece first to let gravity help you. If working alone, place a couple of screws slightly into the wall roughly 1/8 inch above the shower pan so that you can rest the first sheet on top of those screws while you screw the first sheet in place. Future pieces can rest on the top edge of the lower piece.\nMount each piece to the wall studs. Drill through the board into the studs. Place screws every 6 inches or so up the wall studs, and within 1/2 inch from any edges. Leave at least a 1/8-inch gap between all pieces to allow for expansion movement.\nCaulk the gaps between pieces with silicone caulk, as well as the gap from the lowest piece on top of the shower pan.

Energy Department loans or loan guarantees given to now bankrupt companies like solar panel makers Solyndra and Abound Solar along with troubled electric auto maker Fisker or battery producer EnerOne raise serious questions about those federal funding programs. The latest program under new investigation from Congress is the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) from which producers generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs).\nRFS, RINs? What? A similar false market system for carbon tax credit trading already exists in Europe and there are similar proposals here. If those proposals become law, a new batch of acronyms defining a fake market with real dollars attached will be born. RFS\u2019s and RINs are hard enough to grasp for now.\nUnder the RFS program, the government requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. When a producer makes renewable fuel like ethanol or biodiesel, the producer is required to generate a renewable identification number or RIN to match the quantity of fuel produced. Petroleum fuel producers are required to buy RINs from renewable fuel suppliers to earn credits to meet the renewable fuel rules. RINs are often traded between companies to help achieve compliance in renewable fuel percentages. However, because of the lack of oversight, there are currently hundreds of millions o fraudulent RINs in circulation.\nLast month, Cargill announced it was suing the brokerage firm International Exchange Services (IES) over breach of contract allegations involving a deal for alleged fraudulent biodiesel RINs. Also, in June 2011, Rodney Hailey of Maryland, who led Clean Green Fuel LLC, made $9.1 million generating and selling RINs without producing any quantity of biodiesel. Since then, he\u2019s been convicted of fraud and awaits sentencing. Similar fraud cases have been reported in Texas and Alabama. Obviously, the problem is widespread.\nIn fact, the number of biodiesel RINs that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has publicly announced as invalid has increased from about 80 million to over 140 million \u2013 5 to 12% of the current biodiesel RIN market. Experts speculate that the number of fraudulent RIN\u2019s could be double before the end of this year. Unfortunately, EPA\u2019s efforts to reduce fraud seem ineffective.\nSadly, under current law, companies that purchased illegal RINs are prosecuted regardless of whether they knew the RINs they bought were valid or not. Those companies are subject to EPA fines and penalties and must replace the fraudulent RINs with valid ones. Consequently, legitimate producers, refiners, and traders inadvertently caught in this illicit activity have lost hundreds of millions of dollars \u2013 a huge problem for all concerned.\nWith pressure on Congress to address the problem and several bills already proposed, the EPA has signaled revisions need to be made to the program to reduce fraud.\nAs legislation is introduced and solutions debated, a closer look at the potential for deception and fraud in the existing RIN program is critical. Moreover, further examination by all industries impacted by the program will lead to a better executed policy and greater progress toward America energy stability.\nTrue American independence from foreign energy resources looms and Colorado will be part of that success. But the RFS and RIN program must be more closely monitored and free of rampant fraud. One thing is certain; eliminating fraud in the RIN program will be very instructive in developing future"}

As the latest film, Star Trek Beyond, makes its way into theaters, the franchise as a whole is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The impassioned following the property has acquired over the past five decades is regularly cited as a main reason why Trek has endured in pop culture for so long, and Paramount and CBS are making sure that all those who have stuck with the brand through thick and thin are appreciated in 2016. The special fan event held this past May was only the beginning of their plans.\nThe world premiere of Beyond will take place during a first-of-its-kind outdoor IMAX screening during San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where hundreds of lucky fans will be able to see the movie early. But with such a monumental milestone to commemorate, Star Trek's presence at SDCC will go (ahem) beyond the film's debut. The Final Frontier will be taking over the famous Hall H for a panel to reflect upon its legacy.\nAccording to TV Line, Bryan Fuller will moderate Star Trek: Celebrating 50 Years on Saturday, July 23 from 2 - 3 p.m. The Q&A session will feature Trek actors William Shatner, Scott Bakula, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, and Jeri Ryan. Details on what to expect are scarce, but no doubt it will involve everyone looking back on their time with the various incarnations of Star Trek and the impact it had on their lives and careers.\nThat Fuller is involved is big news for Trekkers. He is serving as executive producer of an all-new Star Trek television series that will debut on CBS (and stream on CBS All-Access) in 2017. Fuller has briefly discussed his ideas for the show and casting, but indicated that more specifics would be made available around SDCC. It would appear that CBS is saving some major reveals for this particular panel, allowing fans to get excited about the future while also reminiscing about the past. It wouldn't be out of the question to expect announcements about the cast and possibly new character names. The series is aiming to start production in September, so these pieces have to come together soon.\nIt will be interesting to see how the latest Trek series shapes up. Fuller has mentioned he intends to honor the spirit of its predecessors - a sentiment echoed by the makers of Star Trek Beyond. There are those who feel that the property is better served on the small screen and are looking forward to fresh adventures with a brand new crew. Fuller has had success in the past, particularly on NBC's Hannibal, so he's a proven show runner capable of delivering a high-quality product. If the movies of the Kelvin Timeline are on thin ice with the fan base, this project could be Star Trek's ticket to continued prosperity.\nIn the meantime, fans will have plenty to look forward to a couple of weeks from now (as of this writing) when famous faces of Star Trek gather for what is sure to be an unforgettable panel. With so many eras of the franchise represented, there's bound to be a plethora of fun and entertaining stories as people come together to celebrate one of the longest running touchstones in popular culture."}

{"idx": "31136", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: And it was night. Wednesday in Holy Week marks an inflection point between light and dark: halfway from dusk to dawn, midway between two resurrections. Yes, two resurrections: because you cannot understand Jesus\u2019 resurrection in the Gospel of John without first knowing about Lazarus\u2019 resurrection. Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead is the catalyst that sets everything in motion this Holy Week.\nAnd Lazarus is the mirror opposite of Judas. As Lazarus is raised from the dead and brought into the light, Judas descends further into darkness with every step, unable or unwilling to open his eyes and live in the light and truth of God\u2019s love. Tonight, we consider Lazarus versus Judas, the light versus the night. And we wait in this darkness, in this night, for the light to come. If it does \u2014 when it does \u2014 how will we react? Will we walk into the light or turn away?\nTo know how we got here, we have to know where we\u2019ve been. It was only a few weeks before this night that Jesus had been called to Bethany by Mary and Martha. Their brother Lazarus was ill. He may have had leprosy \u2014 Bethany was built to house a colony of lepers. The village of Bethany was just outside of Jerusalem, just out of sight of the temple, in fact. The name Bethany translates to something like \u201cthe house of affliction.\u201d It was where the city of Jerusalem sent people who were poor or sick. Bethany was built out of sight of the temple so those coming into the city to worship wouldn\u2019t have to see all that ugliness, that poverty and desperation.\nThe meaning of Easter isn\u2019t contained in just one resurrection. In John\u2019s Gospel, the struggle between light and dark \u2014 what we are living through during this Holy Week \u2014 is framed by two resurrections: first Lazarus, then Jesus. Jesus\u2019 raising of Lazarus is the catalyst that sets in motion everything that happens in Holy Week. News of the miracle spreads and brings Jesus many new followers \u2014 and it\u2019s these new converts who all turn out with palm branches to honor Jesus as he enters Jerusalem at the beginning of Passover week. These crowds bring Jesus to the attention of the temple authorities, and eventually the Roman governor.\nThe night before that Palm Sunday demonstration, the newly raised Lazarus hosted a gathering for Jesus in Bethany. Although Jesus raising Lazarus was astounding, the idea of resurrection was not entirely unheard of. In fact, Martha is exasperated with Jesus when he first tells her that Lazarus will rise again\u2014 \u201cI know, I know,\u201d she says, \u201cat the last day,\u201d as if to say, \u201cof course he will live again \u2014 we all will.\u201d For John, the point of Jesus\u2019 resurrection is not to impress on us how utterly unique Jesus is. John has other ways of making that point. In John\u2019s Gospel, the meaning of Jesus\u2019 resurrection is wrapped up with Lazarus\u2019: the point is that resurrection life starts now, and is meant for everybody.\nJohn\u2019s other point is that resurrection always means the resurrection of the body. Bodies matter in the Gospel of John. When Jesus is standing outside Lazarus\u2019 tomb, Martha and Mary are careful to warn him that the corpse is four days old, so of course, there will be a stench. And at the gathering on the night before Palm Sunday, Mary anoints Jesus\u2019 feet with a pound of costly perfume, and then wipes his feet with her hair: you can\u2019t get more embodied than that.

The project celebrates an autonomous way of producing goods, using bio-materials. It is a fresh take on crafts and design, tradition and the uncomplicated in everyday life. This show definitely stands in contrast to most of the other stuff we see at the Salone in Milan this week.Autarchy makes us reflect about everyday tools we use and invites us to grow and make them ourselves. The designers suggest an alternative way of making things, a bit like back in the old days, where knowledge is passed on to find accessible and sustainable solutions.\nAutarchy outlines a hypothetical scenario where a community is embracing a serene and self inflicted embargo where nature is personally cultivated, harvested and processed, to feed and make tools to serve human necessities.\nThe installation shows beautifully-shaped objects in earthly colours: brooms, vessels and lamps in different colours obtained by natural ingredients such as vegetables, spices and roots that are dried, boiled or filtered for their natural dyes. In a clever and precise way, eggs are used as paint to add detail on the dry surface of the bowls. The bowls and lamps are made of 70% flour, 20% agricultural waste, and 10% natural limestone, and are naturally desiccated or baked at low temperature. The result: minimum embodied energy and fully renewable and biodegradable products.\nWe could not refrain from marveling at the beautiful craftsmanship and design that has gone into making the straw-brooms, from the cereal sorghum. For this project, Studio Formafantasma invited the Italian broom maker Giuseppe Brunello and the renowned French bakery Poilane to participate. What better than a cereal can connect these people and result in a perfect production process without generating any waste.\nWe like the open-sourceness of this project.

It was an odd way to describe a dictator who leads one of the most brutal and secretive regimes on earth -- a man whose nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, according to Trump and his advisers, pose a grave and unacceptable threat to the United States and its allies.\nTrump announced later Thursday that he and Kim the Excellent (formerly known as Rocket Man) will hold their much-anticipated summit on June 12 in Singapore. I remain skeptical that Kim will ever give up his hard-won nukes and missiles, even for an ironclad U.S. promise never to attack or seek regime change, which is what Kim says he wants. I believe Kim looks at Trump and sees unprecedented opportunity.\nKim is finally getting one thing that North Korean leaders have always sought -- one-on-one negotiation with a U.S. president as equals. I believe Trump was right to agree to a summit, since the policy of not talking hasn\u2019t worked. But a lot more groundwork should have been laid, and I fear Trump will return with a bright, shiny package full of promises that turn out to be empty.\nI understand why Kim would want to get out from under international sanctions and offer his oppressed people enough economic growth to make his own position more secure. I also understand why he might want to signal officials in neighboring China that if they are not more forthcoming with money, technology and other goodies, North Korea has another suitor knocking at the door.\nBut there\u2019s no reason to prejudge the summit\u2019s outcome when we don\u2019t even really know the agenda. Kim has already declared a pause in his provocative nuclear and missile testing. Maybe he and Trump will emerge with a pact to reach a more substantive agreement at a later date. That would be a good thing -- while we\u2019re talking, we\u2019re not shooting -- and Trump would have achieved something worthwhile.\nThat credit is negated, however, by Trump\u2019s unjustifiable and reckless decision to renounce the Iran nuclear deal. Of all the bad decisions Trump has made as president, this is the most dangerous. He seems to be trying to start an unthinkable war.\nOfficials in Germany, France and Britain have pledged to try to keep the agreement alive. But with the Trump administration already threatening to sanction European firms that continue to do business with Iran, it is unclear if the deal can survive without the world\u2019s leading economic power and most important reserve currency.\nIt is customary to insert the caveat that the Iran agreement isn\u2019t perfect, that it has obvious flaws, that it could be much better, and so on. But actually it is, or was, quite good. It has provided an unprecedented window into every nook and cranny of the Iranian nuclear program; divested Iran of its stocks of highly enriched uranium that can be easily made into fuel for bombs; and halted Iran\u2019s steady progress toward nuclear weapons for at least a decade.\nPut yourself, for a moment, in the Iranian regime\u2019s position. You know that the full economic benefits of the deal will never come through. You see the U.S. administration aggressively promoting your rival, Saudi Arabia, as a dominant regional power that is bristling with advanced new weapons and backed by other Sunni states.

For whoever gets their hands on the famous three-handled trophy at Hampden tomorrow, the outcome of a highly-anticipated League Cup final will carry considerable resonance throughout the rest of the campaign and beyond.\nBrendan Rodgers may seek to play down the personal significance of victory on a day when Celtic are bidding to win the 100th major honour of their storied existence, but there can be no doubt this is a telling moment in his own managerial career.\nHis Aberdeen counterpart Derek McInnes has made no secret of his ambition to oversee what he describes as the creation of an era of success at the Pittodrie club in which their first trophy during his tenure, the League Cup win of three seasons ago, is added to on a consistent basis.\nHaving established Aberdeen as Celtic\u2019s closest challengers during Rangers\u2019 troubles of the past few years, it feels appropriate that it is McInnes who stands between Rodgers and what the bookmakers firmly expect will be the first major honour to be appended to the Northern Irishman\u2019s CV.\nIt is the first time in six seasons that the leading two sides from the top flight of Scottish football have gone head-to-head in the League Cup final, since the last time the Old Firm contested it back in 2010-11, and there is a sense there is a greater prize at stake for both managers than just the trophy itself.\nRodgers could scarcely have enjoyed a more impressive start to life at Celtic this season, completing his primary objective of taking the club back into the group stage of the Champions League while at the same time exerting an early domestic dominance which sees them ten points clear of the Dons at the top of the Premiership after just 12 games.\nA 2-2 draw at Inverness in September is the only slight blemish on an unbeaten record against Scottish opponents so far for Rodgers, including two league victories already over Aberdeen. He believes another win tomorrow would be fitting recognition of Celtic\u2019s form so far but is also wary of the inevitability their run must come to an end one day.\n\u201cIt would be nice for the players to get that trophy and it would be a good reward to the start they have had this season,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been the best team so far. But you have to earn it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to earn every victory we\u2019ve had along the way. Everything points to a good, tough game. The two games we\u2019ve had against Aberdeen have been tough but if we play the way we have been since the start of the season, then we will have a good chance.\n\u201cWe will lose games, there is no question about it. It will happen at some point. But it\u2019s not in our thinking. We worry about playing good football, attacking football, being really aggressive in our defending.\n\u201cWhat has been nice in this early part of the season is that we have seen improvement in the structure and thinking of the team. They are not just running, or having to run. They are thinking about the things they are doing.

They are after the minimum \u20ac300,000 residential units and by tradition they direct their interest towards Paphos. Having said this, Chinese companies have shown an interest in large scale investments and developments. In Larnaca two hotels are under development by a joint venture with Chinese investors, whereas another five-star hotel is under way in Sotira with Chinese involvement.\nThese developments by themselves are encouraging for the building industry, but long term though, hopefully the introduction of the Chinese market will project Cyprus to China to attract tourists. The island\u2019s \u201cclean air\u201d is one of the major reasons for the Chinese to look for property investments, while the security and locals\u2019 hospitality also play an important role for this market.\nThere are no clear indications on the number of units bought by Chinese in recent years (estimated to be around 500 units with a value of \u20ac1.5bil) but we expect market demand is anticipated to increase as the small Chinese community becomes more involved in local activities and become themselves promoters for our real estate and tourism. To this end the much awaited direct flights between Cyprus and China by Cobalt Airways will help.\nWhy the Chinese with such a diversity in their own country wish to visit and even reside in Cyprus is difficult to pinpoint. A Chinese client informed us that \u201cwe feel at home, people welcome us as part of the family, the limited crime and no racism, as well as the established community in Paphos, are some of the attractions\u201d.\nWhat one must be careful with is the Chinese visa agents who also operate as estate agents, supported regrettably by various local advocates. The average commission required by these agents is 20% on the sales price, a large amount, but it seems that so far they are getting away with it. Such high commissions are not illegal, but are they honest?\nOn one occasion a Chinese buyer bought an apartment in Larnaca for \u20ac300,000 with ordinary 5% commission included while a neighbor bought similar apartment for \u20ac230,000. They got together and the scam was realised and we hear that the case will lead to court.\nThis reminds us of the early years of the British market demand with such scams which for various reasons lead to the creation of the Property Action Group with all sorts of bad publicity. We hope that this experience will not be repeated in the future, but it is doubtful and we consider it inevitable. Increasing greed is a sickness in all countries and individuals but it seems Cyprus is a champion. We would have expected that the advocates who are supposed to advise the Chinese buyers accordingly and carry out a due diligence, would have advised the buyer, but, alas. No wonder in a recent property exhibition in China, some Chinese (presumably buyers) appear with placards objecting to Cyprus etc.\n\u201cWe were approached by a visa agent to buy a real estate in Cyprus during an exhibition. There were in addition to Cyprus, other countries offering free inspection trips but we opted for Cyprus, where we had to pay for the trip, but not the accommodation.\n\u201cFor the three-day visit our programme was so full including lunches/dinners there was no chance to look around the wider area.\n\u201cWe ended up on the third day to sign a sales contract at an advocate\u2019s office where we taken by the developer, and the advocate added his own good comments on the purchase.\n\u201cAfter 3 months when we stayed at the"}

But many are in limbo, separated from family, the result of stricter religious law.\nJewish worshippers gather at a makeshift synagogue established by the Jewish Agency for Israel for Ethiopian Jews in Gondar, Ethiopia, in 2012.\nIn the half darkness of an adobe hut in Gondar, Ethiopia, 20-year-old Gezahegn (\"Gezi\") Derebe pulls out an acoustic guitar. As on many evenings when the power goes out, he entertains his family by singing. Though his mother, Ayelesh, sways to the tune, she doesn't understand the lyrics, because Gezi sings not in his native Amharic, but in Hebrew.\nBehind him, on a wall kept cool with a traditional mixture of cow dung and ash, hangs a laminated map of Israel. Above it are the framed photographs of his relatives who have already managed to emigrate there.\nGezi would like to join them.\nFor years, it seemed like only a matter of time. In 2003, when Gezi was 8 years old, his family sold its land and livestock and moved to Gondar, a hub for the Ethiopian Jewish community. Gezi enrolled in a school run by the Jewish Agency for Israel and staffed by Israeli volunteer teachers, with a curriculum designed to prepare young emigrants for their future life.\nGezahegn Derebe, 20, left his village to come to Gondar, Ethiopia, the hub for Ethiopia's Jewish community, where he prepared for a new life in Israel. Now, more than a decade later, he remains in Gondar, while other members of his family have managed to emigrate.\nGezi learned Hebrew, and Israeli history, and Jewish studies. His former teacher, Naama Avitsur, told me that Gezi was not only the brightest Hebrew student in the class but also the most grateful. He was \"so thankful for everything,\" Avitsur says. \"He really cares about his Judaism.\"\nGezi's Jewish education, unique in a country known for anti-Semitism, strengthened his sense of his own identity and his belief that one day he would live in Israel.\nBut the same organization that had granted him this education then informed him he would not qualify to go Israel, because he wasn't Jewish enough. The reason? One of his ancestors, on the maternal side, was Christian. According to traditional Jewish law, he's not technically Jewish.\nBut Gezi has reason to think that what's holding him back is not centuries-old rabbinical law but rather the more mercurial dictates of politics. If it were merely a question of biology, why would one side of the family have been allowed and the other not?\nMore than 1,000 miles away in a high-rise apartment outside Tel Aviv, the walls hung with school running medals, Gezi's uncle, Tachelo, and his cousin Habtu sit on a couch and explain that they got lucky.\n\"The first immigrations were easier,\" Habtu says. \"Whoever wanted to come, came.

This neat little quadcopter folds down into a small rectangle that easily slides into a pocket. With the companion controller, which is similarly sized, you can deploy your drone anywhere the urge grabs you, and capture video at the same time.\nThe Pocket Drone is a Transformer at heart. When you're traveling, it's a simple, black box. When you want to fly, you fold the arms out, then twist the motors to lock them into their upright position. Two bright LEDs on the front (white) and back (green) help you orient the craft in flight; the lights mirror the coloring of the rotors.\nCredit: Richard Baguley/Tom's GuideIt is very simply built, obviously made from two plastic panels that snap together to form the case. I say obvious because there is a big gap between them that shows the interior: When the motor arms are in the flying position, you can see the wiring and electronics inside. While this no doubt keeps the weight down, it also gives the Pocket Drone a curiously unfinished feel.\nCredit: Richard Baguley/Tom's GuideThat impression of flimsiness isn't helped by a cover over the battery compartment that was very loose on the unit we reviewed. To charge the battery, you have to remove this cover, lift out the battery, disconnect the cable that connects it to the drone and connect the battery directly to the USB charger cable. This process is more complex than what you'll find on most other drones, in which the charger cables just plug directly into the drones. Plus, the microSD card slot is poorly designed, making removal of the card awkward.\n\"The Pocket Drone is a Transformer at heart.\"\nUnfortunately, during our testing, the rotor blades fit poorly. Each one is held onto the motor shaft by friction only, which means that the blades pop off very easily. This happened most of the time when we crashed. The rotor blade hit the ground first, popped off and flew away, often ending up 10 feet or more away from the quadcopter itself.\nCredit: Richard Baguley/Tom's GuideOne of the spare rotors that Odyssey Toys supplied with our review unit fit poorly onto the motor shaft, and it sometimes flew off midflight, sending the drone crashing. These crashes generally did not damage the rotors, but it was still annoying to have to hunt the parts down after each incident. It was especially distressing when my dog developed a taste for them, grabbing them and running off to chew on them later.\nThe controller is the same size as the Pocket Drone, and shares the same dimensions (7.5 x 7 x 1.1 inches). To make it more portable, the control sticks can be removed and stored under a panel next to the battery compartment. It's a bit more awkward to hold compared to other small drone controllers: The long shape and small control sticks make it less comfortable to hold than small controllers like the one paired with the Axis Vidius.\nCredit: Richard Baguley/Tom's GuideFour AAA batteries (not included) power the controller, and a simple switch in the middle turns the drone on and off.

Morin declined to comment on what he called speculation about Apple's purchase of his company.\nNow, Apple could always choose to buy Path just to acquire its staff. Apple could also change its mind, or Cook could be telling a slight fib. But all that seems unlikely.\nApple does have a history with social networking. In 2010 it announced Ping, a music-based social network tied to iTunes. The network's launch, alongside new iPods and a new Apple TV, had big-name music stars including Lady Gaga and Chris Martin. Apple shuttered the service two years later.\nSince then, Apple has created deep ties with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo, allowing users to connect the respective networks to their phones and computers to easily upload photos and update their profiles.\nApple also built iMessage, a text, photo and video messaging service, to help users more easily send missives to each other. Even its new Apple Watch has social-networking functions to send a friend anything from a scribble to a heartbeat.\nBut what Apple won't be doing, Cook says, is competing directly with Facebook or Twitter.\n\"We're not in the social-networking business,\" Cook said in his interview, adding that he considers the two services to be partners rather than competitors. \"We like both companies.\"\nAn Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about Cook's comments."}

{"idx": "31157", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The TV and movie industry has already begun moving en masse to the cloud with companies like Netflix leading the way. Video games are a little behind the curve, but the same trend is getting started. Some recent moves by cloud computing companies could be hinting that more change is on the way.\nCloud-based video games work in a similar fashion as TV streaming technology. The idea is that most or all of the computing necessary to render a game is done in a data center, and the video game is streamed via a high-speed internet connection back to the player on a TV, computer, or other supported device.\nThe benefit of cloud gaming is that it can eliminate the need for expensive hardware and the purchase of physical games. In the near future, all that will be needed is a monitor of some sort, like a TV or smartphone. Cloud gaming also makes the social aspect of video games easier, like online multiplayer events, spectating, and video and picture sharing. The benefit to gaming companies is more consistent revenue from subscription fees -- rather than game and console sales -- and the ability to dispense with expensive physical game distribution.\nHowever, unlike TV and movie streaming, cloud gaming is a little more complicated as it requires the processing of inputs. In the case of online multiplayer games, the server on which the game is hosted needs to process the inputs from dozens of users and stream the video results back to all players. That makes it nearly impossible for customers in areas without broadband internet to play. That infrastructure barrier is quickly shrinking, though, and technology has advanced to the point that the other necessary capabilities for cloud gaming are now a reality.\nThe potential elimination of gaming hardware could eventually spell doom for Sony&apos;s (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft&apos;s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox console platforms. That&apos;s why recent acquisitions and reorganizations are important for the two console makers. Microsoft purchased cloud gaming platform PlayFab early in 2018, and Sony reorganized its cloud computing assets into a new business division to help streamline operations and encourage growth. Both are hinting at the cloud being the future.\nFor now, most gamers still need hardware to play. The continued advancement of cloud technology could eventually change that, though. Microsoft and Sony are likely working to develop their own cloud gaming services because of threats from the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), both of which have been trying to woo gaming developers to their video game hosting and development services. Amazon made its own cloud gaming acquisition earlier this year to bolster its efforts when it purchased small cloud-gaming company GameSparks.\nWhich company will win this battle? While Microsoft and Sony have the most to lose because of Playstation and Xbox, its possible just about every company wins. According to the Entertainment Software Association, the video game industry grew 18% in 2017 to $36 billion. Cloud computing has the potential to make the gaming industry even bigger. Eliminating expensive hardware and increasing the social aspects of video games could open up new demographics, and the expansion of high speed internet abroad could bring new customers into the fold as well.\nFor investors looking to take advantage of the trend, cloud computing companies like Amazon and Google are a good place to start. Game developers like Electronic Arts will also benefit from potentially more stable subscription fees and lower distribution costs when selling games.\nWhichever route you choose, bear in mind that yesterday&apos;s winners aren&apos;t guaranteed to win again. Look at what Netflix, for example, has done to television with cloud-based video. Cloud gaming could be"}

It\u2019s unique, strange, \u201cdifficult,\u201d endlessly playful, important, influential, conceptual, frustrating, enjoyable, and one of the most devoted love stories ever written. To build up to the March 11th event for Macedonio (\u201cThe Greatest Event Since It and the World Began\u201d), which will take place at the Americas Society and feature Edith Grossman, Margaret Schwartz, and Todd Garth, all this week we\u2019re going to be serializing Margaret\u2019s translator\u2019s introduction.

Enjoy!\nThe Museum of Eterna\u2019s Novel is written for what the author calls the \u201cskip-around reader.\u201d In an often hilarious but equally maddening series of between fifty-seven and sixty prologues\u2014depending on whether you count the dedications, the post-prologue, and the blank page dedicated to the reader\u2019s indecision\u2014the novel postpones itself, thwarting both the reader who tries to skip ahead (where to?) and the dull \u201corderly\u201d reader\u2019s desire for linearity. There are prologues of salutation, prologues introducing the author and the characters, prologue-letters to the critics, prologues about characters who were rejected, a prologue of authorial despair and, of course, prologues about prologuing.\nThe novel takes place on an estancia, or country home, outside of Buenos Aires. The estancia is named \u201cLa Novela,\u201d and in it the characters share a domestic intimacy reflected in its prose. Much time is devoted to the small comings and goings of life at \u201cLa Novela,\u201d and the eventual abandonment of this placid domesticity in favor of the action of the novel\u2014the conquest of Buenos Aires in the name of beauty. Thus The Museum of Eterna\u2019s Novel is also an ardent structure, dedicated to the suspension of time, its enclosure both still and fluid. The eternity it captures is intimate, domestic: kitchen conversations and stovetop kettles, the sound of eucalyptus leaves blowing against the eaves on wet afternoons.\nThe Museum of Eterna\u2019s Novel asks a simple question: how can we give ourselves fully to love in the face of the certainty of death? And it proposes itself as an answer, however awkwardly and provisionally, by creating a space where neither life nor death exist, only non-being and oblivion. Where there is love, there is no death, only forgetfulness.\nAs difficult and visionary and ambitious as the structure is, this concern is very simple, human, and understandable. Love opens all of us up to the possibility of loss. What makes Macedonio\u2019s story remarkable is how earnestly he wrestles with tigers that we all face. It isn\u2019t the felicity of his prose, or the prescience of his ideas\u2014though his prose is often felicitous and his ideas often prescient.

The FDA's ODD program provides orphan status to drugs intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. It is estimated that there are approximately 15,000-20,000 Americans with ALS.\nALS is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells that control voluntary muscles throughout the body to produce movements including talking, eating, walking, and breathing. ALS is progressive, meaning it gets worse over time. As the nerves lose the ability to control muscles, the muscles become weak and eventually lead to paralysis. Most people with ALS succumb to respiratory failure, usually within three to five years from when symptoms first appear.\nThe Orphan Drug Designation submission included data from a 2017 double-blind placebo-controlled European pilot study in humans. To expand on the results of the pilot study, Elysium Health expects to initiate a placebo-controlled study in collaboration with Mayo Clinic to evaluate EH301 in up to 150 adults with ALS by the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAs the Vice Chair of Neurology at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Eric Sorenson specializes in neuromuscular medicine and the treatment of ALS. \"ALS is one of the most devastating conditions known today, it is generally swift and severe in its onset and progression with no effective treatment options,\" said Sorenson.\nElysium Health Chief Scientist Dr. Leonard Guarente added that \"There is a great deal of work to be done to address the need for continued research to better understand and to treat all neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that the FDA's granting of Orphan Drug Designation for EH301 for ALS underscores the need for novel treatments for this rare condition.\"\nThe granting of ODD to EH301 does not alter the standard regulatory requirement through adequate and well-controlled studies to support FDA approval, and there is no guarantee EH301 will be approved for the treatment of ALS by FDA.\nMayo Clinic has financial interest in Elysium Health. All revenue Mayo Clinic receives will be used to fund its not-for-profit mission in medical research and education.\nElysium Health's\u2122 mission is to solve the biggest challenges in health with science, to help people live healthier, longer.

{"idx": "31164", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Complete Gettysburg Guide is a new kind of guidebook. It doesn't set up a new paradigm for guidebooks, but rather adjusts each standard component to produce a large overall change. This makes it as different from ordinary guidebooks as an army staff ride is from, say, a battlefield tour.\nConsider a basic, conventional guide. There's a map, usually B&W, showing roads but little detail, with numbers that key to explanatory text. The idea behind the numbers drives the organization of the guide. The spots on the ordinary tour map can be there based on popularity; accessibility; efficiency of touring; and, very often, \"ownership\" (belonging to a park). The sequence of stops can be based on covering-the-most-ground-in-a-day; or \"must see\" criteria; or places being closest to the road; or richness of historical data for that spot. This builds a high degree of arbitrariness into most tour guides. Here, author J. David Petruzzi and his publisher address arbitrariness as a matter of \"completeness.\" The title, The Complete Gettysburg Guide, could as well have been The Rational Gettysburg Guide, or The Historian's Gettysburg Guide, chronology providing the motive organizing the \"spots\" in this work.\nThe work (which has its own website) follows the time sequence of days, beginning with opening cavalry clashes and finishing with follow-on battles. (It includes, at the end of the book, visits to cemeteries and rock carvings, which are obviously off the timeline.) The narrative is keyed, not to your day, or an allotted time you will spend in any one spot, but rather to the event, with events broken up intra-day (you might say into \"phases\"). Each of these phases gets its own beautiful map by Steven Stanley adorned with a clock. The map shows dispositions as they were on terrain as it was; the clock allows the visitor to align time of day to the tour; and the historic description of events allows visualization of events in place.\nI mentioned adjusting components. The maps are spectacular, as anyone who receives Stanley's maps in Civil War Preservation Trust mailings could expect. The minimum position for publisher Savas Beatie would have been to provide a route map; here we see many top-notch battle maps as a kind of bonus. The clock aspect is also important in maintaining fidelity to timeline ? the organizing principle for the whole tour.\nAnother adjustment: the battle narrative. These are not here compiled or recapped from same-old-same-old; J.D. Petruzzi has researched and written material that would otherwise stand alone in a splendidly written work based on new accounts and including fresh contemporary (and current) imagery. There is a great deal of good reading here, irrespective of touring.\nSo we have these vivid, and interesting battle descriptions ? good history - graced by fascinating maps and novel imagery inhabiting a guide book done completely in color, the \"guide\" part of which is also special.\nOn a mechanical level, the guidance, the driving instructions, is at a level of detail rarely seen, involving tenths of a mile and GPS numbers. GPS is becoming more common in guides, but here the driving instructions are painstaking and perhaps idiot proof. (Let me try them out before certifying them idiot proof.) More important, Petruzzi is moving the reader around a lot, intra-spot. The user is looking at an event from multiple angles - and I do mean multiple!\nOne"}

She and Fergus both pledged to safeguard public service jobs. Turmel\u2019s promises appeared to be accepted at face value, in large part because she was president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. Fergus, a past president of the Liberal Party who\u2019s been active in the community, was successful in distancing himself from the fact that the public service downsizing began under former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin.\nThe candidates were similarly on the same wavelength, with slight differences, in areas such as infrastructure development.\nAll of the major candidates made promises to improve mass transit in the widespread, booming riding. Continued growth in the riverside community has led to lots of upscale renovation with pretty bistros and shops along the old Aylmer Road leading to a bustling marina, creating a sort of West Quebec Westboro.\nBut the area is poorly served by both regular bus service and the Rapibus (Gatineau\u2019s Transitway system). Turmel and Fergus, along with Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate Maude Chouinard-Boucher and Green standard-bearer Roger Fleury, all pledged to fight for more money for transit improvements.\nSimilarly, there were assurances from all candidates on assistance for small business, social housing, environment. Different responses to the problems, assuredly, but serious proposals from most quarters.\nWhile the campaign mainly stayed on the high road there were two incidents which raised eyebrows and drew complaints to Elections Canada.\nThe first came late in September when ill-fated Conservative candidate Etienne Boulrice released confidential info on a funding request the city had made to the federal government to put on the Mosa\u00efcultures exhibit during Canada\u2019s 150th birthday celebrations in 2017.\nThe information \u2014 a request for about $14.5 million from the feds \u2014 isn\u2019t that shocking in and of itself.

{"idx": "31188", "prompt": "Continue the following text: While exploring the forests, rivers and mountains of Tennessee you may come across a snake. Luckily, only four of Tennessee's 32 native snake species are poisonous. There are various ways to identify whether or not a Tennessee snake is poisonous. It is illegal in Tennessee to kill, harm, threaten, catch or possess any wild snake, poisonous or not.\nAll of Tennessee's venomous snakes belong to the pit viper family. Pit vipers have a heat sensing pit at the front of their head, between their eyes. Due to this, non-venomous snakes have rounder eyes and their heads extend very little from their necks, making it difficult to tell where their neck ends and their body begins. A poisonous snake will have a more defined head extending from its body. Some species of non-poisonous snakes are more slender, longer and better climbers than their venomous counterparts. Non-venomous snakes may imitate the behavior of poisonous snakes as a defensive mechanism. This mimicry includes vibrating their tail to imitate a rattler, hissing, narrowing their head into an arrow and extending their jaws and taking an S-like strike stance. All of Tennessee's poisonous snakes give live birth, so if you see a snake guarding a nest of eggs you can assume it is not venomous. Only Tennessee's non-venomous snakes have a row of two overlapping scales on their underside, spanning from their vent to the tail tip.\nTwo varieties of rat snakes live in Tennessee: red and grey. These long, slender snakes can reach lengths of 42 to 101 inches. The red rat snake, also called a red cornsnake, is striped, while the grey rat snake's coloring is blotched. They are constrictors that feed on eggs, birds and mice.\nThree types of kingsnakes inhabit Tennessee: the prairie kingsnake, the black-speckled kingsnake and the scarlet kingsnake. As its name suggests, the prairie kingsnake frequents open fields and prairies. It varies in color, but is usually some shade of brown with black or green splotches. The black-speckled kingsnake, also known as the salt and pepper kingsnake, has black and white stripes. The scarlet kingsnake, a member of the milk snake subspecies of the kingsnake, is red with black-rimmed yellow bands. It is often mistaken for the coral snake; however, unlike the venomous coral snake, the scarlet kingsnake's bands do not encircle its body. Kingsnakes are constrictors, and in addition to rodents, lizards, eggs and birds, they feed on other snakes, including venomous snakes.\nMany of Tennessee's water snakes -- which include the broad-banded water snake, the common water snake, the Mississippi green water snake, the northern diamondback water snake and the copper-bellied water snake -- are mistaken for the copperhead because of their stout, heavy bodies and ability to flatten their heads into an arrow shape. Their usual dark or grey coloring is typically so intense that their patterns and markings do not show. As their name suggests, they live in the water, including Tennessee's rivers, swamps and creeks.\nThe common garter snake is prevalent throughout Tennessee. A medium-sized snake, the garter snake is typically pale green, yellow or brown with black stripes running down the length of its body. The coach whip is an incredibly fast, sl"}

That is, through what most of us would call maps --- bound in atlases or hanging on someone\u2019s office wall --- encompassing everything from Mercator projections on classroom rollers to Apollo-era star charts torn from NASA notebooks.\nAn eclectic new compilation of 300 maps --- chronicling 5,000 years of human history, culture and technology in a way that cuts across almost all disciplines --- is an innovative case in point.\nMap: Exploring The World, (Phaidon, 2015) is refreshingly non-digital in both its heft and subject matter. Much of the tome details rarely-seen reproductions of maps from much simpler, lower-tech eras. Although the book includes more than a few nods to our cartographic future, its maps mostly remind us of our instinctual fixation on knowing our physical whereabouts.\nPut together by Phaidon's editors, with help from an international panel of curators, academics, collectors and contributors, the book successfully juxtaposes sets of maps in a provocative manner, replete with substantial descriptions and contextual captions.\nOn the downside, there\u2019s not always a lot to tie the disparate maps together, which can sometimes leave the reader feeling adrift.

{"idx": "31192", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As a community, we are fortunate to have such good schools and excellent teachers. Recent actions by the Boulder Valley School District, however, have left me baffled. In the 1960s, a developer dedicated about 10 acres of land near the Twin Lakes to BVSD for a school or public educational purposes. BVSD says the need for a school never materialized, so now they say they\u2019d like to partner with the Boulder County Housing Authority to build affordable housing for teachers on the field. To do that, the district is requesting that the land-use designation be changed from public to mixed-density residential (which would allow up to 180 units on the 10 acres) and that the field be annexed into the city through county open space.\nAffordable housing for teachers sounds noble enough. Here\u2019s the pickle: Most teachers in Boulder Valley wouldn\u2019t qualify for affordable rental housing (which is what the housing authority has exclusively built in the last 10 years). To be eligible, a family of four must earn less than $59,640, which is 60 percent of the Area Median Income. The average salary for full-time teachers in BVSD is $74,500.\nThat\u2019s a great thing! Teachers should earn even more. It does raise questions, though, about BVSD\u2019s plans. Let\u2019s look more closely at the numbers, based on salary data obtained Feb. 4 through a Colorado Open Records Act request. To be conservative, we\u2019ll assume that the teacher is the sole breadwinner for a family of four.\n\u2022 Out of 1,595 full-time teachers, 1,274 (79.9 percent) make more than the $59,640 cap. That means 321 (20.1 percent) might potentially qualify for affordable rental housing, assuming no summer salary or other household income.\n\u2022 One hundred fifty-five of those 321 teachers make between $55,000 and $59,640 \u2014 so if their spouse or any additional income brings in $5,000 a year more, the teacher would be ineligible for affordable rental housing.\n\u2022 Of the 321 teachers who potentially qualify for affordable rental housing, 185 are first-, second-, or third-year teachers. Many of these early-career teachers are probably younger, may have roommates, and will be earning more as they advance. That leaves us with 136 teachers who have been teaching longer than three years and make less than $59,640.\n\u2022 Of those 136 teachers, only four work in Gunbarrel. Sixty-six work in Louisville, Lafayette, Superior, and Broomfield. Twenty-one work in South Boulder; 38 in more central Boulder; two in Nederland; one in Jamestown; and four have floating positions. So building up to 180 units in Gunbarrel makes little sense.\nIt is true that BVSD may have other options than rentals available, such as the BHP Homeworks program. This raises the eligibility requirements but significantly caps asset growth for teachers trying to build wealth. It\u2019s also true that some non-teaching staff may qualify, but BVSD\u2019s land-use-change application and communications have focused on teachers.\nThe plan is fraught with other problems, too. Since the development would receive federal funds, strict rules prohibit giving preference to certain workforces. BVSD planners have been unable"}

Abizaid, President Bush's nominee to head the U.S. Central Command, told a Senate committee Wednesday.\n\"Intelligence was the most accurate that I've ever seen on the tactical level, probably the best I've ever seen on the operational level, and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to weapons of mass destruction,\" Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nAbizaid's comments during confirmation hearings came as the Bush administration faces greater scrutiny from Congress on the decision to go to war. Lawmakers are questioning experts behind closed doors and poring over documents to determine whether the administration exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein or pressured intelligence analysts to skew their reports. In Britain, a parliamentary inquiry is examining whether Prime Minister Tony Blair's government did the same.\nBoth governments have denied any wrongdoing.\nAs U.S. and allied forces prepared to invade Iraq, Abizaid told senators, he asked his staff at the U.S. Central Command's temporary headquarters in Qatar, \"Is there anybody around this table who believes we will not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\" No one said no, he recalled.\nAnd as U.S. forces moved north toward Baghdad, \"I thought as we crossed what we termed the red line that we would overrun artillery units that had chemical warheads,\" the general said.\nAbizaid, who was second in command to Gen. Tommy Franks during the war, said he could not explain why banned weapons had not been found despite nearly 1,000 visits to suspect sites.\n\"It is perplexing to me, Senator, that we have not found weapons of mass destruction, when the evidence was so pervasive that it would exist,\" he said. \"I can't offer a reasonable explanation.... I don't know, and I think that we won't know for a while.\"\nBoth the British government and the Bush administration argued before the war that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons and a program to develop nuclear weapons and that these posed such an immediate threat to its neighbors and the United States that war was necessary to disarm the country.\nU.S. officials have scaled back those claims in recent weeks and now increasingly argue that Hussein's regime instead planned to reconstitute its unconventional arms programs if U.N. sanctions were lifted.\nEvidence for that argument was strengthened Wednesday when the CIA confirmed a CNN report that a former Iraqi nuclear scientist, Mahdi Shukur Ubaydi, had led intelligence officials to a cache of nuclear-related components and a 2-foot stack of documents he buried in 1991 under a rosebush at his Baghdad home.\nThe materials were from Iraq's vast but unsuccessful nuclear weapons programs of the 1980s. The cache had been hidden illegally from International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, who were responsible for dismantling Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons infrastructure after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Iraq's nuclear weapons effort was in effect destroyed by 1998, according to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.\nUbaydi said the buried components were \"part of a secret high-level plan to reconstitute the nuclear weapons program once sanctions ended,\" a U.S. intelligence official in Washington said.\n\"This is significant, but it doesn't prove Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear"}

The wine list is also shown on an iPad.\nFor more photos of the space and food, head to Hiroshi's Facebook page.\nSince the restaurant orders enough ingredients to accommodate eight people, Hiroshi has taken groups of five or six, but the diners pay the same price.

{"idx": "31208", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 After years of punishing rent increases, activists across Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area are pushing a spate of rent control proposals, driven by outrage over soaring housing prices and fears that the growing income gap is turning middle-class families into an endangered species. Those campaigns, if successful, would lead to the largest expansion of tenant laws since the 1970s.\nThe Bay Area may be a special case, with the growth of technology industries driving housing costs into the stratosphere and a California initiative system that allows citizens to put proposed laws on the ballot. But the state has a long history of being at the forefront of populist uprisings that spread across the country, and rent control movements have already popped up in other higher-cost cities like Portland, Ore., and Seattle.\nIn 1978, Proposition 13 sharply reduced California\u2019s property taxes, presaging a nationwide tax revolt. More recently, the state government adopted one of the nation\u2019s most expansive minimum wage laws, to $15 statewide by 2022, reflecting a populist tide against income inequality that the rent control effort is also riding.\n\u201cThis is happening so fast that we in the advocacy community can\u2019t even keep track of it,\u201d said Daniel Saver, a housing lawyer who is helping draft rent control proposals in several towns.\nInstead of being based in big cities like San Francisco, today\u2019s renters\u2019 rights movement is centered in the collection of suburbs and bedroom communities that fill the peninsula south of the city. Here, the collision of tech riches with decades of slow-growth development measures has pushed rent prices up about 50 percent over the last five years, according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service.\nToday, as in the 1970s, the economic prescription would be to build more and soon. But as tales of eviction spread and landlords raise prices to the limit, even people who acknowledge rent control\u2019s problems argue that it is still the best instrument to help middle-class families and lower-paid service employees who can no longer live close to work.\nSilicon Valley looks and feels suburban, lacking in pedestrians and full of single-family homes. It also has many tenants. In Mountain View, for instance, renters make up 60 percent of the households. And since this is a place where a $1 million starter home is considered a steal, those renters also include well-paid tech workers at some of the most valuable companies on earth.\nGoogle employees routinely show up at City Council meetings to speak out about rents and evictions. And after a 2014 election that served as a housing referendum by bringing Mr. Siegel and two other housing advocates onto the council, Mountain View is poised to add 15,000 new units, about a 40 percent increase in the housing stock.\nNevertheless, a group called the Mountain View Tenants Coalition is collecting signatures for a voter initiative in hopes of putting rent control on the November ballot. One of the group\u2019s leaders and its chief spokesman, Evan Ortiz, is a 29-year-old Google employee who works in ad sales.\nThomas K. Bannon, chief executive of the California Apartment Association, a landlords\u2019 group, said his members were mobilizing a statewide response and planning to spend millions of dollars \u2014 he would not estimate exactly how many millions \u2014 to beat back the initiatives one city at a time.

Jason Day is one round away from being in the race for No. 1 in the world.\nThe FedEx Cup playoffs suddenly are about a lot more than a $10-million bonus at the end.\nBae and Day traded birdies through the third round Saturday at Plainfield Country Club. Their best-ball score would have been 56. On their own, each had a 7-under 63 and were tied for the lead going at 11-under 199, one shot ahead of Bubba Watson (67).\nBae has to start his two-year military stint when he returns to South Korea. With a victory on Sunday, he would be assured a spot on the International team for the Presidents Cup, which is being held in his home country for the first time and will be the biggest golf event in South Korea.\nThe emotion comes from Palmer, who hasn\u2019t had a top 10 in the last three months. He is playing a week after his 71-year-old father died just north of Amarillo, Tex., when his SUV overturned. Palmer has found peaceful moments on the golf course, and while dropping two shots late in his round Saturday, he had a 65 and was two shots behind.\nAt times, Palmer caught himself wondering what it would mean to win with a family grieving at home.\nDay, just like he did on the par 5s at Whistling Straits when he won his first major two weeks ago, cracked a 343-yard drive down the middle on the 601-yard 16th hole, and then hit a 4-iron to 18 feet and holed it for eagle to tie for the lead.\nDay and Bae made bogey from the rough on the 17th, and both got up-and-down for birdie on the reachable 18th.\nA victory by the 27-year-old Australian would be his fourth win of the year, tying him with Jordan Spieth for most on the PGA Tour this year, and allow him to join the race for No. 1 going into the final month of the tour season.

{"idx": "31213", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A few months ago I went clickity clack and now I don't think I can go back. Let me show you the latest CM Storm mechanical keyboard.\nFor a long time I kind of felt that if you buy the most expensive keyboard, then you're probably going to be getting the best. For years I found myself exclusively a Logitech man with the latest one being a G19 with that fancy LCD screen. Being quite bored of it and getting sick of the fact that it required its own power, I finally thought I might look for a new keyboard.\nHaving getting right into watching the competitive StarCraft II scene and hearing how great mechanical keyboards were, I figured I'd take the jump and see what all the fuss was about. Within 30 seconds of owning my DAS Model S Professional, I was convinced it was the best keyboard I'd ever used.\nWith a new found love for the clickity clack of a mechanical keyboard, the latest piece of hardware to rock up came in the form of the CM Storm Quick Fire Rapid, a company that is a part of Cooler Master, but more focused on higher end gaming gear with the Quick Fire Rapid being the companies first foray into the keyboard market.\nPulling the Quick Fire Rapid out of the box for the first time, the one thing that really stands out above everything else is the complete lack of numpad included on the keyboard. This helps shave a fair bit of size off the overall keyboard and makes for something that looks pretty funky to be honest.\nGetting away from the keyboard for just a second, though, we have to look at the bundle. Yes, there's actually a bundle with the Quick Fire Rapid. Apart from the keyboard itself and the normal paperwork, CM Storm has included six extra key caps in the bundle along with a key cap puller.\nAs you can see above, we've got six extra key caps in the form of an up, down, left and right that can be used to replace the black WASD buttons that are included on the keyboard. Along with that, we've also got two \"CM\" buttons which can replace the start buttons if you want.\nIt's probably here when you finally figure out where the focus of the keyboard is. Combined with the lack of numpad and extra buttons that shift the focus to the WASD keys on the keyboard itself, it's clearly designed for those \"FPS\" gamers. The highlighted keys are a little funky and honestly, when you think about it, when was the last time you really used the numpad as a gamer? The chances are probably quite a while ago.\nReplacing the keys is an absolute breeze thanks to the inclusion of the key cap puller; it simply slides over the top of the key, you'll then hear it click in and then it's just a matter of pulling up until the key pops out. It's a hell of a lot nicer than grabbing a pen, trying to angle it in the right direction, pop the key and the duck as it flings out from the keyboard.\nWhile no cable comes out of the keyboard when pulled out of the package, the keyboard is indeed wired with a USB cable. Turning the keyboard over, you're able to see the mini USB port at the back where the cable is plugged in.\nOnce plugged in, you can then route the cable whichever way you choose. Originally I had it feed to the right as that's where my box is, but I quickly discovered that kind of interfered with my mouse a little bit, so I ended up routing it straight out from the back.

Bananas are a renowed staple food in the central and western parts of Uganda, an unlikely but invaluable raw material for paper.\nKampala, Uganda. You don\u2019t have to walk a very long distance anywhere in Uganda to see them; sticking out of the ground or lying on the surface. Black, green or stained clear, they could easily make for part of the environs. Except for one thing, they are polythene bags, a top enemy of the environment.\nThis non-biodegradable waste takes up to 400 years to decompose and thus chokes the soils, blocks the smooth water filtration and percolation into the soil, putting soil fertility in jeopardy. And that is not all.\nThe polythene bags, or kaveera as they are commonly known, also clog water channels and have often led to flooding or created breeding ditches for mosquitoes.\nWith over 39,600 tons of polythene waste released into the environment each year, the sight of polythene is something Ugandans have come to contend with. Not everyone though, at least not a then 23-year-old university student of Wood Science and Technology at Makerere University. What if a more environmentally\u2010friendly packaging material could be tailored to replace polythene bags?\nThis is a possibility Godfrey Atuheire pondered for a while, until he found the opportunity to bring his brilliant thought to life, and he seized it! The year was 2006 and he was doing research for his prospective school project at the Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI). Banana paper would be his solution, he realised. He would make his paper in the most environmentally friendly way, using banana fibre given that the banana plant is abundant in Uganda.\nAn internship at the institute after graduation fed his hunger for knowledge on making paper bags. It is then that he started making the paper bags out of banana stems at his home in Kinawataka, a Kampala suburb before relocating to his current operating premises in Kireka.\n\u201cI usually collect the banana stems free of charge from market places where they are readily available and always disposed of as waste. It is always better to use stems that are free of disease,\u201d says Atuheire, now aged 33. He chose to use banana stems to make the paper bags because the stems have the desired fibre length, high lignin and cellulose content compared to other alternatives like sisal, water hyacinth and papyrus. These are what counts in making a strong yet easy to fold paper.\nFibre is extracted from the banana stems by removing the soft part, as the inner fiber is what is used for making paper. Atuheire uses a machine called the extractor for this purpose. He acquired it at Shs3m (US$1,000) from UIRI. The extracted fiber is thereafter washed, cut into small pieces and cooked for three hours in pots and later cooled. It is this cooked material that is mixed with water and put into the pulping machine that beats and crushes the solution into pulp, a porridge like mixture. Starch is usually added to create a paper product that will not be prone to water penetration and in case the desired paper is to be coloured, the intended colour is added at this stage.\n\u201cWe then scoop the porridge\u2010like pulp using a casting net and put it under the"}

But Ms. Martin and others in this 208,000-student school district hope a federal initiative to encourage low-income students to consider college early on in their academic careers can help raise aspirations.\nGaining Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or Gear Up, is a national effort that partners middle schools with colleges, community organizations, and businesses. Programs vary at individual schools, but core elements remain the same: to promote rigorous, college-bound coursework, to work with a single grade level, and to increase college awareness.\nThe $200 million program, started in 1998, builds on existing efforts that use mentoring, tuition assistance, and curriculum support to retain students and expose them to college. It targets students starting no later than 7th grade and serves more than 700,000 students in 237 partnerships.\nExperts say many students from poor families don't pursue college because they lack access to information about higher education and don't realize the importance of taking college-preparatory classes. In fact, U.S. Department of Education research shows that more affluent students are about seven times more likely than those from disadvantaged backgrounds to earn four-year college degrees by age 24, and that a baccalaureate degree can boost annual income by as much as $15,000 a year.\nPresident Clinton is one of Gear Up's primary backers, encouraging colleges to work with students as early as 6th grade. Mr. Clinton, who visited a Philadelphia middle school last spring to encourage Gear Up students, wants to increase funding to $325 million next year to include another 1 million students.\n\"This is a story of what partnerships can be,\" Rep.

The laboriously constructed agreement to phase out trade barriers among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which this page has strongly supported, is likely to have a positive, though small, impact on U.S. living standards and provide a modest boost to the Mexican economy. Some American jobs would be lost to cheaper Mexican labor, other jobs would be gained because American exports would increase as Mexico's high tariffs gradually disappeared.\nEconomics aside, Nafta's defeat would suggest that the U.S. had abandoned its historical commitment to free trade and would thus discourage other Latin and South American countries that (as Washington has long suggested) have moved toward more market-oriented economies in the expectation of freer world trade.\nMr. Perot dismisses the foreign policy implications while manhandling the economic data. In a nine-month anti-Nafta crusade that has taken him to 43 states and 91 cities, he has warned that Nafta would cause American industry and agriculture to flee south with \"a giant sucking sound\" toward cheaper Mexican labor, costing Americans 5.9 million jobs.\nThis is an absurd calculation that Mr. Perot, made giddy perhaps by his resurgent notoriety, has now taken to truly stratospheric levels of exaggeration.

The teacher has been placed on paid administrative leave per district policy.\"\nThe girl was avoiding the pool that day because she had had her hair done that morning and had an event to attend that night.

Today, Gail is a business and philanthropic icon whose value and importance to Utah is immeasurable.\nAnother Utah business giant is Carol Holding who, with her husband, Earl, purchased a run-down truck stop west of Green River, Wyoming, and built a remarkable business empire. Carol and Earl pumped gas and waited on tables in their early marriage, working shoulder-to-shoulder for many decades.\nCarol\u2019s influence continues to be seen in nearly every detail and the amazing customer service offered in the firm\u2019s hotels, ski resorts, the oil industry and in the loyalty of employees.\nFinally, Amy Rees Anderson is the managing partner and founder of Rees Capital, an angel investment firm that provides entrepreneurs and business executives critical guidance and support to help their companies grow.

The 2018 numbers will be available next fall.\nThe data, provided in bulk to protect individual businesses' privacy, will be a powerful tool in helping brokers sell downtown, CBID marketing coordinator Robin Thomas said.\nNumbers seem consistent with the development occurring downtown, according to broker and developer Tim Hill, of Hatcher-Hill Properties. He is also chairman of the CBID board.\nThe data indicates 2016 was a critical point for downtown growth. In 2015, revenue had grown 7.09 percent from the year before. In 2016, revenues increased by 13.81 percent.\nCBID director Michele Hummel said there's not been a \"silver bullet\" to the growth \u2014 it's a combination of factors like the increase in downtown residents, that downtown attracts many demographics, city infrastructure improvements and programs like the CBID's Elf on the Shelf to get more customers in stores.\nThe area population is set for more growth. Almost 2,000 housing units are downtown, and there are 16 announced projects providing an additional 1,183 units, according to an August News Sentinel story. And many of those residences are mixed use, with retail space on the ground floor, adding more commercial space to the market.\nThe CBID also tracks new businesses. Sixteen opened downtown in 2017, and 26 in 2018 through Oct. 30.\nHill said the area is somewhere in the middle of its overall growth.\n\"We\u2019re going to see a continued rise in retail sales in the downtown area,\u201d he said.\nThomas wanted some clarity to the growth, so she pulled revenues for restaurants and retail citywide, including the CBID.\nIn 2017, there was 5 percent growth citywide, compared with the CBID's 10.7 percent.

That memorable season, the Hawks had their share of scares in the playoffs, but did it ever really feel like they wouldn't win? Not to me. The Hawks were so much better, so much deeper than any team in the NHL, it was almost a foregone conclusion. Sure, Nashville gave the Hawks a bit of a scare. Vancouver was feisty and annoying as well. The Hawks rolled over the San Jose Sharks, and the 2-0 series lead they built over the Philadelphia Flyers gave them room for error in that series.\nThis year...it doesn't feel quite as simple, does it? Again, the Hawks are the deepest team in the playoffs. They had the best regular season. But nothing about this series with the Boston Bruins is going to be easy. Tuukka Rask will see to that.\nDespite the most dominant period of playoff hockey I've seen in recent memory, the Hawks were unable to solve Rask, and he out-dueled Corey Crawford in Game Two. Nineteen 1st period shots, and only one got past Rask. The Bruins were credited with four shots in that frame, and only attempted six. The Hawks could have (maybe should have) been up 3-0 when that 1st period horn sounded. Instead, it was 1-0, and the Bruins were only a shot away.\nWhen that shot came, it was a different game. Chris Kelly's game tying goal, for all intents and purposes, allowed the Bruins to hit the reset button and start from scratch. The game was tied. The first period beat down didn't matter anymore. The Bruins, from that point on, took it to the Hawks. They were more physical. They dictated the play. They had the better chances in overtime.\nNow, as we prepare for Game Three Monday night in Boston, we find ourselves looking for answers. If the Hawks can't score after dominating a period like they did, how can they do it in Boston on the Bruins home ice?\nFor starters, the Hawks can keep it simple, like they did in the 1st period Saturday. There was nothing fancy or advanced about their strategy. They took the chances that were given to them and drove the net hard.\nHow about a functional powerplay? When the Hawks finally enter the zone and get set up, they stand still. Patrick Kane held the puck for 3-4 seconds before deciding where to move. Good powerplays are constantly in motion. Even bad powerplays are constantly in motion. The Hawks just stand there, waiting for a lane to open up.

Research firm IHS predicts shipments of OLED smartphone panels will overtake LCDs in 2020.\nAlready, some less well-known Japanese equipment makers including Canon Tokki Corp and Dai Nippon Printing Co have seen strong OLED-related orders from Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics, and other global panel makers.\nThe success of those firms reflects a broader trend in Japan\u2019s consumer electronics sector. Former giants such as Sharp and Sony Corp have struggled against the scale of their Asian rivals, while lesser-known manufacturers have survived by developing niche technologies.\nTokki, a Canon Inc unit which makes vacuum evaporators used in making OLED panels, has an order book of several years, according to industry executives.\nCEO Teruhisa Tsugami told Reuters Tokki plans to double production capacity this year to meet strong demand from clients including South Korean, Japanese and Chinese panel makers. \u201cThe OLED market is suddenly flourishing on news that Apple is expected to adopt the technology,\u201d Tsugami said.\nTokki has spent years working closely with Samsung to develop equipment best suited for making smartphone panels. Its competitors include South Korea\u2019s SFA Engineering Corp and Japan\u2019s Ulvac Inc.\nJapanese manufacturers began investing in OLED technology in the 1990s, led by Sony and Pioneer Corp. Most have since given up due to the high costs and defect rates, but smaller equipment makers in the supply chain have kept at it, largely helped by growing sales to Samsung and LG Display.\nDai Nippon Printing has become a leader in producing evaporation masks, used to coat light-emitting materials at precise locations on panels. It said last month it will triple its production capacity by 2020.\n\u201cThat decision was based on our forecast of growth in the OLED market,\u201d said Mitsuru Tsuchiya, general manager of Dai Nippon Printing\u2019s fine optronics division.\nWith Sharp and Japan Display as well as Chinese display makers such as BOE Technology Group and Tianma Microelectronics expanding investment in OLED production, the market is seen growing 16 percent a year to $44 billion by 2020, according to a Markets and Markets report.\nNikon Corp expects orders from global panel makers to drive up shipments of its lithography equipment - which project circuit patterns on to flat panels - by more than three quarters in the year to March.\nThe firm, better known for its cameras, reckons operating profit this year from flat panel lithography equipment alone will hit 50 billion yen ($472 million), helping offset the impact of weaker camera demand. That\u2019s more than its profit forecast for the overall company.\nShares of Ulvac, which is more exposed to panel equipment manufacturing than other diversified Japanese peers, jumped 64 percent over the past one year, versus a 22 percent decline in the wider market."}

The Google Home voice-based hardware unit brings its assistant to life, making traditional inputs and displays unnecessary. With just the power of your voice, you can interact with the device -- nothing else is needed.\nThe search giant has decided to take artificial intelligence to the maker community with a new initiative called AIY. This initiative (found here) will introduce open source AI projects to the public that makers can leverage in a simple way. Today, Google announces the first-ever AIY project. Called \"Voice Kit,\" it is designed to work with a Raspberry Pi to create a voice-based virtual assistant. Please keep in mind that the Pi itself is not included, so you must bring your own. For this project, you can use a Pi 3 Model B, Pi 2, or Pi Zero. Want a Voice Kit? Here's how to get it. Heck, you might be getting one for free and you don't even know it.\n\"The first open source reference project is the Voice Kit: instructions to build a Voice User Interface (VUI) that can use cloud services (like the new Google Assistant SDK or Cloud Speech API) or run completely on-device. This project extends the functionality of the most popular single board computer used for digital making -- the Raspberry Pi,\" says Billy Rutledge, Director of AIY Projects, Google.\nRutledge further explains, \"The included Voice Hardware Accessory on Top (HAT) contains hardware for audio capture and playback: easy-to-use connectors for the dual mic daughter board and speaker, GPIO pins to connect low-voltage components like micro-servos and sensors, and an optional barrel connector for dedicated power supply. It was designed and tested with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.\"\nGoogle shares some potential uses for this particular AIY project below.\nAdd voice recognition to assistive robotics (e.g. for accessibility) -- just talk to the robot as a simplified programming interface, e.g. \"tell me what's in this room or \"tell me when you see the mail-carrier come to the door\"\nIf you want to score yourself one of these kits, you can actually get it free -- if you are an existing subscriber to MagPi Magazine, that is. It will come packaged with the latest issue. Not a subscriber? Don't panic. If you are in the USA, you can soon purchase it from a Barnes and Noble retail location.

It also has to do with the increasing pressures of public opinion both inside and outside the country. While there isn't much sympathy in Egypt for Hamas, there is a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian civilians who are suffering under the tight blockade imposed on the Hamas-controlled strip and who would be vulnerable in a military offensive, said Gamal Abdel Gawad, head of the international relations unit at the Cairo-based al-Ahram Center for Strategic and Political Studies. \"The Egyptian public cannot tolerate a massive Israeli military operation in Gaza in which Palestinians will be hurt, particularly civilians,\" Gawad said. An escalation of violence there \"would make the living conditions much worse. There will be a political cost for Egypt and the Egyptian government has to do something about it.\" It was reported Thursday night that Defense Minister Ehud Barak has instructed troops to open Gaza crossings Friday for humanitarian supplies. Massive public protests against Israel and in support of Palestinians are not uncommon in Cairo when tensions or violence flare with Israel. There were particularly frequent and angry demonstrations at the start of the second intifada. Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Israel. \"If you expose the Egyptian government or any government to pressure, to criticism, this could be destabilizing,\" Gawad said. There is also the fear that an Israeli attack in Gaza would allow Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and other radical forces to use it as a pretext to mobilize their public and strengthen their position in the country, he added. \"Palestine is an easy and cheap way to move the Arab public in any country,\" he said. \"This is something that people in Israel should recognize.\" Egypt has also been the recipient of mounting criticism and pressure from states such as Syria and Iran, which have accused it of siding against the Palestinian people by not opening its Rafah border crossing to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. However the crossings from Egypt to Gaza are regulated by an international agreement between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and the European Union rather than Hamas, which Egypt is not eager to legitimize because of its illegal takeover in 2007, Gawad said. In addition, the agreement - which Egypt considers important to respect - designates Rafah as a crossing for individuals rather than for goods. Yet Hamas is \"very successful\" in making its case and showing the deteriorating situation in Gaza, which has an impact on public opinion, said Dr. Abdel Monem Said Aly, director of the al-Ahram Center. \"Hamas could solve the problem by giving the crossing points to the Palestinian Authority; that's the agreement,\" Aly said. \"If we have the Palestinian Authority there, we will have the European Union there accordingly... and we will have the right actors in place.\" Then if the Israelis rejected aid at that point, he added, they would be the ones to blame. \"If Israel were to allow more aid from Egypt into Gaza, it would help Egypt domestically by showing that the country at least is doing its best to minimize the damage from a humanitarian perspective,\" Aly said. Israel has sealed the borders with the Strip during the last nine days due to security reasons. Egypt is also dealing with the global economic crisis and does not need another crisis similar to Israel's Second Lebanon War with Hizbullah on its borders, Aly said. \"That is the last thing"}

The remaining statistics, which pertain to older Android versions, show 2014\u2019s 5.0 Lollipop update standing in at a 35.1 percent adoption rate \u2014 that\u2019s a measly 0.3 percent decrease. Moving down the timeline gets us to 2013\u2019s 4.4 KitKat update, which currently has a 30.1 percent adoption rate, with Jelly Bean \u2014 three versions were released in 2012 and 2013 \u2014 sitting at 17.8 percent.\nGoogle collects these numbers by counting any Android device that accessed the Google Play Store during a seven-day period that ended on July 11.\nOverall, adoption rates are down across the board, with Marshmallow\u2019s statistic representing the only increase. That\u2019s good because it means more devices are jumping to the current version of Android. What\u2019s not good is the fact that a 3- to 4-year-old operating system is still more widely used than the latest version, an issue compounded by Apple iOS 9 update\u2019s 84-percent adoption rate.\nMarshmallow has been available to Android device manufacturers for nine months, begging the question of why Marshmallow is taking so long to make its way to devices.\nAs of late, these adoption rates are not just for show and tell \u2014 software updates have become crucial because they now fix security vulnerabilities, thus making the operating system more secure. Unfortunately, even though manufacturers have followed Google\u2019s lead in issuing monthly security updates, carriers have not played ball. As a result, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission sent letters to manufacturers and carriers, inquiring about the security process and how they push updates to consumers.\nFinally, because so many people use older versions of Android, this puts app developers in quite a bind. Yes, app compatibility can often stretch out to these older versions, but developers have to code for several different Android versions, which brings up the question of app updates. For its part, Google will reportedly rank top Android device makers in terms of how up-to-date their devices are, and the firm is still considering whether or not to release this list to the public.\nThese numbers are only going to get even more fragmented soon, as Android Nougat will soon be available. The upcoming Android version\u2019s developer preview was released earlier this year, in the hopes that it would be sent to device manufacturers and carriers sooner. Google wants these groups to push out the update to consumers in a timely manner once the final version lands, which will likely be toward the end of summer or early fall."}

Not to mention profile pictures and Facebook cover photos relating to the conflict.\nMy cousin\u2019s issue was not with the sentiment of these messages.\nOf course she doesn\u2019t condone the injustices that are and have been taking place in the Middle East, or the loss of many Palestinian lives.\nHer point was observational: no one posts about Palestine before Ramadan and soon after it, she reckoned.\nThose posts would disappear and people would turn to more pressing personal issues that would occupy their posts on Facebook \u2013 like what they ate, or wore or did that day.\nShe was annoyed with the false and short-lived sense of activism, and what seemed like a sudden and shallow awareness and kinship regarding the Muslim people of Palestine by the Muslim people on her Facebook wall.\nDid they feel like their social media activism was necessary to portray themselves as conscientious practising Muslims during one of the most significant religious months in Islam?\nInitially I agreed with her without much engagement. I, too, had noticed an influx of these very posts on my wall. But without wanting to sound politically incorrect or insensitive to the plight of the people in Palestine, I reserved further comment and analysis.\nAlso, in all fairness, the incessant posts and social media activism coincided not only with the month of fasting, but also with one of the biggest attacks the Israeli military has ever issued on that territory.\nHundreds of innocent lives, including those of children, continue to be lost. And I paid a bit more attention. The issue is of significance not only to Muslim people, but to the international community.\nMany people of different backgrounds have taken a stance, joined protests, marched and shared their views and opinions on social media.\nAnd, while social media provides a space for the voices of many \u2013 including no less the people of Palestine who use it to mobilise support and have their voices heard \u2013 I have noticed that there are many who share a lot via social media, but say very little.\nHas posting in protest become a vehicle for popularity during the month of Ramadan? Will I think you\u2019re a better Muslim because you have repeatedly shared \u201cFree Palestine\u201d posters all over your Facebook wall?\nThese questions are not unsubstantiated. When I was at university, it was very popular among the more verbose of the Muslim Students Association to hate the United States and all things American.\nParticipating in marches and the occasional burning of a flag here and there definitely made you a good Muslim. I didn\u2019t quite understand the notion.\nThe specific group of people to whom I am referring were also wealthy and often wore expensive American brands. The point of protest became very clear to me at that stage. It was selective. It was done (not necessarily by everyone) because it was popular instead of political.\nDuring one altercation, I was attacked and openly criticised for wearing a T-shirt with a US badge on it. Why was I being anti-Islam?\nRallying together during specific times on the Islamic calendar has long been a trend. Ramadan is a period that is signified by a fast from"}

That's unacceptable.\"\nThe board denied Hall's request this week during a jacket review, which is the first step towards possible commutation.\n\"Unfortunately, the Pardon and Parole Board offered no reason and no commentary on why they were denying her opportunity for commutation,\" Shinn said. \"Frankly, we'd love an explanation.\"\nNews 4 made multiple attempts Thursday to reach the board, both via email and phone. Only one out of five members returned our request.\nBoard member Kris Steele said he does not condone the failure to report but he did vote in favor of Hall.\n\"In reviewing her file, it appears the abuser had threatened her verbally and made it clear that if she did report anything that he would do even more harm to her and/or the children in the home,\" Steele said. \"It just does not make sense to me that she would receive a harsher punishment than the person who actually was found guilty of the abuse.\"\nHall's request was not the one that was denied. The board also rejected requests from Stephanie Avery, Tonya Moss and Ashley Garrison.\n\"There was documented evidence in the file that the woman, the mother was also a victim of what it is called intimate partner abuse,\" Steele said. \"I believe in at least three of the four cases, the actual abuser received a more lenient sentence than did the person who was deemed abused.\"\nRegarding parole and pardon requests, neither the board members or the governor are required to disclosure their reasoning for decisions.\nAccording to Steele, it is \"the custom of the board not to disclose that kind of information.\" It is unusual for the board to even discuss a case.\nSteele said, in his opinion, that should change.\n\"The research that I\u2019ve read indicates that giving a reason or stating those factors actually improve public safety inside the prison system,\" he said.\nThe women now must wait three years before reapplying for commutation.

In order to facilitate and encourage people to help set the record, boxes of tennis racquets and tennis balls were on hand at Blair Arch, contributed by University Athletics, Princeton Tennis Club, Prince as wellas Dillon Gymnasium.\nClaxton said that the Guinness World Records receives about 50,000 inquiries every year from all over the world. When inquiries for new records such as the tennis outfit record arrive at Guinness, the records management team discusses the proposal and if the idea is approved, guidelines are designed for the record-setting event. Particularly, Claxton explained that the team looks for records that are verifiable, measurable and breakable."}

So as plentiful fossil fuels saturate global markets, it has become cheaper for the makers of water bottles, yogurt containers and takeout boxes to simply buy new plastics. This, in turn, is dragging down the price of recycled materials, straining every part of the recycling industry.\nOur recycling business has dramatically changed, from a business we thought was going to grow very fast and very profitable, to one that is not growing at all and not profitable.\nIn Plaquemines Parish, just south of New Orleans, Republic Services decided to double the fees it charged the local government to collect and process recyclables. The cost was too high, and the parish said it would end its recycling program at the end of the month, only to reverse course after a public outcry led by energetic seventh-graders.\nWe\u2019re at the mercy of oil prices and markets like everybody else.

Their appointment comes a month after Viacom cut about 100 jobs at Awesomeness and said goodbye to CEO Jordan Levin, who had announced he would leave the company after its sale to Viacom in July.\nIn their new roles, Glashow and Zimmerman will oversee the Awesomeness studio, social media, marketing, production, programming and distribution. Glashow will lead the company from New York, where Viacom is headquartered, while Zimmerman will be based out of Awesomeness' main offices in Los Angeles.\nA Discovery Communications veteran, Glashow joined Awesomeness in 2016 to lead worldwide distribution and reported to Day, who jumped to Viacom in November of last year. Her role eventually expanded to chief strategy and distribution officer. Zimmerman, meanwhile, came to Awesomeness from Warner Horizon in late 2015. The move gave her oversight of the Awesomeness television studio.\n\"Rebecca and Shelley continue to be a driving force at the heart of Awesomeness,\" said Day. \"I've had the pleasure of working with Rebecca and Shelley for years. Their contributions have been instrumental in the company's success, and they have a distinct ability to grow and leverage the brand with the strength of their combined creative and operational expertise and leadership.\"\nFounded by Brian Robbins and Joe Davola during the boom of original channels on YouTube, teen-skewed Awesomeness sold to DreamWorks Animation in 2013 and began to focus on producing original programming for digital and traditional distribution. Later, Hearst and Verizon both bought into the business. When DWA sold to NBCUniversal in 2016, Awesomeness became a division of Universal. This summer, the three owners decided to sell Awesomeness to Viacom in a deal valued at less than $100 million, per insiders.\nFollowing the sale, Viacom said that it would lay off some of the staff as it absorbed the business into its Digital Studios group. A filing with the Employment Development Department revealed that about half the staff, or 98 employees, would be let go. Though the cuts occurred across the company, duplicative positions in legal, finance and human resources were said to be the focus.\nGlashow and Zimmerman have been given the mandate to concentrate on creating digital programming that is distributed outside of linear television, a bigger focus for Viacom as its network of cable properties sees declining ratings amid cord-cutting. Under their guidance, Awesomeness will invest in its studio business and develop content for its social channels with an eye toward scripted series for teen girls and young adults. This strategy is surely informed by the buzz for its Netflix teen rom-com, To All the Boys I've Loved Before, which helped to mint the fame of its young stars, Lana Condor and Noah Centineo.

In fact, HR experts such as Career Horizons president Matt Youngquist and Epic Development and Evaluation owner Howard Poplinger state that only approximately 20 to 30 percent of vacant positions are advertised online. So how do you find out about these positions if they're not accessible online? The answer is simple: research, professional networking and determination.\nDon\u2019t wait around for positions to be posted on an Internet job board. The best way to begin your job search offline is to compile a list of local companies you'd be interested in working for based on criteria such as geographic location, size and industry. You can gather this data from offline resources such as newspaper advertisements, media articles, phone book directory listings and word of mouth. Keep an eye on your local news as well for tips on businesses making the headlines for things such as mass hiring, relocation or grand openings.\nReview your resume and whenever possible tailor it to the specific company or position you're applying for. This will help you stand out from the sea of generic resumes that inundates recruiters during the typical recruiting process by affording you the opportunity to showcase your relevant experience. For example, you may revise your objective statement or elaborate on your prior work experience to make a clear correlation between your skills and the requirements the recruiter is seeking.\nInstead of simply emailing a resume and waiting to be contacted, opt for a more proactive approach by initiating contact with the human resources department or hiring manager. You can do this with a simple phone call or even an in-person visit to introduce yourself and communicate what you're looking for and why you'd be the best candidate for the job. Remember that recruiters often have busy schedules. You won't likely speak with each company representative directly, but don't let a few unresponsive businesses deter you from your job search efforts. Persistence is key when searching for unadvertised employment opportunities.\nWork on building your professional network by meeting and exchanging information with professionals in your field or joining a local group such as the chamber of commerce or an industry-specific organization.

{"idx": "31295", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the fall of 2007, I had been working for several months on a proposal for the authorized biography of Cheeta, Johnny Weissmuller's sidekick in MGM's Tarzan movies of the 1930s and '40s. Against all odds, Cheeta was still alive at the age of 75, 20 years older than a captive chimp's normal life span. When the agent for Cheeta and his owner, Dan Westfall, had first approached me about writing the biography, I was astonished that a fixture of not just my own childhood, but my parents', as well, one of the most celebrated animals in movie history, was retired in Palm Springs, Calif., selling his paintings for $135 donations to thousands of far-flung admirers. His birthday parties were now covered by national, and even international, media. At Cheeta's 75th birthday party, his owner, who runs a non-profit primate sanctuary, had played a video of Jane Goodall attempting to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him in the pant-hooting language of the wild chimps she had first observed in Tanzania in the early 1960s. Could there be higher tribute to a chimp than that?\nI was too absorbed in the many fascinating aspects of my research -- the history of men and their captive chimps, the early days of Hollywood animal training, the evolution of the Tarzan franchise, newspaper clips about Cheeta, not to mention a meeting with the fading star himself -- to indulge any incipient doubts about Cheeta's true identity. To be honest, I was also too enchanted with what I had been told was the project's potential lucrativeness to question its premise; the agent's casual claim that she \"never gets out of bed for less than a quarter of a million dollars\" had worked its magic on me.\nBut one oft-repeated fact about the chimp's life nagged at me. It was one of the standard stories in Cheeta's biography -- repeated in Newsweek and other magazines, recited by Cheeta's current owner and many Cheeta admirers -- that the first of his two owners, animal trainer Tony Gentry, had gotten him in Liberia as a baby and smuggled him under his overcoat aboard a Pan Am flight home in 1932. During the long flight, the diapered Cheeta escaped from under Gentry's coat, mischievously scampered up and down the aisle, and had to be subdued by hysterical stewardesses with a bottle of warm milk.\nAfter four months of research and writing, I decided to ask a question that, in retrospect, was so obvious that it was curious that no journalist before me had bothered to ask it: In 1932, were there any transatlantic flights for Gentry to smuggle Cheeta onto? The answer, I wasn't surprised to learn, was no. Transatlantic commercial airline service wasn't inaugurated until 1939.\nEarly on, I had raised the issue of documenting Cheeta's age. Obviously, I had to be protected against the possibility that, if I published a biography of the world's oldest chimpanzee, someone would make a fool out of me, my reputation, my publisher, Cheeta, his owner, and the agent by proving he was not 75. But at that early stage, it seemed a mere formality, and I had no idea even what such documentation would consist"}

But before considering that, it is necessary to consider the context of the announcement.\nThe Department of Justice, which had, based on evidence already revealed, actually interfered in the 2016 election more that Moscow could possibly have done, continued in that proud tradition by releasing the indictment three days before President Donald Trump was due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Helsinki Summit between the two leaders was critically important to anyone interested in preserving the planet Earth as we know it and there was no reason at all to release a non-time sensitive document that was clearly intended to cast a shadow over the proceedings. In fact, the surfacing of the indictment might easily be explained as a deliberate attempt by a politicized Justice Department and Special Counsel Robert Mueller to torpedo President Trump over concerns that he might actually come to some understanding with Putin.\nThe Russia Hoax: The I... Gregg Jarrett Best Price: $6.47 Buy New $12.22 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details) The 30-page long indictment is full of painstaking details about alleged Russian involvement but it makes numerous assertions that the reader is required to accept on faith because there is little or no evidence provided to back up the claims and the claims themselves could be false trails set up by any number of hostile intelligence services to implicate Moscow. From an intelligence officer\u2019s point of view, there are even some significant areas where operational implausibility completely undermines the case being made.\nAll twelve alleged GRU officers are described in detail, together with the cover mechanisms they reportedly used and the targets they pursued. But they are all in Russia and there is virtually no chance that they will be extradited to stand trial in Washington, which was certainly understood when the indictment was prepared. That means the \u201cfacts\u201d as stated in the document will never be subjected to the normal judicial review process or discovery that takes place whenever someone is accused of a crime, which in turn means that information contained in the indictment will never be challenged.\nThe document itself also provides no information on how the Russian officers and their positions were identified, which suggests that it could have been a US hack or agent in place, either run by CIA or NSA, that came up with a list of those individuals connected to GRU cyber operations. That would be information involving sources and methods, codeword protected material beyond Top Secret.\nIf the GRU list is authentic, it would expose US ability to penetrate that organization, leading to Moscow tightening up security to the detriment of American intelligence. But it might alternatively be suggested that the drafters needed a group of plausible Russians and used a generic list provided by either CIA or NSA to come up with the culprits and then used those identities and the detailed information regarding them to provide credibility to their account. What they did not do, however, is provide the actual evidence connecting the individuals to the \u201chack/interference\u201d or to connect the same to the Russian government. If the information in the indictment is completely accurate, which may not be the case, there is some suggestion that alleged Moscow linked proxies may have deliberately sought to undermine the campaign of Hillary Clinton to favor Bernie Sanders, but absolutely no evidence that they did anything to help Donald Trump.\nIf the Kremlin\u2019s objective were truly to undermine American democracy, a task that"}
{"idx": "31299", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon as his chief strategist has been criticized on the grounds that Bannon is an antisemite. There are many reasons for opposing the appointment of Bannon, but antisemitism is not one of them. I do not support the Bannon appointment, but neither do I support accusing him of being an antisemite, based on the evidence I have seen.\nWith regards to antisemitism, there are three distinct but overlapping issues: Is Bannon personally an antisemite? Does his publication, Breitbart, promote antisemitic views? And do Breitbart and Bannon have followers who are antisemitic?\nLet us consider these items of evidence in order. Senator Harry Reid tried to strengthen the first accusation against Bannon by saying that it appeared in a \u201ccourt document,\u201d thus suggesting that it had the imprimatur of a judge. But that is not the case. The claim was simply made by his former wife in a judicial proceeding, thus giving it no special weight. Bannon has rigorously denied making the statement, and said that he and his wife were fighting over whether his children should attend Catholic school, rather than a secular school.\nOn the other side of the ledger is the testimony of Jewish individuals who have worked closely with him for years. These include my former research assistant, Joel Pollak, an Orthodox Jew who wears a kippah and takes off work for all the Jewish holidays. He is married to a black woman from South Africa who converted to Judaism. Joel assures me that he never heard a single antisemitic utterance or saw an antisemitic action in the four years he worked together with Bannon. The same is true of numerous other Jewish individuals who work with him, some of whom thoroughly disapprove of Bannon\u2019s politics and the way he ran Breitbart, but none of whom have reported any events of antisemitism.\nThe second alleged item of evidence is the following headline that appeared on Breitbart: \u201cBill Kristol Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew.\u201d I am advised, however, that this article and the headline were written not by Bannon but rather by David Horowitz, a right-wing Jew who was upset with Kristol for his refusal to support Trump. Horowitz deemed that a betrayal of the Jewish people. While I fundamentally disagree with that appraisal and also with the article, I find it hard to characterize Bannon as an antisemite because Breitbart ran it. Breitbart has also personally attacked me (in an article, originally published with the title \u201cDershowitz Goes Berserk,\u201d which falsely claimed Laureate University received money from the State Department, when Hillary Clinton was secretary), but that doesn\u2019t change my views.\nAs to whether Bannon promotes the alt-right, and whether the alt-right includes antisemites, I think the answer to that is yes. Both Bannon and Breitbart have made bigoted statements about Muslims, women and others, which I do not condone. That is why I do not support Bannon, even though I do not think he\u2019s an antisemite. Bigotry against any group should be disqualifying for high office. But let\u2019s put this criticism of Bannon and Breitbart into context. Haaretz certainly serves as a platform for the alt-left in Israel. Though it features a wide range of commentary, primarily from the center-Left, it also features hard-Left writers such as Gideon Levy, who supports academic, cultural and economic boycot"}

{"idx": "31317", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Britain is well placed to deal with the possibility of a Russian cutoff of gas to Europe during the Ukraine crisis, because it receives most of its imports from Norway and has significant domestic reserves.\nAs relations worsen between Kiev and Moscow, European gas customers fear that Russia could cut off exports to Ukraine, which is an important transit route for natural gas to the European Union.\nRussia supplies around a third of Europe\u2019s gas, some 40 percent of which it ships through Ukraine. Gazprom has threatened to cut supplies if Ukraine continues to fail to pay its bills and has warned of a possible reduction in onward deliveries to Europe.\nAlthough Britain does not import Russian gas directly, it does receive some gas from the continent, to which Russia exports over 160 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year.\nBritain\u2019s supply risks mainly involve a disruption to Norwegian gas supply or turmoil in the Middle East, which could affect imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.\n\u201cThe physical problem of interruptions at this time of year is low. We are in spring and going into summer, and we have low demand and a lot of gas in storage,\u201d Jonathan Stern, chairman of the Natural Gas Research Programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Reuters.\nAnother factor that will affect Britain\u2019s gas market for years to come is the drop in its domestic production by about two thirds from its peak in 2000 to 37 bcm a year now, less than half of annual demand.\nThe government hopes the decline will slow and that Britain will still produce 19 bcm of North Sea gas by 2030.\nBut if the decline does not slow, Britain will run out of home-produced gas by the early 2020s, doubling its current annual import bill of 8.48 billion pounds ($14.2 billion) to 16 billion pounds within a decade.\nBecoming an import-dependent country increases supply risks.\nBritain\u2019s two single biggest suppliers are Norway, which pumps its gas through the North Sea via several pipelines, and LNG imports from overseas, mostly from Qatar.\nNorway\u2019s exports to Britain are expected to remain stable at around 25-30 bcm for the next decade at least, but LNG sourcing, volumes and prices will vary widely as Britain competes with buyers in Asia and Latin America, where gas prices are higher than in Europe.\n\u201cDemand in Asia for LNG is high and still rising, despite high transportation costs. If the U.S. decides to increase its LNG exports, Europe will have to reach into its pocket to prevent all LNG from being shipped to Asia,\u201d said Hans van Cleef, a senior energy economist at ABN Amro.\nThe two main ways that Britain could improve its supplies would be to boost its own shale gas output and increase its storage capacity, allowing it to create a cushion against potential disruptions.\nBecause Britain in the past could rely on its own production, its gas storage sites, even when fully topped up, can meet only around two weeks\u2019 worth of demand. This compares with around 15 weeks in France or Germany, which have always relied largely on imported gas.\nAs Britain\u2019s resources dwindle, pressure has mounted to invest more in storage capacity, especially since 2013 when an unusually long winter almost depleted its stocks, causing extreme price spikes and fears of outages.\nDespite these calls, British utility Centrica called off two gas storage projects"}

This is partly due to the rise of online shopping and party due to the fact that young people prioritize experiences over material goods. If you own a clothing boutique, you might wonder what it takes to succeed. The key is to be creative with your marketing efforts and find a way to reach your best customers.\nWhether you plan to launch a clothing boutique or grow the one you already have, you need to be online. The U.S. apparel industry is expected to reach $285 billion by 2025. Online sales account for over 27 percent of its total revenue. Therefore, it makes sense to focus your efforts on building a strong online presence for your boutique.\nHowever, this doesn't mean that brick-and-mortar stores are obsolete. In fact, two-thirds of customers visit retail stores before or after making online purchases. They want to see and feel the products they're interested in and try them on before buying.\nWith these things in mind, create a website or blog for your clothing boutique. Consider selling both online and in-store. For example, you can give local customers the option to order their favorite products online through your website and try them in store. Also, take the time to promote your boutique on social media and local business directories.\nWhen it comes to retail, location is everything. If your store is located in an obscure neighborhood, customers might not be able to find it.\nIdeally, choose a central location or a popular area so you can get more foot traffic to your clothing boutique. You'll pay more in rent, but it's well worth it \u2013 your profits will soar and your store will gain exposure.\nNo matter how big or small your store is, you need a solid business plan. Think of it as a roadmap that will guide your efforts in the right direction. Furthermore, you can use it to define and measure your goals, set milestones and stay organized.\nFocus on the most important points in your business plan. These may include your value proposition, financial projections, market research, business objectives and more. Determine who your target customers are and how to reach them, set short- and long-term goals and define your marketing strategies. Analyze your competitors\u2019 strengths and weaknesses as well.\nThe most popular brands employ entire teams to manage their social-media presence \u2013 and for good reason. More than 40 percent of customers research new brands and products on social networks. Even if you don't plan to sell online, use Pinterest, Instagram and Facebook to engage with your prospects and existing buyers.\nUse social-media marketing to expand your reach and tell your story. Share behind-the-scenes photos, talk about your latest products and let customers know what your team is up to. Leverage the power of influencer marketing to boost your exposure and increase brand awareness.\nLet's say you're selling fitness apparel. Connect with local athletes, personal trainers and fitness models. Let them know about your clothing boutique and offer them special discounts or free stuff. You can even set up an affiliate program for influencers and gym enthusiasts who actively promote your products.\nWord of mouth is your best marketing tool. Customers who love your products and services will be more than happy to spread the word about your brand. Reward them with freebies and discounts for sending you referrals and leaving online reviews.\nKeep your regular clients up to date with your latest products via email.

Cigarette butts never biodegrade and are frequently found during river and beach cleanup events. Washed through storm drains into streams, bays and oceans, they poison wildlife.\nMeanwhile, San Francisco spent $7 million annually to remove cigarette butts from streets and sidewalks. Studies show increasing the price of cigarettes by 30 percent could reduce consumption by 7.5 percent, which would reduce litter.

Ever since the 1980s, when copies of deleted White House emails from John Poindexter and Oliver North became public and showed their role in the Iran-Contra affair, people have known that email lives forever.\nWhat is not clear is how someone as knowledgeable as Powell didn\u2019t remember those lessons. His actions reinforce the old adage that \u201cone should never put anything in an email that you would not want to be on the front page of a newspaper.\u201d Hopefully, this is an experience that we all can learn from.\nRe \u201cArea median income level highest in years\u201d (Page 1B, Sept. 15): A new U.S. census report shows the most positive economic news in years for California and the entire country. Household incomes and job growth are up, and the poverty rate is down. The number of Americans without health insurance is the lowest ever.\nThis is mainly the result of the 2009 stimulus launched by President Barack Obama. And yet House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a speech last week proclaiming Obama\u2019s policies and presidency a complete failure. The good speaker now has egg on his face. While our president works hard to make our lives better, the Republicans focus mainly on undermining his efforts. The choice for voters in November is clear.\nRe \u201cBrown vetoes legal aid for military\u201d (Page 7A, Sept. 15): I wasn\u2019t aware that Gov. Jerry Brown was concerned about spending too much of our taxes. He vetoed a bill to aid military personnel with legal assistance in this state. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind spending $40 billion for tunnels to divert water to SoCal. Or $60 billion for a train to nowhere. Or money for illegal immigrants to get a college education, housing and food. Gov. Brown would be better off having a legacy assisting military veterans, in my opinion."}

It\u2019s an understandable reaction to the negative publicity brought on by the disproportionate number of marquee male golfers dropping out of Rio compared to athletes in other sports.\nIt\u2019s also an alternative that would never have worked. Olympic officials added golf to the Games under the contingency that the world\u2019s best players (read: best pros) would be competing. Anything else, and the sport would still be on the outside looking in. Meanwhile, the long-term goal of inspiring growth of the sport in areas of the world where it has yet to take off would be far more difficult to accomplish if the best players in the game (read: best pros) aren\u2019t the ones doing the inspiring.\nYou are still in luck, however, if you are looking for amateur golfers to compete in the Olympics. The current system allows for amateurs to qualify so long as they earn points in pro events so as to be listed on the Official World Golf Ranking or the Rolex Rankings. When the July 11 deadline passes to lock in qualifiers, a pair of female amateur golfers\u2014Ireland\u2019s Leona Maguire and Switzerland\u2019s Albane Valenzuela\u2014are likely to have earned a spot on their country\u2019s respective women\u2019s teams.\nLeona Maguire looks to be the lone representative in the women's Olympic competition from the Republic of Ireland.\nMaguire, 21, is a rising junior at Duke and was ranked as the No. 1 amateur in the world from May 2015 to May 2016 (she\u2019s currently No. 2). She was the college player of the year in 2015 and has played as an amateur in a handful of Ladies European Tour events (finishing second in the 2015 ISPS Handa Ladies European Masters) and three women\u2019s professional majors.\nMaguire played on the victorious Great Britain & Ireland Curtis Cup team last month and is competing this week in the U.S. Women\u2019s Open at CordeValle. Amazingly, she is currently the only player from Ireland inside the top 60 of the Olympic Ranking, meaning she could be the country\u2019s only female golfer competing in Rio.\nAfter tieing for low-amateur honors at the ANA Inspiration, Albane Valenzuela started thinking about the possibility of qualifying for the Olympics from Switzerland.\nValenzuela, 18, is 11th on the World Amateur Ranking. In March, she played in her first women\u2019s professional major, the ANA Inspiration, where she shared low-amateur honors when she finished T-65. The resulting rankings points made qualifying for the Olympics become a more realistic goal, so she sought sponsor\u2019s exemptions into subsequent Ladies European Tour events. A T-5 showing at the Lalla Mayern Cup in Morocco, followed by a T-4 at the Tipsport Golf Masters in the Czech Republic moved her inside the top 60 of the Olympic Ranking.\nValenzuela, who\u2019ll start college at Stanford this fall, is playing at the Women\u2019s Open as well, and if she were to make the cut she would seemingly lock up one of the two Swiss spots.\n\u201cIt would be such an honor to play for Switzerland and be in the Olympic Village,\u201d Valenzuela said."}

The Labour landslide in 1945 was the party's biggest victory until Tony Blair entered Downing Street in 1997.\nAfter 14 years of Tory rule and six long years of war, millions of ordinary people were desperate for change, which is why Attlee's slogan, 'Let us Face the Future', struck such a chord.\nAnd, as Tory seats continued to fall, Labour supporters roared themselves hoarse at their victory party in Central Hall - an uncanny preview of Blair's Things Can Only Get Better celebrations five decades later.\nIt was a remark that would come back to haunt him.

But as Cash's denials mounted, some alternative facts were brewing.\nJust before the dinner break, BuzzFeed News published a story saying it had spoken to journalists who claimed they had received a call from Cash's office an hour before the raids. After checking back with her office, Cash was forced to concede one of her advisers had in fact contacted the media \"without my knowledge\".\nThe staffer in question quit immediately and as of Thursday evening, Labor was doing its very best to pressure Cash to resign.\nApart from the political fallout, BuzzFeed's story has also sparked questions about the relationships between journalists and politicians. Are they too cosy? Or is \"off-the-record\" a sacred beast that should never be sacrificed?\nWhile many have praised the Cash staffer scoop - including Canberra press gallery doyenne, Michelle Grattan - BuzzFeed reporter Alice Workman says she's been approached by several colleagues from other outlets, unhappy at her decision to out Cash's office. They say there are certain conventions between the warring sides of journalists and MPs. Revealing a minister's office was behind the news tip could ruin relationships for everyone.\nThere is also concern that off-the-record should always stay that way (even though Canberra has an intermittent history of breaking that rule: think Barrie Cassidy revealing Kevin Rudd was campaigning to return, when he insisted he wasn't). On Wednesday, Daily Telegraph national political editor Sharri Markson tweeted it had been a \"shocking night for the media. Some journos clearly do not know how to protect sources\".\nWorkman of course didn't directly \"out\" any sources herself. She says she was approached by (unnamed) journalists on Wednesday \u2013 who had been contacted by Cash's office \u2013 as it became clear the minister was misleading the Senate (whether inadvertently or not).\n\"We have a responsibility to call [those in power] out,\" Workman says.\nThe BuzzFeed reporter explains the specific outlets were not identified in her story because those in question feared losing their jobs.\nArguably, the trickier question is whether those who spoke to Workman should have kept their interactions with Cash's office a secret in the first place.\nMarcus Strom, a former Fairfax journalist and president of the media arm of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, says as a general principle, once journalists accept a confidence it should be respected. But he cautions that the default position of journalists should be to explain to audiences where information is coming from. And he wonders whether we are drifting into a culture where too much information is taken \"off-the-record\".\nThis is a daily balancing act in the press gallery. Journalists need to speak to sources (mostly politicians, their staffers, public servants and lobbyists) off-the-record or \"on background\" so they can gather as much information as possible. If they only used on-the-record comments, they would only get the boring, sanitised version of events.\nSean Kelly, a former adviser to Rudd and Julia Gillard, says for politicians and their staff, off-the-record briefings can be incredibly important to make sure journalists properly understand the facts and context of an issue.\nIn the case of news tips \u2013 about say, a photo opportunity or a police raid \u2013"}

Each agency sets rates and collects tolls for its portion.\nThe increase is part of an annual adjustment for operation and maintenance costs, said John Standiford, deputy executive director of the Riverside County Transportation Commission.\nSeparate from that, the transportation commission has adjusted rates on the eight-mile Riverside County segment several times since the lanes opened. Toll lane operators are trying to determine the best rate that will let traffic flow with little congestion.\nDrivers along the 91 Express Lakes will see another rate increase on July 1.\nStandiford said transportation officials expected an initial six-month period in which rates would be monitored and changed based on traffic numbers. Overall, the agency is seeing solid usage and growth in the toll lanes, he said.\nOrange County typically adjusts its rates only on a quarterly basis and Riverside County hopes to do the same soon, Standiford said.\nRight now, during the heaviest commute time \u2014 Friday afternoon for drivers returning east from Orange County \u2014 the highest price for using the lanes through Riverside and Orange counties is $20.85 around 3 p.m.\nAfter the increase, the price will be $21.05 for that same commute.

He was searching for a groom for his daughter and some relatives brought a man to see his daughter on January 19. Ashwini noticed that the entire family was busy preparing for the meet and decamped with 138 grams of gold ornaments and a cellphone belonging to Rajeev\u2019s daughter.\nRajev came to know about the phone missing the same day. The next day, he found that gold too had been stolen but the family was clueless about the thief.\nRajeev\u2019s daughter, however, learnt that the profile picture of her Facebook account had been changed and the new one was that of a five-year-old girl. She alerted her father, who later found the child was Ashwini\u2019s daughter. He asked Ashwini to return the phone and ornaments, but she feigned innocence.

But retirement is still a fairly new concept in the context of American history. That's what Morgan Housel told Matt Trogdon in the most recent edition of Out On a Limb. Retirement has only become prominent in the American psyche in the last 50 or 60 years, said Housel.\nAs the concept of retirement spread, the idea of early retirement followed. Now, early retirement is a goal shared by millions of Americans, though few of them are certain how to achieve it. So Housel and Trogdon considered the question of how much someone might need in order to retire early.\n\"What it gets into is how much money do you need to have a perpetual income that you can rely on ... into perpetuity without ever draining it down,\" Housel said.\nHistorically, Housel noted, the safe withdrawal rate from a balanced portfolio has been 4% a year. If that number held, an investor with $1 million saved up would be able to withdraw $40,000 per year without whittling down their portfolio principle. Given today's low interest rates, Housel warned that 3% might be a safer withdrawal number.\nClick play on the video below for more of the discussion."}

It was a bone-chilling overcast day, and the movement in the window was as apropos as it was unnerving. Kuehn walked straight toward it, as if called to the creepiness.\nKuehn makes it his business to notice the rustle of fabric when there should be none, to hear a faint voice on an airwave, to make out a blurry shape in the background of a photograph. Such otherworldly encounters are the basis for his art.\nIn paintings and installations, Kuehn chronicles paranormal activity in Minnesota. Traveling around the state to sites of legend and lore, he culls inspiration from the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior, from tales of a haunted train trestle in the Minnesota River Valley, and from eyewitness accounts of Sasquatch footprints on a rural road in the North Woods.\nHis depictions aren't literal. They can't be. Kuehn has never seen a ghost.\nWhat he portrays are the stories of others, having never seen evidence of a haunting with his own two eyes.\nA spooky figure is the subject of the oil painting \u201cWendigo\u201d by Kuehn.\n\"I've heard that with different people, you're either sensitive or you're not, like you're tall or you're not; you're redheaded or you're not,\" Kuehn said. \"I haven't been able to fake it.\"\nInstead, he captures the mood he finds at these places. His works exude an eerie drama that, much like any paranormal sighting, leaves interpretation to the eye of the beholder. A white light around a figure, an oddly arranged pile of rocks, a lens flare captured in a photograph \u2014 all become the focal points in his paintings and sculptures.\nOther pieces utilize ghost-hunting equipment: a field of laser beams that would dim if an invisible figure passed through it, a radio that incessantly sweeps through airwaves searching for the conversations with the other side. Those audio and visual contraptions were on display at a recent exhibition of his work at the Soap Factory in Minneapolis.\nBut Kuehn has never seen those laser lights flicker. He's never caught a voice on the radio that shouldn't have been there.\nAnd the flutter in the mental hospital building?\n\"It's just drapes in an open window,\" he said as he got closer, sounding slightly deflated.\nKuehn, 40, was always fascinated by tales of ghosts, starting with one very big one, the Holy Ghost, he said.\nHe grew up in western Wisconsin, where he was a Catholic altar boy. \"I got really into the candles and incense and the more mystical parts of a mass,\" he said.

Although those years have likely dimmed the memory of our family, they have not altered ours of you, or the week that our daughter Kelly spent on your service.\nI will quickly recap the events of Feb 29, 2004. Our family had skied the day before at Dodge Ridge, and Kelly, who was six years old, suffered a left basal ganglia ischemic stroke while sledding on the 29th. I only mention the day before because it was a topic of great debate regarding whether hers was a traumatic or atraumatic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). At the end of that very long day, Kelly was admitted to the separate glassed-in area of your PICU where she stayed for six days. Although no definitive etiology was ever obtained, the best theory was (and remains) a left ICA dissection.\nI have been thinking about the events of that day and that week, as I do each year at this time, and about all that has transpired in the many years since, and, of course, you came to mind. I thought I might write you a message to thank you again, and to update you on Kelly\u2019s life in the intervening years. First and foremost, thank you so much again for being the voice of calm and reason during our stay there, and for obviously caring for Kelly as much as if she had been your own daughter because that was plain for everyone to see. A teaching hospital is a wonderful place for a gravely sick child, but it comes at a price, namely a gaggle of young residents all looking to impress the parents of their patients with how brilliant they think themselves to be, and to influence the course of treatment whenever possible. Such was the case there, but I still view that price as negligible compared to the care and compassion Kelly received during her stay. After one day there, it was clear that we needed a single point of contact to coordinate her treatment, and I asked that you be that for our family, and you did that to perfection.\nI don\u2019t think you could know the stress you kept us from, as we were already quite overloaded simply with accepting what had happened to Kelly, and you were a marvelous and calm buffer between us and all of those unnecessary distractions. A perfect example of this was the great debate regarding whether Kelly should be put on ASA or Coumadin. There were as many opinions as there were physicians who felt compelled to share them, and you were the only one to tell us that there really was simply not enough data \u2013 you had searched for three hours that day, and come up short on sufficient literature. Your opinion was that Coumadin was the most conservative route (which we agreed with), and Kelly spent the next six months on it without incident. She continues today on a daily baby aspirin, and will for the rest of her life.\nWe left UC Davis Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s PICU to be closer to home in San Jose, and Kelly spent the next three weeks in the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center because there was a physiatrist there we wanted her to work with. It was a very busy time \u2013 Kelly received physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy daily for those three weeks, and she continued that after her discharge for about a year, after which she continued with PT alone.

The Lower East Side space opened in 2014, partnering with celebrity trainer Justin Gelband, who curates the $40 a class workouts in the 1,500 square foot space.\nIn addition to modelFit, Packer also founded the lifestyle site bonberi, a curated guide to food, fitness and well-being.\n\u201cMy dear friend and co-founder Nicole Berrie and I traveled to Ibiza together, and while the rest of our group was on the party circuit, she and I were seeking out the best juice bars, doing Bikram yoga at the local studio, going on runs together, and seeking out the healthiest balance we could manage while also enjoying all that Ibiza has to offer,\u201d Packer said.\n\u201cWhen we returned home, we decided to create a site that showcased the world of wellness, but not from a dogmatic or extreme point of view, more from the ethos that true health comes from balance, and we present all the different ways in which to do that. We are very inspired by the people we interview, and we are always creating new recipes and testing out new restaurants. We especially love creating our travel guides, where we seek out the best of health in different cities here and countries abroad,\u201d Packer said.\nPacker feels that being a millennial has inspired her as a business woman the rapidly evolving wellness space.\n\u201cThe opportunity is there. People are excited about start up businesses that break the mold of tradition. They want to support that growth and change. It's very much the time of the entrepreneur, or even the renaissance person. People have such a range of interests and they want to find ways to express themselves creatively in all of them. It's exciting, there is a dynamic element to the way people are working together and finding ways to support one another and promote what they are doing,\u201d Packer said.\n\u201cSocial media plays a huge role as well. It transforms a boutique fitness studio on Bowery to a global brand, and puts us in touch with people all around the world. I'm humbled and inspired by my peers, and the health, wellness and fitness community as a whole. It excites me that people are interested in taking better care of themselves, and investing in their health. I'm proud to service that need and desire with what I do at modelFIT and bonberi,\" Packer continued.\nPacker is looking forward to continuing to grow both her brands both online and offline, with lessons she has learned in the past few years.\n\u201cRunning a business is all about maintenance, especially with a physical space. It's a living, breathing thing that needs to be nurtured and cared for; there is no autopilot. Hiring people that understand and believe in what you are doing, and get behind the brand to be a part of the movement is the most valuable asset in running and expanding a business. Asking for help is something I've learned, but it's a daily practice. The power of community is something deep-down I knew was important, but what I've learned is how vital it is. Having support from those around you, and surrounding yourself with likeminded people has made all the difference in my career.

Being a woman in that age range, I've taken it to heart, so to speak, and keep returning to the American Heart Association (AHA) website to browse prevention articles \u2013 especially since the rise in women's heart attacks was largely associated with modifiable risk factors. That is, they could have been potentially prevented by addressing things like high blood pressure, smoking, weight, physical activity, et cetera.\nFor each hour of regular exercise you get, you gain about two hours of additional life.\nUpon reading that, I immediately started doing the math and figured out that I could live until about 193, yay! OK, not really. I don't know how they calculated this and there are obviously parameters, otherwise we'd see all kinds of nonagenarians out there putting in an hour to gain another.\nBut even so \u2013 regular activity is crucial and has all kinds of benefits. Among other things, a lack of physical activity can lead to blood clots, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke and other heart related problems. All of which leads to shorter lives, more expenses, and wasted resources.\n\"On the other hand,\" according to the AHA, \"becoming more active can lower your blood pressure by as much as 4 to 9 mm Hg, which is the same reduction in blood pressure you\u2019d get by anti-hypertensive medications. Physical activity can also boost your levels of good cholesterol.\"\nGiven that heart attack is the number one killer of women in this country \u2013 and regular moderate to vigorous activity can reduce heart disease by 30 to 40 percent and stroke by 25 percent \u2013 it seems kind of hard to ignore. And that's not even mentioning all the other benefits of exercise, like everything from more energy and better mood to less stress and insomnia.\nA good goal is to aim for 30 minutes a day. And any activity counts; think brisk walking, housework, gardening, bicycling, taking the stairs instead of the escalator.\nSo if you come from the camp of \"life's too short to exercise,\" just know that with that 200 percent return on your investment, life may be too short not to exercise. As for me, I'm putting down the lemon curd and going out for a run.\nWhy are young women having more heart attacks?"}

{"idx": "31382", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Fixing the aging, often overworked systems that treat municipal wastewater in South Dakota would cost nearly $160 million, a cost borne mostly by state residents whose drinking water could be at stake.\nSystem upgrades are critical to improving the water quality in state rivers because pollution from aging systems could taint the drinking water supplies of some state residents.\nIn all, 98 South Dakota municipalities get drinking water from surface water sources, almost exclusively rivers. Seven municipalities have dedicated surface water systems and 91 buy their water from rural systems that use surface water as the source, according to Brian Walsh, spokesman for the state DENR. The Missouri River is the source for many of those drinking water systems.\nThe 20 biggest cities in South Dakota dump nearly 50 million gallons of treated sewage into state rivers each day, according to a News Watch analysis. Though most cities have upgraded their systems over the years, many were built decades ago. Mobridge, which dumps into the Missouri River, built its system in 1958, while Belle Fourche opened its system that dumps into a small creek in 1959. Rapid City built its system in 1967 and Sioux Falls opened its system in 1985, though both cities have done updates since then. The average age of the core elements of the systems in the largest 20 cities is 41.2 years.\nInspection and permit records reveal that older treatment systems often have trouble meeting pollution limits. The town of Sinai \u2014 a hamlet of about 120 people in southwestern Brookings County \u2013 had a mechanical treatment system built in 1979 that frequently violated wastewater standards. The city was cited for 176 violations of biological oxygen demand, acidity and total suspended solids released between 2008 and 2015, according to state inspection data. The system dumped 15,000 gallons of wastewater per day into Bolstad Slough.\nIn 2016, the state ordered the town to build a new system, and using local and state funds, a two-cell stabilization pond system was built for $1.5 million. Since then, discharges into the slough have stopped and no new effluent violations have been reported, according to the DENR.\nThe DENR said the State Water Plan, which guides project proposals and funding, includes 36 identified but unfunded wastewater projects of various types with a combined cost of $157 million.\nBuilding new systems or upgrading old ones puts pressure on local officials to make sound decisions and forge a balance between cost and water quality outcomes.\nOn occasion, high growth can dictate a change.\nDan Fink, maintenance superintendent for the city of Harrisburg, among the state\u2019s fastest-growing cities, said that community is in the midst of a debate over building a new wastewater system or continuing to pipe waste to the Sioux Falls Water Reclamation Facility for treatment. The decision comes amid resident complaints over occasional odors from the existing lagoon system.\n\u201cThis is a multi-million-dollar decision as to which would be better for the taxpayers,\u201d Fink said.\nAccording to the city\u2019s website, Harrisburg in 2015 was offered a long-term option to continue pumping waste to Sioux Falls at a cost of up to $30 million over 20 years. The price tag led the city to hire an engineering firm that created two options for a new system that would cost $15 million to $20 million."}

And maybe, just maybe, Clinton is finally willing to really play the game.\nPeel back the accumulated layers of wallpaper that make up Hillary Clinton\u2019s career, and the one at bottom is that of a political spouse who started out defending a talented and flawed husband. Hillary Clinton\u2019s political apprenticeship wasn\u2019t in the retail politics that Bill Clinton so loved; it was in crisis communications, which fit her temperament, acute lawyerly mind and her husband\u2019s penchant for getting into crises in the first place.\nIn the 1992 presidential race, she encouraged efforts to push back against press inquiries into Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities and her own financial dealings, and cooperated with a campaign-within-a-campaign in Little Rock, along with Betsey Wright, her husband\u2019s top aide, according to an account provided to journalist Carl Bernstein. The unit, known inside the Clinton campaign as the \u201cDefense Department,\u201d collected 2,000 boxes full of personal papers and correspondence and became a prototype of sorts for Clinton\u2019s fortress-like approach to press relations from then on.\nBut she wasn\u2019t just any staffer; she was Bill Clinton\u2019s wife, and their job, as Wright so memorably put it, was to stomp out the \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d before they could derail his presidential aspirations. No wonder the strain of her dual roles seemed, at times, unbearable. Sitting by her husband\u2019s side in the famous 60 Minutes interview in early 1992, she pleaded for boundaries in the coverage of her family: She was no Tammy Wynette, \u201cstandin\u2019 by my man,\u201d but still, it was nobody\u2019s business if she wanted to be. \u201cI think it\u2019s real dangerous in this country if we don\u2019t have some zone of privacy for everybody,\u201d she said, after the interrogation about whether Bill had in fact had an affair with former Arkansas TV reporter Gennifer Flowers.\nBill won, but no \u201czone of privacy\u201d materialized, and his first four years in the White House were a procession of disasters that included Whitewater, Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed health reform initiative and the suicide of her close friend and husband\u2019s deputy counsel, Vince Foster, who killed himself in July 1993 under withering scrutiny over allegations of impropriety in the White House travel office. At the time of his suicide, he had been working on a number of controversial legal issues in the White House, and Hillary Clinton viewed the hazing of her former law partner as part of a larger national press witch hunt against her family, friends and associates. \u201cI\u2019m sure that I sometimes appeared brittle, sad and even angry\u2014because I was,\u201d she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History, of her struggle to deal with Foster\u2019s death and the conspiracy theories it spawned.\nIf her overall attitude toward the prying press was immutably negative, Clinton reluctantly came to grips with the reality that she needed to connect with reasonable members of the media, establishing a pattern of grudging engagement followed by reflexive withdrawal.

Last week there were reports leaking out from NFL players that the owners of their franchises were telling them that the protests against racism and police brutality being staged during the anthem had to end. They were dropping the hammer, even though NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had promised that there would be no reprisals.\nHill even stated explicitly, \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear: I\u2019m not advocating a NFL boycott. But an unfair burden has been put on players in Dallas & Miami w/ anthem directives.\u201d Yet the news still read that she was suspended for advocating a boycott.

It\u2019s outrageous, and every ESPN employee, no matter their politics, should stand with Hill against efforts to silence her.\nThe question worth asking is \u201cWhy?\u201d Why is a tycoon like Jerry Jones, a person who buys people like Donald Trump, and a multibillion-dollar global media leviathan, so scared of this man? Trump is currently rocking a 32 percent approval rating and being openly mocked by members of his own party. The idiotic kabuki theater of Mike Pence walking out of a game was discredited in real time, to anger and derision. Ratings are down, but that\u2019s less Trump\u2019s influence than ongoing trends across all racial and ethnic groups. Poll numbers are shifting in the direction of the protesting players largely because people don\u2019t want to stand with the big orange baby. It\u2019s a clown show. So why are they afraid of this man?\nSports owners and ESPN/Disney CEOs aren\u2019t scared of Trump and his bathroom Twitter spasms. If anything, they are grateful for them. They don\u2019t fear his base. They share his politics. They want black NFL players to shut up and play. They want their sponsors to stay happy. They want the only politics of football to be the politics of Jerry Jones, not Colin Kaepernick, no matter how shameless, hypocritical, and craven it all looks.\nDonald Trump then becomes a useful cudgel to beat down any dissenting voices, from the workers on the NFL field to the journalists in the newsroom. These owners plowed millions of dollars into Donald Trump for a reason, and this is the return on their investment. Yet, as embittering as all of this is, it comes with a benefit: Now the lines are drawn more visibly. We know who is on which side, and what\u2019s needed is clear: Whether you are an NFL player, a fan, or a reporter for ESPN, everyone has an interest in standing up to this clumsy, thuggish effort to silence dissenting voices.\nWe are already seeing this from Philadelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins, who responded to Jerry Jones by saying that his fist would be remaining high in the air until change comes to this country, and no \u201cowner\u201d will tell him otherwise. Again, billionaires are not our friends, but solidarity is.

For his services he was awarded a commission in the British Army, a grant of the Magdalen Islands, 3,000 acres of land in New Hampshire, and a life annuity. When the break with the mother country came, he stood with the colonies and was made Chief Engineer in the New England Provincial Army. He laid out the defenses on Breed's Hill and was wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He was appointed Chief Engineer of the Continental Army after Washington took command in July 1775. He directed the construction of the fortifications which forced the British to evacuate Boston in March 1776. When Washington moved his Army south, Gridley remained as Chief Engineer of the New England Department. He retired in 1781 at age 70. He died June 21, 1796, in Stoughton, Massachusetts.\nRufus Putnam was born April 9, 1738, in Sutton, Massachusetts. A millwright by trade, his three years of Army service during the French and Indian War influenced him to study surveying and the art of war. After the Battle of Lexington, he was commissioned an officer of the line, but General Washington soon discovered his engineering abilities. He planned the fortifications on Dorchester Neck that convinced the British to abandon Boston. Washington then brought Putnam to New York as his Chief Engineer. He returned to infantry service in 1777, taking command of the 5th Massachusetts Regiment. He and his troops helped to fortify West Point, erecting strong defenses atop the steep hill that commanded that garrison. The remains of Fort Putnam, preserved by the Military Academy, still honor his name there. Putnam was named a brigadier general in the Continental Army in 1783. In 1788 he led the first settlers to found the present town of Marietta, Ohio. The fortifications that he built there saved the settlements from annihilation during the disastrous Indian wars. He became Surveyor General of federal public lands and judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio. He died in Marietta on May 1, 1824.\nOne of General Washington's most trusted military advisors, Louis Leb\u00e8gue Duportail was born near Orleans, France, in 1743. He graduated from the royal engineer school in M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, France, as a qualified engineer officer in 1765. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Royal Corps of Engineers, Duportail was secretly sent to America in March 1777 to serve in Washington's Army under an agreement between Benjamin Franklin and the government of King Louis XVI of France. He was appointed colonel and commander of all engineers in the Continental Army, July 1777; brigadier general, November 1777; commander, Corps of Engineers, May 1779; and major general (for meritorious service), November 1781. Duportail participated in fortifications planning from Boston to Charleston and helped Washington evolve the primarily defensive military strategy that wore down the British Army.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he wants to take legal action because Obama has abused his authority to carry out laws Congress approves, specifically by delaying a health care law requirement that many employers provide medical coverage for their workers.\nIn recent months, Republicans have attacked Obama for taking actions like having the Environmental Protection Agency curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and blocking the deportation of children illegally brought into the U.S. by their parents. GOP lawmakers say their lawsuit is simply an attempt to defend Congress' powers against a president who they say has made a habit of acting unilaterally to carry out his personal policy preferences.\n\"This is not a political issue. This is not an issue that should pit Republicans against Democrats,\" said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, the Rules Committee chairman.\n\"Any person interested in our Constitution and our brilliant system of separation of powers should be worried about what is currently happening in our country,\" Sessions said.\nDemocrats mocked the legal action as a purely political exercise that is doomed to failure but aimed at appeasing conservatives who want to see Obama impeached. The Rules committee's top Democrat, Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York, called it \"preposterous\" and noted that in effect Republicans are filing suit over a delay in a part of a law that every GOP lawmaker opposed and that the House has voted about 50 times to repeal or pare back.\n\"This is a partisan political stunt timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November, right as the midterm elections are happening,\" Slaughter said. \"The House majority is suing the president simply for doing his job.\"\nThe House is expected to vote on the resolution allowing the chamber to file a lawsuit before it leaves for its August recess.\nOn Wednesday, each party invited a pair of law professors to testify and defend their positions.\n\"You not only have a right but a deep obligation to protect\" Congress powers, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who was invited by Republicans to testify, told the committee. \"It is not a political question when this body goes to court and says the president has exceeded his authority.\"\nElizabeth Price Foley, a law professor at Florida International University, disputed Democratic claims that the lawsuit was invalid in the first place because Obama has not infringed on Congress' powers to pass laws. She said Republicans have \"an excellent chance\" of winning a dispute over the meaning of the constitutional provision that the president \"shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\nThat was countered by attorney Simon Lazarus"}

Scott Walker is reversing course on a key tax credit for the working poor, proposing to raise incomes for more than 130,000 state families by returning the more than $20 million a year he cut from the program in 2011.\nMADISON - Gov. Scott Walker is reversing course on a key tax credit for the working poor, proposing to raise incomes for more than 130,000 state families by returning the more than $20 million a year he cut from the program in 2011.\nThe Republican governor will unveil the proposal at the Wauwatosa Rotary Club Wednesday as part of a broader package in his budget bill that aims to strengthen families and marriage. The measure marks the changing priorities for Walker as he shifts from the budget cuts of his first term to his current goal of trying to draw Wisconsinites into the work force.\nAs part of the proposed increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit, the governor wants to make it more generous to parents with just one child and soften the credit's current penalty for married couples.\n\"Families are the foundation of our society,\" Walker said in a statement. \"While we are taking steps to make public assistance programs a trampoline, not a hammock, a second vital component to move children out of poverty is to ensure families and work are rewarded, not penalized.\"\nThe governor has already proposed broad changes to welfare programs, including requiring more food stamp recipients to work and undergo drug testing. Walker's latest proposal could mark a return by conservatives to a tax policy that they had once championed but often criticized in recent years.\nThe credit is meant to encourage low-wage employees for working by increasing their wages. Though 25% of the EITC decreases income taxes for low-wage workers, the majority of it goes to increase the income of workers who don't owe income taxes.\nIn 2011, Walker and GOP lawmakers cut the credit by a little more than $20 million a year to help solve a roughly $3 billion two-year budget shortfall.\nAt the time, Republicans said that the state's credit was unusually large for families with several children and objected to it largely going to people who owed no income taxes. Advocates for the needy said it was a tax increase on those who could least afford it.\nSince Walker called for cutting the credit in 2011, the state's budget has improved and the unemployment rate has dropped from 8.1% to 4% as of December, increasing the need for workers.\nSome Democrats are likely to argue this move is a flip-flop for Walker, but Jon Peacock, research director for the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said he welcomed the move.\n\"We are very pleased that the governor is restoring some of the funding that he cut from the Earned Income Tax Credit six years ago,\" Peacock said. \"This credit deserves strong bipartisan support because it has been shown by many studies to increase parents\u2019 participation in the work force and to boost children\u2019s health and educational achievement.\"\nThe proposal would take effect Jan. 1, 2018, for taxes filed in the spring of 2019 and would target low-income families with one child. Wisconsin's credit is among the highest in the nation for families with three or more children but among the lowest for parents with one child.\nUnder the proposed change, the average benefit for families with one child would more double to $248, up $158 from the current level of"}

Here are some to consider.\nFor those of you who received poinsettias or other flowering holiday plants, be sure that they are near a bright window and water as the top of soil becomes dry. Most holiday plants will last many years with proper care.\nThe most obvious January gardening activity is caring for houseplants. Remember that most of them prefer a humid, warm environment. Increase humidity around houseplants by grouping plants together, placing them on pebble-water trays, or running a humidifier. Houseplants typically do not need fertilized in the winter, but do water them as needed. Now is also a good time to repot those that have outgrown current pots.\nIf you plan to start seeds indoors this year for spring planting outside, begin gathering supplies. You\u2019ll need starting trays, lights, starting mix, and seeds.\nSeed catalogs are arriving in abundance. Read, dream, and make tentative selections. Order seeds and plants as early as possible for best selection and timely shipping. As you plan your garden, sketch it your plans on paper, including what to grow, spacing, arrangement, and number of plants needed. This will help as you develop a budget and spring shopping list.\nOn the next warm day, take some time to venture outside to inspect your gardens. Check young trees for rodent injury on lower trunks. Prevent injury with hardware cloth or protective collars, being sure to move them in the spring. During this winter of ice and snow, keep road and sidewalk salt away from desirable landscape plants. Construct a screen of burlap, if necessary, to keep salt spray off plants.\nWood ashes from the fireplace can be spread in the garden, but don\u2019t overdo it. Wood ahses increase soil pH, and excess application can make some nutrients unavailable for plant uptake. Have soil tested to be certain ofo the pH before adding wood ash.\nThese are a few of the January tips from our 2015 Garden Calendar, which provides garden tips for each month. I used information from University of Illinois and Purdue University sources and created lists that are appropriate for gardeners in the four counties that I serve: Fulton, Mason, Peoria, and Tazewell counties.\nThe calendar is available for as a free pdf-format download at http://web.extension.illinois.edu/fmpt.

These days, though, a 1941 Ford pickup and a 1939 Ford Deluxe sedan are parked in his garage bays. \u201cThese two Fords are the first vintage American cars I\u2019ve ever owned. One of the things I like about the two of them, and particularly about the \u201939, is the styling. This art deco, over-the-top styling; I think jt is so elegant,\u201d he said.\nJacobson has owned the Ford Deluxe for about five years. He discovered it while on a trip to California at Felder\u2019s Body Shop on the Pacific Coast Highway in Hermosa Beach. The business was opened by Mick Felder in 1968 and specializes in old vehicles. \u201cThis was his personal car. He owned it for nine years. They used it for advertisements for the shop. It was really not for sale, so we had to talk about it a little bit,\u201d Jacobson said.\nThe car has been tweaked substantially, handles well and has a pleasing throaty rumble. \u201cTo my ears it sounds like a vintage Chris Craft motorboat. It\u2019s a contemporary Chevrolet V8. Figure somewhere around 275-, 300-horsepower. I put a four-speed automatic transmission in it. The fourth gear gives it an overdrive, so, cruising on the road, this is fantastic. It\u2019s an infinitely beautiful driving car. It handles great,\u201d he said.\nJacobson said he has done a lot work on the sedan in the time he\u2019s owned it, and credited Felder for being upfront about its shortcomings. \u201cThere were a lot of things that were not quite right. The brakes weren\u2019t quite right. The suspension wasn\u2019t quite right. You can get a car up to a certain level pretty quickly but then to get it that last 20 percent takes a long, long time, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing the last five years,\u201d he said.\nBesides having suicide doors, the Ford Deluxe has numerous other neat features. There\u2019s a radio antenna above the windshield that can be extended by a knob inside above the windshield. The front windows slide backward before going down when the handles are cranked. It has a grill from a 1940 Ford and has been lowered and raked. Wide whitewall tires and red rims complete the look.\nIt appears unblemished and gives no hint that it was used in the construction of the rustic stone potting shed on Jeff Jacobson\u2019s property in Cornwall. Shining in the shade next to the small structure, the 1941 Ford pickup looks more suited to appearing in a wall calendar than for toting rocks, but Jacobson swears that it played a major role in the job.\nJacobson has owned the pickup for roughly 20 years. \u201cI needed something to haul stuff around and found this for sale up in Vermont,\u201d he recalled. It\u2019s powered by a flathead V-8 engine that Ford used between 1932 and 1955.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first mass-produced V-8 engine in the world. Henry"}

By linking this therapy to a patient\u2019s own heart rhythm, researchers believe it can be made more effective.\n\u201cMany of us have phobias of one kind or another \u2013 it could be spiders or clowns or even types of food,\u201d said Hugo Critchley, principal investigator of the study.\nA team from Brighton and Sussex Medical School had previously revealed how bodily arousal signals that occur with each individual heartbeat can change the emotional impact of potential threats; for example, when experienced during a heartbeat, they can appear greater.\nIn this latest trial, a computerised exposure therapy for spider phobia was combined with online measurements of heartbeats. One group was presented with pictures of spiders in time with their heartbeat, while another group was shown spider pictures in between heartbeats. A third group was then shown pictures of spiders at random.\nWhile a gradual reduction of fear was seen due to established exposure therapy results, study participants who were exposed to pictures in time with their heartbeats showed a greater reduction than the others. These improvements were also shown to depend on differences in how well an individual patient can accurately feel their own heart beating in their chest, suggesting a further way of tailoring the treatment to benefit each patient."}

These missing persons are being butchered, cooked, and served to unknowing patrons of the fine dining establishments popping up in the neighborhood, and The Dregs #1 does exceptional work capturing the horror of this practice and the paranoia that takes over the main character, Arnold, as he investigates the string of disappearances.\nWriters Lonnie Nadler and Zac Thompson have crafted a chilling Grand Guignol narrative rooted in major issues facing big cities, and the first issue of The Dregs puts readers deep in this environment as Arnold begins his search.

Eric Zawadzki\u2019s artwork with colorist Dee Cunniffe reinforces the sullen, gritty atmosphere that Arnold tries to escape through hallucinogenic drugs, and his change in perception after getting high is reflected in the linework and coloring. The buzz is killed when he discovers the empty lot that used to contain the building his missing friend lived in, introducing the first clue that sends Arnold down a path that could lead to his demise.

The fast-growing budget airline updated its second-quarter forecast after the market closed on Wednesday, and the news was good.\nSpirit Airlines is now in position to exceed analysts' most recent second-quarter earnings per share estimates by a country mile. Clearly, that's great news for investors. Nevertheless, the company needs to return to consistent unit revenue growth in the second half of 2018 to keep this rally going.\nIn late April, Spirit Airlines provided downbeat guidance for the second quarter, undermining a nascent rally for the stock. Management projected that revenue per available seat mile (RASM) would plunge 6.5% to 7.5%, while rising fuel prices would more than offset an impressive 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year improvement in non-fuel unit costs.\nBased on this forecast, analysts were recently projecting that Spirit's second-quarter adjusted EPS would fall to $0.92 from $1.14 a year earlier, despite the benefit of a lower tax rate.\nOn Wednesday evening, Spirit updated its second-quarter guidance. The company estimates that RASM fell 6.8% year over year, despite capacity growth coming in 1.5 percentage points higher than previously expected, at 30.5%. On the bright side, non-fuel unit costs plunged by about 11%. A shift in the timing of some expenses to the fourth quarter accounted for 1 percentage point of the improvement, but the rest reflected strong cost control.\nSpirit Airlines dramatically reduced its non-fuel unit costs last quarter. Image source: Spirit Airlines.\nFuel efficiency also improved significantly, as Spirit Airlines has been adding more fuel-efficient aircraft to its fleet. In fact, fuel consumption was 2.3% below Spirit's original forecast, despite capacity growth coming in higher than expected.\nIn total, fuel efficiency improved more than 5% year over year, from 85.3 available seat miles per gallon to 89.7 available seat miles per gallon. This was incredibly important, as fuel prices rose even more than expected last quarter.\nSpirit Airlines does not provide formal EPS guidance, but the company's forecasts include enough information to create good estimates. Spirit's capacity growth of 30.5%, offset by its 6.8% RASM decline, implies that total revenue rose approximately 21.6% last quarter to $853 million.\nMeanwhile, fuel consumption of 106.1 million gallons and an average price of $2.32 per gallon translate to total fuel costs of $246 million. The company disclosed net interest expense of $13.8 million. Lastly, Spirit's adjusted non-fuel operating expenses came in at $425 million in the second quarter of 2017. Based on a 30.5% capacity increase and an 11% decline in non-fuel unit costs, adjusted non-fuel operating expenses increased to around $494 million last quarter.\nTotaling up the numbers, Spirit's new forecast implies an adjusted profit of around $99 million before tax and $75 million after tax. That would imply EPS of $1.10: down just slightly year over year, and well ahead of analysts' current estimates.\nWhile investors' current excitement is understandable, it"}
{"idx": "31422", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Stop the presses! Pope Benedict XVI says he believes that Jesus Christ was a real person and that he died for our sins and that he was raised from the dead and is alive today! Oh, and he also believes hell is a real place and not some symbol intended to stir up Christians! This piece by Richard Owen of The Times does contain some genuine news, but the breathless headline \"Pope says hell and damnation are real and eternal\" lacks the all-important news hook.\nAddressing a parish gathering in a northern suburb of Rome, the Pope said that in the modern world many people, including some believers, had forgotten that if they failed to \"admit blame and promise to sin no more\", they risked \"eternal damnation -- the inferno\".\nHell \"really exists and is eternal, even if nobody talks about it much any more\".\nThe Pope, who as cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was head of Catholic doctrine, noted that \"forgiveness of sins\" for those who repented was a cornerstone of Christian belief.\nMy favorite part of this story is when Owen calls up the Pope's representatives at the Vatican for a clarification of his words. We're told that Benedict was \"speaking in 'straightforward' language 'like a parish priest.'\" The Pope also wanted to \"reinforce the new Catholic catechism,\" which says that hell should be understood physically rather than symbolically.\nPerhaps the news in this story is buried at the bottom?\nIn 1999 Pope John Paul II said heaven was \"neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but that fullness of communion with God, which is the goal of human life\".\nHell, by contrast, was \"the ultimate consequence of sin itself. Rather than a place, hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy\".\nIn October the Pope indicated that limbo, supposed since medieval times to be a \"halfway house\" between heaven and hell, was \"only a theological hypothesis\" and not a \"definitive truth of the faith\".\nSo rather than writing that the Pope believes that hell is a real place, tell us how this type of statement signifies a change in the Vatican's position on the afterlife. And what does this mean, since John Paul appointed him the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith?"}

Cannon and chats with Leffew's selectively supportive family members, the movie paints a clear picture of the polarizing, largely unsettled state of marriage equality.\nJaye's later segue, though, into such other LGBT-related topics as bullying, teen suicide and gay adoption laws, while all crucial issues, ends up diffusing the film's initial thrust.\nStill, if the movie makes even a few fence-sitters rethink the concept of family or the touchy conflation of marriage and religion, it will have achieved its goal.\n\"The Right to Love: An American Family.\" No MPAA rating.

{"idx": "31424", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: There is an awful lot of plot flying around in Revenge season two so far, yet everything still feels weirdly static. Perhaps it is because every episode so far has felt like it resets at the end, like all of the machinations are happening for machination's sake, independent of any necessary outcomes. This results in a confusing viewing experience, especially because, when all is said and done, a lot of the twists and turns feel superfluous, like the show is just killing time.\nNowhere does this feel more prevalent than the Victoria story, which has gone through so many twists and turns this season that even the craftiest of souls would have a hard time keeping up. The most important part is where it ends up, which also coincidentally is the best part: Victoria, forced into a corner by Emily\u2019s behind-the-scenes schemes, reveals to an army of reporters that Charlotte is the result of her affair with David Clark. But Victoria has more than just a simple confession up her sleeve, as her ultimate goal is to goad her unwitting family into presenting a united front in front of the world, even the hated Amanda Clark. What Victoria has up her sleeve following this proclamation is anyone\u2019s guess\u2014especially where it concerns Amanda\u2014but Emily might have come out positioned the best from this entire thing. Not only is Amanda now more of the Graysons\u2019 \u201cinner circle,\u201d but Daniel is now actively taking Emily\u2019s advice and working against Victoria while acting friendly to her face. This little bit of advice Emily gave Daniel was one of their best moments together, and one of the only times Emily has told Daniel the absolute truth. For the things that have been shaky this season, Revenge has done a great job of giving Emily and Daniel little interesting moments of connection in each episode.\nThe thing that is less clear is Victoria and Conrad\u2019s connection to Americon Initiative, the White-Haired Man, and Emily\u2019s mother. White-Hair (who gets a name in death, Gordon Murphy) was obviously carrying on some sort of relationship with Emily\u2019s mother, who is hiding out at the same hotel he was staying. If this is so, why did he try to kill Emily last week? And seeing that Americon sent Conrad a nasty message about Victoria\u2019s decision to out one of their henchmen as the suspect in her kidnapping, White-Hair was obviously still working for Americon.\nGranted, the mystery of this is the point but the level of complication here has gone beyond the point of \u201cfun mystery\u201d and to the point of \u201cimpenetrable mystery,\u201d which is especially concerning considering we are only three episodes into the season. The purpose of this criticism is not to completely dismiss the twisty, gloriously double-crossing nature of Revenge itself, as that is truly the show\u2019s bread and butter and can result in some of its greatest pleasures when executed well. It just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s being executed all that well, especially in the early going.\nOne thing that is adding to the complication in a somewhat more pleasant manner is Revenge Colleague Aiden and his backstory with Emily. Last season Emily was almost a revenge robot, and her time with Takeda was presented as an emotionless revenge programming. To learn that she had emotions, but they were trampled out of her by Aiden\u2019s rejection is a nice little shading on the character, especially since that emotional nature has slowly been rising to the surface as she develops relationships in the Hamptons. It helps that Aiden himself has a compelling presence, and his resourcefulness could be useful to Emily.\nOf Emily\u2019s relationships, the one that\u2019s increasingly important this season is Nolan, and they"}

Jerry Brown and his puppet leading the California High-Speed Rail Authority board, Dan Richard, have overstepped their legal authority and disregarded the will of the voters by pushing ahead full-throttle.\nJudge Michael Kenny had ruled in August that the authority \u201cabused its discretion\u201d by failing to secure funds and complete environmental reviews before authorizing expenditures.\nThis week, he sent the project back to the start by blocking the authority from implementing its 2011 spending plan and refusing to provide necessary legal blessing to the misguided issuance of $8.6 billion of construction bonds.\nBy any reasonable interpretation, this should put an end to Brown and Richard\u2019s bait-and-switch. But, when it comes to high-speed rail, those two aren\u2019t reasonable.\nIn a statement issued after the ruling, Richard tried to deceptively spin what the judge had said. True, as Richard notes, the judge did not stop the project. Rather he left it with no funding plan and the inability to borrow money.\nUntil the feds start to realize they\u2019ve been had, there\u2019s still a bit of money left from Washington. But it won\u2019t last long. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the project can continue to move forward.\nIt\u2019s time to put an end to this fraud.\nVoters were promised a system from San Diego to Sacramento at a cost of $45 billion. Today, the price is at least $69 billion, but would link only San Francisco with Los Angeles.\nAnticipated ticket prices have increased more than 50 percent, ridership projections have been cut by more than half, the opening date has been pushed back nine years to 2029, and the two-hour-and-40-minute mandated travel time from San Francisco to Los Angeles remains doubtful.\nThe authority has never fulfilled its promise to line up private-sector money. And critical federal funding would require an entirely different political environment in Washington.\nWithout a valid funding plan, and without the ability to issue bonds protected from legal challenge, California\u2019s high-speed rail project is effectively dead.\nIf Brown and Richard had one iota of intellectual honesty about the bullet-train promises, if they had any respect for the voters, they would either abandon the project or ask voters to approve a smaller, but more costly, one.\nThey know that\u2019s all the authority can deliver. But they also know voters, if asked, would reject that."}

{"idx": "31428", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If public services are going to survive cuts over the coming years they need to make fundamental changes to how they communicate.\nDebates about trust and confidence in institutions continue on a regular basis. If the media are to be believed people have lost faith in public services. But is this an accurate representation? It doesn\u2019t appear to be borne out in survey results. If you take policing as an example the surveys don\u2019t support the media headlines about a collapse in trust; the majority polled still have confidence in police officers according to a Sky News poll.\nMaintaining public confidence during an increasingly challenging financial situation is not going to be easy for public services. Recent announcements have suggested funding will be reduced in the coming years and this means services stretched or reduced. The impact will only really be felt when people call for assistance and find the services are not there.\nCommunication in all its forms will be vital in the lean years ahead. Whether it is by providing access to big data or finding other ways to release more information to people, communication will have to change. Frontline staff are going to be critical in maintaining confidence as services shrink. They are at the sharp end representing the organisation and what it stands for. Internal comms must now be prioritised. Staff need to be given the tools, training and support to manage communication, but they first have to understand why and be willing to do it. We can put the tools of modern communication into the hands of frontline staff. We must do it and do it now.\nPublic sector agencies are also going to have to work closer together. It is more than having a passing reference to \u2018partnership working\u2019 in a press release; it has to mean fundamentally changing how services are provided. For in-house communicators this creates challenges of focusing on the consumer rather than on protecting an organisation\u2019s reputation.\nWe need to move into a new era, where we are sharing between agencies and working in a more open way. It is a time when what matters to the consumer will override internal politics and egos. It is also a time when people need to take some control of their own communities. We are seeing some of this happen, with some local authority services now provided by community groups and charities. Within Greater Manchester Police we have been using community reporters who spend time with officers and write about their experiences.\nThe conversation with people will have to change. But at a time of increased scrutiny of decision-making by agencies, both by inspection regimes and by the media, this is going to be a leap of faith. No public sector chief executive will want to take this step into the brave new world and find they are pilloried in the newspapers when something goes wrong.\nIn almost five years of shrinking budgets, confidence has been maintained in much of the public sector. It now needs all public sector communicators to be strong and resilient, to take up the challenge and keep local people at the centre of the changes. Now we can shape the future for the better."}

The clause gives the U.S. president the power to impose tariffs on just about any foreign product if the White House deems they would \"threaten to impair the national security.\"\nCanada and Mexico are poised to lose their exemptions to those tariffs in less than a week unless a new deal can be reached by June 1.\nA person familiar with the discussions said the president has suggested seeking new tariffs of 20 to 25 per cent on automobile imports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak about private deliberations.\nAutoworkers union Unifor said it welcomed the new NAFTA negotiations as a chance to discuss critical issues in the industry, but it doesn't like how the White House is using section 232 as a \"blunt trade weapon.\"\n\"As a trusted trading partner, I think it's clear that Canada is not a threat to American security,\" Unifor national president Jerry Dias said in a news release. \"What's unclear is the motivation or the actual target of potential tariffs,\" Dias said, suggesting the White House is trying to use \"section 232 as a political tool to deliver one of [Trump's] so-called wins in the absence of a new NAFTA prior to the U.S. midterm elections.\"\nScotiabank economist Derek Holt said the tariff threat is yet another sign of instability in the global economy, created by an administration that seems bent on tearing up the old rules.\n\"This is the behaviour of a volatile, personality-led emerging market, not a first world nation, let alone a superpower,\" Holt said. \"As if we were not already there, one has to very fundamentally doubt the stability of the U.S. as a partner in global commerce and the value of its signatures on international agreements ranging from the WTO to NAFTA to the Paris accord and the TPP, among others.\"\nThe move is the latest salvo in Trump's escalating trade war against foreign powers who he insists are taking advantage of trade deals and treating the U.S. unfairly.\n\"Mexico has been very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with,\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\"But I will tell you that in the end we win,\" he said of ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations. \"We will win, and we'll win big.\"\nAt the time, Trump hinted at some big news to come for the U.S. auto sector that would make workers \"very happy.\"\nThere will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!\nHours later, the tariff plan was floated.\nNegotiations on the auto industry have reportedly been a major sticking point in NAFTA talks, as U.S. negotiators have pitched a very rigid definition of what is an American made car.

{"idx": "31442", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Trump administration officials are considering a plan to remain part of the nearly 200-nation Paris climate change agreement, while weakening former President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, multiple sources told POLITICO.\nThe plan has not yet won the buy-in of key Trump aides and the president has not signed off. Sources familiar with the plan cautioned that it remains in flux, and could be scuttled by Trump advisers who are critical of the agreement.\nBut keeping the U.S. in the 2015 Paris pact would be a victory for some in the Trump administration, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have sought to boost the president's green credentials and fear that pulling out would damage relations with key U.S. allies. Many conservatives have been pushing President Donald Trump to withdraw from the deal altogether, as the president himself pledged to do during the campaign.\nOne way to square those conflicting imperatives would be to reject the pledge Obama offered as part of the 2015 Paris pact \u2014 a nonbinding target for reducing the United States\u2019 emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s increasingly seen within the White House as a possible way forward.\nObama had pledged that by 2025 the U.S. would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below where it was in 2005.\nWeakening Obama's pledge would probably frustrate many American allies, who see the United States' commitment to tackling climate change as a bedrock of the Paris agreement. It would also reflect the likelihood that Trump's push to revoke key Obama environmental regulations would make it more difficult to meet the existing target.\nGeorge David Banks, a White House senior adviser on international energy and environmental issues, has briefed people outside the administration on the plan in recent days, according to people who have spoken with him.\nBanks discussed the plan during a Thursday meeting with about a dozen fossil fuel industry officials, according to people familiar with the closed-door discussion.\nBanks did not respond to a request for comment. A White House spokeswoman said, \"We have no announcements to make at this time.\"\nIt's unclear when the Trump administration will announce a final decision on its approach to Paris. Sources cautioned a verdict may not be made public for weeks or even months, and could hinge on broader energy-related discussions with other countries.\nIvanka Trump and Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, have been strong advocates of staying in the agreement, sources said. And other advisers raised fears that withdrawing altogether would greatly damage U.S. diplomatic relations with other countries.\nTrump\u2019s appointees are separately taking steps to revoke regulations requiring cuts in greenhouse gas pollution from the nation's power plants, among other rollbacks of Obama-era environmental rules.\nThose regulations were the bulwark of Obama\u2019s promise that the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest carbon polluter, would do its share to address the problem \u2014 even though scientists have said steeper cuts are needed to avoid catastrophic harm from climate change.\nTrump\u2019s advisers have sometimes been at odds over how to approach Paris \u2014 and Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is said to be advocating for withdrawing from the agreement.

{"idx": "31444", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A former Microsoft executive seems to imply the idea.\nHas Apple truly lost its way with Tim Cook at the helm?\nA former Microsoft executive has made this claim. Writing a guest piece for Forbes, former Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold at Microsoft -- from 1994 to 2001 -- believes that the iPad and iPhone maker simply hasn't been the same since the former CEO was in control.\nHerbold argues that while Apple stock continues to lose its glitter in the eyes of investors, data and numbers only tell us half the story. Stock prices, he argues, are not based solely on product line success or the balance sheet, but also relate to the perceived future of a company -- and in order to keep shareholders interested, the belief that a firm has innovative and visionary leadership is a crucial component.\nWhile the late Steve Jobs is called the \"ultimate visionary leader,\" Tim Cook, who replaced Jobs after the co-founder passed away in 2011, is implied to be nothing more than an office body. Although Cook is not mentioned by name, Herbold claims that Apple requires \"a visionary leader, not an administrator.\"\n\"The leader needs to be paranoid about making the core offerings of the organization more exciting and more impactful with its customers,\" Herbold writes. \"That sounds simple, but doing it with clarity and speed is absolutely necessary. You must avoid any kind of bureaucracy that can water down the impact of your efforts or slow it to a snail's pace.\"\nIn addition, Herbold says that in order to be the type of \"visionary\" leader modern-day businesses require, the CEO doesn't have to be a technology genius, but does have to have a high business acumen. Powerful, long-reaching business strategies are necessary, and deep, personal involvement with the details of your corporation is a must.\nComparing former IBM CEO Lou Gerstner and Steve Jobs, the former Microsoft exec says that the time spent getting to know your customers, their opinions and their needs, can improve the success of your products. Gerstner spent three months simply talking to customers about their information-technology challenges and based IBM's strategy on this, whereas Jobs personally led the design and development of Apple's consumer products -- and perhaps Cook has fallen short of this expectation.\nAs a parting shot, Herbold says that business managers must have \"the guts to lead\" to keep a firm competitive. It isn't about having charisma, but being strong-willed and knowing what you want to accomplish in the long-run.\n\"Apple could surprise us in the next six to nine months by emerging with yet another big new idea. On the other hand, I think the stock market is telling us that the public is beginning to believe that Apple really doesn't have strong visionary leadership. Apple will be a solid technology company but the Apple era may be on its way out.\""}

(AP) -- After the first two playoff holes, neither Kenny Perry nor Charley Hoffman looked capable of winning the FBR Open.\nThey were 1 over, and it looked as if they might have to play until dark.\n\"The playoff was ugly,\" Perry said. \"We were hitting it everywhere, having to scramble from all over the place.\"\nPerry finally finished off Hoffman, making a 22-foot birdie putt on the third extra hole Sunday at TPC Scottsdale.\nPerry closed with a 2-under 69 to match Hoffman (67) at 14-under 270. It was the 13th PGA Tour victory for Perry, the 48-year-old from Kentucky who won three times last year and played on the winning U.S. Ryder Cup team.\nPerry blew a chance to win in regulation, bogeying the final hole.\nIn the playoff, Perry and Hoffman bogeyed and parred the first two extra holes. Perry then rolled in the long putt on the 332-yard, par-4 17th to end the second straight playoff in the event.\n\"Kenny gave me a few opportunities, I gave him a few opportunities, and he happened to close the door,\" said Hoffman, who has one PGA Tour victory, the 2007 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.\nKevin Na (68) finished third at 13 under. Na rallied from six strokes back, but barely missed an 8-foot putt on the 18th hole that would have put him in the playoff.\nNa was briefly overcome with emotion after he missed the putt. After signing his scorecard, he said he was proud of himself for bouncing back from two bogeys in the first three holes.\n\"I couldn't have gotten off to any worse start,\" Na said. \"I was all over the lot.

The long-stalled Mexican Museum will occupy the first four floors of both the 10-story historic building and the new tower, taking up about 52,000 square feet.\nThe project will be Millennium Partners\u2019 third deluxe San Francisco high-rise \u2014 the group built the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences at 757 Market St. and the Millennium Tower at 301 Mission St. Resale prices of units in those two buildings regularly crack $2,000 a square foot.\nThe new high-rise will be different in that it will consist mostly of jumbo units with an average size of 2,700 square feet, about 30 to 40 percent bigger than average condos in comparable towers. At $2,000 a square foot, the units in the new tower could fetch an average of $5.4 million.\nThe three- and four-bedroom offerings will reach an audience not currently served by the other condos in SoMa and Rincon Hill, said Gregg Lynn, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nEven by Millennium Partners\u2019 lofty standards, the tower and Mexican Museum will be a complex and expensive undertaking. Millennium Tower, which has 419 units, cost $460 million to construct. The Mexican Museum tower, by contrast, will cost more to build but will have fewer than half the number of units.\nThe stratospheric costs are being driven by the fact that the project includes a $30 million museum, the restoration of a historic building, and a huge underground garage that also serves as the foundation for the Contemporary Jewish Museum and Jessie Square itself.\nThe project, however, isn\u2019t welcomed by all its neighbors. While luxury projects in San Francisco regularly are criticized by affordable-housing advocates, the Mexican Museum tower has faced opposition from an unexpected quarter \u2014 owners of units at a neighboring luxury tower.\nOver the past two years, the building has been the target of two lawsuits filed by the Friends of Yerba Buena Gardens, a group of mostly Four Seasons residents who argue that the project violated state environmental study requirements as well as the city\u2019s planning code in the process of winning approvals.

{"idx": "31452", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Sorry, this has been ages coming because of other commitments, but I promised a report on the BBC's conference at Salford called Closing the Gap. Its job was to work how to get another 250,000 people in the north of England to listen to Radio 4.\nLike all BBC think-seshes and consultations, it was very well-organised, thorough and genuine; and the corporation is already considered almost beyond criticism by the Guardian Northerner because of the sheer size and oomph of its move north. The sight of Radio 4 and Radio 5's controllers Gwynneth Williams and Adrian Van Klaveren in our own dear land had me whispering the Nunc Dimittis like Simeon.\nAnd Van Klaveren and his entire team are actually based on Salford Quays. I never thought I'd live to see such joys.\nThe most interesting part of the day for me was a data presentation by Rose Van Orden of BBC Audience Research which showed that Radio 4 already has pretty much all the information it needs to 'close the gap'. The gap is England's lop-sided listening to Radio 4, which has a 20.8 percent reach in England as a whole, 25.2 percent in London but only 16.5 percent in the three northern regions. Reach is a very modest thing; to qualify, you only have to listen for five minutes in an average week.\nThe northern deficit is long-standing \u2013 more or less consistent back to the start of the Radio Joint Audience Research System in 1992 \u2013 and does not appear to be linked with demographics. The north has as many of the target ABC1 listeners as England in general, and not a lot fewer than London. But Radio 4 is not reaching them in the same proportion to its listener profile down south. It is also doing worse than the other main BBC stations, and most local BBC radio and independent broadcasters.\nExcellent recent focus panels organised by Van Orden and her colleagues in Leeds and Liverpool were filmed and shown to Closing the Gap and they made one thing blindingly obvious. Northern ABC1s in particular do not appreciate their area being Eh-bah-gummed or, rather more literately, Room-at-the-Topped and Love-on-the-Doled into a pigeon-hole from the 1950s or earlier. And they really dislike patronising asides.\nA brilliant mimic in the audience took off Sandy Toksvig chortling about how naughty she was to keep mentioning the Tube and other endlessly Londony matters. \"So why does she?\" the mimic asked. Evan Davis on Today had got someone else's wick by referring to MediaCity in what they took as a dismissive tone as 'our Salford facility'.\nThese anecdotes were interesting because they ticked off two of Radio 4's best broadcasters, who may be surprised to be found wanting. But that seems to be central the problem. An unconscious metropolitanism has a greater hold of Radio 4 than its practitioners realise: they don't sound as if they know our part of the world; and they are increasingly being shown up by Radio Five Live.\nAnother highlight of the conference for me was Jane Garvey (ex-Five now 4) interviewing Van Klaveren, with the intelligence-minus-pompousness which distinguishes Five from much of 4 in my experience, and I suspect that of other northerners.

On the one hand, the publicity surrounding a movie release brings in a lot of new eyes, attracting people who are curious to see what the original material might look like. But you have to please those who've been drawn in by the film, and you run the risk of falling short of their expectations. After all, a budget of millions of dollars buys a lot of production value. It's enough to make some theater directors steer clear of shows that have been adapted into films, at least until some of the attention dies down. So I was a little surprised to hear Ralph Meranto, director of the JCC CenterStage production of \"Into the Woods,\" say that the film's release was what convinced him to bring the musical to the JCC.\nDuring an audience Q&A following Sunday's sold-out matinee performance, Meranto explained that he wanted to stage \"Into the Woods\" for some time, and once it seemed clear that the film would be diverging considerably from its source material, he decided that the time was right. It was his desire to present audiences with an opportunity to see the musical as it was meant to be seen: on the stage. And by that measurement, he's succeeded remarkably well. The result is an effective, straightforward production that doesn't stray too far from the path set by previous presentations.\nStephen Sondheim and James Lapine's revisionist fairy tale weaves together the stories of Cinderella (Katie Weber), Jack (Christopher Salvaggio) and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood (Adriana Scalice), and Rapunzel (Lani Toyama), and combines them with an original story about a childless Baker (Eric Williamson) and his wife (Sarah Peters). The couple learn that their inability to have a child is a result of a curse placed on their home by The Witch (Janine Mercandetti) who resides next door. If they want to reverse the curse, they must bring her four items: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a shoe as pure as gold. The couple sets out into the nearby woods in search of the items, crossing paths with the other characters, who end up affecting one another's stories in unexpected ways.\nThe intermission signals a shift in tone, and in Act Two the show explores what happens to the characters after their dreams come true. As they discover \"happily ever after\" doesn't automatically bring fulfillment, the characters face disappointment, infidelity, and death, things become more murky and unclear. It's dark, it's messy, and I love it.\nThe CenterStage production follows the book of the 2002 Broadway revival, which adds some material to the show, including an entire song, \"Our Little World,\" a cameo from the Three Little Pigs, and the appearance of a second wolf during the \"Hello Little Girl\" (among some other minor changes throughout). They're interesting additions, though none add much to the show.\nSondheim is always tricky, and here he weds complex themes to melodies as gnarled and twisty as the musical's woodsy setting, but the entire cast acquaint themselves well with the material.

Hospital officials were notified of the latest allegations in a letter dated Dec. 31.\nComplaints filed with the NLRB are evaluated by the board\u2019s regional office, which reviews evidence presented by both sides and then determines if there is enough evidence to support the charges. If the board authorizes a complaint, the defendant can settle without admitting guilt or contest the charges before an administrative law judge.\nThe employees first made contact with CNA in May after a series of changes that affected the nurses\u2019 ability to perform their work, such as a lack of clean linens for patients and new regulations for transporting patients, according to Paul Mignano, a 25-year employee and nurse in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.\nNurses said they had no support from their supervisors when they would bring up complaints about their work environment, Mignano said, and changes to benefits and a pay freeze over the past decade had steadily diminished morale among the nurses.\nBy June, union supporters say they began experiencing pressure from hospital administrators about attempts to unionize. However, hospital officials say the nurses have had nine months to call for an election to unionize but they have not done so.\nThe nurses say that, as a working environment, the hospital has room for improvement and that individual efforts to make positive changes have been futile and that a union is needed.\nThere are 1,200 nurses on the hospital\u2019s staff."}

The services offered have so many apparent deficiencies and inequalities, which shows that the standards for measuring services are not applied equally in every facility.\nMoreover, it is widely known that the number of healthcare facilities in the Kingdom is not enough to serve the large number of patients. Yet this problem can be solved through more and different types of services, and also with the improvement of the administrative system. But there are questions that need to be answered because there is perennial neglect, which is mysterious.\nA couple of days ago we heard the news of new cases of coronavirus infection among Saudi citizens, and the fact that the Ministry of Health cannot contain the recurrent infections is worrying. We need to know the reasons for this and on whom the blame should fall. Does the responsibility fall on the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Agriculture for example, and if it indeed falls on the Ministry of Health then the citizens of Saudi Arabia need answers. Is the problem financial or managerial? The fact that the disease continues to spread for years now is alarming.\nThere is another alarming issue, which is the delay by the ministry in Saudizing of health sector jobs. Apparently there is a huge disparity in the ratio of Saudi medical cadres. In the best-case scenario, the ratio is about 12 percent, and it is known that many Saudi medical school graduates are jobless. Some put this problem on the shoulders of the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties because the commission is considered the biggest barrier for qualified job seekers with obstacles that were criticized both by fresh graduates and those with many years of experience.\nIt is apparent that there is a glass barrier between the ministry and the Saudization program as hundreds of graduates remain jobless while available opportunities are given to less qualified people. This is a case that needs open discussion and there needs to be convincing answers.\nDespite the huge shortage of medical institutions able to provide services to the biggest healthcare market in the Middle East, there is another big mystery, which is the inability of the Ministry of Health to lure foreign and regional investors to fill the existing gap with attractive incentives.\nThe citizens need convincing answers, not just press releases, to so many confusing questions and alarming problems in this important ministry.\nAs they say health is a crown over the head of healthy people that is only seen by the sick.

Possibly because Edelstein is a Yisrael Beitenu minister, and such comments play well with that base.\nDuring the same event, Edelstein openly deplored racism \u2013 at least, some sort of racism. He was very angry about calls made by extreme ultra-Orthodox in Beit Shemesh towards policemen, displaying the tact and broad-mindedness we have came to expect of our ultra-Orthodox brethren: \u201cNazis, go back to Russia.\u201d Edelstein, himself a Russian immigrant, noted that he was jailed in Russia for Zionist activities and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I sat in prison with my Zion prisoners brothers for! That\u2019s not what I made aliyah for! We will not let anyone exclude others \u2013 neither because of gender or intra-Jewish ethnicity! The land of Israel belongs to us all.\u201d It\u2019s a good bet that Edelstein would not realize his comments contradict each other.\nTruly a creature worthy of contempt.\nlol. There are 80 million Arabs in Egypt alone.\nOh, I fully stand by \u201cMinistry of Propaganda.\u201d I refuse to use the Zionist euphemism.\nIsn\u2019t this guy a Likud member? When did he join Lieberman?\nI was under an impression that there are several propaganda agencies and ministries, Foreign Affairs should in principle engage in propaganda aimed at wider international audience (what is their aim it is hard to tell), and there is also domestic propaganda, e.g. IDF communication outfits, there is also Tourism Ministry, communications of Prime Minister plus a large government related NGO sector.\nSo giving Edelstein a lofty title of Propaganda Minister wrongly implies that he is coordinating all that stuff.\nEdelstein went from a place where all Jews were rootless cosmopolitans to a place where all Arabs are \u05e0\u05e4\u05e1\u05d3 and still doesn\u2019t catch the tune.\nSorry for my ignorance and I know it\u2019s probably irrelevant, but in the photo, who is the plastified person next to Edelstein?\nI think it was an excellent question. When a private individual arrives at a sweeping generalization, that may be on the basis of some hearsay, stemming from conversations with buddies on a hunting trip or prowling some web sites.

It could force Google to pay billions in fines or to alter the way it presents search results.\nSpecifically, the European Commission said that Google's promotion of its own comparison shopping search function may \"artificially divert traffic from rival comparison shopping services and hinder their ability to compete on the market.\" The commission, which has been investigating Google's search practices for about 5 years, detailed its concerns, known as a Statement of Objections, on Google's comparison shopping service here.\nThe accusations did not extend to other areas of search, like reviews and travel that Google's rivals like Yelp and TripAdvisor had complained about.\nBut the EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, also opened a formal investigation into whether Google has violated European antitrust laws with its Android operating system and related mobile services. The commission said it is concerned that Google may have hindered market access to rival mobile apps by pushing Android phone makers to pre-install its suite of mobile services, which include search, maps, Google Drive and the Play store. It also said it is concerned Google may have hindered market access to makers of modified versions of Android. The commission's full concerns on Android are detailed here.\nGoogle put out a vigorous defense. In a blog post, Google's search chief Amit Singhal said that people have more search choices today than ever before, and that competition among shopping search engines is thriving. \"Indeed if you look at shopping\u2014an area where we have seen a lot of complaints and where the European Commission has focused in its Statement of Objections\u2014it\u2019s clear that (a) there\u2019s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay , two of the biggest shopping sites in the world) and (b) Google\u2019s shopping results have not the harmed the competition,\" Singhal wrote.\nIn a separate blog post, Hiroshi Lockheimer, an engineering vice president for Android, rebutted the commission concerns regarding Google's mobile operating system. \"Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone,\" Lockheimer wrote.\nGoogle will now has 10 weeks to respond to the commissions charges.

In a surprising move NVIDIA is launching the GeForce GTX 570 with NVIDIA telling us that there will be immediate availability.\nAs the name suggests the GeForce GTX 570 squeezes in right behind the GeForce GTX 580 in both price and performance. The GeForce GTX 570 is the successor to the GeForce GTX 470. The new GeForce GTX 570 is going to be priced at an MSRP of $349. This is an excellent price point to target, and if you recall the GeForce GTX 470 launch, it was also launched with an MSRP of $349. With current price drops you can find GeForce GTX 470 video cards now for as low as $254.99.\nThe GeForce GTX 570 is based on the same GPU that is found in the GeForce GTX 580.

Junior guard Justin Sears, a first-team all-Ivy selection last season, has pulled in an impressive 8.8 boards per contest. Their most recent loss, an 85-47 routing at the hands of Florida, should have been expected. Otherwise, Yale has shown an ability to win in a variety of ways, which will be necessary against its slate of conference opponents.\nColumbia (5-2): While the Lions haven\u2019t been particularly explosive offensively \u2014their 59.0 points per game average is the Ivy League\u2019s lowest \u2014their defense has been stifling. Opponents have shot 37.0 percent from the field and a mere 23.9 percent from three-point land. Senior forward Alex Rosenberg and junior guard Maodo Lo are two of the league\u2019s elite scorers and should help rally the Columbia offense in the coming weeks.\nBrown (5-6): In each of his first two seasons, junior forward Cedric Kuakumensah earned Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year honors. The 6\u20199\u201d big man is perhaps the conference\u2019s best-ever shot blocker, having broken the league\u2019s single-season records both his freshman and sophomore years. The graduation of senior guard Sean McGonagill will leave a substantial hole in this offense.\nCornell (5-4): Surprising the preseason pundits who picked the Big Red to finish dead last, this Cornell squad has managed some impressive early season wins. Its defensive rebounding has been among the Ivy League\u2019s best, while opponents have shot inefficient marks of 37.0 from the field and 31.5 from beyond the arc.\nPrinceton (3-6): A lax perimeter defense has allowed opponents to shoot a 44.7 percent from beyond the arc, by far the worst mark in the Ivy League. This squad has more potential than some of their losses indicate. Guard combo Spencer Weisz, a sophomore, and Amir Bell, a freshman, have been effective despite their relative inexperience.\nDartmouth (2-4): The Big Green does not return any all-Ivy selections, making this team somewhat at a loss for production. Junior guard Alex Mitola is a precise shooter who ranks among the school leaders in converted three-pointers.

Isn't it time the party quit this charade that it wants to make abortion \"rare\"?\nThe \"conscience clause,\" which appeared in the 1996 and 2000 platforms, at least paid lip service to tempering the platform's express support of a woman's \"right to choose,\" stating: The \"Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party.\"\nBut the party ended all pretense of inclusion in 2004 by replacing the \"conscience clause\" with a statement that Democrats \"stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine\" abortion rights. And despite the obviously halfhearted efforts of Democrats for Life, the clause will also be absent from the 2008 platform.\nAs Democrats for Life's Director Kristen Day asked during the 2004 platform debate: \"So what are they saying, that because we want to protect the rights of the unborn, our own party says we're automatically Republicans? This has to be one reason that our party is having trouble appealing to many people in churches.\"\nAmen, Kristen. But perhaps instead you ought to be asking yourself why you are still a Democrat and why you gave up in 2008 with barely a whimper. Just how committed can you and your organization possibly be to protecting the lives of the unborn when you shamelessly roll over on the issue that presumably matters the most to you?\nActually, \"shamelessly roll over\" doesn't do justice to what happened. Kristen Day told ABC News, \"We decided not to offer an amendment because we are working with the party to try to solve this issue.\" What? That's like saying they'll begin to fight after conceding defeat.\nBesides, just what incentive do the overwhelmingly dominant pro-abortion forces in the party have to work with Day when they succeeded, effortlessly, in inserting the following language in the platform?\n\"The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.\"\nNo mincing words there. \"Strongly and unequivocally regardless of ability to pay oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine.\" By removing the word \"Republican\" before \"efforts,\" they even closed the loophole that might allow Democratic renegades such as Day to try to \"undermine\" the Democrats' commitment to throwing babies under the bus. And with the language \"regardless of ability to pay,\" they've made clear their support for taxpayer-funded abortions.\nThis party has the temerity to pretend it is inclusive and wants to reduce abortions yet bans any dissent on the issue! It doesn't even want pro-life people in the party -- unless they stay in the closet. Day and her group apparently value party membership so highly that they've dutifully agreed to march quietly back into the closet.\nFor insight into what Democratic honchos mean when they cynically hold themselves out as advocates of reducing abortion, we must turn to the words of the Rev.

{"idx": "31494", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Increasingly high profile one-off events like sports tournaments and elections are becoming the target of hackers.\nProtecting these is tough because even if the hosts have a sound security infrastructure for day-to-day operations, they often don't have the resources necessary to lock down a large scale, high-profile event which requires additional physical and cybersecurity to protect against disruption, revenue loss or other irreversible damage.\nThe answer may lie in the idea of a 'pop-up' security operations center (SOC) which can be deployed quickly to deal with times of abnormal traffic and network distress at large events. We spoke to Dave Gold, VP of solutions architecture at ProtectWise, to find out more.\nBN: What sort of things can pop-up SOCs be used for?\nDG: Pop-up SOCs are used for high-profile events, often temporary, where there\u2019s a need to deploy security and protect the event. Things like international football leagues, major league baseball, other professional sports leagues, trade shows and conferences, anywhere that you need to spin up a security operations team very quickly. There's also a need in things like the military where assets and troops move around, as well as political events and campaigns. All of these things need technology that can be spun up and deployed quickly and that can provide visibility into the entire environment.\nBN: What are the major threats to these types of event?\nDG: The threats can be all over the place. Denial of service is a big one, to be able to be disruptive and make a name for yourself -- we saw that with the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. They are not than different from attacks on normal commercial networks, so credential theft, attacks on point of sale systems, and so on. There's also valuable data in these environments.\nBN: Are elections and other events seen as an easier target?\nDG: Yes, there's a perception too that these things are not very secure because they are temporary. Higher profile event targets can be seen as easier because they don\u2019t have all of the technology that an established company has in its everyday networks.\nBN: Is a pop-up SOC a supplement to existing security tools?\nDG: Typically events will have a standard security operations team, but they will be looking for additional resources from, vendors, partners, law enforcement and so on to help augment their staff. Ideally they want all of the tools they would have on a permanent network, so firewalls, security analytics, all the things that you would normally want to see. The challenge is that there may only be a couple of days to stand these up and the technology requires a lot of configuration, a lot of appliances to be shipped on site, cabled and configured. A cloud delivered solution or a solution that is software virtualized is therefore preferable.\nAt ProtectWise we can send our sensor on site and deploy it in minutes because the work is done in the cloud. We can get complete packet level visibility to everything that is going across the network, identify threats and respond in a very quick way. Delivering the solution from the cloud also means it can be accessed remotely so you remove much of the challenge of physically getting people to the events.\nThe SOC can of course also deploy on top of whatever basic level of technology is already there at the venue and will supply the data that you need to understand what is happening and see if there is an attack or if something unusual is going on.\nBN: How fast can a pop-up SOC be deployed and what technology drives that?\nDG: We basically record the whole network and create a forensic memory that can be analyzed for threats.

Last year, Willowbrook lost to eventual Class 6A champion Prairie Ridge in the quarterfinals.\nWalenga thinks the Warriors are well-served by that experience going against Batavia, the defending Class 7A champ.\n\"We did not come out very strong against Prairie Ridge. We learned from that,\" Walenga said. \"We had to make sure we come out hard this week, starting with Monday practices, trying to be better than the week before.\"\nIt was reasonable to wonder how good Willowbrook would be this year, after losing a senior class led by 2,000-yard rusher Jack Jessen.\nThat question wasn't just outside the locker room, either.\n\"I was personally skeptical,\" said Walenga, Willowbrook's left tackle and one of two returning linemen. \"I knew we lost a bunch of good guys. After a month or so working with them, though, we all kind of knew that this season was going to be pretty good.\"\nA headliner to that success is junior quarterback Sam Tumilty, who has thrown for over 2,000 yards and run for over 1,200.\n\u200e\"Sam is a very athletic guy,\" Walenga said. \"In case the pocket collapses, we know he can run with it. It's really interesting to see him go.\"\nWalenga doesn't know a ton about Batavia (11-0), but he is well aware of their linebackers. Michael Jansey, a Northwestern recruit and Luke Weerts, a North Dakota State commits, are marquee names off last year's title team. Junior Quinn Urwiler, also part of Batavia's backfield rotation, has had a hug year on both sides of the ball.\n\"They're a little bit bigger up front,\" Walenga said. \"On the difficulty level, I would compare them to a Hinsdale Central, of the teams we've played.

(PA).\nThe offshore wind industry has already opened up exciting opportunities for Yorkshire and the Offshore Wind Sector Deal now being discussed with Government will bring significant further growth.\nThese opportunities build on a manufacturing tradition stretching back to the Industrial Revolution, and the same spirit of innovation and craftsmanship that harnessed coal and steam is now delivering 21st century solutions for clean, green power.\nThere are high-profile examples such as Siemens\u2019 magnificent state-of-the-art blade factory in Hull, but I am also interested in the wide variety of companies that are winning work in this dynamic sector, where the UK occupies a leading position with the largest installed offshore wind capacity in the world.\nThis is helping firms like Specialist Marine Services in Filey, which provides technicians for offshore wind farms, and M C Construction in Middlesbrough, which makes specialist components used to keep turbine blades secure while they\u2019re shipped out for installation, to develop internationally competitive products and services.\nAnd then there are the entrepreneurs working in the supply chain, such as the former Asda store manager who now runs a digital media business which was commissioned to film the construction of the Siemens factory.\nOffshore wind is a rapidly expanding sector touching many parts of the UK\u2019s economy, including manufacturing, engineering, research and transport.\nBut there is so much more we can do to ensure the UK\u2019s world-leading offshore wind industry continues to expand successfully over the next decade, bringing even greater economic benefits. This is precisely why I\u2019m so pleased to have taken on a new role representing the hundreds of companies, large and small, across the country \u2013 and particularly those in our manufacturing and coastal communities \u2013 which stand to benefit from the Government\u2019s Industrial Strategy.\nAs the Sector Champion for Offshore Wind, I will be articulating the industry\u2019s vision of what is possible between now and 2030 to Ministers. We need to retain our position as the number one destination for offshore wind investment. We can secure \u00a348bn of investment in UK infrastructure, increasing the number of jobs in the offshore wind industry from 11,000 today to 27,000 by the end of the next decade. By that time, offshore wind can be generating one-third of the UK\u2019s electricity, with 30 gigawatts of capacity installed. It will be the backbone of our modern clean energy system, critical to meeting our CO2 reduction targets and our global commitments to address climate change, helping ensure that we leave a habitable and productive world for our children and grandchildren.\nOur vision for 2030 is for clean power \u2013 at no additional cost to the consumer \u2013 supporting a fivefold increase exports to \u00a32.6bn a year. UK companies are already exporting offshore wind products and services to Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA, as well as to the rest of Europe. Hundreds of contracts \u2013 from \u00a350,000 to \u00a330m \u2013 are already being struck each year. As we look to grow global markets, offshore wind offers real potential for UK plc.

As the coming auto revolution becomes dinner-table conversation, these past few weeks have served as a nice snapshot of an industry at an inflection point.\nSilicon Valley autoAfter opening up its test center recently to journalists, and garnering a wave of headlines in the process, Alphabet -- until recently, known as Google -- is now the poster child of the automotive revolution.Its fleet of 48 autonomous vehicles, including 25 adorable prototypes, have driven 1.2 million miles by themselves and another 900,000 with a human driver. Those miles are collective; thanks to machine learning, each vehicle contains the lessons of those 2.1 million total miles driven.\nThey have been involved in a few accidents along the way, but it has (allegedly) never been the computer&apos;s fault. Besides, an autonomous car doesn&apos;t have to be perfect; it just has to be better than a human, and it is easily leaping over that low hurdle. It is estimated that driverless cars will ultimately reduce auto fatalities by 90%, which would be about 300,000 American lives saved a year.\nInvestors shouldn&apos;t confuse Alphabet&apos;s tests with some fun science project: The company is serious about changing how we travel. And it should be, as the addressable market easily dwarfs the opportunity in smartphones and Android devices by orders of magnitude. Capturing only a small percentage of the multitrillion-dollar mobility market could mean tens of billions in revenue to the company. To that end, Alphabethired well-regarded auto veteran John Krafcik on Sept. 13 to lead the operation. He worked at Ford before running Hyundai&apos;s U.S. operations, and also served as CEO of TrueCar. His experience will become invaluable when commercializing this venture. It&apos;s unlikely that Alphabetwill build this fleet itself -- it&apos;s actively looking to partner with an existing OEM to quickly scale production, which could be a contract manufacturer such as Magna or perhaps even a traditional automaker. Investors should watch developments closely.\nAlphabet&apos;s fiercest rival, Apple , is not about to cede this enormous market opportunity without a fight. In fact, the world&apos;s most valuable company is further along than many realize, given the shroud of secrecy that hangs over Apple product development. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is targeting a 2019 release date --yes, one year before Alphabet&apos;s. The Journalalso reports that Apple has a team of 600 already working on Project Titan, and a mandate to triple that staffing.

This has left many women confused and worried, especially if manicures are an integral part of their beauty routine.\nThe good news is that you can paint your nails while pregnant. The bad news is you have to be careful what polish you use. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a chemical used in many high street nail-polish brands and some experts are worried that breathing in the fumes could be dangerous for unborn babies. However, there is no clear evidence of this and stressing too much while pregnant is not good for you or your baby.\nMore often than not polishes also contain chemicals such as formaldehyde and toluene. Formaldehyde is used as a nail hardener and can irritate eyes, noses, throats and lungs of those who already have an allergy to it. Toluene makes the consistency of the polish smooth and is used by manufactures to make sure the polish gives a good finish. If you want to be on the safe side, choose polishes that don\u2019t contain either of these chemicals \u2013 you can then paint your nails to your hearts content! If you cannot get hold of any varnishes free of these substances but still want to have pretty nails, use normal polishes but limit your use to once a week and open all doors and windows when painting your nails so the fumes are dispersed.\nWhen it comes to taking your nail polish off you should try to avoid all removers that contain acetone. Studies have shown that being exposed to this for long periods of time could lead to birth defects. However, the chances are tiny and unless you work in a nail salon it is very unlikely this would affect you or your baby. Other products you should try to avoid while pregnant are decorating paints and oven cleaners as these can contain solvents that on occasion have been linked to birth defects in children.\nThe best way to make sure you are away from both these chemicals is to hand the painting and cleaning over to your partner and leave the house, keeping well away from any fumes, for a well-deserved lunch with your girlfriends!\nDrinking alcohol while pregnant: Safe or risky?"}

Back home in Taketoyo, it was now 8 a.m. Saturday. Like many Japanese couples, they were on a whirlwind honeymoon trip--Los Angeles, Las Vegas and home again, all in one week.\nWe'd met only an hour earlier, when I'd accosted Niimi as she browsed among the high-end goods in a Little Tokyo emporium. She'd eyed with understandable suspicion this woman who was either trying to tell her something or sell her something. She could have fled, but didn't.\nBut it was just a reporter trying desperately to circumvent the language barrier. Niimi, 29, studied my business card. Just then her husband appeared. He, too, studied it. It was painfully apparent that we were not connecting.\nStill, they were either too polite or too flummoxed to invent a sudden and urgent appointment. Rather, Niimi slipped away and returned with a bilingual tour guide who, while equally puzzled, was able to explain what this was all about.\nTentatively, Niimi took a little Japanese-English phrase book from her backpack and pointed to \"I'm glad to meet you.\" Just then, the tour guide reminded them that in 15 minutes their city tour would be departing. They agreed to let a visitor come along, and we slid into seats on a Sunflower USA tour bus.\nThe commentary was, of course, in their tongue, laced with English highlights: Shaquille O'Neal (who did not register on the Japanese tourists' radar), Staples Center, California, Los Angeles, Santa Monica Pier, barracuda, McDonald's, Burger King, California wine, Century City, Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Whisky-a-go-go, House of Blues, Hollywood.\nLeaning across the aisle, I learned that Niimi and Morita's hometown, Taketoyo, is a coastal city of about 40,000 in the south of Japan, about three hours by express train from Tokyo; that Morita, 38, is a missile engineer and Niimi an office worker for a company that makes dolls.\nFirst stop: Santa Monica Place, where Niimi considered, but ultimately passed on, a souvenir Santa Monica sweatshirt emblazoned with a palm tree. Only the children's size fit her, and that one didn't come in a V-neck.\nWhile the others from the bus fanned out around the mall, Niimi and Makoto were content to find a spot to sit and enjoy some freshly squeezed California orange juice. They hadn't slept much on that airplane.\nBack on the bus, she and I made a breakthrough discovery: pencil and paper. Asked how she'd met her husband of two weeks, she drew two little stick figures on a flight of stairs.

It can be traumatizing and anxiety-inducing to end a relationship that was once so pivotal. Sometimes we convince ourselves that an unhealthy friendship will get better \u2014 even when history has proven it won\u2019t.\nSheKnows spoke with two experts, Amber L. Wright and Christine Gutierrez, to understand what causes us to linger in toxic friendships and how we can effectively end them.\nSheKnows: Do you feel negative self-talk contributes to our willingness to stay in unhealthy friendships?\nAmber L. Wright: I absolutely think that there\u2019s a link. If we tell ourselves that we are not pretty or smart enough, or worse \u2014 that we\u2019re not worthy of love \u2014 our friendships will reflect that. We\u2019ll find ourselves connected to other women who don\u2019t respect our opinions or value our presence. Oftentimes in this case, the relationship will fall out of balance and one will end up giving more to sustain the friendship than the other.\nSK: Why are long-term friendships especially difficult to end, even when they are no longer healthy for us?\nChristine Gutierrez: All relationships, including friendships, are created with emotional bonds and memories. This is what therapists like to call an \u201cattachment\u201d and sometimes even if the friendship is no longer working for us, we feel attached to the old idea of what it used to be and find it scary to let go.\nPerhaps there is a desire to keep trying to work it out, or a fear of confrontation, which are normal feelings associated with letting go and stepping into new territories. Letting go is not easy. Even if our mind knows, sometimes it takes awhile for our actions to follow.\nSK: What are the warning signs that we are in an unhealthy friendship?\nCG: There will be a lack of healthy boundaries, a lack of respect, even a physically aching feeling when you\u2019re around that person. Also, there may be abusive, belittling behavior that is verbal, emotional or even physical. The friend in question may be someone that is mean, disrespectful, jealous and/or unsupportive of you. If you find yourself scared to be yourself and don\u2019t feel emotionally safe, this is a big warning sign you are in an unhealthy friendship. It\u2019s important that people understand that positive relationships and friendships are based on love, support, healthy and safe communication, respect, healthy boundaries and happiness.\nSK: When we finally realize that we are in a friendship that is toxic and needs to end, how can we do that without causing a blow out?\nAW: Being clear on why the friendship needs to end is the first step toward making the transition. If you can identify what it is about the person or friendship that is giving you pause, it\u2019ll make it easier to discuss it when the time for the \u201cbreakup talk\u201d happens.\nIn some cases, a blow out may be inevitable. Always remember, however, that you can\u2019t control how the other person will respond, but you can control what you say and how you say it.\nCG: Also, a great place to start is by doing a \u201cfriend inventory.\u201d Write down the names of friends you spend your time with, starting with those you spend the most time with, and honestly ask yourself, how they make you feel? Do you feel safe, supported, loved, honored, inspired and respected?\nIf not, then some difficult conversations need to happen to adjust the dynamic, or if that can\u2019t be done, you may want to minimize your time with them and slowly let the friendship"}

That was her style. I remember she gossiped about her daughter\u2019s relationship skills\u2026completely failing to mention the shocking abuse both her children bore as children. Then she, oh! so subtly implied that her son had struggled with alcohol, undoubtedly to convince me and herself that her husband\u2019s (former) alcoholism was simply genetic and thus neither his imbibing nor his drunken abuse of his children could possibly be his fault!\nWhen I hosted this couple, I\u2019d not realized any of this.

Of course, I made another piece of buttered, mayo toast, apologizing profusely!\nBack then I was completely a Little Nell from the Codependent Country, eager to please and desperate that everyone like me.

Why? Because I had set a boundary. I had specifically told her not to wash the dishes and she bashed that boundary. She took over.

By 2018 the company plans to spend $1.57 billion on technologies including grid-scale battery storage, hydrogen output, \u201cmini-grids\u201d that serve small clusters of homes, and smart buildings that link up the heating, lighting and IT systems to save energy and cut costs.\nLepercq said the cost of solar power would probably drop below $10 per megawatt-hour before 2025 in the world\u2019s sunniest places, turning it into the cheapest source of electricity. With the falling costs of battery storage, solar will become even more competitive which means electric vehicles could challenge traditional passenger vehicles.\n\u201cAs carmakers offer more electrical vehicles with a range exceeding 500 kilometers, charging stations being progressively deployed and more cities banning gasoline and diesel cars, a shift will gradually take place,\u201d said Lepercq.\nData from the International Energy Agency shows the number of battery and plug-in vehicles around the world has surged to one million cars.\nAccording to Lepercq, in less than 10 years hydrogen which can turn solar power into transportable fuel may be as cheap as LNG.\nEngie has recently conducted a \u201cvery deep modeling\u201d of the French Provence-Alpes-Cote d\u2019Azur region. The results showed the region with five million inhabitants could run entirely on renewables by 2030 for as much as 20 percent less cost than the current energy system.

{"idx": "31536", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The growing concern of type 2 diabetes needs no introduction \u2014 so, identifying a drug that is already in circulation that might help to fight the condition would be a welcome discovery.\nFinding improved treatments for diabetes is a pressing issue.\nType 2 diabetes is rarely out of the headlines \u2014 and for good reason. Approximately 30.3 million people in the United States have diabetes, the vast majority of whom have type 2 diabetes.\nThis equates to about 1 in 10 U.S. citizens. Some states are hit harder than others. In Mississipi, for instance, almost 1 in 7 residents have a diabetes diagnosis.\nWhen you consider that about 1 in 4 people with diabetes do not yet know that they have it, the figures are nothing short of staggering.\nIt's all the more worrying when you remember that, although type 2 diabetes can be successfully managed in many cases, it is a condition that many will have for life. As such, diabetes is a huge burden on a person physically, mentally, and financially.\nBecause of the huge numbers involved and the significant suffering that it can bring, research into innovative treatments for type 2 diabetes is constantly rolling on.\nIn brief, type 2 diabetes is caused by lifestyle factors such as inactivity, poor diet, and obesity. It is a metabolic disorder that causes cells to stop responding to insulin. This has the effect of raising the level of sugar in the blood, which, in turn, damages the organs and systems of the body.\nAlongside lifestyle interventions, many people with diabetes take medication to help keep their blood sugar levels in check. Although these can be useful, some have adverse side effects and others become less effective as they are used for longer periods of time. Researchers are keen, therefore, to find better alternatives.\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can cause swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. This chronic condition affects around 1 percent of the world's population.\nInterestingly, a drug that has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for many years might be of use for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\nThis might seem surprising as the two conditions are worlds apart, but some links and interactions between the two have been noted over the years.\nLeflunomide may also be useful in the fight against melanoma, according to a recent study.\nFor instance, people with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop diabetes, and people with diabetes are more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Also, individuals with rheumatoid arthritis who go on to develop type 2 diabetes tend to have a harder time controlling their blood sugar levels.\nLeflunomide is an anti-inflammatory drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in arthritis in 1998. Over the years, some scientists have noted that leflunomide seems to lower blood glucose levels and, in obese people, even lead to weight loss. But it has not been clear how or why these interactions occurred.\nRecently, Prof. Xiulong Xu and team \u2014 from the Institute of Comparative Medicine at Yangzhou University in China \u2014 investigated this unexpected relationship in more detail.\nTo identify the action of leflunomide in individuals with type 2 diabetes, they utilized two separate mouse models for diabetes. In both models, the drug not only improved blood sugar levels but actually caused cells to begin reacting to insulin again.\nThe intriguing results are published this week in"}

However, when one breaks down the numbers, it is clear that not all demographics are contributing equally to this situation.\nAccording to the report, about 25 percent of millennials voted in the 2016 general election while baby boomers made up a third of the voters. That rate of voting does not align with the number of citizens in those demographic groups, as millennials are 32 percent of the adult population while baby boomers represent 29 percent.\nThis is reflected in ASU\u2019s own USG elections as well. Even though ASU has a student body population of over 100,000 students, only 1,955 total voted in last year\u2019s USG elections.\n\u201cOf course I wish more students went out and voted in the election, but it\u2019s not just students not voting, it\u2019s students not running,\u201d Aly Perkins, USGD president and senior studying public service and public policy, said.\nIn spring 2018, Perkins ran uncontested, meaning she and her campaign had no opponents, leaving students with only one option to vote for.\nGarcia said students are often focused on short-term politics and large-scale issues that are feasts for the media. However, much of what actually impacts ASU students and millennials alike are the smaller issues such as budget cuts to a certain school program or state legislation that may change a state policy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making the connection between voting in the election and your personal life,\u201d he said.\nPerkins hopes to increase student interest in ASU politics as well as state and national politics by presenting students with information on what USG is doing and how it impacts students.\n\u201cIf people aren\u2019t hearing about the upcoming elections constantly through the media ... they aren\u2019t paying it enough attention and getting themselves educated on the issues being discussed,\u201d Garcia said.\nGarcia and Daugherty\u2019s study on Arizona\u2019s voter \"crisis\" showed that more people vote in national elections than state and local elections, primarily because they hear more about them."}

Between 2013 and September 2018, 135 credit unions merged with larger peers, it said. But while the number of registered unions fell 35 per cent since 2013, there has only been an 8 per cent reduction in business locations.\nRestructuring has had the effect of reducing the number of smaller credit unions (with assets of less than \u20ac40 million) by 58 per cent, leading to a 93 per cent increase in larger facilities (with assets of more than \u20ac100 million).\nSo while the absolute number of credit unions has fallen significantly (from 419 in September 2008 to 254 in September 2018), that hasn\u2019t \u201cnegatively impacted upon membership numbers\u201d in the sector, the Central Bank noted. Between 2013 and 2017, the sector gained 194,000 customers, to bring its total to more than 3.3 million.\n\u201cAs well as giving transferee credit unions a larger base of income generating assets, in the form of transferred loans and investments, this inorganic growth has also led to faster underlying organic growth in investments and loans,\u201d the review stated.\n\u201cThis suggests that restructuring has enhanced the financial performance and outlook of transferee credit unions,\u201d it found, adding that \u201ctransferee credit unions appear to be outperforming the rest of the credit union sector\u201d.\nAs a result of those findings, the bank suggested that credit union boards, when considering their strategy, consider the opportunities that a merger can bring, particularly with membership and engagement.\nAnd while lending is likely to grow, a reduction in expenses can be expected, given data published by the bank. It found those credit unions that had engaged in restructuring had seen a lower rate of increase in expenses (not including salary costs) than those that had not \u2013 25 per cent compared with 39 per cent \u2013 \u201cindicating that credit unions restructuring have been able to achieve economies of scale\u201d.\nIn terms of salary costs, those institutions that have restructured will have seen a higher rise of 23 per cent compared with the 17 per cent rise at credit unions that have not restructured. The bank believes this may indicate a strategic decision by the larger institutions to invest in better resourcing risk and compliance functions.\n\u201cAll credit unions should examine their cost structures to seek opportunities to eliminate duplicated costs, and seek to avoid unnecessary expenditure,\u201d the bank concluded while making the case for restructuring.\nWho were the convicted bankers?\nCan An Post deliver a mortgage partner?"}

He gets his tunes from AmieStreet.com, an indie music site that taps its users to spread the word on good music and prices songs based on their popularity. Nothing about that system is illegal, but Shawcroft thinks it could be the future of the music industry \u2014 a system in which customers give money directly to artists and not to anyone else.\nHe thinks it\u2019s wrong for an industry to be creating \u201cartificial scarcity\u201d by restricting access to things that can be universally accessible.

The discipline of tracking expenses, assigning an amount for each and then staying within the allocated budget can all be a put-off. However, one has to start somewhere. \u201cThe ideal point to start is to make a distinction between discretionary and non-discretionary expenses and see how much you are spending on things,\" said Manish Shah, co-founder and chief executive officer, BigDecisions.com, a financial advisory.\nA simple method to make sure you are on the right track if you are just a beginner is to work with percentages. It will help you identify where you are overspending. Here is how you can do so and how much you should allocate to each expense.\nFirst of all, limit each head of expense to a range. This will help you stay within your income and take care of saving priority. \u201cWork with your take-home pay so that you don\u2019t exceed what\u2019s available. At the same time, consider any allowance, such as for accommodation or travel. Write down all expenses for three months and then review. Care should be taken to reduce unwanted items in future. Based on this, one can prepare a budget,\" said Melvin Joseph, founder and chief financial planner, Finvin Financial Planners.\nHere are some percentages that can be used as pointers. Use the percentages as guides, but custom tailor the budget.\nSavings\u201415% onwards: The first goal for your savings should be to create an emergency fund. \u201cThere are three basic types of emergencies\u2014loss of life, medical and job loss or potential loss in business. Be adequately insured for all three,\" said Shah.\nFor medical emergencies, financial planners advise on contingency funds for 3-9 months\u2019 expenses. Also, have adequate medical insurance apart from what is provided by your employer.\n\u201cTry and start saving as early as possible in life. In fact, the sooner you start, the easier it will become for you to inculcate it as a habit,\" said Shilpi Johri, head-financial planning, Arthashastra Consulting, a Gurgaon-based financial advisory. Have an investment plan in place so that your savings will work towards meeting various financial goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to work on limiting your expenses as a family. In a single-income family, one member can curb the other\u2019s expenses. Children, too, should be involved in activities, such as, saving electricity,\" said Prakash Praharaj, founder, Max Secure Financial Planners, adding that these small contributions make the family aware of expenses.\nHousing\u201425-33%: Housing is a major expense to be met out of one\u2019s available income. It may be in the form of rent or equated monthly instalment (EMI) on a home loan. Include any mortgage insurance, taxes and other mandatory dues on the property in this amount. Exceeding one-third of your income, especially in the form of a loan, is risky to financial stability since it will restrict your ability to spend or even take loans for other needs.\nFood\u201415-25%: Along with housing, this constitutes the biggest expense of a household, especially when income is low. This includes eating out, and if you find yourself exceeding the allotted limits, this may be the cause. \u201cKeeping an eye on how many times you eat out, which is a discretionary expense, can be a good way to regulate your budget because you can eat out at a place for 5"}

Kate Stanton-Paule, the teacher who had set up the meeting, accompanied him. But his first words upon entering the office were, like most things involving Justin, not in the script.\nAs the employees exchanged nervous glances that morning in January 2010, Ms. Stanton-Paule, the coordinator of a new kind of \u201ctransition to adulthood\u201d program for special education students at Montclair High School, wondered if they were all in over their heads.\nJustin, who barely spoke until he was 10, falls roughly in the middle of the spectrum of social impairments that characterize autism, which affects nearly one in 100 American children. He talks to himself in public, has had occasional angry outbursts, avoids eye contact and rarely deviates from his favorite subject, animation. His unabashed expression of emotion and quirky sense of humor endear him to teachers, therapists and relatives. Yet at 20, he had never made a true friend.\nPeople with autism, whose unusual behaviors are believed to stem from variations in early brain development, typically disappear from public view after they leave school. As few as one in 10 hold even part-time jobs. Some live in state-supported group homes; even those who attend college often end up unemployed and isolated, living with parents.\nBut Justin is among the first generation of autistic youths who have benefited throughout childhood from more effective therapies and hard-won educational opportunities. And Ms. Stanton-Paule\u2019s program here is based on the somewhat radical premise that with intensive coaching in the workplace and community \u2014 and some stretching by others to include them \u2014 students like Justin can achieve a level of lifelong independence that has eluded their predecessors.\nWith some 200,000 autistic teenagers set to come of age in the United States over the next five years alone, little is known about their ability to participate fully in public life, or what it would take to accommodate them. Across the country, neighbors, employers, colleagues and strangers are warily interacting with young adults whose neurological condition many associate only with children.\nSome advocates of \u201cneurodiversity\u201d call this the next civil rights frontier: society, they say, stands to benefit from accepting people whose brains work differently. Opening the workplace to people with autism could harness their sometimes-unusual talents, advocates say, while decreasing costs to families and taxpayers for daytime aides and health care and housing subsidies, estimated at more than $1 million over an adult lifetime.\nBut such efforts carry their own costs. In this New York City suburb, the school district considered scrapping Ms. Stanton-Paule\u2019s program almost as soon as it began, to save money on the extra teaching assistants who accompanied students to internships, the bank, the gym, the grocery store. Businesses weighed the risks of hiring autistic students who might not automatically grasp standard rules of workplace behavior.\nOblivious to such debates, many autistic high school students are facing the adult world with"}

Brightcove 3 includes new media management and publishing tools for streamlining production workflow, and the updated Flash-based video player is designed to be easily customized through templates, which means that a company can achieve a professional look without having an advanced Web developer on staff.\nOne of the new customers for Brightcove 3 is FEARnet, the on-demand horror network created by Comcast in partnership with Sony Pictures and Lionsgate Entertainment. FEARnet began using the Brightcove software this month to replace a proprietary platform.\nPaulo Lemgruber, senior VP, digital for Comcast Emerging Networks, says that Brightcove 3 allows FEARnet to offer a full-screen video player, and that the ability to attach metatags to the video makes it easy for search-engine crawlers to find and index the video.\nBrightcove 3 also offers more flexibility for placing advertising around FEARnet content, which consists of movies, original series and behind-the-scenes features, he adds. FEARnet currently offers pre-, mid- and post-rolls and skins, and is also thinking about experimenting with in-video ad windows. \"It creates a lot of ad inventory we didn&apos;t have before,\" Lemgruber says.\nFEARnet is using the Brightcove player to deliver streaming video at up to 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) at 720-line-progressive resolution, and has plans to increase the data rate up to 3 Mbps in the future, he adds.\nCambridge, Mass.-based Brightcove, which was founded in 2004, has raised $91 million to date and continues to grow. When looking at its entire customer base of more than 400 companies, Allaire says, its video players are used by 135 million monthly unique users.

We've never had such an experience,\" praised Hernandez. \"We enjoyed the experience we've had with each other.\"\nIntimidated at first to play with them, Pinsonneault, a life time musician, appreciated the opportunity to play with his Salvadoran band counterparts here.\n\"I was honored,\" continued Pinsonneault. \"I was concerned about not playing my instrument for three months while assigned here, but having a band that I can actually practice with is amazing. So when they asked me to join them, I was honored to sit in with them.\"\nA trumpeter himself, Pinsonneault was impressed by the talent in their trumpet section.\n\"Their trumpet players are amazing,\" Pinsonneault said. \"They are really good. It was a little intimidating sitting next to them because of how good they play.\"\nTraditional with concert bands, feature performances are a way to recognize talented musicians.\n\"The conductor of the band wanted me to play a solo on a song I didn't know very well,\" continued Pinsonneault. \"I tried to practice it, but I didn't really know the song and didn't have much time to practice it, so the conductor graciously chose a song I knew well, 'In the Mood.'\"\nEven with the conductor adamant about me playing the solo, Pinsonneault was grateful for the opportunity to play in their band, never mind playing a solo with them.\nLater that night, the band performed for more than 150 Salvadoran and U.S. personnel at a local bazaar.

{"idx": "31567", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I\u2019m wondering about the different choices I have when it comes to deck flashing materials. What are my choices, and what are their pros and cons? What would you use on your own home if given the choice? I\u2019ve seen on other websites that some of the modern caulks with lifetime warranties are just fine. \u2014 Debb D., Santa Rosa, Calif.\nLet\u2019s crush the caulk myth right away. I\u2019m a big fan of caulk for many jobs around a house, but relying on it to flash a deck to a house is the last thing I\u2019d choose. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if some of the caulk manufacturers that offer lifetime warranties are using the warranty more as a marketing gimmick than a statement about the product\u2019s ability to perform for decades without failure.\nBased on what I\u2019ve seen in my short time on this planet and what the sun\u2019s powerful and unrelenting ultraviolet (UV) light can do to metal, I\u2019d say that no caulk is going to last and last. UV light is so powerful it causes durable materials to fall apart and disintegrate. This is why paint chalks, deck coatings fail, zinc coatings disappear from metal roofs and wood fibers fall apart when exposed to sunlight. Imagine what UV rays can do to soft and pliable caulk over time.\nBefore I discuss the different materials you can use for deck flashing, I think you need to understand the importance of flashing and how it works. Flashings are transitional materials. They connect one thing to something else, always with the sole purpose of preventing water infiltration. Flashings need to be waterproof and permanent. They should last as long as or longer than the adjacent materials.\nIn the case of decks, a flashing is often required where deck lumber contacts the side of a house. The flashing\u2019s job is to prevent water from entering behind the exterior cladding material of the home. If water gets behind brick or stone veneer, wood or vinyl siding or any other exterior surface, it can leak into your home, causing wood rot and mold and mildew nightmares.\nThere are many materials available for flashing a deck to a home, but always keep in mind the power of the UV rays in case any of the flashing material is exposed to direct sunlight. Choose wisely.\nAluminum coil stock is a readily available flashing material. It\u2019s affordable and somewhat easy to work with. Its biggest drawback is that it is not too easy to make waterproof lap joints. Without a permanent sealant or watertight mechanical connection, capillary attraction can easily draw water behind the flashing causing a leak. You can\u2019t solder or weld aluminum with ease. I\u2019m not confident about using any sealant to bond two pieces of aluminum together for decades.\nThin sheet lead is a viable and affordable option. You can purchase it online with no issues in all types of sizes and thicknesses. I prefer to use lead that\u2019s 1/32 inch thick. Lead is waterproof and can last hundreds of years exposed to sunlight. Because lead is malleable, it\u2019s easy to bend. This means you can make just about any shape flashing often using your bare hands and no equipment. You can solder it together if necessary, or you can bend and hammer it to make interlocking flat seams that are highly resistant to water intrusion.\nThe market is flooded with all sorts of flashing membrane tapes not much different than a large roll of duct tape. My issue with these adhesive membrane tapes is their long-term"}

{"idx": "31573", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: What to do about sweltering conditions in public institutions?\nAs summers get hotter, it's hard to argue against the need for more air conditioning. Just look to the children: The AP reported yesterday that some un-air conditioned schools in the Midwest this year have been sending kids home early or not opening at all due to 90-plus degree weather. Not only is the excessive heat making it hard for kids to learn, it's a health hazard: \"I was speaking with teachers yesterday and they said there were students who had to leave early, students with bloody noses, students (who) had fainting spells or fell asleep in the classroom,\" said Chicago state Rep. La Shawn Ford.\nAnd AC is arguably elevated to a basic human right when the focus is put on prisoners, who obviously aren't getting time off on account of heat. In Texas, a lawsuit alleges that sweltering conditions -- upward of 130 degrees Fahrenheit -- were responsible for the deaths of at least 14 inmates. Yesterday, it was reported that the union representing correctional officers has thrown its support behind the suit.\nCranking up the AC, of course, isn't a long-term fix. As Time pointed out at the beginning of the summer, \"Trying to engineer hot weather out of existence rather than adjust our culture of consumption for the age of climate change is one of our biggest environmental blind spots.\" That's because the more we use AC, the more we contribute to the rising temperatures that make frigid air more in demand. Writing here, Henry Grabar promotes the concept of district cooling: Systems of cold-water pipes that city buildings are able to tap into. Until the day that becomes a reality, the Environmental Protect Agency suggests planting trees, using fans and being conservative with the thermostat.\nFor now, though, having readily available water and fans isn't quite cutting it. The main barrier to installing air-conditioning is the cost: The installation estimate for Texas prisons is $55 million, while a Missouri school district had to budget about $5 million to keep students cool. More innovative, sustainable solutions will be expensive, too. But they could end up having fewer costs in the long run, when they'll be needed more than ever."}

Makes sense that the developers might want to put that effort elsewhere. Pools, though? They're just water. How hard could it be?\nI asked producer Graham Nardone why it's so tough to dig a ditch and fill it with water in The Sims 4's new engine, and he broke it down. The short answer? The game's engine, as is, simply isn't built to support things like digging into ground or Sims easily moving up and down within it.\n\"It's easy to look at something and think, 'That looks pretty simple.' When you think about a feature like pools upfront, it looks like a square box on the ground and you put a shader on the top surface and have Sims jump in.\"\n\"But ultimately, it's more complexity in terms of what tech's there and what isn't there, what we have to build to support this. How do we cut down into the terrain, how do we get Sims going through portals across different levels of pools? There's so much that's going on in the background that you don't end up seeing just to have a Sim go swimming.\"\nWill pools get added in eventually, though? Based on all the Sim-trapped-in-pool-esque wailing and gnashing of teeth from fans, it seems pretty darn likely.\n\"It's not a matter of it not being important to us or our focus not being in the right place. As we chat with fans and they continue to inform us of what they want, they're obviously interested in pools and toddlers. They want those in the game. So we'll continue to listen to feedback, something we've always done with The Sims.\"\n\"I'd really just say look at what we've done in the past. We've had a variety of different ways we've delivered content to players, and I think we'll continue to support what they're looking for.\"\nI further asked if the confirmed-but-not-really-explained Sims 4 Premium option might in any way be involved, but again Nardone declined to elaborate. \"That's just not something we're really getting into yet,\" he said. \"Right now we're focused on the base game. Once we're out on September 2nd, we'll start looking toward what's next.\"\nSo there you go. No pools for now, but they might (read: probably will) show up at some point in the future, and they may (or may not) cost money.

{"idx": "31588", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The identified genes can make wheat resistant to stem rust disease, a fungus that threatens to destroy crops.\nResearchers from the University of Minnesota published a study earlier this month exploring a new gene cloning method that would make wheat resistant to a fungus that costs the agriculture industry more than a billion dollars of wheat annually.\nIn the study, University plant pathologist Brian Steffenson used a new cloning method to isolate four genes in wheat that would strongly resist stem rust pathogens. Now that these genes are identified, there is potential to either breed or genetically modify the disease-resistant genes from the wild wheat species into the domesticated species. Farmers plant disease-resistant wheat because it protects against pathogens that threaten to destroy their crops, something that has widespread economic impact.\n\u201cOur goal was to try to identify and clone as many genes as we could from this wild species,\u201d Steffenson said.\nScientists have been developing disease-resistant forms of wheat to minimize crop losses for centuries. However, pathogens typically overcome the disease-resistant genes. The four genes identified by Steffenson and his team would provide stronger resistance to these pathogens. He said there is an extremely small chance the pathogen would overpower the genes.\nRichard Magnusson, a farmer from Roseau, Minnesota, said a fungus destroyed his entire wheat crop in 1993.\nThe fastest, easiest way for this wheat to become available to the public would be through genetic modification, which takes the resistant genes from the wild wheat species and directly inserts them into the domesticated wheat species, Steffenson said. While the disease-resistant wheat could be developed by conventional breeding methods, this typically takes several years while the genetic modification process can be done in about half a year.\nJames Anderson, a professor of wheat breeding at the University, agrees the genetic modification process of creating new varieties of wheat is ideal, but said there is not enough public acceptance of genetically modified wheat.\n\u201cRight now, there are no GMO wheats marketed anywhere in the world,\u201d Anderson said.\nAs a wheat grower, Magnusson sees wheat falling behind with the advancements corn and soybeans are making with genetic modification.\nAccording to United States Department of Agriculture regulations, certified organic growers and handlers are prohibited from using GMOs because it is not something that would be \u201cpossible under natural conditions or processes,\u201d according to the policy. If the gene resistance was bred into the wheat through the traditional methods, organic growers would be able to use it.\nBesides planting varieties bred for disease resistance, many farmers use fungicides to protect their crops. Many fungicides, insecticides and herbicides are prohibited in organic farming.\nIf the genetically modified disease-resistant wheat ever made it to market, David Torgerson, executive director of the Minnesota Wheat Council, said it would benefit farmers and the public.\n\u201cIf our wheat productivity was increased, it would help farmers and our whole economy in Minnesota,\" Torgerson said.\nSteffenson and his team will continue their research in other cereal crops like barley and oats.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated cloning method.

But they could optimize production in ways that reduce the \u201cemissions per product\u201d of what\u2019s edible. Gates has been trying to do that through an investing fund called Breakthrough Energy Ventures that has backed several different kinds of innovation.\nFor instance, both synthetic and natural fertilizers provide plants with nitrogen to help grow, but at an enormous cost from off gassing. Pivot Bio is trying to do the same thing through genetically modified soil microbes. Most crops also get replanted annually, a cycle that strips soils of their nutrients and stops roots from growing long enough to start sucking up carbon dioxide. The Land Institute is helping to develop Kernza, a perennial strain of wheat that helps replenish the soil and is already being planted in some places.\nTwo other ventures, Apeel and Cambridge Crops, address food availability from a different perspective. After all, much of what\u2019s grown now spoils before it can be consumed. These companies create protective, edible coatings that can boost the shelf life of to which they\u2019re applied, and that changes how far the food can travel to reach hungry people, and how long it\u2019ll be available in different markets.\nIn his post, Gates shares a couple other concepts like the collective grain storage initiative from Babban Gona in Nigeria that allows farmers to hold onto their harvests longer with less spoilage and eventually sell them at better rates, and the creation of synthetic palm oil from C16Biosciences using fermentation instead of traditional palm plantations that require massive deforestation. He admits that none of these are a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d but show the kind of thinking that hopefully more philanthropists and companies will back to save the planet.\nNothing will taste great if the entire world becomes an oven. \u201cI wish agricultural innovation got as much attention as the impact on climate change from electricity, because its success is just as critical to stopping climate change,\u201d he says."}

In fact, SwiftKey, an alternative keyboard system for Android-based smartphones, seems like one of the least-necessary apps in the Android ecosystem.\nAfter all, every smartphone comes with a keyboard and at least some rudimentary language technology. Yet Swiftkey--a smartphone keyboard that adapts to how users write and predicts what they want to say--is the top ranked paid app in Google Play and is also licensed by top-tier phone makers, including BlackBerry.\nAt SXSW this past weekend, I caught up with SwiftKey CMO Joe Braidwood in the Austin Hilton lobby to find out what if any traditional marketing the tech company does to get Android users to pony up $3.99 for a better smartphone keyboard. Answer: not much. In fact, his trip to SXSW cost more than any media buy he's made -- and is more effective.\nSwiftKey is one of many mobile startups that, along with Samsung and Google, are plying their wares in Austin, Tex., in a bid to gain to gain traction among early-adopters, tech opinion-makers and agencies. And like the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Apple is nowhere to be seen.\nPaid downloads and licensing helped the SwiftKey's revenue reach seven figures in 2012. SwiftKey's chief competitor Swype was acquired by communication technology company Nuance in October 2011 for more than $100 million as a comparison.\nThis is all despite being shut out of Apple's App Store--iPhone users typically spend far more on apps than Android users--and spending only $20 on promoted Facebook posts and another \"100 quid\" on a recent Adwords campaign. The company's growth can be almost entirely attributed to its community management, its relationship with Google's mobile team and embedding itself with the tech community by way of attending events such as SXSW.\nWhen SwiftKey noticed that one member of its online community was an especially active commenter on its VIP member board, for example, Mr. Braidwood hired him away from his job as a panini waiter to be the company's community manager. Likewise, the company integrates user suggestions into new iterations of its product.\n\"We empower everyone among our elite members to feel like they're really meaningful,\" Mr. Braidwood said. \"They get early access to everything we build and they get to kick the tires on everything we build.\"\nIn SwiftKey's case, this has meant allowing its users to cut down on their finger-tapping time by recognizing their language patterns in various formats, auto-populating text fields accordingly. When posting to a friend's Facebook wall via an Android phone, SwiftKey knows what colloquialisms a user is likely to punch in. Likewise, the keyboard can help users maintain a more professional tone when drafting an office email. One user said that whenever he texts his wife, SwiftKey suggests \"where are you\" before a single letter is typed.\nBut it's the first part--SwiftKey not being allowed to bring its keyboard to the iPhone--that illustrates how Samsung and Google have used SXSW to engender themselves to the members of the mobile tech community that Apple has shunned. Samsung and Google--however complex their relationship may be--have made a point of reaching out to the mobile tech community and allowing them to improve their ecosystem of products while Apple has opted to keep its closed.\n\"What Google"}

(AP) \u2014 The attorney for a West Virginia Supreme Court justice who wrote a book chronicling political corruption in the state and now is on trial tried to cast doubt on the federal government\u2019s belief that Justice Allen Loughry used his office for personal gain.\nAttorney John Carr made his opening remarks at the start of Loughry\u2019s criminal trial Wednesday after a federal judge agreed to a prosecution request to drop three counts in the 25-count indictment.\nMost charges against Loughry involve wire fraud allegations that he used state vehicles and gas cards for personal use. Others contend Loughry made false statements, tampered with witnesses and committed wire fraud.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Philip Wright said each detail of the case is like a piece of a puzzle that will \u201cportray a picture of the fraud the defendant committed.\u201d That includes records for vehicle reservations and fuel purchases, as well as cellphone data to track a person\u2019s location.\nLoughry was suspended from his seat earlier this year after the state Judicial Investigation Commission said he kept secret a December federal subpoena served on the Supreme Court. He was replaced as chief justice in February after the other justices received another subpoena and found out about the first one.\nSeparately, Loughry and three other justices were impeached by the state House of Delegates in August stemming from questions involving lavish renovations to their offices that evolved into accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty.\nOne of those justices, Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge Tuesday in a trial before the state Senate. Loughry and justices Margaret Workman and retired Justice Robin Davis face impeachment trials later. A fifth justice, Menis Ketchum, resigned before impeachment proceedings began.\nIn federal court, Wright said Loughry tried to cover up his conduct, including allegedly planting false facts in conversations with a court official about spending, then reporting his own concerns to a federal prosecutor about others\u2019 spending in the court.\nLoughry, in consultation with the other justices, had constitutional autonomy in deciding how the court system spends a $139 million annual budget. But a proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot would give the Legislature more budgetary control over the judiciary.\nLoughry has repeatedly denied involvement in renovations to his office which cost $353,000 and included a $32,000 blue suede couch and a $7,500 wood-inlay floor map of West Virginia. He made one such denial to the House Committee on Finance in January. He blamed the spending on former court administrator Steve Canterbury, whom he fired in January 2017.\nOne of the criminal counts accuses Loughry of lying when he told an FBI agent he didn\u2019t know the desk he had transferred to his house had historical significance and value, determined to be $42,000.\nLoughry returned the desk after news outlets asked about it.\n\u201cHe willfully lied about matters under investigation,\u201d Wright said.\nThat includes Loughry allegedly planting false facts with a Supreme Court employee during a meeting about court spending, then going directly to a federal prosecutor to report his own concerns about spending by others in the court, Wright said.\nAccording to state records, Loughry signed for a state car for a total of 212 days from 2013 to 2015 but failed to list a destination for 148 days, including trips to visit family and for signings of his 2"}

The surge of private equity money into the movie business a few years back has dried up because returns were uneven and often lower than promised.\n\"This product could help to even out the volatility of the movie business,\" said Clark Hallren, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. entertainment banker who is consulting for Veriana.\nAlthough the backers say the main purpose of the exchanges is to reduce risk, it could also allow a lucky speculator to profit enormously by betting the long odds on a dark horse. For example, someone who bought a contract for the seemingly unlikely outcome that \"The Hangover,\" last summer's raunchy comedy, would be a blockbuster could have made a killing.\nBut the markets, some say, could be subject to conflicts of interest and manipulation by Hollywood insiders. If someone involved in a film saw the results of a test screening or knew how much would be spent on marketing, for instance, he or she might have a big leg up over the public.\n\"Insider trading seems like it would be a non-trivial issue,\" said Isaac Palmer, managing director of media and entertainment investment bank Mesa. \"If a studio is hedging a bet on its own movie, wouldn't that be insider trading by definition?\"\nCantor and Veriana say they plan to guard against conflicts of interest by collecting employment information about each user of their exchanges, closely monitoring big trades and limiting the amount that investors in a specific production can invest in its box office.\nThe bigger question, however, is whether Cantor and Veriana can persuade professionals in the insular entertainment business to adopt the type of complex financial tool that, as evidenced by the recent mortgage meltdown, doesn't always work smoothly.\n\"Obviously the futures industry is new to film, but I look at what it did to the energy market and the agricultural market,\" said Richard Jaycobs, who is overseeing the Cantor Exchange after working at a number of futures markets. \"There will be a whole bunch of strategies that"}

When we saw him again he was looking straight ahead, not smiling, as he proceeded down the aisle with a fellow graduate, her arm looped in his, the notes of \u201cPomp and Circumstance\u201d ringing through the air.\nAfter the ceremony, I thanked his principal for her contribution to his education. She is retiring this year, and so she said a few things about how much she has enjoyed being an educator, and then she said, \u201cEverett\u2019s going to be all right, you know,\u201d and I could tell she meant it. A few minutes later, his science teacher told me the same thing.\nThe next day, I asked Everett if he wanted to display his robe in his room. He did.\n\u201cDo you think we could also get my diploma framed?\u201d he asked.\nIt was only then that I fully understood how important graduating had been to him all along.\nIt occurs to me as I write this that my son\u2019s graduation is the product of a long line of teachers, office, staff, administrators, and classified personnel, all of them working together over the past nine years to help Everett get through. They did not always realize how important their jobs were to my son, and I\u2019m quite sure Everett rarely expressed his gratitude to any of them.\nBut the bus driver who picked him up and returned him home every school day for the past nine years, the teachers who persevered even when he did everything he could to make them leave him alone, the secretary who loaned him her office for a quiet place to make up assignments during the final weeks of his eighth grade year \u2013 each were with him when Everett, a newly minted freshman, walked off the stage on June 4. He will not know this for a long time, and maybe he will never realize it, but I do, and I will always be grateful.\nGraduation ceremonies commemorate the past while embracing the future, and so now we are looking forward to Everett\u2019s high school years. When he begins school in the fall, our son will participate in the Advancement Via Individual Determination program. It is hard to say whose individual determination the program hopes to tap, since our son is not powered by an overabundance of intrinsic motivation.\nStill, applying for the AVID program was his idea, and he approached the interview process with a solemn commitment he has not exhibited in other academic endeavors, so I was both impressed by his initiative and proud that he did well enough in the required interview to be accepted into AVID. The program has a good reputation.\nJune 4 was an evening of hope, and that sense of possibility has not yet abated. Perhaps AVID will help to get my son through high school, and perhaps not. Maybe a sport will get him through, or maybe he will somehow hold on to that moment he walked across the stage at the end of his eighth-grade year, and that will propel him toward another graduation. In any case, at least for now, I believe he will be all right. His future seems filled with possibilities."}

It's appropriate to call yesterday a milestone in the SAR's fight against environmental pollution.\nBut success of the program hinges on how quickly old appliances can be collected from households and reprocessed at the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Treatment and Recycling Facility in Tuen Mun, which became fully operational in March.\nA failure to collect waste like refrigerators or computers efficiently could deal a blow to the ambitious scheme.\nThe concern is justified because some retailers of electrical goods have warned there's only one recycling contractor, and consumers would have to keep their old equipment for several days before they will be removed.\nIf that's the situation, this would form a bottleneck - potentially a problem that Secretary of the Environment Wong Kam-sing must tackle.\nIt's timely to take the right step, since the city can no longer depend on sending waste to the mainland, as they are no longer welcome there either. The SAR must look internally to solve its annual production of 70,000 tonnes of electrical and electronic waste.\nThe final piece of the regulation was passed in 2017. A year has passed and the trade can't say the government hasn't given them enough time to prepare for the changes.\nThey involve two key features.\nFirst, suppliers must be registered with the authority and pay a recycling levy for every air-conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine, television, computer, printer, scanner and monitor sold. The levy varies from HK$15 to HK$165.\nSecond, vendors are required to remove old appliances from their customers for free in accordance with plans preapproved by the authority. The abandoned items will be collected by contractor.\nThe plan is as good as it sounds. However, there are problems. As said, the need to wait at least three days before a family can dispose of an old electrical or electronic appliance is undesirable. That can be a nuisance for families living in tight quarters. Will the old items be dumped all over the streets as a result?\nIt will be essential to introduce additional recycling contractors to shorten the wait. Ideally, it would be great if an old appliance is removed at the same time the new purchase is delivered.\nThere is also growing concern merchants are passing the entirety of the levy - which is supposed to reflect on their responsibility as waste producers - onto customers. On the first day of the scheme's implementation, it was reported some irresponsible traders raised the prices by HK$200 to HK$300, which is way above the levy.\nThat's an unfair and unethical departure from the spirit underlying the policy.\nWhen businesses on different tiers of the chain make profit from the sale, wouldn't it be more fair for them to share the extra cost too? It was plain dumb of Wong to defend the trade's swift move to jack up the prices."}

Here is how the Union Square Partnership is doing it \u2014 and how you can help.\nThe Union Square Partnership spends a third of its budget \u2014 over $1 million \u2014 annually on managing waste in Union Square Park. It's looking to change that with several new programs to help meet the city's zero waste by 2030 goal.\nUrban parks are a necessary haven from the hustle of city life. But being in one of the busiest business districts of New York City, as Union Square Park is, means the problems of city life also come into the park \u2014 especially garbage. So how can a park stay green? That\u2019s the question the Union Square Partnership, a business improvement district nonprofit, set out to answer on its mission to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s OneNYC goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.\nFinding the answers would involve thinking as small as a straw and as big as who collects the neighborhood\u2019s trash, and working with businesses as well as the people passing through.\nAbout a year ago Union Square Partnership hired Monica Munn, who\u2019s had a long career in urban sustainability and public policy at the Rockefeller Foundation, as its director of economic development. She also lived on 14th Street for six years, with a walking commute to the Flatiron District that took her through Union Square Park every day, an area she sees as ideal for trying out waste-reduction experiments that could apply in the rest of the city.\nWaste is an issue that comes up frequently in the partnership\u2019s annual community opinion survey. Besides being an eyesore, trash bags can block or leak into bike lanes and attract pests. Not to mention the Union Square Partnership spends a third of its budget on sanitation services, more than $1 million per year.\nSo to find out what was being thrown away, Munn enlisted the help of graduate students in Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute, who dug through 600 pounds of trash collected in and around Union Square over three days in April 2018. Their findings were startling: 84% could be recycled or composted; the biggest culprits were mixed paper (23%), hard plastics (17%) and food scraps (15%).\nWith that information, Munn and her team started working on solutions and reaching out to businesses in the Union Square district with ideas both small and large to get to zero waste.\nThis summer\u2019s movement to get rid of plastic straws tied neatly into their campaign, as does the locavore movement of eating food that\u2019s grown as close as possible to where it\u2019s eaten \u2014 Union Square hosts the GrowNYC greenmarket four days a week \u2014 and the ongoing fight to ban styrofoam containers as well as plastic bags.\nPlenty is already being done by existing businesses, too.

The Lhasa riots of 14 March 2008 claimed several innocent Chinese lives and the destruction of many properties and businesses. But the Chinese public should not be blinded from an understanding of the wellsprings of the protest.\nWhenever there is any domestic turmoil in China, the government's instinctive response is always to lay the blame on external anti-Chinese influences \"meddling in China's internal affairs\". Yet it is very clear that the Dalai Lama has played no direct role in instigating the current wave of riots and demonstrations across the Tibetan plateau. It is, rather, the Chinese government's refusal to respect Tibetan aspirations with regard to the return of their leader that is is one root cause of the present unrest.\nWhat has given this outbreak of protest such a violent and ethnically antagonistic dimension is that in many parts of the Tibetan plateau - which are undergoing rapid economic development - Tibetans are rapidly and reluctantly becoming a minority in their own ancestral homelands, in much the same way as Mongolians have already become an almost negligible minority in the equally \"autonomous\" Chinese province of Inner Mongolia. The central government is well aware that once outnumbered by Chinese immigrants, Tibetan nationalism will become, of necessity, an unviable anachronism, and the Tibetans will be forced to accept the status that the Chinese have always assigned to them - as inalienable members of the \"big family\" of the Chinese motherland.\nTibetans themselves are also acutely aware that in-migration to their lands and the establishment of Chinese economic concerns pose the greatest threats to the continuance of their culture, and these are therefore the primary targets of the protests. Despite rising levels of material livelihood, Tibetans across the plateau are experiencing a sense of colonial disenfranchisement and an increasing distance from their once-sacred and animate environment, which in traditional culture imbued life with value and meaning.\nThe fact that spontaneous protests have erupted across the Tibetan plateau, from Lhasa to the borderlands of Amdo and Kham (in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces) marks the belated coming-of-age of a pan-Tibetan nationalism. In the past there was no Tibetan name, aside from khawachen gi yul (the \"land of snows\") to describe the entire Tibetan cultural world. The Tibetan name from which the name \"Tibet\" is derived, Bod (pronounced p\u00f6) referred only to the central Tibetan provinces of U and Tsang, while excluding the more populous Tibetan cultural and linguistic regions of Kham and Amdo, whose loose governance was traditionally divided between many independent and semi-independent statelets and principalities, which were somewhat culturally and socially integrated with central Tibet through the system of federative monasticism.\nIndeed, it was the coming of the Chinese communist regime that unwittingly fostered a sense of pan-Tibetan identity - a reaction both to the encounter with \"the other\" in the form of the Han and Hui (Muslim) Chinese, and to the implementation of the CCP's nationalities policy, based on the Soviet model, in which Tibetans of all regional shades are classified, quite correctly, as a single Tibetan nationality (minzu - these days more often translated in Chinese government documents as"}

If you already have AMD, such a lifestyle may help protect your remaining vision. Here are hints on how.\nDon\u2019t Smoke. Smokers are more than twice as likely as nonsmokers to get AMD. Smoking narrows the blood vessels, reducing blood supply to the eyes. If you smoke, make a plan to quit with your doctor\u2019s help.\nExercise Regularly. Exercise may reduce inflammation, which is a key contributor to AMD. It can also help lower eye pressure, which improves blood flow to the retina and optic nerve.\nEat a Varied and Nutritious Diet. Both your eye health and your overall health benefit from a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, including dark leafy greens, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, fish, and whole grains.\nMaintain Normal Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels. High blood pressure narrows the blood vessels that nourish the retina. Cholesterol deposits in the eye contribute to AMD.\nMaintain a Healthy Weight. Being overweight contributes to AMD and increases your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Develop a healthy diet and lifestyle plan.\nProtect Your Eyes Outdoors. Sunlight exposure may increase the risk of AMD. Wear wide-brimmed hats when outdoors and use high-quality sunglasses with a UVA and UVB rating of 99 to 100 percent.\nKeep Track of Your Eye Health. It\u2019s important to monitor your vision, to help with early detection of eye problems or to slow the progression of AMD. Schedule regular, comprehensive eye exams with your eye doctor. More than a vision test, the exam should include pupil dilation to detect diseases, and the use of tonometry, which measures eye fluid pressure.\nAsk your doctor how often you should schedule exams, based on your risk factors. These include a family history of AMD and being over age 60.\nFor further eye care advice, you can download The Top Five Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor and other free vision resources at www.brightfocus.org/eye-health, or call (800) 437-2423.\nBrightFocus Foundation is a premier source of research funding to defeat Alzheimer\u2019s, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, investing in bold, innovative science to find the cures for diseases of mind and sight."}

Is the government deliberately making life harder for local trading and services firms \u2013 and thereby, causing the cost of living in the country to climb?\nSeems so. Giant export companies with lots of employees are the alpha dog when it comes to government incentives, and if the giant is a multinational that's based overseas, all the better. These are the types of corporate entities \u2013 the ones that undertake to export a lot, and also employ a lot \u2013 that are boosted by the state through the Investment Encouragement Law.\nThe encouragement takes the form of tax breaks or outright grants, or both. The recipients of such largesse over the years include the likes of Intel, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel Chemicals and Check Point Software Technologies. All of them huge, powerful export companies.\nOn top of the candy they have already received, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon is moving to lower their corporate tax to an especially low 6%. Regular corporate tax in the country is 25%, but in practice, many high-tech companies pay less, because of the Investment Encouragement Law (which applies to companies with revenues greater than 10 billion shekels, or about $2.6 billion, a year). They also pay lowered dividend tax of just 4%.\nIt is easy to find rationale for being generous to multinational high-tech companies: The idea is to attract them to Israel.\nThe phrase \u201chigh-tech\u201d evokes images of global corporations, international conventions, terrific employment conditions, keyboards being tapped in air-conditioned rooms, exports. It\u2019s easier to envision the future there than in greasy metal workshops or tomato-canning factories. We\u2019d all prefer to see the kids working in gorgeously designed work spaces with free espresso. But most Israelis don\u2019t work in places like that.\nLast week the chief economist at the treasury reported that the multinationals operating in Israel achieve better productivity than local companies do. It makes sense. The companies that come here are at the forefront of technology, selling advanced products and services. They are highly productive, and would inevitably win in a contest in that realm against virtually \u201call\u201d Israeli industry, which includes high-tech and low-tech as well.\nThe system of incentives leads to a single conclusion: The state lavishes its largesse mainly on the strong and powerful. There are explanations, some Darwinistic: the strong win, and the winner takes all. If they\u2019re so good at making products or services, they\u2019re probably great at wresting perks from governments, too. They want to make money and the government wants jobs to be created and more exports, and likes the fact that they bump up the quality of the labor force in Israel.\nMultinationals have alternatives. They don\u2019t have to work in Israel. They need wooing. But wooing them means that the government is neglecting local companies. Absent incentives to grow more efficient and to improve their productivity, the local entities keep lagging behind. Their workers do not improve, and neither does their equipment, resulting in high prices that jack up the cost of living in Israel.\nZvi Eckstein, dean at the Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya, has been pushing for the government to change its policy on prioritizing exporters.

{"idx": "31626", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: After a day of speculation, automaker Ford has announced a significant regime change to underscore its ambitions in connected and self-driving cars: Jim Hackett \u2014 who had been running Ford\u2019s Smart Mobility business \u2014 is taking over as the company\u2019s CEO, replacing Mark Fields, who is retiring.\nThe move is a bold attempt to push Ford into what many see as the next generation of auto-making. This is an area Ford has been criticised for not attacking as well as competitors like GM (which has invested in and works with companies like Lyft, acquired startups like Cruise, and started new initiatives like car-sharing service Maven); and upstarts like Tesla \u2014 never mind the likes of Google and Uber. Ford\u2019s stock price, which is lingering around $11 at the moment, is significantly down from lofty heights of $36, which it hit in 1999-2000, right before a huge downturn.\nIt is therefore no surprise that during a press conference announcing the news today, Chairman Bill Ford compared Hackett several times to Alan Mulally, who was Ford\u2019s CEO from 2006 to 2014 and helped bring Ford out of its last slump and back into profitability.\nHackett is thought of as a turnaround specialist: he spent a long period as the CEO of Steelcase, turning it around from a mundane office furniture maker into one whose products essentially evolved with the changing pace of work (for example, from closed, individual offices into open-plan spaces), and also how the products were made.\nBoth of those challenges have analogous cases in today\u2019s auto industry \u2014 which is straddling two worlds where cars are either seen as dinosaurs or the next great piece of connected hardware. The hope is that he will be able to apply some of his proven Steelcase magic to Ford.\nIn the press conference today, Hackett (pictured above on the left, with Ford chairman Bill Ford on the right) likened the auto industry landscape today as a \u201cRubik\u2019s Cube.\u201d This underscores some of the bigger challenges of how fixing one thing could create problems elsewhere, and that sometimes the moves might not look logical if you do not now the bigger picture.\nHe also seemed to caution that there needs to be patience around the new leadership: there is still some planning and strategy that needs to be decided before it is announced.\nFord added that Hackett will be focusing on operational changes, and more product launches; weeding out unprofitable areas and modernizing the business around new innovations around big data, AI, robotics and so on; and focusing on culture changes.\nThis is not to say that Ford has totally been out of the loop when it comes to focusing on next-generation services and plans. They include last year\u2019s acquisition of SAIPS for self-driving tech and Chariot for its smart city transit strategy. And earlier this year, it invested $1 billion in Argo AI to further drive its autonomous car business. The bigger issue now is how these investments and acquisitions will be utilised in the longer term.\nNotably, Ford very much believes that what it needs to do \u2014 and perhaps what the market needs to hear \u2014 is that it\u2019s not a rusty old car maker, but essentially a hardware maker of the future. As part of that, chairman Ford highlighted how Hackett was lauded and greeted warmly by Silicon Valley when they once made a trip there together several years ago, when he was on the board before taking an executive role.\nIn addition to Hackett, there were some other changes.

The Initiative aims to inform the national health care debate with rigorous, evidence-based analysis leading to practical recommendations using the collaborative strengths of USC and Brookings.\nVinod Khosla, a legendary Silicon Valley investor, argues that robots will replace doctors by 2035. And there is some evidence that he may be right.\nA 2017 study out of the Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) system was equal or better than radiologists at reading mammograms for high risk cancer lesions needing surgery. A year earlier, and reported by the Journal of the American Medical Association, Google showed that computers are similar to ophthalmologists at examining retinal images of diabetics. And recently, computer-controlled robots performed intestinal surgery successfully on a pig. While the robot took longer than a human, its sutures were much better\u2014more precise and uniform with fewer chances for breakage, leakage, and infection. Tech boosters believe that AI will lead to more evidence-based care, more personalized care, and fewer errors.\nOf course, improving diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes are laudable goals. But AI is only as good as the humans programming it and the system in which it operates. If we are not careful, AI could not make health care better, but instead unintentionally exacerbate many of the worst aspects of our current health care system.\nUsing deep and machine learning, AI systems analyze enormous amounts of data to make predictions and recommend interventions. Advances in computing power have enabled the creation and cost-effective analysis of large datasets of payer claims, electronic health record data, medical images, genetic data, laboratory data, prescription data, clinical emails, and patient demographic information to power AI models.\nAI is 100 percent dependent on this data, and as with everything in computing, \u201cgarbage in, garbage out,\u201d as the saying goes. A major concern about all our health care datasets is that they perfectly record a history of unjustified and unjust disparities in access, treatments, and outcomes across the United States.\nAccording to a 2017 report by the National Academy of Medicine on health care disparities , non-whites continue to experience worse outcomes for infant mortality, obesity, heart disease, cancer, stroke, HIV/AIDS, and overall mortality. Shockingly, Alaskan Natives suffer from 60 percent higher infant mortality than whites. And worse, AIDS mortality for African Americans is actually increasing. Even among whites, there are substantial geographic differences in outcomes and mortality. Biases based on socioeconomic status may be exacerbated by incorporating patient generated data from expensive sensors, phones, and social media.\nThe data we are using to train our AI models could lead to results that perpetuate\u2014and even exacerbate\u2014rather than remedy these stubborn disparities. The machines do not and cannot verify the accuracy of the underlying data they are given.

Some have double-dosed, and others have taken the wrong medicine altogether.\nThe result: the rate of serious mix-ups has doubled since 2000, a new study reports.\nFour out of 10 mistakes involve heart medications, painkillers or hormone therapy prescriptions, including insulin. And the errors often put patients in the hospital, the study found.\n\"Ever more drugs for ever more diagnoses in ever more people invites ever more error and adverse reactions,\" said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. He was not involved with the study.\nThe study researchers used U.S. National Poison Data System records to track errors involving prescription or over-the-counter medications taken outside a health care facility. Most of the drugs were taken at home, meaning patients, not health care professionals, made the mistakes.\nThe rate of serious medication errors rose from 1.09 for every 100,000 Americans in 2000 to 2.28 per 100,000 by 2012. One-third of the cases resulted in a hospital stay, the researchers said.\n\"Fortunately, most do not result in the serious outcomes found in this study,\" said lead author Nichole Hodges. She is a research scientist with the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\nBut Hodges said the extent of the problem may be worse than the findings suggest.\n\"Because this study includes only medication errors reported to poison control centers, it is an underestimate of the true number of serious medication errors in the U.S.,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, we can't tell from the data whether serious medication errors are occurring more frequently, or whether they are simply being reported more often.\"\nNationwide, at least 1.5 million medication errors occur every year, with poison control centers logging them at a rate of one every 21 seconds.\nThe study found medication errors outside a medical facility shot up across all age ranges except one: children under age 6.\nAmong that young group, errors rose between 2000 and 2005, then started to fall. The study pointed to less use of pediatric cough and cold medicines after 2007, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised parents to stop giving those drugs to children.\nMost of the errors involved taking the wrong medicine, the wrong dosage or accidentally taking a medication twice.\nTwo-thirds of deaths in the study involved heart medicines and painkillers combined.\nHeart medication mistakes accounted for more than a fifth of errors, while hormone therapy drugs such as insulin accounted for 11 percent.\nPainkillers were involved in 12 percent of poisonings, and roughly 80 percent of painkiller mistakes involved products with acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or an opioid drug.\nHodges said most medication mistakes can be prevented.\n\"Keeping a written log of when medications are administered can be a helpful strategy for parents and caregivers,\" she said. \"This is especially important if multiple individuals are administering medication to an individual.\"\nHodges said patients should to talk to their doctor or pharmacist if they have questions about their medicines.

Simultaneously, she was a committed Democrat, serving 11 years on University Heights City Council, the last three as vice mayor. Two years ago, Goldberg realized her political dream of becoming a judge when she was elected to the county's Domestic Relations bench to finish out the term of the late Judge Kathleen O'Malley.\nOur editorial board in that 2014 race endorsed her opponent, but Goldberg, 52, has shown herself to be an effective and energetic Domestic Relations judge.\nGoldberg has dived into the regular work of the court while also embracing needed reforms, such as a pilot project for e-filing. She implemented a Wall of Happiness to recognize that divorce need not be an all-out war. She advocates such innovations as kiosks in the courthouse to pay child support and using Skype conferences to cut down on time-consuming and frustrating visits to the courthouse because of local parking woes.\nGoldberg is opposed by longtime local divorce lawyer John Mayer, 58, a Republican who has run unsuccessfully for judge several times, including one bid for Parma Municipal Court and two earlier tries at the Domestic Relations bench. Two years ago, he lost in the GOP primary for this same seat. He's experienced and congenial, with a practical approach to the issues of the court, and is very focused on wanting to make the experience less traumatic for litigants, but he lacks dynamic ideas for the future.\nIn the Judge4Yourself ratings by four local bar associations, Goldberg was rated \"good\" by all four and Mayer as \"adequate\" by three, but he was \"not recommended\" by the Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association.\nThe county's Domestic Relations bench is currently all-female. Out of three contested races, Mayer is the only man running for Domestic Relations Court this year. However, he says such a consideration is not driving his candidacy and that any such biases can cut both ways.\nOur editorial board asked candidates in all three contested Domestic Relations judicial races about the perceived gender imbalance on the bench and no candidate felt it was an issue for the court. Judge Diane M. Palos, who served as the Domestic Relations Court's administrative judge from 2010-2015, said that in her courtroom, she is seeing a narrowing of the salary gap between sexes and a notable increase in women paying support.\nIn a time of change at Domestic Relations Court, Francine Goldberg has the ability and focus to continue to innovate to make the court work better.

If you want a stylish, put-together look for your master bedroom, however, it requires a little more planning. You need a focused design that blends color, pattern and texture effectively and allows for organization that keeps the room neat.\nFor your bedroom to have a neat, stylish look, a focal point is key. Typically, the bed should take center stage in your bedroom. You can draw attention to it by choosing a striking headboard \u2013 an upholstered style with fabric that has a striking pattern or texture is ideal, but you may also opt for a wooden headboard with intricate carving detail. If your bed doesn't have a headboard, decorate the wall behind it to draw attention. Painting it in a bold color that contrasts with the rest of the walls is an easy, inexpensive way to add drama. You can also use wallpaper or stencils to add a pattern to the wall. Even a large piece of artwork or a series of smaller pieces hung together can help establish your bed as the room's focal point.\nSelecting a wall color for your bedroom is personal decision \u2013 whether you prefer warm or cool colors, dark or light, virtually any color can work in the space if you choose the right shade. To give your bedroom a chic, put together look, however, don't rely on one or two colors to do all the work. Instead, choose a series of colors with similar undertones and layer them throughout the decor. You can also add accents in a color with a different undertone to create a striking contrast for the room. For example, since red, yellow and orange are all warm tones, you might use a soft butter shade for the walls, add curtains in a muted brick tone and cover the bed with a comforter that has a terracotta, brick and gold pattern. For that unexpected pop of color, add a lamp with a blue or green design to contrast with the warm tones. Mix in a few neutrals like ivory and walnut, and you'll have rich, balanced look for your bedroom.\nIn any room, it's the small details that really help pull the design together. Take care when selecting accessories for your bedroom. Use small items like throw pillows and lampshades to add a bold pop of color or pattern. Larger accessories like window treatments or area rugs are ideal spots to reinforce the dominant tones in your color scheme. Think about the texture of your accessories too \u2013 mix different fabrics like a leather-upholstered headboard with velvet and satin throw pillows for a striking contrast that adds plenty of style to your bedroom.\nNo matter how you decorate your bedroom, the space won\u2019t feel put together if it\u2019s cluttered and messy. Incorporate plenty of convenient storage options so you can organize your belongings and prevent clutter. If you have a habit of just tossing your cellphone, keys, sunglasses or other small items down as soon as you enter the room, place a decorative basket or bowl on your dresser or bedside table to get in the habit of dropping things there. Under-bed storage is an efficient way to hide away certain items \u2013 purchase plastic or canvas boxes that fit under you mattress to hold shoes, seasonal clothing or other items. Keep a laundry basket or hamper in your closet or bathroom so you aren\u2019t tempted to drop your dirty clothing on the floor.\nBlair, Jennifer. \"How to Make Your Bedroom Look Put Together.\" Home Guides | SF Gate,"}

But as a political and legal enterprise, California hangs dangerously on the brink of financial and economic collapse.\nCalifornia\u2019s state government debt rose by about $5 billion to $617 billion during the last year, with no signs of a turnaround. One after the other, California cities are falling to bankruptcy like dominoes. Stockton, Vallejo, Mammoth Lakes and San Bernardino have already gone insolvent, and now Compton is expected to run out of money soon. Some are saying this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nCities like these are in fiscal trouble because the government (both local and state) spends more than it takes in and then raises taxes in a vain effort to make up the difference. With government employee pensions skyrocketing, high unemployment compensation debt and an increasing amount of taxpaying businesses fleeing the state, California is learning a hard lesson in fiscal responsibility.\nThe entire state government has failed to take the issue of generous defined-benefit pensions seriously, which now consume increasingly large chunks of the government\u2019s budget. Gov. Jerry Brown recently announced a pension reform plan, but advocates for more fiscal responsibility are calling the effort underwhelming as many more cuts need to be made. The governor\u2019s proposal is estimated to save between $40 and $60 billion over the next 30 years, but critics argue that it should be much more.\nNot only is California experiencing pension deficits, but the amount of money the state owes the rest of American taxpayers for cash borrowed from the Feds to pay Californians unemployment payments is shocking and unfair to the rest of the nation. California uniquely owes the federal government more than $9 billion for unemployment compensation. No other state owes nearly that much for this one program; in fact, the combined debt of 45 other states totals only $7 billion. The State Legislative Analyst Office estimates that California will have to pay $3 billion over the next 10 years in interest alone for these borrowed funds.\nIn any event, the unexplained Obama Administration\u2019s charity to California doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. The unemployment rate of 10.7 percent remains the third highest in the United States, and is more than two percentage points above the national rate of 8.3 percent. California has also lost some 855,200 private sector jobs since 2008.\nCalifornia workers might find it harder to find jobs because so many businesses are fleeing the state to find more economic stability. California ranks as the third worst state in the country in terms of job migration with a net outflow of jobs that is one percentage point greater than the flow of jobs into the state. When comparing the ratio of jobs created by new businesses compared to jobs eliminated by firms going under, California ranks 34th. It\u2019s also hard for entrepreneurs to start new businesses in California. In Texas it only takes six weeks to open a restaurant; in California it takes two years! Even \u201cgreen\u201d companies are leaving: Cereplast Inc., a maker of renewable plastics, announced it was leaving California to move to Indiana to reduce its real estate and utility costs.\nAnd California\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d agenda isn\u2019t helping its economy either.

If not, maybe you should be.\nWelcome to \u201cSocial Security Q&A.\u201d You ask a Social Security question, and our guest expert provides the answer.\nYou can learn how to ask a question of your own below. And if you would like a personalized report detailing your optimal Social Security claiming strategy, click here. Check it out: It could result in you receiving thousands of dollars more in benefits over your lifetime!\nI am thinking about starting to collect Social Security in a one year and four months, when I turn 66. I am still working and have no retirement to speak of. Would it be wise to take Social Security while I am still working and invest it, or would the tax consequences be too high? My salary will be about $32,000 a year. I am also a widow and my husband did not qualify for Social Security.\nJackie, there are many aspects to your question, which is why it is often difficult to decide when to start taking Social Security benefits. Here are some things to consider.\nFirst, if you begin taking Social Security before your full retirement age, 66, Social Security will reduce your benefit if you earn more than $17,040 this year. If you wait until the calendar year in which you reach your full retirement age, then you can earn $45,360 before your benefits will be reduced.\nAfter reaching full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want without any reduction. So, given your present salary, if you wait until that age before taking benefits, your benefits will not be reduced even if you continue working.\nSecond, your Social Security benefits increase each month that you delay taking them. For single people, full retirement age is not a magic number. Each year you delay them after full retirement age, benefits increase by 8 percent a year until you reach 70. If you have limited savings and you do not need your benefits immediately, this may be your last opportunity to really increase your income in retirement.\nYou said your earnings are about $32,000 and you have little in savings. Let\u2019s suppose that your interest income is $400 a year. Then, your adjusted gross income would be $32,400.\nIf your Social Security benefits are $700 per month, then your annual benefit would be $8,400. Your combined income would then be $32,400 + \u00bd ($8,400) = $36,600. This is greater than $34,000, so 85 percent ($7,140) of your Social Security benefits would be taxed.\nIf you stopped working \u2014 or work only part-time so that your salary drops below $20,000 \u2014 none of your Social Security benefits would be taxed because your combined income would drop below $25,000.\nAs you can see, there are many factors that can influence your retirement income. But perhaps the most important thing is to recognize that delayed claiming can increase your future benefits.\nI hold a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and taught economics at the University of Delaware for many years. I now do the same at Gallaudet University.\nIn 2009, I co-founded SocialSecurityChoices.com, an internet company that provides advice on Social Security claiming decisions.

New indications and formulation developments of existing drugs are granted three years of exclusivity, and a six-month extension of patent or data exclusivity is granted if a drug is approved for use in pediatric populations.\nIn 2007, the National Academies Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy called for extending this \u201cdata exclusivity\u201d term to the longer period used in Europe, ten to 11 years. But generic manufacturers have argued for shorter limits so that they can bring less expensive versions of drugs to patients sooner.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the health policy literature contains no information about the effects such a policy would have on innovation, population longevity and social welfare,\u201d said Darius Lakdawalla, research director at the Schaeffer Center at USC and associate professor in the USC School of Policy, Planning and Development.\nIn the first study to directly address these issues, the researchers estimate that extending the term of data exclusivity to 12 years would increase the lifetime revenue of a drug by 5 percent, on average.\nWith empirical evidence that profits drive drug innovation, this longer term would lead to an additional 228 drug approvals over the next fifty years and an increase of 1.7 months in average life expectancy, according to the study.\nJesse D. Malkin at Precision Health Economics and Tomas Philipson of the University of Chicago are also authors on the study. The research was sponsored by the National Institute on Aging through its support of the Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation and INTERPAT, an association of research-based pharmaceutical companies.\nThe Schaffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC is a collaboration between the USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development and the USC School of Pharmacy.\nGoldman et al., \u201cThe Benefits from Giving Makers of Conventional \u2018Small Molecule\u2019 Drugs Longer Exclusivity Over Clinical Trial Data.\u201d Health Affairs: January 2011."}

He was eventually arrested and charged with first-degree murder, tampering with a witness, aggravated assault, unlawful flight and criminal damage.\nOver the course of two and a half years, those charges were whittled down to just one (and the most severe): first-degree murder. If found guilty of such a charge, Quiroz would have faced 25 years to life in prison.\nInstead, Quiroz has now been determined not guilty by a jury and released from custody. The verdict was announced just a few hours after the defense and prosecution gave their closing statements.\nRepresenting the State of Arizona, Yavapai County attorney Steve Young closed by going over the key aspects of the case that supported his argument.\nNamely, he said Quiroz had no alibi for the time of the murder; he owned a 12-gauge shotgun around that time (the type used to kill Calderon); that shotgun mysteriously disappeared the night of the murder, according to testimony from his girlfriend; Quiroz fled the state with his brother the morning after the murder without explaining to his girlfriend why he was leaving; and he repeatedly told his girlfriend in recorded telephonic conversations to lie to the police about when he left the state and why he decided to leave.\n\u201cCommon sense tells you, you don\u2019t have to have someone lie on your behalf unless you\u2019re the murderer or you\u2019re involved in that murder as an accomplice,\u201d Young told the jury.\nThe defense, headed by private defense attorney Ryan Stevens of Griffen & Stevens Law Firm, rebutted Young\u2019s accusations by reinforcing what he had been pushing throughout the 11-day trial: the state\u2019s argument was based on circumstantial evidence.\nStevens\u2019 argument included pointing out Quiroz had no clear motive to murder Calderon; none of the witnesses could identify Quiroz as being at the scene of the crime; there were multiple leads during the investigation that could have been further vetted (thus, leaving open the possibility of finding another prime suspect to arrest and charge); and there was no evidence found that directly links Quiroz to having committed the crime.\n\u201cFrom Gabe\u2019s world over here and Richie\u2019s world over here, there is not one ounce of evidence to support a connection,\u201d Stevens told the jury.\nBy law, it is up to the prosecution to carry the burden of proof. This means the state had to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Quiroz decided to kill Calderon with the previous intention of doing so.\nThe jury made the final decision to let Quiroz go, after deliberating within three hours.\nOverseeing the case was Yavapai County Superior Court judge Tina Ainley."}

The judge will then determine whether to send the case to trial.\nLegal analysts say that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may well accept a plea agreement before trial. In such cases, the preliminary hearing can set the stage for a deal by letting each side assess the other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\nPreliminary hearings \u201care often the first step to resolving the case, a mini-trial so both sides can see the writing on the wall,\u201d Levenson said.\nJudges rarely throw out a case at this stage because prosecutors must only meet a \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard \u2013 much lower than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for a guilty verdict at trial, said Mimi Wesson, a professor of law at the University of Colorado Law School.\nHolmes, who faces more than 160 counts including first-degree murder and attempted murder, could have waived his right to a preliminary hearing, allowing lawyers on both sides to prepare for trial.\nBut defense lawyers sometimes go through with the hearing because it gives them a clearer picture of prosecution evidence.\n\u201cIn this case, I think it likely that the genuine purpose of the hearing would be information-gathering by the defense,\u201d Wesson said.\nCourt officials expect many survivors and family members of the dead to attend the preliminary hearing, along with scores of spectators and reporters. At least two overflow rooms are being prepared where the hearing can be observed by video and audio feeds.\nDistrict Judge William B. Sylvester has imposed a gag order on attorneys and investigators, and many court documents have been filed under seal, so little is known about Holmes\u2019 path from promising graduate student to suspect in a mass murder.\nThe few details that have been made public suggest a disturbing descent.\nHolmes enrolled in the University of Colorado, Denver Ph.D. program in neuroscience in 2011. In the spring of 2012, authorities say, he began buying weapons, high-capacity magazines, ammunition, explosives and combat gear. At some point in the school year, he began seeing a university psychiatrist. He failed an oral exam on June 7 and withdrew from the university three days later.\nHe was arrested outside the theater shortly after the July 20 shootings. Federal authorities have said he entered the theater with a ticket and is believed to have propped open a door, slipped out to his car and returned with his weapons.\nHours later, investigators found his apartment booby-trapped with potentially deadly explosives, police said.\nIn previous hearings \u2013 many witnessed by victims and survivors \u2014 Holmes\u2019 appearance and behavior ranged from bizarre to unremarkable. On his first day in court, his hair was a shocking orange-red, his face was covered with stubble and he seemed to be in a daze.\nBy last week, his hair was a natural-looking brown and he wore a full beard.

For a vast majority of folks, it's been a while seeing as how most cell phones now pull triple duty as our comms, our cameras, and our pocket computers. But getting photos and files off your phone has always been a sticking point\u2014you either have to run cables to your computer, email yourself the files, or entrust your sensitive data to some company's insecure cloud. With SanDisk's new Connect line, you'll never have to deal with cables or clouds again. And they won't anchor down your wallet, either.\nThe SanDisk Connect line allows you to wirelessly transfer data from your mobile device onto an external storage device, namely SanDisk's Connect USB or Connect Wireless Media Drive, using the device's integrated access point. So, for example, say I want to move the 2 GB of pictures that're clogging up my gallery off of my phone. Normally, I'd have to upload them to Dropbox if I was somewhere with a Wi-Fi signal or physically tether it to my laptop with a USB cable if I wasn't. But with the Connect, I simply hop onto the USB's secured access point with my phone and transfer the files wirelessly using the SanDisk Connect App. I can then either transfer the files to a laptop using its USB port or share them wirelessly among up to eight devices.\nThe Connect USB will be available in 16 and 32 GB varieties, $50 and $60 respectively, and are available for pre-order from Amazon today. A two-hour charge provides four hours of continuous runtime, and it's able to stream up to three separate video streams simultaneously to eight connected devices using its 802.11 BGN radio or on the web at Sandisk.com/WFD. Unfortunately, you can't actually use these access points to surf the web.\nWhat's more, the drive's 16/32GB MicroSD card will be swappable, allowing you to load multiple drives with media for sharing. The device's management app is available for iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire right now, though SanDisk is reportedly working on one for WP8 as well.\nThe Wireless Media Drive works essentially the same way as the USB but offers better performance and more storage. The Media Drive will be available in 16 and 32 GB for $80 and $100, respectively. Runtime and streaming capabilities are both improved with a three hour charge delivering five hours of continuous operation and up to five simultaneous 720p streams to eight connected devices. Plus, the Media Drive includes an SD slot allowing you to either pull data off the internal memory or a swappable SD card/adapter. Unfortunately, the device does not support SD cards higher than their native capacities so you can't expand its capacity with a spare 64GB+ SD card. The Media Drive's management app will be available at launch for iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire.\nAnd while the Media Drive can't compete with the Seagate Wireless Plus in terms of storage space (64GB vs 1TB) or include USB 3.0, it's a viable half-priced option\u2014with an additional five stream capacity\u2014for people that don't need to carry a terabyte of content with them at all times. Besides, 64 GB of space will store roughly 16 movies at 720p; how much more do you really need to share?"}

If lawmakers went home for the summer with report cards like their K-12 peers, how would their performance stack up? Here\u2019s a look at one of Congress\u2019s major responsibilities: spending bills.\nOpposition from members of the Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee led the House to get stuck at square one of the process: adopting a budget resolution. Without action in the lower chamber, the Senate had little reason to spend time on that task.\nThings did not improve for the House when spending bills came to the floor. In early June, Speaker Paul Ryan announced that amendment opportunities would be limited. This move, largely in response to a controversial provision involving protections for LGBT federal contractors, was unusual but not unprecedented: Democrats resorted to similar restrictions in 2009.\nCommittee work provided perhaps the brightest spot in Congress\u2019s work on spending bills this year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees managed to draft each of the 12 spending bills before the summer recess. This is an improvement on some recent years; in 2014, the Senate panel left four measures undone (in part out of concern about embarrassing amendments), and in 2010, the House Appropriations Committee approved only two. Even if these bills do not pass, complete committee drafts provide a solid framework for an omnibus package down the line.\nStill, despite the committees\u2019 work, few bills were passed by either chamber. The House completed action on five; the Senate passed three; none went to the president for his signature. This progress is paltry but not noticeably worse than efforts in recent presidential-election years. In 2012, the House completed action on seven measures before leaving for the summer, and the Senate finished none. In 2008, neither chamber passed a single spending bill before the August break.\nOne of Congress\u2019s highest-profile legislative standoffs this year has been over an emergency response to address the Zika outbreak. The Obama administration requested $1.9 billion in February to fight Zika. In May, the Senate rejected a proposal to fund the administration\u2019s full request before passing a $1.1 billion measure without offsets. The House passed a $622 million package that made corresponding cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, including from existing health programs. Democrats blocked a Republican-led compromise between the House and Senate versions that would have provided $1.1 billion toward Zika efforts while excluding funds from Planned Parenthood. No deal was reached, and members of both parties blamed inaction on the other side.\nThe House is scheduled to be in session for just four weeks in September before recessing for the election. A continuing resolution, or temporary spending measure, is likely, though its duration isn\u2019t yet clear.\nOne option, favored by appropriators, would involve a short-term package to carry programs through the election. Congress would then return in a lame-duck session to finish the job. A group of House conservatives, as well as some senators (including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn), have pushed for a longer CR that would run through March 2017. A similar approach was used during the past two presidential-election years. Doing this would put the task of funding the government on a potential collision course with the need to raise the debt ceiling next March.\nMembers of Congress are spending the next few weeks in their states and districts, with many"}

Now sculptor Mary-Ann Liu had one final task at Canada\u2019s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It was nearly 6 p.m. on Sunday, May 28, 2000, six hours after the solemn ceremony had begun. An enormous crane lifted the granite lid over top the open tomb.\nLiu, the winner of a national competition to design the tomb, and Maurice Joanisse, the Dominion Sculptor who created the granite sarcophagus to Liu\u2019s design, spread a thick layer of epoxy resin to permanently fix the cover in place.\nLiu expected the work party to be alone for this final, intimate act, but hundreds of spectators still pressed against the barriers surrounding Ottawa\u2019s National War Memorial as the crane swung the lid into place. The unnamed First World War soldier would not be alone when his tomb was sealed.\nWhat happened next caught Liu off guard.\n\u201cWhen the barriers came down people just flooded in,\u201d she said in a phone call from her Vancouver studio.\nWhat began spontaneously that spring evening has carried on ever since, a ritual of Canada Day and Remembrance Day when the Unknown Soldier \u2014 Le Soldat Inconnu \u2014 is covered in a mantle of crimson poppies or Canadian flags. People place letters and photographs on the tomb, and, at least once, a real officer\u2019s ceremonial sword.\nCpl. Nathan Cirillo, who was born more than 70 years after the First World War ended, literally gave his life while guarding the tomb, drawing his final breath as he lay at the Unknown Soldier\u2019s feet after a terrorist attack.\nThe tomb has become so central to Canadians\u2019 remembrance, it has in many ways surpassed the National War Memorial that soars over it as this country\u2019s ultimate symbol of war and sacrifice. Serge Durflinger, a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in Canada\u2019s military history and the memorialization of veterans, is among the thousands and thousands who have placed their poppies upon the tomb.\nThat reverence \u2014 the laying on of hands to the tomb \u2014 is part of a resurgence in Canadians\u2019 interest in the military and military history. In the years after the Vietnam War, Remembrance Day ceremonies were sparsely attended. The Canadian military was rocked by scandals, like the shameful beating death of a young Somalia teen at the hands of a Canadian soldier.

And he explained how that vision drives the company to focus on making useful, competent software that complements its chips. Nvidia, according to Wuebbling, isn\u2019t a hardware vendor \u2014 instead, the company is developing an ecosystem that comprises software and services as well. For Nvidia, building the entirety of a platform is crucial to creating the best experience for its customers even if that means annoying PC gamers who prefer competing cards.\nLast week, I wrote about how Nvidia\u2019s hardware is great to own because of its software. To follow up on this, I caught up with Wuebbling to ask about the motivation behind the company\u2019s efforts.\nThe hot new thing at Nvidia right now is the GTX 1080 and 1070 cards that run on the new Pascal architecture featuring a 16nm processor. These are powerful cards, and they have many loyal players pulling out their credit cards. But Wuebbling explains that Nvidia knows that the things that are getting those people excited to spend their money will fade, and the company wants to replace that anticipation with contentment. That is what fuels Nvidia to build all of the peripheral features that come along with the hardware.\nNvidia\u2019s notion that it is a \u201cplatform,\u201d however, is a point of some contention among PC gamers running Radeon cards from competitor AMD. In the past, AMD has claimed that Nvidia\u2019s GameWorks \u2014 which is a suite of tools that enable developers to include certain visual tricks in games on GeForce cards \u2014 can sabotage performance on Radeons. Nvidia reaches out to studios and will often help publishers market games for developers that use GameWorks \u2014 that\u2019s why you see the Nvidia splash screen on so many PC games.\nNvidia has denied that GameWorks is meant to hurt the competition, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Radeon owners from blaming Nvidia for the occasional game that doesn\u2019t run as well on AMD chips. When I asked Wuebbling if he was trying to win over those fans, he said that he\u2019s more interested in ensuring that people who choose Nvidia for the first time as well as the returning customers are happy.\nOver the last several years, Nvidia has not announced a new chip without also talking about the features it\u2019s bringing to GeForce Experience. And that\u2019s because the company isn\u2019t a collection of engineers banging away at silicon in a workshop \u2014 more than half of its engineers work primarily on software.\nA lot of those resources go toward ensuring the latest drivers are up to date as new big-name games launch. Updating those drivers, however, has grown more complicated as Nvidia has introduced new products like the Shield tablet and Android streaming box.\nAn update to a GeForce graphics card cannot cause a problem with features like streaming games to those other devices or using Shadowplay to livestream to Twitch. An example is streaming HDR (high-dynamic range) visuals, which enables a wider spectrum of colors and gamma settings, from a GeForce 1080 to the Shield. To implement that, the software and hardware teams across a number of Nvidia products have to work in concert with one another.\nBeyond the"}

The Advancement Project's co-director Penda Hair explains why this lawsuit is necessary.\nThe Advancement Project has joined forces with the Fair Elections Legal Network, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, and Project Vote to file a lawsuit against the state of Florida to stop an initiative that attempts to remove \u201cnon-citizens\u201d from voter registration rolls via a mass-purging process formed from questionable methods. The lawsuit would cover the entire state and would suspend the voter purging for at least a year.\nTo date, dozens of Floridians and U.S. citizens have come forward stating that they were wrongly identified as \u201cnon-citizens\u201d and are at risk of losing their right to vote. The Department of Justice is also suing Florida over the program. We caught up with The Advancement Project\u2019s co-director Penda Hair to explain the lawsuit, the problems with Florida\u2019s voter purging initiative and the history of voter discrimination in the state.\nNow that this lawsuit against Florida has been filed, what\u2019s next in the process to block Florida\u2019s voter purging initiative?\nThe lawsuit is filed in Miami with the federal Southern District Court of Florida. We are asking for a preliminary injunction to block the program. This would be an emergency ruling that will move more quickly than a normal civil suit, and we expect the court to take this up very quickly. We believe this is a case where the voters themselves can have their voices heard. We will bring Florida voters to court so they can make their case about how this program is affecting them. It\u2019s a broad-based effort in terms of public education and activism and obviously the legal complaint. The Advancement Project has been doing voting rights work in Florida since the 2000 elections \u2013 I think this is our fifth or sixth lawsuit here \u2013 and we are very familiar with these kinds of shenanigans.\nOne thing is that it is discriminatory on the basis of race and language status. The Advancement Project\u2019s research has confirmed that 87% of the people on Florida\u2019s purge list are people of color and more than 50% are Latinos. So while states are allowed to make their lists more accurate they can\u2019t target people of color for purging in the process. Congress found that there has been a history of certain states using lists like Florida\u2019s to target minorities for purging, so they have determined that certain types of massive systematic purges can not happen 90 days before a federal election, and Florida\u2019s purge program illustrates why Congress was correct in making that determination.\nIt\u2019s unclear from Florida state government officials when this problem actually started, though. It was announced to the public in May, but Gov. Rick Scott says it actually began last year. How will a clear starting date be determined?\nWe are suing under the Voting Rights Act Section 2 which prohibits policies that have discriminatory results. This was defined very clearly by Congress, which says you do not have to prove a bad purpose or discriminatory intent to show violation of VRA. The courts will look at the history of voter discrimination, the impacts of the new policy and the justification of the policy and then will determine under the totality of those facts if there is a discriminatory result. We\u2019re confident that the courts will find that all of those factors line up \u2013 it has an overwhelming discriminatory impact, there\u2019s a history of voter discrimination in the state and very little justification for doing this right now.\nLet\u2019s be real.

Committee members say they will continue to push for the release of hundreds of thousands of documents pertaining to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s career that have not been released to the senators or the public.\nBut more document disclosures seem unlikely with Republican leadership pushing forward on President Donald Trump's nominee and progressive activists are growing ever more impatient with Senate Democrats, demanding that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer keep his members unified in opposition and calling on him to do more to defeat Kavanaugh.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is on the line and you\u2019re failing us,\u201d a group of 13 progressive organizations wrote in a letter to Schumer.\nProgressives are demanding that Schumer enforce party discipline and not allow Democratic senators who face re-election in states where Trump won in 2016, and remains popular, to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\"Your strategy to sacrifice the Supreme Court in order to hold Democratic Senate seats is not only strategically and morally wrong, it will fail,\u201d the letter continues.\nEven if all 49 Senate Democrats vote against the nomination, Kavanaugh will be confirmed unless two of the 51 Republicans join them in dissent.\nBut Democrats could lose ground in their quest to take back control of the Senate if they all stick together. And Schumer is unlikely to attempt any drastic measure to try to enforce complete unity.\nThree Democrats who face re-election in just weeks in Republican-heavy states voted in favor of Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. All three \u2014 Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana \u2014 are in highly competitive races.\nAt the hearing, Democrats presented no damning evidence or testimony that threatened to strip him of any GOP support.\nDemocrats delayed the hearings\u2019 proceedings by a few hours, protesting the volumes of documents that had been withheld from senators\u2019 and the public\u2019s view pertaining to Kavanaugh\u2019s career as counsel and as staff secretary in President George W.

In the video, Mora says his mother received a text from a mutual friend who reported seeing the tiger near Benny\u2019s Garage close by. Mora says he stopped by a Border Patrol station yesterday and asked if the tiger story was a hoax, and that an agent told him the story is real. This conflicts with a Sheriff media spokesperson this morning who stated that no sightings of the tiger have been reported other than by undocumented immigrants apprehended.\nJuly 1, 2018 (Boulevard) \u2013 Reports of a possible tiger in East County have been made by undocumented immigrants picked up by the Border Patrol, dispatchers at the Sheriff\u2019s office and Border Patrol have confirmed to East County Magazine. Reports of large paw prints have been reported by multiple residents in the Boulevard area and recreational enthusiasts in nearby McCain Valley report hearing what they believed sounded like a tiger growl.\nBut the only reported photo thus far appears to be a hoax, while eye witness accounts remain unconfirmed.\nA group of undocumented immigrants taken into custody by Border Patrol first reported seeing the tiger but it was unclear whether they actually saw one and if so, which side of the border it was on, Karla Menzies at the Sheriff\u2019s department today informed ECM. She said there have been no other sightings and also debunked a rumor that a deputy saw the animal. \"There have been no sightings by any deputy,\" she stated.\nA photo purporting to show a tiger crossing the border at Tecate, shown on radar, appears to be a hoax, since the same photo appeared in a publication in India, the Deccan Chronicle, back in February.\nBorder Patrol confirmed however that very large tracks seen near a deer carcass in Boulevard are being investigated by the California Fish & Wildlife Department. Several posters in online forums also claim to have tracks on their property that they believe appear larger than a typical mountain lion.\nECM has called Calif. Fish and Wildlife but have not yet heard back.\nOther sources have indicated traps have been put out in Jewel Valley as a precaution but thus far there has been no confirmation of any tiger in the area.\nDrug cartels have been known to use tigers and other exotic cats to guard drug stashes and to smuggle drugs into the U.S. in hidden compartments under tiger cages in the past. Also in recent months, tiger cubs have been seized at border crossings from people who obtained them in Tijuana, Mexico. Another tiger fell from a balcony in Tijuana and was injured. The owner of a private ranch in Tecate that kept exotic animals in 2013 told the Reader about a tiger that escaped, but was shot.\nSo it\u2019s not inconceivable that an adult tiger could have escaped captivity and crossed the border (the border fence ends in rugged terrain in Jacumba, just east of Boulevard), but there\u2019s thus far no evidence to confirm sighting reports, and the only purported photo lacks credibility.\nIf you have credible information. eyewitness accounts or photos, or evidence please let us know at (619) 698-7617 or editor@eastcountymagazine.org.\nProtect my"}

Not only do politicians want to keep the pledges they have made on specific policies. They try to be generally in sync with who they were on the campaign trail too, as political scientist Richard Fenno found in his research on Congress. So a candidate who runs as a partisan will try to govern as a partisan. A candidate who runs as a conservative will govern as a conservative. A candidate who runs as a member of an ethnic group will, if elected, emphasize group identity.\nEven if new issues arise out of the blue (and they always will), the president will in effect ask herself: What would the version of me from the campaign do about this? How will I be able to explain what I do now in terms of who I was back then?\nMoreover, the promises that count the most are likely the ones made in the candidates\u2019 high-profile appearances. For presidential nominees, the biggest such events are convention acceptance speeches and the general-election debates in the fall. But before that, nomination debates are as high profile as it gets.\nThinking of democracy in terms of representation is different from the focus on accountability. Representation involves the politician: what she vows to do, how she governs with those promises in mind, how she explains her actions to constituents in light of those original pledges. It\u2019s part of a continuing relationship with voters, a bond that can develop over time as the politician earns her constituents\u2019 trust.\nAccountability, on the other hand, refers to voters\u2019 decisions on how well a politician has done in office and what they do to hold him or her responsible for results. It\u2019s what people think democracy is, but it doesn\u2019t capture how democracy really works.\nIndividual elected officials can only rarely deliver specific results that voters identify as the politician\u2019s responsibility. Even presidents can\u2019t just decide, in a system of separated institutions sharing power, to carry out some policy voters will like, let alone decide to have an economic boom or a foreign-policy success.\nAnd voters don\u2019t pay enough attention to politics to know which officials are responsible for what policy. They are prone to do irrational things such as punishing incumbents for bad weather, shark attacks and losses by local sports teams.\nSo expecting voters to reward or punish politicians for what they\u2019ve done will rarely work. Yes, there are baseline incentives: Presidents don\u2019t want to lose wars or start recessions. But that\u2019s about all.\nRepresentation, by contrast, gives politicians the realistic goal of building a strong relationship with their constituents. It provides the democracy that accountability can\u2019t \u2014 as long as politicians try to be good representatives. And we have plenty of evidence that they do."}

It\u2019s as easy to use as any Bluetooth speaker could be, and it sounds pretty good too.\nThe Braven 650 is a premium portable Bluetooth speaker, joining a category kick-started by the Jawbone JAMBOX. It\u2019s a versatile little device, although you pay for its convenience. As small speakers go, it sounds good.\nThe Braven 650 speaker, measuring 158 x 69 x 45mm, is not a tiny device by any standards, but it\u2019s small enough to slip unobtrusively into a backpack or travel bag. It weighs just under 400 grams \u2014 not too light, but definitely not heavy. It looks surprisingly similar to the now-aged Mac Pro, with an anodised, silver aluminium shell cut with a pattern of small holes on the front and back. 688 holes, in fact. We counted.\nThere\u2019s a BRAVEN logo up top, and two small rubber feet on the bottom, but it\u2019s the left and right sides of the 650 that are the most important. On the left side, you\u2019ve got two ports, one switch, and three buttons \u2014 microUSB charging, 3.5mm stereo audio input, power on/off, volume up and down, and a multifunction Bluetooth/phone call toggle.\nOn the right, it\u2019s all about outputs \u2014 there\u2019s a check battery button with a light (white for more than half full, blue for less than half, and red for critically low), a 3.5m stereo audio output, and a USB port.\nThe USB port is probably the most useful (and innovative feature) of the Braven 650 apart from the speakers themseves \u2014 as long as you\u2019ve got the USB charging cable for your phone, you can hook it up to the 650 and charge it at least partially. It\u2019ll also drain the speaker\u2019s battery completely, giving you as much juice as it possibly can. With the 2000mAh battery pack inside the Braven 650, you\u2019ll get around 60 per cent charge on a modern big-screen Android smartphone like the Samsung Galaxy S4, and a full charge on an iPhone 5 with enough power left over to play a couple of hours of music as well.\nThe Bluetooth connection of the Braven 650 is simple enough to set up \u2014 as long as the speaker\u2019s switched on, it\u2019ll be constantly visible and can remember the pairing of up to 8 devices at once (add more and the first-added will be dropped off). No passcode is needed on most modern smartphones and tablets \u2014 click the Connect button in your device\u2019s Bluetooth menu and the rest happens automatically. You can even connect two devices to the 650 at the same time, although if you play music from one while using another, the speaker will switch to the newest audio source.\nBraven\u2019s 650 has a stereo speaker setup, distinguishing it from the JAMBOX and the plethora of other portable speakers that only have a single-speaker array. There are two tweeters on the 650\u2019s \u2018front\u2019, measuring around 2/3-inch, and two slightly larger mid-range drivers on the \u2018back\u2019 at around 1-inch.

Surely after such a long experiment and such a slow progress, it is time to look for new methods to deal with this problem.\nMicrocredit has had limited successes where it has been implemented sensibly and prudently but it is now widely accepted that it is not a panacea and will not eradicate poverty alone. It relies on the assumption that everyone wants to be an entrepreneur and indeed has the skills to be an entrepreneur along with a feasible business idea. In the US about 11 percent of the adult population are entrepreneurs with a slightly smaller percentage in the UK and less again in Europe, so why would we assume that it would be a significantly higher percentage in Bangladesh?\nSimilarly, the interest payments on microcredit are so much higher than base rates in most cases that it is prohibitive to the start-up of business. In addition, microcredit has been used extensively for loans with no business base at all. There are many examples of very poor people borrowing very small amounts of money to buy a blanket in the winter for example, with no hope of ever repaying and ultimately sustaining by simply repackaging their loan into a new loan when they cannot make repayments.\nAn alternative social solution now very much in vogue is asset-giving where the ultra poor are given an asset, such as a cow or goats. They are given a weekly stipend to enable them to feed the animals and some training in animal husbandry. The jury is still out on the success of this method but at its root it is still an entry into entrepreneurship and leaves the recipient with all the vulnerability of very small-scale agriculture. Animals get sick and die, weather is unpredictable and market conditions change, all problems more easily managed with economies of scale. If you have fifty cows and one dies then you sustain but if you have one cow and it dies then you are out of business with no start-up capital to begin again.\nIt must therefore be time to turn problem of poverty on its head, look at it from another angle entirely.\nWhat is needed to eradicate poverty in rural Bangladesh? Sustainable employment. The vast majority of people want a job. Jobs are what people want and jobs will eradicate poverty.\nBangladesh is not a 'charity case' full of people waiting for a hand out, rather it is a huge source of manpower waiting for the opportunity to work; a people with dignity. So now the problem we need to solve is not one of poverty eradication, but of employment creation.\nEmployment creation is a very different challenge from the problem of poverty eradication. We have turned a problem into a challenge and the challenge of employment creation quite clearly belongs in the sphere of business.\nReadymade garments (RMG) have been the most successful industry in the history of Bangladesh employing around 5 million people and responsible for more than 70 percent of GDP, but the benefit that RMG brings to the people is small by comparison. The biggest problem is one of location. Factories are located in areas convenient to factory owners or in specified export zones, and are staffed largely by economic migrants from the villages. A workforce located in their own villages, workers living in their own homes, would likely bring much greater benefit in poverty reduction to a larger number of people.\nThere are however, specific issues associated with getting rural Bangladesh to work.

The Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (AIADMK) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) have a combined strength of 15 members. Seven members belong to small political parties, eight are nominated and six are independent members of the Upper House.\nThe Congress appears to have the support of 101 members at present and will require the backing of another 21 members. The arithmetic is likely to change during voting, depending on the number of people present in the House. If the BSP and the SP stage a walkout, like they did in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, it will ease some pressure on the UPA. The numbers required for a simple majority in such a case may come down to 108.\nJai Mrug, a Mumbai-based political analyst and psephologist, said that in spite of protests petering out, the government is keen on passing the Bill. \u201cIt wants to be looked upon as someone who has redeemed its pledge.

Why not encourage the county to invest in the natural progression and efficient option of moving to Verona and turn that fine Staunton energy to creating another hub of community involvement and economic activity? There are several buildings that call for attention and reuse around the courthouse.\nThis November, if the decision is made by my fellow county residents to build ourselves a new heart to our government in the county, this firm decision may open the way for new investment in this prime area of downtown Staunton."}

I'm here mainly because of my work on a Tax Guide for Investors that appears at the web site referenced below. (In real life I'm a tax lawyer in Chicago.) I started it as a general guide for investors and spent a fair amount of time hanging around the Tax Strategies Board. But I quickly saw that the hottest topic was Roth IRAs and jumped into that with both feet. I ended up posting nearly 100 pages of guidance on this subject on my web site. In addition, being a professional nitpicker (and wanting my web site to be accurate in every detail) I have been in contact with people in Washington who are writing the technical corrections act and preparing IRS guidance on Roth IRAs.\nWithin available time constraints I'm happy to help where I can, although it doesn't appear there is much of a need. Pixy is doing a terrific job, and there is a tremendous wealth of other talent here as well. I'm really here more to learn what I can, both from those who ask questions and those who provide answers.\nMaybe you can start by telling us what you've learned regarding converting a SEP-IRA directly to a Roth. Some pros say it's possible as nothing prohibits it, my legal department has said no because the SEP is treated like a qualified plan. Me? I've been waiting impatiently for IRS guidance. Have your sources touched on this issue?\nFor purposes of this section, the term \"qualified rollover contribution\" means a rollover contribution to a Roth IRA from another such account, or from an individual retirement plan, but only if such rollover contribution meets the requirements of section 408(d)(3).\nSo the question is whether a SEP IRA is an \"individual retirement plan.\" If it is, you can roll it.\n(B) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b).\nAfter the dashes are a lot of requirements that must be met to qualify as a SEP. But the starting point is that it has to be an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. And if it is, then it must be an individual retirement plan as defined in section 7701(a)(37). And if it is, you're permitted to roll it to a Roth IRA by reason of section 408A(e). I guess it would be an exaggeration to call this straightforward, but I don't see any ambiguity here; it seems perfectly clear that you *can* roll a SEP IRA directly to a Roth IRA if you meet the other requirements (modified AGI <= $100,000 and not married filing separately).\nI have not spoken to anyone at the IRS about this. But I have posed the question to two pretty knowledgeable persons. One is a Senate staffer working on technical corrections for Roth IRAs, the other works at Treasury and is involved in drafting the \"questions and answers\" guidance that will come out on this subject. (In the unlikely event there are any non-professionals who read this far I should point out that Treasury and IRS are not synonymous; IRS is an arm of the Treasury.) Both of those individuals agreed without hesitation that a direct roll from a SEP IRA to a Roth IRA is permissible. My hope is that the Q&A guidance will include this item but I can't give assurance on that.\nThe more interesting question is why, apart from the rush they were in when the drafted the original legislation, will they not permit a direct roll"}

Nath, however, said the practice of singing \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 on the first working day of every month was being discontinued for the time being and that his government has decided to implement it in \u201cnaya swaroop\u201d (new form).\n\u201cWe have not taken this decision under any agenda nor are we opposed to singing \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019. It is deeply rooted in our hearts and we have sung it from time-to-time. We will start it again but in a different form,\u201d Nath said in a statement. He also criticised those who were trying to politicise the issue. \u201cI condemn those who do politics in the name of either temple or Vande Mataram. We are bringing it (Vande Mataram) in a new form and I will make an announcement on it within a day or two,\u201d the chief minister said."}

{"idx": "31715", "prompt": "Continue the following text: How about some juicy Star Wars rumors for your weekend? These come from The Hollywood Reporter, who say much has changed with Star Wars Episode VII since original screenwriter Michael Arndt left the project last year. Reportedly Arndt wanted the film to focus on the offspring of the original trilogy characters (Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo) while director J.J. Abrams wanted Episode VII to focus on those characters, keeping the offspring in the background until Episode VIII and Episode IX.\nMeanwhile, while this shake up was going on, Abrams continued to take meetings with all kinds of actors. Pretty much anyone that\u2019s previously been reported (Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael B. Jordan, etc.) took a meeting as well as new names Michael Fassbender, Adam Driver and Hugo Weaving.\nThe Hollywood Reporter posted this vast update on the project. Among their points is that, yes, Jesse Plemons is being looked at for a role.\nBasically, Michael Arndt wanted the sequel trilogy to be focused on the younger offspring of Han, Leia and Luke, who each had supporting roles. Now, it seems, Abrams has flipped those ratios. If the rumors are true, Han, Luke and Leia will be the focus of this first new adventure, giving audiences one more chance to see them in all their glory. That would make Episode VII their send off before Episode VIII and IX would focus on the supporting characters introduced in VII. Among those on Arndt\u2019s side was George Lucas, but it was no longer his call, instead differing to Abrams and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.\nAccording to THR, this radical change is why many of the actors we\u2019ve heard in the past are no long in contention. Roles previously thought to be major are no longer major. One example is a 20-something year old in the script has been aged into their 40s. \u201cSome characters have disappeared from the Arndt script and new ones are being drafted,\u201d THR said.\nAs for Fassbender, Driver and Weaving, their meetings have reportedly been aimed at this new version of the film and while there\u2019s no word on who Fassbender or Driver could potentially play, Weaving would supposedly be an Imperial commander.\nFinally, THR reports Abrams is now looking for \u201ca 20-something female actress who is either of mixed race or black. The rumor is that Obi-Wan Kenobi had a daughter or granddaughter.\u201d That\u2019s a rumor we\u2019ve been hearing at /Film headquarters for a long time.\nWhere does this leave us? Pretty much nowhere. Abrams is still having meetings, Plemons is in the mix and hopefully things will be firmed up in the coming weeks before a big, public announcement. As a huge Star Wars fan though, I can\u2019t be the only one thinking the less Abrams asks of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in 2014, the better. I want them in the film, but they\u2019ve had their time in the sun. It\u2019s time to pass the lightsaber."}

In fact, it's going to go a lot faster,\" Sidgmore said in a keynote address at the Networld+Interop trade show today. \"This environment is all about speed; it's all about change.\"\nBut afterwards, Sidgmore said the fundamental technologies on which the Internet is built need to change. \"The technology [for Net growth] doesn't exist yet,\" he added, voicing optimism that the attraction of both financial and intellectual capital to the Net will bring the necessary building blocks online.\nSidgmore also warned that expectations of fast, cheap Internet usage may not be realized.\n\"Fast Internet access can't be cheap,\" he said. \"That's a huge expectation problem because the world believes Internet access should be cheap with a $20 or $21 a month model. But the math doesn't work.\"\nUsers who access content nearby aren't the costly users, he said--it's those who fetch information from distant servers.\n\"We have to make content local for the Internet to scale,\" he noted.\nSidgmore's optimism about continued Internet growth stems in part from his belief that the increases in Internet usage to date have been fueled by new users.\n\"All the new multimedia applications--that's all in the future. When these new applications start to come on, we will see a new level of demand growth that we've never seen before\" because multimedia applications demand far more bandwidth than text or graphics, he predicted.\nTraditional telecommunications firms are jumping on the Internet bandwagon because they fear for their futures if they don't, Sidgmore contended. Half of international phone calls today are in fax transmissions, he noted, which could as easily go over the Net as on traditional voice networks.\n\"What is at stake for telcos is not the niche market but the core business,\" he said. \"That realization made them move. That's why they started buying ISPs. They didn't start becoming cool overnight. They got scared.\""}

The study reveals that aging timelines are lengthening, as the average age one would classify someone as \"old\" is now 74, up from 68 in 20091. Furthermore, expectations for longevity are reaching new heights - Americans expect to live to age 84, on average.\n\"People are living longer2 and surely that influences perception of what is deemed to be 'old age'. But it's also influenced by how Americans aspire to live their lives as they age,\" says Matt Sadowsky, director of retirement and annuities, TD Ameritrade. \"Our survey shows that people see aging as a time to pursue new goals and passions, reflecting that they intend to live active, fulfilling lives deeper into retirement. A more active lifestyle at older ages contributes to the shift in our perception of old age.\"\n\"Our findings show that whether you're a millennial or a boomer, people are generally upbeat about the opportunities that come with aging,\" continues Sadowsky. \"Americans are more likely to associate aging with wisdom (65 percent) and experience (69 percent), than becoming a burden (18 percent) or becoming out of touch (17 percent). The optimism extends across all the generations.\"\n\"Financial considerations for retirement are very real concerns and do weigh heavy. Nevertheless, our survey shows most people view retirement as the most liberating phase of their lives,\" Sadowsky concludes.\nTD Ameritrade provides investing services and education to more than 11 million client accounts totaling more than $1.2 trillion in assets, and custodial services to more than 6,000 registered investment advisors.

Norman \u201cHairy Norm\u201d Davidson came storming into the Rochester and Strood by-election count in a purple top hat speckled with novelty badges, surrounded by an entourage, which included Mad Mike Young (wielding a giant pencil to draw \u201cthe political bigger picture\u201d), and a dazed-looking man in a fez.\nA running joke at otherwise wearisome by-election battles since the Eighties, the Loonies have long been fielding candidates like Hairy Norm to lampoon the sweaty and suited automatons from warring Westminster parties who battle for first place.\nBut since the suicide of their iconic founder and leader, Screaming Lord Sutch, in 1999, what is their place in modern politics other than providing grateful journalists with a dash of colour \u2013 and, in last month\u2019s case, some bananas for energy? \u201c\u2018Ave a banaaaana\u201d is hardly the anarchic satire for which they received so much love and attention in previous decades.\nTheir tagline \u2013 \u201cVote for insanity: you know it makes sense\u201d \u2013 used to be a harbinger of doom for some candidates from rival parties during the party\u2019s heyday. Sutch, who contested 41 parliamentary seats in his lifetime, essentially destroyed the SDP when, in a 1990 by-election, he beat the party\u2019s candidate by 263 votes in the Merseyside constituency of Bootle.\nAs eccentrics from fringe parties seem to be gaining ground in British politics today, could this spell a renaissance for the Loonies? The Lib Dem candidate only won 198 more votes than Hairy Norm in Rochester, and the party still has a handful of councillors nationwide.\nComparisons to Ukip are tempting.

It was an impressive rebound from October's flat reading and partly reflected a strong recovery in the country's manufacturing sector, after the return of two major auto plants from October shutdowns.\nEconomists had largely expected the November bounce-back, in light of previously released monthly data that showed a recovery in manufacturing and exports. But they noted that the growth spurt went well beyond the country's factories, as 17 of 20 industry sectors recorded gains.\nAfter a relatively tepid third quarter and October's weak start to the fourth quarter, the November figures are an encouraging sign that Canada's broad-based economic recovery is on track.\n\"The Canadian economy fired on all cylinders in November: Production resumptions led the way, but nearly all major sectors reported gains on the month,\" Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist Brian DePratto said in a research note. \"As shown by this month's breadth of growth, the underlying trend for the Canadian economy remains a positive one.\"\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to leave its key interest rate unchanged in its first rate-setting meeting of the new year. But the brief statement accompanying the decision suggested the Fed is prepared to raise rates again at its next meeting, in March, in light of further strength in key U.S. economic indicators \u2013 and, most significantly, what it now sees as rising inflationary pressures.\nThe statement upgraded the Fed's assessment of growth in household spending and business investment, now identifying them along with the U.S. job market as \"solid\" sources of economic growth. It said market-based indicators of inflation expectations are rising. Crucially, it said it now anticipates rising inflation \"this year\" \u2013 replacing its previous bleak assertion that it expected inflation to remain below its 2-per-cent objective \"in the near term\" \u2013 considered a significant upgrade in the inflation outlook.\nThe statement removed whatever doubt remained in financial markets that another quarter-percentage-point Fed rate increase is coming at the March meeting, adding to the Fed's three quarter-point rate hikes last year. The Fed's key rate, the federal funds rate, is now set at a range of 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent, after the most recent hike in December.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the bond market put the odds of a March Fed rate hike at 99 per cent, up from 90 per cent the day before the Fed statement.\nIn Canada, meanwhile, the encouraging GDP rebound added modestly to the chances that the Bank of Canada will follow the Fed's lead and hike its own key rate again in the spring, although the hike is still considered less certain in Canada's case.

Today, end credits roll at light speed while a teaser for the series\u2019 next episode or the network\u2019s show that is coming up plays. Now MTV is taking aim at production companies\u2019 logo cards that normally run after the end credits, visually separating one show from the next. The cable network is moving all logo cards from end of show to the third break where they will appear before the episode\u2019s fourth act.\nThe new policy has already been implemented on Teen Mom 2 and last week\u2019s Real World special and is being enforced for all upcoming series, including the fifth season of Jersey Shore and new docu-series Caged. The first scripted series to comply with the new rules is new comedy I Just Want My Pants Back, which premieres on Feb. 2. Because the spots for the producers\u2019 logo cards are specified in their contracts, MTV technically has to have their blessing for the move. There had been speculation that not all producers are happy about the new initiative, with rumors that Pants executive producers Doug Liman and Dave Bartis have opted to pull the card for their Hypnotic banner over the proposed relocation. Sources close to the series confirm that all logo cards for Pants: of MTV, Universal Cable Prods. and Hypnotic, will indeed be dropped but stress that that was the result of a mutual agreement between MTV and the producers to eliminate viewer distraction, especially for the first 2 episodes of the series, which are airing back-to-back.\nBut while taking the logo cards out of end credits would indeed provide a more seamless transition between two shows, it may create confusion in the new place they\u2019re put in. The logic is that viewers instinctively flip the channel or get up to go to the bathroom or the kitchen when they see the production companies logo cards, a subconscious sign that their show is over. Wouldn\u2019t seeing those cards earlier trigger a similar reaction, resulting in some viewers quitting the show before the final act or leave viewers wondering whether the program they\u2019re watching is over or not? If MTV\u2019s new policy sticks, look for other networks to adopt it for competitive reasons. And, because of the awkwardness of placing the logo cards 3/4 into the show, more producers may opt to drop them, which begs the question, has MTV found a stealth way of eliminating TV production companies logo cards altogether?"}

The deal includes an incentives package for Amazon that totals $102 million in city and state funding.\nFor months, Nashville had been among 20 cities competing in Amazon\u2019s very public sweepstakes for its second headquarters location.\nOn three occasions since March, Amazon executives visited Nashville, hearing the city's pitch at trendy restaurants including The 404 Kitchen and touring neighborhoods such as East Nashville, the Gulch, Germantown and the Vanderbilt area.\nNashville, which has seen its national profile soar in recent years, was often mentioned as a dark horse by observers but never a favorite to score Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.

People close to the discussions have suggested that the company\u2019s founders \u2013 Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, who also founded controversial music-swapping site Kazaa \u2013 have themselves had difficulty agreeing on what the company is worth.\nSkype has more than 50m customers, but only 2m of these pay for services. Skype calls from one computer to another are entirely free, but the company charges for calls to mobile phones and landlines.\nAnalysts estimate that the company receives about \u20ac20-\u20ac30 a year from each paying customer. It also receives a share of revenues from the sale of headsets and telephone handsets that customers need to make calls on their computer. It may also get some revenues from partnership deals with internet portals such as Tom.com in China. Together, these are estimated to give the company annual revenues of \u20ac50m-\u20ac70m ($62m-$87m).\nAnalysts say the value of Skype is not in the annual sales, but in its large customer community and its technology, which could be harnessed by a company like eBay.\nEbay could, for example, add telephone bidding services to its auction site, or use some of Skype\u2019s file transfer technology to start selling online content, such as music or videos, through its site in addition to physical goods. Nevertheless, many are sceptical of whether Skype would add $3bn worth of value to eBay.\nA number of internet and technology companies have recently moved into providing voice calls over internet lines. Last month Google, the internet search company, introduced software that allows people to send instant messages and make voice calls on their computers.

It began in July 2016 after complaints were received by trading standards and the police from residents about false statements being made by the men when they cold called, offering Tarmacking services.\nThe men claimed they were working for the Highways Agency or local councils in relation to legitimate road repairs taking place in the residents\u2019 areas. They also claimed they had material left over from the legitimate work and offered to Tarmac driveways and parking areas at a low price.\nThinking they were getting a good deal and were dealing with legitimate traders, the residents agreed to the work.\nHowever, work was carried out to areas which were not agreed to and when jobs were completed, the men demanded significantly higher prices. In most cases the prices were inflated by tenfold.\nIn the first report to the police and trading standards, a resident from the Whitby area agreed to work to his farm track.\nBased on the price he was quoted, he calculated the final bill would be about \u00a32,300 but he was presented with an invoice for more than \u00a323,000. When he queried the price and refused to pay, he was bombarded with phone calls from Henry Thomas and Thomas Mounsey, leaving him fearful and intimidated.\nIn another case, a woman who was alone at home in the East Riding agreed to work to her driveway. She calculated the bill should be in the region of \u00a3500.\nOn completion of the work she was asked for \u00a32,500. One of the men, Shaun Thomas Snr, followed her into her home. He eventually dropped the price to \u00a32,200 which she paid. She said she felt too frightened to argue and wanted the situation to end.\nIn a further case, a disabled woman living near Pickering agreed to work to her parking area after calculating from the quoted price that the final bill would be about \u00a3200.\nWhen the work was completed she was told the price was \u00a32,500 plus VAT.

That\u2019s low rates in action. They dull our sense of the consequences of irresponsible money management by allowing individuals and governments to spend beyond their means at low cost.\nBy not pushing governments to get control of their finances, we increase the chances that drastic actions will be needed in the future to cut spending. The longer we wait, the harder the hit will be to your personal finances. Taxes or user fees could go up, services could be reduced, jobs could be lost and opportunities for career and salary gains across the economy could be limited. If you think current economic conditions aren\u2019t floating your boat, just wait.\nThe Liberals set the tone for this election in a March budget that broke a promise to have a balanced budget this year. Instead, the government announced programs for seniors, women and students that put the province into deficit.\nThe NDP offered an election platform that relied on targeted tax increases and deficit spending to fund programs like pharmacare, dental care, $12-a-day child care and grants instead of loans for post-secondary students. The Conservatives never bothered to provide a full accounting of their plans, which included a drop in hydro rates and gasoline taxes, a cut in corporate tax rates and a reduction in the middle-income tax rate. There\u2019s also a plan to eliminate provincial income tax on people with a low income \u2013 this would replace a scheduled increase in the provincial minimum wage next year to $15 per hour from $14.\nSome of the policies in the election campaign addressed real issues. A cut in corporate taxes could make Ontario more competitive at a time when U.S. rates for business have been falling, while anger at hydro costs in the province is something that unites people of all parties. In an economy that increasingly slots young workers into temporary jobs with no benefits, it makes sense for government to support public health by covering the cost of drugs and dental visits.\nBut in announcing policies like these, each party made the same mistake as many households in acting like cost is no object in living your life. In a low-rate world, it seems like you never have to say no.\nThere are plenty of zero-debt Canadians and some provincial governments that are living within their means. But there\u2019s a bigger picture. While people seem stressed about their finances when asked in surveys and polls, their behaviour as spenders and voters shows they are not willing to cut back.\nMeantime, it\u2019s becoming increasingly urgent for people and governments to bring their spending in line with money coming in. Interest rates on both government and individual borrowing have increased in the past 12 months and will likely go higher. As debt-carrying costs move higher, additional strain is placed on household and government budgets.\nRates are rising because the economy\u2019s doing well enough to generate concern about rising inflation. We\u2019re getting closer to the peak of the current economic cycle, a point where people and governments are best positioned to take control of their finances. It will only get tougher when the economy inevitably starts to slow down.\nGovernments under financial stress tend to chop, not trim, spending. When the federal Liberals decided to attack a ballooning deficit in the mid-1990s, they made the largest federal spending cuts in this country\u2019s history, including health care and education transfers to the provinces.\nOur aversion to that kind of cutting was evident in the Ontario election campaign.

{"idx": "31755", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Nurse anesthetists most commonly work in hospital operating rooms.\nNurse anesthetists work in nearly every clinical setting imaginable, from busy inner-city hospitals to small rural clinics. These registered nurses provide care at every stage of an operation, from evaluating patients prior to giving them anesthesia to administering oxygen if surgical complications arise. To work in this field, nurses must have a bachelor's degree, complete a nurse anesthetist program and obtain credentialing as a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, or CRNA.\nMany nurse anesthetists work in hospital operating rooms, assisting in both routine and complex surgical procedures. They ensure there's an adequate blood supply in case of an emergency, monitor the patient's vital signs, administer oxygen, insert artificial airways and prevent the patient from going into shock. They may also obtain supplies and prepare surgical equipment, in addition to explaining to patients how anesthesia works. At a large, metropolitan hospital, they usually work under the supervision of a surgeon or anesthesiologist. At smaller, rural hospitals they're often solely responsible for administering anesthesia.\nNurse anesthetists sometimes work at private dental offices, assisting during procedures such as root canals or dental surgery. In contrast to those working at large hospitals, nurse anesthetists at dental offices often have more limited responsibilities. Because dental procedures are more routine than operations performed at hospitals, nurses aren't responsible for more complex tasks such as securing blood or analyzing pre-surgical bloodwork. They work under the supervision of the dentist, administering anesthesia, ensuring it's enough to keep the patient sedated, and then monitoring patients as they awaken.\nSome nurse anesthetists work at stand-alone maternity centers, where they assist during childbirth and during cesarean sections. They work under the supervision of an obstetrician or surgeon, administering anesthesia to women as they prepare to give birth or before they undergo a cesarean, a surgical procedure that requires the same amount of care as any other operation. Complications can arise during even seemingly routine births, so nurse anesthetists working in this setting must be skilled in monitoring vital signs for both mother and infant and providing emergency care when needed.\nWith the growth of ambulatory surgery centers, pain management clinics and other outpatient facilities, many nurse anesthetists work in these settings instead of hospitals. Nurses working at these facilities may focus on minor procedures that require only minimal anesthesia, reducing the need for them to obtain backup blood supplies or perform complicated emergency care such as inserting breathing tubes. They also frequently work at cosmetic surgery offices, providing anesthesia for patients undergoing procedures such as facelifts or liposuction.\nMany nurse anesthetists work outside the operating room. For example, hospitals sometimes administer anesthesia to patients undergoing diagnostic procedures such as an MRI or medical procedures such as cardiac catheterization. In this case, nurse anesthetists recommend options for respiratory care and intervene in emergency situations by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ventilation support.\nUniversity of Kansas: What Is a Nurse Anesthetist?\nWilliams, Ellie. \"Some of the Related Work Settings of a Nurse Anesthetist.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/related-work-settings-nurse-anesthetist-15899.html.

Click here to register.\nWhile universally agreeing to enforce sales tax collections on internet retailers, Connecticut's gubernatorial contenders continued to battle Wednesday over how to fix the state's finances and its economy.\nRepublican Bob Stefanowski, Democrat Ned Lamont and independent Oz Griebel sparred over income taxes, tolls, the health \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of Connecticut's economy, and the best ways to revitalize cities during a mid-morning forum with the state's merchants' association.\n\"This is my kind of crowd, a business crowd, people who have invested in Connecticut,\" Stefanowski, former chief financial officer of UBS Investment Bank and a senior executive at GE, told the roughly 100 members of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association gathered at The Bushnell in Hartford.\nStefanowski, who has centered his campaign on a pledge to deliver \"fundamental economic reform\" through tax cuts, insisted Connecticut's business climate is headed in the wrong direction.\n\"What has happened to this state over the last 20 years is inexcusable,\" he said. More importantly, Stefanowski added, he is convinced Lamont would order major tax hikes, following in the footsteps of outgoing Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\nThe GOP nominee repeated his oft-made pledge to phase out the state's income tax over the next eight years \u2014 even though that tax currently pays for slightly more than half of the budget's General Fund, and the state's finances, unless adjusted, are projected to run $2 billion in deficit in the first fiscal year after the election. He also would eliminate the estate and business entity taxes.\nWhen asked for examples of how he would eliminate waste in state government, Stefanowski said he would try to remove unnecessary administrative posts in all agencies and departments, and would curtail or cease operation of the New Britain-to-Hartford busway.\n\"I think it's a false promise to tell you we're going to eliminate the income tax,\" Lamont said, repeating his frequent warning that even attempting a phase-out would drain huge dollars from municipal aid and higher education, creating \"skyrocketing property taxes\" and decimating community colleges.\nLamont, a Greenwich cable television entrepreneur, said he would not raise income or sales tax rates, but would consider repealing some existing sales tax exemptions. Lamont also plans to ease income taxes on middle-income households by boosting the property tax credit.\nBut while Lamont doesn't see Connecticut's business climate as perfect \u2014 government regulation suffers from \"a bad case of the slows\" \u2014 he sees things far more optimistically than Stefanowski does. \"This state is turning around and going in the right direction,\" Lamont added.\nWhile Stefanowski opposes tolls and labels them \"a tax on tires,\" Lamont said his plan to place tolls only on tractor-trailer trucks would enable Connecticut to catch up on at least some of the infrastructure rebuild it has deferred for too many years.\nGriebel, a former CEO of the Hartford MetroAlliance, questioned how seriously both of his rivals are taking Connecticut's fiscal and economic challenges.\nWhen it comes to Stefanowski's income tax pledge, Griebel called it \"a lot of utter nonsense.\"\nAs for tolls, the independent candidate \u2014 who chaired the former state Transportation Strategy Board \u2014 quipped, \"I've been for tolls since Napoleon was a pup.\"\nE"}

It tells us all we need to know\u2014for now, anyway\u2014about what Washington is up to as it puts Russia in an illegal police chokehold. This will end neither soon nor well.\nOn Wednesday the president announced his out-of-nowhere move to lift sanctions against Cuba and reestablish diplomatic ties. I cannot be the only one to do this, either: I wept. Half a century of suffering pointlessly inflicted on a humane and very brave people will now come to an end.\nOn Thursday Obama signed HR 5859, the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, into law. One is always suspicious of bills with Boy Scouty names like this, and one is always justified: Obama just gave himself permission to inflict pointless suffering on the humane and very brave Russian people more or less arbitrarily and indefinitely. And in all our names, the Pentagon will now arm Ukraine with lethal weapons. Funny, the $350 million committed as an opener just about matches what Truman gave the Greek monarchists in 1947, so commencing the Cold War.\nLet us end the Cold War 90 miles off our coast and far too late. Let us prosecute it full bore against Russia and along its borders, far too irrationally and nostalgically. I find one key to Washington\u2019s reasoning, if this is the word, on Russia in this contradiction, because it is apparent, not real.\nWith this statement a president who has consistently betrayed principle and common decency in deploying American power abroad went some way to redeeming himself in my household. Egypt, Syria, endless indulgence of Israel, the fight with China over the Pacific sphere of influence, those aggressively corporate trade deals Washington wants to impose across both oceans\u2014and now the opening to Cuba: This guy has the lumpiest foreign policy record of any president I can recall, but he bested 10 predecessors when he reached his hand across the water to Havana.\nSo went our 44th president\u2019s 24 hours in the sun.\nThe Ukraine bill, a straight-ahead cave to unreconstructed cold warriors on Capitol Hill, ranks among Obama\u2019s most craven and cowardly foreign policy decisions. Sanctions are pointless on Wednesday, but let us provide for more of them on Thursday because the Russophobes, blunt instruments all, require them.\nThe Russian press wants to think Obama signed the Ukraine bill reluctantly. I want to think the Cuba move was an expression of who the man buried in America\u2019s version of the deep state truly is. Maybe we are both right. But the Russian press and I have to get off the question of obscured intent. In the end this is a distraction.\nObama\u2019s State Department and Treasury are not stocked with end-of-history neoliberals by coincidence or some kind of carryover from the Bush II years. They are staffed as they are because Obama subscribes as avidly as any of them to the neoliberal agenda.\nI celebrate the Cuba opening: Triumphantly right for the wrong reason. I join a swelling number of Europeans in condemning Obama\u2019s new provision for extending sanctions against Russia: It is abjectly wrong for the same wrong reason. Tactics are all that is at issue. Strategy remains constant.\nThere is no reason whatever to expect the Cuban leadership to change in consequence of normalization. I stand with Sen. Marco Rubio and the rest of the Castrophobes on this point.\nI depart on"}

He is the founder of the social venture Ethos Water and the non-profit organization Giving Water.\nThum had the idea for Ethos Water in 2001 while working for McKinsey & Company on a project in South Africa where he saw water issues firsthand. Thum led Ethos as President through its acquisition by Starbucks in 2005. From 2005 to 2008, he managed Ethos and other businesses as a vice president of Starbucks and guided its philanthropy as a Director of the Starbucks Foundation.\nStarbucks donates US$0.05 per bottle sold to the Ethos Water mission. To date, Ethos Water has generated more than $6.2 million for water programs around the world, helping more than 420,000 people get access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene education.\nThum\u2019s current venture is called Fonderie 47, which buys up AK-47s in Africa, smelts the metal down to make jewelry.\nPeter Thum: We think of water being available, as being free, as being a human right. And yet at the same time, we abuse the availability of water.\nI think it\u2019s going to become a significantly greater problem than most of the other problems that we have. And the levels at which we consume water and the levels at which we consume energy aren\u2019t sustainable. If you stretch American behavior over the entire global population, and so we will collectively have to change.\nI was working for McKenzie in 2000. And I got an assignment to go work on a post-merger project in South Africa and I saw lots of different problems and met people both from other countries doing development work there as well as people from South Africa.\nThere was a time when I was driving down a road in South Africa where I distinctly remember driving past this woman on a dusty road and she was carrying a large pot of water on her head. And it was clear to me that she was very far away from wherever she had come from and from wherever she was going. And I think that was the moment where I thought something has to change so that people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t like this anymore.\nAnd not long after I got back from Africa, I was assigned to a project to work for a company that produced soda, bottled water. And I was looking specifically at a few product categories and I was looking at bottled water and I realized that much of the consumption of bottled water and the use of brands was about people looking for emotional benefits. And so I thought, there might be a way to create a brand that effectively would be a funding and communications platform. And that became Ethos, which ultimately was bought by Starbucks.\nAfter we were acquired by Starbucks, when we went from giving away hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of dollars to scaling the business and giving away a million dollars. And now, probably something like 100 million people in the U.S. and Canada have bought Ethos and it\u2019s generated several million dollars worth of funding to give water to about half a million people around the world.\nIn creating Ethos, the whole premise was we\u2019ll use consumer behavior to tackle a social issue. At the same time, the people who you would think would naturally be excited about the mission that we were pursuing, providing water to people around the world are also very concerned about the environment.\nI think the number one concern that people have and the thing that people harp on about Ethos Water is that it participates in an industry that is"}

He is a UNRWA alumnus.\nBeila Rabinowitz co-authored this article.\nMohammed Assaf, the 24 year old UNRWA resident who won the Arab Idol song competition, has become an overnight and worldwide sensation.\nThe song has reverberated with UNRWA and the UN, as the former appointed Assaf their first ever \u201cRegional Youth Ambassador for Palestine Refugees\u201d and \u201cGoodwill Ambassador For Peace\u201d. PA President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas called upon Palestinian Arabs to support Assaf in his bid to win the Arab Idol contest and welcomed him as a hero after his victory, hosting him at PA headquarters in Ramallah and designating him an \u201chonorary ambassador\u201d.\nBesides his voice and vocal extremism, Mohammed Assaf's claim to fame is that he is a graduate of UNRWA schools, his mother was an UNRWA teacher and he was born in the \u201crefugee\u201d camp of Khan Younis in the now Hamas-controlled Gaza, also under the aegis of UNRWA.\nUNRWA Commissionar General Phillipo Grandi welcomed Assaf to his organization's Gaza headquarters and expressed his pride that Assaf was a product of UNRWA camps and schools.\nIn Gaza, where Mohammed Assaf grew up, Hamas and UNRWA have reached a modus vivendi in which UNRWA agrees to let Hamas have its way and refrains from interfering with their Islamist agenda - which includes the takeover of the UNRWA workers union by the terrorist group.\n\u201cFor the moment, Hamas and UNWRA seem to have an agreement that UNRWA may continue to function in Gaza so long as it does not engage in actions that significantly contradict Hamas' world view,\" one former senior UNRWA official, talking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News...\"\nAccording to Al Jazeera: \u201cHis songs have even softened the hearts of some members of Hamas, which was reported to have once arrested him for publicly singing pro-Fatah numbers. In the run-up to the reality show's finale, Hamas - which controls Gaza - threw its support behind Assaf, calling him 'an ambassador for Palestinian art'\".\nAssaf, the Hamas-acclaimed \u201cambassador of Palestinian art\u201d is also a proponent of Palestinian Arab violence and jihadist propaganda.\nIn a music video entitled \u201cYa Halili Ya Mali\u201d which was filmed in the Burej UNRWA \u201crefugee camp\u201d, Assaf is wearing a t-shirt with a gold keffiyah emblazoned on it while swinging prayer beads (symbol of the 99 names of Allah) as a slingshot and can be seen at around 29 seconds into the video brandishing a sharp knife. The chorus of the song is reminiscent of those in jihad videos and accompanied by an ominous and militaristic drumbeat.\nIn his public comments, UNRWA's Goodwill and Peace Ambassador has made no secret of the murderous nationalist aspirations he shares with fellow Palestinian Arabs, like them claiming victim status and faithfully parotting UNRWA's grievance-mongering agenda.\n\"A revolution is not just the one carrying the rifle, it is the paintbrush of an artist, the scalpel of a surgeon, the ax of the farmer,\" he said. \"Everyone struggles"}
{"idx": "31773", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: My name is Jeff Hutchings and over the past 14 years I have run a nursery, initially selling alpines but by chance was introduced to hardy orchids in 2002. By 2006 I had specialised in terrestrial hardy orchids and changed the name to Laneside Hardy Orchids. Now I offer one of the largest selections of hardy orchids for sale in Europe. All plants are flowering size unless specifically identified.\nInitially, information on growing the different genus was hard to find and much related to conditions far different than found in the UK. It was only by trial and many errors that I found the right conditions and compost for each of the genus I was trying to grow. With the information I have obtained over time I can now provide customers with quality plants, growing in suitable composts and with written cultivation instructions to help the grower successfully grow their purchases.\nTo assist those interested in growing these fascinating orchids I have put information on this site and have published a number of booklets for specific groups or environmental situations. In addition I wrote a booklet \"Growing Hardy Orchids in a Garden or meadow\". Over 1000 copies have been sold and three additions printed. I am currently fully updating it and hope to publish a much larger book at the end of the year.\nThe web shop started some years ago as a simple list from which customers selected their orchids and sent in an order by letter. This brand new site provides the buyer with information to aid successful cultivation, a list of all the orchids we stock at different times of the year. Now there is a Facebook page which you can read without registering with Facebook. I will be writing useful information several times a week to help growers. The monthly newsletter will be re-introduced and sent to all registered customers. The new system should help ensure that the newsletter actually reaches customers and is not blocked by the various internet providers.\nCustomers who are not happy using online payment systems can place an order online and then pay, either by sending a cheque or telephoning to pay by card.\nOne of the problems with hardy orchid sales is that in many instances only a few legal plants are available from those nurseries who grow from seed each year. I do not buy in any orchids from dubious sources. I offer plants for sale on the web shop immediately I get confirmation of my order with the growers but do not send out plants until they are fully dormant. This is the same for me with the growers, I have to wait until plants are dormant before getting delivery.\nFrom past experience, it is not sensible to send the plants out when conditions are not suitable, so I ask customers to be patient. You will get your plants in good condition at the right time of the year. This may be some time after your order is placed. On the web page for each plant there is information on when plants can be sent out This is the time when plants can be sent out when dormant or semi-dormant. Most of the plants sent out to UK addresses are sent potted. All cypripediums are sent out in 2 ltr pots of a mix which has proved very reliable over the years.\nOver the years I have built up a show schedule which includes some of the major shows in the country including the London Orchid Show, Harrogate Flower Show and RHS Tatton along with a number of shows organised by individual orchid societies and the Alpine Garden Society. The highlight is the Malvern International Orchid Show which is the largest orchid show in the United Kingdom. In addition I give"}

Col. Renae Hilton, an Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent on Joint Base Andrews, Md. He was a Navy officer but resigned his commission after his daughter was born with disabilities in 2002.\nIn addition to being a stay-at-home dad, Hilton has been instrumental in bringing to light the challenges faced by military families with special needs, especially those with autism.\n\"A recent National Council on Disability Military Family Study concluded far-reaching systemic changes are needed in our nation's health, education and long-term service systems to address the significant barriers faced by exceptional family members,\" Hilton said. \"This hearing is a critical step in addressing and acting on these extraordinarily important issues to our military families.\"\nCaring for a child with a disability can be both expensive and stressful, leading many military families to require waiver assistance for their children, Hilton said. However, Medicaid waiver wait lists are often long.\n\"Every time a military family moves, they go to the bottom of the next state's wait list,\" Hilton said, who pointed out that many military families rarely reach the top before moving again.\nThe military spouse offered some potential solutions, to include a military Medicaid waiver, an interstate compact addressing portability, allowing service members to maintain wait list eligibility based on their home of record, and extending benefits provided under TRICARE's Extended Care Health Option, or ECHO.\nOne ECHO benefit Hilton addressed is an autism treatment known as applied behavior analysis. Applied behavior analysis is a method of behavioral conditioning that teaches and reinforces desired behaviors. The technique has been found to help teach new skills and improve communication abilities for children with autism spectrum disorders.\nGuice said the Department of Defense implemented a demonstration project in 2008 to determine if TRICARE could expand the availability of applied behavior analysis providers and is now in the process of converting the demonstration project into a permanent part of the ECHO program.\nHilton said military families are grateful for the ECHO benefit, but they would like to see it updated and made more flexible.\n\"What we look forward to is enhanced functionality and flexibility of the ECHO program,\" Hilton said, pointing out that ECHO benefits are only available for dependents of active-duty service members. Therefore, dependents of military retirees are unable to access applied behavior analysis treatments under TRICARE.\nHilton said he hopes the committee will take such issues under consideration, as it considers the fiscal 2013 National Defense Appropriations Act, in order to help military children with special needs.\n\"It is an amazing privilege to be able to represent a million-plus military spouses and their families,\" Hilton said. \"In the end, we ask that our children are not penalized for the service their mother or father renders to the nation.\""}

In 2015, the governor announced that with the economy in a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d it would be unable to repay the roughly $72 billion it owed, and last year, Congress enacted the PROMESA law, which acted as a kind of bankruptcy protection (as a territory, Puerto Rico is not allowed to declare bankruptcy).

Felix - The Australian government has prohibited the entry of food and non-food products coming from all ports of the Philippines except Manila because of the alleged presence of giant African snails (GAS) in container vans that reached Australia\u2019s ports in recent months.\nAlready, Cebu\u2019s furniture exporters, are starting to feel the pinch with close to $6 million worth of products, including processed seaweeds, were barred from entering Australia because of the new import restrictions imposed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).\nAQIS recently included the Philippines in its list of \"high-risk\" GAS countries which require mandatory inspection before containers are released to prevent transporting the voracious snails which are considered as an agricultural pest.\nAustralian quarantine authorities have imposed more rigid inspection rules because of the reported presence of GAS in several container vans reaching its ports. However, the reports are unclear if all the infested containers came from the Philippines.\nGAS can live up to six years. They feed on leaves, tubers, on many types of crops and ornamentals as well as organic matter, excreta and any organic refuse. They can become destructive to crops if left unchecked. The snail pest can be easily transported between countries. It attaches itself to containers, secondhand vehicles, used machinery, empty bottles and other materials which have been left lying on the ground for sometime. It is extremely difficult to eradicate this pest from an area once it has become established.\nCebu furniture exporters said they were never informed of this new development and became aware of it only when international shipping lines such as Maersk Sealand stopped accepting shipments to Australia from all Philippine ports such as General Santos, Davao, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro and Subic.\nCebu\u2019s exporters are initiating talks with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Agriculture to press Australia to reconsider its new import restrictions.\nShemberg Marketing Corp. which exports processed seaweed or carrageenan to Australia, stands to lose about $5 million monthly if the ban continues.\nThe other countries listed as high-risk GAS countries are East Timor, Hawaiian Islands, Guam, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesian countries such as Tahiti, Moorea and Society Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia, New Caledonia and Vanuatu."}

{"idx": "31785", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: What is the relationship between flood insurance and business interruption insurance?\nThere is no relationship between the two. A flood insurance policy is designed to insure you for physical damage to your buildings or contents. If you have a business interruption policy, you will see a total flood exclusion, even though you will most likely be covered for any wind damage or wind-driven rain damage. Your basic flood policy isn\u2019t going to afford any coverage for business interruption, unfortunately.\nIf a business owner has a business interruption policy that they buy for hurricane season, for example, but they don\u2019t have a flood policy, are any of the interruptions to their business going to be covered by their business interruption policy?\nNo. The actual payment for business interruption, i.e. the cost of running your business and lost profits, none of that will be covered. (Business owners) should buy flood insurance first. It will allow you to repair your building and put you back in business faster. You can carry up to $500,000 in flood coverage for your building, as well as $500,000 worth of flood coverage on its contents, which in most cases can make businesses whole after a flood.\nAlthough lenders may not require flood insurance because you\u2019re not in a flood zone, obviously as we\u2019ve seen in the Baton Rouge area and with Hurricane Katrina, you still have a chance of flooding. The first decision business owners have to make is, are they willing to pay the money for flood insurance if the chances for damage aren\u2019t necessarily as high as they would be for a fire, but the damage can be just as bad? Even if it\u2019s a one in 100-year storm, it could come in the next six months. You never know.\nIf you have wind coverage on your property policy and you can\u2019t get into your business because of a wind event, i.e. hurricane or other named storm, you can get business interruption coverage. But for flood damage, there is no coverage under a flood policy for your lack of revenue or the cost of paying your employees while your business is shut down. The way to ensure that you\u2019re not shut down for that long is to have your flood policy do what it was designed to do and give you the money to repair your business.\nWhat are some tips to work with your adjuster?\nThe first thing to do is to make sure you take pictures of everything \u2013 inside, outside, how high the water is, or photos of the water line on the walls, as well as all the contents in the building that were there before, during and after the event.\nBe cooperative and patient with the adjuster. In a mass event, with hundreds to thousands of potential claims, they\u2019re coming out to a property that is one of 40 or 50 they may have to visit that day. So although it can seem like a mechanical process, they certainly have your best interest in mind, and getting full cooperation is the best way to insure they have evaluated everything as you would like.\nWho should be the point of contact for the adjuster/insurance claims process in the organization?\nIn a normal flood event, the owner of the business is the best person because they\u2019re able to make a decision without having to consult with anyone else. But in a situation like what\u2019s happened in Baton Rouge, they are also going to be the busiest person after the event, dealing with a lot of other things beyond monitoring claims \u2013 making sure customers are sure the business is coming back, or maybe their home flooded or a family member\u2019s home flooded and they need to take care of that as well.\nIf there is someone the owner"}

Hite Jr. said after the SRC meeting.\n\"We have not seen zero tolerance be very effective, particularly for younger students,\" said SRC Chair Marjorie Neff.\nThe changes are \"not saying there can't be consequences for not wearing your uniform,\" she added. \"It's saying we're not excluding students from school.\"\nThe Student Code of Conduct was amended to read, \"Kindergartners shall not be suspended unless their actions result in serious bodily injury, and those suspensions shall not be more than three days without an assistant superintendent's approval.\"\nAlex Dutton, an attorney with the nonprofit Education Law Center, said the SRC should also restrict the use of suspensions for first and second graders.\nCiting numbers from the state Office of Safe Schools, Dutton told the SRC that last year 448 Philadelphia kindergartners, 1,500 first graders, and 1,900 second graders were suspended. Ninety percent of those suspensions were for nonviolent offenses, Dutton said.\n\"Research has affirmatively demonstrated that students who are suspended at an early age are more likely to face future educational barriers and challenges, like discipline, truancy, and school dropout - all of which predict a student's entry into the school-to-prison pipeline,\" he said.\nAlso supporting the changes enacted Thursday were the American Civil Liberties Union, the Philadelphia Student Union, and Youth United for Change.\nSchool officials told Dutton that although they also support curtailing suspensions of first and second graders, that can't happen this year because teachers in those grades have not received the necessary training in conflict resolution and other discipline strategies.\nUnder the new policy, which goes into effect this school year, suspensions will be replaced by interventions, said Karyn Lynch, chief of student support services.\nStudents' failure to wear uniforms often is the result of poverty-related factors, such as homelessness and lacking the facilities to wash clothes, she said in an interview. Therefore, teachers, counselors, nurses, and other school personnel are being trained to work with students on addressing the issues that cause them to violate the dress code policy, Lynch said.\nShe noted national statistics indicate a disproportionate number of black and brown boys get suspended, which the federal government has asked school districts to address. Chicago and Baltimore have already restricted suspensions for the youngest students and have reported positive results, she said.\nIn other news, Hite announced that 700 new teachers had been hired for the school year that begins Sept. 7, and that 97 percent of teaching vacancies had been filled.\nHe also reminded parents that the registration period for kindergartners and all other students opens Monday.

He told ZDNet UK's sister site, silicon.com, that a prototype RFID tag will be tested in an airport in Hungary next month.\nThe exact date of an airport rollout of the technology is still unknown but Brennan said if the Hungarian trials are a success and someone takes on the tech, it could arrive in airports within two years.\nBrennan said Optag has been designed to improve airport security, with the ability to track the movement of suspicious passengers and bar them from entering restricted areas.\nThe ability to locate individuals could also aid airports in an evacuation situation, he said, and in finding lost children and passengers who are late to the departure gate.\nOptag is different from its RFID predecessors \u2014 standard RFID devices only have a range of a few centimetres but Optag has a range of 10 to 20m and can be located within a radius of 1m, Brennan said.\nThe Optag project is now nearing completion but there are still some sizeable hurdles to real-world implementation, including working out how to get the tags working in an airport and how to ensure people wear them, as well as allaying concerns over civil liberty infringements, said Brennan.\nHe added the device is \"not intended to know who's doing what, although it might be that security needs to pinpoint certain individuals\".\nThe design of the object set to carry the Optag is still not finalised. Brennan said RFID-tagged wristbands could be used but these can be taken off and swapped between individuals.\nA possible option is to use cameras to scan the tag-wearer's face, to check it matches the person given the device, but these could only be used in certain areas of an airport, according to Brennan.\nBrennan said the installation of the systems required to run Optag would also be very disruptive to existing airports \u2014 but with a new airport, or, for example, Heathrow's T5, installation could occur during construction.\nThe current tag does not store any data but might incorporate biometric data in the future, Brennan added.\nOptag is primarily aimed at improving airport security but Brennan said \"anywhere where a large number of people are, this has applications\"."}

Intel&apos;s marketing claim that these chips delivered \"the experience of Intel Core in fanless form factors\" was something of a stretch. However, it was a reasonable first step.\nAccording to Geekbench 4, the Core M-5Y71-based 12-inch MacBook (the Core M-5Y71 is the fastest of the Broadwell-based Core M chips) achieves a single-core score of 3251 and a multi-core score of 5691. Apple&apos;s fastest shipping processor at the time -- the A8X -- achieved a single-core score of 1833 and a multi-core score of 4001.\nIt looks to me that despite Savov&apos;s claim that the original Core M chip was \"underpowered,\" Apple wasn&apos;t really fielding anything better at the time.\nLater in 2015, Apple released the A9X chip, and Intel released a second-generation set of Core M processors based on a new architecture. The A9X was quite impressive, achieving a single-core score of 3150 and a multi-core score of 4893 -- almost as good as the first-generation Core M chip that Savov dissed.\nThe second-generation Core M-6Y75, in the same Geekbench 4 test, achieves a single-core score of 3715 and a multi-core score of 6974 -- solidly ahead of the older Core M chip, as well as Apple&apos;s A9X. This score is also better than what the A10 Fusion is able to put up (though if I were Intel, I would probably be sweating the fact that a smartphone processor is able to come this close to a late 2015 fan-less notebook/2-in-1 processor).\nIntel has already announced the successor to the Core M-6Y75, known as the Core i7-7Y75, which should pull even further ahead of the A9X. That being said, I do expect Apple&apos;s upcoming A10X to be very close in performance to the i7-7Y75 (in Geekbench 4, my guess is that single-core performance between the two will be similar, with Intel pulling ahead in multi-core performance), which should be an excellent achievement for Apple.\nApple is good --really good.

Their duty, however, is not to uphold the integrity of the act. That's our duty.\"\nSessions noted that \"of course\" the system \"must always respect the rights of aliens\" in the courts. But he also warned the judges of \"fake claims.\"\n\"Just as we defend immigrant legal rights, we reject unjustified and sometimes fake claims,\" Sessions said. \"The law is never serviced when deceit is rewarded so that the fundamental principles of the law are defeated.\"\nThe comments came in the context of Sessions' repeated moves to exert his unique authority over the immigration courts, a separate legal system for immigrants that is entirely run by the Justice Department.\nSessions approves every judge hired and can instruct them on how to interpret law, and thus decide cases, as well as how to manage cases. He has used that authority multiple times in the past year, including issuing a sweeping ruling that will substantially narrow the types of cases that qualify for asylum protections in the US. Those decisions overrode the evolution of years of immigration judges' and the immigration appellate board's decisions.\nSessions reminded the new judges of that authority and those decisions in his remarks, saying he believes they are \"correct\" and \"prudent\" interpretations of the law that \"restores\" them to the original intent.\nThe president of the union for immigration judges called Sessions' comments \"really troubling and problematic,\" noting that the judges' union has disagreed with many of Sessions' moves as exerting too much influence over the courts and jeopardizing their fundamental responsibility of fairness.\n\"We just find it really troubling and problematic that the AG just does not seem to appreciate the distinction that we have as immigration judges from the rest of the department, both the US attorney's office and the Department of Homeland Security,\" said Ashley Tabaddor, of the National Association of Immigration Judges. \"We are not one and the same as them.\"\nIn the immigration court system, the judges are employed by the Justice Department, and the attorneys serving as prosecutors work for the Department of Homeland Security.

Ben Bernanke's term as chairman is set to expire in January.\nObama told the Times he wanted someone who would go beyond tracking inflation and focus on market stability.\n\"The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better,\" he said. \"I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, Let's make sure that we're growing the economy.\"\nHe disputed Republicans' claims about job creation should the controversial Keystone pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast be constructed. The 2,000 temporary construction jobs he predicted - far less than the 20,000 some Republicans have said to expect - would be a \"a blip relative to the need\" for job creation.\nHe suggested that concerns over the pipeline's environmental impact could be addressed to his satisfaction because \"there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.\"\nIn the interview, the president acknowledged that people are \"anxious\" and \"frustrated\" about their own financial future even while the economy overall improves.\nSome do not see the potential for upward mobility, which he called \"part and parcel of who we were as Americans.\"\nIt predates the fiscal crises of the last decade, he said, and despite the bloated national debt, the federal government's austerity measures have hurt the government's ability to effect change in diverse areas such as climate change and immigration.\n\"I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three"}

Here's what to do if one of yours calls it quits.\nThe past decade has seen an explosion in new exchange-traded funds (ETF). Investors have flocked to ETFs because they trade like individual stocks but offer the diversification benefits of mutual funds \u2014 all at a low cost.\nBut not all funds attract investors, and ETFs are dying off at a near-record rate this year. Fund closures can create a costly hassle for investors.\nHere\u2019s what to do if you face an ETF closure \u2014 and how to avoid one in the future.\nThe industry\u2019s rapid growth resulted in some funds that proved to be too niche and failed to attract investors. Through September, 132 ETFs have permanently stopped trading this year, only six fewer than the record of 138 in 2017, according to data from ETF.com. Even so, the number of new funds launched year-to-date, 189, still outpaces closures.\nIf you stick with the largest ETFs that track broad market gauges (like the S&P 500) or major asset classes (like bonds), you may never encounter a fund closure. But, if you get more creative when shopping for ETFs, you could get burned.\nIf the company overseeing an ETF in your portfolio decides to close it, you are a soon-to-be former shareholder. Perhaps the fund is liquidating because it didn\u2019t generate investor interest or attract sufficient assets to cover administrative costs; regardless, the manager no longer sees a viable business case for the ETF.\nThe ETF provider generally will announce the fund\u2019s closure by sending notice to shareholders, listing dates when it will stop trading and when its assets will be liquidated.\nSell. Until the ETF stops trading, you can sell shares like normal. The fund will continue to track its underlying index, which helps ensure that its price won\u2019t plummet to zero just because of the closure announcement. While you may wish to execute a limit order specifying a minimum selling price, there\u2019s a finite window to execute the trade, so you may not get your desired price.\nAwait liquidation. You can also simply wait for the fund to be liquidated after its final trading day. The managers will sell all holdings in the fund, settle other obligations and divvy up the balance among remaining shareholders. The price per share from liquidation could differ from the fund\u2019s last trading price, so be aware of this risk.\nThe biggest hassle of an ETF closure is it upends your investment timeline, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. You are forced to sell or take liquidation proceeds, which can create a tax burden or lock in investment losses.\nYou may incur a capital-gains tax on profits if the ETF is in a taxable account, that is, a nonretirement account. If you owned the fund less than a year, the profit will be taxed at your normal tax rate. If you owned it for longer than a year, you will pay a lower long-term capital gains rate. On the other hand, if you sell for less than you bought, your loss on this investment can offset gains on others. Ask your tax preparer for advice.\nYou have plenty of options for ETFs that have very little risk of closing among the top 100 largest ETFs.\n\u2022 Total assets, the amount of money the ETF has attracted in investment.\n\u2022 Average volume, the average number of shares that trade each day.\n\u2022 Inception"}

But he is peaking at the right moment. A horse that is on his best day and on equal footing with the other horses will be hard to beat. I am not handing him the race yet. He\u2019s going to have to earn it.\nQ: Which will be harder for Super Saver to win\u2014the Preakness or Belmont?\nA: Going to Belmont will be tricky because he has so many horses laying in the gap for him. Nick Zito has two of them: Ice Box, who would have won the Kentucky Derby if he had a good trip, now he gets to rest for five weeks and pounce on him at the Belmont; and Fly Down, who just won the Dwyer Stakes, is very impressive. But the Preakness is no easy win this year.\nA: This is an unusual Preakness because, traditionally, new shooters, horses that did not run in the Derby, do not do well. But there\u2019s a good group this year. Caracortado got into a little trouble at the Santa Anita Derby, but had all the credentials of the Derby horses and just decided to wait for the Preakness. He has [a]chance to run his best race Saturday. And Pleasant Prince is a nice horse that just fell short of the earnings after losing by a nose to Ice Box in the Florida Derby.\nQ: Will a jockey switch help Lookin At Lucky?\nA: (Derby jockey) Garret Gomez is one of the best jockeys in the world for a reason. He might have lost confidence in that colt a little bit, but I think the colt kind of creates his own bad luck a little bit in that he is pretty laid back. He does have the quick acceleration, but it takes him a couple of seconds to decide to use it. So maybe Garrett\u2019s lost faith in the colt, but I don\u2019t believe Martin Garcia is a better rider than Gomez.\nQ: Coolers are still not allowed, but its $20 all the beer you can drink this year.

Though at times the term can still be considered a buzzword, brands are not only seeing but understanding the value purpose can bring to the bottom line in the form of enthusiastic consumers. On the conference circuit, more panels and discussions revolve around brand purpose, and the accumulated wisdom circulates throughout the marketing ecosystem. In essence, a living playbook is emerging at agencies and brands.\nBut what about the next generation of marketers\u2014especially those who have yet to gain valuable work experience and insight into brand purpose? In the academic world, several colleges and universities have outstanding brand leadership programs, yet only one school, the University of Oregon\u2019s School of Journalism and Communications (SOJC), has a dedicated master\u2019s program, the first of its kind, in advertising and brand responsibility.\nLast month, at 72andSunny in Los Angeles, the first cohort of the SOJC\u2019s program spent a day at the agency to learn, first-hand, about how brands, and especially agencies, are approaching purpose in their output for clients. A mix of agency leaders from 72andSunny, TBWA\\Media Arts Lab and others gave 10-minute talks covering a range of issues including innovation, technology, talent and more. Additionally, Sebastian Buck, co-founder of Los Angeles agency Enso, gave an insightful keynote that charted his own journey and shared how purpose and creativity can lead to impact, giving examples of purpose-led client work from the likes of Khan Academy and Google.\nThe day-long event, which featured many University of Oregon alumni, was the culmination of a journey that began five years ago. At a faculty retreat in 2014, Kim Sheehan, the director of the program, and Deb Morrison, the SOCJ\u2019s Carolyn Silva Chambers Distinguished Professor of Advertising, sensed an opportunity to move the relatively nascent brand purpose conversation forward.\nThe origins of the program began with one class in green brand strategy, which focused on how brands connected with the environment. As more students gravitated to that class, Sheehan and Morrison found that they were interested in learning more about brands and their impact on the world. From there, they determined that the best way forward was a master\u2019s in brand responsibility.\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to be different than every other master\u2019s programs,\u201d said Sheehan.\nOne of the catalysts to get the program off the ground in the first place was Steve O\u2019Leary, vice chairman of The Shipyard agency in Newport Beach, Calif. He saw a trend and evolution of responsibility and purpose bubbling up and helped consult on the program and push it through.\nOnce the master\u2019s program was established, Sheehan, who spent several years in agency leadership before she arrived to teach in Eugene, Oreg., in 1998, sent out an announcement about it on an academic listserv to test the waters. She received dozens of emails applauding the move. Interestingly, Sheehan estimates that around a third of those who will be part of the program\u2019s second cohort called out the fact that they wanted to work for a certified B-Corp."}

A new report suggests that the iconic spacecraft has a strong chance of enduring through the mid-2020s.\n\"Right now, all of the subsystems and the instruments have a reliability exceeding 80 percent through 2025,\" Hubble mission head Thomas Brown of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland told Space.com. Brown presented the results of the engineering report on the telescope's reliability here at the semiannual meeting of the American Astronomical Society on Jan. 10.\n\"[WFC3] will come back to science, but we want to do it carefully,\" Brown said.\nAfter the telescope's 1990 launch, Hubble's primary mirror was diagnosed with a flaw that produced fuzzy images rather than the crisp photos needed for science. Fortunately, the spacecraft was designed to be serviced by astronauts. Thanks to their intervention, and a set of replacement instruments that could correct for the error much as a pair of glasses can correct a person's vision trouble, Hubble has sent beautiful images back to Earth for more than 25 years.\nOne reason the spacecraft has lasted so long is that astronauts have provided aid. Servicing missions continued to update the telescope until 2009, when the space shuttle was retired.\nThe final update to Hubble included the installation of two brand-new instruments, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and WFC3. The astronauts on Servicing Mission 4 also performed on-site repairs for the telescope's two other instruments, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), both of which had stopped working. The astronauts additionally replaced Hubble's 18-year-old batteries with new ones; installed six new gyroscopes, whose job is turning the telescope; and added a brand-new Fine Guidance System to point the instrument.\nAstronauts also covered Hubble's equipment bays with insulating panels and installed a device that will help to guide the observatory down when its mission comes to an end.\nEven after 10 years in space, WFC3 and COS still have all of their backup systems online, which should help to extend their lifetimes. \"If the redundancy systems are [as] reliable [as the primaries], we can still get plenty of years out of them as well,\" Brown said.\nACS and STIS are both older than WFC3 and COS and have already implemented some of their redundancies. Still, Brown expects those older instruments to continue working well into the future, pointing out that both were rated at greater than 80 percent reliability.\nThe report estimated the iconic Hubble's reliability after examining components on the ground that have experienced similar wear and tear. But despite that prediction, it's still possible for a major accident to end the spacecraft's mission prematurely.\nFor instance, in late 2018, Hubble had issues withone of its gyroscopes. The telescope's team was able to resolve the issue without switching to a backup system. Brown said that even if they hadn't been able to fix the malfunctioning component, the team on the ground had come up with other ways to"}

He ex- empts all persons whose property does not amount to 100/. in one shape or other ; he finds by Parliamentary returns that the total amount of property belonging to persons who possess more than that sum is probably 6,700,000,0001.; and a tax of 88. annually imposed upon every 100/., he calculates, would yield about 27,000,000/. sterling. This is his plan.\nThe whole drift of his speech is, to represent that at present \"the poorer classes,\" \"the labouring classes,\" pay an undue share of the taxation of the country, because they consume the larger portion of articles subject to Customs and Excise duties. Thus he reckons that upon the articles tea, sugar, and tobacco, the upper classes pay considerably less than one-third, the middle classes something more, and the working classes still more. Of the whole Customs and Excise, taken at 42,000,000/., the upper classes pay 7,350,0001., the middle 15,960,000/., and the poor 18,690,000/. In another part of his speech Mr. Bright represents \"the poor\" as the unenfranehised. Of the 24,000,000 of people in the United Kingdom, he reckons that 18,000,000 of persons live in houses under 10/. value, and only 6,000,000 in better houses ; the 18,000,000 consuming more of the heavily taxed articles to which he has referred. His budget, therefore, is re- presented as a plan for relieving the poor who are now said to pay the largest share, for relieving the unenfranchised, and making the enfranchised pay their way. He speaks of this plan as if it were to be wholly and exclu- sively a measure of relief.\n\"I will undertake to say, that there is not a man with the smallest idea of political economy who will attempt to deny that if the duties on tea, coffee, sugar, spirits, malt, tobacco, and those spirits mostly used by the great body of the people\u2014that if those duties were all repealed tonight, not only would there not be a single labouring man in Lancashire whose wages would fall, but I believe their wages would rise.\" Their wages would rise, of course, because there would be, he says elsewhere, a general extension of trade ; but let us see a little more of his explanation. in the course of the same speech, Mr. Bright professes himself unable to see through the argument which we have used ; that wheresoever the taxes are imposed, they are paid in something like an equal per centage by the entire body of the consuming classes, whatever their incomes may be. He calls this argument \" stuff: \" in order to enlighten him we will illustrate our meaning by passages from an economist whose reasoning he may perhaps adopt,\u2014though we will not answer for his doing so.

It\u2019s a place where women of all different backgrounds can come together for friendship and fellowship, and can be encouraged in their walk with the Lord.\nOr, at least, that\u2019s the goal.\nA lot of women I know, however, have been hurt by or disappointed in their WM experience. They\u2019ve been judged, excluded, or left spiritually empty. In some cases, women\u2019s ministry has left these women with a wrong impression of the Lord. Through the actions of women\u2019s groups, these ladies felt like the Lord was out-of-date, overly-harsh, and uncaring.\nTo keep women coming to church, we need to revamp our ministries and give them the friendship (with other women and with God) they crave. To help get our WM back on track, here are 10 things women\u2019s ministry should stop doing right now.\nOne of the worst reputations we\u2019ve received as Christians is being judgemental, and women\u2019s ministry is not exempt from this impression. While I do believe this judgment is usually a misunderstanding, I\u2019ve heard story after story from my friends who\u2019ve felt judged in women\u2019s ministries.\nThis judgment can show itself in many ways: ideas always being shot down, being discredited because of age (on either end of the spectrum), not feeling welcome because of a divorce, or even not being allowed to decorate a table for Christmas tea because their plates weren\u2019t \"classy enough.\"\nThe goal of our ministry should be to become a safe place for women to grow in their relationship with Jesus and with each other. But if we\u2019re not creating a welcoming environment for women, no matter their age, marital status, or income, we\u2019re going to leave a sour taste in women\u2019s mouths.\nOne thing I love about WM is how there always seems to be that one event that the women look forward to. It garners so much excitement that it seems like the entire church is buzzing for months before. Maybe it\u2019s a Christmas dinner, an annual outing, or the springtime retreat. Whatever it is, it\u2019s well respected and has been going on for years.\nWhere things go south, however, is when every single event turns into an annual tradition that carries more dread than anticipation.\nAs a creature of habit, I get it. It\u2019s nice to know your yearly schedule, to have a game plan, and to know your next event months ahead of time. But repeating all the same events is not only dull, but harmful to your ministry.\nFirst, you\u2019re not positioning your ministry in a way that\u2019s welcoming to new guests. Events should tailor-fit to your women, not the other way around. Plus, being overly scheduled can prevent you from leaving room for God to work. You always want to be seeking the Lord when planning your events, not just following last year's calendar.\nHave you ever compared men\u2019s and women\u2019s Bible studies side by side? It\u2019s ridiculous! Men have these incredibly powerful exegeses on God\u2019s Word and women are left with Bible studies centered around the theme of chocolate.\nIt\u2019s time kick this to the curb. Give me a robust year-long study on Romans. Teach me how to study the Scriptures efficiently. Let\u2019s look up the meanings of the original Greek words. Let\u2019s vigorously pray for one another. Let\u2019s become Christ-following, warrior-princesses who put on the armor of God every single day. And then, maybe give me some chocolate.\nWomen get a bad rap for being g"}

Email list sizes between 1,000 and 2,499 contacts generate average open rates of 31.19%, while email lists with more than 1 million contacts only generate open rates of 8.15%.\nSmaller email lists enables marketers to send messages with more finite segmentation, and an added degree of personalization.\nTriggered email messages also had significantly higher email engagement rates than traditional newsletters or RSS feeds, according to the GetResponse report, likely due to the added personalization factor. Triggered messages are sent after a customer makes a specific action online, such as participating in a webinar, downloading a product guide, or abandoning a product in a shopping cart. By nature, a triggered message is more personalized than a batch-and-blast mass email, so it should come as no surprise that it generates higher engagement rates than email newsletters.\nTriggered email messages have an average open rate of 56.67%, according to GetResponse, with an average click-through rate of 14.99% and a click-to-open rate of 25.99%. Newsletters, on the other hand, generate an average open rate of 22.03%, average click-through rates of 3.27%, and click-to-open rates of 14.84%.\nThe power of personalization is also evident in subject lines. Fewer than 10% of email subject lines are personalized, according to GetResponse\u2019s study, but those few emails generate higher open rates than their batch-and-blast brethren."}

{"idx": "31852", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Often an unknown telephone number flashes on your cellphone and the person on the other side identifies herself as an agent from a bank. She offers a pre-approved loan, which means that the bank has already sanctioned a loan which can be availed by doing minimal paperwork. These loans are of various types\u2014home, car or personal. For home loans, a sanction letter stating that an in-principle approval has been granted for a particular home loan amount is offered.\nThere are, however, various conditions attached to these loans.\nThe advantage of a pre-approved loan is that you know the amount a bank is ready to lend. So, you can look for a property or a vehicle accordingly. However, this loan can only be availed within a certain time frame. These offers are usually valid for six months but may vary from bank to bank.\nThe rate of interest offered initially is usually valid for a month. However, the bank may change the rate depending on the prevailing market rate after completion of a month. This change, too, varies from bank to bank.\nThe amount of loan approved depends on factors such as average balance in your savings account and the time duration for which you have been a customer of the bank. Since the bank has your details, it would mean less paperwork for you. It will also check your credit report and credit score to decide on the amount of loan. Processing of application is usually fast.\nSince these loans are pre-approved, most banks charge a processing fee but refund the same once the loan is availed. Some banks may charge a flat service fee of few thousand rupees for pre-approved sanction letter on home loans.\nApart from minimal paperwork and faster processing, you can get a slightly better deal in terms of interest rates. However, that may not always be true and so it\u2019s best to check with other lenders before opting for such loans. If you have a pre-approved home loan sanction letter, you are in a better position to negotiate with builders as you are ready to book a property immediately. Also, remember that banks will disburse the loan only if the property meets the approval criteria."}

They say not only is prisoner abuse widespread, but that much of it is carried out by Mr. Jabr's subordinates. Efforts to bring the problem under control during the past year have largely been frustrated by indifference from senior Iraqi officials, they say.\nPrivately, half a dozen US officers have acknowledged to the Monitor that prisoner abuse by Iraqi police is common.\nNow, one officer is speaking out. Major R. John Stukey, a US Army doctor who served in Baghdad from January to June, frequently visited Interior Ministry facilities on the east side of Baghdad to assess the health of prisoners. He says he personally treated about a dozen men who had been tortured and observed an environment of overcrowding and neglect.\nMany more of his patients alleged torture, but in most cases this couldn't be verified, since he often saw them for the first time months after their initial arrests and interrogations.\nIn one east Baghdad facility run by Iraq's Interior Ministry, a few miles from the secret jail that was raided by US forces on Nov. 13, Major Stukey says about 220 men were held in filthy conditions in a space so crowded that many couldn't lie down to sleep.\nStukey visited the facilities with members of the 720th US Military Police Battalion. The MPs filed frequent reports to their commanders about the ill-treatment and, Stukey says, did what they could to prevent torture and improve the prisoners' conditions. They made a point of distributing soap, toothbrushes, and Korans whenever they visited.\n\"We did report what we saw, but it was like trying to put out a forest fire with a bucket of water,'' says Stukey by telephone at Fort Rucker in Alabama, where he is currently based. \"The MPs submitted reports at least several times a week on detention issues. We knew about it, and we tried to change it, but it was just one of those things you had to deal with.\"\nOfficials from the 720th, now back at its base in Fort Hood, Texas, did not respond to requests for comment.\nCoalition troops, fighting a deadly insurgency, say they don't have the manpower to compel better behavior from their Iraqi partners, and that to do so would require them to court frequent conflict with their closest allies inside the country.\nThe Bush Administration has sent mixed messages on the subject. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that the US \"does not authorize or condone torture of detainees.\" The US has also signed the UN Convention Against Torture. But administration officials have also argued that the treaty rules on \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\" treatment do not apply outside US territory.\nThe tension over the US position was illustrated at a press conference with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Joint Chief of Staff Chairman Gen. Peter Pace on Nov. 29.\nWhen General Pace said, \"it's absolutely the responsibility of every US service member if they see inhumane treatment being conducted to intervene to stop it.\" Secretary Rumsfeld interjected, \"I don't think you mean they have an obligation to physically stop it; it's to report it.\"\n"}

First up, it excelled in the practicality stakes.\nWith the split-fold rear bench down, it offers copious space for a snowboard and all the gubbins that go with it, while still offering a suitable rear seat should it be needed.\nIn fact, the boot is so cavernous that, unlike other cars that have their rear view blocked by all the cold weather ancillaries needed for such a holiday, there is so much space that the view out of the back was completely unobstructed.\nTo prepare for the trip, I asked Volvo if they\u2019d help by fitting some winter tyres. The T8 hybrid model I\u2019m driving has all-wheel drive available as a setting when being used in electric mode, so I thought the addition of some grippier snow tyres would make it unstoppable.\nThe V90 returned from the workshop on the day I was due to depart, so after a cursory glance around the car and with the kit thrown into the back, I headed to Portsmouth to catch the Brittany ferry across the Channel.\nWhen I arrived, sitting in the queue waiting to board, the tyre pressure monitoring system indicated one of the rears was low. I checked it over and could see nothing wrong, so assumed the system hadn\u2019t been reset correctly when the tyres were changed. A few button presses later on the giant touchscreen and all was well.\nThis was the first time I\u2019d crossed the Channel on holiday using the overnight ferry, usually opting for the Chunnel, and I must say it was a revelation. If you make sure you book a comfy cabin, you can sleep the hours away and wake up refreshed and ready for the eight-hour drive across France on the other side.\nWhen we hit France, the T8 had used most of its 25 miles of electric range, and as I crossed the country I realised that when I got to the Alps and might need to call on the all-wheel drive, I\u2019d need some electric to help me along.\nNot wanting to stop to top up, and knowing the T8 can\u2019t accept fast charges anyway, I used the car\u2019s recharge-on-the-move function. At the press of a button, the engine charges the battery pack for you as you drive.\nThis takes around an hour of driving time, and once it\u2019s topped up you can elect to hold the charge for later. To do this you simply isolate the battery pack from the drivetrain, but you need to remember to do it every time you turn the engine off and on again, otherwise it defaults to using it.\nBy the time I got to the Alps, I didn\u2019t actually need the all-wheel-drive function as the roads had been nicely cleared by the efficient French snow teams, but it was good to know I wouldn\u2019t have been stuck all the same.\nAs we crossed France, the V90 really came into its own in the comfort stakes.

It is the most the bank has ever pumped into the financial system, topping the near 450 billion it injected with its first one-year loans back in 2009.\nIts hope is that the ultra-cheap and ultra-long funding will have a range of beneficial effects, including bolstering trust in banks, easing the threat of a credit crunch and tempting banks to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, thereby calming markets and easing the currency bloc&apos;s sovereign debt crisis.\n\"The take-up was massive ... much higher than the expected 300 billion euros.

As with other garden vegetables, though, pumpkins are susceptible to diseases. Plant your pumpkin patch in a place with well-drained soil and full sun, for optimum yield and to prevent disease. You can also plant varieties bred for their resistance to diseases.\nThis fungal disease reduces pumpkin yield, negatively affects flavor and eventually kills the plant. It lives in the soil and in plant debris left to rot in your pumpkin patch. This fungus first appears as white, grey or brown powdery spots on stems. In the second stage, it appears on the undersides of the leaves and then spreads to the entire plant. Left untreated, the leaves yellow, curl and whither, which causes the plant to die. Get rid of powdery mildew by clipping off and destroying infected parts, watering early in the day and applying sulfur or other natural fungicide. To prevent powdery mildew, plant resistant varieties such as \u201cChef\u2019s Choice F1\u201d for eating or \u201cTreasure F1\u201d for miniature decorative pumpkins.\nWet weather promotes anthracnose, another fungal disease. It\u2019s most vigorous when the temperature is between 78 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread by wind, rain and dirty garden tools, it over-winters in diseased plant debris. Anthracnose causes circular, dark brown spots on the leaves and fruit. The leaves wither and fall off, eventually killing the plant. To get rid of anthracnose, dispose of diseased plant debris, remove infected plants from your pumpkin patch and repeatedly apply a sulfur-based fungicide every seven to 10 days. To prevent this fungal disease, do not tend to your pumpkin patch when it\u2019s wet, clean your garden tools and rotate crops.\nThis soil pathogen lives in the soil and grows in warm, moist conditions. Crown rot causes the entire pumpkin plant to turn yellow. Within two to four weeks of infection, the plant wilts, collapses, decays and dies. Crown rot produces lesions covered with grey or white mold on pumpkins. You cannot get rid of crown rot with fungicides. To control it, remove and dispose of diseased plants. Prevent the spread of crown rot by cleaning your garden tools and by rotating crops.\nSclerotinia fungus causes sclerotinia rot and survives indefinitely in soil, which makes recurring outbreaks common. It appears during humid, cool weather and damages the pumpkin stems and fruit. It appears as a cotton-like, white mold in the area where the stem connects with the fruit.

{"idx": "31864", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Parents who have a child with Down syndrome and believe in reproductive freedom walk a difficult line. I know this because I\u2019m one of them. We\u2019re committed to protecting legalized abortion while also advocating for unbiased information that might lead fewer women to choose termination after receiving a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. I value women\u2019s rights, but I also value the children who fill our lives with joy and purpose. Even as our society has made great strides to include people with disabilities, prenatal genetic testing is becoming increasingly routine, and abortion is being used to drive a political wedge between disability advocates and advocates of women\u2019s reproductive rights.\nChris Kaposy confronts these dilemmas head on. Identifying as decidedly pro-choice, Kaposy offers a well-informed, thoughtful, and compassionate argument for why prospective parents might not just accept but welcome a child with Down syndrome into their families. Where much of the energy in Down syndrome advocacy has focused on why it is wrong to abort, Kaposy makes the refreshing case that it is a social good to bring people with Down syndrome into the world.\nIt is reasonable to ask why a book on the ethics of prenatal testing would focus exclusively on Down syndrome. Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disability, affecting one in every 700 live births in the United States. While often associated with older mothers, babies with Down syndrome are born to women of all ages, and evenly distributed across races and geographic locations. Because of its ubiquity, Down syndrome is on the front lines of debates over abortion and genetic tests that are an increasingly routine part of prenatal care.\nAt the same time, thanks to improved medical care and social inclusion, people with Down syndrome can expect to lead full and happy lives. This reality raises challenging questions about why we are so eager to detect the condition prenatally and how we act on that information. While Kaposy recognizes what is unique about Down syndrome, he also claims that many aspects of his argument might be applied to other disabilities, particularly those involving cognitive differences.\nKaposy writes from personal experience as the parent of a son with Down syndrome. While some might see his position as hopelessly compromised, Kaposy argues that parents have a privileged understanding of the difficulties and benefits of including a child with Down syndrome in the family. Instead of dismissing them, we should listen to what they have to say.\nKaposy devotes a chapter to exploring the evidence provided in parental memoirs (full disclosure: I am the author of one of them), which he corroborates in the next chapter with quality-of-life studies and other data collected by social scientists. All concur that the challenges of finding adequate health care, education, and behavioral support for a child with Down syndrome are almost always outweighed by the joys and rewards, and that a good deal of the suffering experienced by people with Down syndrome and their families comes from prejudice and exclusion rather than physical or cognitive differences.\nKaposy\u2019s critical generosity is striking in today\u2019s combative and polarized political atmosphere. His measured tone is an especially welcome corrective to the nasty and divisive voices that so often dominate debates over abortion. There is no scolding or condemnation here, but rather respectful disagreement with those, like philosophers Peter Singer, Richard Daw\u00adkins, Allen Buchanan, Dan W. Brock, Norman Daniels, and Daniel Wikler, who believe people with Down syndrome are less worthy of life, as well as those who consider abortion to be wrong under any circumstances.

But today they often shun the cooking process in favor of a \"one pot\" method in which a toxic stew is prepared in a 2-liter bottle and then shaken to create a reaction.\nThe latest \"meth labs\" can fit inside a shopping bag.\nThe one-pot phenomenon, also referred to as \"shake and bake,\" has caused a surge in traumatic burn injuries across the country, according to news accounts.\n\"It's easier for them to conceal, but it's also more hazardous,\" said Lt. Jeff Orr, supervisor of a crime task force for Ashtabula and Trumbull counties.\nThe March 4 fire at the Park Haven Home, a nursing facility with 33 residents a block from the downtown fire station, started in a second-floor room. Authorities said the volatile ingredients of a one-pot lab ignited, killing Ashtabula resident Shaun Warrens, 31.\nIn the room were Warrens and two others, including the man who lived there. One person fled before police arrived. Warrens had burns over the entire front of his body, and his clothing had been burned off. Several people were taken to the Ashtabula County Medical Center with injuries.\nPolice and fire officials have declined to release details about the lab operation or the fire, saying the case is still under investigation.\nThere are any number of ways the one-pot process can go up in flames. Solvents used in the method produce potentially explosive vapors.\nMobile labs typically consist of drain cleaner, camp-stove fuel, lithium, ammonium nitrate and a 2-liter soda bottle, said Fire Chief Ron Pristera. Manufacturers use small amounts of the key ingredient, pseudoephedrine, a decongestant found in cold medicines, and they produce small quantities of meth, generally for personal use.\nThe federal government says meth-lab seizures fell sharply after federal and state laws restricted the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine starting in 2005. But domestic production appears to be going back up, in part because of the proliferation of smaller, one-pot labs.\nAnother element that makes the mobile operations easy to keep under wraps is that they don't give off the noxious fumes associated with full-scale labs that cook meth.\nPolice Chief Robert Stell said police don't believe the Park Haven staff was aware of the meth production at the home. He said it's not clear whether meth had been made at the nursing home previously.\n\"That's still under investigation,\" Stell said. Ashtabula police have come across their first mobile labs in recent months, the chief said. State officials also have seen a"}

With the win today, Nevada is now 11-4 in its last 15 regular-season games against New Mexico and has won all five series during that span.\nZamora finished his weekend going six-for-nine with a home run, two RBI and ten total bases. Freshman pitcher Tyler Smith (1-1) earned his first-career victory after pitching 2.2 perfect innings in relief.\nThe Wolf Pack got on the board early, thanks to senior Keaton Smith\u2019s first triple of the season that drove in freshman Nick Seamons in the second inning. Junior Marco Valenzuela smacked an RBI-single to bring Smith home and give Nevada a 2-0 lead after two innings.\nA big third inning gave Nevada the lead that it would never relinquish, tallying three more runs that began with a Zamora solo shot over the left field wall. A balk scored freshman Julian Boyd from third and senior Weston Hatten scored on a Matt Clayton groundout to give the Pack a 5-0 lead after three innings of play.\nThe Lobos roared back in the fourth and fifth innings, plating two runs in each including a two-run bomb by Jared Mang to cut Nevada\u2019s lead to one. Smith then came on to pitch with one out in the fifth, and didn\u2019t allow another hit while on the bump with a 5-4 lead. Nevada responded in the bottom of the fifth as Hatten scored on a throwing error after stealing third to give the Pack a 6-4 lead.\nJunior Grant Ford came in and pitched the final two innings, including delivering a perfect six-pitch eighth inning.

A former member of the Black Panther Party, Bell was convicted for the 1971 murder of two New York City police officers, Waverly M. Jones and Joseph A. Piagentini. Bell was sentenced to 25 years to life; he has currently served nearly 45 years, after having previously been denied parole seven times.\n\u201cI think the parole board recognized that Herman Bell satisfied all the criteria for parole; which is whether it\u2019s probable that he would lead a crime-free life if released,\u201d said Robert Boyle, Bell\u2019s attorney.\nThe parole board\u2019s decision has set off fierce reactions. A statement from NYC Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association (PBA) president Patrick Lynch said that members were \u201cdisgusted, offended and extremely angry with this parole board\u2019s decision,\u201d using words like \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d to describe Bell. \u201cToday, it is accepted that, absent a constitutionally viable death penalty, the appropriate sentence for anyone who intentionally murders a NYC police officer is life without parole,\u201d Lynch wrote.\nThe patrol board\u2019s guidelines for granting parole includes institutional adjustment (which in itself includes program goals and accomplishments, academic and vocational achievements, therapy and interpersonal relationships), and availability of adequate release plans, including community resources.\nThe board also mentioned a Feb 20 letter from one of slain officer Jones\u2019 children, calling it \u201cnoteworthy.\u201d \u201c[Parole] would bring joy and peace as we have already forgiven Herman Bell publicly,\u201d the parole board quoted the letter as stating.\nHowever, Diane Piagentini, Joseph Piagentini\u2019s widow, does not support Bell\u2019s release. \u201cThe message being sent devalues the life of my brave husband who was taken from his two daughters and for whom there is no parole.\u201d she wrote in a statement that was released in association with the PBA statement, describing Bell as \u201canimalistic.\u201d And on March 20, the New York Daily News published an interview with Jones\u2019s siblings, who spoke against parole.\nBoyle took issue with what he described as the media re-characterizing the issue as a debate between victims\u2019 families. \u201cThat is also inflammatory and exploiting the grief felt by the families, for their own purposes,\u201d he said.\nBoyle also expressed concern for Bell\u2019s safety, especially as, according to a March 15 article in the New York Post, the PBA sent their members a safety alert in which they were urged to remain vigilant in the event of Bell\u2019s release. Boyle called the safety alert outrageous. \u201cThat\u2019s basically putting out a hit on Herman Bell,\u201d he said.\nThere has been wide community support for Bell\u2019s release. A recent CBS New York poll indicated that 86 percent of the 6,000 respondents agreed with the decision. Over 80 organizations signed a statement of support for the parole board\u2019s decision. A letter of support from hundreds of artists and cultural workers is expected to be released on March 23.

The point is to make sure that this extremely sensitive area is protected.\nThe problem is an example of the conflicts that can arise from overdevelopment. As land prices increase, developers push to build in marginal and less expensive areas, such as those that lack sufficient water. If that happens in the bubble area, wells there soon could be pumping salt water.\nThe bubble supplies most of the drinking water to northeast Seminole County farms and 3,000 people in the area. County restrictions require permits for any new wells there, and in October the county denied a permit for a well to supply a proposed 320-acre Geneva housing development.\nIn denying the permit, county commissioners said they wanted to work with the water management district to outline the water problems in the Geneva area and come up with a plan for dealing with it.\nIt's time to take that action. The county and the state must work to find ways to protect that water resource. The best way is to limit development in that part of the county.\nThe state must protect the \"bubble\" and the property owners who rely on its water."}

My husband was nearby and got up to look around for it, but he didn't find it. I jumped to the conclusion that he just didn't know where to look, so I got up and looked myself. I didn't find Perrito either.\n\"Sorry, we'll find Perrito in the morning,\" I told her. She was quiet.\nA few minutes later, my daughter whispered something. I got closer.\n\"Maybe he's on the shelf,\" she whispered again very quietly.\n\"Yeah, the 'down' shelf,\" she specified. I didn't know exactly where she meant, but it sure sounded like she knew!\n\"It sounds like you know where Perrito is,\" I said. \"Do you want to go take a look?\" She got up and came right back with Perrito, smiling.\nI got a good laugh out of this, but it also got me thinking. Not only did it not occur to either my husband or me to ask her where the stuffed animal was, but she also decided to watch us unsuccessfully work at this without telling us\u2014until she had no other choice but to give up on it, or use what she knew.\nHere's the thing. Not so long ago, it would have been pretty unrealistic for her to put a toy in a specific place and remember it later, unless there was something very significant about the incident surrounding that action. This didn't seem like it. But she is growing every day! And suddenly her memory was a big leap beyond where we thought she was\u2014our assumptions and habits needed updating!\nThis made me think about a classroom of growing students. Sometimes the leaps adolescents make are not as concrete as those in toddlers, but research tells us they are growing at just about the same rate\u2014and the leaps are probably as dramatic in terms of what's going on beneath the surface. With 25-plus students at once, the likelihood of at least one making a cognitive leap at any point that we aren't aware of is huge!\nWhat does this mean for teachers? I think it means that we need to integrate an awareness that at any moment, that many of our students probably know more than we realize. Our impressions and our data can become outdated in an instant, and when that happens, students might not let us know. Come to think of it, I've seen students \"play dumb\" while a teacher overly breaks down and scaffolds a task they know well how to do.\nThere's a strange power children and adolescents can derive from watching adults be clueless about something they know\u2014it's the role reversal that makes it a novel event.\nFrom a pedagogical standpoint, this reality encourages teaching choices that create space for and build on students' knowledge and abilities to make decisions in their learning, rather than present our own knowledge and prescribe processes for them. Certainly for efficiency it can be beneficial to limit the number of decisions students make in a particular learning activity, but we need to realize that when we do so, we open the door for students to hide what they know.\nFor my toddler at bedtime, that was cute, but in the classroom, I think it becomes a rabbit hole\u2014the longer the charade goes on, the less students feel their knowledge is actually wanted in the classroom. That perception and a resulting anger is often behind the choices of bright, underachieving students. It's frustrating to watch someone choose to underachieve\u2014but perhaps more importantly, they feel chronically under"}

It said it valued press freedom but it had to balance this against the public interest.\nAP revealed on Monday that the justice department, without informing the organisation in advance, had obtained two months' worth of phone records of calls made by reporters and editors.\nLawyers for AP said the records, which the justice department appears to have obtained from the phone companies earlier this year, listed every call made by about 100 reporters from AP's main offices in New York, Washington and Hartford, Connecticut, and from its office in the House of Representatives press gallery between April and May last year. The justice department informed AP last Friday. AP described it as a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" into newsgathering operations.\nThe attorney's office refused to say why the seizure had been made but it is almost certainly in relation to an AP exclusive report on 7 May last year in which it reported the CIA had stopped a plot by an al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen to destroy a US-bound airliner.\nAP at the time agreed to White House and CIA requests to hold back publication because they said an intelligence operation was still under way. After being satisfied that these concerns had been met, AP published on the Monday, ignoring a request from the Obama administration to wait until Tuesday for the official announcement.\nThe justice department has since launched an investigation into the leak. The phone records of five of the reporters plus an editor involved in the Yemen story were among those taken.\nAP's president and chief executive officer, Gary Pruitt, sent a letter of protest to the attorney-general, Eric Holder. \"These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,\" Pruitt said.\nHe described it as \"serious interference with AP's constitutional rights to gather and report the news\".\nAlthough Obama was elected on a liberal ticket in 2008 and again in 2012, his administration has mounted a sustained campaign through the courts and other means against whistleblowers, particularly in relation to what it claims are sensitive intelligence matters.\nMedia organisations and civil rights groups complain that many of the cases it appear to have to do with administrative secrecy than matters of national security.\nThe Obama administration has brought six cases against people suspected of leaking classified information, which AP described as being more than under all previous presidents combined.\nA former CIA officer found himself in trouble for revealing details to journalists about waterboarding while a former member of the National Security Agency was prosecuted for disclosing that the agency was about to spend millions of dollars on a software programme that he argued was more expensive than a similar programme developed in-house.\nThe justice department, in its statement, defended the AP seizure. \"Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws,\" it said.\nThe justice department said that it had, as required by law, made every reasonable effort to obtain the information through alternative means.

While it\u2019s certainly worthwhile when you drop your loose change into the Salvation Army kettles, there can be more tax beneficial ways to gift larger amounts.\nI recently had the opportunity to speak with Laura Scharr-Bykowsky, CFP\u00ae, MBA, the principal of Ascend Financial Planning, LLC about effective gifting strategies.\nMike Chamberlain: I know that most people will simply write a check to their charity of choice but for many, there is a more tax efficient way to gift, right?\nLaura Scharr-Bykowsky: It\u2019s true that a check is the easiest way, but if an investor wants to make a gift and help themself to a bigger tax break, there is a better option. If an investor has held an appreciated stock or mutual fund for more than one year, they can donate those securities to a charity and receive a tax deduction for the fair market value of the securities, and eliminate any capital gains assessments on the future sale of the securities. In some cases that could be as much as 23.8% in addition to a savings on State income tax.\nMC: Well that sounds good, but can you give us an example?\nLSB: Sure! Let\u2019s say Mr. Benevolent, who happens to be in the 25% Federal tax bracket (or 32% bracket when you factor in State income tax rates), wants to give $10,000 to his favorite charity and writes a check to it. That\u2019s a simple tax deduction of $10,000 less $3,200 (the Federal and State taxes he avoided) for a net cost to him of $6,800.\nBut what if Mr. Benevolent decided instead to contribute $10,000 in appreciated securities, say the mutual fund he bought a few years back for $2,000? He still gets a tax reduction of $3,200, but additionally, he no longer has to pay long-term capital gains taxes on the appreciated amount of the mutual funds, which in his case is $1,200 or equivalent to 15% of the $8,000 in what would be long-term gains (plus any State income tax). That means that a total of $4,400 taxes were avoided; the $3,200 initial deduction plus $1,200 in capital gains taxes, making the net cost of the gift $5,600, down from the $6,800 with a straight check donation (not including State income tax).\nMC: Well that sounds like a good deal, but what if Mr. Benevolent really liked that particular mutual fund or stock?\nLSB: If Mr. Benevolent then buys more of the the mutual fund or stock he gifted at the current market value, going forward, his adjusted cost basis is higher, meaning that his tax bill will be lower when he sells sometime in the future.\nMC: It seems pretty clear that that\u2019s a good deal, but is there ever a time when gifting appreciated securities isn\u2019t the best idea?\nLSB: There are a few reasons when it does not make sense.\nIf you don\u2019t itemize your deductions then this type of gift doesn\u2019t make much sense.\nIf you didn\u2019t own the securities for a minimum of 12 months because the tax deduction will be limited to the original purchase price or your cost basis.\nIf you"}

{"idx": "31901", "prompt": "Continue the following text: President Donald Trump is considering giving U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman more authority over the U.S. outpost that handles Palestinian affairs, five U.S. officials said, a shift that could further dampen Palestinian hopes for an independent state.\nAny move to downgrade the autonomy of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem \u2014 responsible for relations with the Palestinians \u2014 could have potent symbolic resonance, suggesting American recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem and the West Bank. And while the change might be technical and bureaucratic, it could have potentially significant policy implications.\nAs president, Trump has departed from traditional U.S. insistence on a \"two-state solution\" for the Mideast conflict by leaving open the possibility of just one state. As his administration prepares to unveil a long-awaited peace plan, the Palestinians have all but cut off contact, enraged by Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.\nThe deliberations come as Friedman, who has pushed for changes to the consulate since he arrived in Israel last year, faces growing indignation in the U.S. over partisan comments and other actions in which he has publicly sided with Israel over its critics. On Thursday, a top Democratic lawmaker even suggested Friedman should be recalled after he waded into domestic U.S. politics on Israel's behalf, telling an Israeli newspaper that Democrats have failed to support Israel as much as Republicans.\nFor decades, the Jerusalem consulate has operated differently than almost every other consulate around the world. Rather than reporting to the U.S. Embassy in Israel, it has reported directly to the State Department in Washington, giving the Palestinians an unfiltered channel to engage with the U.S. government.\nThat arrangement was relatively clear-cut before Trump moved the embassy. Until Trump's decision in December to move it from Tel Aviv, the United States did not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Jerusalem consulate provided services to Americans in Jerusalem and also served as the de facto U.S. embassy to the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem for the capital of a future independent state.\nBut since Trump earlier this month moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the situation has become more complicated. Now the U.S. maintains an embassy in one part of the city and a separate consulate less than a mile away, potentially creating confusion about who has ultimate authority if, for example, an American citizen needs help and turns to the U.S. government.\nNo final decision has been made about what changes to make to the consulate's chain of command, a decision complicated by the consulate's unique circumstances. But the embassy, run by Friedman, is expected to end up with ultimate authority over the consulate, officials said. They weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.\nDan Shapiro, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said such a move would be perceived as undermining Palestinians' claims to sovereignty and statehood aspirations, because it would suggest that Washington considers the Palestinian Authority to be under Israel's jurisdiction. Otherwise, Shapiro said, why would it expect the Palestinians to talk to the U.S. through its mission to Israel?\n\"They don't want to deal with the U.S. embassy to Israel as their channel,\" said Shapiro, now a scholar at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. \"They want their voice to be heard directly in Washington.\"\nTypically, the head of a consulate, known as a consul general, reports to the ambassador, who"}

The app is available on Apple iOS, Android devices, and Kindle Fire, and as of Friday, it came preloaded on the Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphone.\nThere are other apps for saving or reproducing kids\u2019 artwork, such as ArtKive, Plum Print, Canvsly, and Art My Kid Made.

He wanted to save the visuals as well as the context behind them. Keepy was founded in New York in 2013 but relocated last September to Palo Alto, CA, Gutelzon said.\nPosting pictures of kids\u2019 artwork on Facebook, of course, is one way of sharing such things with family, Gutelzon said, but he wanted a more private option. \u201cWhen you Facebook it, you get \u2018Likes\u2019 but the personal reaction never gets to the kids,\u201d he said.\nWith Keepy, grandparents and other relatives can leave video comments for the kids.\nPeople can use the free version of the app to record up to 15 memories per month, Gutelzon said. Unlimited access costs $30 for a year, or $5.99 per month, with pricing subject to change.\nGutelzon is looking for more ways to make kids\u2019 art memorable. He said Keepy has deals, including some in the works, with other companies to convert their creations into physical objects. \u201cWe have a partnership with Budsies that turns the artwork into plush animals,\u201d Gutelzon said. There are also plans pending for Keepy art to become 3D-printed objects produced by Kids Creation Station, based in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s many ways to turn those memories into real life,\u201d he said.\nKeepy previously raised more than $1.1 million in a seed round that included Winklevoss Capital and individual investors, and the company has more plans in the works. \u201cWe are in the process of raising more money,\u201d Gutelzon said."}

But the cheapness of video has allowed him simply to play the law of averages: a day spent on a basketball court trying thousands of baskets from hundreds of positions yields 10 amazing swish shots (a not unreasonable ratio) and a video that makes him look like the next Michael Jordan.\nThen there's the soda-can genre: people walking along the street throwing an endless supply of soda cans into receptacles from the unlikeliest of places\u2014over a bridge, down an escalator railing, behind a door that blocks their view.\nAgain, it's the law of averages, not skill. (Well, the law of averages and editing.) It might take off like parkour and bring an end to littering, but I doubt it.\nThe problem is that these are computer skills masquerading as real-world skills. People with genuinely amazing abilities are being drowned out by these frauds.\nAsking for self-disclosure won't make anyone more honest. I suggest we work up a disclaimer and start shining a light on this dishonest practice. How about \"edited for excellence\"?"}

{"idx": "31919", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Rob May is CEO and cofounder of Backupify.\nI believed the same lies that you still believe, for a long time. I was in college during the early days of the World Wide Web, and like others, I rejoiced in the incredible access to knowledge it provided, and diversity of thought it promoted. So when I first read in 2008 about how the Internet had a negative impact by narrowing modern scholarship, I didn\u2019t believe it. The Internet was great, and was making us more productive, more creative, and more innovative. That\u2019s what we were promised.\nA year later, when I started Backupify, I was granted a firsthand look at venture capital and startups, an area of the economy that supposedly drives innovation, and is full of mavericks, eccentrics, visionaries, iconoclasts, and other innovative types. Yet I didn\u2019t find most of the people I met to be all that innovative. Every person I met seemed to read the same tech blogs, have the same information, share the same opinions about the same topics, and have the same business ideas.\nIf the Internet had narrowed scholarship, could it have narrowed innovation as well?\nI have come to believe that, yes, the Internet is killing innovation. A broad and thorough discussion about why is beyond the scope of this piece, but let me whet your appetite and plant some seeds of doubt in your biased pro-Internet love fest.\nNarrow views. The Internet rewards blockbusters, which drives out diversity. I hate the online versions of most periodicals because all of the focus is on the most popular, most emailed, and most commented on stories. As a result, when readers go to a site and have limited time, they read the things everyone else reads. This behavior promotes media economics that push writers to go for these blockbuster pieces, which occasionally are great pieces of work but more often than not are linkbait that panders to our interest in gossip.\nI still subscribe to paper versions of the Wall Street Journal, and a dozen other periodicals, because print is the best and fastest way to skim through and find some of the important, but non-blockbuster articles. When you read what everyone else reads, in the same ways that they read it, you will have the same ideas. Serendipity can be a source of innovation, but not in a world where we all consume the same information.\nI agree with Nate Silver, who wrote in his book \u201cThe Signal and The Noise\u201d that a certain amount of immersion in a topic will provide disproportionately more insight than an executive summary. Innovation requires insight, which requires a deep understanding of certain topics. The Internet encourages shallow executive summary versions of everything.\nLimited experience. Your brain is more deterministic than you think. Neuroscientists have a saying: \u201cfire together, wire together.\u201d It describes how neurons build connections. Add that to the points above and you realize that if most startup people read the same stuff, and that stuff is ever more concentrated on shallow executive summaries about less diverse topics, everyone\u2019s brains are wiring up to think the same way about the same things. There aren\u2019t deep insights because our experiences are less diverse than they have ever been.\nThe Internet has taken startup culture, which used to be a collection of eccentric misfits, and homogenized it. And homogenization is anathema to innovation. If you really want to innovate, do something different, something daring, and something unconventional. Be a real iconoclast, and unplug. The Internet is for lemmings, and you have bigger and better things to do.\n"}

{"idx": "31926", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Until recently, a disorder in men similar to menopause was not recognized. But the truth is, men begin to lose their main male hormone \u2014 testosterone \u2014 beginning about age 50. By age 60, about 60 percent of men have low testosterone levels. The levels of free circulating testosterone are highly variable, with some men in their 70s having levels as high as a 20-year-old and some with barely detectable levels.\nThe reason most men do not experience the dramatic symptoms many women experience with menopause is that their hormonal decline is often slower, allowing the body and brain to adjust. Yet, some men will have dramatic changes. Unfortunately, most doctors still do not recognize andropause in men and just assume their male patients are getting old. My report \"Stop Aging Naturally\" will give more in-depth ways to slow the relentless march of time.\nReplacing testosterone can increase muscle mass, reduce fat levels, improve mood and mental energy, prevent bone loss, and improve brain function \u2014 but only if given in doses that bring the levels up to those seen in 30-year-olds. High doses can be harmful and even increase brain degeneration.\nConnected to testosterone loss is an age-related decrease in another hormone called DHEA. Levels at age 30 are five times higher than at age 85, with the fall beginning progressively in the late 40s. Studies seem to indicate that supplementing with DHEA-S (the functional form of DHEA) prevents obesity, reduces one\u2019s risk of diabetes (improves insulin resistance), lowers the risk of certain types of cancer, reduces heart attack and stroke risk, and improves immune function.\nDHEA also improves mood and motivation and gives a sense of well-being.

There\u2019s no way of knowing where the insects have been and what they\u2019ve consumed.\nUnger\u2019s design allows consumers to use their own vegetable scraps to grow up to 500 grams of mealworms each week. It relies on a system of sensors and heat to regulate the insects\u2019 growth.\nWith another 49 days to go, Livin Farms is already well over halfway to reaching their goal of $100,000 in funding through a Kickstarter campaign.

Experience can only show, but one fears that the imagination would not be stimulated but impeded by a situation in which all the action is there but all the costumes are in conflict with it.\nIt is one thing to envisage Macbeth or Lady Macbeth from the sound of the human voice; it is another and a very different one for the ear to have to argue with the eye against the spectacle of Macbeth moving about the stage in the khaki uniform of a company commander and his wife in a modern dinner frock. Those who are in favour of such assaults would justify themselves rather as those who are in favour of modernised versions of the Bible. The older version, they would say, has lost its savour by incessant usage; the modern world is more easily stampeded into attention by a fresher presentation of the old story. Well, a shock is always a shock \u2013 but a shock is not necessarily Shakespeare.\nIt may be granted that the dramatic values of the words and action must still emerge, but why hamper them by an association with costumes every implication of which is several centuries in advance of anything that could be realised by the writer of the play. It is, perhaps, one way of persuading some people to see Shakespeare at all, but fundamentally the interest of these shock tactics seems an embarrassment to the proper values of the play.\nRead the Guardian review of Sir Barry Jackson\u2019s production of Macbeth in modern dress.\nManchester Guardian, 6 February 1928."}

The literature is ripe with alternative labels, including, but not limited to, abstract particular (Campbell 1990), moment (Mulligan et al. 1984), mode (Heil 2003), qualiton (Bacon 2011), quality instance (Segelberg 1999 [1945,1947,1953]), concrete property (K\u00fcng 1967), particular property (Denkel 1996), and unit property (Mertz 1996).\n2.

This list of early proponents of trope-like entities could have been made much longer. Mertz (1996) mentions, besides those already listed, Bo\u00ebthius, Avicenna, and Averro\u00ebs. Mulligan et al. point to Spinoza, Descartes, Berkeley and Hume.\n4. Mulligan et al.

The government originally reported that the economy grew at a 1.9% annualized rate in the first quarter.\nThe growth in the second quarter was also below the 1.8% increase expected by economists surveyed by CNNMoney.\nDubbed a \"soft patch\" by economists and even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the economy's sluggishness was due to a variety of factors that weighed on consumers and businesses.\nHigher gas prices for one, hit Americans hard when they peaked at a national average of $3.98 a gallon in May.\nOverall, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of gross domestic product, picked up only 0.1% in the second quarter -- marking a significant slowdown from growth of 2.1% in the first three months of the year.\n\"The major disappointment in the report was the weakness in consumer spending, and it wasn't just fewer automobiles being sold due to Japan's earthquake. There was broad-based softness in consumer spending.\" Guatieri said.\nIt marked the slowest growth in consumer spending since the fourth quarter of 2009.\nLooking back further, it also now appears that American consumers had less disposable income than originally thought from 2007 through 2010, whereas corporate profits were revised significantly higher for 2009 and 2010.\nThe government revised the GDP data back to 2003 and also found the recession was worse than originally thought.\nOverall, the theme of the U.S. recovery continues to be one driven by companies holding cash on the sidelines and building up their infrastructure, rather than a recovery driven by consumers.\nAmericans on Main Street continue to be held back by slow job growth and the housing slump, even as major companies report strong profits and have mostly solid balance sheets.\nAccording to the latest GDP report, investment in commercial real estate surged 8.1% in the second quarter, and business spending on equipment and software rose 5.7%.\nMeanwhile, exports rose 6%. The U.S. continues to import far more goods and services than it exports to foreign countries, but because imports grew at a slower rate of 1.3%, that also contributed positively to GDP.\nThe aftermath of Japan's earthquake and tsunami may have been one of the major reasons import growth slowed, as the U.S. bought fewer auto parts from the country.\nFriday's GDP report also sparked cries from economists for lawmakers to act quickly in raising the debt"}

McMaster (shown), a Bilderberg attendee and a member of the globalist swamp known as the Council on Foreign Relations, is firing key Trump loyalists within the administration who seek to protect the president and implement his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, according to multiple sources and reports. One of the pro-Trump victims of the national security adviser\u2019s purge was reportedly fired just for highlighting in a report the unholy alliance against the president by Islamists and globalists.\nBy contrast, McMaster is said to be protecting and elevating radical Obama appointees dedicated to globalism, neoconservativism, and the infamous \u201cswamp\u201d that Trump promised to drain. Indeed, McMaster sent a letter to Susan Rice, Obama's extreme national security adviser, waiving legal requirements and promising her continued access to classified information \u2014 a month after the start of a congressional investigation into her involvement in lawlessly unmasking the identities of Americans whose communications were intercepted.\nMuch of McMaster's scheming has been happening without Trump's knowledge, inside sources and reports said. But now, with scandal swirling around the national security adviser, Trump is reportedly thinking of replacing McMaster and sending him off to Afghanistan. And among Trump's supporters, a movement of sorts aimed at getting McMaster and other establishment globalists fired is gathering steam, with multiple hashtags calling for McMaster's ouster spreading across social media.\nPerhaps the most stunning revelation on McMaster's purge of pro-Trump officials in recent days involves the firing of a top National Security Council official, NSC Director for Strategic Planning Rich Higgins, for outlining the powerful forces working to subvert Trump and their strategy. In a memo explaining the full-blown assault being waged against the Trump administration and the agenda the president successfully articulated to voters, Higgins offered accurate insight into what was and still is happening.\nThe official argued that the \u201cMaoist insurgency model\u201d was being used by subversive forces, both in and out of government, to crush Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda that Americans voted for in massive numbers. Among other elements is the debunked conspiracy theory alleging that Trump was essentially put into office by the Kremlin, according to Higgins, who was reportedly an ally of anti-globalist White House strategist Steve Bannon and other anti-establishment forces in the administration.\nFor putting those truths down on paper, Higgins was fired by McMaster, apparently without Trump's knowledge. But he was not the only one. Another recent victim of the globalist-led purge was Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the NSC's senior director for intelligence hired by non-globalist National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who himself appears to have been strategically taken down by the establishment and swamp creatures early on in Trump's term. Senior Middle East director Derek Harvey, another Flynn appointee, was ousted about a week ago, too. Yet another, Adam Lovinger, had his security clearance pulled by McMaster for attending a bar mitzvah in Israel, according to well-connected journalist Mike Cernovich. That forced him to leave his post.\nAnd the purges of patriots are not over yet. Indeed, according to multiple sources quoted by the Washington Free Beacon, McMaster was on the \u201cwarpath\u201d after learning of the memo outlining the subversive forces trying to quash Trump. As part of his globalist efforts to undermine the America First agenda, the national security adviser has been furiously"}

And while you may think growing your hair out is just a matter of letting nature take its course, to save yourself from wanting to put a paper bag over your head in the interim you're going to have to go into the process with a game-plan.\nRobinson is pretty adamant that long hair can work on all face shape and sizes, apart from round faces.

{"idx": "31953", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: I recently spoke at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo, where we covered a number of interesting topics. Following that event, you may have recently read headlines where the media has quoted me as predicting a second financial crisis. In this post, I'd like to give a little more context to that comment and also cover something I am particularly worried about: the problem of derivatives.\nMarket volatility is a reality of today and goes in two directions, up and down. One of the reasons we have (and are likely to continue to see) this level of volatility is because of the occasional misuse of derivatives. Of course, not all derivatives are bad. If understood and used appropriately they can be used by funds as tools to hedge or mitigate risk. For example, currency forwards or interest rate swaps are typically used to hedge out a fund's risk related to a specific currency or interest rate exposure.\nWhat I am most concerned about is the use of derivatives as speculative tools or derivatives that involve high levels of leverage where the investor did not adequately control the implied leverage and resulting market exposures and liabilities, such as companies that may use derivatives to \"game\" commodity exposures\u2014a practice that generally makes it more difficult to accurately assess the value of a company's stock. For example, an airline may start out using oil futures contracts to hedge the risk of a rise in the price of jet fuel, but may drift from this understandable hedging use into speculating on the price of oil\u2014a potentially risky activity that is somewhat removed from its core business of air transport. Misusing these financial instruments contributed significantly to the global financial crisis in 2008, and they continue to be used today. The total value of derivatives in the world at the end of 2010 was more than $600 trillion. That's 10 times the world's total GDP.\nWhen we have many derivative instruments betting in different directions with a lack of understanding and regulation, we are likely to have more volatility. Add to that the unforeseen and unpredictable events that occur across the world, together with an even more interconnected global marketplace, and we are likely to have more sharp and sudden moves in the market as knee-jerk reactions become more common among many investors. Such heightened volatility can scare people away from equity investments, which is a pity, since study after study has shown that in the long term, equities have outperformed.\nWe cannot exactly predict when the next market correction will hit us, nor know how great or small it will be, but we do realize that market volatility is here to stay. Few of the problems that caused the 2008 financial crisis have been resolved\u2014banks are bigger than ever, and the derivatives market continues to grow and remains largely unregulated. It is heartening to see that international policymakers are trying to work toward a global regulatory standard, but until we find a true, long-term solution to these problems, we cannot ignore the possibility of another financial crisis.\nBut, as a long-standing English proverb tells us, we can \"hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\" With every crisis comes great opportunity. Therefore, we continue to invest with a long-term horizon in companies that we believe are undervalued, fundamentally strong and growing, and those that we think can weather through difficult times. Our long-term, ground-up, disciplined investing approach has kept us in good stead through the volatility so far and, I believe, could see us through potential crises or corrections that may loom around the corner.\n.

He was 29.\nThis weekend, even if only for a minute, let\u2019s try to remember a man most of us never heard of.\nThis weekend, let\u2019s think of Jack Lummus. A star athlete at Baylor, Lummus might have made a living \u2014 and a name to remember \u2014 as an offensive end for the New York Giants. He played nine games for the Giants in 1941, his rookie year. But then, World War II.\nLummus enlisted in the Marines. As an athlete, a college man and an older man \u2014 he was 25 \u2014 he soon became 1st Lt. Lummus.\nOn Feb. 19, 1945, he was among the first wave to hit the black volcanic sand of Iwo Jima. For days, that first wave of men dug in, fought, advanced, dug in, advanced, dug in again \u2014 and died. Although it\u2019s reasonable to believe that on that day when the American flag was raised on Mt. Suribachi \u2014 Feb. 23 \u2014 the battle for Iwo Jima had ended, it had barely begun.\nOn March 8, Lummus, commanding a rifle platoon, had already been wounded in a shoulder and twice been knocked flat by grenade concussions when he rose to lead three successful assaults on entrenched positions. Pressing a fourth assault, a land mine blew off his legs; He was mortally wounded. Yet he continued to command his men.\nAnd Iwo Jima was still 18 days from won.\nIwo Jima produced 27 Medal of Honor recipients, 14 posthumously. Lummus\u2019 mother accepted her son\u2019s Medal of Honor on May 30, 1946 \u2014 64 years ago this Sunday.\nJack Lummus is buried near his boyhood home in Ennis, Texas.

Britain is more globally oriented as an economy and the dramatic decline in exports globally and trade generally following the collapse of Lehman Brothers had dramatic effects in the financial system of Britain,\" Mr Greenspan said.\n\"It's going to take a long while for you [Britain] to work your way through this.\"\nIn order to prevent the situation arising again, financiers and governments should look to clamp down on fraud and increase capital requirements for banks, the former central banker said.\nRegulations targeting the latter would mean banks would be forced to hold enough money to cover their normal operations and honour withdrawals.\nHowever despite his belief in a brighter future, the former Fed chief did warn that the path to recovery should steer clear of protectionism as applying strict regulations could hamper recent developments that have opened up global trade.\n\"The most recent endeavour to re-regulate is a reaction to the crisis. The extraordinary impact of these global markets is making a lot of financial people feeling they have lost control.\n\"The problem is you cannot have free global trade with highly restrictive, regulated domestic markets.\"\nDuring the interview for BBC Two's The Love of Money series, the former Fed chief said the current economic crisis was a \"once in a century type of event\", and one that he did not expect to witness.\nBlamed by some for not doing more to prevent the crisis, Mr Greenspan denied any responsibility for the problems gripping the global economy.\n\"It's human nature, unless somebody can find a way to change human nature, we will have more crises and none of them will look like this because no two crises have anything in common,"}

But hunger and access to adequate diets, too, are human rights issues \u2013 and here much remains to be done,\u201d the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, said in a news release at the end of an official visit to the country.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in Canada is a system that presents barriers for the poor to access nutritious diets and that tolerates increased inequalities between rich and poor, and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples,\u201d he added.\nWorking in an unpaid capacity, independent experts, or special rapporteurs, are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a country situation or a specific human rights theme.\nMr. De Schutter called on the Canadian Government to convene a national food conference that would clarify the allocation of responsibilities between the federal level, the provinces and territories in order to deliver adequate and affordable diets for all.\nHe noted three main concerns that need to be addressed in a national food strategy. The first is that a large number of Canadians are too poor to afford adequate diets.\n\u201cThis is a country that is rich, but that fails to adapt the levels of social assistance benefits and its minimum wage to the rising costs of basic necessities, including food and housing,\u201d he said, noting that 800,000 households are food insecure in Canada.\nThe second concern is that more than one in four Canadian adults is obese, and almost two thirds of the population is overweight or obese, costing at least $5 billion Canadian annually in health care costs and in lost productivity.\nThirdly, regarding the situation of Aboriginal peoples, Mr. De Schutter called for a reform of the Nutrition North Canada programme that subsidizes retailers to serve remote communities, as well as a structural approach to tackling the socio-economic and cultural barriers to opportunities for those living on reserves that result in their not enjoying fully their right to adequate food.\nThe Special Rapporteur will present his final report to a forthcoming session of the Human Rights Council in 2013.\nGlobalized food systems and the spread of Western lifestyles has spawned an international public health disaster with over a billion people suffering from undernourishment while another billion remain overweight or obese, an independent United Nations expert warned today."}

He was 86.\nDubbed Swifty after he accepted a dare and made five movie deals in one day for his friend Humphrey Bogart, Lazar had since the 1940s commanded record-setting fees for hundreds of writers, producers, directors, choreographers, composers and lyricists around the world.\nFor more than three decades, Lazar's famed Oscar night party--held most recently at Wolfgang Puck's Spago restaurant--had made him a celebrity host as well.\nDistinguished by his shiny, bald head and black-rimmed Mr. Magoo glasses, the 5-foot, 2-inch Lazar had a giant reputation as a tough, sometimes brazen negotiator. He liked to say he could assemble the essential elements of a movie from his clientele--all except the actors, whose constant need for reassurance, he said, usually made them too time-consuming to have as clients.\n\"Packaging is what I do a lot of. Except for the actors,\" he told Joseph Heller in 1963, just before he sold the motion picture rights to Heller's novel \"Catch-22.\" \"I'm what you might call a catalytic agent.\"\nIndeed, Lazar's career traced the arc of ascendancy of the agent in America.\n\"The town will be much poorer without him,\" said dancer Gene Kelly, a Lazar friend for 50 years. \"A lot of towns, including London, New York and Paris.\"\nServing as a liaison between disparate talents and the studios or publishers who sought their help, Lazar was among the first agents to shape entire productions--a job he found satisfying as well as lucrative. When he sold \"The Seven Year Itch,\" he collected commissions from George Axelrod, the author; Charles Feldman, the producer, and Billy Wilder, the director.\n\"He made more out of 'Itch' than anybody else,\" Axelrod told the Saturday Evening Post.\nBut Lazar's knack for assembling the creative forces of Hollywood was perhaps best illustrated each Oscar night, when he and his wife, Mary, who died in January, hosted their exclusive, glitzy party.\nThe black-tie dinner, which lured hundreds of stars and star-seekers from the Motion Picture Academy's official proceedings, was a magnet for legends and ingenues alike. The party kept the spotlight focused on Lazar long after some of his earliest big name clients, such as Truman Capote, Ira Gershwin, Vladimir Nabokov and Cole Porter, had died.\nIt was an elaborate production. To ensure that no one had to sit near an ex-husband or ex-scriptwriter, guests nibbled duck sausage pizza and toasted dill brioche in two rooms. To keep from elevating one room or the other to instant A-list status, Lazar had no assigned seat, preferring to roam back and forth between such personalities as Michael Jackson and"}
{"idx": "31963", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Volkswagen brought a pair of electric compacts to the floor of the 2013 Frankfurt auto show. The first is the E-Up, an electrified version of its Euro-market subcompact. The other is the E-Golf. Let's start with the smaller EV.\nThe E-Up's electric motor produces 60kW (about 80 horsepower) and generates its maximum torque of 155 pound-feet instantly from 0 rpm. The front-wheel-drive four-seater reaches 62 mph in about 12.4 seconds and has a top speed of about 80 mph.\nSo it's no eco-racer, but the E-Up does boast reasonable efficiency. From a single battery charge, the EV's 18.7kWh lithium ion battery will take the driver up to 99 miles.\nThe E-Up features three \"intuitive\" driving modes (Normal, Eco, and Eco+) and four levels of regenerative braking (D1, D2, D3, and B) that VW claims will help drivers to get the maximum range out of each charge. By comparison, the Fiat 500e has just one mode: Drive. I think that is even simpler and more intuitive.\nDrivers will be able to connect to their car via the Web through Volkswagen's Car-Net E-Remote service and app. From a smartphone, they'll be able to check the battery and charging state, monitor the climate control system, and push routes to the navigation system.\nThe E-Up's 18.7kWh lithiumion battery is located in the vehicle's floor; its 17 modules each contain 12 cells and weigh in at a total of 507 pounds. That's a lot of weight, but by keeping it low to the ground, the E-Up should retain reasonably good handling.\nVolkswagen states that driving 100km in the E-Up will cost the driver about 3.02 euros. Converting kilometers to miles and euros to dollars, that works out to about 6 cents per mile at current German power rates.\nThe new Volkswagen E-Golf has quite a lot in common with the rest of the Golf models that use its modular MQB platform, but its power train is very similar to the E-Up's.\nUnder the E-Golf's hood, you'll find a larger 85kW electric motor that outputs 199 pound-feet of torque and hits 62 mph in 10.4 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 87 mph. The E-Golf's lithium ion battery pack has also been upsized to 24.2kWh.\nLike the E-Up, the E-Golf features three driving modes and three regen levels to choose from. Thanks to its bigger battery, drivers can expect 118 miles of roving on a full charge.\nBoth the E-Golf and the E-Up are equipped as premium models, with automatic climate control, remote controlled parking heating/ventilation, navigation, heated windscreen, alloy wheels, and LED daytime running lights. The upmarket e-Golf further differentiates itself from its smaller sibling with all-LED headlights.\nVW will offer two charger options for the E-Golf: plugging the 2.3kW charger directly into Germany's 230-"}

I continue to believe Yahoo's stock is a much better bet than Google's (GOOG).\n2. I'm also hoping that the display-ad environment will continue to perk up because that could draw a lot of attention to it as well.\n3. In sum, it was a good quarter. Not stellar, but good.

Here are six takeaways.\nIn fall 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was publicly declaring it a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d that his company had played a role in deciding the election. But security experts at the company already knew otherwise.\nThey found signs as early as spring 2016 that Russian hackers were poking around the Facebook accounts of people linked to American presidential campaigns. Months later, they saw Russian-controlled accounts sharing information from hacked Democratic emails with reporters. Facebook accumulated evidence of Russian activity for over a year before executives opted to share what they knew with the public \u2014 and even their own board of directors.\nIn 2015, when the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump called for a ban of Muslim immigrants, Facebook employees and outside critics called on the company to punish Mr. Trump. Mr. Zuckerberg considered it \u2014 asking subordinates whether Mr. Trump had violated the company\u2019s rules and whether his account should be suspended or the post removed.\nBut while Mr. Zuckerberg was personally offended, he deferred to subordinates who warned that penalizing Mr. Trump would set off a damaging backlash among Republicans.\nMr. Trump\u2019s post remained up.\nRead The Times\u2019s investigation here.\nAs criticism grew over Facebook\u2019s belated admissions of Russian influence, the company launched a lobbying campaign \u2014 overseen by Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 to combat critics and shift anger toward rival tech firms.\nFacebook hired Senator Mark Warner\u2019s former chief of staff to lobby him; Ms. Sandberg personally called Senator Amy Klobuchar to complain about her criticism. The company also deployed a public relations firm to push negative stories about its political critics and cast blame on companies like Google.\nThose efforts included depicting the billionaire liberal donor George Soros as the force behind a broad anti-Facebook movement, and publishing stories praising Facebook and criticizing Google and Apple on a conservative news site.\nFacebook faced worldwide outrage in March after The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian published a joint investigation into how user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. But inside Facebook, executives thought they could contain the damage. The company installed a new chief of American lobbying to help quell the bipartisan anger in Congress, and it quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.\nSensing Facebook\u2019s vulnerability, some rival tech firms in Silicon Valley sought to use the outcry to promote their own brands. After Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped in an interview that his company did not traffic in personal data, Mr. Zuckerberg ordered his management team to use only Android phones. After all, he reasoned, the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.\nWashington\u2019s senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress during the 2016 election cycle \u2014 and he was there when the company needed him.\nThis past summer, as Facebook\u2019s troubles mounted, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, who"}

Municipalities convention in Whistler.\nThe report singled out land use oriented around cars as the top problem facing planners. Also cited was a road network that reduces choice and increases congestion, transit that isn\u2019t competitive with the car for many trips, road demand exceeding capacity at times and at pinch points, and the absence of managing road use.\nThe report notes that a five-minute, seven-kilometre trip on the Upper Levels from Lonsdale to south of the bridge can take 15 minutes and often much longer during rush hours.\n\u201cIncidents on the bridges and highway further increase delays,\u201d the report says.\nIn its analysis of transportation options, the report determined that widening existing bridges over Burrard Inlet wasn\u2019t an option due to \u201cstructural limitations.\nSome transportation improvements taking place include TransLink\u2019s new Marine-Main B-Line bus that could save riders up to 30 minutes when travelling from Park Royal to Phibbs Exchange when it opens in 2019.\nNext year will also see an improvement in SeaBus service when frequency is increased to every 10 minutes during rush hours. The change is expected to reduce average wait times by about one-third and increase passenger capacity by 1,500 per hour.\nMathew Bond, serving his first term as councilor in the District of North Vancouver, said the report shows an \u201cimpressive level of coordination\u201d among the various governments and organizations involved in transportation, such as municipalities, First Nations, the provincial and federal governments along with the Port Authority and TransLink.\nOne of the report\u2019s findings, he said, is a link between the slow rate in housing growth and congestion.\nThe province has already looked into widening the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and the Lions Gate Bridge. Structural limitations mean the bridges cannot be expanded.\nInitially, congestion would be relieved, but would return in few years as more people used their cars. The road network connecting to the bridge would have to be expanded, which would reduce livability in nearby neighbourhoods.\nThe bridge can\u2019t be used for buses or bikes because part of it raises and lowers for ships. Most often, it is in a raised position to accommodate marine traffic.\nA single lane dedicated to buses would increase congestion rather than relieve it. Delays, the report says, are mostly due to bottlenecks at bridgeheads rather than on the bridge decks.\nThe costs would be high, the report found, and would not create considerable time savings compared to using buses. It would also mean another transfer for commuters."}

Today, they are also responsible for a township of 700,000 people, making them responsible for a total of 800,000. It's just beyond belief,\" he added.\n\"I understand the history of South Africa and I understand the great changes they are going through, but among the police officers I noticed no significant problems, no problems that seemed different than other officers around the world have to deal with,\" he added.\nThe officers in \"South Africa are dedicated to bringing about a democratic society even with the struggles they face,\" he said.\nRuffolo is not a stranger to taking his DuPage police experiences and sharing them. The Office of International Criminal Justice is aware of his teaching experience and has sent him over the past five years to police schools to Germany, Holland and England.\n\"Even though my job is to teach others about our policing methods and crime prevention and violence in society, I walk away from these trips learning as much as I have given,\" said Ruffolo, who is currently working on his doctoral degree in education.\nRuffolo, who grew up on Chicago's South Side, taught school before he was a police officer, and his current teaching jobs include courses at the Chicago Police Academy.\n\"The world is becoming such a place that whether you are in Chicago, Woodridge, Naperville, South Africa or Germany, the police officer today needs that input and cooperation from the community, especially the parents of kids that get involved with the police,\" he said.\n\"No one, in South Africa or in DuPage County, has enough money to hire all the police officers necessary to stop crime, and prevention is taking the spotlight,\" he said. \"Tax dollars are tough things to come by no matter where you are.\"\nHard lessons: After three days of lengthy jury debate over the quality of air in the DuPage County Courthouse and the health problems of several hundred employees, the jurors told the judge that they had reached a verdict.\nHowever, they asked for a half-hour delay.\nThe reason: Having cleared the air in the jury room, they needed a cigarette break."}

But figuring out how long food actually lasts can be confusing: Labels use various phrasings to describe shelf life, like \u201csell by,\u201d \u201cuse by,\u201d and \u201cbest by.\u201d Others seem to have only a date, with no explanation what it means.\nThere is no uniform or universally accepted system used for food dating in the United States. Although dating of some foods is required by more than 20 states, there are areas of the country where much of the food supply has some type of open date and other areas where almost no food is dated.\nIn the video below, Money Talks News reporter Jim Robinson deciphers the food code with food safety expert Manny Delgado. Check it out, and then read on for more about the expiration of different foods.\nThese dates aren\u2019t that helpful for predicting the expiration of food you already have at home \u2013 a week or two past may be fine, but it\u2019s not exact. \u201cSell-by\u201d reflects store policy, not USDA rules. It\u2019s telling shelf stockers when food needs to be moved from its regular place to the store\u2019s clearance area. Especially if you plan to cook or freeze the food immediately, sell-by dates can lead to great buys.\nThese dates are basically quality guarantees by the manufacturer: The proper flavor and quality should last until at least this date when properly stored. Often these products are fine to eat past the listed date \u2013 but they might not taste great. The USDA says, \u201c\u2019Use-by\u2019 dates usually refer to best quality and are not safety dates. But even if the date expires during home storage, a product should be safe, wholesome and of good quality if handled properly and kept at 40 \u00b0F or below.\u201d Save money by not throwing out food that\u2019s still safe if not quite as savory.\nWhile the federal government doesn\u2019t require these, some states do on certain products \u2013 especially dairy, and often meat. This is one area where you don\u2019t want to cut corners. If the label explicitly mentions expiration, listen to it \u2013 with one exception from EggSafety.org: \u201cCartons may carry an expiration date (EXP) beyond which the eggs should not be sold, but are still safe to eat.\u201d The USDA says you have 3 to 5 weeks from purchase.\nFor more info on food handling and preparation, safety, and labeling, visit the USDA.

Sometimes people shake their heads or laugh as I get up.\nAlison has struggled with anxiety and depression since her teens, and says that loneliness and isolation plays a big role. That\u2019s why the photos have to show her alone but surrounded with people; to capture just how alone you feel when you\u2019re depressed and everyone else seems fine.\nShe saw the experience as a challenge to herself to be more open. What could be more open and honest than physically playing out how miserable you are in a public space?\nTaking the photos was healing, in a way.\nAlison says: \u2018I feel a commitment to this series, and that commitment is holding me accountable, compelling me to think creatively, and forcing me to get out and make pictures.\n\u2018In turn, the small accomplishment of even one photo makes me feel that despite everything, I am still capable of engaging in something I care about.\n\u2018I am grateful for that touchstone when all other functionality feels lost, as it sometimes does.\n\u2018Working on Devastation Portraits has required that I interact with the world, which is challenging for me when I\u2019m not feeling my best.\nThe photographer hopes that people won\u2019t look at the Devastation Portraits and think she\u2019s trying to represent all suffering \u2013 as that\u2019s simply not the case.\nInstead she wants the pictures to resonate with however overwhelmed, tired, or sad a person is feeling, and to let her body on the ground for people to project their own experience."}

{"idx": "31994", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I imagine that all Chief Bill Blair wants for Christmas is Don Cherry as the new chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, notwithstanding the chief\u2019s seemingly cozy relationship with the current chair. There was no Cherry-picking for Mayor Rob Ford when His Worship chose three council members, but he still has a civilian pick left if he wants to appoint his new best friend to the board. The chief can only hope. It\u2019s not likely that the province, with a few spots to fill coming up, will appoint someone on Blair\u2019s short list.\nBut it\u2019s not actually the chief I worry about. He has done some good things. Tons of experience. But it seems like too many military and paramilitary types just don\u2019t do well taking orders, let alone guidance, from anyone not wearing a uniform. Retired Gen. Rick Hillier, for example, loved giving himself directions in public, damn the minister of defence.\nSo what\u2019s up with the Toronto Police Services Board? It would be nice if it was arms-length effective in its oversight, but let\u2019s review the \u201cshort-arm\u201d impression of the recent post-G20 period. Three things stick out for me.\nHis first instinct was to unconditionally protect the police. No nuances, in sight, not even a \u201cwe\u2019ll obviously take a closer look to see what we can learn\u201d add-on after the appropriate public praise of our finest.\nHow does he get away with doing a public dance on this before he makes a presentation to his board? It reveals a total lack of respect for governance. More important, it was likely a public act of lobbying the incoming mayor because the chief knew the next meeting of the board would take place after the \u201ctougher\u201d Ford had made his assignments to the board.\nAnd later, after the chief had dug the hole of his own making even deeper, Mukherjee was asked if Blair had his full support. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he replied. Again, no nuances in sight.\nThe board\u2019s governing statute notes that the board may give orders and directions to the chief of police. There is no inkling that anyone provided the chief with effective orders or directions regarding the need to thoroughly investigate the conduct of his charges. Who gave him directions to go on the offensive with inflammatory remarks he made regarding the innocent who now is a Mr. Somebody or the SIU? If directions weren\u2019t given, why? And if orders were given to the chief, were they too politely offered and ineffective or were they just ignored? Either way, we have a failure to govern.\nThe board\u2019s next meeting is in the third week of January. For the sake of a safer city and in service of protecting the reputation of the remarkable performance of most of our police officers, it is time for a much more effective and tougher civilian oversight. Blair needs it and should be given the chance to see how he works with an effective board to either regain the people\u2019s confidence or be given an opportunity to do some gardening or run for political office.\nMy hope is that the mayor\u2019s new appointees along with the provincial choices will move away from the current feckless and cozy short-arm approach to more independent governance. While this longer-arm approach would mean a shorter leash for the chief, one that would not likely suit the unaccountable circumstances that suits his style of leadership, it\u2019s what he needs.\nAnd it\u2019s what the citizens of Toronto deserve."}

{"idx": "31999", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A court has ruled that the authorities cannot punish someone for smoking marijuana. But possession remains illegal.\nGeorgia has become the first former Soviet state to legalize the consumption of marijuana. But travelers looking for an ex-communist Amsterdam shouldn't head there just yet, as a haze still surrounds many of the technicalities of drug use.\nThe Georgian Constitutional Court\u2019s July 30 decision to drop punishment for the personal use of cannabis was indeed unprecedented for the ex-Soviet world, a region better known for its punitive anti-drug policies. But while Georgians can now legally smoke or otherwise consume marijuana, they still can\u2019t legally buy it. The purchase and possession of cannabis remains illegal, as the court ruling relates specifically to personal consumption.\n\u201cIf you have a joint and the police want to pat you down, light the joint up immediately and you will be good,\u201d one lawyer explained, only half-jokingly, in social media posts.\nTo resolve that conundrum, the Georgian parliament needs to pass new legislation. \u201cIf the state does not punish people for consuming a certain substance, then the parliament needs to address the question of how people can obtain that substance,\u201d Guram Imnadze, a lawyer with the Human Rights Education and Monitoring Center, said in an op-ed for Netgazeti.\nIn addition, while the Constitutional Court decision that consuming marijuana is a matter of personal freedom, the ruling also specifies that marijuana consumption must be subject to restrictions similar to those associated with alcohol and tobacco, to limit the impact on third parties and minors. This, too, is something that the parliament will have to address.\nBut lawmakers are facing an electorate that is largely hostile to the idea of legalization. In a newly released poll, 74 percent of respondents opposed the idea of marijuana legalization. Georgia\u2019s widely revered Orthodox Church has condemned the decision and even called for dissolving the court that rendered it.\n\u201cThe Constitutional Court should be abolished,\u201d Andria Jamghaidze, a senior church hierarch, told media. \u201cFour men make decisions [at the Constitutional Court] and they have a mandate to go against the entire nation\u2019s will.\u201d Other clerics also weighed in and echoed the sentiment.\nThe ruling Georgian Dream party dismissed the idea. \u201cThe Constitutional Court is the main enforcer of constitutional law in the country, and the country can\u2019t function without it,\u201d party member Tamar Chugoshvili said.\nOther Georgian Dream members\u2019 comments suggest, though, that the ruling party will try striking a balance between honoring the ruling of the Constitutional Court on the one hand and the will of the church and conservative voters on the other by putting in place stringent restrictions.\nSo don't start rolling your joints just yet.\nBut there is a strong civilian effort in Georgia to liberalize anti-drug laws that many human right activists regard as harsh and counterproductive for containing drug abuse, and it appears to be gaining momentum.\nThe legalization activists who brought the case to court celebrated victory. \u201cThis was not a fight for cannabis, this was a fight for freedom,\u201d said Zurab Japaridze, head of the libertarian political party Girchi and a co-applicant in the pot case.\nThis is Girchi's second marijuana-related Constitutional Court victory. Last year, the court ruled that criminal prosecution for personal use (as defined by the amount possessed) of marijuana was in contravention of the Constitution. But until this more recent decision, the consumption of marijuana remained a civil offense, punishable by a fine."}
