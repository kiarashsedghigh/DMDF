Put the pumpkin on a baking tray, toss with the oil and salt, and roast for 30 minutes, turning over once. The pumpkin should be tender and nicely coloured.\nHeat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy frying pan on a medium-low heat and add the mushrooms and aubergines. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the salt and pepper. Cook for a further 5 minutes, until the aubergine is soft. Stir in the oregano leaves and set aside in a bowl.\nIn the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on a medium-high heat and cook the onion and celery for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and seaweed and cook for another 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and combine with the aubergines and mushrooms.\nIn a food processor, combine half the beans, pecans, aubergine mix and rice with the miso, sifting in the bicarbonate of soda. Blitz to a thick paste. Add the breadcrumbs and the rest of the beans, rice and aubergine mix, along with the rest of the pecans. Pulse until a chunky mix forms, coarse in texture but finely chopped. Check the seasoning -the miso is quite salty. Transfer the mix to a bowl, combining it all well with your hands. Form the mix into 6-8 fat burgers. Put them into the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up. Meanwhile, make the tarragon aioli.\nPop an ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat and lightly oil it. Cook each burger for 5 minutes per side, until beautifully light brown. If they lose shape and are unruly in the pan, press them down using the back of a spatula.

That was so last summer.\nWhen the Chicago rapper broke into the mainstream seemingly out of nowhere in 2018, he efficiently distilled emo rap \u2014 one of the Soundcloud generation\u2019s iterations of trap, infused with the moody melodrama of self-pitying anguish \u2014 into memorable hooks, particularly on his chart-topping breakout single, \u201cLucid Dreams.\u201d Elsewhere on \u201cGoodbye & Good Riddance,\u201d listeners found the soundtrack to a breakup made up of largely monotonous trap production buoyed by keen pop-punk sensibilities.\nYet Juice\u2019s penchant for ear-worm melodies was burdened throughout by often laughably lovelorn lyrics that resembled the angsty, diaristic scrawl of a teen whose heartache over a months-long relationship\u2019s demise is perceived as the end of the universe. Standouts on the album were lost among this repetitive aura. But the simplicity of his hooks, while petulant, was also part of what made them undeniably catchy.\nJuice seemed to shift away from this schtick on last fall\u2019s collab record with Future on \u201cWRLD ON DRUGS,\u201d a forgettable and somewhat inexplicable \u2014 save for the pair\u2019s shared thirst for the numbing balm of addiction \u2014 link-up.

Indeed, Juice even throws in a tired dancehall-tinged pop track with \u201cHear Me Calling,\u201d along with a serviceable Travis Scott imitation on \u201cBig\u201d \u2014 which squanders a delicious sample and beat switch in the middle \u2014 to cover all his bases.\nThe agony and drug-love is still there, but is not as heightened or as clearly connected to a breakup. Rather, it\u2019s translated at times into some vague tortured soul character, as on \u201cEmpty,\u201d the album\u2019s opener, where Juice proclaims, \u201cI was put here to lead the lost souls / Exhale depression as the wind blows.\u201d The song\u2019s cringe-y lyrics again bog down what Juice does best. He wails infectiously, over beautifully tender piano, but with lines that elicit hard eye-rolls: \u201cMy world revolves around a black hole, the same black hole that\u2019s in place of my soul.\u201d Here, depression is less about suffering than about empty affectation and aesthetic; on \u201cGoodbye,\u201d it at least had a source, if naive and arguable on-the-surface.\nLight instrumental touches \u2014 the piano on \u201cRobbery,\u201d a xylophone underpinning \u201cFeeling\u201d \u2014 diversify the usual trap hi-hats, and most surprisingly, Juice showcase a relatively diverse palette of styles.

Thank goodness for that. He played great. A couple of his saves were spectacular.

One of the highlights of the tour was to be Yellowstone, where they arrived just as the shutdown went into effect.\nRangers systematically sent visitors out of the park, though some groups that had hotel reservations -- such as Vaillancourt's -- were allowed to stay for two days. Those two days started out on a sour note, she said.\nThe bus stopped along a road when a large herd of bison passed nearby, and seniors filed out to take photos. Almost immediately, an armed ranger came by and ordered them to get back in, saying they couldn't \"recreate.\" The tour guide, who had paid a $300 fee the day before to bring the group into the park, argued that the seniors weren't \"recreating,\" just taking photos.\n\"She responded and said, 'Sir, you are recreating,' and her tone became very aggressive,\" Vaillancourt said.\nThe seniors quickly filed back onboard and the bus went to the Old Faithful Inn, the park's premier lodge located adjacent to the park's most famous site, Old Faithful geyser. That was as close as they could get to the famous site -- barricades were erected around Old Faithful, and the seniors were locked inside the hotel, where armed rangers stayed at the door.\n\"They looked like Hulk Hogans, armed. They told us you can't go outside,\" she said. \"Some of the Asians who were on the tour said, 'Oh my God, are we under arrest?' They felt like they were criminals.\"\nBy Oct. 3 the park, which sees an average of 4,500 visitors a day, was nearly empty. The remaining hotel visitors were required to leave.\nAs the bus made its 2.5-hour journey out of Yellowstone, the tour guide made arrangements to stop at a full-service bathroom at an in-park dude ranch he had done business with in the past. Though the bus had its own small bathroom, Vaillancourt said seniors were looking for a more comfortable place to stop. But no stop was made -- Vaillancourt said the dude ranch had been warned that its license to operate would be revoked if it allowed the bus to stop. So the bus continued on to Livingston, Mont., a gateway city to the park.\nI actually think the Gestapo would have been nicer. Or at least, more professional.\nWhat we are witnessing all over the country is the arbitrary exercise of power. Or, to put it more succinctly - tyranny. When the minions of government feel empowered to bully, threaten, and mistreat those they are supposedly serving - even without the full knowledge of the president - we are experiencing what most concerned the founders about government; arbitrary authority unchecked by constitutional restraints.\nWe had an intersting discussion about this on my radio show last night with Matt Lewis of the Daily Caller and Hot Air's Jazz Shaw. The question was: how much of this shutdown theater is really the result of legal restraints on what government can do during a shutdown and how much was the arbitrary and capricious exercise of power?

But implementing an early warning system on a scale big enough to protect whole cities is extremely expensive. However, researchers at Stanford University believe they have a cheap solution. It's cheap because we already installed it!\nStanford geophysics professor Biondo Biondi is leading a research team developing a continuous earthquake monitoring system using optical fibers. Those are the same fibers already present throughout every major city allowing us all to enjoy high-speed Internet access.\nBiondi's group have been experimenting with a three-mile loop of optical fiber installed at the Stanford University campus. Importantly, there is nothing novel about this loop. It's optical fiber sitting inside a plastic cable under the ground, just like commercial cabling.\nThe earthquake detection works thanks to acoustic sensing. Light travelling along an optical fiber always encounters impurities and some of the light bounces back. This is known as a \"backscatter signal.\" What Biondi's team realized is that \"vibration or strain\" on the fiber changes the backscatter signal and this can be monitored.\nBy understanding how the backscatter signal varies it is possible to detect seismic events at a scale and precision we haven't seen before. So sensitive is this so-called \"fiber optic seismic observatory,\" it even records man-made events. The Stanford loop felt the recent Mexico earthquake as well as detecting two local small earthquakes measuring 1.6 and 1.8 in magnitude.\nThe system can also detect P and S seismic waves. P waves are particularly important to detect as they arrive before S waves and are typically the first waves felt from a seismic event. Detecting P waves means knowing earlier that an earthquake is imminent.\nScaling Biondi's system up, it's easy to see the benefits. Take any major city, hook into the existing optical fiber network, and you have an instant network of earthquake sensing cabling without having to install anything new."}

In this discussion, something that has repeatedly come up is that whatever their faults, the major conservative Christian political organizations that have been so vocally fighting these wars are essential and good (See: David French). We might not like them, but we need them. Abortion and Gay Marriage are such important issues that we cannot afford to be critical about conservative Christian groups, so the argument goes.\nAmong those organizations that have been defended by some is the Family Research Council, one of the most well-known and influential conservative Christian political groups. Recently, FRC has gotten into the news for giving a pro-family award to a pastor who compared homosexuals to maggots and murderers. Even after calls for them to rescind the award, the FRC stood by its decision (See Matthew Lee Anderson\u2019s commentary).\nOver the years liberal watchdog sites have attacked FRC over various incidences, and some criticisms have been warranted, others not so much. Last week I was surprised to read the FRC appoint Gen. (Ret). Jerry Boykin, an infamous and controversial figure, as their new Executive Vice President.\nThis appointment captures for me many of the reasons why I suspect (hope, and pray) that many Christians in the coming decades will increasingly move away from supporting traditionally popular and influential conservative Christian political groups, like FRC, unless they dramatically change. Boykin promotes debunked conspiracy theories which speak dishonorably about our president, has a history of advocating the suspension of rights to Muslim citizens, promotes unbiblical and dangerous theology, and has close connections with strange and disreputable groups.\nBoykin is a leader in The Oak Initiative, a conservative Christian political group headed by Rick Joyner. The group promotes various conspiracy theories, makes \u201cprophetic\u201d statements about the future, and claims things like, \u201cOur Justice Department recently stated in a memo that they consider those who often refer to the Bible or to the Constitution as threats,\u201d\u2013which is patently false.\nAt the start of this video, Boykin says that Muslims should have the right to worship, but it\u2019s not entirely clear how we are supposed to reconcile that statement with the one quoted above. Similarly, he once said on a radio show, \u201cSeal the borders and eliminate sanctuary cities and they\u2019ll go home. No mosques in America. Islam is a totalitarian way of life; it\u2019s not just a religion.\u201d He later stated that he misspoke and was actually referring to the Ground Zero Mosque, but as RightWingWatch shows, that excuse doesn\u2019t add up. He\u2019s had several other major Islam-related gaffs; one was even denounced by then-President Bush.\nIn regard to his theology, at his ministry website, Gen. Boykin misuses II Chron 7:14 to support the idea that if we simply repent, then God will bless the US, as He promised to Israel (See FRC\u2019s \u201cCall2Fall\u201d similarly misuse the verse).

This year was no different.\nIn 2018, people chucked ancient dinosaur tracks into a reservoir in Utah, poached almost 90 elephants in Africa, and knocked over an ancient rock formation.\nIt's no secret that people aren't always appreciative of their surroundings. Whether up in the air or traveling abroad, people have done some horrible things to their environment.\nWhen it comes to nature, this rings especially true. This year people have made headlines by vandalizing, destroying, or tampering with some of the world's most gorgeous natural environments.\nFrom defacing a national monument to shattering a rock formation millions of years in the making, here's how people have damaged nature in 2018.\nIn Spain, someone carved their name into a dolphin that washed up on shore.\nIn December, a five-foot dolphin washed up on a beach in Spain and had the name \"Juan\" carved into its body. The dolphin also had other injuries all over its body. Investigators believe the carving was not done at the beach but out at sea, and a storm washed the dolphin up on shore. The Department of Marine Service has been investigating other similar events.\nEquinac, an organization in Spain devoted to marine animal rescue, told local media, \"To you Juan, the one who did this, we only want to say that with a bit of luck we will catch you for another offense.\"\nA group of tourists pushed a rock formation that dates back millions of years off a cliff in England.\nThe Brimham Rocks is a National Trust site in North Yorkshire, England, and the rocks there have been shaped by wind, rain, and ice for millions of years. But that didn't stop a group of teenagers from pushing one of the 320 million-year-old formations over a cliff this June, destroying the monument.\n\"They went at it for quite a while to get the momentum to push it off. So there was definitely intent there,\" Catherine Barber, a ranger at the Brimham Rocks, told CBC. \"It's a great shame because that stone's been there and has been rocked by many visitors over hundreds of years, and it's just a shame now that it will [no longer] be there for the people to come in and try.\"\nAnother group of tourists damaged a 40 million-year-old land formation in China.\nRed and yellow sands of Zhangye Danxia.\nIn August, four Chinese tourists entered an ancient landform in a geopark in China called Zhangye Danxia. They posted a video when they broke into a roped off area and damaged most of the surroundings.\nIn the video, you can see the tourists walking on red and yellow sand while also digging their feet into it. The bottom layers of the landform were created 40 to 100 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, according to the South China Morning Post, and the top layers are a result of erosion, estimated to have been formed 200,000 to 400,000 years ago.\nBut in the video, one of them casually brags, \"I destroyed a 6,000-year-old [formation.\" Only two were arrested for the crime.\nIn Utah, dinosaur tracks that date back"}

One day, after leaving the bar, I was headed down Greenwich Avenue toward Christopher Street, when I spot- ted a figure standing on a corner. He was dressed all in leather, and the way he smoked---it was like watching someone ingest a delicious new kind of food. I paused. The man stared at me over his tinted glasses. I kept walking, and he started to follow me, and did for several blocks, until I panicked and ducked into a shop. This must have been in , be- cause Rainer Werner Fassbinder was dead the next year. What impressed me on that long-ago afternoon was not only the man's leather--- even leather queens wouldn't have dared to gear up so completely in that heat---but his doggedness when it came to checking out and trying to make friends with men of color. (I saw him around town all week- end, trying to get a break with the broth- ers; New York was smaller then.) Men of color played a big role in Fassbinder's films. I didn't know who he was until I read his obituary in the Village Voice. I don't think I had seen any of his full-length films---let alone his two television series---before that exchange, or non-exchange, but once I did I found a whole queer world that had itself been queered by war, racism, sexism, and the old ways in which being German or European didn't work in the New World. But Fassbinder, a native of Bavaria, didn't start out making films; he was turned down by the Berlin Film School when he applied, in . So he joined Munich's Action Theatre and worked with actors, in addition to writing scripts and acting himself. Pretty soon, he was in charge of the whole thing, and the newly named Anti-Theatre featured some ten plays, almost all of which he either wrote or directed. One of them was \"The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,\" which is being mounted by Third Space, directed by Benjamin Viertel, at the New Ohio The- atre (in previews, opening Feb. ). A six-character piece for women, the play is a fascinating rococo experiment in power---the sadomasochism that, for Fassbinder, at least, defines most human interactions. (One longs to see what he would have made of \"Remembrance of Things Past.\") In , Fassbinder directed a film version of the play; in that world, the rest of the universe was closed o , and the ivory shag carpeting in the home of the fashion designer von Kant was the stage for great sensual pleasure, lies, and denial. Despite the fact that the script is more than forty years old, it retains its youthful questions and vigor. (Viertel is adding a new fifth act, with songs drawn from cast interviews and essays.) So it's more than appropriate that it's being put on by Third Space, a young company in a city that has always struggled to support its young companies.

It explores the relationship between the child and the State, which has assumed care in the role of a \u2018parent\u2019.\nFour years back, when President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca was family minister, Dr Farrugia chaired the commission entrusted with drafting the Child Protection Act. The draft was tabled in Parliament but was then revised by Dr Coleiro Preca\u2019s successor as family minister, Michael Farrugia.\nThe revised Child Protection (Alternative Care) Act became law last January but has not yet been enforced, pending a legal notice.\nAhead of the initial drafting, the National Commission for Child Policy and Strategy, led by Dr Farrugia, met with children in out-of-home-care to ensure their concerns were reflected in the new law.\n\u201cOne of the most traumatic things for children is being taken away from their parents. Even if things aren\u2019t well at home, taking a child away remains the biggest thing in their life.\nAs things stand, care orders are signed off by the Family Minister.\n\u201cChildren are aware that this is a big change in their life and what they get after this change depends very much on the luck of the draw,\u201d Dr Farrugia said, insisting on the importance of moving child protection out of the ministry and into the hands of an autonomous structure.\nThis was important as ministers were politicians and had a very difficult balancing act to respond to the electorate\u2019s demands while taking the best decisions in children\u2019s interest, she noted.\nMeanwhile, children needed to be able to access justice. What can children do if something goes wrong in residential care or foster care?\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve already lost your home and you\u2019re in another one, where do you go? There is nowhere to go. How can you speak up against the only place you have? Children either run away or suffer in silence.\nFor Dr Farrugia, who first started consulting the Family Ministry in 1987, \u201cthe law is about people in general, families in particular and children especially\u201d.\nIf the State placed a child under a care order, it is pledging that it can do better than their birth parents.\nRuth Farrugia is concerned that because of the limited investment in foster care in Malta, and lack of serious commitment to long term planning for each child in out-of-home care, half the children in out-of-home care are in residential care.\nWhile the number of children being placed in residential care is increasing, a number of them could possibly be freed for adoption, she says.\nOpen adoption would still allow the child to meet their birth relatives.\nThe conference this week is called \u2018Setting Sail from a Safe Port: Giving our children confidence to move forward with safe and permanent relationships\u2019. The issues discussed will include where children in care hail from and what their needs are. Speakers will also look into the implications of mandatory reporting of child abuse by professionals, and the need to further develop healthcare service provision for children in care."}

I have been both an adult and community college ESL teacher at SDCE Mid-City Center and Grossmont College for over 30 years. I have worked with people from all over the world and their resilience never ceases to amaze me. In one class, I can have students ranging in age from 18 to 65 and from different socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, but they all have a mutual goal. They want to learn English and forge a better life for themselves and their children. For the most part, it is not easy.\nFor example, many of the Middle Eastern students arrive with horrific stories to tell about losing family members, about bombs and kidnappings, and about living every day with fear and uncertainty. They view this country as a haven, but then a harsh reality sets in. They have a sense of stability and freedom here, but they also have to learn a new language, find a place to live, find a job, enroll their children in school, learn how to drive, and navigate all the different paths that come with a new life. It can be daunting. I have had students who study during the day, work all night, and get by on two-three hours sleep!\nYet, they don\u2019t give up. The good news is many of them thrive and go on to become productive citizens. We ESL teachers have had so many success stories! Back in the late 1980s, I had a shy Vietnamese student in my evening class who became a primary care doctor at Kaiser. In fact, his office is next door to my doctor\u2019s office! I had a student from Guatemala who is now a popular teacher at Morse High School. He also does community volunteer work. There was my Iranian student who went on to become an engineer and is currently working for the city of San Diego. Then, there was my Somali student who had never gone to school in her country. She learned how to read and write here. Today, she is getting ready to attend college as well as being a wife and mother.\nRight now, there are my Iraqi students at Grossmont College. These students are Chaldean, Muslim, and Kurdish, and they do not take for granted how lucky they are to be here. President Trump\u2019s executive order surprises and saddens them, especially those who worked with the American military. They can\u2019t understand why the men who worked with American soldiers and risked their lives are not allowed to come now with their families. Yet, they don\u2019t lose hope. They see bright futures for their children and encourage them to study hard.\nWe have a young man who shines as a tutor in our ESL program at Grossmont College. His wise father encouraged him to take college classes. This young man came up the ranks in our program and decided he wants to give back. His love of learning is infectious. He is a full time student, who in addition to tutoring also works 25 hours a week at a liquor store, sometimes dealing with crazy customers.\nFinally, all of the Middle Eastern students have been thoroughly vetted before they get here, many waiting several years and going through many interviews before they are allowed in. We all have our prejudices, but I would hope that as a nation of immigrants [I am the Jewish granddaughter of immigrants], we could rise above those prejudices and the fear of the unknown and welcome these new immigrants who want to make a new life for themselves and enrich their adopted land.\nMiriam [Mimi] Pollack is an ESL instructor"}

Africa what? Africa where? That continent where those nasty guys dragged our Black Hawk boys through the streets of Mogadishu? The less time and money we spend out there, the better.

The US is ALL over Africa - c\u2019est evident.\nThen suddenly, on Jan. 11, the Malian intervention began and the French could not get enough of the dreaded USA.\nAt every edit meeting, I was being asked to write about US cooperation \u2013 or the lack thereof \u2013 in the Malian intervention.

OPAC is now ratified by 168 countries, including, recently, by the Central African Republic.\nThe Optional Protocol enshrined the idea that children do not belong in armed groups or forces in conflict. This is why this day is also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers.\nToday, I would like to use the opportunity to urge all those countries who have not yet had the opportunity to do so to join OPAC.\nUniversal ratification is not only symbolic. It\u2019s a necessary step to demonstrate our shared commitment on the path towards universal implementation.\nWe also meet less than a week after the signing of a peace and reconciliation agreement between the Government of the Central African Republic and 14 armed groups. An agreement brokered notably by the African Union, the UN, with negotiations supported by Sudan and taking place in Khartoum.\nI personally advocated, jointly with colleagues on the ground, for child protection issues to be discussed during the peace talks and for the inclusion of measures to protect boys and girls in this peace agreement, including sustainable reintegration of children formerly associated with armed groups.\nI am encouraged to see that the parties recognized that children and women were the most affected by conflict in the Central African Republic and that some important child protection provisions were taken into account by the parties.\nPeace agreements come with lots of hope and this one is no exception.\nAs we meet today, the words of the President of the Central African Republic still resonate.\nPresident Faustin Touadera called on the citizens of his country \u2013 and all those who can support \u2013 to join forces to rebuild, to feed, educate and heal all boys and girls. And indeed, the peace agreement brings tangible opportunities to do just that, especially for the children of the CAR.\nMy colleague Natalie will have more on the challenges and opportunities that children currently face in the country. But allow me to say a few words to emphasize how our most recent data demonstrates the devastating impact of this conflict on boys and girls.\nWhich also brings us to the precise topic of today\u2019s discussion. Insecurity, access restrictions and attacks on humanitarian personnel and infrastructure, contributed to the shrinking of humanitarian space. According to the Country Task Force, there were 120 security incidents against humanitarian actors recorded last year. Enough for 25 humanitarian organizations to decide that their only option was to suspend their operations. Six humanitarian workers were killed, 23 others injured and 5 more were abducted.\nIn a country where more than half of the population, require humanitarian assistance to cover basic needs, including 1.5 million children, colleagues from the UN and NGO community struggle on a daily basis to provide life-saving assistance. Women and children are increasingly exposed to protection risks.\nIn 2018, Indiscriminate attacks on civilians resulted in deaths and maiming of children and continued to trigger mass displacements of populations throughout the country.\nThe recruitment and use of children by armed groups continued including reports of children used by armed groups as human shields. Many boys and girls were abducted, mainly for recruitment purposes.\nSexual"}

I\u2019m personally not persuaded that the Australian people disagree with the proposition that a member of the federal parliament should be an Australian citizen only,\" Senator Cormann said on Friday.\nLabor MP Andrew Giles, deputy chair of the committee, said resolving the issue was important to rebuild trust and confidence in politics.\n\"Labor has for quite some time supported removing unnecessary impediments preventing Australians from seeking public office,\" Mr Giles said.\nLiberal MP Scott Buchholz said the drafters of the constitution couldn't have foreseen the \"unintended consequences\" of section 44 and expressed a concern that \"tremendous\" people were currently being deterred from public office because of their heritage.\n\"I\u2019m of the mind that there was a consistent position [expressed by experts who appeared before the committee] that, in order for things to change, there needs to be an amendment or removal of some parts of the constitution,\" Mr Buchholz told Fairfax Media.\n\"Whether the Australian public has that appetite, that\u2019s a conversation we will have to have with the Parliament and people.\"\nGreens senator Lee Rhiannon said a referendum was necessary because section 44 was \"inconsistent with Australia in the 21st century\".\nOne source said the committee would inevitably conclude a referendum was the only way to deal with the ongoing saga but cautioned the recommendations have not yet been finalised. The report is likely to be handed down in coming weeks.\nIt remains unclear what form a proposed amendment would take. Two options are the simple removal of section 44 (i), which specifically covers citizenship, or amending it to give Parliament the authority to set its own standard. The committee has also heard arguments for a sweeping examination of all eligibility requirements outlined in section 44, which also covers criminal records, bankruptcy and financial conflicts of interest.\nThe latest comments from MPs build on the view expressed earlier this week by Liberal committee chair Linda Reynolds, who called on the Parliament to \"resolve the citizenship issue once and for all\" via a public vote.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said Senator Reynolds had \"pointed to a real problem in the constitution\" that wouldn't be included if the document was being drafted today.\n\"But I have to say that when it comes to updating our constitution, my first priorities are to recognise our First Australians in the nation's birth certificate, to give a voice which would allow Aboriginal Australians to have"}

But it\u2019s really an advanced bundle of sensors that is with us nearly 24 hours a day, collecting massive amounts of data. Doctors and health professionals are only now starting to understand the opportunity this data can provide. Take a new app that helps silently identify diabetes patients who might be slipping with their treatments.\nAlmost one in 10 people in the United States suffer from diabetes (and millions more people are on the brink of getting the disease). Having diabetes can often mean developing mental health issues, including stress and anxiety. All of these problems can lead to lapses in managing the disease. Ginger.io, the winner of Sanofi-aventis\u2019s $100,000 Data Design Diabetes challenge to develop a scalable, data-driven product that can benefit anyone in the diabetes ecosystem, keeps track of potentially dangerous mental health issues through a smartphone app\u2013and it does it all without user input.\nGinger.io, a spinoff company from the MIT Media Lab, didn\u2019t originally aim to help diabetes patients. As part of his thesis, Ginger.io cofounder Anmol Madan collected 320,000 hours of data from research participants\u2019 cell phones. The result: Madan figured out what kinds of cell phone use patterns signal the beginning of issues like the flu or anxiety.\nSo Madan teamed up with two MIT alumni to launch Ginger.io\u2019s smartphone platform, which runs in the background and analyzes call frequency, location, and text messaging habits to figure out when users are under the weather. The app only looks at statistics, so it doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re at Burger King and calling your mother. But it does know if you\u2019re staying in one place all the time and neglecting to call anybody.\nThe diabetes application was an afterthought. \u201cWe stumbled upon the use case in diabetes. After looking through clinical literature, we saw a correlation between mood and diabetes,\u201d says Ginger.io cofounder Karan Singh.\nThe core platform and algorithm for the app is ready to go; now Ginger.io just needs to work on \u201cwhat that last level of user experience will look like,\u201d says Singh. Next year, the startup will run a study with diabetic patients and clinicians to test whether the caregiver alerts make a difference in disease management.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about having a chance to deploy this,\u201d says Singh."}

{"idx": "33066", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Osteoarthritis is a joint disease that affects the cartilage. Risk factors include age, weight, previous injury, repetitive joint stress and genetics. Regular exercise, such as jogging, reduces weight and keeps the joints moving. However, jogging is a high-impact exercise and can contribute to an increased risk. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop jogging, but in order to reduce your risk of osteoarthritis, you may need to make some changes to your workout routine.\nPerform regular stretching exercises. Stretching your muscles promotes flexibility and improves blood circulation. Regular stretching and range-of-motion exercises will keep joints moving freely. This is especially true of the knee joint for jogging. Regular stretching improves the elasticity of knee cartilage.\nAdd strength training to your workout routine. Strengthening the muscles that support your joints reduces the risk of joint injury when jogging, thus reducing your risk of osteoarthritis.\nChoose running shoes designed for jogging and running. Shoes designed for runners help absorb the joint impact and help protect the joints while jogging.\nChange your jogging surface. Because jogging is a high-impact sport, jogging on surfaces such as concrete increases the impact and the risk of injury. Consider changing to a softer surface such as grass, dirt, a synthetic track or a treadmill.\nReduce the impact of your jogging workout by moving it to the swimming pool. A 2012 study presented by Dr. Thomas M. Link, chief of the Musculoskeletal Imaging Section in the University of California San Francisco's Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, shows that regular high-impact exercise increases the risk of osteoarthritis. On the flip-side, low levels of activity also increase the risk. The study showed that moderate exercise levels provided the greatest risk reduction. By moving your jogging routine to the pool, you get the aerobic benefits as well as the joint movement, without the impact on the joints.\nBefore starting a new jogging routine, consult a physician to rule out any possible medical concerns.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Services: What is Osteoarthritis?\nUniversity of California San Francisco: Preventing Osteoarthritis: How Much Exercise is Just Right?"}
{"idx": "33067", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Add junk bonds to the list of asset classes feeling the ripple effects of the recent rise in Treasury yields.\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that junk bond yields were continually setting record lows. The Barclays U.S. High Yield Index dropped below 5% for the first time ever on May 7. But it quickly made a U-turn, climbing nearly 100 basis points over the next month to yield 5.91% on Tuesday.\nThe 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, climbed roughly 50 basis points during May as speculation mounted over how the Federal Reserve may act to wind down its bond purchase program, which has artificially held yields down.\nBut because high-yield bonds sold off even more than Treasurys, the yield premium junk bond investors demanded over government debt, or spread, actually widened. That\u2019s not usually the case for high yield bonds, which tend to be more isolated from benchmark Treasurys than other fixed-income asset classes.\nWhenever Treasurys have sold off by at least 50 basis points over the last 15 years, spreads have tightened, according to the chart below from TIAA-CREF. That means junk bonds increased in attractiveness relative to their government debt peers.\nBut option adjusted spreads to Treasurys were hovering around 4% when junk bonds hit their lowest yield. That was lower than where spreads were before prior to most other Treasury sell-offs. So when the haven government bond yields rose, there wasn\u2019t as much room for spreads to come in. Spreads widened to about 4.6% on Tuesday.\nAs a basis for comparison, spreads were similarly tight during Treasury selloffs between 2004 and 2006, and though spreads tightened as Treasury yields rose, they did so only barely, according to TIAA-CREF data.\nThe widening isn\u2019t indicative of an increase in risk in the asset class; default rates have remained low even as they spark worries about protections for bondholders. If anything, it\u2019s a reflection of the impact of uncertain monetary policy on all asset classes.\n\\\u201dHigh yield hasn\u2019t been high yield for several years, even if spreads are historically in line. A rise in rates is going to have an outsized affect,\\\u201d said Jeremy Hill, managing director at TF Market Advisors, LLC.\nKevin Lorenz, portfolio manager of the TIAA-CREF High-Yield Retail Fund, likes to envision junk bonds as a middle ground between high-grade corporates with less credit risk and higher-risk equities. High yield bond returns usually fall between those two asset classes, and they continued to do so during the month of May, Lorenz said.\nSo, where does that leave investors? It depends on your timeframe."}

But many organisations could benefit more from experimenting with mobi sites before they develop their apps strategies since the reach is wider while the barriers to entry and the risks are relatively low.\nCompanies need to take a strategic approach to mobile content and services. By starting out with low-cost channels such as .mobi sites, companies can start to understand the needs of their users. Then, they will have a better idea of what the potential return on investment is from a mobile app and what users would require from it before they start to build it.\nDeveloping a mobile app for just one smartphone platform \u2013 be it Apple\u2019s iOS, Android, Windows Mobile or BlackBerry OS \u2013 is already expensive. Costs quickly mount up when one starts to develop mobile apps for multiple platforms to cover the fragmented high-end smartphone market.\nBy contrast, the .mobi portal offers the advantage of being accessible from any device that has web access \u2013 it can be accessed from all newer smartphones as well as the older web-enabled cellphones in the market.\nThis approach will also help you to understand your mobile business model, your customers\u2019 appetite for mobile services and the platforms that your customers are using before you make the not-insubstantial investment in developing apps as smartphone penetration ramps up over the next two years. By this time, advanced features such as location-based services will also be more popular and mature, offering a wealth of new possible ways to interact with smartphone users.\nCompanies should be looking at mobile as a channel in its own right and considering how to align with their other channels. They cannot simply copy and paste their web strategies into the mobile world because the way that customers behave across the two channels is vastly different.\nThey should tailor their mobile websites, search campaigns and display advertising accordingly. For example, a mobile customer is likely to be looking for quick gratification when he or she goes online to search for the telephone number of a restaurant.\nAnd users are more likely to be using the mobile web after hours and over the weekend than they are during the week, since many South Africans still only have Internet access at work. These realities should all inform one\u2019s mobile strategy."}

More than 3 million players play pickleball in the United States and that number has been growing by more than 10 percent each year over the past decade.\nThe love of the game was evident during a recent outing at Sun-N-Fun RV Resort, where a group of more than 20 players were playing on a humid summer morning.\n\"This grows so much for a lot of reasons, but I think a big part of that is because we're dealing with an aging population,\" said Tom Everitt of the Sarasota Pickleball Club. \"A lot of those people play tennis, but Pickleball is a lot easier on the body. You're not running like crazy like you did when you were 20.\n\"We're in our 60's and 70's ... and I even play with some people that are into their 80's. They come out, they play, improve their game and they get addicted to it.\"\nPickleball is played on a badminton-sized court that is roughly a quarter of the size of a tennis court.\nHowever, the similarities between pickleball and tennis end there.\nServes in pickleball are underhand and there are no long volleys like in tennis.\nThe game is played around what is called the kitchen line which is seven feet from the net. Serves are not allowed to fall in the kitchen area and any player that steps inside the kitchen line during play \u2014 even if the ball has already cleared the net on a return \u2014 surrenders a point. Games are played to 11 points and singles or doubles teams must win by two.\n\"Pickleball is not that hard and it's easy to learn,\" said Carrie Palmer. \"Anyone can learn this game and play it. The rules are simple.\"\nScott Tingley is a professional pickleball player who teaches the sport to new players around the area. Tingley, who has won more than 40 medals and earned bronze in the 5.0 players bracket at the 2016 U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in men's doubles, said the biggest parts of pickleball are its social aspects and the competitive nature of the game that allows middle-aged to retired people to have an outlet to exercise every day.\n\"Because the court is smaller, it helps those who have mobility issues have an outlet for a lot of exercise,\" he said. \"I average 25,000 to 30,000 steps a day teaching and playing, so for those who say you can't get a lot of exercise that's definitely not true.\"\nPalmer was a racquetball player that was immediately drawn to pickleball. She said that she knew she was addicted within two minutes of picking up a paddle for the first time. Now she plays all over the country.\n\"You meet the greatest people playing pickleball,\" Palmer said. \"The contact list on my phone has expanded tremendously because of the friends I've made in this game. It's just a lot of fun.\"\nThere are currently no outdoor public courts dedicated to pickleball in north Saras"}

He\u2019s great.\nCurrently playing at the Regal Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, this film is destined for more than one Oscar nomination this year. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron and Susan Sarandon in a gripping tale that, on one level, is a gristly murder mystery and on another is an interesting and thoughtful contemplation of the influence of war upon its participants.\nIt begins simply enough. Tommy Lee Jones, an ex-M.P., hears that his son has returned from fighting in Iraq. He sets out to find him, and with the aid of police detective Charlize Theron, learns that his son has been killed right here in the U.S.\nAs in his earlier Oscar-winning film \u201cCrash,\u201d writer-director Haggis supplies all the pieces to the puzzle in short, dramatic clips, and leaves it to you to put the (sometimes) heavy-handed message together.\nWell, he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for \u201cThe Fugitive,\u201d and he\u2019s got a great shot at winning Best Actor for \u201cElah.\u201d With body language and facial expression more than dialogue, he displays the emotional turmoil beneath the surface of a man in search of his son and his son\u2019s killers.\nHowever, his overly-keen private eye didn\u2019t lessen my respect for Tommy Lee\u2019s work one bit. He\u2019s just great, and the film rings shudderingly truthful.\nI don\u2019t want to give away any of the plot points, or it would lessen the impact of this forceful film.\nThe cinematography is simply exquisite. Sarandon has only a few scenes, as the mourning wife, but all are little gems of acting skill and photography. And an old favorite, Barry Corbin (he played Maurice in \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d), has a brief and effective cameo.\nOh, and as to the title: the valley of Elah is the biblical spot where David and Goliath had it out. Luckily, Haggis lets you make of that what you will.\nJust be aware that Paul Haggis doesn\u2019t deal with trifles. No light comedies for this guy. After writing the screenplays for \u201cCrash\u201d and then \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d and winning Oscars for both, he worked on the scripts for both of Clint Eastwood\u2019s Iwo Jima films and then put together an extremely dark and brooding TV series called \u201cThe Black Donnellys\u201d about an Irish mob of gangsters.\nWhile fascinating, it was almost too bleak for even my gloomy sensibilities.

The newsletter offered a money-back guarantee, which almost put him under financially after the stock market crash of 1987.\nHe talked to a mentor about how to handle the roiling market, and Staton said he learned that quality companies would outlast the ups and downs of the economy. He then created and sold a list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s finest companies,\u201d a group that had paid a higher cash dividend annually for at least ten years, annually for many years.\nOne day, he received a letter from a prisoner in California asking if Staton would mail him his financial investing guide.\nStation sent the material, and that interaction resulted in him leading investment classes in prisons for both inmates and wardens, including in Mecklenburg County jails. He\u2019s since had his investment guides mailed to prisons and jails around the country.\nIn Charlotte, he takes time out of his work schedule regularly to lead free, one-hour investment classes for prisoners and people in rehabilitation.\nStaton said his own past struggle with alcoholism, which he manages now with the help daily support group meetings at a South Charlotte church, help him relate to the people in his classes.\nStaton explained to the class that they could invest directly in many big-name companies, which typically required several hundred dollars initially and then a $50 monthly investment for a set amount of time.\nHe explained that \u201ccompanies love when you invest directly.

In reviewing the petition, the judge must consider mitigating factors of youth, the diminished culpability of youth compared to adults, the defendant\u2019s history of abuse or neglect during childhood, the defendant\u2019s work towards rehabilitation, the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the recommendations of the U.S. Attorney and Bureau of Prisons. The bill also includes due process protections, providing individuals with the rights to a hearing, counsel, to present evidence, to speak, and the right to an appeal.\nH.R. 6011 is about mercy and redemption for America\u2019s children and represents common-sense reform that properly balances protecting public safety with the need to treat children differently from adults in the criminal justice system. The legislation does not guarantee the release of anyone who has committed a serious crime as a child, but rather provides the opportunity for a judge to review lengthy prison sentences imposed on our youth.\nScientific evidence shows that youth are fundamentally different from adults because of their immature brain development, and their weaker impulse control and reasoning abilities. Because their brains are not fully developed youth also have a unique potential to grow and to be rehabilitated. These facts led the U.S. Supreme Court to conclude on several occasions that youth must be treated differently by the criminal justice system.\nIn every aspect of society we recognize children are different: We don\u2019t allow kids to smoke, drink alcohol, get married, enter into contracts, vote, join the military, work in certain environments, or make certain decisions, because we recognize that they are still developing, that they are not yet fully mature. H.R. 6011 brings this same logic and line of reasoning into how we treat children when they commit serious crimes.\nExtreme sentences like life without parole are also most frequently imposed upon the most vulnerable members of our society. Nearly 80 percent of juvenile lifers reported witnessing violence in their homes; more than half (54.1%) witnessed weekly violence in their neighborhoods. In addition, 50 percent of all children sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole have been physically abused and 20 percent have been sexually abused during their life. For girls serving life without parole sentences, more than 80 percent have been sexually assaulted.\nLike much of our criminal justice system, the racial disparities are also extreme. Children of color are disproportionately sentenced to die in prison, with black children serving life without parole at a per capita rate that is 10 times that of white children convicted of the same offense.\nH.R. 6011 will bring the federal government in line with emerging juvenile brain and behavioral development science, as well as similar policies from states like Arkansas, Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia, California, and 15 others, which have all banned life without the possibility of release from being imposed on children.\nThis bill aligns with our values as being a nation of second chances and our belief that there is no such thing as a \u2018throw-away\u2019 child.

It will aim to find a common agreement between the food chain and regulators on a proposed way forward to promote the availability of newer and more efficient plant protection solutions for minor uses. This problem was acknowledged in the Regulation by the commitment to investigate within 2 years the establishment of a European fund for minor uses. The Conference will also examine possible options on how this fund could work.\nLuc Peeters, chairman of the phytosanitary group within COPA-COGECA and representing the eight food chain associations said: \u201cThis Conference is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness and share experiences that are put in practice today and we are confident that it will be the first step in finding sustainable solutions\u201d.\nA large number of crops grown in Europe that are of major importance for the food industry and consumers are relatively minor, both in scale of production and also in their use of plant protection products, when compared to the total agricultural production. While the magnitude of pest problems faced in these crops is similar to major crops, many newer and more efficient plant protection solutions are often unavailable to farmers and the food chain operators, mostly for economic reasons. The withdrawal of numerous plant protection products in recent years has exacerbated the problem creating several gaps in plant protection solutions. The availability of an adequate crop protection toolbox for the future is a key element to support farmers to continue producing minor crops as well as ensuring a safe and efficient completion of the food supply chain."}

It included a fresh ballot of high school teachers who had previously voted \u201cno confidence\u201d in Kukenberger.\nThe districtwide vote was 185-91, with 67 percent voting \u201cno confidence\u201d and 33 percent voting \u201cconfidence,\u201d said Justin Stebbins, union president.

We familiarize ourselves with the products. We play all the games,\" Sahr said. \"We try to be competitive with Amazon as much as we can but we won't be able to always have the lower price. But we can answer questions, open the box and show you and the kids the toys.\"\nSharon DiMinico, CEO and founder of Learning Express Toys, a company with more than 120 independently owned franchised stores, agreed that local stores need to offer a unique experience and products you may not be able to find at bigger stores.\nIt can't be just about offering the same toys from Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) that will inevitably be cheaper to buy from Amazon or Walmart.\n\"We have a few licenses but we don't chase everything that's being advertised on TV. That really hasn't paid off,\" DiMinico said. \"We have to be pretty selective about what we buy.\"\nLearning Express Toys started in 1987, so DiMinico has lived through a lot of big shifts in the industry.\n\"We have been able to withstand the growth of Amazon and Walmart,\" she said. \"We've coexisted with Toys 'R' Us for 30 years. I like to think of us as an intelligent alternative in the toy business.\"\nFor *play's Kienzle, it's also about going the extra mile to make sure customers are happy and keep coming back.\n\"We want to make it convenient for the modern parents. We deliver. People can call ahead and order or text an order.

According to a new federal telework survey, about 40 percent of federal employees were eligible for telework in 2004, but only 18.6 percent of them took advantage of it.\nThe Office of Personnel Management\u2019s 2005 survey report shows, however, that expanded marketing efforts contributed to significant increases in telework. To promote telework, OPM and the General Services Administration created a telework Web site, held Webinars, visited agencies and made presentations at conferences. Those efforts apparently were successful. In 2004, 140,694 out of 1.8 million federal employees were teleworkers.\nHalf of those teleworkers routinely worked from home or a nearby telework center an average of six days a month. The other half did so only on a limited basis \u2014 typically three days a month \u2014 during an extended illness or family crisis.\nAgencies reported using a combination of low- and high-tech arrangements for monitoring the work of their offsite employees. A telework contract served as a monitoring mechanism in 70 percent of the agencies surveyed, but 40 percent of the agencies said they used electronic tracking systems.\nThe Labor Department reported 50 percent, or 7,845, of its eligible employees actually did perform telework in 2004. The Commerce Department reported 39 percent, or 9,627, of its eligible employees engaged in telework in 2004.\nThe main reason for the still-sizeable gap between the number of eligible and actual teleworkers is the difficulty of providing adequate office coverage when large numbers of employees are working away from the office, officials said in their survey responses.\nFederal law requires agencies to participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without hurting employees' job performance.\nOPM reported a 95 percent survey response rate; 82 of 86 agencies that received the survey responded."}

His pairing with Hideki Matsuyama served as a Scarlet letter for an inauspicious start to the Hero World Challenge, his opening-round 73 the second-worst score of the day. At first glance, that figure mirrored his holiday performance against Phil Mickelson, where the soon-to-be 43-year-old trekked around Shadow Creek in a tryptophan-induced daze.\nIn truth, aside from an unseemly triple bogey\u2014as if a triple could be described in any other fashion\u2014Woods played alright on Thursday. He hit 12 of 13 fairways, 14 greens; simply undone by some shaky work on the greens (31 putts).\nBetter yet, Friday had all the makings of a fine bounce-back effort. Woods kept a clean card for 17 holes. Though his putter still wasn't talking to him, he kept the bogeys at bay. More importantly, he capitalized on the par 5s\u2014an Achilles' heel for Woods last season\u2014carding four birdies on the long holes, with a birdie at the par-4 14th for good measure.\nUnfortunately for Woods, that effort was undone at the last by a bizarre finish that featured a brush with the rule book.\nWoods sailed his drive at Albany's 18th in the native area, the ball coming to rest in the shrubs. On his knees, Woods was able to chop the ball out and into play. From there, Woods missed the green and failed to get up and down. The result was a double bogey, leaving Tiger with a three-under 69 for the round.\nHowever, that number came into question when replay appeared to show Woods hitting the ball twice. There was also a matter of whether Woods scooped the ball, also a violation. But after meeting with rules officials, Woods' 69 score held true, for a slightly strange reason.\n\"First of all, I didn't feel like I violated any rules. I felt like I was trying to play a shot. But the rules committee pulled me aside and said 'Hey, there may be a violation there' so we took a look at it,\" Woods told Golf Channel's Steve Sands. \"I didn't feel like I hit it twice, it happened so fast and it was such a short motion, but under high def and super slow-mo, you can see it. I made contact twice, but there was no, they'll explain it to you. There is no violation, I guess, so I shot what I shot today.\"\nWhile he escaped further penalty, the double dropped Woods, who at one point was as high as T-6 on the leader board, to a tie for 15th. He will begin Saturday eight shots behind the leaders.\nWoods noted, had he any semblance of a short game, he could have posted a nine-under score. \"I hit the ball close, close enough to really have a shot at a low number today, just didn't do it,\" Woods said. \"Just didn't hit the putts hard enough. Just the way it goes.\" While he ranks third in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation through two rounds, Tiger is last in putting.\nDespite the standing and finish, Woods seemed happy with his day.\n\"Today I played much better. I finally hit my irons the way I normally do,\" Woods said. \"Other than the last tee shot, I felt I"}

The missed extra points, while unfortunate, ultimately wouldn\u2019t matter, as the Chargers eeked out a 29-27 victory over the 49ers.\nBut that was no consolation for the kicker himself \u2013 or anyone else for that matter.

Desmond King was sure of it.\nHe\u2019d only become the Chargers punt returner a day earlier, as usual returner Travis Benjamin\u2019s foot injury continued to linger.

Most military gear, including helmets, boots and fatigues, have been compliant with the amendment for years.\nSome in Congress, concerned about limiting choices for recruits, didn't see the need to disrupt the status quo of the old policy of providing vouchers and letting them purchase sneakers of their choosing.\nBut the changes were adopted in 2017.

The order could be expanded to 248,000.\nThe other two companies are making athletic trainers for the first time.

San Antonio Shoe won a contract for up to 398,000 units that are being made in Texas.\nFor now, U.S. production of shoes \"is just a small, tiny drop in the bucket of what's needed to meet demand,\" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. But every little bit helps for a domestic industry that is only a shadow of what it once was.\nNationwide, shoe manufacturing has dropped over the last five decades, according to the U.S. Labor Department. The industry has undergone a complete reversal from the late 1960s when 98 percent of shoes were made in the United States. Now, about 98 percent of shoes are imported from other countries.\nIn Maine, brands like G.H. Bass, Cole Haan, Dexter and Sebago shuttered factories and moved production overseas to save money, leaving specialized workers unemployed and communities devastated.\nBut some U.S. shoemakers are finding ways to keep manufacturing in the United States.

Two members of the California Coastal Commission members then appealed the project.\nMembers Steve Kinsey and Mary Shallenberger said they are opposed to the project because it does not prohibit a seawall from being built in the future.\nIn addition, San Francisco attorney Thomas Roth filed an appeal on behalf of Friends of Oceano Dunes over San Luis Obispo Superior Court Judge Charles Crandall\u2019s ruling that the APCD has the authority to regulate off-road vehicle activity on the Oceano Dunes.\nFriends of Oceano Dunes argued that the APCD used flawed scientific practices and failed to prove that off-road vehicle activity on the dunes has caused an increase in pollution on the Nipomo Mesa. The dust rule requires the California Department of Parks to reduce the amount of particulate matter blowing from the Oceano Dunes to Nipomo Mesa or face fines of $1,000 a day.\nFriends of the Dunes, though not opposed to the project, has also voiced concerns that the relocation of a RV dump station will impact access to the dunes.\nThe project, currently expected to cost in the $30 million range, is slated to boost the economy in the struggling beach community through increased tax revenue and income from tourism.\nAnother (does sand end with a T) storm.\nI really don\u2019t understand why anyone would try to build anything around here.

The court's four liberal justices dissented.\nAccording to Justice Stephen Breyer, in the dissent, said Roberts' opinion undermined the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education. That 53-year-old case outlawed segregation in public schools.\nIn Massachusetts, legal advocates are reviewing whether the ruling affects the Metco program, which allows nearly 3,300 students to attend 190 suburban schools, said agency spokeswoman Catherine Tang.\nIt is also unclear whether the decision will impact 22 school district's use of state-approved plans to reduce racial imbalance inside their buildings, including Framingham, Waltham and Worcester.\nState education officials are studying how the decision affects local schools, said Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll, who added that any changes will be made \"thoughtfully.\"\n\"It does not, however, mean the end to educational equity,\" he said in a statement.\nU.S. Sen. John Kerry criticized the ruling, saying it threatened the Metco program.\n\"This decision has turned Brown vs. Board of Education's promise of fairness and opportunity for all upside down,\" Kerry said in a statement.\nHudson Superintendent Sheldon Berman - who starts his new job as head of the Jefferson County, Ky., schools next week - said the ruling should not change his future district's objectives.\nLouisville's schools spent 25 years under a court order to eliminate the effects of state-sponsored segregation. After a federal judge freed the Jefferson County, Ky., school board, which encompasses Louisville, from his supervision, the board decided to keep much of the court-ordered plan in place to prevent schools from re-segregating.\n\"In some degree it's disappointing,\" said Berman. \"I don't think it's going to be as impacting as it might seem.\"\nFramingham School Committee Chairman Philip Dinsky did not believe the ruling would affect the town's own school choice program.\n\"We've come to the conclusion that desegregation should be based on socio-economics, not race,\" said Dinsky, who had not seen a copy of the ruling.\nMore than a quarter of Framingham students qualify for low-income statutes, according to state education officials.\nAbout 32 percent of Framingham's roughly 8,000-member student body are ethnic minorities, according to the"}

The Schedule deals with the administration and control of tribal areas.\nThe submission was filed by Additional Solicitor General Fouzia Mirza after the HC sought the Centre\u0092s stand. However,the response contradicts earlier SC judgments on the issue.\nAttorney General G E Vahanvati had submitted earlier that the Governor\u0092s powers under the Fifth Schedule are \u0093discretionary\u0094.\nThe court is hearing a petition by Chhattisgarh-based activist B K Manish. He has argued that Tribal Advisory Rules,2006,formed under the Fifth Schedule by the state government violate the Constitution.\nHe said the Tribal Advisory Councils formed under the rules gave arbitrary powers to the chief minister whereas the Constitution mandates that the governor exercise his discretionary powers under the Fifth Schedule.\nThe Centre has rejected this contention. \u0093It cannot be said that these rules have been formulated in exercise of his discretionary powers. While framing these rules,the power of the governor has been exercised as the constitutional head of the State acting with the aid and advice of the council of ministers and not in his discretion,\u0094 ASJ Mirza stated.\nThe matter has been raised earlier before the courts.

Language springs from the life of the people who use it, evolving, influenced by their work, pastimes and surroundings. Fishing villages along the coast will have words that are not recognised by the farming community less than ten miles away. The mining dialect of Pitmatic came from words used by the men down the pit. It too uses words that will not be understood by the fishing villages - it's an ongoing easily observable example of how language grows and changes. It also demonstrates graphically the ties of language and place as Pitmatic is restricted to very specific areas of the Northumberland coast.\nRaymond Reid met Richard outside the last deep coal mine in Northumberland. Ellington extends six miles under the North sea and the geological problems that it created has led to it closure. Raymond reads one of his poems in dialect and tells us of life down the pit. He demonstrates how words were forged from the working life of the miners and uses one or two vivid examples of Pitmatic.\nKatrina Porteous lives in the village of Beadnell. Like all the fishing villages dotted up the coast, Beadnell relies as much on tourism as fishing. She uses the rich, almost visual sound of the language in her poetry and gives a good example of how sound and meaning are bound together. Katrina asks Richard to guess the meaning of a word just from its sound. Short, sharp words, for example, often have a quick, fleet meaning - words with more syllables slow down the sound of the word its meaning reflects a slower movement. Katrina tells Richard of the complexity of language, how it's used to bind communities together.\nAlan Wood has worked on the land all his life. He too is a dialect poet and takes Richard inland to the Coquet Valley. Known as the last wilderness in England, the Coquet Valley lies on the edge of the Cheviot hills. Alan tells tales of the people who have lived and worked in the valley, of his great-grandfather and the stories he handed down: of highwaymen and medieval burials all connected to the landscape."}

Pollara, 49, of Tamarac, Fla., had his bond increased to $200,000 from $125,000 by Judge Brian Telander, who said he deemed Pollara a flight risk. Should Pollara make bond, the judge ordered, he would be outfitted with an ankle monitor.\nThe judge's ruling came after Assistant State's Attorney Mike Fisher said it appeared that Pollara, who Florida police say stole $2 million in high-end Lego sets and other toys in 2012, traveled to the Chicago area this month with the intent to shoplift.\n\"If he's let go on bond, I think he'll flee the state of Illinois and go back to committing retail theft like he's been doing,\" Fisher told the judge.\nPollara told the judge that he would return to Illinois for future court dates and would be happy to wear a GPS tracking device to ensure compliance.\n\"Having an ankle monitor would be beautiful,\" Pollara told the judge. \"I could stay home and take care of my mother, who's in hospice.\"\nPollara served a year in jail for the toy thefts, which took place nationwide at Toys R Us stores, and he is on parole for that conviction. He had told his Florida parole officer that he would be traveling to Illinois to visit family, but the officer, knowing Pollara did not have relatives here, contacted local law enforcement, Fisher said.\nA Florida man who several years ago was charged with stealing $2 million worth of Lego sets has landed in the DuPage County Jail for allegedly stealing paint brushes.\nPolice, who were made aware of Pollara's airline flight schedule, were able to tail him in the Chicago area. He spent four nights in four different motels, each near a major shopping center, Fisher said. Police later placed a tracking device on Pollara's rental car, and a search of the vehicle turned up suspected stolen merchandise, the prosecutor said.\nHe was arrested July 3 after he was spotted trying to steal paintbrushes from the Hobby Lobby store on Roosevelt Road in Lombard. DuPage authorities charged him with felony burglary.\nFlorida authorities alleged Pollara financed lavish worldwide travel with proceeds from his shoplifting, and said in a police interview that one year he stole from stores in all 50 states. His habit of using a rewards card at Toys R Us eventually helped police track his string of thefts.\nHis mother, who police say acted as his lookout, was also charged in Florida and sentenced to probation."}

{"idx": "33146", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A federal judge temporarily blocked construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, ruling late Thursday that the Trump administration had failed to justify its decision granting a permit for the 1,200-mile long project designed to connect Canada\u2019s oil sands fields with Texas\u2019s Gulf Coast refineries.\nThe judge, Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court in Montana, said the State Department ignored crucial issues of climate change to further the president\u2019s goal of letting the pipeline be built. In doing so, the administration ran afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires \u201creasoned\u201d explanations for government decisions, particularly when they represent reversals of well-studied actions.\nIt was a major defeat for President Trump, who attacked the Obama administration for stopping the project in the face of protests and an environmental impact study. Trump signed an executive order two days into his presidency setting in motion a course reversal on the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as another major pipeline, Dakota Access.\nThe ruling highlights a broader legal vulnerability in the Trump administration\u2019s push to roll back Obama-era environmental protections. Since Trump took office, federal courts have found repeatedly that his agencies have short-circuited the regulatory process in areas ranging from water protections to chemical plant safety operations. Robust environmental and administrative procedure laws, many dating back to the 1970s, have given the administration\u2019s opponents plenty of legal ammunition.\nThursday\u2019s decision does not permanently block a federal permit for Keystone XL, a project of the Calgary-based firm TransCanada. It requires the administration to conduct a more complete review of potential adverse impacts related to climate change, cultural resources and endangered species. The court basically ordered a do-over.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes it clear once and for all that it\u2019s time for TransCanada to give up on their Keystone XL pipe dream,\u201d said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Doug Hayes in a statement. The lawsuit prompting Thursday\u2019s order was brought by a collection of opponents, including the indigenous Environmental Network and the Northern Plains Resource Council, a conservation coalition based in Montana.\n\u201cThe Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can\u2019t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,\u201d Hayes said.\nHayes told The Washington Post that the company had already been moving equipment into place in Montana and South Dakota with the intent of beginning construction in early 2019.\nMorris, a former clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama.\nHis decision was one of scores of court rebukes to the Trump administration for decisions on the environment, immigration and transgender service in the military, among other issues, all made hastily and, in the opinions of dozens of judges, without the \u201creasoned consideration\u201d required by federal law. Also on Thursday, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot immediately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation.\nThe administration is appealing many of these rulings, and may challenge Thursday\u2019s decision as well. The administration did not issue an immediate comment after the pipeline order.\nThe State Department has primary jurisdiction over the Keystone XL pipeline permit decision, by virtue of its authority to issue \u201cpresidential permits\u201d for cross-border infrastructure projects.\nThe massive project remains one of the most controversial infrastructure proposals in modern American history, with its proponents and critics dueling in court and on the streets for a decade."}
{"idx": "33147", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The world didn\u2019t need another streaming music service, but Apple Music came yesterday anyway. For the past day, I\u2019ve been using Apple Music to replace my standard Spotify usage \u2014 testing out Apple\u2019s discovery features, playlist building and listening to radio stations.\nMy first take after 24 hours: It\u2019s a great service, but it\u2019s not revolutionary like iTunes 99\u00a2 songs or the iPod. And it\u2019s probably not worth switching if you\u2019re happy with your current music streaming service.\nApple Music is currently available on iOS and through iTunes. An Android version is coming later this summer. Users can get three months free from the date they sign up. After the trial period, the service costs $9.99 per month, the same as similar premium streaming services like Spotify and Google Music.\nApple Music\u2019s catalog isn\u2019t too different from its competitors. It does have a few unique streaming options, including Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic and Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989, the latter of which was added after Swift called out the Cupertino company for not paying artists during the three-month trial period, and got Apple to change its habit. However, the streaming library doesn\u2019t include everything on the iTunes store. The Beatles are notably absent despite Apple\u2019s exclusive digital distribution deal.\nYou can add the streaming tunes to playlists and download them for offline listening, just like the premium tiers of many competitors. However, you can also easily integrate streaming songs with your existing iTunes library, so you can build playlists with streaming hits and more obscure songs you\u2019ve purchased elsewhere.\nApple Music also has Pandora-like radio stations that use algorithms to pick songs based on your ratings, as well as human-created playlists based on genres, musical influences and moods. The radio stations are the only free options for listening to Apple Music.\nThe 24-hour Beats 1 radio station is another nice addition to standard streaming media setup. With a rotating cast of DJs, it might seem that Apple is just copying terrestrial radio. However, the strange mix of hip hop, classic rock, indie folk and pretty much every other type of modern music, played for the world to hear, is entertaining to put on in the background. During the rollout of the radio station yesterday at 9 a.m., my tech media-heavy Twitter stream was full of people all jamming out to the same music.\nThe stream\u2019s mix can be jarring at times, playing Courtney Barnett\u2019s Pedestrian at Best and Vic Mensa\u2019s U Mad back-to-back this morning. But the banter from the DJs and the constant stream of new music is a nice way to get out of your musical rut and discover a new artist.\nThe best thing Apple Music has going for it, though, is the way it integrates with Apple hardware, something competitors will never be able to do if Apple keeps up its walled-garden approach. You can use Siri to start any song available for streaming, as well add songs to your playlists and switch to radio stations.\nFrom my experience, Apple Music also stays paused longer than Spotify. If I paused Spotify during lunch while I checked Facebook on my phone, my aging iPhone 5 would dump Spotify from the memory, meaning I had to restart the app to get music to play. With Apple Music, I haven\u2019t had to restart the app once, despite a long session of Alto\u2019s Adventures that would normally kill all my other apps running in the background.\nIt\u2019s nice using the Apple-blessed iTunes to listen to music"}

And although there are now over 250,000 apps for the platform (which MUST be enough, right?) it's still a long way off the million its bigger rivals boast.\nMind you, some apps like the excellent recent Flickpic which shares photos and more with the flick of a wrist and without wi-fi or pairing between phones, are appealing and enjoyable.\nWhat's more, this is the first phone to sport the latest edition of the operating software: Windows Phone 8.1.\nThe Nokia Lumia 630 comes in a choice of matte-finish colours which look great. Nokia has a history of making polycarbonate-cased phones look good, from its first Windows phone, the Nokia Lumia 700.\nHTC and more recently Apple are the only other manufacturers with such skills in plastic. There are bright green and orange finishes to choose from as well as a more demure black. The next phone, the Nokia Lumia 635 offers 4G, which this does not, and will be distinguished from this by having gloss instead of matte cases.\nThis is not a unibody phone. The coloured back pops off easily so you can insert a sim card and - hooray - a microSD memory card.\nIt feels light enough (it weighs 134g) and the curved shell fits the hand comfortably. The overall measurements are 129.5 x 66.7 x 9.2mm.Though it lacks the opulence of a sealed phone like the HTC One M8, it's an attractive handset.\nThe phone doesn't have the high-spec features of a premium handset - there's no heart rate monitor as there is on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and it's not waterproof like the Sony Xperia Z2. But it has the latest Windows Phone OS, which has some neat additions.\nYou can now have extra live tiles - the dynamic elements which update information on the fly and can be resized up to the width of the screen. Or you can now fit up to six across the display.\nWhen you have that many, the information displayed is minimal, just enough to identify whether it's email or camera, for instance. At larger sizes this also reveals how many mails are unread, say.\nVisually one of the disappointments of Windows Phone has been the fact that it wasn't possible to have wallpaper behind the tiles.

But that was precisely the reaction of Steve Smith, winemaker of Craggy Range Vineyards in New Zealand, when his Sauvignon Blanc was rated sixth out of six at a tasting this past Tuesday at Per Se restaurant in New York. The judges were some of the Big Apple\u2019s most persnickety wine writers, and yours truly representing DC. The last-place finish for his wine helped Smith prove a point.\nWhat is a great wine? One that wows you with its point score, aroma, fruit, complexity, and long finish, perhaps with some \u201cminerality\u201d thrown in? (Wine-geek alert: Tossing about the word \u201cminerality\u201d will earn you entr\u00e9e into all sorts of exclusive wine circles.) Or is a great wine one that complements your dinner, enhancing a flavor here and there, and rendering the whole of food-plus-wine greater than the sum of its parts?Perhaps more important, can those two wines be one and the same? Does a wine that wows by itself inherently pair well with food? One might think so\u2014if it\u2019s a great wine, it\u2019s a great wine. Right?\nWell, not necessarily, Smith would say. Smith is also a Master of Wine, which is not just someone with a PhD in oenogeekdom but more like a Nobel Prize winner. He argued that wine reviewers, geeks, writers, and judges tend to look for characteristics in a wine that don\u2019t necessarily make the wine food-friendly. Aggressive, intense fruit flavors, sappy ripeness, and soft acid can make a wine stand out in a suspect\u2019s lineup but maybe not at the dinner table. Smith prefers to look for \u201ctexture\u201d and \u201cbalance,\u201d two characteristics that can be hard to describe and, unless you\u2019re looking for them, easy to dismiss.\nHow did the wines fare with and without food? Well, the Craggy Range Te Muna Sauvignon Blanc 2006, which finished last in the initial tasting, was the group\u2019s favorite with food. (I rated it fifth and second, respectively.) By itself, I found the wine reticent in that it had virtually no aroma\u2014extraordinary for a New Zealand Savvy\u2014but just when I was prepared to dismiss it altogether, some appealing nectarine flavor emerged on the palate and finished rather strong. Smith described it as having a \u201ctalcum powder\u201d texture, something I chalked up to antipodean jet lag. My favorite wine from the initial tasting, the Kim Crawford 2006 Sauvignon Blanc, did not fare as well with food.\nThe Te Muna shined with a salad of sturgeon with horseradish cream and little pea-size balls of Granny Smith apples that played hide and seek with my fork. This was a dish that wreaked havoc on the other wines. The Te Muna also paired well\u2014as did all of the others\u2014with a dish of shaved fennel and butter-braised lobster knuckles.\nSo what were my takeaways from this tasting, other than the startling realization that lobsters have knuckles? My rankings differed widely from those of the group, suggesting that either New York wine writers are idiots or I\u2019m an idiot or reasonable palates may differ.

Certainly none so far as climate change is concerned. Whatever reduction in greenhouse gases may be achieved by destroying our land and seascapes will be offset many times more by the commissioning of new coal-fired power stations in China.\nAdd to this the fact that The John Muir Trust has stated that the Stronelairg development will be self-defeating since it will destroy peat land, which keeps carbon locked in the ground.\nA look at the map of Scotland showing existing and proposed wind farms makes a depressing sight.\nIf even a fraction of the outstanding applications are granted, it will be almost impossible to have a view which is not interrupted by a wind turbine, especially in the Southern Uplands/Borders.\nThere can only be one reason; money and lots of it, for relatively few people and certainly not the electricity consumer and taxpayer who are paying hefty sums to provide the subsidies which are the main incentive to build these blots on the land and seascapes.\nIN RESPECT of comments made, Ms Wait (Letters, 14 February) perhaps needs to look and hopefully absorb, the plethora of evidence now available for anyone to examine on mortality attached to wind turbines and avifauna, not only birds. They really are too numerous to list here.\nTo seriously suggest turbines as providing safe \u201cperching\u201d opportunities beggars belief and merely exposes a woeful ignorance of the subject.\nWe currently have a big problem with the lack of adequate and (most importantly) independent monitoring of the UK wind farms for wildlife fatalities.\nThat which is undertaken is often sporadic, developer-led, and nowhere near often enough.\nFrom overseas we have reports of deliberate burying of evidence. Whether that is happening here is clearly in the realms of guesswork.\nThe immediate areas in a radius below the turbine blades soon become known to \u201cNatures\u2019 sanitation squad\u201d and remains therefore become an unfortunately predictable/regular source of food.\nWe may only know the true scale of casualties from future surveys revealing impacts on populations of species at risk.\nAdded to this, if developers\u2019 environmental statements are examined, the number of projected golden eagle, and other protected species\u2019 fatalities are often clearly documented in applicable applications.\nThe number actually being killed are rising, and will rise as numbers of turbines increase.

For Bald Eagle Area School District, that would mean going from the $725,000 cut over the past four years to a $484,606 increase in just one year. It will also provide the district with an allocation of $4.8 million in property tax relief.\nWolf said he wants to revamp how education is funded, from being about local property taxes to relying more on state contributions. The governor\u2019s proposal would increase the state share of funding to 50 percent for the first time in 40 years.\n\u201cWe really need to invest in education,\u201d he said.\nCorman disagreed.

Previous investors IA Ventures and CrunchFund also participated, but Andreessen Horowitz is by far the largest investor in this round \u2014 and Peter Levine will join the board. Previously, the company went through Techstars Boulder and had raised $3.2 million.\nDigitalOcean provides scalable virtual private servers with a few key features to differentiate itself from its competitors. First, it\u2019s cheap. For $5 a month, you can run your virtual server (droplet) with 512MB of RAM, 20GB of SSD storage and 1TB of bandwidth \u2014 and you are billed per hour. It\u2019s great to run a small app and experiment. When asked whether the company will be able to maintain these prices, Uretsky\u2019s answer was straightforward. \u201cWe have no intention of changing our prices,\u201d he said.\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t run more serious services. Creating a droplet takes 55 seconds and you can resize it in a single click \u2014 there are many different droplet sizes. You can run multiple droplets. The company has multiple data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam and Singapore. It promises 99.99 percent uptime. In other words, DigitalOcean is all about providing low-level access to its users thanks to its virtual private server infrastructure. But you won\u2019t have to manage and upgrade dedicated servers in a collocation center.\nAnother example, Beyonc\u00e9 launched her new album in December. It turns out that Beyonce.com runs on DigitalOcean. The servers handled the album launch without breaking a sweat.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen 15 million visitors within the first 24 hours. She\u2019s been pretty happy with the service,\u201d Uretsky said.\nHow do we simplify web infrastructure so that it\u2019s easier for developers to use but is still powerful enough to build significant things with it?\nThe company competes with many hosting providers, such as Rackspace, Linode, and in some way Amazon EC2 and OpenStack hosts. But why do customers choose DigitalOcean over its competitors? The company has some powerful community features. Customers can share tutorials and tips to run a particular stack or application. The website now has a large ever-expanding knowledge base. Developers can also ask for help if they are stuck.\nSimilarly, the company tries to make using the service as simple as possible. You still have to learn system administration skills, but it\u2019s a bit easier than managing your own physical server. Setting up a droplet takes a few clicks. You also get a web console access. Soon, users will be able to share and use templates thanks to a new provisioning tool. The company is also working on IPv6, load balancing and eventually storage.\n\u201cAfter raising, we can switch our focus back to why we made this business in the first place. How do we simplify web infrastructure so that it\u2019s easier for developers to use but is still powerful enough to build significant things with it?\u201d Uretsky said.\nWith today\u2019s funding, the company will hire more people to face great scalability challenges. The company\u2019s growth started around a year ago. At the beginning of 2013, it only had a couple of thousands of customers. It now has 110,000 active customers, runs 5,000 physical servers and signs up a bit less than a thousand users every day. And it\u2019s profitable.\n"}

But Romand was actually leading a double life: He had never graduated from medical school, hadn't held a job in two decades, and was living off the savings he'd bilked from his parents, his in-laws, and his mistress. On the verge of being found out, he killed his wife, his two children, and his parents, then burned his house to the ground, rather than simply confessing the truth. Many filmmakers would have heightened the tabloid horrors of this story, but Cantet removes them entirely, focusing on an ordinary guy so overcome with feelings of shame and inadequacy after losing his job that he chooses to bury himself in an avalanche of lies. Beautifully played by Aur\u00e9lien Recoing, who looks uncannily like middle-management material, Cantet's protagonist isn't a scoundrel or a killer, but a man whose entire sense of identity and worth is bound tragically to the workplace. In many ways, Recoing mirrors William H. Macy's character in Fargo, another low-level suit who hatches an impossible scheme and scrambles desperately to keep it afloat. Both films derive extraordinary tension and dread from the inevitable moment when their protagonists' plans fall to pieces, but Time Out burns more slowly and methodically, achieving its effects through a greater fidelity to the everyday. Cantet follows the rough outlines of Romand's story\u2014the nature of his deception, his commute from northern France to Geneva, his survival on other people's savings\u2014but changes the details to bring it down to earth. Three months after getting fired from a post he'd held for 11 years, Recoing is still traveling on \"business trips,\" driving aimlessly to get away from his family and sleeping in parking lots on the passenger side of his car. To buy himself time, he claims to have a job with the U.N. in Geneva, and he scams his former business associates into phony investments in emerging markets around the world. For extra cash, he gets mixed up with a crooked bootlegger (Serge Livrozet) who smuggles knock-off merchandise from Eastern Europe. Recoing can only go so long before his wife (Karen Viard) and investors begin asking questions, yet it's remarkable how patiently Cantet raises the stakes until he reaches the breaking point. Aside from Recoing's outrageous deception and denial, Time Out could be the sad story of any businessman who loses his job and stares down the resulting humiliation, insecurity, and despair. By pruning the sensational aspects of Romand's story, Cantet makes his hero's psychosis all too recognizable."}

(NASDAQ:CBMG) (\"CBMG\" or the \"Company\"), a biomedicine firm engaged in the development of effective stem cell therapies for degenerative diseases and immunotherapies for cancer, today announced results from an expanded Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety, feasibility and anti-tumor activity of its Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T-Cells (CAR-T) immunotherapy (CBM-EGFR.1) targeting wild type EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumors. Based on the results from 24 patients treated with CBM-EGFR.1 (17 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 5 patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 1 patient with pancreatic cancer and 1 patient with renal cell carcinoma (RCC)), the early results showed that CBM-EGFR.1 immunotherapy was safe, well tolerated, and had positive signal of clinical activity in several indications. The data was selected for a late-breaking oral presentation entitled EGFR-Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cells Immunotherapy for Patients With EGFR-Expressing Advanced or Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors at the 5th World Congress on Cancer Therapy in Atlanta, Georgia on September 28, 2015.

The trial enrolled 24 EGFR positive (defined as at least 50% membrane staining of EGFR based on immunohistochemistry), advanced, relapsed/refractory patients with NSCLC, cholangiocarcinoma, RCC or pancreatic cancer. Most of the NSCLC patients failed EGFR-TKI therapy prior to CBM-EGFR.1 treatment. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment, and received dose escalating infusions of CBM-EGFR.1 cells with or without conditioning chemotherapy. Autologous CBM-EGFR.1 cells were generated from 50 to 80 ml peripheral blood after a 10 to 12-day in vitro expansion, and the total CAR-expressing T cell number of 1\u00d7106/kg was set as an output control.

The bad part is that there is more [trash and plastic] than what we thought. But the good part is that most of the plastic is still large object. Just 8 percent of the plastic is microplastic.

The crisis clearly entered a new phase with the regime's implicit threat to use chemical weapons in the event of an intervention, a threat the United States, Israel, the Arab League, Russia and the European Union have all denounced.\nThe regime now appears to be using both attack helicopters and fixed wing aircraft in its struggle to push the rebels back from the key cities of Damascus and Aleppo. Meanwhile, reports indicate al Qaeda fighters are streaming into the country. Assad may be on his last legs, or he may hold on. In either case, the trajectory is toward a nasty civil war fought outright or by proxy among all of Syria's neighbors.\nIf ever there was a moment when intervention seemed likely, we have reached it. The strategic and humanitarian rationales are greater, perhaps even than they were 15 months ago in Libya, when NATO chose to carry out an air campaign to help rebel forces oust Qaddafi.\nBut this does not mean it will happen.\nOne of the key lessons of last year's intervention in Libya was that the international community acted when three conditions held: there was strong regional support, legal sanction from the UN Security Council, and a military strategy that promised to have a positive impact on the ground. Obama administration officials have repeated these criteria since.\nIn Libya, the United States rightly resisted pressure for a no-fly zone in the early weeks of the revolt on the grounds that it would have almost no impact on Qaddafi's efforts to snuff out the revolution. Only when a civilian protection mission that allowed for much stronger air-ground campaign against the regime became possible did NATO take action.\nDespite the pressure to do something, a realistic military option with a prospect of having a significant positive impact on the crisis has yet to emerge with Syria. Options involving small special operations teams might address the threat of chemical weapons proliferation to Hezbollah, as well as the growing presence of al Qaeda. But to deal with the looming possibility of all-out civil war and ethnic cleansing, the small footprint used in Libya is unlikely to be enough. It might help the rebels defeat Assad. But it would do little to deal with the chaos that is likely to emerge after he is gone.\nChristopher S.

That is the finding of ac a study published January 16th 2015 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\nA release from the American College of Cardiology reports that patients who survived sudden cardiac arrest or had a near-fatal fast heart rhythm, called an arrhythmia, are sometimes treated with an ICD to prevent future cardiac arrest. An ICD is placed under the skin and connected to the heart with wires. The device detects when the heartbeat is irregular and can return the heart rhythm to normal with an electrical shock \u2014 also known as defibrillation.\nMasoudi said the findings suggest that physicians are doing a good job of selecting elderly patients for the implantable defibrillators.\nPast randomized clinical trials of ICDs were relatively small, were conducted several decades ago and did not include many older patients. ICD technology and treatment for underlying heart disease have since improved, Masoudi said. In an analysis of these clinical trials, the risk of death for patients at least 75 years of age was approximately 35 percent among those receiving an ICD, compared with 22 percent in the current study, in which 75 percent of the population was at least 75 years old.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to study older patients, because they often have other co-existing medical conditions, which may have an impact on their outcomes,\u201d Masoudi said.\nUsing data from NCDR\u2019s ICD Registry, the study included 12,420 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing an ICD implantation after surviving sudden cardiac arrest or a near-fatal ventricular arrhythmia, between 2006 and 2009 in almost 1,000 U.S. hospitals.\nThe researchers found 65.4 percent of patients were hospitalized during the two years after receiving an ICD, ranging from 60.5 percent in those less than age 70 to 71.5 percent in those 80 and older. In addition, 13.1 percent among those less than 70 years old and 21.9 percent of those 80 and older were admitted to a skilled nursing facility. The risk of admission to a skilled nursing facility was greatest in the first 30 days after the procedure. The risks of hospitalization and admission to skilled nursing facility were all greater with increasing patient age.\nThe researchers noted that the high hospitalization and skilled nursing facility admission rates, particularly among the oldest patients, indicate there are substantial care needs after an ICD is implanted.\n\u201cThis gives us a good picture of the health care needs of this population after their procedure,\u201d Masoudi said.\nLimitations include that the study was not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ICDs and did not compare the patients receiving the devices with a control group who did not receive them.\nHe said that until more research is done about the devices in elderly patients, doctors should consider non-heart-related co-occurring medical conditions and frailty along with age in their decision-making process about ICDs. They should provide the patient with a clear understanding of the rationale and limitations of the ICD, encourage advance directives and bring up the possibility of deactivating the ICD if the patient is nearing end of life."}

Like many Puritan clergymen, Wigglesworth kept a diary for recording his daily life, meditations on faith, and his battles with lust and temptation. For Wigglesworth, however, these feelings took a form that seemed dangerous to record even in his private papers.\nWigglesworth was plagued by his attraction to his male students, many of whom were his close contemporaries in age. The passages in his diary about these attractions are written in a secret code, allowing him to be explicit about his feelings and his fears.\nOn April 5, 1653, Wigglesworth wrote, \"I find my spirit so exceedingly carried with love, that I can't tell how to take up my rest in God.\" On July 4, 1653, he struggled with \"filthy lust\" inspired by \"my fond affection for my students while in their presence.\" Wigglesworth married in 1655, but his attraction to men continued. The day after his marriage Wigglesworth confessed to his diary: \"I feel stirrings and strongly of my former distemper even after the use of marriage --which makes me exceeding afraid.\" In 1656, Wigglesworth became minister of the church in Malden, Massachusetts.\nIn 1662, Wigglesworth published an epic poem about the Last Judgment called The Day of Doom. The first 1800 copies sold out within a year, and the poem quickly became the most widely-read and frequently-memorized text of the age. Exerpts from the poem are often used in modern college courses to illustrate the grim and fiery tone of New England Puritanism in the 1600s. Wigglesworth's private torment, however, is seldom, if ever, mentioned in considerations of his work. Knowing Wigglesworth's private fears gives added resonance and pathos to the descriptions of the eternal torment of damnation in his writing.\nWhose flaming eyes hid things doth spy, and darkest things reveal.\"\nTo fearful blame and endless shame are there most justly brought.\"\nNo matter what Wigglesworth did to conceal his desires from his contemporaries, he felt sure that the truth would out, and damn him forever, when it really mattered.\nWigglesworth's carefully encoded confessions were not revealed until the 1960s, when historian Edmund Morgan decoded the passages and published a full version of the diary. Wigglesworth seems to have taken his secret with him to the grave. However, a passing comment made by another minister upon his death reveals how important his decision to encode his thoughts had been. When Wigglesworth died in 1705, the son of one of his former students--the renowned minister Cotton Mather--preached the sermon at his funeral. In the published edition of the funeral sermon, Mather wrote that he could attest to Wigglesworth's great love and concern for his students, since he had read about it in the teacher's \"reserved papers.\""}

Competition for a spot in that most sought-after of all Oscar categories seems more potent than usual at this point, with such films as \"Lions for Lambs\" and \"No Country for Old Men\" already showing the kind of muscle and response that ultimately earns Academy Award attention -- but none more so than the Lumet dazzler. \"Devil\" grabs you from the opening scene (which happens to involve Hoffman behaving as unlike Truman Capote as one could ever imagine) to the final fade, never losing momentum for a moment. Watching it is, in fact, like being trapped in an out-of-control locomotive. If it's not Lumet's best film, \"Devil\" certainly is right up there with such Lumet knockouts as \"12 Angry Men,\" \"The Pawnbroker,\" \"Serpico,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" \"Network\" and \"The Verdict.\" In the acting department, Hawke and Hoffman are superb as ill-fated brothers who find themselves at the center of a disaster of their own making; Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris also are first-rate as their parents who discover -- too late -- that they should have practiced birth control. Don't let anyone ruin this one for you by spilling too much of the plot; the continual surprises are among the film's many virtues. ... On Thursday, the theater-scene attention goes back to Broadway with -- at long last and with its hefty ticket price -- Mel Brooks' musicalized \"Young Frankenstein\" making its official debut at the Hilton on West 42nd; that same night, the newly discovered play written in 1898 by Mark Twain and adapted by David Ives titled \"Is He Dead?\" begins prevuing at the Lyceum, starring Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (for \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\"). Michael Blakemore directs. ... Friday signals the start of the second annual Broadway visit of \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" this year at the St. James for nine weeks with Patrick Page as the Grinch. ...

That's why, for many philanthropic high-net-worth individuals, the significant financial benefits of establishing a private foundation might be especially compelling right now, says Foundation Source, the nation's largest provider of support services for private foundations.\nFor more information about the tax benefits of creating a private foundation, view this Foundation Source article.\n\"Suppose an individual has highly appreciated stock that he or she can't sell because of the capital gains implications or an under-diversified portfolio that's doing little for him or her,\" said Jeffrey Haskell, chief legal officer of Foundation Source. \"If this individual establishes a private foundation, he or she can donate those appreciated and unproductive assets to it, sell them in a tax-advantaged environment, and reinvest the proceeds for a higher return. The subsequent investment earnings can then be used to make grants to charities.\"\nReduce or eliminate potential estate taxes.\nOne of the immediate benefits for contributing cash to a private foundation is an income tax deduction of up to 30 percent of the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI). The donor receives a tax deduction up front and can make charitable deductions over time, enabling him or her to give strategically instead of in the usual year-end rush.\nA donor may also be able to avoid paying capital gains taxes by donating highly appreciated assets to his or her private foundation. For example, if a donor were to give appreciated stock held over a year to the foundation, the donor would be entitled to receive an income tax deduction for the full, fair-market value of the stock. If the foundation sells the stock in the future, it will pay only the nominal excise tax of one or two percent on the net capital gains.\nBecause the assets a donor contributes to his or her private foundation are able to grow in a tax-advantaged environment, over the years the foundation's value will likely exceed the total amount of the donor's contributions \u2013 even though the donor will be making regular charitable grants. The result will be a significant charitable legacy that the donor's heirs may continue to control and pass to future generations in perpetuity.\nAssets that are contributed to a private foundation are excluded from the donor's estate. As a result, they are not subject to federal or state estate taxes. For high-net-worth individuals who have a strong charitable interest, private foundations offer an opportunity to avoid paying estate taxes while simultaneously creating an enduring philanthropic legacy.\nFor more information on the tax benefits of private foundations, visit here.\nFor more information on starting a private foundation, visit Foundation Source."}

That was the consensus of historians then, and it remains the consensus now.\nThe historical fact of genocide has been well established by those who are responsible for making such judgments. For the time being, we should be content to leave the genocide issue in the hands of the historians.\nIn my mind, it is counterproductive to bring this issue to the fore to embarrass Turkey at a time when our relations with that country are exceedingly delicate. Right now, Turkey is important for two of our nation's major foreign policy objectives \u2014 making progress toward peace in the Middle East and blocking Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Cooperation from Turkey is sorely needed for achieving both these objectives.\nI am writing regarding the article on June 22 that detailed the firing of Toll Middle School teacher Jennifer Pakradouni (\"Teacher sues district principal,\" June 22).\nThis action was, and is, shocking and appalling! I've been a teacher at Toll Middle School for 22 years and have taught with many, many excellent, exemplary teachers. Pakradouni is one of these, and one of the best! She is intelligent, enthusiastic, energetic, creative and beloved by parents, students and teachers alike.\nThis is exemplified by the fact that she was voted \"Toll Teacher of the Year\" this year. The firing of a teacher like Jennifer is indeed a tragedy for Toll. As I have already stated, it is shocking and appalling!\nWhat is also a tragedy, not only for Toll, but for the entire Glendale Unified School District, is the change in attitude and atmosphere within the district, from the top down. I have been a part of the district since 1971, when my children began their schooling at Mark Keppel. I was a PTA mom at Keppel, Toll and Hoover for years, and then became a teacher at Toll in 1988.\nThrough the years, I've had close friends on the Glendale Unified school board, and enjoyed a warm relationship with district officials. All of the above were supportive, appreciative and affirming of me and the other Toll teachers, often stopping by our classrooms to extend their thankfulness for our hard and successful work. That was then; this is now.\nIn these last years since Michael Escalante has been superintendent, the atmosphere within our district has changed. The attitude, from Escalante and some school board members, now seems to be: \"Everything is the teachers' fault; they aren't working hard enough; let's look for what they are doing wrong.\"\nThis attitude is incorrect and unproductive, and has led to great injustices, such"}

Bevington (1975); MED: Middle English Dictionary; S: N-Town Play, ed. Spector (1991); s.n.: stage name.\nAll English dramatic versions of the creation story are based upon Genesis 1. The N-Town Creation of Heaven and the Fall of Lucifer Play corresponds most closely to Chester\u2019s Play 1 that recounts the creation of the heavens and Lucifer\u2019s fall. Quite differently, Towneley addresses the creation of the heavens, earth, Adam and Eve and the fall in one long play. And York, possibly due to its abundance of active guilds, portrays the fall of the angels in one play (Play 1), but the other creation and fall subjects are played in five other short plays (Plays 2\u20136). Spector notes that the N-Town Play \u201cincludes on the first day the extra-biblical creation of the angels. Jubilee 2:2 also allocates that event to the first day, and Augustine asserts in De Civitate Dei that the angels were themselves the light that was called \u2018day\u2019\" (S 2:418).\nThe play is written entirely in thirteener stanzas.\nBefore 1 Ego sum alpha et oo, principium et finis.

Line 1\u2019s \u201cMy name is knowyn\" implies the theological point that all Creation is figured in the name of God and is preceded by his knowing, as if to announce that God\u2019s idea precedes Creation, which flows from it.

Yet worker-owned cooperatives are still a tiny share of the market of gig economy companies\u2013both in the home cleaning sector (Up & Go has just around 40 workers), and across all other industries.\nBut as companies like Uber and Handy have fallen under scrutiny for toxic corporate culture and worker mistreatment (in 2015, a Handy worker sued the company, claiming she made only $14 for 30 hours of work), a space has opened up for more serious consideration of worker-owned platforms.\nPlatform cooperativism is a concept that Trebor Scholz, an author and New School professor, and a number of other researchers and advocates have been extolling for years as an ethical alternative to the gig economy. Instead of Uber and Lyft, for example, a worker-owned rideshare co-op could ferry people around cities (places like Austin, London , nd Denver are already experimenting with this model), and cooperative platforms like Up & Go could eventually scale to replace Handy and Taskrabbit.\nA digital platform is an online or app-based space and business model in which consumers (users) and producers (owners) interact. On the social platform Facebook, for instance, users interact with each other by liking and posting things, while producers collect data on those consumer habits and use it to sell advertising. On on-demand platforms like Handy, some users hire other users to clean their homes, and the producers take a cut of that interaction to pay themselves. As we\u2019ve learned over the years, this digital platform model often creates vulnerabilities for users\u2013especially those like Uber drivers and Handy workers, who perform labor for other users but also under the umbrella of the larger producer company, without gaining \u201cemployee\u201d status.\nAdvocates like Scholz see platform coops\u2013in which users ultimately own and control the platforms\u2013as a viable and more equitable alternative to the extractive model we\u2019re currently see scale. To that end, Scholz\u2019s organization, the Platform Cooperative Consortium at The New School, is debuting a Platform Co-op Development Kit"}

The tower features images reflective of the community, including silhouettes of Veterans Memorial Bridge and the Hopperstad Stave Church.\nSu Legatt, the project's facilitator, wanted to create a water tower that displayed the identity of the town and served as a welcoming beacon when coming into Moorhead.\n\"I think the design of this tower is pretty reflective of the Woodlawn neighborhood,\" she said. \"We had open houses and community surveys, members of the community were even on the design team. This is just one more example of how the city is trying to work with its citizens to incorporate public art throughout the community.\"\nStephen Dorsey, one of the two water tower artists along with Jack Lunde, remembers seeing the plain Woodlawn water tower growing up in Moorhead. Years later, he never imagined he'd be the one responsible for transforming the blank canvas into a work of art.\n\"Doing a water tower design was never on my radar. So to see this on my hometown water tower, on this scale and this height is amazing,\" he said. \"To think of how many people will see this during the 20-25 years it's up is awesome.\"\nThe water tower artwork cost $26,000 and took 10 weeks to complete. MPS budgeted $20,000 for the artwork, which is how much it would've cost to get just the Moorhead letters around the tower, said Marc Pritchard, MPS water plant supervisor. Every 20 years, Moorhead Public Service repaints the towers as part of a maintenance plan.\nA design within the initial budget was created, but Moorhead City Council and MPS voted to approve the overage for the more expensive design and split the leftover costs, he said.\n\"The water tower turned out really well. Anytime you can make something aesthetically pleasing like this, it's always a benefit for everybody,\" Pritchard said.\nIn addition to the Woodlawn water tower and Oakport tower, which got its artistic remodel in the summer of 2017, Moorhead Public Service will have the opportunity to approve two more towers that could display artwork, Legatt said. A new water tower will be built in south Moorhead in the summer of 2019, and the Interstate 94 water tower will begin its maintenance in the summer of 2020."}

Care has been taken to ensure that the reading level is suitable for the trained chemist or physicist.The encyclopedia is divided in three major sections. The first section, Fundamentals, covers - the mechanics of atoms and molecules and their interactions, the macroscopic and statistical description of systems at equilibrium, and the basic ways of treating reacting systems. The contributions in this section assume a somewhat less sophisticated audience than the two subsequent sections. At least a portion of each article inevitably covers material that might also be found in a modern, undergraduate physical chemistry text. The second section, Methods, provides the instrumentation and fundamental theory employed in the major spectroscopic techniques, the experimental means for characterizing materials, the instrumentation and basic theory employed in the study of chemical kinetics, and the computational techniques used to predict the static and dynamic properties of materials.The last section, Applications, offers specific topics of current interest and intensive research. For the practicing physicist or chemist, this encyclopedia is the place to start when confronted with a new problem or when the techniques of an unfamiliar area might be exploited. For a graduate student in chemistry or physics, the encyclopedia gives a synopsis of the basics and an overview of the range of activities in which physical principles are applied to chemical problems.

And hence, I think, the brevity and obscurity of the debate: It did not have popular traction enough to sustain any attention with our laudably public-minded local media.\nReally, though, the assertion that ought to have provoked shock was not that Orange County's 34 polities might unite into a single city, but that Orange County might come to possess anything deserving of that term at all. Surely not one of its squabbling, petty suburbs really comes close; however, the state of California, with its duly issued charters of incorporation, might beg to differ.\nNo, the word \"city\" deserves far better than the likes of Irvine, Santa Ana or Anaheim among its rolls. A city is a thing of majesty. It calls upon such storied names as Athens, Rome, Carthage and Alexandria; Baghdad and Constantinople; London and Paris and New York; Tokyo and Shanghai.\nSave their sizes and their histories. Stow away even their power and their prestige. These are places of consequence because they are, by their very nature, places of cultural commerce.

The new research has pinpointed when some of the first European art that we know of was created.\nAccording to the scientists, the earliest cave paintings in Spain (from three different sites) date back more than 64,000 years. These paintings are red and black in color and depict geometric shapes, hand-prints, hand stencils, and even animals like horses, deer, and birds.\nThe paintings were dated using a technique called uranium-thorium dating, which is far more precise for estimating the dates of such creations than the radiocarbon-dating method that was used in the past.\n\"This is an incredibly exciting discovery which suggests Neanderthals were much more sophisticated than is popularly believed,\" archaeologist Chris Standish of the University of Southampton, one of the two lead authors on the paper, said in a news release.\nIn the other new study, researchers used the same technique to reveal that Neanderthals may have engaged in creative or symbolic behavior long before these cave paintings were created. In the Cueva de los Aviones, in what is now southeast Spain, a collection of shells appears to be decorated with pigment and perforated in ways that might have allowed them to be worn in a decorative fashion.\nIf these shells were intentionally modified in such a way, it would indicate Neanderthals were engaging in complex symbolic behavior potentially at least as far back as Homo sapiens ever did.\nPerforated shells found in sediments in Cueva de los Aviones and date to between 115,000 and 120,000 years.\nChanging what it means to be a \"Neanderthal\"\nHomo sapiens first evolved approximately 200,000 years ago.

Bush. Also targeted for a drastic reduction is a low-interest loan fund that helps local governments upgrade aging sewage treatment systems.\nThe rollbacks are part of a broader spending bill that would implement the second year of \"sequestration\" cuts required after Congress failed to agree on a budget. The House Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee sent the measure to the full Appropriations Committee.\nIt's one of 12 bills under consideration to fund day-to-day operations of government agencies. It could be revised substantially during negotiations this fall and likely would face a veto threat from Obama even if it cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nStill, the proposed reduction is by far the deepest yet sought for the restoration initiative, and groups that have championed the program said they were alarmed.\n\"Cuts of this magnitude would bring Great Lakes programs to a halt,\" said Joel Brammeier, president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes. Even during a time of belt tightening, he said, \"what's mystifying to me is these programs seem to be singled out for disproportionate treatment.\"\nAfter an initial $475 million in 2009, the restoration initiative has gotten about $300 million a year, although this year's total has fallen to $285 million because of across-the-board cuts. The subcommittee bill would slash the 2014 allocation to just $60 million.\nThe Great Lakes region historically has received about one-third of the money in the federal loan fund for sewer repairs. Sewer overflows cause local officials to order beach closings each year because of E. coli bacteria contamination. The bill would reduce the fund from just over $1 billion this year to $250 million in 2014.\n\"When we first saw these numbers, I could only surmise that perhaps somebody had miscounted and thought there was only one Great Lake,\" said Todd Ambs, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition.\nIronically, the subcommittee's action came the same day that a bipartisan group of House members introduced legislation that would reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Environmental Protection Agency office that oversees Great Lakes programming.\n\"The Great Lakes is one of the jewels of the United States and it's imperative we protect it for its environmental significance but also because of its economic might,\" Rep.

Third-party integrations have been a critical aspect of Slack's success in recent years, and Workplace is designed to compete directly with Slack.\nIn opening up Workplace to third-party integrations, Facebook shows that it's cognizant of what enterprise customers value and taking Workplace very seriously. A minor distinction is that Slack's approach is to make a user-friendly and approachable way to add integrations, while Facebook's is designed to be implemented by the corporate IT team, giving the enterprise greater control over how employees interact with the software.\nMore broadly, Workplace is Facebook's most serious attempt yet at targeting the enterprise. There's far more money in the enterprise market, and Facebook is also expanding distribution and working with reseller channels. Workplace has tremendous potential to open up entirely new and incrementally additive revenue streams for Facebook, even at its aggressive pricing levels that meaningfully undercut Slack.

Another raw materials gauge, the S&P GSCI Index, has rallied over 5 per cent this week to levels last seen in 2014.\nThe gains are being driven by crude, which is set for its best weekly jump since July, and aluminum, poised for its strongest rally since 1987. Oil investors are rattled by the potential for Middle East supply disruptions in the wake of the U.S. threatening to bomb Russian ally Syria, Saudi Arabia shooting down missiles fired by rebels in Yemen, and rising concern that America would reimpose sanctions on Iran and curb its exports.\nIn the aluminum market, U.S. sanctions on Russian producer United Co.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures are up 8.6 per cent on the week at US$67.38 a barrel in New York as the escalating tensions have taken investor focus away from concern that an American crude boom will undermine OPEC\u2019s output curbs to clear a global glut.\nThe missiles fired at Saudi Arabia by pro-Iranian Houthi rebels in Yemen and the prospect of U.S. retaliation against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 whose forces are backed by both Russia and Iran \u2014 for a suspected chemical weapons attack raises the risk of supply disruptions, Goldman said.\nThere\u2019s also increasing concern whether the U.S. will pull out of a deal between Iran and global powers that eased sanctions on the OPEC nation in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor and Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, both vocal Iran hawks, has significantly increased the odds of sanctions being reintroduced by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Goldman said.\nIf that happens, European refiners may cut imports from Iran, given their exposure to the U.S., either through assets or product trade flows, according to the bank. \u201cThe EU accounts for 25 per cent of Iran\u2019s 2.6 million barrel-a-day crude exports but we believe the key for the global oil market is whether these flows will be curtailed rather than simply redirected to Asia,\u201d the analysts wrote.\nIn the aluminum market, all parts of the supply chain are rushing to assess the risks of handling metal from Rusal, a company that Goldman said represents 6 per cent of global output."}

It's hard to imagine crouching down to take a picture at any of those landmarks and suddenly having a cyclist whiz by within inches of your backside, shouting at you for stepping over a painted line.\nThe city has been exploring solutions. A 2017 Department of Transportation report suggested widening the promenade, but a $370,000 feasibility study is just getting underway. Funding the project is another question, given that bridge work is notoriously \"costly and complicated,\" as DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg has noted.

Like other iconic New York destinations, including Central Park, Times Square, the High Line and the 9/11 Memorial, the bridge promenade should have a nonprofit manager.\nIt is a mystery why the bridge has no conservancy, no historical society and no foundation.

The bad news is that anything you do short of remodeling may provide only modest relief.\nThe most cost-effective way to deal with noisy pipes is to insulate them. Water pipes that are accessible should be wrapped with the appropriate-size neoprene rigid insulation. Accessible soil pipes should be wrapped with a minimum of 1-inch-thick fiberglass insulation.\nIn either case the insulation should be secured with duct tape.

Davie used the word, \u201ctweak,\u201d to describe the change, but it has turned out to be a complete makeover with more run-option-plays from Magee\u2019s spread offense that he learned from Rich Rodriguez at West Virginia, Michigan and Arizona.\nDavie, however, was disappointed with the defense.\n\u201cDefensively, boy, it was a tough night,\u201d Davie said. \u201cI give (Incarnate Word) credit, they are talented.\nDavie said he never wanted his choice for the starting quarterback to be dramatic. He said the competition was close, but also talked about Tuioti\u2019s potential to become a special football player for the Lobos.\nThe touchdown to Lilly displayed that special quality and knack for the big play that Tuioti possesses. However, assuredly he\u2019ll be heavily tested at Madison next week when the Lobos take on No. 4 Wisconsin.\nFor now, the Lobos got their much-needed win. This is the momentum that Davie had always wanted, a victory needed after seven straight losses to end last season.\nThe Lobos were heavily favored to beat the FCS program with a first-year coach, Eric Morris.\nStill, UNM showed up as a different team from those of years past under Davie, who is in his seventh season.\nThe Lobos were aggressive and made big plays in their passing game with Tuioti leading the way. They were efficient. They scored on their first four possessions.\nIncarnate Word made a bit of a surprise start with its quarterback, going with true freshman Jon Copeland.\nHe was impressive, particularly in the opening drive when the Cardinals scored on their first possession to grab a 7-0 lead.\nThe Lobos needed to answer, and they did. Davie said tight ends would be more involved in the offense this season. He wasn\u2019t lying.\nMarcus Williams caught the first of his two touchdowns on a 10"}

{"idx": "33234", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the third of our \u201cMeet the Skylanders \u201d posts, we look at the final Earth element character, Dino Rang, and break the seal on the Fire element with Ignitor.\nDino-rang: Another character available in both Single and Triple packs. However he is considerably rarer than other Earth element characters because he wasn\u2019t released until the second wave of figures in December 2011.\nOf the second wave figures he was also unique in completing an element set and offering a boost to their Magic stat. All this combines with his close range projectile attacks to make Dino-rang a much sought after character ($30 Amazon).\nDino-rang was the first of the second wave figures that I purchased, and it was because he could complete my Earth Skylanders line up that attracted me to him most. He soon became a strong favorite in our family. The kids got on well with him as he is the fastest character in the group, and also has the highest armor.\nOut of the gate he also has an excellent medium range boomerang attack that can be cheaply upgraded (Basalt Boomerangs). Like the other Earth Skylanders , you have a choice whether you want to develop Dino-rang in an attacking (via the Grand Boomerang Master path) or defensive (via Earthen Avenger path) direction.\nIgnitor joins Dark Spyro, Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy as a starter pack figure that you cannot currently buy in a single pack (the exception to the rule here is Stealth Elf). This combines with the fact that Ignitor is only found in the 3DS pack to make him one of the harder Skylanders to acquire.\nThe figure itself is one of the most classically Dungeons and Dragons looking in the Skylanders collection. He holds a flaming sword and is clad in impressive armor. It is this, along with some of the most imaginative and visually impressive attacks that has made Ignitor more expensive than his Starter pack colleagues.\nThis desirability has led to some retailers splitting the 3DS packs and selling Ignitor separately. Even so this can still price him out of the pocket money range (currently $40 on Amazon) of my kids, which is a shame for such a great figure.\nIgnitor starts off with two basic flame attacks, one via his sword and one via his flame throwing mouth. Although these offer a good starting point, he doesn\u2019t really come into his own until you hit the later upgrades. Here you have a choice, either develop his defensive flame abilities (via Soul of the Flame path) or opt for the offensive blade skills (via the Blademaster path).\nI had intended to work through the various sword abilities, but was beaten to the punch by my son who preferred the less attacking flame form skills. This proved to be a good idea though and Ignitor soon became a favorite with the younger players in our house who could use his fiery form to avoid enemy damage while the more skilled players cleaned up."}

To add salt to injury, the former governor of Lagos State recently told the world that Nigerians now spend less on fuel and generators as electricity supply has improved tremendously!\nWhile Nigerians are willing to stomach the blatant untruths, their pain is more exacerbated by the kind of bills they receive from these the electricity distribution company every month. It\u2019s no more news that a majority of electricity consumers are being billed on estimation as they don\u2019t have pre-paid meters that will accurately account for the voltage of electricity they consume on a daily basis.\nAs if that one is not enough, the Federal Government is reportedly planning to sell electricity to Burkina Faso, as according to reports, that country is willing to pay more for the electricity! The same electricity that Nigerians hardly get up to six hours a day is the one to be sold to another country! In essence, Nigeria will supply electricity to other countries like Niger, Chad etc while they supply darkness to Nigerians!\nJust like the GSM revolution that came with the pay-as-you-call package, Nigerians over the years have been clamouring for pre-paid meters that will make them to not only regulate their electricity consumption but also make them to be sure that they are being charged the appropriate amount of their consumption.\nGranted that this business of power generation, transmission and distribution is no mean business as it is a capital intensive venture, globally, electricity supply does not come cheap and we allude to the fact that the power sector and government daily make huge investments on generation, transmission and distribution of power to Nigerians. However, in other climes of which some of us have been privileged to visit, the issue of electricity consumption is handled with utmost caution. For instance, I have observed where people living overseas put off their bulbs once they are out of the kitchen or toilet. They only put them on when they need to use them. The reason being that leaving the light on will be extracting some points and money from their pre-paid cards which is constantly reading on usage. These are countries that even use less consuming energy-saving bulbs and gadgets, unlike in Nigeria where we leave our high voltage 100 watts bulbs from morning till night. Most people leave their security bulbs on from morning till night, day in day out. Some even leave their air-conditioning system on when leaving the house in the morning. According to them, they want to return in the night to meet their rooms chilled like cold rooms!\nBe that as it may, the big question that has been begging for answer is what is the big deal in providing pre-paid meters to all electricity consumers. What stops the government and investors from flooding the country with pre-paid meter manufacturing companies that will mass-produce meters for the whole country? Nigerians are even willing to buy the meters even though the extant position of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission is that pre-paid meters are to be issued free of charge as it is the sole property of the electricity companies.\nBut why"}

Located in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, Colorado, Indian Peaks Wilderness is characterized by jagged peaks and granite mountains, interspersed with nearly 50 lakes. Although campers won't find campgrounds in the 76,000-acre Indian Peaks Wilderness, which is managed by the Forest Service and the National Park Service, overnight camping is permitted in accordance with wilderness regulations.\nDue to the popularity of Indian Peaks and the fragility of the landscape, camping is regulated within the wilderness area. If you are visiting in peak season, June 1 to September 15, purchase a backcountry permit for overnight camping. Quotas are in place. A small section of wilderness along the northern boundary, above the treeline, lies within Rocky Mountain National Park, and no camping is allowed here. Camping is not permitted from May 1 through November 30 in the Four Lakes Backcountry Zone. Campfires are not allowed in the eastern section of Indian Peaks and around lakes. Where they are allowed, they must be at least 100 feet from any trail or body of water.\nFollow the seven \u201cLeave No Trace\u201d principles when camping in Indian Peaks to help ensure this wilderness area is left intact for future generations. Plan ahead and prepare; travel and camp on durable surfaces; dispose of waste properly by packing in and packing out trash and leftover food; leave what you find, including rocks and plants; minimize campfire impacts; respect and never feed wildlife; and be considerate of other visitors. In addition, Indian Peaks Wilderness' rules state that your dogs must be on a leash at all times, and you need to bury human waste at least 200 feet from water in holes that are 6 to 8 inches deep.\nMake a list before you set off on your camping trip to ensure you\u2019re not stuck in the wilderness without essential supplies. You need a map of the Indian Peaks area and a compass, food and water, extra warm and waterproof clothing, a first aid kit and a flashlight. A cook stove has less impact on the environment than a campfire, and you will also need a knife and matches. Don\u2019t forget a water filter, whistle, all the tent poles you need, and a sleeping bag.\nIndian Peaks offers 110 miles of trails to help you in finding a good camping location and seeing the sights of the wilderness area. For example, the six-mile Arapaho Glacier Trail to Arapaho Glacier Overlook provides views over the City of Boulder Watershed, while the 1.2-mile Rainbow Lakes Trail is an easy trek up to the Rainbow Lakes. In addition, there are four trail passes for vistas over Devil's Thumb, Buchanan, Arapahoe and Pawnee.\nIndian Peaks is next to the Rocky Mountain National Park and is one of the most popular wilderness areas in America due to its proximity to the Denver/Boulder metro area. Indian Peaks is an expansive space, but two main access points lead you into the wilderness from the Boulder/Nederland area and from near Lake Granby in Grand County. Nearby towns include Boulder, Nederland, Granby, Grand Lake, Raymond, Ward, Tabernash, Allenspark, Peaceful Valley, Fraser, Winter Park and Eldora.\nCarr, Louise. \"Camping in Indian Pe"}

Doug Ducey is blaming the crisis on the border on federal laws he says are providing incentives for people to seek asylum.\nThe governor said that people who try to get across the border often are \"coached by individuals to say things that allow them to come in the country.'' Those laws, Ducey said, need to be changed.\n\"The system is at a breaking point,'' he said. \"That's why there's a crisis, that's why you see the pictures'' of crowds of people at the border.\nThe governor's comments come on the heels of the apparently forced resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen as head of the Department of Homeland Security.

Vitiello to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying his administration is \"going in a tougher direction'' in dealing with illegal immigration and specifically the flood of people presenting themselves as the border seeking asylum.\n\"All of the Cabinet secretaries serve as the pleasure of the president,'' he said, calling her \"a model public servant.''

{"idx": "33245", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to address the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Sub-Committee on Middle East and South Asia.\nFor the past seven years relations between the United States and Syria have been fraught \u2013 the product of intense disagreement over policy toward Iraq, Lebanon, and Israel. The dominant view of Syria that has developed in Washington during this period is that of a country ruled by an unreliable leader, with ruthless ambitions to dominate its smaller Lebanese neighbor, harboring Palestinian terrorists and Iraqi insurgents, and maintaining an alliance with Iran \u2013 a strategic adversary of the United States.\nIn these circumstances, Syria\u2019s opposition to American interests has provided ample justification for a policy of containment and isolation. Consequently, Syria remains on the State Department\u2019s Terrorism List, our ambassador has been recalled, and Congress has imposed a range of additional, unilateral sanctions on the Assad regime.\nThe results of this policy are mixed, at best. On one side, Syria has managed to prevent the election of a new Lebanese president and has thereby stymied Lebanese politics, advantaging its local allies (Hezbollah and some Christian factions). It has facilitated the rearming of Hezbollah to pre-2006 war levels. It continues to provide safe-haven and succor to Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Palestinian terrorist groups that violently oppose the Annapolis peace process. And it suppresses all political dissent inside Syria.\nOn the other side, Syria for the time being is cooperating with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. It has attenuated its support for Iraqi insurgents. President Assad continues to assert his interest in making peace with Israel and sent an official delegation to the Annapolis peace conference. He is also careful not to provoke conflict with Israel, or even retaliate for Israel\u2019s strike on what appears to have been a clandestine Syrian nuclear facility.\nIn short, Syria fits the category of a \u201crogue regime\u201d but is doing just enough to avoid making itself the target of a regime change policy from the Bush Administration.\ni) The Government of Israel is keenly interested in engaging Syria in peace negotiations but President Assad will only agree to do so if the United States participates too.\nii) Syria provides the conduit for Iranian influence in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Restricting that pipeline would constitute a strategic setback to Iran, which has become America\u2019s main regional adversary.\nAn Israeli-Syrian peace holds considerable advantage for U.S. interests in the Middle East. It would remove the last of Israel\u2019s neighboring Arab states from the conflict, helping to stabilize the region and enhancing America\u2019s reputation as peacemaker at a time when Iran is arguing that violence and terrorism is the answer to the region\u2019s afflictions. It would also provide important political cover for other Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel. And it would create a wedge between Syria and Iran that has the potential for shifting the balance of regional power back in our favor after our ill-fated Iraq adventure managed to tilt it in Iran\u2019s.\nAs I understand it, the Bush Administration is unwilling to encourage Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations out of concern that this would reduce Syria\u2019s isolation and result in the sacrificing of Lebanon\u2019s independence on the altar of an Israeli-Syrian peace. But this puts the U.S. in the unprecedented and invidious position of opposing an opportunity for Arab-Israeli peacemaking even when our ally Israel is keen to pursue it"}

{"idx": "33250", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Currently, hundreds of scientists, policy-makers, civil servants and politicians are spending some time together in Montreal in an effort to achieve some kind of global consensus on how to tackle the ever-growing issue of climate change. For the uninitiated, climate change is a result of taking sequestered carbon, in the form of fossil fuels, and combusting it in the presence of oxygen to form carbon dioxide. That CO2 then enters the atmosphere, and as its concentration increases, so does the amount of heat retained.\nThis has an unbalancing effect on climates; an example would be the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is a current of warm water that travels from the Caribbean up across the North Atlantic to the UK and Northern Europe, bringing with it milder winters. As the water cools, it sinks, travelling south and eventually round Cape Hope. In addition to heat, the other principle driver of this process is salinity. If you were to decrease salinity in the arctic ocean, by, say, melting lots of fresh water in the form of glaciers and ice, then the the water no longer sinks and the current shuts down.\nthat the circulation has weakened by 6m tonnes of water a second.\nmonitor changes in the current continuously.\nThat won't just be bad news for those of us in Northern Europe though. If that warm water isn't heading up to the pole, it will simply recirculate in the tropical Atlantic, and lots of warm water in the mid Atlantic means one thing - hurricanes. And nevermind thinking about what happens to all the methane clathrates that are currently sitting on the sea floor in the region. As ocean temperatures increase, the methane will thaw and outgas into the atmosphere, and boy, if you thought CO2 was a good climate change gas you'll just love CH4!\n\"There's no longer any serious doubt that climate change is real, accelerating and caused by human activities. We are uncertain about how deep and time of arrival of the consequences, but we are quite clear that they will not be good,\" said Clinton.\nHe put down the main U.S. fear about Kyoto -- that it would hurt the economy by chaining it to greenhouse gas reductions that were not achievable.\nThat claim, he said, \"was flat wrong.\"\n\"And we know with every passing year we get more and more objective data (that) if we had a serious disciplined effort to apply on a large-scale, existing clean energy and energy conservation technologies -- we could meet and surpass the Kyoto targets easily in a way that would strengthen, not weaken, our economy,\" said Clinton to applause from the delegates.\nSadly, whilst that might be the word from the past US administration, the current one is behaving true to form. Even as China and the rest of the developing world were finally throwing their weight behind the efforts, in a characteristic temper tantrum, the US delegation walked out and refuse to continue talks, or even negotiate on arranging further discussions.\nThe Bush administration was sharply criticized by other governments and by environmental groups for walking out of a round of informal discussions shortly after midnight that were aimed at finding new ways of curbing gases.\n\"This shows just how willing the U.S. administration is to walk away from a healthy planet and its responsibilities to its own people,\" said Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund.\nI am reminded now of a satire piece I once read, regarding another fit of pique by Mr Bush.

{"idx": "33256", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Does Cooking a Mushroom Deplete Its Vitamin Content?\n3 What Benefits Can You Get From Eating Mushrooms?\nMushrooms are a versatile food that can be eaten raw or cooked and incorporated into a wide array of meals. Cooking mushrooms causes them to lose water and shrink. Although they are less nutrient-dense and protein-rich than raw mushrooms, the smaller size of cooked mushrooms may encourage you to eat more of them in a sitting.\nBy volume, cooked mushrooms are nutritionally comparable to raw mushrooms. However, a cup of cooked mushrooms contains twice as many mushrooms as a cup of raw mushrooms. Each mushroom loses up to half of its nutrients, particularly its water-soluble vitamin content, when it is cooked. To properly compare raw mushrooms to cooked mushrooms, use the same number of mushrooms, rather than weight or volume.\nSix large, raw white mushrooms have 24 calories and 1.1 grams of fiber. Cooking them reduces their calorie content to 20 and increases their fiber content to 1.6 grams. More significantly, six raw mushrooms contain 3.3 grams of protein. When cooked, they lose more than half of their protein content and provide only 1.5 grams of protein. A serving of cooked or raw mushrooms has approximately .35 grams of fat, but raw mushrooms are higher in sugar, with 2.1 grams per serving compared to 1.7 grams of sugar in the cooked mushrooms.\nInterestingly, cooking increases the amount of antioxidant vitamin C in mushrooms. Six raw white mushrooms have 2.3 milligrams, and six cooked mushrooms have 2.9 milligrams. The rest of the vitamins are decreased, however. Six raw mushrooms have .2 milligrams of vitamin D, a nutrient that benefits your bones by helping your body absorb calcium. Cooking them depletes their vitamin D content by half.\nMushrooms lose a significant amount of B vitamins when you cook them. Six raw white mushrooms provide 0.09 milligrams of thiamin, 0.4 milligrams of riboflavin, 0.12 milligrams of vitamin B-6, 18 micrograms of folate and 3.9 milligrams of niacin. They give you 40 percent of your daily requirement for riboflavin, 28 percent for niacin and 6 to 10 percent for vitamin B-6, folate and thiamin. Although they still provide 23 percent of the niacin you need each day, they have less than half as much riboflavin, vitamin B-6 and folate as raw mushrooms, and about two-thirds as much thiamin.\nCooking mushrooms produces mixed results regarding mineral content. Boiling white mushrooms depletes them of magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium. Although most of the differences are subtle, a serving of cooked mushrooms has only one-fifth the sodium of a serving of raw mushrooms. Cooking mushrooms increases their store of other minerals, however. Six raw mushrooms have 3 milligrams of calcium, 0.6 milligrams of zinc and 0.5 milligrams of iron, but cooking them increases these numbers to 4 milligrams of calcium, 0.6 milligrams of zinc and 1."}

For this group, switching to tobacco harm reduction products may present less harm than continuing to smoke conventional cigarettes,\" he said.\nTobacco smoking is the single most important preventable cause of ill health and death in Australia, and smoking cessation is the only intervention with the potential to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the short and medium term. However, an emerging category of products, known as Tobacco Harm Reduction products, offers an alternative for smokers unwilling or unable to quit.\nClick here to read the complete White Paper which shares further details on this study which discusses understanding of and Attitudes Towards Tobacco Harm Reduction Products.\nFor over five decades, Frost & Sullivan has become world-renowned for its role in helping investors, corporate leaders and governments navigate economic changes and identify disruptive technologies, Mega Trends, new business models and companies to action, resulting in a continuous flow of growth opportunities to drive future success.

Yet it is important to counteract that ingrained perception that car-based business is 'better'. Transportation Alternatives found that of the four different mobility groups, cyclists and peds spent the most (when looking at weekly spending).\nlocal businesses. Car and subway users spend less per capita, $143 and $111, respectively, according to TA.\nIn Portland, Oregon, a less dense city, researcher Kelly Clifton found a slightly different yet also persuasive case that over time, pedestrians and cyclists spend more than their car-driving brethren.\nClifton and her team collected surveys at 89 spots in Portland, finding out how much money people spent, how often they visited, and how far they traveled to get there. The majority of people, it should be said, still arrived at the different locations by car.\nAnd looking at single visits, car drivers spent more at supermarkets and restaurants than the other transport modes. Yet it turns out that walkers, bikers, and public transport takers visit the locations more frequently, and thus, over the space of a month, spent more.\nAt convenience and supermarkets, walkers spent more. At bars and restaurants, bikers and transit users were neck and neck on spending, in both cases ahead of car drivers.\nThis is good news for planners trying to keep local business vibrant.\nConventional merchants are afraid to lose parking spaces to bike parking or bike lanes.

Only in recent years, after having left college teaching, did I finally become converted (in both senses of the term)\u2014thus becoming, ironically, an enthusiastic contributor to such esteemed online newsletters as CounterPunch.

Research also shows that illicit funds are important in funding elections in the country.\nDespite constant chatter about the massive (and rising) costs of election campaigns in India, there is a dearth of credible data on the actual costs, the sources of support for candidates, and the implications of campaign costs on governance between elections.\nHowever, newly available survey data on politicians in three of India\u2019s largest and most electorally competitive states\u2014Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh \u2014offer a unique and systematic view into the nature of campaign finance across all levels of elected office, from the gram panchayat to the Lok Sabha, and the possible repercussions for Indian democracy. These data, collected between 2011 and 2014 from surveys of more than 2,500 incumbent politicians, provide insights into the role of political parties in funding elections, candidates\u2019 sources of campaign support, and the specific, and troubling, importance of illicit funds.\nThe survey asked politicians about their own spending in past elections, sources of both financial and non-financial assistance, perception of the spending habits of their peers, and, perhaps most importantly, the role of cash in their campaigns.\nWhat did we find? It\u2019s worth starting with what we did not find: accurate estimates of campaign spending. Most respondents report spending less on campaigns than the official limits, despite regular grumbling by politicians about the exceedingly strict campaign finance limits imposed by the Election Commission.\nThus, either the anecdotal reports are wrong or politicians are unwilling to report honestly on their spending. One piece of evidence in favour of the second explanation is the fact that politicians at all levels indicate their peers spent at least double what they themselves spent, suggesting that their own reports are severe underestimates.\nThe politicians\u2019 responses were not all such obvious affectations of innocence, however, and there is much we can learn from what they did report.\nA key question posed by election analysts, to date unanswered, is the degree to which political parties provide financial support to candidates for office at various tiers of government . We found that party support was far more prevalent at higher levels of office.\nMore than 60% of politicians at the state and national levels report receiving political party support, compared to fewer than 10% of respondents at the district level and lower.\nThese are also substantial contributions\u2014with the average amount received at state and national levels making up at least half of reported spending. Thus, political parties play a prominent role in funding high-level elections, while individuals running for office in local councils must instead rely on their own funds for the lion\u2019s share of their campaign. Lower level politicians are further inhibited by a lack of access to financing from private sector and bureaucratic actors, which is more prevalent at higher levels.\nWho else might influence elected officials? Answering this question requires attention to broader non-financial forms of election support. Politicians disclosed information about who helped them during the campaign, and here too we see substantial variation across levels of elected office.\nState and national-level politicians reported support from a much wider range of actors, but they were particularly reliant on other elected officials, party workers, and individual fixers. Panchayat politicians, in contrast, were relatively more reliant on help from local organisations, such as village or neighborhood associations.\nGiven the differences in their relative importance during the campaign period, it seems plausible that local associations are more likely to have influence over politicians at the sub-state level while political parties are more likely to have sway over politicians at higher levels"}

It would take astronauts at least nine months to get there, they might spend a year on the planet itself, and they would then spend another nine months on the journey home. During that time they would be exposed both to high radiation levels and to the increasingly irritating tics and habits of their fellow crew. It is hard to say which of these would be more likely to result in someone\u2019s death.\nBut though the scientific value of such a mission is questionable, as a propaganda stunt it would be unequalled. America\u2019s space agency, NASA, is therefore looking into ways of preserving both the physical and the mental health of putative Martian voyagers. And, at this year\u2019s meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), held in Washington, DC, several presentations described work towards that end.\nOne such effort is the NASA Twin Study, full results of which are to be published in the next few months. The AAAS meeting was, however, given a taster.\nThe NASA Twin Study took advantage of identical-twin astronauts Mark and Scott Kelly. Scott was launched to the International Space Station in 2015 for a 12-month tour as station commander. Mark remained on Earth for the same period. Both men gave regular samples of blood, urine and so on for scientific analysis. Both also undertook batteries of physical and mental tests. Not knowing exactly what might change in the men\u2019s bodies, ten teams of researchers spread across America combed through the samples and results to track as many molecular, cognitive and physical changes as possible.\nAs Chris Mason of Weill Cornell Medical College told the meeting, these teams found lots of surprises. For example, Scott\u2019s telomeres got longer during his sojourn in space. Telomeres are strands of DNA that cap the end of chromosomes in a cell\u2019s nucleus. They normally get shorter as that cell divides and ages.\nDr Mason then compared the operation of Scott\u2019s genes with those of his brother back on Earth. Genes in Scott\u2019s body associated with the immune system, he found, became highly active. This was also true of the cellular machinery associated with repairing DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the body is in high alert,\u201d he said, which would not be surprising given the stresses of space flight. Another surprising observation was the presence of a lot of mitochondrial fragments in Scott\u2019s blood. Mitochondria are tiny structures within a cell which release energy from sugar. They tend to get into the bloodstream only when cells are damaged or dying of stress.\nFrom Scott\u2019s point of view, the good news is that almost all of the thousands of changes catalogued in his body reverted to normal soon after he returned to Earth. This suggests that, for the most part, a healthy human body recovers well from the stress of space flight. But however detailed the Twin Study has been (and it was in fact the most detailed scientific portrait of human beings ever made) a sample size of two is still rather limited. In the coming years NASA is planning dozens more long-duration tests on people, including tracking astronauts heading to the moon in preparation for future trips to Mars.\nWhen Scott returned from the space station, he said that \u201cteamwork makes the dream work\u201d when it comes to a successful mission in space. Cutesy. But it was an apt statement. Understanding how teams function, how they go wrong and how to prevent social problems will be a critical element of any successful mission to Mars.\nSuch a mission might involve half a dozen people, perhaps from different cultures, cooped"}

A key shift, if it's eventually approved, would be the merging of two major sets of codes now: those governing the Extra-territorial Zone, a five-mile swatch around the city of Las Cruces in which development is jointly governed by the city and the county, and those applying to the remainder of the unincorporated county outside the ETZ. The ETZ was created in 1989, with its own zoning, with the aim of ensuring development around the city would meet city standards so it could eventually be annexed, as the city grew. Outside the ETZ, there are loose zoning regulations.\nP & Z Commissioner Greg Daviet said the proposed UDC attempts to streamline what can be a cumbersome development process to navigate for county residents and developers working in the unincorporated areas with two jurisdictions \u2014 the ETZ and the rest of the unincorporated area \u2014 and, in the ETZ, two governmental bodies are involved in different aspects of the process.\n\"The first thing I would mention is that the Unified Development Code is a discussion of the unification of nine different county ordinances and ETZ ordinances, two comprehensive plans and two jurisdictions into a single comprehensive plan, a single ordinance and single jurisdiction,\" he said.\nIn addition to the complexity of dealing with two governments, the boundaries of the ETZ can change rapidly, Daviet said. When the city annexes territory, the ETZ's boundaries automatically expand, incorporating new territory. So county residents can be living outside the ETZ one day and inside it the next.\nAnother issue in the ETZ, Daviet said, is that zone changes have often been granted \"in ways that weren't always predictable, and we recognized that is a deficiency in the current process.\" Zone changes aren't meant to be granted lightly.\nP & Z Commissioner Mel Acosta said development has occurred hodgepodge across the county historically. He's hoping the UDC will change that.\n\"We're trying to get the county into a uniform way of developing,\" he said.\nThe UDC also would essentially eliminate the ETZ as it currently exists, county officials have said.\nThroughout its development, the UDC proposal has drawn criticism for a variety of reasons. A number of residents have expressed concerns about how its early stages were formed and how draft versions of the plans were difficult track. Some critics have taken aim at major provisions in the document, which introduce a new method of zoning, called Transect Zones, as well as a new model for building subdivisions, called Community Types.

The Senate approved the measure on a 31-8 vote to send it to Kelly. She is expected to sign it.\n\"The Kansas Legislature took an important step today towards addressing the needs of our students, supporting our teachers and fully funding our schools,\" Kelly said in a written statement. \"I\u2019m proud this reasonable, commonsense plan was embraced with bipartisan support today. Kansans want their leaders to work together to move our state forward.\"\nThe bill ties Kelly's proposal to increase spending on public schools by roughly $90 million to several education policy changes favored by GOP lawmakers, including a requirement for a new one-page online performance report on each public school.\nJohn Robb, an attorney representing the schools, says the bill still is not adequate.\n\"The math just doesn't do it,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThe court gave the state\u2019s attorneys until April 15 to file a written report on lawmakers\u2019 response.\nBut Ward, other Democrats and Republicans who support the bill see passing Kelly\u2019s proposal as preferable, given an implied threat with each Supreme Court ruling that it could shut down schools if it finds that funding remains insufficient under the state constitution. Legislators are scheduled to start their annual spring break Saturday and return May 1 to wrap up business for the year. Oral arguments in the case are set for May 9.\nSome Republicans, particularly conservatives, question whether the state will be able to sustain Kelly\u2019s proposed new spending without a future tax increase. GOP leaders also pushed a tax relief bill designed to prevent individuals and businesses from paying more in state income taxes because of changes in federal tax laws at the end of 2017, which the governor vetoed.\n\"We will have to raise taxes.

House GOP leaders wanted to earmark much of the new money to programs for at-risk students but relented Wednesday when it became clear senators would not budge in negotiations.\nBackers of the bill hope a show of bipartisan support will persuade the Supreme Court to find Kelly\u2019s plan acceptable.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the best we can do right now,\u201d said Rep.

Some barangay captains were allegedly offered as much as P50,000 to help a candidate win. Some voters were paid P500 to as high as P3,000.\nSome devious politicians reportedly paid supporters of their rivals and compelled them to put blue ink on their right index finger, which prevented them from voting even if they proceeded to the polling center.\nTo top all of these, seven election volunteers were ambushed and killed by armed men in Rosario, Cavite a few hours before voting began.

The ships will run on both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and diesel, and are being built at the Scheepswerf Ferus Smit yard in the Netherlands for Sweden based Erik Thun AB. The order with W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 was booked in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn 2014, the Scheepswerf Ferus Smit yard built two cement carriers on behalf of Erik Thun AB. These are now operated by JT Cement; a joint venture company with Norway based KG Jebsen Cement. Those ships also feature W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 dual-fuel propulsion, and this latest order can be seen as an endorsement of both the owner and the shipyard's satisfaction with the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 technology.\nThe 115 meter long coastal tankers feature a 'next generation' design focusing on high energy efficiency, low noise levels both above and below the water, and environmental sustainability. The W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 solutions were selected primarily because they meet all these criteria. The full scope of supply for each of the four vessels includes a 6-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 34DF dual-fuel main engine, a W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 LNGPac fuel supply system, a W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Gas Valve Unit (GVU), and a Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP) with HP nozzle. The equipment will be delivered to the yard commencing in 2018.\nA notable feature of the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 fuel system to be supplied is its open type Tank Connection Space (TCS) that allows natural ventilation. The benefits of this system are its reduced weight, a combined cargo heating medium that controls the temperature both inside the TCS as well as for evaporating the LNG, less installation work for the yard, and a reduced power supply requirement.\n\"The fuel efficiency of the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 34DF engine, whether in gas or diesel mode, was a prime consideration in its selection for these 'next generation' tankers. Similarly, the successful track record of both the CPP and LNGPac solutions, and the proven efficiencies that they have demonstrated, were convincing arguments in our favor,\" says, Aaron Bresnahan, Vice President, Sales, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Marine Solutions.\n\"We have worked closely with W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 on many projects for more than 45 years, and we recognize their technical expertise and the reliability of their products. We are pleased, therefore, to have W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 as a partner for this project where efficiency and sustainability are the key essentials,\" says Anders K\u00e4llson, Managing Director, Erik Thun AB.\nWhen delivered, the ice-class 1A vessels will be capable of handling the year round sailing conditions in the Baltic Sea."}

What happens when one of them goes rogue and can\u2019t stopped? It\u2019s fundamentally a call for a checks and balances approach -- one that applies to various aspects of life and business.\nFor a tech-focused example of the need for \u201cwatchers,\u201d consider a typical IT department\u2019s system management tool. These tools are used by IT departments of all sizes, from small start-ups to larger early-stage firms with explosive growth. These tools are similar to a hero protecting citizens, but in this case it\u2019s a company\u2019s valuable data requiring protection. But what happens if the tool itself is compromised or malfunctions? Who watches the performance of the tool when the tool itself is designed to do the watching?\nThis is a question many businesses face when using agent-based solutions. If the agent is compromised and backdoor access is gained through the agent, then what happens to the network? Are there measures in place to mitigate the branding disaster that could follow? For some context, an agent is software that runs on a system and sends information to a central location for use by another program or service. Agentless solutions still collect the necessary data, but use the previously installed software instead of installing and maintaining software on every machine in the network.\nThe problem of unauthorized access or comprised agents is not simply a theoretical scenario. Recently, Panda Security and Symantec Altiris IT Management Suite (ITMS) had emergency patches released for their agent-based endpoint management software. Both clients had vulnerabilities in the agents that enabled unauthorized access to installed networks. It gave unauthorized users the ability to access system-level privileges, effectively controlling the system management tool undetected.\nAs always, some of the responsibility falls to IT managers, but it\u2019s a tall order when you\u2019re entrusting the solution to perform a certain way and it misbehaves unexpectedly. It\u2019s this unpredictability that explains why agentless technologies are gaining traction in the market.\nUnder an agentless model the functionality remains the same, but there is no footprint left once the assigned tasks are complete. There\u2019s nothing installed on the endpoint, which removes access points that outside elements could use to gain control. It\u2019s similar to another comic hero -- Batman. When there\u2019s a need for him he appears and cleans up crime, but when the job is done he fades away into Bruce Wayne. Agentless technologies do the same thing \u2013 they get the job done when the need arises, but don\u2019t stay longer than necessary and potentially ruin a smooth running situation."}

The balance of funding comes from Deer Industry New Zealand (DINZ).\nDINZ chief executive officer Dan Coup said he was grateful for the support provided by the fund, which has appreciated the novelty and the merit of the Advance Parties concept.\nSix Advance Parties have already been formed, each involving six to eight farmers, who are trialling the concept. Each farmer identifies on-farm issues that are limiting profitability and works with other farmers to come up with solutions.\n\u201cBefore getting involved, farmers agree to adopt management changes, record the outcome of those changes and to share the results with the wider deer farming community. DINZ provides an independent facilitator for each party, technical back-up and crunches the on-farm data,\u201d says Mr Coup.\nIn its funding application DINZ says that with improved genetics, feeding and animal health the industry could double its export sales in seven years, with little increase in inputs.\nThis is highlighted by Statistics NZ figures that show an average fawn survival to sale percentage of 74 per cent, a figure that has remained constant for 20 years.\n\u201cIt is up to the farmers in each party to decide what issues they want to focus on. But if it was increasing fawn survival to 85 per cent, that alone would increase net farm income per hind by $40.

In most films this might be considered a negative, but not in \"Gothika,\" which earned one preview audience's lusty applause the further afield it ventured. After all, you know DVD cult heaven is near when a long, carefully choreographed flight to freedom ends with a guard casually tossing his car keys to a would-be escapee.\nOf course the greatest mystery here is why Berry would follow her richly deserved Academy Award-winning performance in \"Monster's Ball\" -- and even a high-profile stint as a Bond Girl -- in something like \"Gothika.\" The actress has talent to burn, and she throws herself shaking and sobbing, shrieking and screaming into the role with commendable energy and gravitas.

In his memoir, Salinger remembered what happened the following day.\n\"How did you do, Pierre?\" asked the president as I walked through the door.\n\"Very well,\" I answered. In fact, I'd gotten 1,200 Petit Upmann Cubans. Kennedy smiled, and opened up his desk. He took out a long paper which he immediately signed. It was the decree banning all Cuban products from the United States.\nEl bloqueo (the blockade) remains to this day. Commercial, economic and financial embargoes to and from Cuba still hold, and unless special permission is granted, any U.S. citizen illegally traveling to Cuba can be fined up to $1 million and imprisoned for up to 10 years. But that could change very soon.\nPresident Barack Obama wants to try something that each of his eight predecessors has failed at: to expand opportunities for Americans to travel to Cuba in an effort to encourage more contact between people in both countries.

Now, in a transparency report released today, the company shows that the trend of increased snooping continued unabated in the second half of the year\u2014with much of it authorized without a search warrant.\nU.S. authorities lodged 8,438 requests for user data between July and December, in comparison with 7,969 between January and June (an increase of 6 percent). On average, in 2012 Google complied with about 89 percent of the U.S. requests it received.\nThe rising surveillance figures, which in part may be correlated to growth in the use of Google services, show that between 2010 and 2012, U.S. authorities\u2019 requests for user data have increased by a whopping 85 percent (from 8,888 in 2010 to 16,407 in 2012).

For instance, an airline could advertise a fare and then add a fuel surcharge, increasing the overall cost of the ticket.\nThat could make price comparison more difficult.\n\"It looks like the airlines are going to get free rein to do whatever they want,\" said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research. \"Buying an airfare is confusing enough now. This could make it even more confusing.\"\nFuel is now the biggest expense at airlines, even ahead of labor costs. Though it is the most likely candidate to be broken out as a surcharge, other costs, like insurance, might also get itemized if the ad rules are loosened.\nPassengers have turned out in droves to book their flights through Internet travel sites that compare airfares. Such shopping, along with the spread of low-cost airlines, has pushed prices sharply lower in recent years. Some older airlines with higher costs were nudged into bankruptcy.\nCritics fear looser advertising rules would reduce the transparency of pricing and thus give traditional airlines more market power to raise fares. Well-informed buyers are able to drive a harder bargain in most cases, but opaque pricing favors sellers.\nShopping \"would be more difficult and would take much more searching around,\" John Herrman, a retired college professor in Libby, Mont., said of the proposed relaxing of the rules. \"That's because airlines would doubtlessly make it difficult to determine comparative costs.\"Tabby Stone, a pediatrician in Playa Del Ray, Calif., said of the Transportation Department, which regulates fare advertising, \"If they allow it, then the government doesn't care about truth in advertising.\"\nThe lobbying battle is essentially shaping up as a fight between older airlines and everyone else. The older airlines -- United Airlines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines -- are smarting from price competition. The rest, a coalition of travel agents, individual travelers and low-cost carriers, like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, have made the industry more price competitive.\nSouthwest sees the proposed changes as a way to blunt apples-to-apples price comparisons. United says the existing rules are unnecessary for an industry deregulated nearly 30 years ago. United would not say how it might change its ads if allowed to.\nIn comments to the Transportation Department, it appears that most individuals opposed loosening ad regulations. But experts nevertheless expect the agency to approve some relaxing of the rules.\nLoosening the rules is all but a done deal, concluded Paul M. Ruden, senior vice president for legal and industry affairs at the American Society of Travel Agents. \"Why else would this rule be up for re-evaluation?\" he said. \"They want to make it more difficult for people to compare fares.\" The current rules work fine, Mr. Ruden added.\nBrian Turmail, a Transportation Department spokesman, said that no decision has been made yet. \"We're committed to doing this in a thorough"}

Supporters say patients diagnosed with fewer than six months to live should have the choice to relieve their suffering by dying by suicide.\nLDS Church policy considers assisted suicide to be euthanasia and a violation of God's commandments, according to a church policy guide known as Handbook 2, which is referred to in the letter.\n\"The church maintains a firm belief in the sanctity of human life,\" the First Presidency letter said, \"and opposes deliberately taking the life of a person even when the person may be suffering from an incurable condition or disease. Life is a sacred gift and should be cherished even in difficult circumstances.\"\nChurch leaders noted that physician-assisted suicide is permitted by law in some states and countries but said research has uncovered problems with the practice.\n\"Experience suggests that such legalization can endanger the vulnerable, erode trust in the medical profession and cheapen human life and dignity,\" the First Presidency wrote. \"Moreover, the decision to end one's life carries a lasting impact far beyond the person whose life is ending.\"\n\"The church is right to be concerned,\" said Margaret Dore, president of Choice is an Illusion, a group based in Washington, which has a physician-assisted suicide law, as does neighboring Oregon.\n\"Basically, the Colorado bill makes people sitting ducks for their relatives, or their heirs and other predators,\" Dore said. \"It's a recipe for elder abuse, really."}

I doubt very many of us have ever thought of putting the words \u201cenvironment\u201d and \u201cethics\u201d in the same sentence, kind of like \u201cecological psychology.\u201d A quick look at the daily newspapers gives us plenty of reasons to see why ethics is a very important part of taking care of an ever-more damaged environment.\nOne of the tools we use to protect our environment is to monitor species of plants and animals in their habitats to see how their numbers are holding up. Prime areas for gas and oil extraction are also habitat for the greater sage grouse. Destroying this habitat destroys these birds and many other plants and animals.\nProtection of the grouse thereby sets up a conflict with oil- and gas-interest profits, tax revenue for local governments, jobs that depend on the payrolls of the extraction companies and spill out into the greater economy, and the politicians whose careers depend on the flow of cash (directly and indirectly). On the other side, the growth, which is often temporary, puts pressure on social support systems like schools and public health. Oil and gas extraction is also detrimental to water resources, local infrastructure and quality of life of many local people.\nOn a larger scale, continued use of the fossil fuels taken out of the ground is one of the primary causes of global warming. Also, recent research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claims that some 200,000 Americans die early because of air pollution that is caused by fossil-fuel use. Some 58,000 of those people\u2019s deaths are attributed mainly to vehicle-caused pollution, the largest single category. People are dying an average of 12 years earlier than they otherwise would.\nProtecting the sage grouse requires not drilling in some areas. Politicians in these development areas are filing lawsuits against the agencies that have created the rules to protect the sage grouse. The local politicians are saying that they can do a better job of protecting the grouse than the federal government. On the other hand, the federal rules were put in place because we found, from the history of industrialization in our country, that local governments were unwilling or unable to protect our natural resources.\nEthical choices are at the heart of these problems. Environmental ethics is a crucial field. In fact, our lives depend on it."}

He grew up Christian fundamentalist and would occasionally hear about Sunday at revival meetings, but he says he never really got a clear idea of who the man was.\nBilly Sunday was one of the most influential preachers within the American evangelical movement. He preached in Chicago and across the country beginning in the 1890s through the end of Prohibition, a time when the country was divided over whether or not you could regulate morality and the consumption of alcohol. The song lyrics Aaron\u2019s wondering about capture this moment in history when Chicago found itself at the center of this great debate.\nIn the 1880s, after moving from Iowa to play baseball with the Chicago White Stockings \u2014 the team that later became the Cubs \u2014 Sunday began attending services at the Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago\u2019s famous evangelical church and social services center, says Robert Martin, author of the Sunday biography, Hero of the Heartland.\nAt this time, there was a growing Protestant evangelical movement developing within the United States that was accompanied by a push to regulate alcohol, which was seen as a destructive moral force.\nIt was during this period that Sunday says he underwent a religious conversion and felt increasingly called to religious work, says Martin. In the early 1890s, he quit baseball to work at the YMCA in Chicago. From there, Sunday began assisting with revival meetings across the Midwest \u2014 meetings that in a few years, Martin says, he\u2019d be leading.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a meteoric rise to fame, it\u2019s a slow gradual process from what he called a kerosene circuit \u2014 small towns with no electricity \u2014 to larger and larger towns and cities until by the early teens he\u2019s beginning to preach in big cities,\u201d Martin says.\nSunday preached about a lot of social and political issues, like the dangers of communism and teaching evolution in schools. His beliefs were in line with the values of a lot midwesterners at the time, Martin says.\nIn the 1910s, more and more Americans \u2014 especially Protestants like Sunday \u2014 were drawn to the moral arguments of the temperance movement, a reform movement which advocated against the consumption of alcohol.\nAs Sunday\u2019s crowds grew larger, Martin says Sunday\u2019s onstage antics became increasingly physical and even vitriolic and just as important to drawing crowds as the message he was preaching.\nSunday\u2019s popularity grew in the years leading up to Prohibition, especially in major cities.

Bush and Mr. Obama.\nThe raid, in which just about everything went wrong, was an early test of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security decision-making \u2014 and his willingness to rely on the assurances of his military advisers. His aides say that even though the decision was made over a dinner, it had been fully vetted, and had the requisite legal approvals.\nMr. Trump will soon have to make a decision about the more general request by the Pentagon to allow more of such operations in Yemen without detailed, and often time-consuming, White House review. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will allow that, or how the series of mishaps that marked his first approval of such an operation may have altered his thinking about the human and political risks of similar operations.\nThe Pentagon has said that the main objective of the raid was to recover laptop computers, cellphones and other information that could help fill gaps in its understanding of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, whose leaders have tried to carry out at least three attacks on the United States. But it is unclear whether the information the commandos recovered will prove valuable.\nThe White House continued its defense of the raid on Tuesday, making no reference to the Yemeni reaction.\nNeither the White House nor the Yemenis have publicly announced the suspension.

Though he has suffered from cirrhosis for 10 years, the chance of that happening is virtually zero.\nA thousand miles south in tiny Morven, Ga., Katryna Grisson \u2014 equally sick, just three years older and, like Perez Remache, on Medicaid \u2014 awaits the same miracle.\nHer odds, however, are substantially better, because the ratio of available livers to people who need them is more favorable in the southeast.\n\"Basically, it's not fair that my dad has to wait until he gets sicker and sicker,\" said Alex Perez, Perez Remache's 22-year-old son. \"What's the point of getting [a liver] when you're sicker? Before they find a liver, he's dead already.\"\nUnder a proposed plan, that could change. The people who control transplants in the United States are preparing to consider a way to address the decades-old geographic disparity in liver allocation. The plan would alter how the precious organs are distributed and could shift hundreds of livers across state and regional borders.\nHow to distribute organs is the ultimate life-or-death decision, one that has divided the liver transplant world into feuding camps for 15 years: those who favor the current system and those who claim it costs lives.\nThe conflict has sparked accusations of ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion of rules, led to lobbying in Congress and prompted more than 60 proposals, all of which have been abandoned.\nBehind the wrangling over patient care is the fact that transplants provide big money to hospitals. A liver transplant is one of the most expensive surgical procedures, costing several hundred thousand dollars, much of it reimbursed by private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. A secure supply of livers is critical to maintaining a lucrative program.\n\"This is so difficult, the amount of passion around this is really daunting,\" said Julie Heimbach, chair of the committee that has proposed the latest revised rules. \"You think you've come up with something that will be good for the whole country, and then you have someone in South Carolina losing their mind over it.\"\nThere are far too few livers donated every year for the people who need them. Last year, 7,841 livers from deceased donors were transplanted in the United States, while another 14,000 people remained on the national waiting list with various liver diseases. More than a thousand people die on the waiting list every year.\nThe new proposal is complex, but the main point of conflict is that it would allow some transplant centers to reach across current district lines to gain access to livers they cannot obtain under current rules. That will create more competition for the organs and alter the way they are distributed, especially in the northeast.\nBecause of factors that affect both supply and demand, access to livers varies dramatically from place to place.\nIn Region 9, for example, which includes New York, just 327 livers were donated in 2016, continuing a pattern of meager procurement that goes back \u00addecades.\nIn Region 3, which includes the Deep South and Puerto Rico, 1,336 livers were obtained from deceased donors, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nonprofit organization that coordinates organ transplantation.\n"}

There can be no compromise between the German rule of law and Sharia law, which has no place in Germany \u2013 a German politician told RT.\nThe problem with the integration of immigrants into German life is that newcomers want society to adopt their culture \u2013 and not vice versa, insists Wolfgang Bosbach, a member of the Christian Democratic Union Party which is part of Germany\u2019s leading coalition.\nRT: When the Chancellor said multiculturalism had failed \u2013 what did she mean by multiculturalism?\nWolfgang Bosbach: Angela Merkel stated that \u201cmultikulti\u201d has failed because in Germany we have too much co-existence rather than togetherness and there are only a few examples of successful integration. There are [actually] millions of examples of successful integration but there are too many examples of refusals and failures. Integration is so important for the improvement of life perspectives of immigrants in Germany. That's why we should not live separately next to each other, so to speak \"multikulti\", but together.\nRT: A lot of the debate has focused on Muslim immigrants rather than the Polish, Italian and Greek population in Germany. Is that fair, to highlight just them as part of the problem?\nWB: We've always had immigration in our history. We have immigrants today and will always have them in the future. Three hundred years ago, every third Berliner and Brandenburger was a French protestant. A hundred years ago, Polish immigrants came to work in mining and steel industries in the Ruhr area, but in recent years and decades, people from other cultural backgrounds came, for instance from Turkey, Northern Africa and Arabic countries. And a long time ago we understood that these people have far bigger problems integrating than those who come from our neighboring European countries.\nRT: So when we talk about integration \u2013 what does your party actually intend to do to help integrate people who are clearly not so at the moment?\nWB: First of all it's the task of the people coming here to integrate themselves into society. One can't come to Germany, sit down and say: government, please integrate me. Instead one has to make an effort to become part of this accepting society, and the state has to make offers to make integration work, especially language courses. Hundreds of thousands have visited language courses over recent years. This is a very encouraging result.\nRT: There were top politicians addressing this issue of immigration with very strong wording. Do you think that this has tapped into people\u2019s often deep prejudices about immigration and about the Islamic religion that they are actually pretty ignorant about?\nWB: I don't think that harsh words were used but rather the right words. Sensible politics begins with looking at the reality. In this reality there are millions of examples of the best kind of integration but there also too many examples of failing and refusing to integrate. And the statistics say that the rate of unemployment among immigrants is double the average among the population. The quota of those receiving welfare among immigrants is three times as high as among the population. And it makes no sense talking around this issue. One must call things as they are, in reality. One cannot say: I find the system of social benefits in Germany very good but not the rule of law. Those who come to Germany must respect the law, the constitution and our cultural traditions.\nRT: Could you clarify where the lines are being drawn and what will be accepted in this country and what won\u2019t be?

I had lived across from Doris for a few years now and had discovered that, although she was fiercely independent, energetic and kept to a rigorous schedule, she was in her late 80s and needed help on occasion. More often than not, I really was happy to set aside a few minutes of my day to open jars, restart modems or unload heavy, unwieldy items from her car.

{"idx": "33360", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: IBM has demonstrated a way to store data in a single atom and could someday use the technique in tiny processors.\nResearchers at IBM's Almaden Research Center in California developed a technique for measuring magnetic anisotropy, a property of the magnetic field that gives it the ability to maintain a particular direction. Being able to measure magnetic anisotropy at the atomic level is a crucial step toward the magnet representing the ones or the zeroes used to store data in binary computer language.\nIn a second report, researchers at IBM's lab in Zurich, Switzerland, said they had used an individual molecule as an electric switch that could potentially replace the transistors used in modern chips. The company published both research reports in Friday's edition of the journal Science.\nThe new technologies are at least 10 years from being used for components in commercial products, but the discoveries will allow scientists to take a large step forward in their quest to replace silicon, said IBM spokesman Matthew McMahon.\nTo build faster, smaller chips, IBM and other chip vendors like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have shrunk the dimensions of chip features from 90 nanometers to 65nm in the current generation of chips and plan to continue to 45nm and 32nm in coming years. The problem is that wires built from silicon tend to leak more electricity at each step on that scale, and will eventually reach a limit where they are no longer useful.\n\"Across all our areas of nanotechnology research, we're trying to determine the new kinds of materials we can use in computing when silicon reaches its fundamental limits. The ultimate goal is molecular-level computers, but the interim products will probably be hybrids with current technology, using things like carbon nanotubes,\" McMahon said.\nIBM defines nanotechnology as work done at a scale of 100nm or smaller. At that scale, scientists must use a tool called the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to photograph and manipulate individual atoms, as they did in their latest research. Their next challenge is to find a way to make these laboratory demonstrations work at room temperature, he said.\nHaving measured the magnetic anisotropy of a single atom, \"their next step is finding atoms that can do it at stable temperatures that are suitable for storage devices. If they can find that, it's still a decade out from commercialization,\" he said.\nThe Zurich researchers also developed a technique for using a molecule containing two hydrogen atoms as a switch, either on its own or with an adjacent molecule. They are now looking to apply the method to many other molecules, enabling the system to work as a collection of logic gates, the building blocks of microprocessors.\nEven if the teams reach those goals, they must find a way to manufacture the systems on a large scale, instead of moving single atoms with the STM. One possibility is to use the process of self-assembly, where atoms under certain conditions will naturally form the desired shapes. In May, IBM said it had used that approach to insulate the wires on a chip by creating trillions of tiny, vacuum-filled holes around each one."}

Even though vodka cocktails come in a huge variety, most of them are filled to the brim with calories. However, you can create your own low-calorie vodka cocktail which is not only delicious but also won\u2019t break your diet chart.\nCocktails don\u2019t come much simpler than this. There are no calories in soda and water, so the only caloric content in this cocktail comes from the vodka. Don\u2019t just use any vodka, though. When the only other ingredients are water and soda, there is truly nowhere for a low-quality vodka to hide. Try one of the finest and smoothest vodka available in India, such as Red Bliss by Hermes. This particular vodka in India is smooth and makes a delicious version of the cocktail. Did you know vodka averages 96 calories per 1.5 ounces, making vodka soda a low-calorie cocktail?\nInfused vodkas offer a flavourful and interesting experience when drinking vodka straight. It also eliminates the need to add various traditional mixers like juice which have a high-calorie content. Flavored vodkas are the best cocktails without any extra calories, and nowadays, many brands of vodka offer infused varieties. Some of the most common infused vodkas sold include vanilla, lemon, berries and cucumber.\nBecause the calories in vodka tend to be pretty high, the only way to have a cocktail without a lot of calories is to be mindful of what you mix in with your beverage. Cranberry juice is one ingredient which is not just healthy but also incredibly delicious. This drink only has a total of 115 calories, so you can easily splurge on two glasses. Sugar is the main culprit for calories in vodka cocktails. Apart from cranberry juice, you can also use low-calorie mixers such as diet Coke, diet lemonade, diet iced tea, lime juice and other diet mixers that add zero calories to vodka. Most of these mixers are low in sugar or have switched out the sugar with a sweet substitute.\nThe gimlet is a cocktail usually made of gin, lime juice, and soda. When gimlet is added to a light mix of vodka, it is not only refreshing but also easy on the waistline. Gimlet is the perfect cocktail to sip on during summers as it\u2019s not just bright but also sour up front. The vodka\u2019s rather neutral flavor lets the fresh lime juice shine. Lime is an essential ingredient of this cocktail, so you need to ensure you use a ripe one when preparing Vodka Gimlet.\nA vodka martini is a delightful cocktail made with vodka and vermouth, a variation of a martini. It is prepared by combining vodka, dry vermouth and ice in a mixing glass or cocktail shaker. Even though vodka martini is incredibly boozy, it is also lower in sugar content than most cocktails of the same strength. The best thing you can do to make the healthiest version of your cocktail is garnished it with a lemon and a few olives.\nLow-calorie vodka drinks are tricky since most of them comprise of sugar-loaded juices and mixers. While making your own vodka cocktail at home, you should use the freshest ingredients, as bottled mixes and canned juices come loaded with added sugar. This defeats the entire purpose of what"}

So says the IAEA (eight separate certifications of compliance since the deal was struck in Vienna in 2015). So says the EU, Russia and China. So says even Trump's military troika -- Tillerson/McMaster/Mattis.\nNot Trump. Because, in his speechwriter's mind-boggling words, no deal is possible with a \"sinister,\" \"fanatical regime,\" the \"leading state sponsor of terrorism,\" in cahoots with al-Qaeda (check out this pearl; \"Iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al-Qaeda's bombing of the American embassies in Kenya, Tanzania.\") Not to mention \"some people\" even believe Iran is going illegally nuclear with the help of North Korea. That's straight out of season 6 of Homeland.\nAs much as it may be drenched in newspeak, the plot twist does not have much to do with \"decertifying\" -- in fact reneging -- the JCPOA. The White House admitted as much in a statement; \"The United States' new Iran strategy focuses on neutralizing the government of Iran's destabilizing influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants,\" as well as denying \"the IRGC funding for its malign activities.\"\nEnter, predictably, a new sanctions avalanche. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is preparing a new round of sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program. The Senate unanimously passed a Hezbollah sanctions bill less than two weeks ago. Earlier this year the House voted 419-3 and the Senate 98-2 to pass the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, post-JCPOA, also including North Korea and Russia (much to the ire of EU companies doing business with Russia). The Treasury Dept. has already added the IRGC to its anti-terrorism sanctions list \"for providing support to a number of terrorist groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as to the Taliban.\"\nOn the JCPOA, Trump passed the ball to Congress. De facto reneging the deal leads to a 60-day period for Congress to decide whether to restart JCPOA-related sanctions. Trump essentially wants Congress to make sure anything Tehran does, even outside the JCPOA, triggers automatic re-slapping of sanctions. It's unclear whether he has sufficient Congress support for such a gambit.\nUS allies will also be \"encouraged\" to reach what for all practical purposes is a non-denial denial renegotiation. This can be easily interpreted as unilateral extorsion. It's not gonna happen -- as the EU, Russia and China have made abundantly clear. Washington then will be de facto pulling out of the JCPOA.

{"idx": "33380", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In the summer of 2011 Facebook czar Mark Zuckerberg and former Googler Lars Rasmussen, who had joined the company about a year earlier, had a conversation about building a third \"pillar\" of Facebook.\nFacebook's Timeline is a snapshot of a person's life: Who they are, what they do, who their friends are, what they like. Newsfeed is a look into the latest happenings in each user's social network. Graph Search, introduced this week during a private unveiling at the company's headquarters, is a third pillar, Zuckerberg says. It is an advanced search that lets users type in what they're looking for and return results based on their distinctive social surroundings.\nBuilding such a search system is no trivial task. Facebook has 1 billion active users each month who have shared more than 240 billion photos. The social network is a complex web of more than 1 trillion connections of thousands of different types. \"Every day, people share billions of pieces of new content, and Graph Search needs those indexed within seconds of their creation,\" Rasmussen describes. So how did they do it?\nFacebook is fairly mum about its internal operations, although it does give some hints on the company's engineering Facebook page. Database experts, and even those who track Facebook closely don't even know for sure exactly how Facebook built Graph Search, but combining both structured and unstructured data into a unified search tool, which also takes into account the individual privacy settings of each user is undoubtedly a massive technical challenge.\n\"Searching a database on this scale is massively complex, with the key problem being how to search the entire database without degrading the performance of Facebook itself,\" says Matt Aslett, a data expert at the 451 Group. \"Add in the fact that Facebook is doing a graph search - which not only searches all the data but the relationships between the data - and it is very hard to do efficiently.\"\nGraph Search, Aslett believes, is likely based off of Facebook's internally-developed Tao database, a cached layer on top of Facebook's thousands of sharded MySQL databases, according to a blog post a Facebook engineer wrote last fall describing challenges related to working with cached content.\nTo create Graph Search, the engineers likely used some combination of open source tools that are available on the market, combined with internally-developed code written specifically for Facebook's extremely unique use case, predicts Jeffrey Kelly, big data expert at The Wikibon Project. Tools like Apache Lucene Solr and Cassandra- used by Netflix to index its movie library in Amazon Web Service's cloud. \"FB doesn't use straight off the shelf software and hardware,\" he says. They can't, they either customize open source technology or develops it in-house.\n\"None of us had built anything remotely like this before,\" Rasmussen says in describing the \"Under the hood\" details of Graph Search beta. No one had built something like Graph Search before because it's a completely new type of search tool, one designed specifically for use by a social network.\nTraditional search tools would not do the trick, Rasmussen says. \"Using traditional information-retrieval systems to mix keyword and structured queries is fairly well understood,\" he writes. But Graph Search needs to be able to return results that are more than just a single connection away, he says. And then there's the whole privacy angle. Engineers were able to design a system that combs through the data, but users have in many cases created explicit restrictions on who can see that information. Graph Search needs to ensure that it only creates results that have been shared with the search"}

The latter has just announced he is dying from incurable cancer. First, let's take a look at the founder of Heritage Foundation and his affiliations. Mr. Weyrich wielded such power, and had so many organizations, that I'm only able to skim the surface of his many involvements.\nPlease understand that I'm writing this series to make people aware that all those great sounding rightwing groups have hidden agendas and affiliations with the Communist left and the shadow government of the CFR. We must know our enemies. In doing so, we can counter their efforts with the truth.\nPaul M. Weyrich was born in 1942 and died in 2008. He was allegedly an American religious conservative and figurehead of the New Right. The latter has nothing to do with old-right Constitutional conservatives. The New Right is made up of neo-con Trotskyites and corporate fascists. They masquerade as \"moderate\" Republicans. See Part 3 of this series.\nWeyrich was the Grand Poobah of the Council for National Policy. He was on the CNP Board of Governors in 1982 and 1996, and was the CNP Secretary-Treasurer as well as being on the Executive Committee in 1984-1985 and 1988. The Executive Committee decides who can become a member, and who can be an invited guest. He co-founded the conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation, the Free Congress Foundation, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). He coined the term \"Moral Majority\", the name of the political action group Moral Majority that he co-founded in 1979 with fellow CNP charter member, Jerry Falwell.\nAs major founder of the Heritage Foundation, Paul Weyrich served as the first president in 1973-1974. Funding came from Joseph Coors, and Richard Mellon Scaife. Here is a list of Heritage's top funders today, along with their board of trustees. Note that Carthage Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, and Scaife Family Foundation are all Richard Mellon Scaife foundations. Here is Weyrich's own story of how he and Joe Coors worked together to create Heritage Foundation.\nIn 1971, Joseph Coors along with Jack Wilson and Paul Weyrich, founded Analysis and Research Inc., to establish a political research entity, that being Heritage Foundation. CNP member, Joe Coors donated the first-year Heritage budget of $250,000 for 1973 from the coffers of the Coors Corporation, and for the next two years gave $200,000. He then pledged $15,000 per month, but eventually gave more. Coors and Weyrich set up the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, which evolved into the Free Congress Foundation, to carry out political activities, and the Heritage Foundation as a tax exempt educational research entity.\nThe Coors company provided Heritage Foundation with $20,000 per month during the foundation's first year. Weyrich was Heritage president until February 28, 1974. The Free Congress Foundation Board of Directors included Weyrich who was an"}

For example, research out of Yale Law School suggests that when people form their opinions on contentious topics such as climate change or evolution, political or religious values trump knowledge of the concept.\nA study published in March in BioScience begs to differ, at least when it comes to evolution. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues measured participants' knowledge of evolutionary theory, as well as their acceptance of evolution as fact. They found a significant link between understanding the fine points of the theory and believing in it, regardless of religious or political identity.\nUnlike earlier research that involved only high school or college students, the demographics of the 1,100 subjects in the new study better approximated those of the overall U.S. population. The researchers also used more nuanced language in their questions to distinguish between subjects' intellectual grasp of evolution and their personal feelings toward it.

In theory, America\u2019s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants \u2014 as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action.\nIt is a brutally realpolitik approach that America\u2019s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war.\nAnd it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015.\nMr. Obama\u2019s gamble in that deal \u2014 the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office \u2014 was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy.\nBy taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State.\nIt did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran\u2019s nuclear material out of the country, Iran\u2019s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West.\nMonths before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord.\nThen came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and his vow to dismantle it.

{"idx": "33410", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: What Is Eating My Green Bean Buds?\nPest-free gardens yield abundant green beans.\n1 What Animal Pest Eats Bean Plants?\nMany gardeners -- and other creatures -- relish a crop of succulent green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). If garden pests feed on your plants' buds, you'll never experience your harvest. Suspects come in all sizes, and many aren't selective in their damage. However, a few pests do target green bean buds. Control starts with detective work to identify the culprit. Appropriate remedies help keep green bean buds and your coming harvest intact.\nWhen green bean buds disappear entirely, animals may be to blame. Several mammals enjoy tender buds and other young bean parts. Deer, rabbits and squirrels may dine selectively on tiny buds. Commercial repellent sprays dissuade these diners for a few days, but many are unsafe for food crops. Cayenne pepper sprays deter these pests, but also deflect pollinators that enhance green bean crops. Fencing to limit access to your garden -- including a top, if squirrels are to blame -- is the only long-term solution. Sprinkle a light coating of lime around the plants to capture an identifiable footprint and build your fence accordingly.\nSlow, progressive bud eating may signal corn earworms at work. Despite their name, they target green bean buds, flowers and leaves. The distinctive green-, yellow- or brown-striped larvae have short, dark bristles down their backs. Look for them at dusk or with a flashlight at night. Handpick the pests or treat with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Mix 2 to 4 teaspoons of Bt concentrate with 1 gallon of water in a garden sprayer. Spray all the plant thoroughly, so feeding earworms ingest Bt. Repeat weekly, if needed. Bt also kills larvae of other pod-boring bean pests. It kills beneficial caterpillars, too. Wear gloves, protective clothing and eye protection when working with Bt or other chemicals.\nWhen buds, flowers and young bean pods develop, lygus bugs soon follow. The greenish-brown adults have a yellow-green triangle on their back, and their light green nymphs resemble aphids. They particularly like green beans. Prevent lygus bug invasions by eliminating weedy hiding places around your garden. The adults overwinter in plant debris or uncultivated areas nearby, and then lay eggs that hatch nymphs that feed on developing buds and fruit. Target the nymph stage to treat this pest. Spray ready-to-use insecticidal soap to cover all the plant surfaces; the soap must contact the insect. Repeat weekly, as needed, up to the day of harvest. Insecticidal soap also treats piercing, sucking insects that may feed on green bean plants.\nSlimy slugs and snails prefer succulent, young plants and do serious damage to green beans and their buds. They often leave foliage tattered, but also feed on buds and young fruit. Most active at night and during cloudy days, slugs and snails leave a silvery, slimy trail in their wake. Water the area thoroughly, and then return with a flashlight after dark. Handpicking is effective, but requires diligence. An overturned melon (Cucumis melo) rind serves as slug bait and trap.

Up until then, U.S. passenger rail service was in decline, losing money to air travel and an ever-growing car culture. But, as Simon Van Zuylen-Wood writes for National Journal, Amtrak didn't exactly save the dream of viable American train travel. Instead, it has been bogged down in bureaucratic nightmares ever since.\nAll you've got to do is look around the world: People often underscore the inadequacy of American rail service with comparisons to train service in Europe or Asia. For instance, the Acela Express is the speediest train in the Americas, but its average of 68 miles per hour between Boston and Washington pales in comparison to the 154 mph average of a Spanish train running from Madrid to Barcelona. Even funding comparisons are depressing. While China will spend $128 billion this year on rail travel, Congress recently approved a paltry spending package that gives Amtrak just $1.4 billion per year. U.S. trains aren't the planet's premier railways\u2014not by a longshot.\nTo get the story on Amtrak's bedeviling history, funding fiascos, and disasters (rail lines between New Orleans and Florida were washed out by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and have never been restored), read Van Zuylen-Wood's excellent full article, which concludes with a chicken-and-the-egg question. Is there really no demand for trains, or does a lack of excellent train service prevent people from wanting a ride? Ultimately, he writes, U.S. rail service is a paradox: \"To get to the conservative dream of a privatized Amtrak, you would first have to pursue the liberal path of spending a massive amount of public money.\" Good luck with that one."}

Edward Albee\u2019s \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d \u2014 now on Broadway in an extraordinarily bone-chilling production from the director Joe Mantello featuring a trio of heart-stopping performances from Glenda Jackson, Laurie Metcalf and Alison Pill \u2014 roars out that argument. In unrelenting triplicate.\nPlenty of scribes have bemoaned the cruel absurdity of life. But his intimidating demeanor notwithstanding, the late, great Albee was the evangelical kind of absurdist, which might sound paradoxical but, in fact, explains a much-misunderstood writer who consistently focused on what American families could actually do about all the inevitable miseries of life, compounding exponentially with age. Be prepared is one. Love the moment, another. Raise your kids better than Albee was raised himself is a third.\n\u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d which is making its Broadway debut more than two decades after it won the Pulitzer Prize, is autobiography writ as a treatise on human decay.\nIn the first half of Mantello\u2019s intermissionless production, you witness the late-in-life thrashings of the 92-year-old character named A, here played by the 81-year-old Glenda Jackson, newly returned to the stage after a 23-year governmental sojourn as member of Parliament for the London constituency of Hampstead and Highgate, body and voice spectacularly recalibrated for theatrical action after all those years of twisting and shouting her disapproval from the back benches.\nA parody of the tyrannical, Jackson is the ultimate embodiment of a caustic character: part Lady Bracknell, part the Dowager Countess of Grantham and part an attack dog with a bite that gets turned on herself.\nHer caregiver, B, played by Laurie Metcalf, evinces the mix of schadenfreude, compassion and personal dread that anyone in their 50s understands so well, being as we have that brief and painful vista with the 360-degree view.\nMeanwhile, C (Alison Pill), a young estate lawyer, coldly judges, as the young feel empowered to do. Temporarily.\nFor C\u2019s comeuppance awaits. A has a life-changing event and, in the second half of the piece, we gradually intuit that all three of these women now are playing A at different stages of her life, even as an authorial figure lurks around her bed, a young man wondering what to do with mortality.\nThe device makes for the most delicious dramatic irony, the darkest depictions of how misery usually follows happiness, the disappointments that hollow out the expectations of youth. Whee!\nMantello\u2019s stunning production bulges out the vascularity of this fantastic play. Metcalf is a key weapon in his arsenal, because we immediately intuit her no-nonsense Midwestern humanity, thus leavening a common problem with this play, namely its WASPy chill.\nIt\u2019s hard to overpraise this linchpin of a performance.

The series also sees the live-action directorial debut of the writer and showrunner of the Star Wars animated series, Dave Filoni. A new post on Instagram from the show\u2019s writer and producer Jon Favreau, however, shows that Waititi is pulling double duty playing a droid in The Mandalorian.\nFavreau\u2019s post on his Instagram account shows Waititi doing voice-over work, with a droid on a screen. The droid in question is IG-88, a bounty hunter droid that first made its appearance in the Star Wars universe during the events of Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\nIG-88 is a droid that answers Darth Vader\u2019s bounty on the Millennium Falcon. The war-torn droid since then has become a fan-favorite character, and his appearance in The Mandalorian makes complete sense, given the show is about another famous Star Wars bounty hunter. More about IG-88 can be found on this StarWars.com story.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Waititi will be voicing the droid as a one-off, or if he will be the voice for the character throughout the first season. As The Inquisitr previously reported, Season 1 of The Mandalorian has wrapped filming, so the voice work seems to be happening as part of the post-production work.\nThe post shows Waititi in front of a few microphones, recording some dialogue, with a screen showing an image of the IG-88, with presumably the Skywalker watermark as well as the famous bounty hunter helmet, possibly to dress up the picture.

We saw uneven performances by a number of players, but there were some future stars who made plays to show that they have what it takes to impress NFL evaluators.\nWith that in mind, here are six players who caught the eyes of NFL Media analysts during Thursday's Senior Bowl practices for the North and South teams.\nMiami's Clive Walford has been the most impressive of the tight ends on either team, but Boyle, an under-the-radar pass-catcher, made some noise on Thursday to cap off a solid showing against top competition. He's the biggest player at the position and that shows during blocking drills, but he was able to turn in a terrific effort in the passing game on Thursday. \"He may have made the most money out of anybody,\" said NFL media analyst Daniel Jeremiah, who noted how quickly Boyle has gone from unknown to possible Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) draft pick.\nSamford's Jaquiski Tartt is the guy most evaluators had their eyes on this week among the small-school prospects, but it was Geathers who outshined most of the defensive backs on the South squad. A savvy veteran with many starts under his belt, he was able to read and react quicker than most. He also showed off the coverage skills evaluators want to see from guys that can roam around on the back end and also break to the line of scrimmage well on runs. \"He had a very nice week and good day today,\" said NFL Media analyst Charles Davis. \"Scouts I talked to are really buzzing about him.\"\nJust about every defensive end or tackle has shown up and made plays this week in practice, but it was Smith's turn to show off his potential on Thursday. He certainly has the size (6-5, 270) to play a number of spots along the line, but really showed up during team drills using his strength to make life difficult for headliners at offensive tackle like LSU's La'el Collins and Oklahoma's Daryl Williams.\nHall is one of a number of smaller wide receivers looking to impress this week, and he did just that with some nice catches in traffic on Thursday. More than anything, he's improved as the week progressed and it's always nice to have your best day when scouts are watching closely before they get out of town. He's not the fastest or biggest at the position, but he certainly flashed that he can be a player at the next level.\nCollege stars show off their skills in preparation for the 2015 Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala.\nThe Duke guard has been a fast-riser this whole week and put on yet another show in the one-on-one drills that you couldn't help but notice. He establishes such a good base and is so fundamentally sound that defensive linemen who don't have a plan to beat him often find themselves on the ground or well past the pocket. Even opposing defensive linemen unanimously said after practice that Tomlinson was the toughest player they faced among the North squad's offensive linemen.\nThe FBS leader"}

Sydney\u2019s geography may be spectacular, but it\u2019s bad for building housing. Ocean to the east, mountains to the west, and the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park to the north limit Sydney\u2019s urban sprawl. Whereas Melbourne can build more \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 housing on abundant greenfield land closer to the city.\nBut the rules of the game are shifting. Melbourne\u2019s urban fringe is a lot further from the city centre today than 30 years ago. Most new jobs in our services-based economy are being created in or close to the city centre, far from those new homes. And relying on greenfield housing to accommodate most of our booming population is causing other problems: more traffic congestion, longer commutes and a big drop in the quality of family and social life.\nThe surging demand for housing, driven by low interest rates and strong population growth, has sent house prices skyrocketing. Melbourne\u2019s population grew by 126,000 in 2016, much faster than 94,000 per year as forecast in the state government\u2019s 2017 Plan Melbourne. Melbourne is projected to grow to 8 million people by 2050, or roughly the size of London today. Melbourne needs a new housing game plan if it\u2019s going to keep up.\nIt should follow Sydney\u2019s lead by reforming planning rules to encourage home building in middle suburbs already well serviced by infrastructure and with good access to the city and its jobs. Sydney has added 60,000 new apartments in middle-ring suburbs in the past four years, mostly in buildings of four-to-nine-storeys. And this building boom is starting to pay dividends: Sydney house prices have fallen 4 per cent in the past six months.\nIn contrast, only 25,000 new apartments were built in Melbourne\u2019s middle-ring suburbs over the past four years. Melbourne is getting the mix wrong. Too much of the new housing is CBD high-rises of 20 storeys or more.\nPopulation density in the middle rings of Melbourne has barely changed in 30 years. We need to fill in the ''missing middle''. That means the state government will have to make it easier to build and redevelop in Melbourne\u2019s inner and middle-ring suburbs. Our new report, Housing affordability: re-imagining the Australian dream, shows what needs to be done.\nFewer small-scale urban infill projects should require council planning approval. We recommend a new small redevelopment housing code that would protect neighbours, reduce planning uncertainty, and improve the quality of new developments. The code would include the things that worry neighbours most, such as privacy, height, overshadowing of their outdoor areas, and the appearance of new developments from the street. It would cover developments that provide two-to-10 new dwellings in one- or two-storey developments. And it would apply to all residential areas, unless there are heritage or environmental restrictions. Sydney has shown the way: a similar fast-track development process covered 40 per cent of all residential development applications in Sydney in 2016, up from 3 per cent in 2008.\nThe Victorian government should also allow denser development ''as of right'' along key transport corridors, with height limits set up front. One recent study found that allowing four- to eight-storey buildings along"}

But he does know Walters\u2014indeed, the two are friendly, and socialize a couple of times a year (Icahn makes trips to Vegas and has business interests there).\nThat relationship seems to be the crux of the case that prosecutors would like to build around Icahn, which begins three years ago back in 2011, when the billionaire activist investor got interested in the consumer goods company Clorox. By February of that year, Icahn had built up a 9.1 percent stake in the company, and in July of the same year, he announced an unsolicited takeover bid. According to news reports about the investigation, just a few days before that bid, both Walters and Mickelson made big money trading Clorox. The question is, did Icahn tip Walters, who then tipped Mickelson, whom he ran into occasionally on the golf circuit (Walters owns a course)?\nIcahn and Walters certainly chatted about stocks\u2014Icahn talks about stocks with everyone. But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely that Icahn, who\u2019s one of the savviest investors around, would have knowingly given Walters insider information that would have compromised his multi-decade career and put him in the line of fire of regulators eager to bring down a big Wall Street fish. I think what\u2019s much more likely is that Walters was a close listener, and observer, of Icahn. Walters, like many people close to Icahn (and even more who don\u2019t know him personally at all), followed what he was doing in the markets. When they met, in Vegas or elsewhere, they\u2019d sometimes talk about stocks. But that in itself isn\u2019t illegal\u2014in fact, under insider trading laws, it\u2019s not even illegal to tell someone that you are planning to trade a stock, unless it breaches a duty of confidentiality to your own investors (which doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case here, but that\u2019s a legal matter that still has to be teased out).\nIn the end, Icahn never completed the tender offer for Clorox. But anyone who follows his career knows that he often buys up a lot of a stock before ultimately trying to gain a board seat or even buy the company. It\u2019s not exactly a stealth strategy. And all of those moves typically drive up the price of the stock in question. That\u2019s exactly why people follow his moves and try to buy what he does. It\u2019s possible that Walters was a good observer of that behavior, and it\u2019s also possible that Icahn may have talked up his interest in Clorox to him in the run up to his buyout offer. But I\u2019m disinclined to think that this is a guy who\u2019d risk an iconic career by giving illegal insider tips to anyone. It will be interesting to see how this investigation shapes up. Icahn claims he has yet to be contacted by any of the authorities. \u201cWe are always very careful to observe all legal requirements in all of our activities,\u201d he told me.\nYou can bet that prosecutors will be looking closely in the coming weeks and months to make sure that every i has been dotted."}

Instead, hundreds who attended the protests, including journalists and photographers who were covering the events, have been arrested and are facing an unfair mass trial. This vacuum of justice has allowed security forces to commit serious human rights violations, including using excessive lethal force and carrying out enforced disappearances, entirely unchecked.\n\u201cPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sissi\u2019s regime has been determined to wipe out all memory of the massacre of the summer of 2013. The dark legacy of this failure to bring anyone to justice is that Egypt\u2019s security forces today feel that they will not be held accountable for committing human rights violations,\u201d said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.\nSince 2015, at least 1,700 people are estimated to have been \u201cdisappeared\u201d by state agents for periods ranging from a few days to up to seven months.

Egyptian security forces have also carried out dozens of extrajudicial executions.\nThe Egyptian government\u2019s efforts to erase all memory of the 2013 massacres appear to have had some impact. In August 2013, following the excessive use of lethal force by security forces at Rabaa, the EU Foreign Affairs Council agreed to suspend export licenses to Egypt of any equipment which could be used for internal repression. Despite this, many EU member states have continued to supply the country with arms and policing equipment. The latest EU country report published last month also makes no mention of the Rabaa massacre or the impunity security services still enjoy.\nor death, after grossly unfair trials.

Instead of offering justice and remedy for victims, they have helped shield perpetrators from prosecution.\n\u201cThe level of disparity between the rampant impunity enjoyed by security forces who took part in the Rabaa dispersal on one hand, and the mass persecution of Muslim Brotherhood supporters who participated in protest as well as journalists reporting that day, is shocking,\u201d said Najia Bounaim.\nAccording to official statistics, six security officers were killed during the Rabaa dispersal and three during the al-Fateh protest two days later, also in Cairo.

Its flagship product, Wind/U, was designed to let companies port applications from Windows to Unix, and Bristol had been privy to Windows source code it needed to make Wind/U.\nHowever, Microsoft decided to stop providing Bristol with the complete source code and thus illegally used its OS monopoly power to undermine the competing Unix market, Bristol has alleged. Microsoft has maintained that the matter is a contractual -- rather than an antitrust -- dispute.\nMicrosoft yesterday issued a statement saying it was pleased by Hall's denial of the request for a preliminary injunction.\nIn its own statement about the ruling, Bristol said the judge's memorandum of decision foreshadows victory for Bristol.\n\"The judge recognised that Bristol has made an important contribution to the viability of Unix as a competitor to Windows NT,\" said Patrick Lynch, partner at O'Melveny & Myers and lead counsel for Bristol, in the statement. \"We believe a jury will agree that Microsoft has abused its monopoly power.\"\nMicrosoft -- which has been fighting a much larger antitrust battle in a case lodged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and 19 states -- said that Bristol has waged the suit as a tactic for a better licensing contract.\n\"This litigation was an effort by a company to use a lawsuit and a long-planned public relations campaign to try to gain better terms in its contract negotiations with Microsoft,\" said Steve Aeschbacher, senior corporate attorney for Microsoft, in the Microsoft statement.\nWhile Microsoft argued in the district court that Bristol is not a competitor to Microsoft, Bristol's statement included several quotations from Judge Hall's decision including: \"Based on the evidence before it at this time, the court finds that Bristol has clearly shown that it is indeed a competitor of Microsoft -- Bristol has thus shown a substantial likelihood that it will be able to prove antitrust injury at trial ....

According to Massolution\u2019s Crowdfunding Industry Report, crowdfunding is posed to surpass venture capital funding by the end of 2016. As of 2015, global crowdfunding already had reached $34.4 billion.\nThat\u2019s good news for anyone looking to take a company to the next level quickly, and without the tedious process of nailing down traditional funding. But what kind of impact could crowdfunding really have on your company?\nHere\u2019s a look at the good ways crowdfunding is affecting the future of startups, and how to succeed at snagging your funding.\n1. It's prompted lightning-fast startup funding.\nGetting angel funding is a difficult, time-consuming process that can take months to secure and finalize. It\u2019s not uncommon to receive an initial investment of about $25,000, depending on your business and the angel investors involved. That probably won&apos;t get you too far when it comes to building and scaling a business from scratch, though.\nSecuring a business loan can be equally daunting, with applicants frequently facing high interest rates and plenty of rejections.\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at crowdfunding. Your company could raise a few thousand -- or a few million -- in a matter of weeks.\nAccording to Indiegogo, the average length of a crowdfunding campaign is between 30 and 39 days long. And while it&apos;s not the norm for businesses to raise millions on platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, it&apos;s still possible. Take a look at Pebble Time. The smartwatch maker raised $20,338,986 and reached a staggering 4,068 percent of its goal. Whether that\u2019s an anomaly or not, those kinds of figures don\u2019t come from traditional funding.\nNew technologies and processes can disrupt long-standing industries, but funding hasn\u2019t really been part of that disruption. Crowdfunding took the startup world by storm as it connected everyday people with companies trying to bring a product or service to market.\nThat concept has since evolved. Today, the lending industry is in a process of disruption, as sites like Lending Club offer alternative options for people looking to fund everything from student loans to personal projects.\nOther industries are also changing as a direct result of crowdfunding. Realty Mogul crowdfunds commercial real estate investments, an industry that hasn\u2019t really changed much over the last several decades. Whereas traditional commercial real estate investments require hundreds of thousands or millions, Realty Mogul requires as little as $5,000 to get started.\n3. It offers instant feedback.\nEntrepreneurs often get carried away with their business ideas and sink money into equipment, beta testing and expensive prototypes before they truly understand the market demand.\nCrowdfunding offers an opportunity to find out exactly what your core audience thinks before you spend a dime. You may end up adjusting your business and creating something even better, with a stronger unique selling proposition.\nDrawing up some simple sketches or putting together a design, working on compelling copy and offering your crowdfunders some great incentives like free products and shout-outs is free. Meanwhile, the feedback your audience gives you on your business and model is invaluable. You may find your business has no real traction or has some serious flaws. Your ego might take a bruising"}

Weill, who is reportedly interested in starting a private equity fund, had earlier committed to staying on as chairman until April 2006.\nStrategy-driven HR: Reality or Goal?\nIf you look at the history of HR, says James Walker, a consultant on strategic human resources based in La Jolla, Ca., trends in HR \u2014 such as outsourcing, the establishment of call centers and service centers, and the integration of work-life balance issues \u2014 usually require about a decade to take hold.\nAccording to Mark Bieler, a human resources consultant who was executive vice president of HR at Bankers Trust from 1985 to 1999, \u201cwithout the direct tie to strategy, there is no context for HR work. You have to be completely focused on aligning HR practice, policies and procedures to the overall strategy of the organization.\u201d In the mid-1980s, when Bieler was at Bankers Trust, chairman Charles Sanford converted the company from a commercial bank to an investment bank \u2014 \u201cabout as radical a cultural shift as one could imagine,\u201d says Bieler. \u201cMy role was taking a set of HR practices that I had inherited and making sure they were consistent with where we were trying to take the firm.

Moves billed as \u201cworkforce productivity,\u201d such as reducing overtime, are expected to save $250 million a year.\nEducation spending is set to rise by 1.2%, but that growth is largely due to higher student enrolment, instead of new programs. Ontario recently announced a host of education changes, including larger high school class sizes, which sparked widespread anger.\nThe post-secondary sector will see funding cuts, with spending dropping 1% on average for the next three years, largely due to changes to student financial assistance.\nUniversities and colleges will also see more conditions on their money, with up to 60% of post-secondary funding tied to institutional performance over the next five years. The government could not specify what criteria will be used to evaluate performance, saying it will work with institutions to develop them.\nChanges such as social assistance reforms, closing spaces and facilities in the youth justice system, and \u201cstreamlining\u201d administration are expected to help reduce children\u2019s and social services sector costs by $1 billion\u2014or two%\u2014over three years.\nThe justice sector is expected to see about 2% in cost cuts too, including changes to legal aid and victim compensation services and amalgamating adjudicative tribunals.\nFor businesses, faster write-offs on capital investments are expected to provide $3.8 billion in corporate tax relief over six years.

Jerry Brown signed a bill on Monday that grants agricultural workers long-awaited overtime pay.\nBrown, a fourth-term governor and longtime champion of union rights, signed the contentious bill less than two weeks after the Legislature sent it to his desk.\nUnder Assembly Bill 1066, California will become the first state to mandate overtime pay to farmworkers who work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours per week. The new overtime laws will be phased in incrementally until 2022 and the governor has the ability to stall the law depending on the state\u2019s budget outlook.\nCalifornia is one of few states to require overtime pay to farmworkers as currently they receive premium pay for working more than 10 hours in a day or 60 hours a week.\nA similar bill was defeated by the Legislature in June, but it was revived by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego. Gonzalez included amendments allowing the overtime laws to be phased in and the bill cleared the Legislature by a 44-32 vote in August.\nGonzalez worked with the United Farm Workers, the agricultural labor union founded by Cesar Chavez in 1962, to push the bill through the Legislature. The union coordinated support rallies and sent hundreds of farmworkers to pack the statehouse during the critical August Assembly hearings.\nSupporters touted AB 1066 as a human rights issue while the state\u2019s agricultural interests painted the proposal as a job killer. The overtime bill narrowly passed the Legislature along mostly party-lines in the Democratic-controlled house Assembly.\nCalifornia grower associations and several state Republicans warned that the new overtime laws would likely cause a surge in produce prices and cost some farmworkers their jobs. The opponents predicted that farmers would cut back workers\u2019 hours rather than pay them costly overtime wages.\nAssemblyman James Gallagher, R-Yuba City, reacted to the signing by blasting the Democrats for pushing AB 1066 through. Gallagher represents one of Northern California\u2019s most productive farming regions.\n\u201cThe ruling party placated to one union group and the chronic and ignorant misconceptions of a few legislators who have no understanding of the industry and its people. If you understand agriculture, you know that this new law will result in lost wages for farm workers,\u201d Gallagher said in a statement.\nBrown, who previously marched with Chavez and signed the historic Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975 that guaranteed bargaining rights and overtime laws for farmworkers, did not issue a signing message Monday."}

With that changing trend, this election season polling places like Gallup worked cell-phone calls into its repertoire to get a better reflection of society, Gallup spokesperson Frank Newport told Wired's Mat Honan. And, logically, as more people replace landlines for cell phones, polling would increasingly throw cell-phones into the mix. But, it doesn't look like that's really the next frontier in polling. For one, it's expensive. A 1996 Federal regulation requires that calls to cell phones be hand-dialed, rather than computer generated, which costs more money because employing people (rather than machines) takes dollars, notes Bits Blog's Quentin Hardy. Plus, because of caller-ID, guilting cell phone users into taking a poll proves harder than haranguing an unsuspecting land-line answerer. (Of course, many land-line owners have caller-ID, too.) So, if the annoying, always disruptive at the worst time, pollster phone call is on the outs, then what does the future of political polling hold?\nFor real. The amateur-looking website conducted a series of polls throughout this election period, at times with better accuracy than the over-the-phone guys. In an explanatory post on the site, the company explains it had 96 percent accuracy with its methods. Over 60,000 people took one of the site's surveys the day before election day alone, SurveyMonkey's vice president, Philip Garland, told Hardy.\nThough some have questioned the accuracy of the online poll because of its newness to the field. Nate Silver, whose words on all things polling we should now consider law, confirmed that many of the most accurate polling came from online surveys. \"When people are asked questions by a person, they feel like they should make a choice,\" Garland added. People are more candid on the Internet, which is not at all surprising.\nThough a new survey says that text messaging is on the decline, Gallup is already experimenting with it as a polling technique in Central and South America, notes Honan. Though it doesn't sound that different than screening a phone call, text messages are a lot less invasive and they don't require an answer right away. Also, increasingly, it is how people do much of their communicating.\nThough that sounds logical since so many Americans are accessible by email, it turns out it is too hard to get a good sample using email, since many people have multiple email addresses, and it's hard to account for that difference. Also, isn't it just so easy to click delete without opening? However, that hasn't stopped certain organizations from using it, as Bloomberg Businessweek's Peter Coy explains. Some firms use email lists that aren't representative of the general population, he notes."}

Yes, He is on a quest to find believers who dream dreams at any cost, have a discerning spirit to properly interpret the times and who learn to intercede out of a posture of revelation. Where are the Josephs and Daniels for this generation? Perhaps some of them are those reading this message studying to show yourself approved as a workman for God.\nFrom the Life of Joseph\u2014Gen. 40:8\u2014\"And they said to him, 'We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter for it.'

And Daniel had understanding in all kinds of visions and dreams. ...

To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.\"\nSummation \u2013 What God did before, He wants to do again!\nAs dreams, visions and revelations are full of symbolism, they need to be viewed much the same as parables. Ask the Lord to show you the central issue. When dreams, etc. are broken down into too many details, the meaning becomes increasingly obscure. Frame it out like a giant jigsaw puzzle and the rest of the pieces will fall into place and the picture will be seen.\nDreams are often the language of emotions and therefore contain much symbolism. We must learn to take our interpretations first from Scripture and then from our own life. How God spoke in Genesis will be similar to the symbols and types in the book of Revelation. This holds true in our own lives as well.\nThe first place to look is in Scripture. The Bible is full of parables and allegories from which to draw types, shadows and symbols\u2014examples such as the mustard seed being faith, incense being the prayers of the saints, seed representing the \"Word of God,\" and the candlesticks being the church.\nSecondarily, dream symbols are often colloquial expressions which fill our memory bank. They become turned into pictorial language by the Holy Spirit. God takes the \"sayings and idioms\" and uses them to speak spiritual truth. An example is Gideon in Judges 7:9-15, where a barley cake appears. Gideon grew up as a thresher of wheat and barley. The barley cake therefore was a symbol from his colloquial spiritual alphabet with distinct meaning to him.\nThe third realm of symbols comes from our own personal revelatory alphabet.

This question, simple as it is, gave me pause. Firstly, because I had not thought about NPD in this way. Secondly, because there are so many answers to it.\nYet, having a clear vision of NPD process provides an aim for progressive improvement and refinement. Whatever we say about our NPD processes now, we can be sure that we will say something different in the future. Both business strategy and information technology (IT) systems capabilities continually drive change in our methods of developing and bringing our products to market.\nDo I dare take a moment now to try to answer the question of what great NPD looks like? Yes, because while the exact wording is not so important, the concepts are critical. I began by thinking about those concepts and quickly came up with a list.\n\u2022 Transparency: NPD does not \u201cget in the way,\u201d and it should also be lean.\n\u2022 Flexibility and adaptability: NPD needs to change.\n\u2022 NPD should support the corporate strategy, whatever that may be -- transformation, market leader, disruptor, number two player, etc.\n\u2022 NPD should support the desired corporate culture: open vs. closed, collaborative vs. transactional, etc.\n\u2022 NPD needs to motivate the organization.\n\u2022 NPD should provide and drive effective and efficient decision making.\n\u2022 NPD needs to be measurable and should deliver measurable results.\nA great NPD capability and process is one that supports the corporate strategy and business model, motivates the organization to excel and achieves measurable, well-defined and understood outcomes. The process needs to be flexible and adaptable so it can change as the organization learns and grows, and it needs to align well with the desired culture.\nA great NPD capability and process is one that is embedded in the culture, understood from top to bottom and is adopted cross-functionally in the execution of corporate strategy.\nThese vision statements are similar, yet slightly different. When I ran these by a few colleagues and peers, the reactions were mixed. Some liked the key statements of measurement and adaptability in the first version. Others favored the simple, to-the-point focus of the second. Whichever your preference, spend a moment to consider the key drivers of change behind a version of the vision statement that would work for you and your organization.\nChanging business strategy: Competition, technology and power of the consumer are driving rapid changes to business strategy and often necessitate business transformation.\nChanging IT systems capabilities: Advancing IT systems capability is enabling new ways of working. We have moved from loosely organized documents and spreadsheets in file folders to databases and NPD process specific software and are now moving to analytics, AI and machine learning.\nBoth of these drivers of change provide significant opportunity to improve our NPD process as well as a vision of what a great NPD capability and business process looks like."}

They traveled to the Tanner Clinic in Murray every Monday, where they gave him micrograms of diluted peanut extract under his tongue. Then, they increased his dose over time.\n\u201cThe 50 to 100 patients that have been recorded in publications have never had evidence of an anaphylactic event,\u201d said Dr. Rafael Firszt, an allergist with the Tanner Clinic.\nApplying doses under the tongue is called sublingual immunotherapy, or SLIT. Firszt says it\u2019s a good option for patients who\u2019ve had severe reactions in the past.\n\u201cIf a parent was really nervous about doing oral immunotherapy, this might be a nice option to potentially bridge to oral immunotherapy,\u201d Firszt said.\nSLIT desensitizes the body more slowly than oral immunotherapy, or OIT. Peanut extract is absorbed under the tongue, rather than swallowed.\nBut SLIT can be a bridge to OIT, which is what James did. After finishing SLIT, he took the treatment orally.\n\u201cThere are essentially two phases to the desensitization,\u201d Kobernick said.

In the event of a nuclear attack, the thrusters would be relied on to steer interceptors into the paths of enemy warheads, destroying them.\nIf a thruster malfunctioned, an interceptor could fly off-course and miss its target, with potentially disastrous consequences. The interceptors are the spine of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD, the nation's primary protection against a missile strike by North Korea or Iran.\nThe problem affecting the thrusters came to light as a result of the system's most recent flight test, on Jan. 28, 2016, when an interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The test was designed to show whether a redesign of the thrusters had solved persistent problems with the component.\nIt did not go as planned. One of the interceptor's four thrusters shut down during the test, causing the interceptor to veer far from its intended course.\nThe U.S. Missile Defense Agency and its lead GMD contractors nevertheless touted the exercise as a success, making no mention of the malfunction.

The \"most likely\" explanation, the panel said, was that a \"foreign object\" in the interceptor's internal guidance module came loose, fell onto the board and caused a short circuit.\nOf the GMD system's 37 operational interceptors, 34 are equipped with older circuit boards vulnerable to the same kind of incident, according to missile defense specialists, including former and current government officials.\nThe missile agency is in the midst of expanding GMD to a planned total of 44 interceptors by the end of this year. The 10 newest interceptors will have circuit boards made with \"improved manufacturing processes,\" an agency spokesman said.\nBut agency officials do not plan to retrofit or repair the older circuit boards, which were manufactured differently. Spokesman Christopher Johnson, in written responses to questions from The Times, said that based on the review board's analysis, \"no corrective actions are needed.\"\nIndependent missile defense experts, however, said the review board's findings signal a weakness in the 34 older interceptors, which now make up more than 90% of the fleet.

Good advice, but the greater sense of loss for Liverpool followers might be the knowledge that just a couple of seasons ago this fixture was practically a title decider. Now it is just a north-west derby. While City still look the team to beat for anyone with designs on the title, Liverpool look more like Everton.

There are just the core four north-west clubs remaining now \u2013 two in Manchester and two on Merseyside \u2013 and if one wished to take the positive view it seems safe to say there appears no immediate danger of the number being depleted any further.\nJust as well perhaps, since Blackpool and Wigan dropped two divisions when they began to go down, the former becoming embroiled in what has been accurately described as a civil war with its own supporters. While Blackburn and Bolton have avoided that fate so far, Neil Lennon\u2019s side have been stuck near the bottom of the Championship for most of the season and Blackburn have just changed managers in the hope of pulling away from the relegation zone. Thank goodness for Burnley, who at least may be a success story at the top end of the Championship, though should Turf Moor win itself another Premier League season there seems no reason to expect a longer or more successful visit than last time.\nNot that the north-west as a region has any God-given right to top-flight football, you understand. It was a bit of a throwback five years ago when clubs more famous for their exploits in black and white cine reels began to form a majority in the supposedly brave new world of the Premier League, though looking back it was just a blip, nothing more. A couple of seasons ago there was the novelty of two trips to south Wales on the Premier League calendar, but that did not last long either.\nLooking at the table, as things stand the novelty of two trips to the south coast is also under threat, though few imagined Bournemouth would be able to take root in the top division at the first attempt. What is a little more surprising is that Sunderland and Aston Villa are beneath Eddie Howe\u2019s new boys, and Newcastle are only above them courtesy of their only away win of the season so far, at Bournemouth a fortnight ago. Otherwise Newcastle and Bournemouth have the same number of wins, two each from 12 games.\nSunderland and Villa have just one apiece, while Chelsea have managed only one more.\nNo one seriously imagines Chelsea will be relegated though.

From actively managed funds to government bonds and cash, suitability is the watchword.\nIf you\u2019re unsure of your investment needs, it\u2019s always wise to seek professional help. But here are a few of the most important questions to think about when deciding on the right risk profile for your investments.\nFor very long-term investors \u2013 someone in their 30s putting money away for retirement, for example \u2013 higher allocations to riskier assets like stocks will be more suitable than for short-term savers. The reason, as Fidelity\u2019s Tom Stevenson told City A.M. earlier this year, is that over long time horizons, the number of years in which equities outperform cash and bonds gets close to 100 per cent. As observers of markets this year will know, there\u2019s likely to be plenty of bumps along the way \u2013 the FTSE 100 is now down almost 5.3 per cent year-to-date, having been close to all-time highs mere months ago.\nBut the longer you\u2019re saving for, the less these price swings will matter. Of course, the opposite is true for short-term savers. Even someone who considers themselves an adventurous investor should take a cautious approach if they\u2019re saving for a house deposit in a few years\u2019 time, says Thomas Diaper of Plutus Wealth, since there\u2019s a chance that their investments will fall in value just before the money is needed.\nHOW HIGH A RETURN DO I NEED?\nThe next thing to think about, according to Danny Cox of Hargreaves Lansdown, is whether you require a specific rate of return to meet your investment goals. It sounds obvious, but a low-risk portfolio is unlikely to be able to provide returns of between 5 and 10 per cent per annum. And if your investment goals require relatively rapid capital growth over a number of years, Cox says, there\u2019s no alternative to taking on slightly higher risk. Again, the inverse holds for an investor not trying to hit an ambitious target.\nHOW MUCH VOLATILITY CAN I HANDLE?\nThis one splits into two related questions. The first is psychological: is a sharp bout of market volatility likely to have you in cold sweats, or are you made of stronger stuff? In one sense, risk profiles are extremely personal and subjective, says Diaper. Some are happy to open themselves up to the possibility of sharp falls in the value of their portfolios, while others would find the high volatility levels of a riskier portfolio too stressful, preferring to keep their money in government bonds or cash. The majority of us are somewhere in between. Companies like Oxford Risk offer psychometric testing to help establish where you fall on the scale.\nBut Diaper points out that sometimes the results of these tests contradict an investor\u2019s stated objectives, and it\u2019s difficult to separate psychological risk aversion from the second, related issue of an investor\u2019s financial capacity to handle volat"}

CLF took in $26 million in 2017, compared with $497,000 in 2015, the previous year without an election.\nThe haul comes ahead of 2018 midterm elections in which majority House Republicans hope to limit potential losses partly driven by President Donald Trump's low approval ratings. Democrats have led Republicans by more than 10 points in an average of recent ballots that ask voters to choose between a generic member of both parties in 2018, according to RealClearPolitics.\nThe party in control of the White House \u2014 in this case the GOP \u2014 has often struggled in its first congressional midterm election following a presidential race.\n\"CLF's record-setting off-year fundraising is a testament to Speaker Ryan's leadership and House Republicans' conservative agenda,\" Executive Director Corry Bliss said in a statement. \"Knowing history is against us, CLF's field program has laid the groundwork to protect the Republican House majority well ahead of Election Day, opening 27 field offices and making over 5 million voter contacts to date.\"\nPolitico first reported the groups' fundraising haul.\nBig-money donors in recent days have raised the stakes for the Nov. 6 elections, which will help to determine how much of the GOP's sprawling agenda it can pass while Trump is in office. On Monday, billionaire Democratic activist Tom Steyer announced he would put $30 million into a group designed to boost young voter turnout in key races in 10 states, largely targeting seats controlled by Republicans.\nSteyer has already put a reported $20 million of his own money into an effort calling on Democrats to impeach Trump if they win the House majority.\nOn Monday night, the Congressional Leadership Fund disclosed more than $100,000 in spending to set up a \"ground game\" in western Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District. A special election there in March will determine who replaces Tim Murphy, who resigned from Congress in October.\nRepublicans hold a 239 to 193 seat advantage in the House. Three seats are empty after member resignations.\nIn coming months, Republicans hope to build public support for their tax overhaul, which went into law in december.

Laguna is strictly Spanish with no enchilada interlopers.\nA discreet wooden sign at the entrance reads ''quiet dining inside.'' This reassurance may be for those fearing another Heads and Tails or for those who peek through the window and see only the bar upfront. The dining room in the rear is spacious and sedate. Quiet dining indeed. Tables are graced with fresh flowers and candles. Walls hold a few pictures of San Sebastian (the chef's hometown in the Basque region of Spain), jewel-toned tapestries, lovely Spanish pottery and shelves with cascading green plants. Views of the Roslyn duck pond, for which the restaurant is named, compete with the decor for attention.\nThe staff is large, attentive and very friendly. Throughout the room, diners can be heard practicing their high school Spanish, much to their waiter's delight.\nPaella is not the only good choice. The grilled red snapper anointed with olive oil, sauteed garlic slices, vinegar and parsley was perfect, as was the juicy grilled chicken breast set atop a crunchy nest of straw potatoes, accompanied by grilled eggplant and other vegetables.\nSteaks, too, were striking. The flavorful sirloin arrived with sauteed pimientos and french fries. The filet mignon in Port wine was perfectly turned out, as were rosy baby lamb chops with cassis sauce and chestnut puree, and fork-tender veal medallions, each napped with a different sauce, which encircled a mound of cubed fried potatoes.\nThe menu's highest-priced entree, shrimp in a Champagne and mushroom cream sauce over fettuccine ($22.95), starred large, firm crustaceans but needed a dash of salt to bring it to life.\nThe wonderful soups here need no additional seasoning. The bursting-with-flavor bisque of fall vegetables and the creamy zucchini brew arrive in large bowls with a garnish of croutons. The Basque fish soup is a mahogany colored puree with token bits of seafood as a garnish.\nOther openers to try are the earthenware casserole filled with spicy shrimp in garlic sauce, the lightly dressed green salad made with arugula and highlighted with black olives, and the tender grilled calamari perched upon a tasty black ink sauce. Two also-rans were the somewhat watery white asparagus presented with mayonnaise and a pimiento-dotted vinaigrette, and the pastry stuffed with crab meat. The latter, which resembled flat crepes, enclosed a nondescript filling that could have been anything.\nDesserts are works of art, expensive ($6.75 to $8.50) and unusual. My favorite was the fried custard, creamy-centered with a crisp exterior, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Also different was the mascarpone tart with blackberry sauce. This translated to a swirled mound of the creamy cheese punctuated with a shortbread cookie. Pastry stuffed with almond and vanilla custard"}

He owns three late 1970s-era highrise properties in Toronto \u2014 the two towers at the Weston Rd. location, an apartment building on Lansdowne Ave. and Dupont St., and two highrise towers on Kipling Ave.\nAs a landlord, Barrasso seems to have turned over a new leaf \u2014 with some government help.\nNow the city of Toronto is running community programming for tenants and local residents in a portion of the 6,500 square feet of amenity space at his Weston Rd. property.\nThe sewing hub is part of a broad program the city recently launched in some privately owned buildings across the city as well as Toronto Community Housing properties.

South Africa\u2019s Sasol also announced it would shelve an $11 billion gulf coast gas-to-liquid plant.\nAndrew Logan, an analyst at sustainability-focused investor group Ceres, said such moves by a company to recommend an activist group\u2019s resolution is rare and reflects the pressure placed on Shell to address climate change.\nLogan said, however, that Shell is likely to face more investor scrutiny because of its decision to move ahead on drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic.\n\u201cInvestors will be watching closely to see how the company explains that decision in light of the concerns raised in the shareholder proposal that Shell itself now says it supports,\u201d Logan said.\nBarrister Elspeth Owens of shareholder group ClientEarth, which assisted with the filing of the resolution, said the Shell decision \u201cthrows down the gauntlet for BP,\u201d which received the same resolution by Aiming for A earlier in January."}

They rejected it on Thursday, demanding an amendment to the nation-state law addressing all minorities in Israel.\nSpeaking at the start of the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu defended the purpose of the controversial legislation, saying: \"Individual rights are anchored in many laws.

Underneath my own Apple Thunderbolt Display I have an external hard drive lying around. And on certain occasions, I\u2019ll even have two drives connected, totally destroying the Feng Shui of my neat Apple workspace.\nFortunately, the BackPack 2 Shelf tackles that problem by providing you with a sturdy shelf that can be used at the front or backside of your display\u2019s base. The BackPack 2 Shelf is made to match the Apple Display and iMac to a T. The shelf itself is just the right size to hold a portable drive, a USB peripheral, business cards, an iPhone, a camera, and what not. As a matter of fact, it can hold up to 3.5lbs of peripherals. It can even hold a MacBook Air or Mac Mini. The BackPack 2 Shelf comes with adjustable clips and vertical support pegs that allow it to be placed at any height along the back of the stand. The whole process of setting up the shelf just took a few minutes.\nThe BackPack 2 Shelf is actually a second generation product. One of its new features is that it can now be used as a front-facing shelf too. Additionally, you can even hang up to two BackPack 2\u2019s at once.\nTwelveSouth\u2019s BackPack 2 retails for $34.99.\nIf you\u2019re an iMac user with a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air hooked up to your display, then you know just want I\u2019m talking about. Until now, I have had my MacBook Air resting beneath the display, but between the magsafe connector and the thunderbolt cable, the result is a mess of cables. That is where the BookArc for Air comes in. The BookArc is a vertical stand that not only holds your Air, but it also has a built-in cable manager. The BookArc holds your cables in place, so that not only does it keep your workspace clear of clutter, but it also keeps your cables from falling off your desk each time you unplug them from your MacBook Air.\nAnd unlike some other competing MacBook stands that we have seen on the market, with its aluminum finish, the BookArc for Air is also designed to match the MacBook Air to a T. The device blends in perfectly with your Air and Apple Thunderbolt Display. The BookArc is also designed with a soft, cushiony insert to hold your MacBook Air securely, along with silicone foot pads at the bottom of the BookArc, which are used to hold everything securely in place.\nAs if we weren\u2019t sold on the BookArc for Air, there is one last benefit to using it \u2013 and that is that it can actually help speed up your MacBook Air! TwelveSouth says that the BookArc manages this by keeping your MacBook Air display closed, so that your Mac has more pep in its step, as opposed to when it has to power two displays at once.\nThe BookArc for Air retails for $39.99. A BookArc is also available for the MacBook Pro.\nAll in all, TwelveSouth has done a great job of creating two clever products that help clean up your desk, while still matching that beautiful Apple aesthetic. Both the BookArc for Air and the BackPack 2 are high quality, well thought out products that are pretty much must-haves for an Apple display owner."}

His defense team says he was acting as a private citizen when he promoted the business.\nBut the government insists he used his Congressional seat to profit, took bribes and bribed a foreign official to try and land iGate a lucrative contract.\nAfter the tapes played, Vernon Jackson, the president of iGate, sat in a faded forest green prison suit on the witness stand interpreting or clarifying the conversations. Jackson pleaded guilty to bribing Jefferson and got a 7 year and 3 month prison sentence.\nRepeatedly, Jackson said the Congressman was calling a lot of the business shots for iGate and acting in his official capacity as a Congressman when promoting his business.

Apparently, some eight-legged Porsche fans are already in love.\nWho couldn\u2019t use some Hawaiian sun, and a 375-horsepower Porsche convertible right about now?\nDepending on where you are when reading this review, that comment could seriously hit home \u2013 or it might veer wide of the mark, if you happen to be sipping a pina colada pool-side, preferably someplace warm and tropical.\nIf you\u2019re anywhere near the Northeast, however, a little sports car magic (and some snow-free driving) is just what you need. So allow my editorial procrastination to provide the cure for those wintry blues, my car loving and snow-covered friends.\nLighter and much more powerful than the standard Boxster, the Spyder uses the engine from the last-gen 911 Carrera S.\nTruth be told, I drove the new 2016 Porsche Boxster Spyder a couple months ago, on the winding roads of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. It was my first time visiting our fiftieth state and, as you can imagine, many a pina colada was enjoyed \u2013 well, they were actually mai tais (I think\u2026some evenings got blurry).\nWhatever the case, time got away from me. Holidays happened. Auto shows happened. Grocery shopping, dog walking, and more mai tais all happened, too. It\u2019s a pretty good gig when you can forget to write about a Porsche drive\u2026in Hawaii!\nHate me now, if you will. Or admire these pictures and imagine the sound of ocean surf, along with the purr of a Porsche flat-6 engine.\nPorsche has also retuned the suspension and trimmed 66 lbs. of weight to create the Spyder.\nI\u2019ve always been a big fan of the Boxster, even if the original didn\u2019t quite live up to the drama and glamor of the stunning Boxster concept car that appeared way back in 1993. If you\u2019ve never seen it, do so now, all via the wonders of this thing called the internet.\nThe Boxster's mid-engine layout puts the motor right where it should be, not behind the rear axle like the seminal 911 sports car. For that reason, conspiracies abound that Porsche deliberately holds back on the horsepower for the Boxster, along with its mechanically identical cousin, the Cayman hardtop coupe. The German automaker can\u2019t have its cheaper sports cars outdo the mighty 911, after all.\nFor my money, any Boxster is a blast, even if it doesn\u2019t necessarily have massive amounts of thrust in base format. Combine superb handling and excellent weight balance, add in a suspension that informs you exactly what\u2019s going on at each wheel \u2013 but doesn\u2019t beat you over the head with jittery feedback \u2013 and the result is one of the world\u2019s most usable sports machines. Even the front and rear trunks are hugely practical. Yes, this sports car has two trunks (and they're fantastically useful).\nI know, Porsche makes oodles of money selling Cayenne and Macan SUVs (shudder!).

If the administration were to rectify its error in the case of Abdulmutallab, it would raise the question why it refuses to rectify the same or similar error in the case of KSM et al. in New York. Indeed, it would in a sense be conceding the error.\nI am afraid that there is an underlying source of the error in the erroneous principles that are guiding the Obama administration. As to acts of terorrorism committed in the United States, the Obama administration seems to have established a presumption that criminal treatment is appropriate.\nReferring to the Abdulmutallab case over the weekend, the Washington Post wrote of the administration\u2019s \u201cknee-jerk default to a crime-and-punishment model.\u201d But the crime-and-punishment model is not knee-jerk. It is the end result of a deliberative process under which Atttorney General Holder promulgated his inscrutable protocol.\nUnder the protocol, KSM was assigned for trial in federal court rather than before a military commission in Guantanamo. The trial of Abdulmutallab in federal court as a criminal rather than in a military commission as an enemy combatant appears to comport with the protocol. If the protocol is wrong in principle, decisions that comport with it will frequently err as well. Michael Isikoff provides some evidence of the Obama administration operating in a deliberative process under an erroneous principle in Abdulmutallab\u2019s case.\nThe question remains: where does Obama stand on the case of Abdulmutallab? Does the buck stop with him, with Eric Holder or with the local FBI agents on the ground in New York. Stephen Hayes elaborates on the manifold absurdities at play in the administration\u2019s pronouncements on theAbdulmutallab case. As Hayes rightly notes, these pronouncements call into question the administration\u2019s understanding that we are engaged in a war."}

The real trick to becoming a successful IT leader is to master the \u2018art\u2019 of the job.\nAs a seven-time CIO I\u2019ve had an opportunity to observe the good, the bad and the ugly aspects of IT management up close and personal. My recently published book, Truth From the Trenches: A Practical Guide to the Art of IT Management, is my attempt to share my experiences with emerging IT leaders to help them avoid the chronic problems that afflict so many IT organizations. This is the first in a series of articles highlighting key takeaways from my book.\nIT management is an acquired skill that can\u2019t be learned through academic studies or formal certification programs. Effective IT management is a craft that is mastered over time through personal job experience. You could say it closely resembles the training that medieval artisans received as they progressed through the apprentice, journeyman and master craftsman stages of their careers. Even widely accepted management frameworks for IT operations (e.g. ITIL or COBIT) or software development (e.g. Carnegie Mellon CMMI, agile or DevOps) or project management (e.g. PMBOK) are nothing more than a collection of structured guidelines. If an IT organization chooses to leverage any of these frameworks they must be customized to suit the organization\u2019s business needs and technical sophistication. IT management frameworks should never be treated as prescriptive \"cookbooks.\" Rather they should be treated as books about cooking that leave considerable discretion to the kitchen staff in devising individual recipes.\nTo further complicate matters, successful IT management is defined through the eyes of the employees and colleagues who are the recipients of IT services. In other fields, such as finance and HR, success can be defined quite explicitly with respect to accounting standards and regulatory compliance. IT success is measured much more subjectively, largely by the satisfaction of its clients.\nFor all of the reasons outlined above, IT management is truly two parts art and one part science. All IT organizations are called upon to implement new applications, update existing systems, obtain business approval for new investments, safeguard company information, respond to end user issues and requests, etc. But the ways they go about managing these activities can vary considerably depending upon the size of the IT organization, its technical sophistication, the complexity of the business it supports, a company\u2019s culture and the prior experience of its executives. IT leaders generally have equal access to operational best practices, regardless of the frameworks they choose to adopt. Consequently, it\u2019s relatively easy to get the \"science\" of the job right. The real trick to becoming a successful IT leader is to master the \"art\" of the job.\nProfessions that rely on experiential learning to grow and prosper need to pass the lessons learned by one generation of practitioners down to the next. Unfortunately, the IT profession historically does an abysmal job of schooling successive generations of IT leaders. Although research firms and industry consultants have plenty of advice for rising IT leaders, there\u2019s no oral or written tradition of practical storytelling that captures the true trials and tribulations of effective IT executives. Consequently, many current day practitioners are caught in a vicious cycle resembling the plot of my favorite Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day \u2014 endlessly repeating the same meaningless activities, committing the same mistakes and solving the same problems as their predecessors.\nPersonal experience has taught me that the failings of most IT organizations can generally be traced to three root causes: talent debt, performance mismanagement and the failure to develop effective working relationships with their customers.\nTalent debt is pervas"}

Madrid's economy minister said a formal request would be made in days for the bailout, which was agreed two weeks ago.\nMany in the markets see the package as a mere prelude to a full program for the Spanish state, which Madrid vehemently denies it will need.\nSpain's financial plight took centre stage a week before a European Union summit tackles long-term plans for closer fiscal and banking union in a bid to strengthen the euro's foundations, after bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal failed to end a 2-1/2-year old debt crisis.\nTo pave the way, the leaders of Germany, Italy, France and Spain will meet in Rome on Friday.\n\"We are clearly seeing additional tension and acute stress applying to both banks and sovereigns in the euro area,\" International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, who attended the Luxembourg meeting, told reporters.\n\"With that in mind, the IMF believes that a determined and forceful move towards complete European monetary union should be reaffirmed.\"\nTwo independent audits by consultants Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman found that Spanish banks would need between 51 and 62 billion euros in extra capital to weather a serious downturn in the economy and new losses on their books.\nThe Bank of Spain said the 100 billion euros offered to Madrid two weeks ago would give a wide margin of error. Spain's three biggest banks would not need extra capital even in a stressed scenario, it said. The government said it did not expect to shut any banks and would restructure those in trouble.\nIn Luxembourg, the finance ministers decided Spain should initially apply to the euro zone's temporary rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, with the loan taken over by the permanent bailout fund the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) once it is up and running after July 9.\n\"The financial assistance will be provided by the EFSF until the ESM becomes available, and then it will be transferred to the ESM,\" Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers, told a news conference.\n\"We would expect the Spanish authorities to put forward a formal request for financial assistance by next Monday,\" he said.\nSuch a solution should avert a problem which had scared investors: debt issued by the ESM must be paid back first in case of a Spanish default, relegating private creditors lower in the pecking order.

{"idx": "33492", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Many dividend investors love midstream MLPs because their tollbooth-like business models make forincredibly generous and secure high yields. However, the recent oil crash has proved that some payouts are much safer than others. Take, for example,ONEOK Partners and its 10.4% yielding distribution.\nObviously, Wall Street has its doubts about the safety of that payout, and since its general partner ONEOK derives almost all of its income from its MLP, the same holds true to a slightly lesser extent for its 8.5% dividend. Let&apos;s look at ONEOK&apos;s latest earnings results to see just how badly the oil crash is hurting ONEOK, and, more importantly, how safe these payouts might prove in the year ahead.\nData sources: ONEOK Partners 10-Q, earnings release.\nONEOK Partners ismore exposed to falling commodity prices than many of its midstream MLP competitors. Thus this quarter&apos;s results were dinged by falling NGL, natural gas, and condensate prices which were offset by increased volumes, and improved margins.\nThe margin gains came from two sources. First the proportion of ONEOK&apos;s margin generated by fee based contracts increased as management works to make the MLP&apos;s cash flows more predictable over time. In addition, NGL transportation margin benefited from increased Permian basin volumes due to the 2014 acquisition of the West Texas LPG pipeline system.\nHowever, the most important thing for income investors to focus on is DCF since that is what secures and allows for growth in the distribution. On that front ONEOK Partners didn&apos;t do so hot.\nSources: ONEOK earnings release, Fastgraph.\nIn order to assure their payouts are sustainable in the long-term both ONEOK Partners and ONEOK should maintain their DCRs above 1. ONEOK&apos;s coverage ratio meets that criterion because its combination of general partner interest, incentive distribution rights, and 41.2% ownership of ONEOK Partners means that around 70% of the MLP&apos;s marginal adjusted EBITDA flows back to the general partner in the form of distributions and fees.\nOn the other hand ONEOK Partners&apos; DCR has fallen substantially over the past year and is now in danger of a possible distribution cut if management can&apos;t raise it in the coming quarters. The reason for the DCR&apos;s decline (despite a small year over year increase in DCF) was largely due to a 20% increase in unit count that resulted from just over $1 billion in equity sales over the past year. Those proceeds were used to fund growth capital expenditures, pay down debt, and help acquire some pipeline assets from Chevron for $800 million.\nSince ONEOK derives almost all of its income from its MLP, the long-term sustainability of its own dividend is directly dependent on whether ONEOK Partners&apos; DCR can be raised to 1 or more in 2016. Luckily for investors, management believes that it&apos;s on track to do just that.\nONEOK&apos;s 2016 plan to secure the payoutONEOK&apos;s plans to preserve its distribution revolves via two strategies. First, over the next year ONEOK Partners will put into service eight growth projects worth about $1.435 billion.$210 million of those projects consist of new natural gas pipelines which is important because they represent ONEOK&apos;s most cash flow source.

But apparently, Democrats John Kerry and John Edwards think it's funny to compare Hispanic Republicans to roaches -- or so it seems based on their behavior at a recent fundraiser in New York City.\nKerry and Edwards were both yucking it up at Radio City Music Hall last week when a star-studded line up of comedians and rock stars entertained the crowd with off-color jokes and Bush-bashing, raising $7.5 million in the process. Neither Kerry nor Edwards said a word when Whoopi Goldberg made nasty sexual allusions to both the president's and vice-president's names. In fact, the New York Post's Deborah Orin reports that Kerry \"could be seen laughing uproariously\" during the Goldberg riff, full of vulgar language and even worse taste.\nYou would think they'd be a little more wary of associating themselves with ethnically offensive remarks, however. So when comedian John Leguizamo said he refuses to believe there are any Hispanic Republicans --\"Latins for Republicans, it's like roaches for Raid\"-- you might have hoped Kerry and Edwards would feel compelled to say something to distance themselves. During the primaries, Howard Dean ran into similar difficulties at another star-studded New York fundraiser where entertainers made heavy use of the \"N\" word, but Dean had the good sense to come on stage and say he didn't like the tone of some of the odious humor.\nThe dynamic duo of Kerry and Edwards stayed mum on the dirty jokes this time around. Kerry even opined that \"every performer tonight ... conveyed to you the heart and soul of our country,\" while Edwards noted that \"this campaign will be a celebration of real American values.\" Some values.\nCan you imagine the outcry if Republicans hosted an event in which performers compared Latinos to cockroaches based on their voting behavior? It is almost inconceivable that the media would not be all over the story, with round-the-clock coverage, demands that heads roll, and ultimately, the candidate taking the blame. The double standard is appalling. When Democrats use four-letter words, make raunchy references to their opponents, even when they insult minority groups, the media give them a pass.\nIronically, the Kerry campaign announced this week that it will be spending $1 million in Spanish language advertising over the next two weeks to appeal to Hispanic voters.

It will also focus on whether storm victims will be obligated to pay their own legal bills, which could account for a third of their settlements.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the National Flood Insurance Program, initiated the settlement talks in February after months of fighting storm victims in court. The about-face came after homeowners presented evidence suggesting companies hired by FEMA had forged documents to underpay claims.\nThose allegations have led to a criminal investigation by the New York State attorney general. Last week, a congressional aide confirmed that the U.S. Senate Banking Committee was launching an inquiry of its own.\nThe settlement talks on flood claims, meanwhile, have led to tentative agreements to resolve about 650 lawsuits in New York and New Jersey. But the deals are not final. And it's unclear if Monday's hearing will rekindle the talks, which stalled two weeks ago.\nNew York Rising was launched to help distribute the $50.5 billion Sandy relief package signed by President Barack Obama in 2013. The funding, from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, included grants of as much as $400,000 for homeowners to rebuild and protect homes from future storms.\nThose grants are subject to a federal law called the Stafford Act. It prohibits disaster victims from receiving government assistance for expenses already covered by insurance, loans or other sources.\nSo if a homeowner receives a $1,000 grant to fix a roof -- but later receives an insurance settlement to pay for the job -- the grant must be returned. Every storm victim who received a New York Rising grant signed an agreement to abide by that rule.\nNow the prospect of receiving larger flood insurance settlements makes the ramifications of that agreement painfully clear.\nTo be sure, some homeowners across Long Island who received New York Rising grants have built bigger homes than those they owned before Sandy. In many instances, they built taller to comply with floodplain building codes. In some, they added bedrooms or bathrooms, sometimes by augmenting disaster grants and insurance proceeds with their own money.\nYet lawyers for homeowners say few, if any, storm victims profited from flood insurance or New York Rising"}

It doesn\u2019t seem right at all. When their season ends, yes, of course. But not while still in pursuit of a championship.\nEven with your employers permission, it feels sneaky. Dirty, almost.\nMatt Nagy was in a similar position last year, when he was the offensive coordinator in Kansas City. The Bears had fired John Fox and wanted to talk to him about their head coaching job. But Nagy handled it the right way.

Nonetheless, Nagy says Fangio is continuously \u201cgrinding\u201d through his duties, always watching video with remote in hand, always taking notes, always coming up with ways to make the Bears defence better.\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s so important to focus,\u201d said Nagy. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to your peers, it\u2019s not fair to your players.

When you take a step back and you think about the situation we\u2019re in, for him to get an opportunity and for his name to be thrown out here as a possible head coaching candidate, how can you not be happy for somebody, as the person and the coach.

{"idx": "33507", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: It may be natural to pine for the \"good old days,\" but that feeling is misplaced when it comes to retirement. Despite the challenges that older people face today, retirement today is much better than it was in 1950.\nAccording to a report from the Stanford Center on Longevity (SCL), in 1950 a 65-year-old man could expect to live to age 78, or an additional 13 years. By 2010, a man age 65 could expect to live to age 82, or 17 years longer. A woman age 65 in 1950 could expect to live another 15 years, to age 80, but by 2010 her life expectancy was 84.\nThe introduction of early retirement and disability benefits allowed more people to retire early. In 1950, you had to wait until age 65 to collect Social Security retirement benefits. Early retirement, at age 62, was introduced in 1956 for women and in 1961 for men. Social Security's disability benefits were also introduced in 1956.\nThe average monthly Social Security benefit increased from $29 in 1950 to $1,262 in 2012. Adjusted for inflation, that $29 translates to $280 in 2012 dollars, which means that the average Social Security benefit two years ago was worth 4.5 times the average benefit in 1950.\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, the median income for married couples age 65 and older increased from $20,750 in 1962 to an inflation-adjusted $44,718 by 2010. Similarly, over that same period of time the median income for a single person age 65 and older increased from $8,159 to $17,261. The median incomes for retirees in 1950 were even smaller than the incomes in 1962. Meanwhile, retirees today are three times as likely to receive a private pension as retirees in 1962.\nThese increases in income have all contributed to a significant decline in poverty among the aged, as shown in the first SCL report mentioned above. In 1959, for instance, roughly a third of people age 65 and older lived in poverty; by 2008, this percentage had declined to 10 percent.\nAnother important difference between then and now is that in 1950, retirement hadn't yet been glamorized by the media as the \"golden years,\" an extended period of travel and recreation. Most retirees didn't retire to pursue their hobbies and interests -- rather they stopped working because they were unable to continue. After retirement, they lived simply and modestly in the communities where they had worked and lived all their lives.\nIn 1950, most people had one car at most. There were no computers, wide-screen TVs or cellphones. Long-distance phone calls were expensive, and most people kept in touch with far-away relatives via handwritten letters. Air travel was in its infancy, and it, too, was pricey. Hardly anybody ate at a restaurant, took a cruise or played golf. If you wanted to enjoy music, you listened to the radio, or if you were lucky you found a live performance. There were no music downloads, no CDs, no online radio.\nYou also had to pay for your medical bills out of"}

But these days, when Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona sells for more than $17 million and some nearly new watches are being resold for $10,000 to $20,000 more than retail, watch lovers might be forgiven for dreaming a bit more about investment value. Film producer and collector Marc Berliner calls some of the run-ups in prices \"insane.\" He points to Patek Philippe's steel Nautilus 5711/1A. While it retails for roughly $25,000, a pre-owned one \"sold at Christie's for $47,500.\"\nTimepieces like the Nautilus \u2014 which are extremely hard to get (Patek requires that buyers apply to purchase its watches) \u2014 are exceptions. Most watches begin depreciating the second they exit the store. \"In a best-case scenario, some watches become collectible and begin regaining value,\" says James Lamdin, founder of online vintage watch boutique Analog/Shift.\nToday, three Swiss luxury watch brands rule the secondary market: Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Patek Philippe, all of which tightly control supply of their most desired models. Rolex's steel Daytonas with ceramic bezels \u2014 which debuted in 2016 and are almost impossible to acquire unless you are a favored customer (\"Forget about it, you can't get one,\" says Lamdin) \u2014 now trade secondhand at $10,000 above the retail list price of $12,400.\nBut don't think just any Rolex will rise in price. \"It's a total myth that Rolexes don't depreciate,\" says Lamdin. What's critical is that it be a special model that isn't over-produced. Among the standouts seen at the 2018 watch fairs in Geneva and Basel this year are Rolex's new GMT- Master II in a red and blue colorway known as \"Pepsi\" (Ellen DeGeneres owns a vintage example), priced at around $9,300 in steel. \"I could see that selling for $20,000 to $25,000 easily in the next two to three years,\" says Hamilton Powell, founder of certified luxury watch marketplace Crown and Caliber. Lamdin thinks the pricey new Patek Philippe Perpetual Calendar Chronograph with a salmon dial (around $174,000) is a sure bet, while Tim Mosso, media director of pre-owned seller WatchBox, sees a rosy future for Audemars' $34,800 Royal Oak Extra Thin (Ref. 15202IP), which is limited to 250 pieces and has a blue dial in a titanium and platinum case. \"Clear winners have emerged in the form of new watches most likely to spawn dealer waitlists, strong secondary market demand, and potential \"long-term value retention,\" says Mosso.\nOther hot 2018 models recommended by dealers include Omega's limited-edition Seamaster Diver in titanium and tantalum ($"}

For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said.\nA week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes.\n\"One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate,\" Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. \"The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions.\"\nAsked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said \"I would,\" and compared that to previous presidents.\n\"Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire,\" Obama said. \"And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward.\"\nThe image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries.\nWhen news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support.\n\"A huge foreign policy win for President Trump,\" Hannity said March 8. \"Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the president\u2019s tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue.\"\nSo the text in the image matches what Hannity said.\nBut his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies.\nObama\u2019s policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas.\nPreconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea.\n\"During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions,\" DeThomas said.\nFor Trump, the picture is murkier.\nWhen Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had \"talked\" about it.\n\"Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze,\" Trump wrote. \"Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.\"\nBut for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for"}

Be sure to rotate the toys to keep your cat's interest.\nNext, be sure to provide items that your cat can explore. It doesn't have to be something expensive. An empty cardboard box or even a paper sack would work. Cat condos can be made or bought at pet stores and have various levels where a cat can climb, hide or just sprawl out.\nAn aquarium with real fish or even fake ones can also provide hours of entertainment for a cat. If you choose to have live fish, make sure that your cat is not able to access the fish themselves. Some cats also enjoy the commercial video tapes made especially for cats. These are hours of entertaining cat television such as close ups of birds and fish.\nIf you have a backyard haven for birds, allow your cat to have a perch in the nearest window so that he can watch the birds feed and fly around your yard. One of our shelter cats, Moxie, loves to watch out the windows at the birds and spends quite a bit of time chortling at them.\nPlacing a feeder for squirrels, birds or hummingbirds in view of a window provides easy and cheap entertainment for your cat.

But along the way, they might find some business partners adamant about using another technology for the same purpose, electronic business with XML.\nUnder development since the late 1990s, ebXML is a multifunction e-business framework that includes a secure document-messaging component and a methodology for constructing those documents. Web services, of course, fits a similar description, although the degree to which they help businesses conduct more than the simplest of online transactions is one subject of the Web services vs. ebXML debate. Another topic is whether a debate is needed at all. A number of experts say the two technologies are complementary, because ebXML can, and does, employ Web services underpinnings such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).\n\u201cPeople are seeing they can use these things in combination,\u201d says David Webber, an independent consultant who chairs the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards\u2019 (OASIS) Content Assembly for ebXML technical committee and co-authored the book, \u201cebXML: The New Global Standard for Doing Business.\u201d He argues that Web services are king for informational sorts of transactions, such as checking stock with a business partner. But the purchasing act requires systems that can communicate on a more meaningful level, with proper security. All of which ebXML provides, he says.\n\u201cPeople think of ebXML as a holistic framework rather than having multiple aspects that can be adopted independently,\u201d says Joseph Chiusano, senior consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. in McLean, Va., and a member of the OASIS ebXML technical committee. While Web services didn\u2019t really exist when ebXML was conceived, OASIS and UN/CEFACT, an international standards body that also plays a role in ebXML development, have since made multiple efforts to incorporate Web services components in ebXML. Those include an interface that enables ebXML messages to be carried via SOAP, and the ability to register and discover Web Services Description Language (WSDL) documents.\nBut John Radko, chief architect of global technology operations at e-business service provider Global eXchange Services Inc., sees the power struggle as quite real. \u201cThe conflict is simply this: If you use one, you\u2019re not using the other.\u201d While it\u2019s true that the same company might employ ebXML and Web services for different applications, the two don\u2019t interoperate. If you want to send a trading partner a message using ebXML, the partner has to support ebXML, he says. The same is true for Web services.\nRadko says he sits in on numerous meetings in which the ebXML vs. Web services debate rages on. Members of the auto industry, for example, are debating whether to use ebXML document formats or those that are more closely aligned with Web services, such as WS-Attachments. This Microsoft-developed specification is at least the third attempt at defining how to send files back and forth in a Web services environment.\nHe says such a specification must have four basic attributes: to, from, message type and a message ID, for tracking. \u201cEbXML does all that great; it was designed from the ground up to do that,\u201d Radko says. Work is underway in standards bodies including the Internet Engineering Task Force and World Wide Web Consortium to define the same attributes for Web services.\nLarge vendors, too, are picking sides in the debate. \u201cSun is a big backer of ebXML, so that tells you who is not,\u201d Chiusano says.\nRadko also notes that Web services suite vendors, including IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., don\u2019t have"}

Today, as a mom, I encourage my kids to maintain healthy and balanced diets, but I'll always have a soft spot for treats like corn dogs and deep-fried Twinkies when we visit the fair.\nParents in Iowa and across the country know how challenging it can be to keep excited, energetic children and teenagers engaged and active when school is out. I know that parents never stop thinking about how to maintain their family's health and integrate balance into their kids' lives. When our families are healthy, our communities are healthy. As head of the American Beverage Association (ABA), I've seen the impact we can have when teachers, community leaders, parents, and CEOs like myself come together to achieve this goal.\nAmerica\u2019s beverage companies have heard from consumers \u2014 especially moms \u2014 that they are looking for ways to cut sugar from their families\u2019 diets. We\u2019re stepping up to help them do this by reformulating beverages to contain less sugar, creating more low-calorie and zero-sugar options than ever before, and inventing the mini-can.\nWe\u2019re not only introducing these new options, but we\u2019re also making sure they are accessible and encouraging consumers to try them. New in-store marketing techniques are being implemented in beverage aisles, and companies are working with retailers to change shelf layouts to attract consumer attention toward reduced-calorie options and smaller package sizes. We are proud to report that, due in part to our efforts, 48 percent of all non-alcoholic beverages purchased today have no sugar, and 60 percent of new brands and flavors hitting the market are low- or zero-calorie drinks.\nThese actions are just the latest steps we\u2019ve taken to support parents trying to find the right balance for their kids. In 2010, we partnered with the with the Alliance For A Healthier Generation (Healthier Generation) to implement the National School Beverage Guidelines, a voluntary initiative to remove full-calorie beverages from schools. This gave parents more control to balance what their children drink, and as a result, there was a 90 percent reduction in calories shipped to schools.\nOur latest and boldest endeavor, Balance Calories Initiative, is a commitment in partnership with Healthier Generation to reduce calories consumed per person nationally by 20 percent by 2025. In 2015, the Iowa Beverage Association announced its commitment to Balance Calories Iowa as a way to support the efforts of then-Gov. Terry Branstad and then-Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (now the governor) to make Iowa the healthiest state in the nation. In communities across the country, Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo are putting competition aside and working together with community organizations, public health professionals, and families themselves to change the environment in which families buy and consume beverage products.\nWith thousands of employees in communities across America, we want our hometowns and our neighbors to be vibrant and healthy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll never stop listening to our consumers and working to provide expanded access to information and choices on the grocery shelf. We all win when families are empowered to make the best choices for their homes.\nSusan Neely is an Iowa native and currently serves as president and CEO of the American Beverage Association."}

I'd eaten a devon and sauce sandwich for lunch, and it must have been a tad ripe, because the nausea came on strong and sudden in the middle of my music lesson, causing me to sprint for the bathroom, splurking all the way, finishing the hurl off in the bathroom sink. With five kids, Mrs O'Brien was a spew veteran and she barely flinched at the pale pink carnage I'd left soaking into her olive carpet. She simply wiped my face and sent me home.\nWhen I told mum what happened her first hopeful question was had I managed to sick in the toilet, although deep down she probably already knew the horrible truth. Because when it came to errant chundering, I had form.\nI've always been burdened with a weak stomach. I've troubled the sawdust guy at both Melbourne and Sydney Luna Parks. I lost countless Sunday dinners to those roundabouts in the playground, and a Dux family drive wouldn't have been complete without Monica executing at least one curbside chunder. I vomited so much during my pregnancies that the first chapter of my recent book is simply titled ''Puke''. Even today, I am the canary in the food-poisoning coalmine. If a meal is even slightly suspect, I'm sure to be the one who alerts my fellow diners to the fact, as I shout for Huey on the great white telephone.\nDespite the megalitres of stomach contents that she cleaned up during my childhood, my mum never complained. The only thing that she ever asked of me was could I please aim for the toilet bowl, not the sink. Flushing was easy. Pushing chunks down the plughole, not so much. But even this modest request came to nothing. Children can be such selfish creatures, and when you've got an upset stomach the last thing you want to do is squat over a toilet bowl, getting up close and personal with the place where your brothers do their business.\nThe sink, by contrast, was a nice clean place, and I didn't even have to bend over. Easier still was to just do it where I stood, which is exactly what I usually did. Having delivered up my last meal I'd just stand there, head thrust back in a melodramatic wail, waiting for the coos of sympathy to rain down upon me.\nIt might sound gross, but I believe that being sick to your stomach can trigger some genuinely revelatory moments in life. After you move out of home, there's nothing like spending a night alone vomiting to make you realise that you really are a grown-up now, out on your own. And the friend who hangs around to hold your hair back as you regurgitate in the gutter after a few too many lagers, you know that they're a friend to keep.\nLast week I had such a revelation when my son's grade 1 teacher called to let me know that he'd followed in his mother's footsteps by being sick in class. As I raced down to the school to pick him up my first concern was not for his physical, but his emotional wellbeing. I assumed that vomiting so publicly would be a humiliating experience for a little boy, and when I arrived on the scene and discovered that he'd managed to spray a significant part of his classroom, my fears grew. Yet as his teacher handed me a plastic bag containing his sick-covered hoodie, my son seemed completely relaxed with it all. Almost pleased with himself.\nAs we walked home this"}

There is a particular focus on girls in this respect, to address the gender imbalance in the industry, where just 17 percent of IT professionals are female.\nChanges are also needed to the IT-related school curriculum, to make it more exciting and relevant for students, to encourage them to pursue IT in academia and industry. The manifesto recommends that industry gets involved in this, and in providing access to industry expertise and resources for IT teaching.\nIt also encourages industry to get more involved in higher education, by extending the delivery of work-based programmes, and co-investing with government in higher level technology skills through the National Skills Academy for IT.\nAnother suggestion made by the manifesto is the creation of a system to nationally and internationally recognize organisations and individuals that use technology to innovate and increase productivity in the UK.\nIn addition to this, it recommends the provision of incentives for small companies to invest in IT for their business, and also providing practical help for smaller companies.\n\"Partnership between employers and government is the key to making sure the UK has the technology skills it needs.\n\"We also need to make employer-backed IT degrees central to the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths] agenda, and help more smaller companies to exploit and innovate through IT.\"\nMeanwhile, the manifesto said that 92 percent of new recruits in any industry are required to have skills in the use of IT.\nIt therefore wants to address the problem of people potentially becoming socially excluded if they do not have these basic skills by supporting development of e-skills amongst groups including older workers and lower skilled individuals."}

After graduating from Dobyns-Bennett High School, he attended Tennessee Wesleyan College and then the University of Tennessee, where he received a B.S. in science education. He served from 1954 to 1956 with the counter intelligence corps of the U.S. Army, receiving a special award for his accomplishments upon completion of the CIC course at Fort Holabird, Baltimore. He then re-entered UT, received a B.A. in botany/geology, moved on to graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis, where he studied paleobotany, received a Ph.D. in 1961, and then came to the University of Illinois, where he spent his long and distinguished career.\nIn April 1967, Tom married Mary Patricia \"Pat\" Paden, whom he met at biological sciences meetings. They had two sons, Thomas Rutherford and Andrew Robb Phillips.\nHe was predeceased by his son, Thomas; brother, Haynes Phillips; sister, Sue Carroll; and parents.\nHe is survived by Pat, his wife of 51 years; son, Drew (Cristina Berretta) of Portland, Ore.; daughter, Mary (Bill Schopp) of Rogers, Ark.; granddaughters, Taylor and Elizabeth; sister-in-law, Carolyn Phillips; and nine nieces and nephews.\nAs part of a three-man team of paleobotanists, he went on trips lasting two months to Ellesmere Island, the northernmost island in North America, in the summers of 1962 and 1963. There, he and his colleagues collected plant fossils of the Devonian period, indicators of a temperate climate 400 million years ago. His subsequent research focused on the Carboniferous period, the Coal Age, over 300 million years ago.\nMany collecting trips to coal mines, searching for \u201ccoal balls,\u201d limestone masses densely packed with anatomically preserved plant fossils, resulted in the largest coal ball collection in the world, some 40,000 specimens.

According to Elshamy, after he recounted his experience, the officer dismissed the woman\u2019s harsh comments as \"freedom of speech.\"\n\u201cSorry man, they curse us too,\" the officer replied, Elshamy said. \"It's number one in the American constitution. Anyone can say whatever they want, it's freedom of speech.\"\nIn his post, Elshamy went on to ponder the absurdity of this statement, taking the simple concept of human decency into question. \"So insulting people based on how they look, where they come from, language they speak, is still considered freedom of speech?\" he asked, before considering this could be the precise reason why America is facing so many social justice issues.\nElshamy told Mashable, \"when the officer told me we can\u2019t do anything unless she strikes or attacks you, it made no sense to me because hate speech is what leads to hate crime.\"\nThough he explained that people will occasionally cast anxious glances his way on the subway, Elshamy said this is the first time anyone in the city has ever taken action and abused him.\n\"They\u2019re just racist. I don\u2019t think this has to do with America as a nation,\" he said, explaining that when he shared his experience on Facebook a majority of the people who supported him were his American friends.\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, a depressingly large number of hateful acts against minorities have been reported and shared online.\nUltimately, Elshamy decided to share his experience to raise awareness. \"I felt, 'This is so annoying',\" he said. \"It's something that\u2019s actually happening in New York, which everyone tells me is the most open-minded place in the states.\"\n\"It\u2019s just sad,\" he concluded. \"It\u2019s sad that this is happening in 2016.\"\nThe NYPD told Mashable there was no incident recorded in regards to Elshamy's allegations. Starbucks has been contacted for comment.\nIf you are the victim of a hate crime, take action by reporting the incident to your local authorities and filing a report."}

Dimon has also begun meeting personally with regulators to improve relationships, he said.\n\"Unfortunately, we are all well aware of the news around the legal and regulatory issues facing our company, and in the coming weeks and months we need to be braced for more to come,\" Dimon said in the memo, which was obtained by Reuters.\nJPMorgan has added 4,000 staff to its control groups since 2012 - three quarters of them this year - and increased spending on those efforts by about $1 billion. The bank&apos;s control group includes risk, compliance, legal, finance, technology, oversight and control and audit functions.\nThe bank is also trying to simplify by getting rid of businesses that are not core to its business model, Dimon said. For instance, JPMorgan has stopped selling identity theft protection and credit insurance to customers, Dimon said. Earlier this month, the bank said it was getting out of the student loan business, and is also planning to exit physical commodities trading.\nThe bank is also conducting a review of its foreign correspondent banking business and paying closer attention to outside vendor partners, Dimon said.\nJPMorgan and Dimon himself have come under fire since last year, when a large, money-losing derivatives trade came to light, eventually costing the bank more than $6 billion in trading losses, and leading to the indictment on Monday of two former employees. The bank expects to pay at least $700 million to settle civil law investigations into the matter.\nJPMorgan is also facing probes by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies that are looking into subjects including energy trading, possible bribery in hiring practices in China, and possibly fraudulent sales of mortgage securities.\nDimon did not specify what new legal and regulatory issues he expects the bank to face, but emphasized that JPMorgan&apos;s control undertaking was a company-wide priority. After acknowledging mistakes, he said the bank and its employees are \"facing our issues and rolling up our sleeves to fix them.\"\nFollowing the \"Whale\" scandal, the 57-year-old CEO faced a bruising battle with some shareholders to retain his chairman title earlier this year, and has since been under pressure to improve the bank&apos;s relationship with regulators.\nIn the memo, Dimon said he now personally meets with bank examiners \"on a regular basis\" and held town hall meetings in May and June for examiners from top U.S. regulators and staff who regularly deal with those examiners.\nJPMorgan also has what Dimon described as a \"state-of-the-art control room\" at its corporate headquarters in Manhattan, from which staff devoted to control and operational risk matters can retrieve data from across the firm to spot problems. Dimon called the control initiative an \"unprecedented effort\" for JPMorgan Chase.\n\"Never before have we focused so much time, effort, brainpower, technological power and money on a single, enterprise-wide objective,\" Dimon said."}

The Pac-12, meanwhile, has no representation in the AP Top 25 Poll for the seventh consecutive week.\nHere are the five biggest winners and losers for Week 15 of the college basketball season.\nMike Krzyzewski and the Duke Blue Devils are sitting pretty this week. After romping the Boston College Eagles by 25 points at Cameron Indoor Stadium Tuesday night, No. 2 Duke traveled to Charlottesville to take on the then-No. 3 Virginia Cavaliers at John Paul Jones Arena. The Blue Devils racked up 81 points against the notoriously stalwart Virginia defense to deal the Cavaliers a 10-point loss and sweep them on the season.

Then, four days later, Florida State welcomed the No. 16 Louisville Cardinals to Tallahassee and dealt them a five-point overtime loss. The Seminoles have a light week coming up as they'll face ACC bottom dwellers Wake Forest and Georgia Tech Wednesday and Saturday, respectively.\nAfter losing to the Iowa Hawkeyes and falling two spots in the AP Top 25 Poll last week, the No. 6 Michigan Wolverines felt some pressure to right the ship this week. They did just that, routing the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on the road before exacting revenge against the then-No. 19 Wisconsin Badgers, who beat Michigan in Ann Arbor last month. The Wolverines will face a ranked opponent every week for the remainder of the season, and next they'll travel to State College to take on the Penn State Nittany Lions before hosting the No. 24 Maryland Terrapins.\nGonzaga hasn't made too many headlines recently, but while we weren't looking the Bulldogs amassed 14 consecutive wins and rose back up into the top three of the AP Top 25 Poll.

{"idx": "33542", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Physical therapists help patients restore movement through exercise.\n2 How Much Money Do Physiologists Make?\n3 Does an Exercise Science Major Apply to Physical Therapy?\nExercise physiology and physical therapy both use exercise and physical movement to improve the condition of patients suffering from diseases or injuries. While physical therapy focuses on restoring movement to the restricted parts of the body, exercise physiology seeks to relieve symptoms through the cellular effect of exercise on the body.\nExercise physiology is a branch of health care that studies the biological effect of exercise on the body's cells and organs. The practice of exercise physiology seeks to prevent chronic diseases or to provide health benefits to those suffering from disease. Exercise physiology treats diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity.\nPhysical therapy uses techniques and exercises to restore movement in patients suffering from injuries, disease or aging. A physical therapy treatment plan uses an assessment of the patient's functional abilities to develop exercises and treatments that will restore maximum movement. The goal of physical therapy is to improve the quality of life through improved functional abilities and fitness.\nGraduate degree programs are available in exercise physiology and physical therapy. Physical therapists must have a minimum of a doctorate in physical therapy, but exercise physiologists may enter the field with a bachelor's degree. A graduate program in exercise physiology includes courses in biochemistry, exercise science, sport nutrition, exercise programming for patients with chronic diseases, biomechanics and environmental physiology. Physical therapy programs include courses in anatomy, kinesiology of the extremities, musculoskeletal examination, exercise physiology, orthotics and prosthetics. Physical therapy programs include clinical rotations and some graduates complete an additional residency program after graduation. Certification is available for exercise physiologists from the American Society of Exercise Physiologists.\nPhysical therapists work with patients who have physical disabilities, limitations, injuries or illnesses to improve their ability to move. The therapist assesses the patient's current condition and develops a treatment plan that may include exercises, massage and stimulation. Physical therapists evaluate the patient\u2019s progress and make changes to the treatment plan when it is needed. The median annual salary for physical therapists was $79,860 in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS salary statistics show the home health-care services industry paid the highest mean annual wage to physical therapists at $90,440.\nExercise physiologists work in hospitals, physical therapy offices, fitness centers and clinics. Physiologists assess patients with a fitness test to determine their current physical condition. The fitness test tracks the patient's heart rate, oxygen levels and blood pressure while they are engaged in physical activity. The assessment also evaluates the patient's strength and flexibility. Exercise physiologists use the information from the patient evaluation to prescribe a treatment of physical activity to improve chronic health conditions. The median annual salary of exercise physiologists in 2012 was $44,770, according to the BLS. The highest paying industry for 2012, according to the BLS statistics, was the home health-care services industry, which paid a mean annual wage of $71,980.\nKelchner, Luanne. \"What Is the Difference Between Exercise Physiology and Physical Therapy?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/difference-between-exercise-physiology-physical-therapy-26687.html.

{"idx": "33544", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Don't let misguided blame for the financial crisis keep you from scoring a deal on your next mortgage.\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) get a bad rap. Some worry that they're super risky for the borrower. Others contend that ARMs ultimately end in disaster due to the prevalence of exotic adjustable-rate mortgages leading up to the financial crisis.\nOne of the most common types of adjustable rate mortgages, the 5/1 ARM, features a fixed rate for 5 years, after which the rate resets once per year up or down based on the level of interest rates. Although many people simply dismiss their utility, I can think of three reasons why an ARM may be better than a fixed-rate mortgage.\nThe obvious advantage of an adjustable-rate mortgage is that they carry lower interest rates during the fixed period of the loan. At the time of writing, the lowest rate advertised on a major mortgage site for a 5/1 ARM was about 3.2% compared to a rate of 3.9% for a 30-year fixed loan.\nWhile the difference amounts to a mere 0.70 percentage points, it can make a big difference in your payment. The 30-year fixed mortgage carries a monthly payment of $943 per month, while the ARM carries a payment of about $865.\nThe smart thing to do might be to take out a 5/1 ARM but make monthly payments as if it were a 30-year fixed mortgage. By the end of the 5-year fixed period, the borrower will have made a much larger dent in their balance than the borrower who uses a 30-year fixed mortgage.\nHere's the math based on a $200,000 mortgage at current mortgage rates.\nAfter five years of equally sized payments, the buyer who used the 5/1 ARM instead of a 30-year mortgage would be more than $7,200 closer to paying off the home in full.\nHaving more home equity is a powerful buffer should interest rates rise. If, at the end of five years, your rate rises by more than 1 percentage point (from 3.2% to 4.25%), your monthly payment will simply match that of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Of course, the $7,200 in additional home equity you built up is yours to keep.\nA fixed-rate mortgage can be psychologically intoxicating. If rates go up, we get to feel like geniuses. If rates go down, we refinance, and feel smart for negotiating a better deal.\nIn either case, we feel like we win. But really, the biggest winner is the mortgage broker.\nDo nothing and enjoy your locked-in rate.\nPay thousands of dollars to refinance every time rates drop.\nPay thousands of dollars to refinance with a fixed-rate mortgage.\nDo nothing and enjoy your lower interest rate on your mortgage.\nIt's no wonder so many brokers seem to default to the assumption that locking in your rate is a good idea. The fear of rising rates creates action. \"Lock in your rates before they rise\" is a better pitch than \"come back tomorrow, rates might be lower.\"\nAfter roughly 40 years of broadly declining interest rates, it's only natural to worry that rates might start creeping higher. And that just might happen. Predicting where interest rates will go from here is impossible, and I won't pretend to have a crystal ball. But what I do know is that at any point in time, 5-year loans have"}

The committee was instructed to investigate if there was a need to amend the Constitution to make this possible.\nThe joint committee hearings are expected to be held at Westonaria Civic Centre in the West Rand on Thursday, the Sedibeng Town Hall in Vereeniging on Friday and at the Lucas van den Berg Community Hall in Pretoria West on Saturday.\nThe last venue in Tshwane raised the ire of residents. Some contacted News24 to complain that they would not get a chance to make submissions because the venue was too small.\n\"This is history in the making. People have to go and participate at these hearings. You cannot deny the people a right to do so, [allowing] only 100 or 300 inside.

Thekiso added that residents would also help the joint committee to market the sitting.\nHowever, committee co-chair Vincent Smith said the issue of a small venue was not unique to Tshwane.\n\"In all our venues, we have been oversubscribed and we have been saying this all along. We booked for around 300 people and it's just too late now to go and look for a venue that's bigger,\" said Smith, who pointed out that changing venues at such a late stage would lead to complaints about a last-minute change.\nSmith added that, if there was a need for an overflow area to be created at the hearings, it would be.

There, Kaufman captured CAIR-Florida representative Jawhar Badran committing the cardinal sin \u2014 expressing his group's carefully guarded views on Hamas.\nSpeaking into a microphone bearing CAIR's name and logo and standing beside a smiling Altaf Ali, the executive director of CAIR-Florida, [Badran] clearly and emphatically stated on video: \"Hamas is not a terrorist organization.\"\nAdditionally, when asked if Hamas was a terror group, one of the girls running video for CAIR said \"No,\" and a number of witnesses claim that Ali did the same.\nTheir timing could not have been worse. On March 6 a Palestinian terrorist massacred eight young students at a west Jerusalem religious seminary. Hamas has been widely fingered in the attack. A statement from the group later said, \"We bless the operation. It will not be the last.\"\nCAIR's credibility took another hit on March 26 when the former head of its Michigan branch, Muthanna Al-Hanooti, was charged with spying for Saddam Hussein.\nAccording to the indictment, Al-Hanooti would travel to Iraq and meet with conspirators of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. The indictment says that Al-Hanooti was rewarded with 2 million barrels of oil for his work.\nAl-Hanooti joins a growing list of CAIR officials jailed for participation in terrorist activities or working with states that sponsor them.\nOne can read all about this rogues' gallery in the Investigative Project on Terrorism's massive \"review of the history, activities, statements, and causes of and by CAIR.\" Published little by little beginning earlier this week, the report will serve as a one-stop reference for the many skeletons in CAIR's closet.\nThe good news for the Council on American-Islamic Relations is that March is nearly over. The bad news is that the rolling release of IPT's ten-part tome will extend into next month, ensuring that April starts badly as well.\nApril 16, 2008 update: CAIR had a lousy March, but chose to finish the month on a combative note. The organization issued a press release on March 31 declaring that representatives from it and other questionable Muslim lobby groups had visited Sami Al-Arian, the former professor who is serving time for his collaboration with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terrorist entity that has murdered Americans. He has been on a hunger strike after refusing to testify before a grand jury looking into Islamic charities. CAIR's very public support for Al-Arian will only add fuel to its critics' fire."}

In 2008, that number was 62,535. Next year, it is expected to hit 160,000.\nWhat changed the game for telehealth in the state\u2019s prison system? Electronic health records.\nWhen EHRs came into use 12 years ago, care providers at the on-site prison clinic and care givers at the prison hospital in Galveston could instantly look at the same material. TDCJ uses its own EHR system and can edit the source code to tweak it to its specifications, Murray said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve employed our own programmers to kind of \u2018correctionalize\u2019 our EHRs to put in what we need, both for direct patient care at the facilities, but also through telemedicine, so we\u2019ve been able to create our own forms, our own scheduling system -- everything that we need to be able to do our work as it relates our offender patients,\u201d he said.\nThe challenge now is maintaining enough bandwidth to keep up with all the video and data transmissions. To address that, Murray works with TDCJ and telecommunications providers to create and improve infrastructure. Additionally, all video and data transmissions are made via a secure, private network, he added.\nThe technology the telehealth program uses is kind of a \u201csmorgasbord,\u201d Murray said, because of the department\u2019s need to contain costs and meet budgets. Outpatient psychiatry, all of which is done via the telemedicine program, requires only that the psychiatrist and prison clinic have monitors to connect for sessions. Primary-care interactions involve more technology because providers must be able to look in ears and mouths, use a stethoscope and examine skin lesions with specialized cameras. The cost of those setups have decreased in recent years to about $7,500 each, he said.\nLast year, 140,000 telemedicine visits were conducted -- 45,000 of which were mental health-related and another 45,000 of which were primary care interactions. Murray\u2019s goal is to increase the share of telemedicine-based primary care visits from less than 15 percent today to 75 percent in the next five years.\nWithout a telehealth program, TDCJ would have to either transport inmates to doctors\u2019 offices or hire more doctors to go to the prisons -- neither of which is simple, Murray said. \u201cWhere some of these facilities are located, there\u2019s no psychiatrist in a 100-mile radius, so how do we get someone to go there? It was always a struggle trying to figure out solutions,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s offered an extra $40,000 per year in pay to attract doctors to rural prisons and turned to agencies to provide physicians, but that costs considerably more than a telemedicine encounter, Murray said. \u201cJust on the provider end, it saves the state $2.5 million every year with us not having to use agency physicians,\u201d he said.\nTexas is not the only state using EHRs to power telemedicine programs. The Medical University of South Carolina tied video-based visits to its EHR platform and found that integration was key to making sure that videoconferencing with patients doesn\u2019t disrupt providers\u2019 workflow.\n\u201cCare lives in the EHR now,\u201d James T.

Microsoft will no longer release security updates for the OS from this day next year. Extended support for the operating system will end on January 14, 2020.\nFrom that date, Windows 7 will be a very interesting target for cybercriminals. About 37% of all desktop computers currently runs Windows 7, and when they no longer receive security updates it\u2019s a matter of time before criminals will exploit new vulnerabilities that won\u2019t be patched anymore.\nWindows 7 was first released in 2009, and Microsoft ended mainstream support for the OS in January 2015. From then on, the Redmond software giant no longer added new features to the OS, but continued to provide security updates. A period Microsoft calls Extended Support.\nOnly enterprise customers can continue to receive security patches, but only if they have a special contract with Microsoft. For regular users there is no known way to get updates anymore.\nWe\u2019re writing \u201cno known way\u201d, as when Extended Support ended for Windows XP in April 2014, some smart users found a way to continue to receive XP updates. This was possible because Microsoft continued to release updates for Windows Embedded POSReady 2009. This is a Windows XP based OS, designed for Point of Service usage.\nBy changing some registry settings in a regular Windows XP installation, the same security patches as Windows Embedded POSReady could be installed. It\u2019s unclear whether this still works, but Microsoft reports on its website that Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 continues to receive updates till April 9 this year.\nThere is also a Windows Embedded PosReady version based on Windows 7 of which extended support ends in December 2021. So far it\u2019s unknown whether there\u2019s also a registry hack that would allow regular Windows 7 systems to receive PosReady 7 updates. We also think that it wouldn\u2019t be very likely.\nMicrosoft hopes Windows 7 users will upgrade to Windows 10. With the release of that OS, Microsoft offered Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users the possibility to upgrade to Windows 10 for free. The company likely hoped most users would upgrade, but until the end of 2018, there continued to be more Windows 7 systems than Windows 10. Therefore, there are now hundreds of millions of Windows 7 computers that need to upgrade to Windows 10 or move to another OS, such as macOS or Linux.\nUnless Microsoft offers another new free upgrade period, Windows 7 users will have to pay $139 for Windows 10 Home or $199 for Windows 10 Pro in the Microsoft Store.\nThere is another option to pay less for Windows 10, websites like G2Play sell Windows 10 Home for $27.35 /\u20ac23.99 and Windows 10 Pro for $29.63/\u20ac25.99. (Get 3% additional discount with HFHNAX5Y). These are so-called OEM licenses and once activated they cannot be transferred to another PC.\nOnce Windows 10 is installed, the system will continue to receive security updates as long as the bi-annual large Windows 10 updates continue to be installed. After such an update is released, Microsoft promises it will continue to release security updates for that version for 18 months."}

Since then, he\u2019s added more than 30 offers, with schools such as Louisville, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee and Vanderbilt offering a scholarship to the Sunshine State standout.\nHis hot streak has coincided with a busy offseason workout program that has seen him add nearly 20 pounds of muscle since last season ended.\nIn-state ACC power Miami is the latest school to host Brahms on a visit, but he plans on hitting up a few more schools in the coming weeks and months.\nAs impressive as his feats on the field are, Brahms is also getting it done in the classroom.\nBrahms reports a 4.5 GPA with tentative plans to major in either business or engineering. He also noted that it is possible that he could arrive at the school of his choice in January as an early enrollee.\nWhile he doesn\u2019t have a concrete timeline on announcing his commitment, it\u2019s a safe bet that the interest in his recruitment and decision will continue to swell in the near future.\nThe attention is already surging, and his status as an unrated recruit is almost certain to change in a hurry.\nUPDATE: As of 1:00 pm CT on April 13, Brahms' rating has been adjusted, and he's now a 4-star offensive guard and the No. 189 player overall in the 247Sports composite ratings.\nSanjay Kirpalani is a National Recruiting Analyst for Bleacher Report.

Anthony List, its well-meaning pledge is overly broad and would have unintended consequences. That is why I could not sign it. It is one thing to end federal funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood; it is entirely another to end all federal funding for thousands of hospitals across America. That is precisely what the pledge would demand and require of a president who signed it.\"\nThe Susan B. Anthony List pounced, issuing a statement condemning only Romney. It read in part, \"Gov. Romney refused to take the pledge, and his explanation raises more questions than answers. In good conscience, we cannot let this rest.\"\nOn Sunday, SBA seemed to be at pains to play down any conflict with Romney. SBA spokesman Billy Valentine e-mailed me: \"Defunding hospitals has never been considered by Congress, is not part of public debate and is not part of the pledge. Ninety-five percent of abortions are performed outside of hospitals. We made this clear to the Romney campaign.\"\nSBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser then e-mailed, saying that she had spoken with the Romney campaign to try to clarify the pledge. She denied that there was any attempt to damage Romney and stated, \"Romney has been an ally of mine/ours since the last election. His not signing came after a sincere effort to clarify intent and convince him to sign.\"\nThe Romney campaign declined to comment further. I can imagine that the last thing the campaign wants to do is gin up a fight with a group that's already caused a stir. However, the points raised by Romney (its overbroadness on providers and its impact on executive branch appointees) remain in the pledge. It is baffling that SBA, if it intended to qualify and limit the pledge, didn't redraft and recirculate it. What is the point of a pledge that says one thing but is interpreted privately in a different way?\nThis is one jumbo example of why these pledges should be dropped in the wastebasket rather than candidates' laps.

(NASDAQ:SSRI) reacted to the commodity downturn like most in the precious metals industry -- it cut costs. The overall performance of the company is pretty impressive on this front, too. However, it's the little things that added up to big savings. Here's a quick analysis of what Silver Standard did right at one of its key mines.\nBetween 2014 and 2016 Silver Standard was able to reduce its cash costs per gold equivalent ounce from $810 to $653. That's an impressive 24% decrease in the underlying cost of operating its mines. This is the biggest piece of all-in sustaining costs, a broader measure that includes the capital spending needed to sustain production. For example, Silver Standard's all-in sustaining costs at its Marigold mine were up 7% year over year in 2016, partly because of the construction of a new leach pad. Cash costs, meanwhile, were roughly 6.5% lower.\nImage source: Silver Standard Resources Inc.\nSo cash costs can give you a good idea of how efficiently a miner is running its mines. But it's important to remember that cash costs are a top-level number; there's a lot that goes on underneath that figure. This is why it's worth looking at some of the little things that Silver Standard has been doing, to see how they've added up to a 24% difference between 2014 and 2016.\nOne of the little changes that Silver Standard implemented is known as a \"hot shift change.\" That sounds a lot more exciting than it really is, but it helped the company reduce its hauling costs by 23% between 2014 and 2016 at its Marigold mine. What used to happen during a shift change was that drivers would turn off their vehicles, with the thought that it would reduce wear and tear on the engines and save fuel. However, engine technology has advanced notably, and now the trucks are left running while the shifts change. This ultimately reduces equipment downtime and, thus, increases productivity. Leaving trucks running sounds like a silly thing, but the savings clearly add up.\nAnother notable change was the decision to reduce the number of drills the company used at Marigold from six to four. With less gear, Silver Standard was forced to use its remaining drills more efficiently, effectively getting more out of each machine. The impact was a 17% reduction in the cost per foot drilled.\nSilver Standard's costs have been moving steadily lower, helping improve margins as precious-metals prices head higher. Image source: Silver Standard Resources Inc.\nSilver Standard also changed its blasting patterns, blasting products, and loading sequence at Marigold. How things work together at a mine is a giant jigsaw puzzle. You or I might view it as a logistical nightmare trying to figure out what needs to be where and when. But moving the pieces around a little helped the miner trim its blasting costs by 24% between 2014 and 2016. An outsider might not even notice the logistics change, but it obviously led to impressive results.\nThe last interesting change involved transferring the skills of a key employee to peers. The company asked the most effective shovel operator at Marigold to help train the other shovel operators, sharing best practices. It was another small change, but one that led to a 13% drop in the rope-"}

Not the day for Indian badminton!\nKidambi Srikanth goes into the mid-game break with a gap of three points after trailing Chou Tien Chen 4-10 in the second game. Back-end errors by the Indian and some brilliant defensive strokes by Chou in the second game.\nSrikanth bridges the gap between him and his opponent by reducing it to two points. Not a very strong start by the Srikanth though. He really needs to turn this game around if he wants to go ahead.\nChou Tien Chen comes from 8-10 down to win the first game against Kidambi Srikanth 21-14 in 16 minutes. Srikanth falls back after the break to let the game slip away from his hands. He now needs to win the second game in hope of dragging the match into the third game for any hope of advancing to the next level.\nGame point! The Taiwan shuttler has built a strong six-point lead and is a point away from winning the game. Some smart shots by Chou Tien gives him the edge after the mid-break. Srikanth tries to make a comeback but is it too little too late now?\nChou Tien Chen running away with the lead. He wins three points immediately after the first-game break to make it 14-11. Srikanth needs to make a comeback before it is too late.\nSrikanth goes into the mid-game interval trailing Chou Tien Chen by a point. It is a tight start to the first game. Both players doing well to keep the match level.\nThe match is now level at 10"}

On the contrary, Lal thinks the third-year wideout has, to a certain degree, been a victim of circumstance.\nHill, who was drafted in the second round in 2012, has just 45 receptions, 594 yards and four touchdowns in his two seasons. And what makes those numbers even more disappointing is the fact that the Jets have been begging for anyone to assume control out wide for years. The Jets didn\u2019t view Hill as a reach that early in the draft, even though he came from an option offense. The assumption was his raw ability, with the right coaching, would lead to brighter days down the road.\nBut so far, Hill has been operating in darkness. Both of his NFL seasons have ended with him on injured reserve due to bad knees.\nLal, however, said it\u2019s not yet time to sound the panic alarm.\nFans find that tough to swallow considering the Jets traded up to get Hill when two picks later the Chicago Bears drafted impact wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who had 89 catches for 1,421 yards and seven touchdowns last season alone.\nHill, on the other hand, was held without a reception in four games during the 2013 season.\nPrior to OTAs Hill insisted that he\u2019d work very hard during this offseason. He also said a recent growth spurt had pushed him above 6-foot-4, which would only help him going forward.\nBut unlike in previous years the Jets appear to have a lot of talented players fighting for a scant few jobs. Regardless if he was injured in the past, the fact remains that Hill may have blown his best opportunity to entrench himself as a starter. He is now one of 12 receivers on the roster, and with big ticket free agent signing Eric Decker and slot stud Jeremy Kerley all but guaranteed of major playing time, Hill finds himself in a group featuring some veterans and draft picks all fighting for reps and probably four spots, assuming the Jets keep six receivers.\nSo clearly Hill has work to do if he wants to remain a Jet."}

Mark Romanchuk, R-Mansfield, how much he needs and where it should come from, Marchbanks said the department will fall an average $1 billion a year short of revenue over the next decade.\nA penny-per-gallon gasoline tax increase would raise about $67 million per year, of which the state would get $42 million, with the rest going to local governments. So raising $1 billion for the state would require a gas tax hike of about 24 cents a gallon.\nMarchbanks declined to recommend a revenue source.\n\u201cWe are facing a future where we will clearly not be able to maintain the quality of the system we have, let alone improve upon it,\u201d he said.\nLawmakers are waiting to see if that better solution from Gov. Mike DeWine includes a significant increase in the state gas tax as part of the new two-year transportation budget. House Republicans kicked off hearings on the not-yet-introduced spending bill, which must be passed and signed by the end of March.\nDeWine has not indicated when he will introduce his plan. A committee he formed to make recommendations on additional road and bridge revenue is expected to recommend a higher gas tax on Friday.\nOhio\u2019s 28-cents-per-gallon gas tax was last increased in 2005, but Marchbanks said a dollar from 2003 is now worth just 58 cents because of inflation. Ohio has gotten by in recent years from other money infusions, such as the federal stimulus package or, more recently, $1.5 billion raised through bonding against future turnpike tolls.\nThat turnpike money is now all accounted for, leaving no money for major new road construction projects, such as certain phases of the I-71/I-70 interchange. The state, Marchbanks said, also kicked $150 million in maintenance work into the future to balance the current budget.\nMarchbanks stressed that revenue options should not include additional debt. The state is already paying a hefty debt load, he said \u2014 $390 million this year, largely because of prior borrowing against future gas tax revenue.\nThat is money, he said, that could be used to fund dozens of projects.\nLocal governments also are feeling the impact, Marchbanks said.\nRep. Jack Cera of Bellaire, the committee's top-ranking Democrat, said more research is needed into the $1 billion shortfall figure, but it\u2019s clear that Ohio needs to raise more transportation money, especially for local governments.\n\u201cI give the administration credit for stepping up and identifying the need, but we want to see what their solutions are,\u201d he said.\nNoting his concern about the amount of debt payments, Cera worries that the issue won\u2019t be properly handled.\n\u201cWe have this era of term limits, and we also have this era of not being willing to address major policy issues if they have a cost,\u201d he said."}

The bar closed in June for the renovation as the last stage of a complete overhaul of the golf club.\nAshford, who also owns Locust Valley Country Club, wanted to start fresh with a new name when he unveiled the updated tavern.

The hype eventually boiled away. The Internet of Things turned out to be vaporware.\nUntil the past few years, that is, when the landscape shifted from below.\nHackers began using increasingly inexpensive sensors and open source hardware\u2014like the Arduino controller\u2014to add intelligence to ordinary objects. There are now kits that let your plants tweet when they need to be watered and teensy printers that scour the web and print out stuff you might be interested in. And there are oodles of \"quantified-self\" projects: \"I know a guy who put a tilt sensor in his beer mug.

One Salesforce.com employee uses If This Then That to sound an alarm if his company's stock price drops below $100.\nIndeed, the garage-born Internet of Things isn't all whimsy and cats. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, many Japanese worried that the government wasn't providing adequate data on areas outside the evacuation zone.

Soon there were more than 300 jury-rigged all over the country, so the public could see real-time radiation levels. \"It was the largest nongovernmental radiation-monitoring network in Japan,\" says Chris \"Akiba\" Wang, one of the hackers. A similar example recently emerged in earthquake-prone Chile, where a student modded a seismometer to tweet its readings. It quickly amassed more than 300,000 followers, who were grateful for the early alerts.\nIn essence, the Internet of Things is happening because it has reached the \"Apple II stage.\" This is the moment when a new technology finally becomes easy enough to use that thousands of people start doing experiments to scratch a personal itch\u2014like Sande with"}

Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (UNKNOWN:CMCSK.DL) posted encouraging quarterly results on Wednesday morning, and it could mean a strong showing out of Disney (NYSE:DIS) when it steps up to the plate to deliver fresh financials next week.\nComcast and Disney compete on more than one playing field. Theme park fans know how fierce the battle between Disney World and Comcast's Universal Orlando is in Florida, a fight that will only intensify in California when Universal Studios Hollywood opens The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in two months within a reasonable drive of Disneyland.\nDisney and Comcast also trade punches as two of the major network operators. Disney owns ABC. Comcast owns NBC. Then we get to the film studios, where Disney and Universal scored all six of last year's highest-grossing movies based on domestic box-office receipts, with three movies apiece.\nKnowing all of this leaves Disney investors paying attention to Comcast's strong quarterly showing this morning, and thankfully, the good news for Comcast won't necessarily be coming at Disney's expense.\nLet's start with the nugget that's been making headline waves around the financial news market: Comcast had its strongest quarter for video customer net additions in more than eight years. Comcast closed out 2015 with 22.383 million cable television accounts, 89,000 more than it had just three months earlier. That tally has been negative more often than it's been positive in recent years as millennials \"cut the cord\" and rely on streaming services or other forms of in-home entertainment.\nThis is great news for Comcast, of course. Cable television is its flagship business. However, this is also welcome news for Disney. Disney owns many cable properties, including Disney Channel and ESPN. It was actually a slide in ESPN subscribers that sent Disney stock lower this summer. An uptick at Comcast doesn't mean ESPN subscribers are climbing again. If Comcast merely took market share from other cable and satellite television providers, it would be a zero-sum game. However, it does offer hope that the perpetual decline in premium TV accounts may have bottomed out, if not started to turn around. That's a pretty big deal for Disney since a lot of its ESPN content is in the form of long-term contracts, where costs inch higher with every passing year.\nThen we get to Comcast's theme parks division. The media giant just topped $1 billion in theme park revenue for the first time in a single quarter, 39% ahead of where it was during the prior year's holiday quarter. The growth wasn't all organic; more than half of that growth came from the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan, but back that out, and theme park revenue still climbed 15.5% for the quarter. Most of that money is being made in Universal Orlando, and what's good for Harry Potter can also be good for Mickey Mouse.\nThe magnetic nature of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- the ambitious expansion that has added themed lands to both of Universal Orlando's theme parks (and will roll out in California on April 7) -- is that it's drawing tourists to Central Florida. They'll stay for about a week, and that means checking out more attractions than just Universal Orlando until Comcast builds out its resort more in the"}

The latter, Frommer's says, was once the exclusive summertime playground of blue-collar locals, but Cesme's beaches are now a popping destination for international vacationers. A few of these beaches are notably bigger and better-appointed than their undeveloped, unnamed counterparts.\nDominated by the sprawling Babylon Alacati Beach Club, the hilly shoreline of Alacati Bay presents a choice: either spread a towel on the windy beach or pay a few lire for a club day pass. Once inside, visitors enjoy a well-appointed facility, well-stocked with water toys and comfy chairs. When playtime is over, the club's restaurants serve a steady supply of Turkish mezes, and the on-site nightclub invites visitors to boogie down.\nBy far the most crowded strip of sand in Cesme, mile-long Ilica Beach is outfitted with a bustling marina, strollable breakwater and crowd of seafood restaurants clustered along its landward side. Divers can remount their launches from a series of metal ladders that extend into the water, and hot-springs aficionados can enjoy a natural fount that bubbles into the protection of a rock-ringed nook tucked into one side of the marina.\nWhite-sand beaches are not the norm in Turkey, but Cesme's snowy Pirlanta Beach is one of these. It owes its baby-softness to the constant wind that buffets tirelessly against the beach's rocks. While not necessarily pleasant for sunbathing, the compressed wind that pumps along the beautiful beach has attracted a bevy of kite-surfing athletes, a few of whom founded an English-language school on the beachfront to teach newbies how to practice the sport.\nAltinkum means \"golden,\" a reference to the cheerful color of this beach's soft sand. Easily accessed from minibuses in Cesme city center, Altinkum Beach is about 5 miles from town -- and well worth the trip. Its unusually cool, clear water and lack of pressing crowds make for a tranquil experience that's somewhat unique in the area. Somnolent attendants rent lounge chairs and umbrellas for a small, cash fee, and a beach snack bar serves up drinks and provisions.\nIf you're looking for a tasting menu of area beaches, sign up for one of the seemingly hundreds of boat tours offered by tour operators on the Cesme waterfront. Hosted on the boats parked colorfully in the Cesme marina, these tours toodle around the local Aegean, occasionally disgorging guests for swimming, snorkeling or short explorations of the area's many inlets and islands. Boat tours are a coastal-Turkey classic and are similar everywhere; from Cesme, they generally include stops at the aptly named Donkey Island, the Blue Lagoon and the Black Island.

{"idx": "33615", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A chipset maker's controversial decision to intentionally disable illegal copies of one of its products via a Windows software update could have implications for operators of critical infrastructure equipment.\nFuture Technology Devices Inc. (FTDI) is the UK manufacturer of a popular USB-to-serial converter for enabling USB support on legacy peripherals. The company's technology is used widely within the critical infrastructure and healthcare sectors, as well as in many test equipment and consumer products.\nFTDI recently released a software update that essentially \"bricked,\" or disabled, counterfeit copies of one of its chips running on products from numerous manufacturers.\nThe Windows driver update was designed to reset the product IDs used by clone manufacturers to identify their chipsets, making the products unidentifiable to the operating system and therefore useless.\n\"This isn't a case where fake FTDI chips won't work if plugged into a machine running the newest FTDI driver,\" Brian Benchoff wrote on Hackaday.com. \"The latest driver bricks the fake chips, rending them inoperable with any computer,\" including Windows, Linux, and OS X systems.\nFTDI's move was apparently designed to discourage clone manufacturers from profiting illegally from the company's intellectual property.\nAccording to Hackaday's Benchoff, the chip that the FTDI driver disabled is one of the most cloned pieces of silicon on Earth.\nIn May, FTDI CEO Fred Dart warned that FTDI was committed to taking \"appropriate measures\" to detect and detect counterfeit activity involving its products.\nStill, the company's decision to brick chips in the field surprised many, because it targeted end users of the technology and not the actual clone manufacturers.\nAs Hackaday noted, it's very hard for consumers and even manufacturers of USB-to-serial conversion technologies to tell if the chips they are using are genuine or counterfeit just by looking at them.\nReid Wightman, an analyst with Digital Bond, a consultancy that specializes in critical infrastructure and industrial control system security, cited reports that FTDI's process for identifying counterfeit devices was imperfect, resulting in the update killing legitimate chipsets, as well.\nIt is basically impossible for end users to know whether every FTDI chip in the USB devices they own is legitimate, Wightman said in a blog post. \"Cables using FTDI chips often come included with hardware that has a serial port, such as network switches, [programmable logic controllers], and other embedded devices.\"\nOften the chips come integrated in devices with USB ports, making it even harder for users to know if the chips are fake or genuine. As a result, FTDI's driver update could create critical infrastructure problems for owners of such devices, he said.\n\"The concern with critical infrastructure equipment is that older equipment -- which still makes up an unfortunate amount of control systems -- often have only a serial interface for configuration,\" Wightman said in emailed comments to InformationWeek. Newer computers no longer have serial ports, so engineers frequently use USB-to-serial cables to gain life from old gear. \"I would worry if an engineer bricked all of his or her USB-to-serial adapters and could not reconfigure one of these old pieces of equipment in an emergency.\"\nOne example would be if a control systems group needed to reconfigure the network in a hurry to set up switch ports for a virtual LAN or to disable MAC address restrictions. Often, the only way to reconfigure an older switch in an emergency is to connect directly to the switch with a serial cable. But if the cable has been bricked by the FTDI update, it won't be possible to reconfigure the system, W"}

Always \"quick to take violent offense,\" as one biographer noted, Early hit back hard when one of the secession leaders, young John Goode Jr. from neighboring Bedford County, accused him of misrepresenting the sentiments of Franklin voters. Mutual friends interceded to prevent a duel, but the two continued to spar on the convention floor. Early continued to insist -- and with good basis for doing so -- that \"the masses of the people of Virginia\" repudiated Richmond's noisy secessionist mobs.\nOn April 13 -- the day after Confederates in South Carolina fired the first shots of the war -- Early commended Major Robert Anderson's \"gallant devotion to duty\" and announced that his heart was \"bound down with sorrow\" to find that any Virginian dared to rejoice at Anderson's having been forced to \"lower the flag of his country.\" In Early's eyes, Anderson was \"the hero of Fort Sumter.\" The two had known each other since West Point -- Anderson was an artillery instructor when Early was a student. John Goode saw the situation quite differently.\nHe called for a Confederate army to liberate eastern Virginia from Black Republican oppression -- and from \"the powers that, perchance, may lie West of the Allegheny mountains.\" Showing that the bad blood between them still festered, Early immediately aimed a sharp barb at \"the gentleman who claims to be of the states rights school,\" but who now would welcome an invading army to overturn majority sentiment in Virginia. Goode, he sneered, \"was not only going to secede from the Union, but to secede from the State of Virginia.\"\nSlave owners had more control over the state government of South Carolina than of any other state, blending aristocratic traditions with democracy. South Carolina's plantation owners played the role of English aristocrats more than the planters of other states, whereas newer Southern states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, allowed more political equality among whites. Although all white male residents were allowed to vote, property restrictions for office holders were higher in South Carolina than in any other state. South Carolina had the only state legislature where slave owners had the majority of seats. It was the only state where the legislature elected the governor, all judges and state electors. The state's chief executive was a figurehead who had no authority to veto legislative law.\nThe majority of the population in South Carolina was black: by 1860 the population of the state was 703,620, with 57 percent or slightly more than 402,000 classified as enslaved African Americans. Free blacks numbered slightly less than 10,000. Unlike Virginia, where most of the plantations and slaves were concentrated in the eastern part of the state, in South Carolina plantations and slaves were common throughout most of the state. After 1794, Eli Whitney's cotton gin allowed cotton plantations to grow throughout South Carolina. By 1830, 85 percent of inhabitants of rice plantations along the coast were slaves. When rice planters left the malarial low country for cities such as Charleston, up to 98 percent of the low country residents were slaves. By 1830, two-thirds of South Carolina's counties had populations with 40 percent or more enslaved; in the two counties with the lowest rates of slavery, 23 percent of the population were slaves.\n"}

In addition, the president's campaign web site posted about twice as many blog posts and more than twice as many online videos, the study found.\nObama's campaign also surpasses Romney in terms of Twitter followers and Facebook likes by a margin of 13:1. The study suggests the margin could be wider due to the fact that after Romney's number of followers suddenly spiked by 141,000 in two days, it was discovered that they were mechanically generated.\nRomney does have the edge when it comes to base enthusiasm, the study notes, with 87 percent of Republicans following election news closely, compared to 79 percent of Democrats, according to a Gallup poll published this week. And while the party is on a bit of a high over his choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as a running mate, Team Romney may want to reach out and tweet a whole lot more somebodies.\n\u2014 Both candidates' digital campaigns have focused on the economy more than any other issue; 24% of all Romney posts and 19% of Obama posts were about the economy. However, the campaigns differed in the angle they stressed. The Romney campaign devoted nearly twice the attention to jobs in its posts \u201414% of posts compared to 8% of posts from the Obama campaign. Obama's economic messages were almost equally divided between jobs and broader economic issues, such as the importance of the middle class.\n\u2014 The economy may have dominated both candidates' digital messaging, but other issues \u2014 such as immigration and health care \u2014 were far more likely to spur re-sharing by their digital audience. Obama's posts about the economy generated an average of 361 shares or retweets. His posts about immigration, by comparison, generated more than four times that, and women's and veteran's issues generated more than three times the reaction. This was also true of Romney's messaging. His posts on health care and veterans averaged almost twice the response per post of his economic messages.\n\u2014 Neither candidate offered much sharing or retweeting of its followers' messages. If the Internet offers the promise of making campaigns more of a two-way conversation with citizens, the candidates are not participating. For example, just 16% of Obama's tweets over the two-week period studied were retweets. The Romney campaign had just one retweet during this period \u2014 something from Romney's son Josh.\n\u2014 Obama's digital strategy targets specific voter groups to a greater degree than Romney's. Visitors to Obama's website are offered opportunities to join 18 different constituency groups, among them African-Americans, women, LGBT, Latinos, veterans/military families or young Americans. If a visitor clicks to join a group, they then receive content targeted to that constituency. The Romney campaign offered no such groups at the time of this study. It has since added feature pages for nine groups, although users can still only join the general \"Team Romney\" rather than the particular voter group."}

Jason is in fifth grade and he\u2019s a real livewire, a trait that\u2019s put him neck deep in hot water more than once. He lives with his mom, visits his dad on weekends, and generally runs our neighborhood whenever he\u2019s in town. Jason\u2019s a good kid at heart but with a lack of strong role models the poor kid is easily influenced by whomever he\u2019s near.\nWhen the principal came in, he read the various reports on Jason\u2019s behavior that day. In the hallway before school he\u2019d called the Blevins girl a \u201cfat pig,\u201d he made fun of Jamie Richards in social studies by saying that since she was female she was just a \u201cbimbo,\u201d when Mr. Andrews showed a PowerPoint presentation of the human digestive system Jason had mumbled \u201cpervert,\u201d and by noon he\u2019d called four of his classmates liars. Lunch hour found our little rascal in the gym making fun a boy with a limp, and when he was reprimanded he called his supervisor a \u201cdummy.\u201d As he was escorted out of the gym he mentioned that the gym teacher should sue her plastic surgeon. That afternoon, he reportedly made several lewd comments to the girls in his class and told one girl that she had a really ugly face.\nAnd so Jason sat in front of the principal, Mr. Webber, that afternoon, without seemingly any good excuse for being such an idiot.\nMr. Webber was not of the old school \u201cpunish \u2018em until they come around,\u201d because he\u2019d seen the failing results of that sort of counseling. He thought that for once he\u2019d try to understand what was going on inside Jason\u2019s brain, and began with, \u201chow\u2019s your day, Jason?\u201d Jason mumbled something. His only desire was to get this over with, get suspended for a few days and go home, but Mr. Webber wouldn\u2019t give up.\nIt was Mr. Webber\u2019s time to stop and reflect a bit as he glanced down at the various slips of paper listing Jason\u2019s transgressions that day \u2026 name-calling, picking on the weak, seeking to damage reputations \u2014 fat pig, plastic surgeon, dummy, pervert, bimbo.\nWhere had he heard this before? The principal considered for a moment that perhaps he had the wrong miscreant sitting in front of him. He gave Jason a stern warning, two days out of school suspension, and then went home that night wondering if it was possible for a 10-year-old boy to be influenced by public debate. He sat down with his family to a meal of Kentucky Fried and turned on the news. CNN was playing reruns of the last presidential debate, and after just a few seconds Webber got up and shut off the TV. He wasn\u2019t about to let his children hear that sort of language at supper.\nThe story may be a bit apocryphal but it\u2019s not that hard to envision and day in the near future where a young behavior problem sits in front of a school administrator, perhaps with his parents and lawyer in tow, and gives a defense for his bullying, citing the fact that a presidential contender used similar tactics. I think back to my days in sixth grade where my desk sat facing the portraits of Lincoln and Washington. I\u2019m sure it was a part of the school\u2019s plan that I would adopt the character traits of those statesmen.\nI shudder to imagine what will happen to the kid sitting in my old desk in two years."}

In many areas, water lapped up against houses and left cars stranded. The water was being driven higher by south winds as Isaac passed to the west and was expected to continue rising through the night.\nFloodwaters rose waist-high in some neighborhoods, and the Louisiana National Guard was working with sheriff's deputies to rescue people stranded in their homes and surprised by the flooding.\nThe floodwaters \"were shockingly fast-rising, from what I understand from talking to people.

Bobby Jindal's office said up to another 1,500 more were expected to leave their homes.\nDardenne said officials speculated that the fortifying of levees in other parishes along Lake Pontchartrain after Hurricane Katrina forced storm surge into new areas that had escaped flooding in past storms.\n\"The water's got to go somewhere, and this is where it went,\" he said.\nJindal's top coastal adviser, Garret Graves, said he thought the theory was unlikely to be the cause of the extensive flooding.\n\"My personal opinion, based on the science, was if it did have any impact, it would be minimal,\" Graves said.\nHe said years of wetlands erosion has lessened the resistance to wave energy, allowing stronger storm surge to push farther inland. Also, Graves said even though previous storms like Katrina didn't inundate St. John the Baptist Parish, every hurricane has its own impact in areas surrounded by water.\n\"This one traveled slower, it had different wind, it had different surge. It was a different storm,\" he said.\nThe Department of Wildlife and Fisheries had 30 boats in LaPlace and 20 more on the way to get people out of their homes, and the state sent 89 buses to take them to shelters in Alexandria and Shreveport, and to evacuate an assisted living facility. The National Guard had seven high-water vehicles in the parish and another 25 - as well as ten boats - on the way Wednesday night to assist the parish evacuation efforts.\nWith one water district flooded, the National Guard also was sending two 5,000-gallon water tankers and 35,000 bottles of water to distribute to residents.

They'll be walking in the front rows and then the reporters will have an opportunity to ask some questions.\nSara, stay with us. We're going to get back to you shortly.\nGloria Borger is our chief political analyst.\nIt will be curious to see which American reporters are asked - allowed to ask questions because presumably the White House could determine who gets to ask those questions. And they presumably don't want certain questions, like the future of the National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a question like that to be asked.\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Probably not. And as we know at the last such gathering with Abe, the president called on two people who were owned by - who work for Rupert Murdoch-owned organizations, and he seemed to get a little peeved when one of those journalists actually did ask an off topic question. So he knows that that's what journalists are going to ask.\nAnd the thing we're all going to be watching for is whether in fact NAFTA does come up because it wasn't in their joint statement and there are disagreements about NAFTA.

My guess is their real world view from their house is a pleasant one that can afford the incremental pace and narrow benefits of what they are promoting by this article.\nGrunwald's case seems built on the past events from Obama's failure to get his stimulus package thru both houses with his own attached 'green deal' component without pleasing a few hold out democrats and republicans.

Obama, for instance, never really tooted his own horn. The Republicans, on the other hand, do, and its worked for them.\nPerhaps the solution is to have the Dems get schooled in horn tooting?\nThe United States was setup so that the majority would rule and run it all.

But will that stand up in court? Former Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna weighed in.\n\u201cA president is required to cite particular provisions of law that authorize him to take the steps he wants to take under a national emergency,\u201d McKenna told KIRO Radio\u2019s Dave Ross on Seattle\u2019s Morning News.\nThe original law allowing a president to declare a state of national emergency was first adopted in 1976. Technically, there are 31 total \u201cemergencies\u201d ongoing, including one issued shortly after 9/11 in 2001.\nIn total, there have been 58 states of emergency declared since 1979. What could be different about one for Trump\u2019s wall, though, is that a state of emergency has never been met with a Congressional challenge.\nThe process Congress can employ is\u2026 well, complicated to say the very least, and was made that way by a 1983 Supreme Court ruling.\nAs McKenna explains it: Congress can revoke a state of emergency, but thanks to that 1983 ruling, any revocation then needs to be signed by the president in order to go into effect. If the president denies Congress, it then takes a two-thirds vote from both the House and Senate to overturn the president\u2019s veto. Only after all that could a state of emergency be stopped by Congress.\nThe other option is a court challenge, but if things come to that, McKenna noted that the president has a significant leg up.\nBy the time a federal court does step in, the president could potentially get a lot done, with executive authority granting him significant power in any such situation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what (the president is) allowed to do, is to state his reasoning and his judgment, [and] essentially dare Congress and the courts to stop him,\u201d said McKenna.\nAs for where Trump plans on getting the money for his wall specifically, a recent report from the Associated Press says that the White House has instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to pull from the billions of dollars earmarked for Puerto Rico\u2019s disaster response in 2018.\nFor now, said McKenna, the president could very well be making preparations to circumvent any legal challenge that might come his way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a political calculation, or he\u2019s waiting to get all the legal ducks lined up, making sure he can find pots of money that are sufficient to build as much as he wants to build,\u201d he said."}

Her husband, Lt. Gen. Jack Stultz, is the Army Reserve commander. She said that while the Army Strong Community Centers have been very successful since they first opened in 2009, they\u2019ve had to scale back their plans for the next year to bring the total open to six instead of eight.\nYou can read the rest of my story about that on Military.com.\nIt\u2019s a mystery to me as to why it has taken DoD such an incredibly long time (as in -- the entire history of the Reserve) to put support centers in communities far removed from traditional bases or reserve facilities. It also seems to be a mystery to Mrs. Stultz who, along with her husband, has championed the idea since he took command in 2006.\nSince we first brought you news of the Reserve centers late last year, a new one has opened in Oregon City, Ore. This one is based inside a local college, which Stultz says helps servicemembers connect with their GI Bill benefits.\nFor the two other planned centers Stultz said they want to open another one at a college and, possibly, have a roving team that travels around a specified area. The current centers are located in New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon. That leaves the midwest, southeast and southwest without one.\nI\u2019ll definitely keep you updated as this story continues to develop."}

A few months ago I went cold turkey off of vyvanse because I started having a racing heart and minor palpitations even at the starter dose. Without ADHD medication I do not feel like myself anymore. I know this is most likely because I went off cold turkey but I fear for my health if I continue to take stimulants.\nWithout my stimulant medication I feel like I am in a fog. I think so much that I am unable to sit and focus on anything. My memory also is very bad and I feel unable to experience pleasure. The stimulants had also lifted my symptoms almost completely, making me happy and stablizing my mood. On top of helping me focus which I am seemingly unable to do without them.\nI feel unable to control anything in my life without my ADHD meds. I feel like if this state of mind does not correct itself I will never be ok again. Sorry if this is dramatic.\nMy questions would be: Does anyone have experience with getting off ADHD meds? Is your experience similar? And how can I cope with stimulant withdrawal?\nIt's my understanding that withdrawal from it is psychological. However, I know what you mean about the fog, etc. That usually goes away after a week or two. Eating well and sleeping helps. I'm no medical expert, but I've read that dopamine may need time to naturally replenish after long term stimulant use.\nSweet heart, I have been on stimulants for 10 years and without a drug vacation.\nI completely comprehend what you are going through.\nWhen I suddenly stop as my Doctor retired and didn't see another doc to prescribe me the Dextrostats, I didn't feel like my normal self again.\nWithout Dextrostats, the colors to life morphed into black and white.\nUntil this day, I have to take Wellbutrin and Lexapro to be able to function.\nIn those 10 years, I never used the stimulant as directed. I abused them.\nI couldn't resist feeling the comedowns when I could keep redosing and partying with my friends. At times, I didn't sleep because I would go night clubbing and would dance all night long.\nSo, please be careful about considering taking other forms of amphetamines because they are habit forming. Also, not everyone has addicting personalities and would take them as prescribed.\nI surely hope your are doing well.\nYes absolutely. I feel that miserable fog sometimes waking up in the AM waiting for the drug to kick in.\nI took a job across the country and was unable to get into see a doctor and get my meds for over a month. It was a nightmare. On top of the job, and moving I ended out getting into a car accident and totaling my car. Wasn\u2019t my fault, but if id had my meds my I could have swerved faster. That month of not having meds created a snowball that just grew and grew. By the time I got back on it was too late and I knew it. So I made a deal with the owners and quietly left.\nI know that I don\u2019t think clearly without medication. I am impulsive, hypersensitive, obnoxious, easily distracted, disorganized, prone to extreme spending and kind of a jerk. For these reasons, it\u2019s not an option to not have the medication.\n1.

However, those who take the time to explore the offshore areas of this small city will discover a fascinating historical district, as well as several other charming neighborhoods.\nThe Sea Front is the postcard representation of Nice: gorgeous beaches and near-limitless luxury. The renowned Promenade des Anglais (Walk of the English), which runs parallel to the coast separates most of the area\u2019s beachfront from its businesses. This famous street boasts numerous top-notch hotels and restaurants that offer spectacular views of the pebbly beaches and cerulean waves of the Mediterranean Sea. The Sea Front neighborhood is always crowded with tourists and residents, who pass the time strolling along the coast and enjoying the fresh sea breeze.\nMost Ni\u00e7ois refer to Place Mass\u00e9na as the heart of Nice. It is located east of Sea Front at the point where Promenade des Anglais (Walk of the English) becomes Quai des Etats-Unis. The square and its surrounding streets are home to the city's more upscale shops and boutiques, including the Galeries Lafayette and the Nicetoile Shopping Center (Centre Commercial Nicetoile). If you need a break from the hustle and bustle of the shopping streets, escape to one of Mass\u00e9na's two parks. The Jardin Albert I, which sit off of the Promenade des Anglais, features examples of contemporary sculpture; the Mass\u00e9na Gardens (La Place Mass\u00e9na), east of the square, offers a serene setting for lazy strolls.\nAs its name implies, Vieux-Nice (Old Town) is the city's historic district. Sitting away from the sea just east of Mass\u00e9na along Quai des Etats-Unis, Vieux-Nice is a maze of narrow streets and baroque architecture, so it is any history buff's dream. This district houses numerous churches, as well as Castle Hill (Colline du Chateau), the site of Nice's first settlement, and the baroque-style Palais Lascaris. Recent travelers recommend paying a visit to the renowned Cours Saleya flower market, which is located just north of the Promenade des Anglais (Walk of the English). Vieux-Nice is also known for having some of the best ice cream parlors in the city, most of them clustered around Place Rossetti, just north of the Cours Saleya market.\nLocated at the eastern end of the Promenade des Anglais (Walk of the English), Nice's Port District is a peaceful alternative to the busy Sea Front. The port itself offers picturesque views of the sea and incoming fishing boats. Although there are several great restaurants tucked away near the docks, the Port District is best known for its abundance of antique shops, especially down Rue Catherine S\u00e9gurane, a small street located just a few blocks southeast of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne et d\u2019Art Contemporain).\nOnce a forgotten part of the city, the Promenade du Paillon district has gone through a renaissance in recent years. Nice's new theater district derives its name from a park at its center, which is located to the north of the Port District. The neighborhood's Palais des Congr\u00e8s Acropolis (Nice Acropolis Convention Center) hosts a wide array of live performances, film screenings and conferences. This area's other major site is the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de Nice, which features productions of both classic and contemporary theater.\nThe"}

The NBA prospect, who averages a double-double, attempted only four shots and grabbed six rebounds in 31 minutes of action against Kansas State.\nA limited Bamba could further derail a Texas team that has leaned on its defense to win games all season. The same defense that held Oklahoma \u2014 the top offensive team in the country \u2014 to a season-low 66 points last Saturday struggled to get stops against Kansas State in the second half.\nAnd while the Longhorns were stalling on the road, their Saturday opponent was earning arguably its biggest win of the season. Oklahoma State caught fire from deep and torched No. 6 Texas Tech in an 80-point victory on Wednesday night in Stillwater. A loss on Saturday for either program would likely be the nail in the coffin for any NCAA Tournament hopes.\nAfter Saturday, the Longhorns have two remaining rematches with two of the Big 12\u2019s best. Contests with top-25 opponents in Kansas and West Virginia to close out the season leave zero room for error as the Longhorns look for answers.\nWith or without a full strength Bamba, Texas still needs to find a way to win over the surging Cowboys."}

The deportation of Palestinian prisoners to Israel is also a violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which is about to be ratified.\nThe official signing of the ICCPR which protects Palestinians from arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and ensures fair trials, freedom of expression, conscience, assembly and association as well as the signing of the other treaties and conventions, will, in effect, usher in the Palestinian Spring.\nA Palestinian Spring that is decades overdue since the shameful signing of the Oslo Accords, after which Palestinians were doomed to face, not only Israeli violence, but PA Security Forces oppressing them on behalf of Israel and its brutal occupation.\nThe acceleration of the Palestinian Spring will depend on the empowerment and unity of the whole Palestinian population and this demands groundbreaking change in the status of Palestinian women who are disadvantaged by the double discrimination inflicted on them by both Israel and the PA.\nComprehensively set out in the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network report, Palestinian Women\u2019s Rights in EU-Israel and EU-PA Relations, 2014, are the ways that the PA and Hamas have restricted women\u2019s access to freedom of movement, political participation, decision-making, education, health, employment, and raised the issue of domestic violence including honour killings.

The lottery is designed to get the number of STRs down from 290 to 250 and make it so that only 15 percent of housing per block is dedicated to such rentals.

This isn\u2019t an especially onerous process, but you should understand some of the basic concepts of how the legal system works before you embark on your new venture.\nTo begin, there are several types of corporate structures from which to choose. In U.S. terms, these are: 1) a general partnership, 2) a limited partnership, 3) a limited liability company, and 4) a limited company or corporation. The last, called a Sociedad An\u03ccnima, is by far the most commonly used for business purposes. I\u2019ll briefly define each, and then focus on the Sociedad An\u03ccnima.\nThis type of entity is run by a group responsible for the administration and direction of the enterprise, representing the interests of all shareholders. Their responsibilities are similar to those who run a General Partnership, except for the fact that their liability is limited to the original declared value of the enterprise.\nAs the name \u201cAnonymous Society\u201d implies, these companies are owned by various shareholders, not necessarily named. It is the most flexible and widely used business platform. Shareholders are liable only for their share of ownership. This is my focus below.\nCosta Rican commercial law requires that sociedades an\u03ccnimas have a unique name that cannot be confused with any other company\u2019s name, and it must be followed by the phrase \u201cSociedad An\u03ccnima\u201d or the initials \u201cS.A.\u201d The name can be in any language, as long as the translation of the same into Spanish is included in the firm\u2019s charter. In fact, the meaning of the name has to be specified, or an explanation that the name is simply a flight of the owners\u2019 fantasy.\nThe company name is approved by, and registered with, the Registro de Marcas de Comercio, thus protecting it from use by others, and insuring its commercial value. Even names that appear slightly similar to those of existing companies will be denied. Uniqueness is a high priority in this process.\nIllegal use by third parties of a duly registered name, even if only similar, is punishable by law. Thus, the choice of name is critically important, to avoid misunderstandings, intentional or otherwise, in the future.

Don\u2019t be deceived by the quaint-looking exterior and hand-painted, animal-shaped seats \u2013 this ride is faster than it looks and not for the faint hearted.\nAnother success has been visits by groups of people with dementia, whose memories are awakened by the sounds of the mighty Wurlitzer or the sight of the vintage steam engines and cars from yesteryear.\nThe venue also hosts regular dances, which sees couples gliding round the floor one minute and having a ride on the ghost train or the galloping horses the next.\nScarborough couple Arthur Rosbottom and his wife Brenda, both in their eighties, have been coming to the dances every week for the past eight years. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best venues in England for dancing and for a day out \u2013 and it has one of the best vintage collections in the world I think,\u201d says Arthur.\nAnother regular is local organ society chairman Bernard Blagden, of Hunmanby, who visits every week to enjoy the music with his wife Doreen.\n\u201cThis is the East Coast\u2019s answer to Blackpool Tower \u2013 except we\u2019ve got two Wurlitzers and they only have one!

Coal and coffee prices have also fallen since last year. These factors will mean the average terms of trade for Colombia in 2013 are likely to be lower than in 2012. \u201cBusiness partners of Colombia will probably grow a little less this year than last,\u201d said the central bank.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012 the economy grew 3.1% year-on-year said the central bank while the growth of household consumption was 4% and in line with expectations.

Mexico leads the six-team CONCACAF qualifying table with four wins and two draws for 14 points.\nJamaica goalkeeper Andre Blake was credited with five saves, among his most impressive a two-fisted stop in the 65th minute off a Mexico free kick by Jesus Gallardo.\nTime and again the Jamaica backline thwarted Mexico attacks.\nThe Jamaicans became the first Caribbean side to reach the North American regional tournament final when they upset the US squad 2-1 in the 2015 semifinals and the rematch will give them a chance to make history as champions.\n\u201cWe want to be a top country for CONCACAF, not just Mexico or the US,\u201d Whitmore said.\nBut this US squad is unbeaten in 13 matches since Bruce Arena took over as coach last year from the fired Jurgen Klinsmann, his first of eight wins in the run coming in a 1-0 home friendly over Jamaica last February.\nThe Americans seek a sixth Gold Cup title and their first since 2013."}

Enter Salad and Go, a restaurant chain based in Arizona that is selling healthy meals for less than $6 from a traditional drive-thru window.\n\u201cWe kept saying over and over again, why can\u2019t I just get something great tasting and good for you with the same convenience, speed, and price of traditional drive-thru fast food?\u201d says Roushan Christofellis, who founded the chain in 2013. So, the former elementary school teacher created one. Here, she discusses the inspiration behind her idea and how the Salad and Go concept is evolving.\nWhat inspired you to create Salad and Go?\nOur story started about five years ago. I was just about to turn 30. My husband\u2019s a few years older than me. We both started having our parents deal with some health issues, specifically heart disease, which is really hard, obviously, when you are watching your parents go through [everything from] heart attacks to bypass surgery. It was kind of this unique point where we were seeing our parents as young in our eyes, and we were old enough to know that that\u2019s going to be us very soon. And so that unique perspective made it really clear to us that your health is something not to be taken for granted.\nWe thought that as long as you went to the gym and you [stayed at a] good healthy weight, that meant you were healthy, and what we realized was we were not putting the right food into our bodies and we were really taking our health for granted. So, we started taking a close look at the food we were eating and we did our own research, and we watched movies like Food Matters and Fork Over Knife. And the message became very clear that food is medicine and you are what you eat, and there are these nutrient-rich foods and these healthy fats that we\u2019re really missing from our diets.\nHow did you decide to change your diet?\nWe started first at the grocery store, like, okay, grocery shop, cook from home, control what we\u2019re eating. But it honestly didn\u2019t last long, and I\u2019m sure a lot of people experience this. You\u2019re working full-time, and if you do want to get to the gym or do something after work and have meetings run late, by the time we even got home to start cooking, it was 7 p.m. I\u2019m starving. I just want to eat. The last thing I want to do now is cook.\nWe found ourselves to be almost jealous of those people that would swing through the drive-thru from their air-conditioned car and be done in five minutes. It was frustrating. You either had to succumb to eating traditional drive-thru fast food if you wanted to enjoy the speed and convenience and affordability, or you were able to eat good food.

Kilu sees LHV as what he calls an \"influencer bank\" that wants to actively contribute to the development of new tech in the financial sector.\n\"During the last six years, we have seen a rapid growth in the volume of payment services, and more growth can be predicted, taking into account the impact of the European Payment Services Directive (PSD2) on the financial sector that entered into force this year,\" Kilu said in a press release. \"In order to offer new solutions, the financial intermediaries need banking services, and that means us.\"\nThe bank is currently busy hiring for its new London branch office. The UK branch will be managed by Andres Kitter, who serves as a member of the Management Board of LHV Bank and has so far overseen the servicing of financial service providers.\nIn addition to the branch manager, LHV will recruit customer service specialists and new employees covering compliance and money laundering prevention.

(NASDAQ:AAXN) transform itself from a taser-focused company to a body camera solutions company that also happens to sell tasers. That transformation has turned Axon into a growth stock with the potential to be a mainstay in law enforcement.\n2018 will be a critical year for new product launches as Axon attempts to add value in the body camera market. Here are the key products to watch next year.\nAxon has become the standard for body cameras in law enforcement, which it now plans to leverage to dominate the in-car video market as well. The company has been testing a new Axon Fleet product that will go in vehicles and connect videos to the Evidence.com platform that's been so successful for body cameras.\nFleet will be a key product because it's a line extension for Axon that will be additive for law enforcement. The company doesn't need to find new customers for Axon Fleet, it just needs to get existing customers to adopt the product, which would increase revenue and profit per customer.\nAnother additive product is Signal Sidearm, an attachment that automatically turns on a body camera when a sidearm is removed from its holster. The product will ensure that body cameras are on when they're supposed to be and take the burden of knowing when a situation will require a body camera off officers.\nSignal Sidearm doesn't have the ongoing revenue potential of a body camera or Axon Fleet, which come with cloud services, but it's the kind of product enhancement that makes Axon's platform more valuable for law enforcement.\nThe product that could revolutionize how law enforcement does its work is Axon's upcoming records management system (RMS). This will allow Axon body cameras to be used easily for witness statements, paperwork automation, records sharing, and more. The idea is not only to make it easier to record information about an incident, but also to reduce paperwork that keeps officers out of the field.\nIf Axon's RMS is successful, it'll drive greater adoption of body cameras and other products and make it easy to justify the expense of Axon's products to law enforcement agencies. Long-term, this could be the most consequential product of the year.\nNow that Axon is building a critical mass of customers with body cameras, it's time for it to complete the suite of products needed by law enforcement and start turning its sales into profits. 2018's product launches will go a long way to completing the product suite, which the sales force can leverage to expand revenue per customer. When combined with a slowdown R&D spending growth, we should see profitability increase from its very small base in 2018.\nLong-term, Axon is building the kind of durable business investors should love. That's why I'm keeping a thumbs up CAPSCall on My CAPS page heading into 2018."}

But he receives little else in perquisites. When he stays at a Hyatt, he waits in line to check into his basic guest room -- no Champagne cocktail, no luxurious presidential suite.\nMr. Geoga represents a trend that has been submerged from view by the wave of money companies have allowed to wash over their top officers. Corporate perks -- those prestige-dripping dollops of special treatment -- have often been trimmed back from their lavish levels of the 1980's.\nShed no tears for Mr. Geoga, though. While he declined to discuss what he earns at privately held Hyatt, other than to say it is ''competitive,'' compensation experts estimate that his total package could be as much as $2 million to $4 million, the range for other heads of midsized companies.\nStill, for many executives, extras like corporate jets, chauffeur-driven luxury cars and memberships at exclusive country clubs have fallen by the wayside. Changes in tax laws wiped out or sharply reduced the write-offs that corporations could take for many of them, and companies feel further pressure to hold down costs to help deliver ever-improving earnings. Executive recruiters and compensation consultants also cite a focus on more practical wants and needs in a time that is not as preoccupied with conspicuous consumption.\nThe shift, however, does not necessarily reach into the ranks of chief executives or their very top lieutenants.\nFor example, those on the ''A'' list of chiefs -- like Michael D. Eisner of Walt Disney, John F. Welch of General Electric and Albert J. Dunlap of Sunbeam -- have ''a track record of success, and companies will have to give them what they want,'' said Graef Crystal, a compensation expert in San Diego.\nBut work just a few steps down the ladder of the corporate elite, and the change is striking.\nFor one thing, many of today's corporate leaders have far less time to enjoy fancy extras.\nACCORDING to benefits consultants, today's executives are more worried about the future than about the present, and certain perks reflect the trend. With company takeovers occurring every day, many of these executives do not expect to remain at the helm for 20 years, as their predecessors did.\nThat means, more than anything, that they want cash. Indeed, Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter, found that in 1996, about 59 percent of 1,100 public companies offered executive ''golden parachute'' agreements, up from 41 percent in 1988.\nExecutives are increasingly asking for severance packages of one or two years of salary and benefits, compared with the six months they might customarily receive, said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm in Manhattan. About a third of Mr. Johnson's clients now request these extended packages.\nExecutives also want to know that if they are dismissed without cause or because of a change in management, they will receive a total cash payout for the remainder of their contract.\n''Generally, what we're seeing is some perks being replaced by greater stock options and by higher pay for better company performance,'' said Carl Weinberg, a principal in the compensation practice at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and consulting firm, in Westport,"}

{"idx": "33694", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Why kosher-for-Passover foods cost so much.\nI\u2019m sick and tired of paying $24 for matzo.\nSee a Magnum Photos gallery on Passover.\nLast week I saw a can of tuna for $16.99, a $5 jar of jelly, and a $6 box of cereal. I felt like I was in a foreign country with rampant hyperinflation. Is this really in dollars? Maybe I\u2019m supposed to convert the currency.\nAlas, I wasn\u2019t abroad. I was in the kosher-for-Passover section of an Atlanta grocery store. As observant Jews the world over can tell you, it\u2019s expensive to be one of us. From synagogue dues, to JCC memberships, to Jewish private school tuition, it all starts to add up rather quickly. Kosher meat, for example, costs approximately 20 percent more than nonkosher meat. But Passover takes the cake. (Metaphorically of course\u2014most cake is forbidden on this leaven-free holiday.) In general, Passover food is marked up an additional 20 percent over regular kosher prices, hence the $24 box of matzo I saw at that same grocery. It seems we should add another question to the traditional four associated with Passover: Why is this food so darn expensive?\nIt\u2019s tempting to accuse Manischewitz of price-gouging\u2014but that\u2019s hard to define and even harder to enforce. \u201cA business can charge whatever price it wants for a product,\u201d a spokesperson for New York City\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs told me by phone. The DCA used to send out annual press releases reminding consumers to be extra careful with their Passover shopping and even had a hot line to report problems. But, after not receiving many calls, the DCA stopped this practice a few years ago. More recently, some state attorneys general have filed complaints to little or no avail.\nThe kosher-for-Passover market would seem like a prime business opportunity for someone to come in and completely undersell everyone else. To some extent, that has happened with co-ops cropping up across the nation that offer significant discounts on food ordered in bulk. Furthermore, a number of Israeli-based companies have started producing less expensive products, now available for purchase on many online sites. But those prices are still relatively high. After all, even they know the basic truth of their business: Observant Jews, who are so strict during the eight days of Passover they won\u2019t eat anything else, don\u2019t really have a choice but to buy these products.\nTo many, standing up for the Passover manufacturers is like defending Wall Street bankers. There are, however, a couple of valid reasons for the seasonal markup.\nFirst, most reliable kosher agencies require full-time supervision for Passover production (as opposed to occasional pop-ins by rabbis for year-round kosher items).

The considerations of a priest, whose personal blog has been taken down.\nBeijing (AsiaNews) - \"Once we could consult Vatican News, ucanews.com, AsiaNews.it and others [websites]; now they are blocked\": This is the bitter observation of a Chinese priest, Fr. Peter, after the government's decision to prohibit all websites of evangelization. In reality AsiaNews.it in Chinese has been blocked for several years, although members of the Party often consult it. But the new rules on online evangelization have also erased the priest's blog. Peter seems to suggest that censorship is a traditional element in China: even Confucius stopped writing when a unicorn was killed. That is to say: the violence of censorship reduces hope and gives space to negativity.\nGuan Moye, a native of Gaomi, Shandong province, eastern China, writes with his pseudonym Mo Yan (literally meaning \u2018not to say\u2019). Ironically, he has written many literary works, and above all, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012. Confucius, a great sage and educator of ancient China, had written classical literatures and traveled around the country to promote his thoughts and doctrines. Once a unicorn\uff08or kirin, were a kind of mascot, like dragon\uff09 appeared, but was hunted down, thereafter, Confucius wrote no more.\nRegarding myself, I do not know whom I have angered with my writings or my images. The gallery in my Sina blog was sealed for no reason. I feel upset and helpless. Confucius halted to write because some people had ruined the ecological environment. People did not spare a good-hearted unicorn, but had to hunt it down. From then on, Confucius stopped his writing, and was depressed and grievous until he died.\nToday, 2,500 years after Confucius, civilization should have made substantial progress. Still, people cannot speak and tell others what they want to say. Facing injustices, inequality and un-civilized acts, people remain silent. When I was young, I heard a saying \"to remain silent in the face of injustice is a way of crying out for injustice.\u201d Now I do not remember who created this proverb, and I have become a person who \u201cfaces injustice but chooses to remain silent.\"\nWhen I first succeeding in the registration of a blog in China, I felt happy about it, because I now had a space of my own to express my views. Although there were readers who did not agree to what I said, and even criticized me, but anyway it was a world of diverse opinions. This was so-called \"hundred flowers and hundreds of schools of thought\", an embodiment of social progress and prosperity[i]. If the media, the network, and the cultural carriers are expressed in a unified manner, what kind of form will appear in the realms of culture, belief and religion? I really cannot imagine.\nI once asked an apostate who gave up his faith during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and had no expression of religious belief, \u201cDo you still have faith?\u201d. He was silent for a long time, and said: \"Faith is a deep thing in the human heart.\" Such an answer was very perplexed. In today's society, political enlightenment, economic prosperity, and the Constitution also clearly express \"freedom of belief,\""}

Identifying offensive line depth is a spring goal, and Petrino singled out Sandpoint freshman Carlos Collado III as a standout newcomer. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d Running backs Isaiah Saunders and Aaron Duckworth also caught Petrino\u2019s attention in a good way.\nRedshirt freshman Cade Coffey and sophomore Sam Fenlason both worked at kicker and punter, vying to replace graduated Austin Rehkow. Coffey helped his case by launching impressive back-to-back 50-yard plus punts that rocketed toward the Kibbie Dome roof.\nBrantley\u2019s day was highlighted by intercepting a deep throw by sophomore quarterback Mason Petrino. He laid a forceful hit on Jante Boston after a catch near the goal line. He was a consistent tackler throughout the two-hour workout, and when senior quarterback Matt Linehan looked left, more often than not he found Brantley and cornerback Lloyd Hightower had locked down that side of the field.\nAs for Linehan completing a pass to Jacon Sannon, who dipped a shoulder and was able to freeze Brantley long enough to gain extra yardage, well, spring is for working out things like that.\nBrantley likes the view from the defensive backfield.\n\u201cI do. I\u2019m getting real comfortable with it. I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d As for the way he and Hightower have meshed so quickly, \u201cwe\u2019re communicating real well,\u201dBrantley said.\nSaunders\u2019 grin suggests Brantley on defense is still like seeing something as incongruous as a duck carrying a briefcase.\nThey had some good natured speculation about a future meeting this spring. Saunders might still have the advantage there. He ran hard the entire scrimmage, and his several touchdowns included a play where he looked inside, bounced out to the right and won a race to the corner to score.\nOnly one player was forced to leave with an injury.

{"idx": "33708", "prompt": "Continue the following text: When I told people that I was going to write a book on memory, I saw \"good luck with that\" written on a few faces. Memory is a massive topic. Any intelligent system needs some way of tracking where it is in time, and that means remembering where it has been. No surprise, then, that studying memory proliferates into numerous sub-disciplines. You can specialise in short-term memory (memory traces that persist for a few seconds) or cast your net into memories that stretch back through an entire human lifetime. An essential distinction is between memory for facts (semantic memory) and memory for events (episodic memory). I was interested in a branch of memory research that straddles the two: autobiographical memory, or the memory we have for the events of our own lives.\nRoughly four decades of research (with historical precedents that stretch back much further) tell us that this kind of memory is essentially reconstructive. A memory is stitched together in the present moment from several different kinds of information, in a process that's subject to the current beliefs and biases of the person doing the remembering. But surveys tell us that many people remain wedded to a view of memories as immutable, static possessions. Why do we get memory so wrong? One possible reason is that memories are precious to us: they define us in many ways, and so we react with discomfort to the idea that they are the constructions of a story-telling mind.\nAlthough few scientists would quibble with the idea of the reconstructive nature of memory, there have been some hot new developments: in understanding the social dimensions of remembering, particularly in the very young and very old; in working out how memory functions in trauma and extreme emotion; and in linking remembering the past to thinking about the future, to imagination and to creativity. Keeping up with the latest research meant that I stuck mainly to journal articles when writing Pieces of Light. But several books, although sometimes a little out of date, had profound influences on my thinking about memory's slippery charms.\nMemory has been a topic of fascination for centuries. For the long view on how humans have gone about studying it, this book by a Dutch historian of psychology is hard to beat. In poised, humorous prose, he ranges from the stories of respondents to an 1899 survey who had \"flashbulb\" memories of hearing of the death of Abraham Lincoln, to the diary study of psychologist Willem Wagenaar, who for six years wrote out a daily memory so that he could test his own forgetting, to the nineteenth-century French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau, who asked why the years speed by more quickly as we age.\nHarvard psychologist Schacter has been a leading figure in the cognitive neuroscience of episodic memory. In this, his first book, he provides a detailed and highly readable account of how memories are encoded, stored and retrieved, how remembering is damaged and preserved in amnesia, and how memories are distorted by trauma. Particularly interesting is his focus on how memory processes are depicted and interrogated by visual artists, although the pictures unfortunately don't reproduce too well in the paperback. While the field of memory has moved on a fair bit in the eighteen years since this was published, its erudition and scientific authority make it unmatched as an introduction to the study of autobiographical memory.\nMemory was a big thing when books had to be copied out by hand. Building on classical ideas, such as the \"method of loci\" attributed to Simonides (think of a place and fill it with striking images corresponding to the items you want to remember), our medieval ancestors turned remembering into a developed art.

There were tests upon tests. Blood tests, heart tests, mental tests. I had to be checked for diabetes. There were questions about my weight and whether I could handle the surgery. I had to lose 15 pounds. I got down to 214. It was the lightest I remember being as an adult, until my own cancer treatment a couple of years ago knocked me below that number.\nThe surgery was scheduled and there was one last test.\nI failed.

As Michael\u2019s mother, Sarah Loness, told Heffernan about her own son, she gave me life.\nI wish I could have returned the favor.\nEventually, kidney failure and years of dialysis led to heart failure. My mother was on donation lists for a while, carrying her trusty beeper everywhere, but eventually doctors told her she was too weak and she couldn\u2019t handle the needed heart-pancreas-kidney transplant surgery.

The findings were published in the April issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation.\nThe Spanish researchers focused on two patients suffering from \"recurrent glioblastoma multiforme,\" a fast-moving form of brain cancer. Both patients had been enrolled in a clinical trial designed to test THC's potential as a cancer therapy.\nUsing electron microscopes to analyze brain tissue taken both before and after a 26- to 30-day THC treatment regimen, the researchers found that THC eliminated cancer cells while it left healthy cells intact.\nThe team also was able, in what it described as a \"novel\" discovery, to track the signaling route by which this process was activated.\nThese findings were replicated in work with mice, which had been \"engineered\" to carry three different types of human cancer tumor grafts.\n\"These results may help to design new cancer therapies based on the use of medicines containing the active principle of marijuana and/or in the activation of autophagy,\" Velasco said.\nOutside experts suggested that more research is needed before advocating marijuana as a medicinal intervention for brain cancer.\nDr. John S. Yu, co-director of the Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program in the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said the findings were \"not surprising.\"\n\"There have been previous reports to this effect as well,\" he said. \"So this is yet another indication that THC has an anti-cancer effect, which means it's certainly worth further study. But it does not suggest that one should jump at marijuana for a potential cure for cancer, and one should not urge anyone to start smoking pot right away as a means of curing their own cancer.\"\nBut that's exactly what many brain cancer patients have been doing, said Dr. Paul Graham Fisher, the Beirne Family director of Neuro-Oncology at Stanford University.\n\"In fact, 40 percent of brain tumor patients in the U.S. are already using alternative treatments, ranging from herbals to vitamins to marijuana,\" he said. \"But that actually points out a cautionary tale here, which is that many brain cancer patients are already rolling a joint to treat themselves, but we're not really seeing brain tumors suddenly going away as a result, which we clearly would've noticed if it had that effect. So we need to be open-minded. But this suggests that the promise of THC might be a little over-hoped, and certainly requires further investigation before telling people to go out and roll a joint.\"\nFor additional details on the risks and benefits of marijuana use as it relates to cancer, visit the American Cancer Society."}

{"idx": "33720", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Teams work better with clear, shared, attainable goals.\nThe acronym SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. Using SMART in advertising creates a clear-cut path to preset goals. With a defined timeline to achieve the SMART standards, businesses are able to plan their future by examining the past. Through planning and organization, you can define the elements of SMART in an advertising arena.\nSpecific advertising goals come in several packages. They can be defined by specific dollar goals, client goals or campaign goals. An example of a specific dollar goal would be a plan to achieve a 10 percent ad revenue increase within the next 12 months. This translates to advertising representatives committing to pump up their game until they are selling 10 percent more ads than they currently sell. Specific client goals might be to sign one new client a week for the next few weeks. Campaign goals might be to complete the pitch presentation for the new client's first campaign.\nThe developed goals must be measurable by a pre-agreed-upon standard. For example, if the goal is to increase advertising sales by 10 percent in the next year, that would mean that each month the company should see a 0.833 percent increase.\nIt is important to keep goals attainable so that you will have a realistic ability to plan for the company's future. To calculate how much of a revenue increase you are expecting over the next 12 months, factor in the current economy, past account representative performance, plans for increased productivity and any changes being made, such as opening a new market in which to sell. Choosing attainable goals gives you the measurable standard of results. Your company must achieve each SMART goal with the right tools and effort. Breaking the projects into smaller chunks of attainable steps is a good way to move toward attaining the larger goal.\nYour goals must be realistic. If you are a small business with a limited budget, a goal to be the largest advertising agency in Houston within six months is not realistic, nor likely to happen. Instead, set goals that are possible and then move toward bigger goals. One example of a realistic goal in advertising might be to develop an advertising campaign for the Houston Astros before the year is out.\nTimeliness moves your company forward. If the goals have short time frames for achievement, you are able to move on to the next level. Timeliness in advertising is almost a given because of deadlines. Larger goals, such as trying to pitch a campaign to the Houston Symphony, should have a timeline as well. For example, you would need to pitch a campaign focused on next year's booked performances a year in advance. Setting timely goals helps keep everyone moving forward to accomplish those goals.\n, Candace. \"Examples of SMART Goals for Advertising.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-smart-goals-advertising-10702.html.

He was replaced on Team Canada's roster by Clinton, Ont. native Ryan O'Reilly.\n\"It's never easy to lose a player to injury, let alone one of Tyler's calibre, but once again, it speaks to the depth of talent in the country to be able to add a Ryan O'Reilly to our team,\" Doug Armstrong, Team Canada's general manager, said in a statement.\nIt's thought that Seguin might have been injured when he tumbled feet-first into the end boards during Canada's exhibition opener against the United States on Friday. Seguin briefly left that game before returning to action. He suited up again a night later and participated in practice on Tuesday morning, but was evidently not well enough to continue.\n\"While I'm upset that I don't get the opportunity to play, I understand the situation Team Canada is in with a short tournament,\" Seguin said in a statement released by the Stars. \"I wish all the best for that team and the good news is that I'll get to be with my Stars teammates from day one.\"\nInjuries have stung Seguin at inopportune times recently. He missed all but one game of the 2016 NHL post-season, primarily because of an Achilles injury. His Dallas teammate, Jamie Benn, was also forced to pull out of the World Cup because of injury (core muscle surgery), and was replaced by San Jose Sharks forward Logan Couture prior to training camp.\nO'Reilly is coming off a solid season for the Buffalo Sabres. An effective centre at both ends of the ice, he posted 21 goals and 60 points in only 71 games for the Sabres last year, while winning 57 per cent of his draws. He's also been a regular contributor for Canada at the world championships, mustering eight points in his fourth tournament this past spring.\nHe doesn't make up for Seguin's offensive ability though. The Brampton, Ont. native has rung up at least 33 goals for the Stars in each of the past three seasons and offered Canada one more game-breaking element.\nThe Canadians are rich with offensive weaponry regardless. O'Reilly is one of only two forwards on the roster (Claude Giroux) yet to post 30 goals in a season, though he came close with 28 markers during the 2013-14 season.\nIn addition to Seguin and Benn, the Canadians have also lost Duncan Keith and Jeff Carter to injury.\nTeam Canada concludes its exhibition schedule against Russia in Pittsburgh on Wednesday night before beginning tournament play against the Czech Republic on Saturday."}

As reported in the journal Nature, they used CRISPR-cas9. On one hand, their success represents an exciting breakthrough and on the other, it\u2019s a stark reminder of all we don\u2019t yet understand about human genetics. That\u2019s because the repair of the gene occurred in a way that researchers didn\u2019t anticipate.\nThe gene they repaired is MYBPC3. A mutation in it causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). With HCM, which is estimated to occur in 700,000 to 725,000 U.S. citizens \u2014 1 in 500's heart muscle becomes thickened. Many people lead normal lives with it, with or without treatment. HCM isn\u2019t restricted to any particular group or gender, either, but the disease is especially worrisome in young people, where its first symptom can be sudden death \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the most common cause of death in young athletes.\nWord of the repair first appeared in i News, followed a week later by the peer-reviewed study in Nature. An international team authored the study, with scientists from Oregon, California, China, and South Korea. They were led by senior author Shoukhrat Mitalipov, director of the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU).\nMitalipov previously made a name for himself by introducing the first cloned stem cells from monkeys, the first \u201cthree-parent\u201d monkeys, and making embryonic cells from human skin cells.\nThe new study involved embryos created with eggs from 12 healthy females injected with sperm from a male with the MYBPC3 mutation. The team tried twice, using a cas9 enzyme targeting the mutation they sought to snip out. The cas9 enzyme was accompanied by a synthetic DNA template modeled after a normal MYBPC3 gene, but chemically tagged so it could be identified by researchers later.\nIn the first experiments, the scientists fertilized 54 eggs with the sperm, and then injected the cas9 enzyme and template post-fertilization.\nIf you carry the MYBPC3 mutation, there\u2019s a 50% chance your children will develop HCM. It only takes one parent having the mutation for offspring to acquire the condition.\nIn the second round, the scientists injected the sperm, cas9, and the DNA template together, and the the result was a pronounced increase in their success rate. In 42 of the 58 embryos, 72.4%, the mutation was successfully snipped out and replaced by cells without the MYBPC3 mutation. And \u2014 most encouragingly \u2014 no mosaic embryos were produced.\nIt also allows Mitalipov to hedge a bit as to just exactly what he and his team have done. \u201cEveryone always talks about gene editing,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018editing.\u2019 We didn\u2019t edit or modify anything. All we did was unmodify a mutant gene using the existing wild-type maternal gene.\u201d In other words, we didn\u2019t implant synthetic DNA in anyone.

{"idx": "33724", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to protect the voting rights of mostly black voters in mostly Southern states. It mandated, among other things, that jurisdictions covered by the law have new voting laws reviewed by the government to assure that they weren\u2019t discriminatory.\nThat provision was tossed by the Supreme Court in 2013. A Texas voter ID law that had been rejected by the Department of Justice prior to the court\u2019s decision was reintroduced immediately afterward \u2014 and was quickly found to be discriminatory.\nDuring his confirmation hearing last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was asked about the Voting Rights Act.\n\u201cIt is intrusive. The Supreme Court on more than one occasion has described it legally as an intrusive act, because you\u2019re only focused on a certain number of states,\u201d the then-Alabama senator said in January 2017.\nThat history is newly relevant because of the rationale offered by the Department of Justice in requesting that the Census Bureau add a question regarding citizenship to the 2020 survey. The Justice Department says the question is necessary because it requires specific data to identify violations of the Voting Rights Act.\n\u201c[H]aving these data at the census block level\u201d \u2014 the most fine-grained unit at which the census gathers data \u2014 \u201cwill permit more effective enforcement of the Act,\u201d wrote Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in his letter to undersecretary Karen Dunn Kelley responding to Justice\u2019s request. \u201cSection 2 protects minority population voting rights.\u201d Ross\u2019s letter goes on to explain that the Census Bureau will honor Justice\u2019s request and include a question about citizenship.\nBut the reason that the question is controversial is not Sessions\u2019s background on the Voting Rights Act. It\u2019s controversial because experts argue that the effect of the question will be to dampen participation in the census by those who immigrated to the country illegally.\nThe decennial census is intended to count the number of people living in the United States (regardless of immigration status or citizenship) and then to use that data to inform key decisions like government spending and allocation of House seats and electoral votes. If undocumented immigrants are less likely to respond to the census, the population figures in places that they live will be significantly lower than they might otherwise be.\nPew Research estimated where those immigrants lived in a report released in February 2017. Of the 11 million or so immigrants living in the country without legal status, most live in cities.\nIt\u2019s those cities that would see the most dramatic undercounts in the survey.\nThey already see undercounts. In the 2010 Census, the bureau estimated a 1.5 percent undercount of Hispanics and a 2.1 percent undercount among black Americans. The concern is that the first figure in particular would rise substantially if a citizenship question were added.\nIn his letter, Ross writes that he has seen little evidence that it would.\nThe Census Bureau asked about citizenship in all interviews in 1950. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of nonwhite residents identified in California, Iowa and Texas didn\u2019t increase dramatically \u2014 but the varying definitions of racial and ethnic groups over that period make it tricky to assess any effect.\nThere are many other caveats worth mentioning.\nThe GAO advocated using a system that offered respondents one of two cards and asked people to identify the group to which they belonged. By comparing responses from the two groups, the number of undocumented immigrants could be estimated.\nThat\u2019s particularly pertinent now that the administration of President Trump has been unsparing in target"}

{"idx": "33727", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: --If the Dodgers fail to sign Ramirez to a long-term contract, then they will likely receive two draft picks as compensation for losing him, assuming he's offered arbitration. If the team that signs Manny Ramirez drafts outside the top-15, then they receive that team's pick, and a supplemental pick between the first and second round. If that team drafts in the top-15, then the Dodgers receive their second round pick and still keeps the supplemental pick. I hope that's clear.\n--The Dodgers took advantage of the Red Sox apparent desperation to get rid of Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox have been desperate to get rid of his act before, exposing him to waivers in 2004, nearly trading him for A-Rod at one point, nearly sending him to the Mets at another point, and he's been dangled many times before. But they always held onto him, and he helped Boston win two World Series. This time however, Manny's antics were too much to bear for the Red Sox, and they were insistent on getting rid of him, that they gave up two decent prospects and agreed to pay his salary. In order to succeed in baseball, organizations must be opportunistic. The Dodgers took advantage of a unique opportunity in this case.\n--As Kevin Roderick points out, there has been some serious concern about the \"baggage\" that Ramirez brings to LA. I haven't been in the Red Sox clubhouse, so I have no idea how much of a problem he's really been. Evidently, he was problematic enough that the Red Sox upped the ante to trade him. But I'm not as pessimistic about Ramirez being an organizational cancer as some others.\nThe fact is, Manny is now a certain free agent after this season. He reportedly wants a 4-year $100 million contract. I find it hard to believe anyone will pay that much for his services through his 40th birthday. But if Manny really wants to have any chance at that salary, then he has to perform at his best in the next 2 months. I think he recognizes that. I also believe that Ramirez will be motivated to prove the Red Sox nation wrong, and a motivated Manny is an effective Manny.\nSince he'll only be here for two months, I'd be shocked if his act will wear thin. He already has the \"Manny being Manny\" mantra, and teammates will likely expect the bizarre from him and possibly embrace it.\n--It's true that Ramirez weakens the Dodgers defenisvely. In fact, the Dodgers may have one of the worst defensive teams in baseball on days in which Jeff Kent, Nomar Garciaparra, Juan Pierre, Casey Blake, and Ramirez are all in the lineup. The presence of Ramirez in the outfield practically mandates that Kemp and Ethier start, just to mitigate that effect. I don't believe that Blake's as bad defensively as some have suggested, but his range isn't great, and it's compounded if Nomar is playing shortstop.\nAt the end of the day though, I agree with TJ Simers' and Keith Law's takes as the trade was a no-brainer for LA because of what was involved, and that it will make the Dodgers the favorites in the West."}

But newer companies, including Groupon, are using Zendesk as their strategic help-desk platform, he said.\nSome of Zendesk's customers have \"floors full of support people\" answering customer queries, he said. \"If we could save them even a couple seconds on each ticket, over time and millions of tickets, it can add up.\"\nZendesk is now a \"single-page\" application, with an activity stream on the sidebar giving agents a view of updates to open tickets. Their main view shows tickets requiring their attention, and places the most important ones higher up. Once a ticket is resolved, the next most important one is automatically pushed to the agent.\nIf an agent is working on multiple tickets at once, they can be organized in tabs like a web browser would hold a series of pages, rather than spawning a potentially confusing array of new windows, Peterson said.\nZendesk has also catered to the wishes of power users: The new interface is accessible via keyboard shortcuts, with no need to touch a mouse, if desired. \"For our power users, this saves a lot of time and effort,\" Peterson said.\nOther new features include a new framework, Zendesk Apps, that allows Zendesk users to integrate third-party applications. Zendesk has also improved the application's content search function and now offers localization in \"more than 11 languages,\" according to a statement.\nThe new interface comes at no additional charge to subscribers.\nIt's also optional, and Zendesk plans to continue supporting the earlier version \"for the foreseeable future, and probably for a very long time,\" Peterson said. This will allow customers to ease into the transition, perhaps by having a handful of agents work with the new version first, he added. Zendesk is also planning to hold free weekly training sessions and has \"very rich documentation\" for the update.\n\"We're not going to rush people,\" Peterson said.\nAlso Wednesday, Zendesk said it had raised US$60 million in new venture financing, as it reportedly prepares to file for an IPO."}

{"idx": "33738", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: On the Facebook memorial page for Ana Marquez-Greene, one of the young victims of the Newtown, Conn., shooting, her parents posted a picture of her and her older brother on the first day of school last year. The realities of Newtown and its potential to be repeated became apparent in Atlanta two weeks ago when a lone gunman entered a school with a bag full of guns and 500 rounds of ammunition, prepared to massacre a group of elementary school children.\nToday marks the start of a new school year. As I reflect on a long and discouraging summer in progressive politics -- capped off by another national non-commemoration of Labor Day, even as service workers strike all over the country -- I am reminded of the kinds of volatile physical and intellectual conditions that shape public school systems in urban areas throughout the country.\nIn Atlanta, school clerk Antoinette Tuff found herself face-to-face with the gunman, 20-year old Michael Hill who came dangerously close to re-creating Newtown in a Southern, urban, predominantly black setting. For nearly an hour, Tuff used her Christian faith to create a context of radical empathy with the mentally ill Hill, who confessed that he had not taken his meds. Tuff convinced Hill to lay down his weapons and surrender to police, but not before he exchanged a round of gunfire with them. Her act of heroism points to the mostly invisible but incredibly impactful labor that school service personnel perform for students on a daily basis.\nStill, her heroism is no substitute for a comprehensive gun control policy in this country. The Tuff-Hill encounter came on the heels of Atlanta Public Schools opting to spend $10.1 million to hire and train 73 armed school resource officers. The first wave of \u201cresource\u201d officers began this year. Such solutions are problematic because they cast the students as a threat, rather than dealing with the broader culture of guns that embolden people like Michael Hill and Adam Lanza.\nBy contrast, in Philadelphia, school officials have laid off nearly 4,000 teachers, staff, counselors and classroom aides, in addition to closing 23 public schools. Although they could not find $304 million to close the budget shortfall, city officials were able to find $400 million to build a new prison. Chicago students also started school with more than 50 school closings.\nIn Louisiana, the federal government filed suit against the state for issuing school vouchers to subsidize students attending segregated private schools in districts that fall under federal desegregation statutes. Gov. Bobby Jindal has been incensed at the federal resistance to using public funds to subsidize racially segregated education.\nIn higher education, states continue to slash the budgets for public colleges and universities in places like Alabama, California and New Jersey, while passing that cost along to young college students, who will be saddled with huge amounts of student loan debt upon graduation. Though I have the fortune of working in a university with a strong union that advocates for all faculty, whether tenure track or not, many of my colleagues at other institutions do not have access to unions. Universities are increasingly relying on adjunct and non-tenure track labor to staff ever-expanding college classrooms. It is nearly impossible to make a living as a full-time adjunct professor, when you are frequently only paid between $3,000 and $5,000 per course, per semester. Moreover, transient adjunct labor creates challenges for departments and programs, particularly in progressive and interdisciplinary fields, like ethnic studies and gender studies.\nThe defund"}

{"idx": "33743", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: By Julie Wittes Schlack . Published on May 23, 2017.\nOur biases are expressed in the very data we collect, infecting its analysis as well, writes Julie Wittes Schlack.\nIn the past year or so, I've been struck by how we tend to anthropomorphize the machines and mechanize the human beings whose data we rely on. The machines are \"ingesting,\" \"consuming,\" and \"learning,\" while people's life stories, videos and loved-ones photos --the meaningful moments of their lives -- are flattened into consumable \"documents\" or \"transactions.\"\nThis observation is not an excuse to rant against artificial intelligence. On the contrary, the more I work with machine learning, the more appreciative I am of its accuracy and productivity benefits. Rather, it is a call to recognize why human intelligence and compassion are, and will remain, a necessary companion to AI.\nWhy? Because AI falsely seduces us into believing that the software's conclusions are somehow \"objective,\" free of the bias that inevitably informs purely human-based methods of interpretation.\nWe bring our biases -- our tendency to interpret comments through the filter of our own beliefs -- to the training task itself. For example, we try to make our automated systems smarter when we interpret the nuance in even a simple phrase like \"Love it!\" to determine whether the sentiment is sarcastic or sincere. If I'm the person assembling the training set and correcting the system's errors, I'm likely to perpetuate my own conviction that people who use that phrase in relation to the flavor of Cheez-Whiz or the music of Abba can't possibly be sincere. But my Euro-pop-loving colleague might teach the machine the opposite lesson.\nWhat's more, our biases are expressed in the very data we collect, because often the context in which the data was collected is crucial to its proper interpretation. For instance, a generally smart concept-extraction tool we've been using at C Space told us that members of several financial services communities were having an inordinately high volume of conversation about music. Why? Because they were discussing \"records\" and \"CDs\" \u2026 but not the kind made by John Legend.\nIn another case, we've been making the machine smarter by training it to recognize that \"pumpkin\" is relevant to Halloween, but those training sets are useful only if we're feeding it training data that was harvested in October. Pumpkin content mined in spring is more likely to be about gardening, while mentions during Restaurant Week are more likely to be enticements to sample Middle Eastern cuisine.\nWhile most of our work with machine learning focuses on text analytics and image recognition, the bias inherent in a data set influences a wide range of algorithms applied to all kinds of data. For instance, when Pokeman Go was first released, users quickly discovered a paucity of Pokeman locations in black neighborhoods. That's because its initial database of locations was based on a prior augmented reality game whose locations were based on the activities and requests of its predominantly white, English-speaking male user base -- a population less likely to frequent those neighborhoods.\nThis is just one of many examples of how machine learning is inevitably based on what is, not on what could be; on established patterns rather than possibility. So as useful as it is, by relying exclusively or even predominantly on machine learning, we risk constraining our ability to innovate. Data indicates what people do within the realm of what's available and observable, but it has neither conscience nor imagination. If, in the early 1960"}

{"idx": "33745", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In my colleague Ben Casselman\u2019s article this week on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s side-eyed guidance for all of the people rushing to prepay property taxes, he quoted some words of warning from Andy Grewal, a professor of tax law at the University of Iowa.\nMr. Grewal said homeowners who usually paid their property taxes through an escrow account via their mortgage servicer could end up facing an audit if they prepaid at their local assessor\u2019s office this time. That\u2019s because the tax payments the individuals report to the I.R.S. on their tax forms could differ from what the banks would report on the separate forms they use when reporting mortgage activity to the government. Differing figures raise questions at the I.R.S.\nThat got me wondering: Couldn\u2019t you just call your bank and ask it to update the figure it puts on its own forms? It turns out the answer may be no, but this issue is not simple or consistent among banks, either.\nMr. Grewal was right to worry about this issue, given the number of people with escrow accounts. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, 79 percent of borrowers had escrow accounts in 2016 from which they paid property taxes on their primary mortgage.\nBut not all banks report property tax payments on the form they generate, Form 1098. Wells Fargo and Quicken Loans say they do report property tax payments on the form. And no, alas, you cannot call them up and ask them to add whatever you are paying on your own to what was already sent from the escrow account this year. They will not adjust the figure.\nApparently, though, there is no legal requirement for a bank to report property taxes paid from an escrow account at all. Bank of America and Chase do not report it. Bank of America was fulfilling requests for additional property tax payments from people who already had property tax bills in hand, but it stopped doing so on Tuesday.\nAlso, here\u2019s an alert for a possible future headache: If you do prepay and have a mortgage and an escrow account, it may be a hassle (or impossible) to get the bank to adjust the original 2018 property tax payment schedule that it set on your behalf. You will want to let the bank know what you did and ask it to make whatever adjustments it can.\nSo people who want to prepay before Sunday but avoid trouble with the I.R.S. are faced with an interesting set of questions. If you\u2019re sure that your jurisdiction has officially assessed taxes that you can prepay and deduct this year, but you have a mortgage with Wells Fargo or Quicken Loans, you will probably have no problem if the I.R.S. hassles you about differing amounts on different forms. But would the agency also then help itself to a look at other parts of your tax return?

Blisters can force you to restrict your activity and limit physical training. In some cases, friction blisters develop into infections that require antibiotics and medical treatment. As one of the most common injuries among active duty military, friction blisters can have a notable adverse impact to military readiness.\nActivities such as marching and running are the most common causes of blisters in the military. A recent review of injuries associated with marching or hiking showed that heavy load carriage increases your risk of foot blisters. You may not be able to avoid activities that put you at risk of developing blisters. However, there are things you can do to minimize the likelihood of developing a blister and/or reduce the severity of any blisters you develop.\nYou may already be aware that some individuals are more prone to develop blisters than others who perform the same activities. While the science is not substantial, studies do provide evidence that some people may have a higher risk of developing blisters. For example, having no foot arch or flat feet, or being of an ethnicity other than African American/Black, can increase your risk of getting a blister. While these factors cannot be changed, other factors that increase risk of blister can be modified. For instance, wearing cotton socks, especially if socks or feet are moist, and using tobacco (including smokeless tobacco) can increase chances you develop blisters.\nIn addition, various \"best practices\" for preventing blisters are also recommended by medical professionals and professional and amateur athletes. While there is limited scientific evidence validating the effectiveness of most tactics among large populations, try some of the tactics below to determine what works best for you in avoiding the pesky but painful blister!\n\u2022 Increase duration and intensity of blister-causing activities slowly over time.\n\u2022 Use the same shoes, gloves or load weight/shape as you increase activity.\n\u2022 Synthetic socks made from acrylic, nylon or polyester that ventilate and wick moisture away from the feet are recommended over cotton socks, to prevent blisters, especially during long distance marching or running.\n\u2022 Some people advocate wearing a double layer of socks (non-cotton), since a second layer stops the first from rubbing against the skin. However, others prefer a single layer loop-stitched sock, as less heat is generated than with 2 layers. Scientific evidence does not clearly indicate which is best -- this may vary with individual risk factors.\n\u2022 Make sure toes do not touch end of shoe while walking, and consider a wide toe box with room for toes to wiggle.\n\u2022 Purchase shoes later in the day since foot size may swell half a size throughout the day or after activity.\n\u2022 Do not leave shoes/boots on radiators or near heaters since this can cause them to shrink and seams to protrude.\n\u2022 Certain skin coverings have been shown to help absorb friction during movement which can reduce blister occurrence or severity.\n\u2022 Zinc Oxide tape has been anecdotally reported in running communities to prevent blisters from forming or minimizing further injury to an existing blister. Other products referred to as \"blister plasters\" will expand in response to friction and thus protect the area from blisters forming or getting worse.\n\u2022 A closed-cell neoprene insole was found to reduce the incidence of blisters in U.S. Coast Guard recruits.\n\u2022 Anecdotal"}

While the electorate seeks clarity on key issues that matter to it, many voters have been bombarded with empty speculation, fluctuating polls and arcane details about politicians\u2019 lives.\nLittle has been spoken about the elephant in the room: the democratic crater at the heart of British politics that is dismantling the welfare state.\nAnalysis of the most divisive general election topics has been muted at best, while coverage of many defining issues has been virtually obsolete.\nLabour,the Conservatives, theLiberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) may appear to clash over ideological divergences. But there was an unspoken consensus throughout the campaign race about which topics were worthy of debate.\nThe gaps in these general election narratives tell us more about Britain's democratic deficit than empty election pledges or City fear-mongering ever could. It is this black hole in the heart of British democracy that continues to compound inequality, undercut Britain\u2019s economic recovery, increase poverty and erode the remaining fragments of Britain\u2019s welfare state.\nThe first and perhaps most glaring omission from recent general election coverage is the fractured and corroded system under which Britons are expected to vote. Criticism of a tainted political funding system that allows gilded tycoons and firms to buy a system tailored to their interests has been sorely lacking.\nAnd as polling day draws closer, calls for fiscal and financial reform are framed as dangerous populism, while corruption remains rife in the City, inequality continues to soar and Britain\u2019s social fabric continues to collapse under the weight of ill-conceived public-private partnerships.\nAs policy continues to operate in the interests of big business, little is spoken of the slow-burning social cleansing that rages through London\u2019s pro-business pastures leaving single mothers and their children homeless in its wake.\nFollowing a financial crisis that threatened to derail the nation's economy, mainstream parties\u2019 rhetoric continues to gravitate between pro-business and business-as-usual politics. Some six years after the crash, impunity lingers in the face of widespread white collar crime and regulatory raps on the wrist continue to replace criminal prosecutions.\nThe City of London, the governance of which is enshrined in a medieval Magna Carta harking back to an era of serfdom, remains as unaccountable as ever. And then there\u2019s a regressive tax system that continues to benefit the nation\u2019s most wealthy individuals as Victorian-style poverty and inequality rage on.\nWhile income tax levels in Britain are undoubtedly progressive, many dimensions of the UK\u2019s tax system are not. The reality is that UK financial regulation is hardwired to aid wealthy tycoons in paying as little tax as possible.\nThe richest 10 percent pay 35 percent of the country\u2019s tax take, yet the poorest 10 percent of Britons pay 43 percent. Critics warn this unjust situation plays out primarily because of regressive forms of taxation such as council tax and VAT.\nAn estimated 96 percent of Britons say they would like to see a more progressive taxation system. Yet such a system is yet to emerge, and Britain\u2019s main political parties have failed to promise its arrival anytime soon.\nWhile Labour and the Greens highlighted the need for fairer taxation throughout the campaign race, neither party went far enough in laying bare the regressive nature of the status quo.\nThe mainstream contenders have also failed to adequately tax land and property.

Or is it?\nThe dollar has sunk like a stone in recent weeks. With the euro now at $1.41, nobody's seriously talking about parity any more. There are growing concerns about the trade deficit in the United States and the possibility of trade and currency wars -- particularly with China.\nAnd with the Federal Reserve strongly hinting that a new round of bond buying -- the so-called quantitative easing policy -- is likely to be announced at its next meeting in early November, long-term bond yields could continue to sink.\nThat may put pressure on the dollar and make our nation's biggest creditors, i.e. China and Japan, increasingly wary of holding debt that offers such little in the way of return.\nSo is it time to worry yet about the anemic dollar? Investors in stocks are strongly saying no. As the chart at the top of this column shows, the market has tended to move higher even as the dollar weakens against a basket of major currencies, which includes the euro and the yen.\nThe bet is that the weak dollar is good news for big multinational firms like IBM (IBM, Fortune 500), Coca-Cola (KO, Fortune 500) and McDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500). It should lead to increased demand for U.S.-made goods and services abroad -- particularly in hot emerging markets like China and India.\nBut how long can that last?\nSeveral experts said the dollar does have some room to fall further before it becomes a problem. But not that much room.\n\"We're not in a danger zone yet. However, the dollar is rapidly depreciating so the time to worry could come up more quickly than people realize,\" said Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist with BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.\nBusch said something has to give soon though. If bond yields continue to fall and the price of gold keeps hitting new record highs, then that's troubling for the dollar.\nFred Fraenkel, vice chairman with Beacon Trust Company, an investment firm in Summit, N.J., agreed that the time may be coming where the sluggish greenback does more harm than good for the economy and markets.\n\"Right now, the positive impact the weak dollar has had on exports and multinational earnings has so far overwhelmed the impact of people in the financial world looking for a different place to invest their reserves,\" he said.\n\"But when you degrade your currency over a long enough period of time, it's a negative for your standing in the world and reserve currency status. That's the big problem that can eventually come back to haunt you,\" Fraenkel added.\nDegrade is a strong word. It implies that there is a conscious effort to make the dollar weak. And in some respects, that is what's happening.\nThe Fed is clearly making the decision that it's willing to let the dollar fall a bit more because it thinks a new round of QE could help get the economy back on firmer footing in the short term.\nThe big concern though is that the Fed may be going too far. If the dollar gets so weak that the likes of China and Japan pull out of the U.S. debt market and other nations find that"}

{"idx": "33766", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Wednesday\u2019s announcement goes one step further by incentivizing sugar mills to divert all their sugar cane juice away from sugar to ethanol. So, ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses will continue to earn \u20b943.70 per litre.\nThe government on Wednesday approved an increase in ethanol prices for the 2018-19 sugar season, starting October. The level of the price increase suggests that the centre wants to incentivize ethanol output and investments in capacity addition. But the industry may still be wary, given that these incentives were to paper over the structural cracks in the sugar industry, which may raise the risk of a volatile future.\nFirst, a quick recap of the sugar situation. Farmers want sugar cane prices to increase, even when sugar prices fall. The central government supports this desire with a minimum price that never declines. Sugar mills don\u2019t pay farmers when they are making losses. The government offers sops to the mills to clear arrears. But the government will also not let sugar prices increase because voters have a sweet tooth.\nThe current season has seen a surge in output. The new season, beginning October, is also expected to see a bumper crop. That has created a problem of plenty, and unpaid cane arrears.\nOne solution is to divert cane to produce ethanol. The government has asked the industry to invest in ethanol capacity, assuring them of offtake, giving incentives and setting remunerative prices to be paid by oil marketing companies.\nWednesday\u2019s announcement goes one step further by incentivizing sugar mills to divert all their sugar cane juice away from sugar to ethanol. So, ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses will continue to earn \u20b9 43.70 per litre.\nIn the case of B-heavy molasses, the price has been increased by 11.3% to \u20b9 52.40 per litre. Compared to C-heavy, the sugar output is lower by 20%, while ethanol output doubles. For ethanol produced directly from sugar cane juice, the procurement price has been revised by 25% to \u20b9 59.10 a litre. Here, while sugar output is nil, ethanol output rises six-fold, according to the government statement.\nThe price difference for 100% juice to ethanol is because this process produces only ethanol, instead of a mix of sugar and ethanol in the B and C categories.\nThis is a big step for the government, because it allows sugar mills to produce only ethanol. But mills will have to invest in distillery capacity and will also require investments in pollution control, storage and logistics, according to the management of Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, in their post-results conference call. The company itself is investing \u20b9 207 crore in a new distillery.\nThere is nothing wrong in giving incentives to a particular industry. In fact, ethanol blending also lowers the fuel import bill. But this is a problem largely of the government\u2019s own creation. If it had allowed cane prices to rise and fall, the crop would do likewise and the market would balance itself. Incentivizing ethanol is an imperfect fix.\nWhen fuel prices decline, oil companies will want to pay lower for ethanol. Falling fuel prices was one reason why ethanol producers in Brazil suffered.\nIf ethanol prices decline, sugar mills will find their margins"}

One suspects that this is going to be the case with Apple Pay. That it is going to revolutionize the payment industry and make us all reliant on our smart devices to be our digital wallets.\nYou might wish to ask Bill Gates (News - Alert) about how that vision he had back in 1993 of a digital wallet worked out for Microsoft. Or before you get caught up in the frenzy, it is good to note that Sony and Philips (News - Alert) laid the groundwork for Near Field Communications (NFC) in 2002 and despite the functionality being in most new smart devices, it has yet to live up to its promise. Yes, tablets had been around for a while before the iPad help define the category and the same can be said for the iPhone (News - Alert) helping kick start the smartphone era. However, it really did take time for those markets to reach a tipping point before mass adoption kicked in.\nThe reason to be somewhat circumspect about the pace of smartphones replacing plastic of all kinds for the majority of transactions is precisely because despite the hype surround Apple Pay old habits do die hard. Hence, it remains to be seen if Apple Pay really is the capability that ignites the digital wallet fire. Indeed, indications that this revolution could very well progress in evolutionary steps abounds on the technology as well as business model fronts.\nOne company, with its own innovative approach to mobile payments is Ann Arbor, MI-based Stratos Inc. The company\u2019s Bluetooth Connected Card\u2122 Platform combines plastic cards into a single, smart, dynamic card.

Users have the convenience of a single card in a familiar form factor while merchants have means for speeding transactions without a major infrastructure upgrade.\nStratos (News - Alert) wanted a better understanding of consumer attitudes about mobile transactions and commissioned its Stratos Holiday Mobile Payment Survey. This survey was conducted online within the United States by research firm AYTM - Ask Your Target (News - Alert) Market among 400 smartphone owners ages 24 - 50 on November 11, 2014. The data reported has a 95 percent confidence level with a margin of error of + or - 4.9 percent. The highlights, to be released in their entirely December 16, are food for thought.\nMobile payment solutions/wars have already emerged on most research firms\u2019 lists of top trends for 2015. That prediction seems to be rather obvious. What is less obvious is what platform consumers ultimately prefer. Will it be Apple Pay, NFC solutions, all-in-one cards, wearables, all of the aforementioned or none of them? Time obviously will tell, but how long we have to wait for time to really tell is the hard part to predict.

Instead, we thought we would take a minute to reflect on the people who will be critical to game's proceedings, and we can safely predict will be blamed, no matter who wins the title. We're talking about the referees.\nWe were wondering what it takes to referee a World Cup final, so we reached out to English former professional football referee Howard Webb. He refereed the 2010 World Cup final between the Netherlands and Spain. That same year, he also officiated the UEFA Championships \u2013 becoming the first referee to accomplish this feat.\nHoward Webb, general manager of the Professional Referee Organization, talks during an interview, Wednesday, May 16, 2018, in New York. The former Premier League referee worked at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, including 2010 World Cup final.\nAfter more than a decade as Premier League referee and officiating for FIFA from 2005 to 2014, Webb is now general manager for the Professional Referee Organization, which manages leagues in the United States and Canada. He spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about his experience on the field in one of the world's most exciting sports and his thoughts on this year's competition.\nIt was the hardest two hours, I was sure. Yeah, it was among the most difficult games of all time and for that to happen in the final when maybe a billion people are watching kind of puts you in a difficult spot as the referee, and you know, you get to do a job you have to apply the laws of the game fearlessly and fairly. But equally, you know you don't want to overreact, you don't want to spoil the game. You don't want to react to it and create more difficulties and it's a tricky balance to strike and it ended up with me showing 14 yellow cards in the game, which is more than any other game \u2014 I refereed over 500 professional games. But yeah, that was the hardest and that number of cards would certainly reflect that.\nThose two points are connected quite heavily; one in terms of your police training and the other about language. ... You don't have a truncheon that you can use on the field but you learn to use really strong body language. As a police officer, you learn to stay calm.

She tweeted on Sunday that the DHS doesn't \"have a policy of separating families at the border.

BBC, fair use.\nMichael Fallon richly deserved to fall into the trap that Krishnan Guru-Murthy recently sprang on him, which saw him pouring scorn on words previously spoken by foreign secretary Boris Johnson. His spluttering insistence that we not seek to understand the motives of killers such as Salman Abedi represents politics at its most grating \u2013 as a brazen insult to the intelligence of the public.\nBut behind the attacks faced by Jeremy Corbyn from both right and centre regarding his comments about the failure of the war on terror lies a serious and genuine debate. Can we really say, more than a decade after the Iraq War, that our foreign engagements are a major cause of jihadist terrorism at home?\nIn a recent column in the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland pours scorn on what he admits is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018carefully caveated\u2019 position.

One big change is support for running trained machine learning models as part of Windows applications, taking advantage of local GPUs to accelerate machine learning applications.\nBuilding a machine learning application can be a complex process. Training a model can require a lot of data, and a considerable amount of processing power. That\u2019s fine if you\u2019ve got access to a cloud platform and lots of bandwidth, but what if you want to take an existing model from GitHub and run it on a PC?\nTrained machine learning models are an ideal tool for bringing the benefits of neural networks and deep learning to your applications. All you should need to do is hook up the appropriate interfaces, and they should run as part of your code. But with many machine learning frameworks and platforms, there\u2019s a need for a common runtime that can use any of the models out there. That\u2019s where the new Windows machine learning tools comes into play, offering Windows developers a platform to run existing machine learning models in their applications, taking advantage of a developing open standard for exchanging machine learning models.\nMicrosoft is supporting ONNX, the Open Neural Network Exchange format, an open standard for sharing deep learning models between platforms and services. With ONNX you can build and train neural networks on cloud platforms or on dedicated machine learning systems, using well-known algorithms. Once trained, the algorithms can run on another framework, or with Windows machine learning as part of an application on a PC, or even an IoT device.\nONNX currently supports a range of machine learning frameworks, including Facebook\u2019s popular Caffe 2, the Python-based PyTorch, and Microsoft\u2019s own Cognitive Toolkit (formerly named CNTK). While there\u2019s not direct support for Google\u2019s TensorFlow, you can find unofficial connectors that let you export as ONNX, with an official import/export tool currently under development. ONNX offers its own runtimes and libraries, so your models can run on your hardware and take advantage of any accelerators you have.\nIf you\u2019re using Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit on Azure to build and run machine learning models, you should already have access to ONNX, because it\u2019s built into every version after 2.3.1, and it\u2019ll soon be part of the Visual Studio Tools for AI. All you need to do to export a model is to choose ONNX as your export format, something you can do with a single line of Python or C# code. You don\u2019t even need to write the export statement into your training application; it can even be a call from an Azure Notebook or a statement in an Azure machine learning pipeline.\nMicrosoft also provides its own tools to convert models from some other formats, like Apple\u2019s Core ML, to ONNX. Microsoft\u2019s WinMLTools is a Python package, so you can use it with existing machine learning tools, like Anaconda. By integrating with familiar machine learning development environments, you can mix cross-platform data science skills with Windows developers\u2014using the same machine learning models that now run on popular mobile platforms, as well on Windows.\nIt\u2019s not all plain sailing: There can be issues with working with Core ML models that deliver image outputs, because ONNX doesn\u2019t directly support image types. However, Microsoft\u2019s WinMLTools documentation walks you through the process of mapping an ONNX output tensor to a collection of image files.\nOnce exported, that model can run on Windows\u2019 new machine learning platform.

This is fun,\" the pilot, Noel English, responded.\nAbout eight minutes later, the plane slammed into the wall of the canyon, which was flanked by ridgelines that rose nearly a mile above surrounding terrain.\nWhen rescuers found the wreckage three days later, they discovered one of the passengers had survived the crash only to die of internal bleeding and exposure, the NTSB found.\nWhen an unidentified passenger asked about the plane's route before the crash, flight mechanic Melvin Rowe told him, \"I don't know what we're gonna see.

The purchased music is stored in the cloud, can be accessed from different devices and could also be stored locally for offline listening, the company said. The store offers 19 million songs provided by 7digital, a digital media delivery company that has also provided music delivery services to Sony, Hewlett-Packard and Research in Motion among others.\nSamsung will offer a subscription service that allows users to stream all the available songs for $16 per month, Samsung said. Paying users are allowed to upload their entire music collection to the service and are also able to access a discovery feature that generates radio stations based on artist preferences, the company added. To reduce upload time Samsung uses a technology called Scan & Match that scans if a song is already available in the library. Only unmatched songs are uploaded, allowing users to listen to rare versions of the songs they have collected, Samsung said.\nMusic Hub users can also access their library on a PC through a Web player at musichub.com. The service has no advertising and offers unlimited plays, Samsung said, adding that people can search for music, create playlists, share songs and view lyrics and album information.\nThe technology for the service is provided by the wholly-owned Samsung Electronics subsidiary mSpot, which was acquired by the company in 2012. MSpot also runs white-label streaming services for Sprint, AT&T and Verizon.\nSamsung is not the first smartphone manufacturer to offer a music service to its customers. Apple's iTunes predated the iPhone, and it introduced its iTunes Match service last September, allowing $25-a-year subscribers to match their own music collection with the 20 million songs available in the library. The music is stored in the cloud and users are allowed to download the songs to ten devices including Windows PCs, Macs and iOS devices.\nMicrosoft also integrated its Zune music platform into Windows Phone in 2010, allowing users paid access to millions of songs and videos and making them available on PCs and the Xbox. The Zune syncing services are comparable to Apple's and Samsung's sharing of music via the cloud.\nOther comparable music services that are not tied to a smartphone manufacturer are available in some countries. A service like Spotify offers to stream more than 15 million songs to computers and smartphones for $10 a month, and also syncs music libraries to the service.\nApple has been able to successfully offer streaming media by integrating it across all of its devices, according to Giles Cottle, principal analyst at Informa Telecoms & Media. This is something Samsung cannot offer at the moment, he said. \"The most glaring sign of this is that its Smart TVs and smartphones are still built on completely different operating systems, making true convergence almost impossible,\" he said in an email.Without a good cross-device experience, Music Hub will \"simply be another paid-subscription and cloud music service in a market that is already starting to feel more than a little crowded,\" he added."}

Average hourly earnings increased 2.6% from a year earlier following a downwardly revised 2.8% gain.\nThe report signals the labor market remains strong and will keep driving economic growth, while the wage figures show a cooling from a pace that spurred financial turbulence last month on concern that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates faster. While the unemployment rate remains well below Fed estimates of levels sustainable in the long run, the rise in participation suggests the presence of slack that would keep policy makers to a gradual pace of hikes.\nFor now, rising labor-force participation may be a factor holding down wage gains. The participation rate increased to 63%, the highest since September, from 62.7% the prior month, the biggest monthly gain since 2010. The number of employed people in the workforce rose by 785,000, according to the report.\nFed policy makers are widely anticipated to raise interest rates when they next meet March 20-21 in Jerome Powell\u2019s first gathering as chairman. A bigger question is whether central bank officials maintain projections for a total of three quarter-point hikes this year, or boost the outlook to four.\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.1% from the prior month following a 0.3% increase, the report showed. In the 12 months ended in February, analysts had forecast a monthly gain of 0.2% and an annual increase of 2.8%.\nEmployees worked more hours last month, which also may have played a role in the wage numbers. The average workweek for all private employees increased to 34.5 hours, from 34.4 hours. The initial data for January had shown a shorter workweek of 34.3 hours, which had the effect of boosting average hourly pay.\nA separate gauge was more positive for wage growth. Average hourly earnings for just production and non-supervisory workers rose 2.5% from a year earlier, following a 2.4% gain in January.\nHiring was strong across the board and particularly in goods- producing industries. Construction businesses added 61,000 jobs, while factories boosted payrolls by 31,000. Service providers added 187,000 workers, including about 50,000 in retail, a sector that has been under pressure.\nGrowth in worker pay has been modest during most of this expansion, especially relative to how tight the job market is running. President Donald Trump has said the tax-cut legislation he signed in December will spur economic growth and boost jobs and wages. At the same time, his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports may become a headwind depending on how extensively they\u2019re implemented and how other nations retaliate.\n\u2022 The U-6, or underemployment rate, was unchanged at 8.2%; measure includes part-time workers who\u2019d prefer a full-time position and people"}

On top of winning acting accolades, the actress has proved over the last few years just how multi-talented she actually is\u2014singing live at the Grammys, dancing on Glee, publishing bestselling cook books, and perfecting her lifestyle Web site, Goop\u2014where one can find low-key video tutorials of the actress making family dinners and charming small talk about her days as a struggling actress.\nIn contrast to her public persona, which has now effectively permeated film, television, and computer screens, Paltrow seemed determined to keep her marriage private. Perhaps because of the scrutiny that came with her former high-profile romances with Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck, the actress worked hard to keep a protective barrier between her marriage and the Goop-reading public. Yet in interviews, she would speak frankly about the difficulties of marriage. Last year, for example, when Harper\u2019s Bazaar asked her about reaching her ten-year marriage milestone, she said, \u201cWe are growing into very similar people. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s not always easy though!\u201d Several months later, she elaborated to Glamour U.K.: \u201cIt\u2019s hard being married,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou go through great times, you go through terrible times. We\u2019re the same as any couple.\u201d It was these admissions which made the actress human, and her relationship relatable enough for us outsiders to feel sadness about her and Martin\u2019s separation.\nEven after these disclosures though, Paltrow\u2014one of Hollywood\u2019s most polarizing actresses\u2014still had a loyal set of detractors. While on the phone with Vanity Fair\u2019s editor-in-chief Graydon Carter earlier this year, the actress asked him for suggestions on how to get those swaths of Internet-commenting \u201chaters\u201d on her side. In his editor\u2019s note last month, Carter revealed that his advice was to put on 15 more pounds. And while Paltrow has yet to acquire any noticeable defects\u2014and based on all of Goop\u2019s cleanse literature, will not be gaining 15 pounds anytime soon\u2014 she has unfortunately stumbled upon another kind of perceived imperfection with which her non-fans might sympathize. If there is a silver lining in this sad personal matter for Paltrow, it is that her \u201chaters,\u201d also statistically inclined to separate, might be a little kinder towards the slightly-less-perfect Oscar winner in the future."}

For this reason, the choice of Durban as the venue for this week\u2019s United Nations World Conference Against Racism has deep and deliberate resonance. But South Africa has, perhaps unintentionally, now provided an even more powerful symbol for what the discourse of racism is really about: a national strike, organized by the labor federation Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), that took place on the eve of the Durban conference.\nThe Cosatu strike is a protest against the African National Congress government\u2019s \u201cneo-liberal\u201d economic policy, specifically, its plans for privatizing state assets and the consequent loss of jobs and potential decline of essential services to poor people. What Cosatu and the ANC are really fighting about is how to engage with the process of globalization. The government insists that it has formulated economic policy in congruence with international trends so as to make South Africa a significant global player, thereby attracting resources that will enable the economy to grow and the lives of ordinary people to improve. The labor federation, on the other hand, is striking a blow against this model, declaring that it is tailored strictly to the designs of the suits in Frankfurt and Washington, and that it has demonstrably increased\u2013rather than decreased\u2013the poverty levels of poor people in the south.\nThe ANC, Cosatu and the South African Communist Party have traditionally prosecuted the liberation struggle in alliance and now putatively govern the country together, but the trading of insults between former comrades has been so severe that it is difficult to imagine the alliance pulling through intact. Each side has publicly called the other a liar and a traitor. Cosatu\u2013buttressed by the SACP\u2013accuses the government of kowtowing to the global designs of IMF and the World Bank and of enriching a small, black, capitalist elite (the prime beneficiaries of privatization) while riding roughshod and arrogantly over the wishes and aspirations of the South African majority.\nThe government counters that \u201cstate restructuring,\u201d as it terms privatization, has been part of ANC policy since the early 1990s, and that its popular majority has actually increased since it released the contentious Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) macro-economic policy to which Cosatu is so implacably opposed. Furthermore, it accuses its alliance partners of irresponsibly washing South Africa\u2019s dirty linen in public\u2013and of engaging in gross opportunism\u2013by launching the strike on the eve of a conference that is meant to be a showpiece for South Africa\u2019s potential to overcome the conflicts of the past. In so doing, the state says, Cosatu has distracted attention from the fight against racism that is the conference\u2019s core business.\nHow does this play out in the conference? Firstly, the event has been overshadowed by the stale, old debate (which Kofi Annan has said will not be continued at the conference) about whether Zionism is racist\u2013a debate that seems criminally self-indulgent given the current conflagration in Israel and Palestine and the need for immediate action, and which has led to the unforgivable consequence of an official US \u201cdis\u201d of the event by downgrading its attendance to that of midlevel bureaucrats.

{"idx": "33793", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: What do you get from a live game-show app?\nTwice a day, HQ Trivia players tune in to a smartphone game-show app, where an emcee poses 12 wholesome questions, each with three possible answers. Players who answer all of them correctly split a cash prize. The winnings started at a few hundred bucks when the app launched in the summer, and now average around $1,500. But they go up to $10,000 or more.\nThe app, created by two former founders of the defunct short-video start-up Vine, has become a sensation. Around half a million people tune in each session, and less than 100 typically win, making the prize substantial enough to motivate users beyond the usual pleasure of quiz games.\nThat all sounds great. So why do I feel such dread when I play? It\u2019s not the terror of losing, or even that of being embarrassed for answering questions wrong in front of my family and friends. It\u2019s the dread that the app represents some awful, plausible future not yet realized, but just over the horizon: one where expertise isn\u2019t measured by knowledge, but by instinct tripped out on illusion.\nThis will seem like an insane claim to anyone who has played this fun, innocuous take on a game show, but trivia has a surprising history of social benefit. Quiz bowls were popular United Service Organizations activities during World War II, and in the 1950s they caught on in schools, on radio, and then on television. Group trivia also has a long history. The pub quiz appears to have originated in the United Kingdom in the 1970s as a lure to draw customers on slower weekday nights. That format spread, and many bars still host a weekly trivia night run by a live emcee.\nLikewise, there\u2019s precedent for digital quiz games. In 1985, a company called NTN started distributing a quiz called Buzztime to bars and taverns. The system standardized the format, and spared local employees the trouble of managing and operating the games.\nBy the mid-1990s, home computers had entered the mix. You Don\u2019t Know Jack took advantage of the CD-ROM format to deliver a full-audio quiz game on personal computers in 1995. Unlike earlier home-trivia trends, like Trivial Pursuit, You Don\u2019t Know Jack was saucy, bringing the adult context of pub trivia home to the PC. As the web became popular, fusions of television and internet game shows arrived, too. The publishers of You Don\u2019t Know Jack launched a puzzle game show called Acrophobia in 1997. Around the same time, a start-up called Spiderdance began developing interactive television, including games.\nIn all these cases, trivia games emphasize how broad, shared knowledge helps hold communities together. The USO and secondary-school quiz bowls offered both distraction from the trying effort of war and education, respectively, while also advocating for general knowledge as an aspiration for citizens. Trivia means minutiae, but sometimes knowledge of a wide range of details can allow a person to find an insight or make a decision that would otherwise have been impossible.\nBy the mid-20th century, specialization had mostly ended the dubious aspiration of becoming a Renaissance person, but at least trivia could offer tourism into various domains of knowledge.

Although Madonsela declared his appointment as acting chief operations officer and his exceptional salary hike at the time was irregular, Motsoeneng was inexplicably promoted by the board to a permanent position.\nThe promotion was endorsed by Muthambi, who is an active Motsoeneng champion. The SABC group chief executive officer, Frans Matlala, who was himself suspended this week, was Motsoeneng\u2019s line manager, and he was expected to have become involved in overseeing his disciplinary hearing.\nBut SABC staff said Matlala was \u201cdisempowered\u201d and actively prevented from becoming involved in Motsoeneng\u2019s disciplinary process.\nThe appointment of both the chairperson of the hearing, William Mokhari, and July was made by Muthambi. According to a board document, dated October 14, Motsoeneng and eight other board members were asked to ratify Muthambi\u2019s appointment of Mokhari and July in a \u201cround robin\u201d request they were sent and asked to sign. Two days later, Motsoeneng took a \u201cvoluntary leave of absence\u201d, pending his hearing.\n\u201cIn order to ensure the independence of the board in this matter, a request was submitted to the honourable minister to appoint an independent chairperson and pro-forma prosecutor in respect of the intended proceedings against Mr GH Motsoeneng,\u201d the company secretary, Theresa Geldenhuys, stated in the letter to board members.\n\u201cThe honourable minister has subsequently approved the appointment of advocate William Mokhari, senior counsel of the Johannesburg Bar, as the chairman of the disciplinary inquiry, and Mr Sandile July of Werksmans Attorneys as the pro-forma prosecutor.

Luckily, the Oregon Ducks\u2019 1995 Rose Bowl berth caught the attention of the school\u2019s wealthiest alumnus: Nike founder Phil Knight, who was seeking new marketing angles at the collegiate level. And so the University of Nike was born: Knight has so far donated more than half a billion dollars to the school in exchange for high-visibility branding opportunities.\nBut as journalist Joshua Hunt shows in University of Nike, Oregon has paid dearly for the veneer of financial prosperity and athletic success that has come with this brand partnering.\nHunt uncovers efforts to conceal university records, buried sexual assault allegations against university athletes, and cases of corporate overreach into academics and campus life \u2014 all revealing a university being run like a business, with America\u2019s favorite \u201cShoe Dog\u201d calling the shots. Nike money has shaped everything from Pac-10 television deals to the way the game is played, from the landscape of the campus to the type of student the university hopes to attract.\nMore alarming still, Hunt finds other schools taking a page from Oregon\u2019s playbook. Never before have our public institutions for research and higher learning been so thoroughly and openly under the sway of private interests, and never before has the blueprint for funding American higher education been more fraught with ethical, legal, and academic dilemmas.\nEncompassing more than just sports and the academy, University of Nike is a riveting story of our times.\nJOSHUA HUNT is a former foreign correspondent for Reuters in Tokyo. His work has also appeared in the New Yorker, the New York Times, Bloomberg Businessweek, the California Sunday Magazine, and the Atavist Magazine.

He has had the most prolific first four seasons in NFL history, at least when it comes to receptions.\nLandry broke Anquan Boldin\u2019s NFL record for most catches in first four seasons (342) in November, and has since obliterated it. Landry has 386 receptions in his career, and with two games to go this season, an even 400 is in reach.\nSo are two other Dolphins records: Most catches in a season (110, set by Landry in 2015) and most consecutive seasons with 1,000 or more receiving yards (two, shared by six players: Landry, Mark Clayton, Mark Duper, Irving Fryar, Brian Hartline and Brandon Marshall).\nThrough 14 games, Landry has 98 catches for 844 yards. He also has a career-high eight touchdowns.\nAs for the team\u2019s career receptions record? Assuming he re-signs and stays healthy, Landry should take ownership of that in the 2019 season. Mark Clayton caught a franchise-best 550 passes between 1983 and 1992. If Landry plays his entire career in Miami, he probably will set a new record that may never be broken.\n\u25aa Cody Parkey: If the Pro Bowl was merit-based and not a popularity contest, it would be hard to keep Parkey out.\nThe fourth-year kicker has been everything the Dolphins hoped he would be when they plucked him off waivers in September.\nParkey has made 18 of 19 field goals, including an impressive 6 of 7 from 40 or more yards. He has done it in every environment imaginable, including the cold wind of Western New York on Sunday. He knocked through a 41-yarder Sunday even though the Bills\u2019 big-screen operator put up an image of a flag blowing in a stiff wind \u2014 a clear attempt to get in Parkey\u2019s head.\nThe team record Parkey is chasing? Most accurate kicker in a season. He\u2019s currently at 94.7 percent and on pace to break Jay Feely\u2019s record (91.3 percent, set in 2007). Parkey probably cannot afford a miss the rest of the way. Connecting on four of five attempts would get the job done, but it\u2019s unclear whether he would get that many opportunities.\nBack to the Pro Bowl talk: Parkey is the AFC\u2019s most accurate kicker, but his low number of attempts and even lower name recognition could keep him out. Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski led all AFC kickers with 153,573 fan votes, which is one-third of the formula used to pick the teams.\n\u25aa Cameron Wake: The ageless pass rusher picked up his ninth sack of the season Sunday.

His shoot first ask questions later traits and cocky attitude make him a cut above the rest. Developer Ninja Theory\u2019s take on this video game icon split the original fan base. He was younger, cockier and....different. Me? I loved him; he quickly became one of my favourite video game characters ever. In Ninja Theory and Capcom\u2019s revamp of the Devil May Cry series simply named DmC: Devil May Cry, this new Dante and his brother Vergil join forces to take down the evil Mundus while Mundus hunts Dante and drags him in and out of Limbo, an otherworldly dimension where demons reside.\nThe levels in DMC have personality too. In Limbo, the environment is your main enemy as it constantly changes giving DMC a platformy feel whilst the abundance of enemies keeps our feet firmly on the ground with DMC\u2019s excellent combat. It flows like a urinating dog. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t take long before Dante is fully kitted out. With Dante\u2019s arsenal of his sword Rebellion, his guns Ebony and Ivory, Arbiter his huge demonic axe and Osiris an angelic scythe, Dante can form intricate combos to take down all demon comers. In this Definitive version, the action is silky smooth at 60 fps and never lets up and if it\u2019s still not enough, there is a new option to speed up the action. DMC\u2019s pacing is spot on as new enemies are constantly getting introduced and the story moves along at a good pace which helps keep your attention.\nSlaying demons and search every nook and cranny reaps its own rewards. Red orbs act as DMC\u2019s currency and white orbs go towards Dante\u2019s upgrade meter which when filled can upgrade his abilities which make the stylish action even more stylish. This definitive edition gets rid of the different kinds of keys you find in favour of just regular keys which open up all secret doors making things simpler.\nThe graphical upgrade means DMC looks amazing on PS4. More so in Limbo as there is so much to see like the beginning fairground part in which a huge Ferris wheel unhinges and rolls away while giving Dante his iconic jacket. It all looks outstanding as does enemies and character models. A little bit iffy however is the lighting. There is a lot of glare in places which is distracting but it\u2019s not significant enough to ruin the fantastic visuals and those boss fights are exhilarating. Match these awesome visuals with the unique personalities of smart arse Dante, humbled stick up the backside Vergil and evil dictator Mundus and we have one of the coolest action titles around today (No I haven\u2019t forgotten it is a remaster).\nNew features in this version is the aforementioned \u201cTurbo\u201d mode, \u201cHard-core\u201d mode which changes the whole workings of the game making things more challenging, a manual target lock system and all DLC such as Bloody Palace survival mode now with Vergil as a playable character and Vergil\u2019s side story as well as all skins.\nPrettier and stacks of style!\nThis new Dante is one of gaming\u2019s finest protagonists.\nSilky smooth fast paced action.\nBags of personality in characters and environment.\nAll DLC included makes the Definitive version the complete package.\nSometimes sound falls out of sync during cut scenes.\nLots of loading although they have shortened in"}

I'm clean and I've never been in a physical fight or hit anyone, but I have other issues.) I hate it, but at least I know what's been wrong with me all this time, and it really helps to know other people experience similar things - I was beginning to feel like I was all alone with my issues.\nThe two worst ways it manifests for me are the narcissistic rage tantrums and the mimicking of NPD relatives when I am stressed/feel insecure. I have these times where I feel so alone and hopeless and angry that I just start screaming and crying hysterically, sometimes for hours. It's usually after I make a mistake or cause a problem or do something wrong, I get \"triggered\" and it feels like my soul is shattering and everything I love and trust is gone forever, and I just have to scream. My mom and stepfather are at the breaking point about it, but nobody really takes me seriously when I try to get help, because I have an ironclad \"social\" self that takes over when I'm outside the home, and I can't open up even if I want to. Usually people try to blame my mom and stepdad, which is hilarious, because it's definitely my time with my drug addicted, wife-beating father with a severe personality disorder that traumatized me. Trust me when I say my mom and stepdad are kind, sensitive, smart people, and they are doing everything they can to cope with my disorder and help me get better.\nAnd then there's the \"mannerisms.\" It's like I can't be myself anymore when I'm insecure or under pressure, and for some reason, I start having the \"affect\" of my dad and his extended family (they're all dangerously arrogant and unstable as well.). It's like I don't have any personality of my own when I'm insecure, so I just graft onto someone else's. My mom has PTSD from the domestic abuse, and when I start acting that way, it upsets her so much she feels repulsed by me. It's really hard to be a person with NPD, and to know that people are repulsed and afraid of you, and feel like there's very little you can do about it. It makes me horribly self-conscious, and an occurrence of mannerisms often triggers a tantrum. And if you reply to this, please don't say my mom is imagining it. I agree with her I'm doing the mannerisms, I just don't know how to get self-aware enough of them to stop.(Also relevant, I found myself in a sexually abusive \"relationship\" about three years ago, and although I have since left that behind, I have been much more self-conscious since that experience.) I've thought about trying to train myself out of the mannerisms with poise coaching or something, but I'm very poor and I doubt I could afford the treatment I'd need to do any good. And please don't say \"it's okay to be awkward, just love yourself!\" or something like that.

Divorce is an unfortunate situation for many reasons, of course, but this was the first time that it had been assessed strictly through an environmental lens.\nThe researchers found that, when a household splits up, the two new households that replace it use between 42 and 61 percent more resources per person than before they separated.

{"idx": "33819", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Fifth Columnist, a Legendary Journalist, is one of the very few books written about the media scene and professionals in Kenya. It is certainly a book whose time has come or, indeed, which should have come earlier than its date of publication three years ago.\nIt tells the story of veteran journalist Philip Ochieng, who beat many odds to become one of the most celebrated media personalities of his time. He schooled deep in the village in present-day Awendo, Migori, and got admitted to the iconic Alliance High School, then under the unforgettable Carey Francis. We learn that Francis at one time had to go to Ochieng\u2019s rural home to persuade him to go back and complete school.\nOchieng had been a smoker and fell into bad company, the writer of the biography, Ms Liz Gitonga-Wanjohi tells us, quoting a letter that Ochieng wrote to Francis. The first time he ran away from school, he had been caned \u2014 a colonial practice that is now outlawed \u2014 and had bolted in protest. Francis had to drive all the way from Kikuyu to Awendo to speak with Ochieng\u2019s father to implore him to persuade his son to go back to school.\nThe author, who is also a journalist and academician, writes that a look at some correspondence revealed a boy who did not have it easy in high school.\nIn 1957, Ochieng\u2019 wrote a letter asking to be re-admitted, promising to abandon his \u201cfoolish ways\u201d and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. How ironic for the youngster who decades later would swear by all printing presses in Kenya that God did not exist, and declared that he was an atheist. That is the Ochieng who had adopted some key tenets of Marxism that has labelled religion the \u201copium of the masses\u201d.\nOchieng was among the top 10 performers at the end of his schooling at Alliance and got admission to a university in the US.\nHe was in the first student airlift to the US in 1959. The airlift was organised by politician and union leader Tom Mboya and his parliamentary colleagues, Gikonyo Kiano and Muriuki Njiiri, with the first flight involving 81 students. Ochieng was close to Mboya before and after the airlift.\n\u201cOchieng was having lunchtime beer (typical of journalists then) at a place [then] called Siqueras, right opposite Jevanjee Gardens, when somebody told him that Mboya had been assassinated.\nBut Ochieng never completed his studies in the US and elsewhere.\nThe author gives this issue quite some prominence, but stresses how the journalist\u2019s achievements and writing have all along shown incredible erudition.\nIt is a worthy read for those who want to learn how the Kenyan media has evolved since the early post-independence days. Having worked elsewhere in the world \u2013 including Tanzania, Uganda and in Europe \u2013 Ochieng also shares views on the East African and global media scene."}

And he's learned the sun does indeed rise over Gillette Stadium.\n\"I've never seen the stadium from this vantage point, but it's a great facility,\" Gonzalez said Tuesday. \"I will say everybody has been super nice and very welcoming. Despite what they told me in Indianapolis, everybody is really nice here. It's a great place, and I'm happy to be here.\"\nThe first-round pick out of Ohio State in 2007 spent his first five seasons with the Colts. He caught 94 passes for 1,240 yards and seven touchdowns in his first two years in Indy, but a myriad of injuries limited him to just five catches for 67 yards and no scores over the last three seasons.\nGonzalez, who turns 28 in September, signed a one-year deal with the Patriots. It was a low-risk move for the franchise that will reap valuable rewards if Gonzalez can stay healthy, though that will be the great uncertainty.\n\"[The past three seasons] certainly weren't how I would have hoped for them to go,\" Gonzalez said. \"I've learned a lot of things, and going forward, that's kind of in my past, I would say. It's a basic rule. I look forward, as opposed to back, and that's the focus I'm putting on it right now.\n\"I'm leaving all of that kind of behind. Right now, I'm here. I'm happy to be here, and I feel pretty good.\"\nGonzalez signed with the Patriots on March 17, but as one of the Colts' player reps, he had to tend to his NFLPA duties until the end of the month. He reported to Gillette on April 1 and has been working out with his new teammates and coaches for a little more than a week.\nDue to Gonzalez's success in the Colts' complicated system, he seems like a natural fit to get with the program in New England. Gonzalez's greatest contributions have been in the slot, but he's also got value on the outside, which should give him plenty of opportunities on the field.\nGonzalez hasn't spoken with quarterback Tom Brady yet, but the receiver played high school football with Pats backup quarterback Brian Hoyer. Gonzalez's sister has also been lifelong friends with Hoyer's wife, so there's plenty of history between the two, who have reconnected well in New England. And by showing up early, Gonzalez can work to learn the offense immediately.\n\"That's really my focus, whether it's with Tom or with Brian or with anybody, is just to learn this offense as quickly as humanly possible,\" Gonzalez said. \"I know just from watching that it's pretty complex, a pretty involved offense, and the one in Indy was, too. So that part of it doesn't worry me. But I do want to make sure when it's time to get on the field and go through things that there's no hesitancy mentally.

So it isn't so much that we're eliminat- ing jobs, we're eliminating the waste.\" As a zone leader, Stinson is respon- sible for about fifteen employees on a section of the production line that makes parts for Steelcase's Ology series--- height-adjustable tables built for the standing-desk craze. Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps, taking pains to remove the cor- rect parts out of a cart filled with vari- ously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the correct hole and in the correct order. Now com- puterized workstations, called \"vision tables,\" dictate, step by step, how work- ers are to assemble a piece of furniture. The process is virtually mistake-proof: the system won't let the workers pro- ceed if a step isn't completed correctly. We stood behind a young woman wear- ing a polo shirt and Lycra shorts, with a long blond ponytail. When a step was completed, a light turned on above the next required part, accompanied by a beep-beep-whoosh sound. A scanner over- head tracked everything as it was hap- pening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with iPads. Employ- ees who follow a strict automated pro- tocol---some call them \"meat robots\"--- need little training. Even the drill was attached to a computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial ro- bots assisted workers in their tasks. Now workers---those who remain---assist the robots in theirs. For decades, the conventional view among economists was that tech- nological advances create as many op- portunities for workers as they take away. In the past several years, however, re- search has begun to suggest otherwise. \"It's not that we're running out of work or jobs per se,\" David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the impact of automation on employment, said. \"But a subset of people with low skill levels may not be able to earn a reasonable standard of living based on their labor. We see that already.\" As automation de- presses wages, jobs in factories become both less abundant and less appealing. This process, Autor and other econ- omists argue, can also exacerbate in- equality.The labor market is built around the idea of labor scarcity: each person has a bundle of labor---his or her own capacity to work---that employers need and that she can sell in the job market through employment during the course of a career of thirty years or so. That model is eroding. \"It doesn't mean there's no money around, but it's just accruing to the owners of capital, to the owners of ideas,\" Autor says. \"And capital is less equitably distributed than labor. Every- one is born with some labor, but not ev- eryone is born with capital.\" In the Steelcase metal factory, auto- mation has led the company to seek out more highly educated managers, who are now expected to have a col- lege degree, not just a high-school di- ploma. The company, following the \"lean manufacturing\" model pioneered by Toyota, hires young engineers to scan factory data for additional \"e ciencies,\" which can translate into further auto- mation."}

As a result, HP slashed the price of its TouchPad tablet to $99 in the US and \u00a389 in the UK, seeing demand rocket for the device.\nCanalys said in its research note that the tablet was overpriced at launch and did not sell, leading HP to \u201cprematurely [conclude] that the product category had failed\u201d. However, the price cut helped to make the TouchPad one of the hottest products in HP\u2019s range of consumer electronics, \u201cgathering more interest than anything from HP in more than 10 years\u201d.\n\u201cThe TouchPad has become the \u2018must-have\u2019 technology product of 2011. Perhaps no other technology vendor, apart from Apple, has ever created such hype for a technology product,\u201d the research note said.\nWith a more aggressive pricing strategy, the hype around the TouchPad could help HP gain around a 10% share of the tablet market, which could double or triple the value of the company\u2019s PC division, currently valued between $8 billion and $10 billion.\nDespite the huge demand for the TouchPad, the tablet itself has not come in for favourable reviews when compared to its Apple and Android rivals. Developers have already begun porting Android to the TouchPad, aiming to extend the capabilities of the tablet and bring more apps, services and support to the device.\nThe TouchPad\u2019s components are also said to total around $200, so for the company to break even it would need to sell its tablet double the price when it was part of a firesale. That, and the impending launch of Amazon\u2019s Android tablet, would make it difficult for HP to secure a 10% share of the market.\nA low price and an Android port could help drive demand for the device but we believe the Canalys report is a touch optimistic, given the fact that other tablets from Motorola, Samsung and RIM have only made small inroads into sales of Apple\u2019s iPad."}

Yet, we understand that natural resource protection is a dynamic process and one that cannot rest in the face of the increasing threats of climate change and the uncertainty of federal government support.\nWe\u2019ve felt this acutely in recent years as we\u2019ve borne witness to record-breaking periods of drought, forceful flooding, wildfires that have destroyed entire communities and the presence of districts in our state that lack access to the most basic resources like safe, clean drinking water.\nAt Peninsula Open Space Trust (POST), we are grateful that Californians tend to accept that it is our responsibility to protect our unique natural resources through initiatives such as Proposition 68. It\u2019s smart to prioritize our natural resources that can act as a buffer against increasingly severe weather events, ensure access to clean drinking water for all residents, and provide safe natural places for our kids, and all of us, to play, experience nature, and thrive.\nThat\u2019s why we support Proposition 68, which will be on the ballot on June 5. The last time Californians chose to fund this level of natural resource protection was over 12 years ago, so it is time for us to stand up for our environment once again.\nThe measure was placed on the ballot by a bipartisan majority of the Legislature and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. It now requires final approval by California voters. Proposition 68 is supported by leaders and organizations throughout the state, such as the American Heart Association, Save the Bay, the California Chamber of Commerce, Save the Redwoods League, the League of California Cities, and many, many more.\nProposition 68 will safeguard the natural resources that POST and our generous donors have worked to protect for over 40 years. With voter approval, the measure will invest $4 billion in the coming years to address our state\u2019s parks, water, and natural resource needs. It will make critical investments to protect against the increasing threats of floods, fires, and mudslides, while also prioritizing investments in drought preparedness that will help us weather the impacts of future dry years. It will improve access to safe drinking water by funding cleanup of our water supplies and protecting our rivers and streams from further pollution.\nAdditionally, Proposition 68 puts the health and longevity of our local natural resources first by investing in efforts to restore the San Francisco Bay, will conserve and restore habitats and lands on the Peninsula and throughout the Bay Area, and ensure access to our open spaces, coasts, forests and other natural areas for all who live, work and visit here.\nAltogether, Proposition 68 will provide the funding that is critical to safeguard and protect the things that make the Bay Area a beautiful, clean, healthy and accessible place to live. At the same time, Proposition 68 has the teeth necessary to lay the groundwork for a self-reliant California, capable of meeting the challenges of today while preparing for the needs of tomorrow.\nThat\u2019s why POST has joined the bipartisan coalition of organizations and leaders throughout the state who are urging you to vote \u201cyes\u201d on Proposition 68 this June. A vote for Prop 68 is a vote for a natural, vibrant, and strong Bay Area and a bright future for California.

A Maryland flag runner practiced his celebratory route in the end zone. Fans with the state flag printed on their sleeves took photos of an empty field. The Terrapins\u2019 band filed onto the turf as kickoff approached.\nSince this summer, the game of football has become secondary for Maryland\u2019s program. The death of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair carried more weight than any on-the-field question. The tragedy, and the ensuing controversy related to allegations of an abusive team culture, has prompted two independent investigations and thrown the tenures of Maryland Coach DJ Durkin and other officials in doubt.\nWith offensive coordinator Matt Canada acting as interim coach while Durkin remains on administrative leave, a game finally emerged into the forefront when the Terps faced No. 23 Texas at FedEx Field. And just as Terrapins did last year, Maryland upset a ranked Texas team, this time by 34-29.\nAntoine Brooks Jr. sealed the win when he intercepted a pass by the Longhorns\u2019 Sam Ehlinger at the Maryland 11-yard line with 1:13 remaining. The Terps outscored Texas 10-o in the final quarter and forced turnovers on the Longhorns\u2019 final three drives.\nFreshman receiver Jeshaun Jones fueled the Terps\u2019 early success with a stellar debut. He scored touchdowns on each of his first three college touches \u2014 one rushing, one receiving and one passing.\nThe three-star recruit from Florida leaped onto the scene with a 28-yard touchdown run on the sixth play of the game, enough for a solid first college showing in its own right. But then he kept scoring. Four minutes later, Jones grabbed a 65-yard touchdown pass from starting quarterback Kasim Hill \u2014 the longest play of the game. On his next touch, less than seven minutes into the second quarter, Jones threw a 20-yard pass to Taivon Jacobs.\nThe Terps had a 24-7 lead, thanks to Jones and a strong defensive showing. But the Longhorns scored 22 consecutive points to surge ahead, forcing Maryland to muster the fourth-quarter rebound.\nIn the final quarter, the Terps\u2019 defense rose again. Brett Kulka recovered a Texas fumble, and Tre Watson intercepted a pass from Ehlinger. Maryland regained the lead with a 17-yard touchdown run from sophomore running back Tayon Fleet-Davis and an 18-yard field goal from freshman kicker Joseph Petrino.\nParticularly before kickoff, reminders of McNair were prominent. As the Terps ran onto the field for the first time this season, offensive lineman Ellis McKennie, a high school teammate of McNair, carried a flag with McNair\u2019s No. 79 written in white on red fabric. He rested the pole on his shoulder as the team congregated on its sideline. During a moment of silence, McKennie raised the flag, stretched his arm above his head and then waved it with fervor in front of an announced crowd of 47,641.\nThe team\u2019s captains carried McNair\u2019s jersey to midfield for the coin toss, and every Maryland player wore a red helmet sticker with McNair\u2019s jersey number. For Maryland\u2019s first offensive play, the team lined up with 10 men on the field, leaving a spot open for Jordan McNair"}

{"idx": "33844", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: For the first time in years, the number of New Yorkers who smoke has surpassed one million people. New data from the New York City Department of Health shows that 16.1 percent of adults identified themselves as smokers last year, which is a significant increase from the 14 percent in 2010. This is the highest number of smokers in New York since 2007. City officials blame anti-smoking campaign budget cuts for the rise. Given that the budget cuts for anti-smoking campaigns is a national trend, it is more important than ever for New York to dedicate resources to tobacco control programs.\nThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene\u2019s budget for anti-smoking programs has been cut to $7.1 million, about half of its 2009 funds. In 2012, New York State spent only 16 percent of the $254 million recommended as an anti-smoking budget by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, New York State has the highest cigarette taxes in the nation, earning about $1.5 billion in 2012. Given this level of revenue, New York should be able to lead the nation in tackling the issue of high smoking rates.\nAt a time when cigarette smoking is on the rise, New York City\u2019s budget must be adjusted accordingly to combat this trend. Anti-smoking legislation, such as advertisements and other programs that help people quell their addictions, must be given a higher priority in the city\u2019s budget. Specifically, these anti-smoking campaigns must be aimed toward younger generations and infrequent smokers, as they are more likely to start smoking. New York City has implemented campaigns, such as offering free nicotine patches and advertisements that discourage smoking. However, Christine Curtis, an assistant health commissioner, notes that the strategies have not been as aggressive as they were since before the budget cuts. Given the success of the city\u2019s anti-smoking campaigns in the past, it seems logical that the city would continue to invest in tobacco control programs.\nHowever, Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, said a program\u2019s success makes it more likely for its funding to be cut. \u201cWe have this terrible, terrible habit: we celebrate gains and the resources get pulled away from us,\u201d Benjamin said. It is easy for the city to allocate its budget to its most pressing issues at the cost of other programs. However, tobacco control programs, like many others, require a continued financial commitment in order to be effective. Without additional funding, there is little chance that smoking in New York will decrease at the rate it once did."}

It\u2019s on a ridiculous three times a week!) Each year, I would look forward to the pinnacle of the season: the double elimination episode, which was all killer no filler, and generally one of the most entertaining episodes of the season. Seeing as tonight\u2019s Survivor also boasted a double elimination of its very own, I was excited to see what fireworks the episode would bring. Perhaps my expectations were raised a bit, however, because this was kind of a snoozer. A snoozer with some highly entertaining moments, yes, but a snoozer nonetheless.\nThe banality really isn\u2019t the show\u2019s fault. There\u2019s only so much you can do to create any sort of suspense with the type of stranglehold Rob has on the game right now. It\u2019s now reached a whole new level, with him dictating not only the Ometepe team members' strategy but also their diet, who they associate with, and whether or not they go to the bathroom alone. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re grade school foster kids and he\u2019s their new daddy whom they need to please or else be forced to return to the group home. It would be frightening if it wasn\u2019t so darned amusing, although the charm of Rob does lessen each time he makes a smirking confessional comment about how he has this game all locked up. All we ask for is a tiny bit of self-deprecation to go along with the braggadocio, Rob.\nOverall, this double elimination was necessary to deal with the second Redemption Island twist, but ultimately, the episode didn\u2019t deliver much in the way of intrigue. Still, it gives us things to consider for the future. As I mentioned in the comments last week, I find it hard to see a scenario where Rob wins the game. This week only strengthens that belief for me: He\u2019s far too powerful, and he knows it. The more powerful Rob becomes, the more paranoid he gets, and the more he needs things to go his way. In the first All-Stars season, Amber was the perfect foil for this nervous energy and talked him out of a lot of silly moves. Here, he doesn\u2019t have this sounding board and only acts on his own (sometimes capricious) impulses, impulses that could be ultimately detrimental to his game.\nThe funny thing is, all it would take was for one small fraction of the Ometepe gang to realize that the time to switch is most likely now. If three Ometepe joined the other side, they could easily take down Rob before having to cannibalize themselves. The question is, does anyone there have the support (and the stones) to pull it off? Only time will tell, but even though I am highly enjoying the narrative of Rob the game master, it would be much more exciting to see him work with a wrench or two thrown into his works.\nPotentially interesting developments for the future: Rob plans on taking Natalie and Phillip to the finals. Phillip sagely recognizes his exact position in the game. Sometimes, the crazy might be brilliance, guys.\nHow was hanging by one leg in the second immunity challenge any type of sound strategy? Ralph, we can expect this from, but David should be smarter than that. Or so he claims.\nWith Matt, Mike, AND David all at Redemption Island right now, are they going to have a challenge where two of the three are eliminated next week?\nWhat happened"}

The production\u2019s popularity there didn\u2019t guarantee it would translate to success with urban audiences.\nBut subsequent runs in Montreal and elsewhere confirmed the broad appeal of this very smart, very funny play with a big heart and a brain to match. Corcoran\u2019s clever direction and perfect pacing showcase appealing performances by Crawford and Dunn.\nThey play Brett and Drew, a gay couple in Toronto struggling with traffic, their jobs (Brett works as an interior designer, Drew at a hotel) and their frustration trying to buy a house. They also adeptly transform into all the other characters in the story without ever exiting the stage.\nWith the help of reluctant contractor Doug they begin endless renovations. Eventually, they host their first three sets of guests \u2014 the uptight, the obnoxious and the horny \u2014 in a scene of wonderful comic chaos.\nAlong the way they meet the quirky townsfolk, becoming quick friends with pregnant coffee shop proprietor Alison, who prefaces each sentence with \u201cSorry,\u201d her Irish biker partner Chris, and their dogs Anne Murray and k.d. lang.\nA couple of high school kids are the actors\u2019 funniest creations: Dustin, son of the local realtor (\u201cOh my god\u201d), who loves baking, and Brett\u2019s nephew Cody with his constant shrugging refrain, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d played with deadpan hilarity by Dunn. Cody, surprisingly, has the play\u2019s best speech.\nThe comedy is leavened by the constant threat of homophobia. At first their gayness seems less an issue than an awkwardness in the small town. Drew bristles at Brett\u2019s desire to keep a low profile \u2014 no public kissing. \u201cI didn\u2019t give up my life in the city to move here and go back into the closet,\u201d Drew complains.\nBut when their house is vandalized and defaced with homophobic slurs, they have to decide whether to stay and fight or simply bail.\nCrawford\u2019s writing is at its best in weaving this dark current with the comedy. We hear about acts of kindness and generosity but the play offers no easy resolution. A surprise plot line towardthe end threatens, but avoids, melodrama.\nThe two actors make a terrific team. Tall, wide-eyed, slightly gawky Crawford contrasts nicely with the smaller, bearded, more intense Dunn. Neither misses a beat as they mime all the action, assuming a physical gesture or posture and vocal tic to switch characters, sometimes literally spinning from one to another in a second.\nJohn Gzowski\u2019s sound design is sparingly effective, offering the odd funny sound effect. But Dana Osborne\u2019s unadorned grey set is disappointingly dull.\nThoughtful and delightful, this Bed & Breakfast is well worth a visit."}

But though the food lines are advertised extensively, this is the first sustained campaign for the weight-loss programs, in which participants following the Weight Watchers diet meet regularly at Weight Watchers centers in a group setting for counseling and support.\nThe British-born actress joined the Weight Watchers program in 1982, eventually shedding 35 pounds. Since then, she has become an almost fanatical endorser of the program, not only appearing in ads for the company, but promoting it in numerous personal appearances.\nThe new commercial is part of a $20 million campaign that begins on Tuesday. In the past, the Weight Watchers program was only sporadically advertised; Ms. Redgrave was featured in a spot that was broadcast a few times in March.\nThe company, a unit of the H. J. Heinz Company, is increasing its advertising because it is faced with growing competition from other weight-loss programs like the Diet Center and Nutri System, and diet products like Ultra Slim Fast.\n''We saw the success Nutri System was having with its ads that showed before and after shots of dieters,'' said Tim Tully, the general marketing manager at Weight Watchers. ''We wanted to do the ultimate version of that concept.'' Mr. Tully said Weight Watchers, which has four million members, is the No. 1 program.\nIn the first commercial, Ms. Redgrave talks about herself as viewers are shown clips from ''Georgy Girl.''

This lack of clarity continues to leave the door open to possible enforcement actions, and also encourages federal agencies, other than FHA, to take action against lenders. Absent clarity, some lenders may continue to re-evaluate which borrowers they are willing to extend FHA backed lending to and at what prices.\nSeptember isn\u2019t even over yet and Stevens\u2019 concern over whether lenders would pull back from FHA loans is already happening.\nIn addition, Kevin Watters, CEO of Chase Mortgage Banking, said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that the FHA's loan requirements look an awful lot like subprime lending.\nStevens previously stated that issues like Wells Fargo\u2019s decision may not be isolated because of the proposed rules on FHA loans from HUD.\nHowever, Stevens noted that the announcement from Wells Fargo was not a surprise. \u201cThere are others that have already pulled back or may do the same,\u201d he added.\nUltimately, Stevens said, \u201cThe underlying concern that I have around all of this is that this FHA program is the entry point for homeownership for Hispanics, African Americans and first-time homebuyers.\"\n\"The impact of unclear rules from the FHA combined with the Department of Justice using the false claims act as an enforcement vehicle is a whole new world for this program that was made to create access to credit,\" he said."}

Working alongside associations like START Foundation and WSD, they employ the vulnerable: early school-leavers, the elderly, and people with a disability, who together make up around 70% of their workforce.\nRescued food can also make a quality dining experience according to Instock, a nonprofit restaurant chain founded by four Albert Heijn employees who saw how much food was thrown away and together sought a solution. With the financial support of Albert Heijn, they opened their first restaurant in 2014, serving dishes made from rescued food.\nToday, Instock has restaurants in Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, as well as a vintage fire engine which has been converted into a food truck which you can hire for your event.\nInstock serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Earlier this month, he began working at the GEO Group as its director of operations. The company is one of the largest contractors housing federal inmates. In fiscal 2018, for example, GEO Group has received $147 million in awards from the bureau, according to federal spending data. While Lara\u2019s memo went out to all bureau leaders, it mentioned only one facility by name: Rivers Correctional Institution in Winton, N.C., which is owned and operated by the GEO Group.\nThe GEO Group did not respond to several emails, and when asked about the hiring over the phone, a company official hung up. Government Executive was unable to reach Lara directly.\nJust prior to the memo\u2019s release, dozens of bureau officials, including Lara, attended a conference hosted by the American Correctional Association. The conference was sponsored by the GEO Group, among others. The bureau said it spent $153,000 on travel costs associated with the conference. The Washington Post reported last year that GEO held its own annual conference at a Trump resort in Florida, and that it donated $225,000 to a pro-Trump super-PAC in the run up to the 2016 election and an additional $250,000 to his inauguration.\nGEO Group has been one of the largest clients of the lobbying firm Ballard Partners since Trump took office, registering as a client in February of 2017 and since spending $850,000 with the group, according to lobbying disclosures. Politico deemed Ballard \u201cthe most powerful lobbyist in Trump\u2019s Washington.\u201d According to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 Open Secrets database, Ballard has held 355 meetings with White House officials and 56 with representatives of the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 parent agency.\nThe revolving door at the Bureau of Prisons is not new. CoreCivic, for example, GEO Group\u2019s main competitor in the contract prison space, has frequently hired ex-federal officials for leadership positions. Harley Lappin served as the bureau\u2019s director before transitioning to becoming CoreCivic\u2019s executive vice president and chief corrections officer. William Dalius worked at the bureau for 30 years, most recently as the administrative division assistant director and chief financial officer. He is now the vice president for operations at CoreCivic. Kim White was a regional director at the bureau and later the assistant director for human resources. She is now CoreCivic\u2019s assistant director of human resources. John Baxter spent 24 years at the bureau before joining CoreCivic and is now its vice president for mental health services. Charles Cox spent 23 years at the bureau, during which, according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he played an \u201cinstrumental\u201d role in developing the agency\u2019s \u201cprivate secure and community corrections procurement strategies.\u201d After his retirement, Cox went to work for Corrections Corporation of America, CoreCivic\u2019s predecessor.

Among them is a night of words and music at the State House on Feb. 12, the actual birthday. It will honor Lincoln, and call attention to the bust of Lincoln that graces the State House\u2019s Hall of Inscriptions. The work of Brattleboro\u2019s Larkin Meade, it\u2019s a study for the standing Lincoln statue that he created for the tomb at Springfield, Illinois.\nIn the afternoon of that same day, Vermonters will ring our bells as they did for the state\u2019s 200th birthday in 1991. Many bells that celebrated Union victories, and tolled on Lincoln\u2019s death, still grace our belfries.\nThey will sound down the Green Mountains\u2019 long ridge, along the valley of the Connecticut River, and across Lake Champlain. They will speak from the villages to the farms and fields, and be heard above the graves of lads who faced the fusillades at Antietam, Gettysburg, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor.\nYou may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming into line.\nAnd learing how to sew and reap against their country\u2019s needs.\nWe are coming, Father Abraham, 300,000 more.\nNow, hours away from the Lincoln birthday year, that Vermonters should join in the celebration seems altogether fitting and proper."}

The militia groups need to have alternative means of earning a living.\nYou say the new police force will not be armed. How has the 1992 UN arms embargo affected the training of the Armo police force?\nThere is no training with weapons. The goal is to establish a civilian police force, predominantly focused on human-rights protection.\nGender sensitivity and children and minority rights are at the core of the training programme.

{"idx": "33884", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Britain might have been totally unprepared for war in 1939 but within a relatively short space of time the country's economy had been placed on a war footing. Slowly but surely things began to change.\nThe defeat of the German air armada in the Battle of Britain during the summer and autumn of 1940 is well known. Without that victory Britain would almost certainly have been defeated. Thereafter, Germany turned to night bomber raids in an attempt to pummel Britain to her knees. But, to some extent at least, the British had learned their lesson and now the attacking bombers found they would not get their own way.\nBy the end of 1941 there were 23 night fighter squadrons operating around the coast, as well as numerous anti-aircraft guns, searchlight batteries and so on. One of the best night fighter units was No 456 Squadron, operating out of Valley aerodrome on Anglesey.\nOn 27 March 1942 Wing Commander EC Wolfe was appointed CO of the squadron. He was an experienced and capable pilot who was determined that his aircraft would play their part in helping to defend ports and industrial cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham.\nOn the night of 30 July 1942 Wolfe was flying a Bristol Beaufighter over the Irish Sea and Cardigan Bay, hunting for enemy raiders. With him in the two-seater fighter was Pilot Officer EA Ashcroft.\nTwo radar contacts were made, the first with an enemy Junkers 88. To Wolfe's annoyance the German plane managed to slip away in the darkness. The second contact, however, yielded much better pickings. As Wolfe later wrote in his combat report: \"I obtained a visual at 2,000 feet range and identified the aircraft as a HE 111, the exhausts on each side of the engines being very apparent\" (quoted in Fighter Command 1942).\nThe German Heinkel bomber was one of several on their way to attack Birmingham but had, obviously, become separated from the rest of the force. Wolfe immediately closed the range and opened fire. Two quick bursts were enough to make the pilot drop his bomb load which fell harmlessly into the sea.\nAfter another few bursts of machine gun fire, flames were seen to flicker from underneath the Heinkel. Wolfe later said that he thought the port engine of the bomber fell off - he saw something dark dropping away from the fuselage and, certainly, one engine was missing when the wrecked aircraft was later examined.\nThe Heinkel now went into a vertical dive from about 2,000 feet and crashed onto the beach at Pwllheli, very close to the fairways of the town golf club.\nOpinions vary as to the casualties. It is commonly believed that three men perished in the crash but the Royal Commission of Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales claims only two.\nThe gunner, in his position at the top of the fuselage, was killed by Wolfe's opening burst of fire.

As a result\u2013consider this your curious, yet little known, fact of the day\u2013anti-imperialism saved the American empire.\nFDR took office in 1933 looking not just to stabilize the US economy but to calm a world inflamed: Japan had invaded Manchuria the year before; the Nazis had seized power in Germany; European imperialists were tightening their holds over their colonies; and the Soviet Union had declared its militant \u201cthird period\u201d strategy, imagining that global capitalism, plunged into the Great Depression, was in its last throes.\nWhen, soon after his March inauguration, Roosevelt put forward a call to the \u201cnations of the world\u201d to \u201center into a solemn and definitive pact of non-aggression,\u201d the colonialists, militarists and fascists who ruled Europe and Asia balked. Because the new president\u2019s global reach came nowhere near his global ambitions, the London Economic Conference\u2013convened that July by the equivalent of today\u2019s G-20\u2013broke up rancorously over how to respond to that moment\u2019s global meltdown.\nMomentum was then building among Latin American nations for a revision of international law, which effectively granted great powers the right to intervene in the affairs of smaller republics. Venezuelan diplomats, for instance, were insisting that the US affirm the principle of absolute sovereignty. Argentines put forth their own \u201cnon-aggression\u201d treaty codifying non-intervention as the law of the hemisphere. Caribbean and Central American politicians insisted that detachments of US Marines, then bogged down in counterinsurgencies in Nicaragua, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, get out.\nYet Roosevelt, who had a way of mixing and matching unlikely advisors, also asked Ernest Gruening (recommended by Harvard law professor and soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter) to accompany Hull. In 1964, as a senator from Alaska, Gruening would become famous for casting one of only two votes against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which President Lyndon Johnson would use to escalate the Vietnam War, but in the 1930s, he was already a committed anti-imperialist.\nIn the pages of the Nation and other left-wing journals, he had helped expose the use of torture, forced labor and political assassinations that took place under Marine occupations in the Caribbean, atrocities he likened to European brutality in India, Ireland and the Congo. After touring Haiti and the Dominican Republic, he lobbied Congress to cut off the funding of counterinsurgency operations in the region, and he excoriated the \u201chorde of carpet-bagging concessionaires that are the camp-followers of American militaristic imperialism.\u201d That such an uncompromising critic of US diplomacy would be chosen to advise the Secretary of State reflects the strength of the left in the 1930s\u2013and Roosevelt\u2019s willingness to tap it.\nHull, whom"}

{"idx": "33904", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Japanese emperor's godlike status has not changed since the second world war, according to a new exhibit at the country's most popular war museum.\nThe slick, Shinto-oriented rewrite of history at the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo denies that Emperor Hirohito renounced his divinity in 1946, as most westerners and Japanese believe.\nYasukuni, which is dedicated to Japan's 2.2 million fallen soldiers, including executed war criminals, is arguably the country's most emotionally charged and controversial site. It is at the vanguard of the revisionist movement.\nThe 4bn yen (\u00a322m) renovation and enlargement of the shrine's museum, completed last month, goes to new lengths to roll back changes made during the allies' postwar occupation.\nA walk around the exhibits is a moving experience. Many visitors sob as they look at the photographs and letters of kamikaze pilots. Their sacrifice - made in the name of a divine emperor - is lauded by the museum, which blames the United States for prompting the war.\nIt dismisses claims that the spiritual status of the emperor changed after defeat.\nUnder General Douglas MacArthur, the allied occupation forces tried to eradicate emperor worship, which they claimed had stunted democracy and fostered militarism.\nThey pressed Hirohito to renounce his divinity - according to Shinto beliefs, he is a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu - which he appeared to do in an obscure new year speech in 1946.\nBut a museum display dismisses this interpretation of his words as propaganda.\n\"The occupation forces tried to sever the bond between the emperor and the Japanese people,\" it says. \"They widely advertised the new year statement as the 'emperor's declaration of humanity', but in actuality the emperor had done no more than to announce a return to the principles stated in Emperor Meiji's  charter oath.\"\nShinto, Japan's biggest religion, has 110 million registered worshippers but few Japanese worship the emperor.\nHowever, Daisuke Takahashi, a Yasukuni priest, said: \"Since the war, the view of the emperor has changed in society, but within Shinto it is the same as before: his ancestors are from the world of gods so he is a divine being.\"\nGovernment spokesmen have refused to comment on the Yasukuni interpretation.\nTakechiyo Orikasa, of the imperial household agency, said: \"The emperor's role is only that stated in the constitution as a symbol of the nation. Nothing more.\"\nBut ambiguity abounds. In Shinto, the gap between the human and the divine is far less clear than in a religion such as Christianity. Likewise the distinction between respect and worship has become increasingly blurred by agency officials, Shinto priests and conservative politicians.\nThe former prime minister Yoshiro Mori was speaking for many Shinto revisionists when he declared two years ago that Japan was a \"divine nation with the emperor at its core\".\nThe revisionist movement has made headway in recent years. Parliament has recognised the national anthem, which calls for the emperor to live 8,000 generations, and begun a debate on revising the postwar constitution, which separates state and religion.\nTo the fury of China and South Korea, the government has also approved school history textbooks that - like the Yasukuni museum - omit references to atrocities such as the Nanking massacre.\nFor more than a decade, prime ministers deemed Yasukuni too controversial to visit"}

Because people aren\u2019t allowed to park down the street, they come up here.\n\u201cBut our part of the street is narrower so they end up parking half on the pavement and half on the road.\n\u201cIt makes it hazardous for anyone in a wheelchair or motorised scooter trying to get along the street.\n\u201cThe tangle of parked cars also make it difficult for me to get out of my driveway and it\u2019s not just me.\nThe problem has been growing worse over the past year, Douglas Adamson, says.\nAnd one of the main reasons, he claims, is the lack of inexpensive parking in the town centre.\nThe situation seems to be one understood by the authorities but there has been little in the way of practical help so far from the relevant departments at North Yorkshire County Council and Harrogate Borough Council.\nDouglas Adamson said: \u201cThe highways department at NYCC wrote to one of my neighbours saying it would cost \u00a33, 000 to investigate changing parking rules on our street and there was no guarantee of success. That\u2019s a real insult to taxpayers.\n\"I am aware of this issue since I am the county councillor for the division in question, an area which includes the Duchy estate. I have been in correspondence recently with Mr Adamson, with other residents of Brunswick Drive, and also of nearby streets like Rutland Road.\n\"The parking of vehicles for long periods in residential areas close to the town centre and currently without parking restrictions is a problem which is getting steadily worse. It affects other areas of town too including the West Cliffes off Cold Bath Road, the area around Trinity Church, the streets near to Tewit Well, and especially roads close to Harrogate Hospital and St Aidan's School.\n\"Of particular concern is inconsiderate or illegal parking. The former includes parking on footpaths or hard up against dropped kerbs and driveways.\nThe latter includes blocking driveways ( I have recently had to contact the police and Parking Services to take action against the driver of a vehicle who had blocked a driveway on Rutland Road).\n\"As your article makes clear, our options to deal with this problem are currently limited.\n\"The introduction of parking restrictions on one road will transfer the problem to the next one, and so on. NYCC will be reviewing its policy on Residential Parking Schemes later this year.\n\"At the moment, no new schemes are being introduced unless there is third party funding.\n\"The current cost of a residential parking permit (\u00a315 or \u00a316 per year, depending on location) is far short of paying for a scheme, which requires setting up (if a majority of residents are in favour) including costs of advertising, after which there are further costs of signage, enforcement and administration. Increasing the price of a permit would alleviate the cost to the taxpayer.\n\"In short, officers and elected members at NYCC are very aware of the problem and intend to address the matter in the near future.\""}

In the shop, your feet will be measured, and then you can select the style you want or mix-and-match colors to any combination.

These movies\u2014and people underestimate this\u2014all six of the movies that preceded this . . . are determined by the director who did them.\u201d Kasdan says it\u2019s George Lucas\u2019s early \u201cebullience\u201d that gives A New Hope so much energy and Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner\u2019s art-house vibe that flavored the franchise moving forward. Kasdan says Lucas\u2019s idea to give the reins over to Kershner was the \u201cmost important decision in the entire saga.\u201d Now, Kasdan says, it\u2019s Rian Johnson\u2019s turn to pick up the story.\nMany fans may not yet fully grasped how important Johnson\u2019s involvement will be for the rest of this trilogy. Abrams and Kasdan both were very clear that they were only interested in doing one installment in the new trilogy. So in Force Awakens they may have done an admirable job teeing up the ball but it\u2019s Johnson\u2014who is writing both Episodes VIII and IX and directing VIII\u2014to bring us home.\nSo while it\u2019s unlikely, it\u2019s also possible that Abrams and Kasdan hadn\u2019t decided yet who Rey\u2019s parents are. There are glances and hints that suggest a number of possibilities. Han\u2019s look of guilt when Rey marvels at the greenery surrounding Maz\u2019s palace makes him seem like a neglectful father. Rey\u2019s emotional hug with Leia makes the general seem like she might be the girl\u2019s mother. But maybe that tearful, potent look between Luke and Rey in the final shot means that he is her father and we haven\u2019t even met her mother yet. Rey and Kylo Ren (n\u00e9e Ben Solo) obviously have a connection, but are they cousins? Sib"}

Roberts, who appeared Monday before Reno County District Judge Joe McCarville, was arrested in early May along with his wife, Melody A. Roberts, who has already been convicted of taking advantage of two elderly Hutchinson residents.\nIn court Monday, J. Scott Piper of Wichita testified his 81-year-old mother, Barbara Piper, had been living in Wesley Towers in Hutchinson, and Melody Roberts of Superior Nursing Registry was her primary caregiver. He also testified Tom Roberts also helped take care of his frail mother, who died Aug. 2.\nJ. Scott Piper testified he realized in April that someone had repeatedly used his mother's credit card without her permission between December 2008 and February, and exceeded the card's $7,500 credit limit.\nAfter looking over his mother's credit card statement, Piper said he saw \"big red flags\" such as $447 payment for an ALLTEL cell phone, although his mother didn't own a cell phone; large payments to Westar Energy and a City of Hutchinson utility bill, even though her bill payments came directly out of her checking account; payments to numerous local restaurants; and even $125 to Starbucks.\nHis mother rarely used the credit card and often used cash or checks, Piper said. Large charges were made on the card to Dillons, while at the same time, Barbara Piper had been writing checks for her normal amount of groceries, he said.\nOn April 8, Piper said, he changed his mother's home health care service and filed a fraud complaint with the Hutchinson Police Department.\nHutchinson Police Detective Paul Sack testified he investigated the individual charges to Barbara Piper's credit card and tracked the purchases. Video surveillance from various stores showed Melody Roberts making purchases and signing Barbara Piper's name, Sack said, noting the forged signatures were \"not even close\" to looking like Piper's signature.\nIn a search of the couple's home, police found items in the home that had allegedly been purchased with Piper's credit card, including DVDs and items from Peel's Salon.\nUnder questioning from Lee Timan, the public defender representing Tom Roberts, Sack acknowledged Tom Roberts was never seen on video using the credit card and only two receipts showed he used the card - both at a local car wash where he signed his own name and not Piper's.\nPiper testified Tom Roberts did sometimes take his mother's car to the car wash and she would pay for it, but his mother also said she never gave anyone permission to use her credit card.\nHutchinson police did not find any receipts in the Roberts' home connecting them to the purchases, Sack noted, and officers didn't search Piper's home to see if any of the items purchased with the credit card were there.\n\"There's no evidence (Tom Roberts) knew of the actions of Melody Roberts,\" Timan argued. \"It's circumstantial at best. The items found at the home were common items, and no receipts were found.\"\nIn his decision to bind Roberts over for trial, McCarville said there was no evidence Roberts had permission to use the card, but to his credit, signed his own name when he reportedly used it.\n\"He could have inquired where the items in his"}

He could begin by abolishing all surcharges and education cess. To high net worth tax payers, companies and firms, it will result in about 4 per cent tax saving (i.e. from 30 per cent plus 10 per cent plus 3 per cent = 33.99 per cent).\nIn any case, continuing these surcharges past three years grossly violates the basic tenet of levy of any surcharge - which is \"only for a specific purpose and only for a limited period\".\nSecond, there was no economic justification for \"education cess\". Providing funds for education of the citizens' children is of paramount importance and as vital as defense of the country from all external threats.\nIf the FM can levy education cess to meet the cost of education, then why not defense cess for defense cost, health cess, food cess, and so on. What are the tax collections meant for? Are the taxes that citizens pay only to be used to pay for bureaucrats' salaries and tax-free perquisites like palatial houses and battery of servants to look after ministers and politicians?\nIn any case, taxes like Fringe Benefit Tax and Bank Withdrawals Tax have been major irritants to citizens without corresponding large tax collections for the exchequer. The cost of collection of these levies and cost of unpleasantness that these two taxes have generated far exceed the tolerance levels.\nAny words of advice for the finance minister?\nYes, the tax administration needs to be made tax-payer friendly.

Podcast advertising there tends to be augmented by subscriptions, memberships and tips. As a result of more variable and aggressive monetisation \u2013 plus the enormous popularity of the medium there \u2013 podcasting may be worth more than $7 billion in China.\nYears ago, music downloads and streaming were seen as money-making businesses, whereas podcasting was something companies such as Apple facilitated as a kind of freebie. But now it\u2019s possible that Spotify sees podcasting as more monetisable.\nA song is a song is a song, and music is increasingly commoditisd through the primacy of streaming over downloads. But a podcast that streams valuable business content that could be expensed by executives, for example, could command far more than any album could. While music is largely a consumer product, podcasts are also important for business audiences, as well as for education, training, marketing and more.\nAnd even in the podcast advertising space, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth. In the US market to date, podcast advertising has been dominated by a short list of companies.\nMore importantly, podcasting would benefit massively from better metrics, personalised ad targeting, and other aspects of advertising that are common in other media but rare in podcasting.\nSpotify will also probably drive podcast listenership by matching listeners with new podcasts the way it does with music. (The company says it uses some 16,000 \u201csignals\u201d to personalise music recommendations.) It may pursue the Facebook model of employing powerful algorithms to drive up hours spent engaging on the platform, and also customise ad messages.\nOver the next 15 years, smartphones may be gradually replaced by ubiquitous intelligent-driven devices such as smart glasses, smart speakers and smart displays. The first generation of smart glasses will be primarily audio, with the sound delivered by innovative means, such as bone conduction. Our interaction with the internet will happen in large part through virtual assistant-mediated conversational interfaces. And our preferred content will be the spoken word."}

The majority of the cases are from an ongoing outbreak linked to Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, Calif. The CDC says the majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated.\nMedical officials have not yet determined how this year\u2019s outbreak began, but the CDC says measles were likely brought over by travelers from overseas. The people infected in the current outbreak have exposed others at the amusement park as well as schools, day cares, emergency departments, airplanes and outpatient clinics, the CDC says. In 2014, the U.S. had the highest number of measles cases reported in over 20 years, at over 600 cases.\nThe U.S. declared measles eliminated in the country in 2000, meaning it was no longer a disease native to the U.S. Strong immunization rates will keep it that way, which makes parents who do not vaccinate their children a concern to health officials.\nA recent poll showed 92% of physicians believe the current outbreak is directly attributable to parents not vaccinating their kids, and 72% believe unvaccinated kids should not be allowed in public schools.\nThe measles vaccine, called MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), is nearly 100% effective at preventing measles, which is a highly contagious disease. In kids measles can cause serious complications like pneumonia, long-term brain damage and deafness.\nThe CDC recommends all kids get two doses of MMR vaccine; the first at age 12 through 15 months and the second at 4 through 6 years.

He was also known to have used a blow torch on a previous job in Brewster, N.Y., in May of 2011.\nAs police began to investigate a spate of ATM thefts around the region, Moore, 39, a resident of Shelton, became a logical suspect \u2014 he had a previous encounter with town police for a commercial break-in in Greenwich in October of 2012.\nIn that 2012 case, Moore was arrested near the Shell station and convenience store at 1429 East Putnam Avenue in Old Greenwich, hiding in a BMW sedan after police arrived on the scene following a break-in there in the early morning hours. That arrest, and other criminal cases in Stamford, sent him away to prison for a year.\nIn an earlier case, in May of 2011, Moore, a former Stamford resident, was arrested in Brewster, N.Y., by New York State Police, along with an accomplice. The troopers found that a McDonald\u2019s restaurant had been broken into, and an ATM machine there was opened with a blow torch. Inside the trunk of his car, a BMW, troopers found cutting tools, the cash box from the ATM, two-way radios, a pellet rifle, rubber gloves, ski masks and pry bars, according to court papers. He was subsequently convicted on theft charges, the court papers state.\nThe investigation into a recent spate of ATM thefts in Greenwich encompassed the break-in at a vestibule in a commercial building in Cos Cob in February of 2018 and November of 2018, and the Shell station in August of 2017. Police gathered a range of information they said tied Moore to those crimes, which netted over $100,000 in cash, according to the affidavit. All were staged in the early morning hours, by a man dressed in dark clothing with his face covered, using a hydraulic power tool. The machines were all free-standing, not mounted in a wall.\nInvestigators determined that Moore was in Greenwich around the times the break-ins took place, the court papers state. Investigators also determined that Moore had purchased a hydraulic power tool from eBay, court papers state, and he had a curious history of bank transactions. \u201cA pattern emerged in which burglaries and ATM larcenies occurred in a short period of time after Joshua Moore\u2019s checking account balance fell to near zero or negative values,\u201d according to the court papers.\nThe accumulation of evidence led police to establish probable cause, authorities said this week, for an arrest warrant to be issued.\nMoore has a fondness for BMW\u2019s, having driven that kind of car through the years"}

Or: Whatever happened to market corrections?\nYou may not have noticed it, but the stock market suffered a correction about two weeks ago.\nSort of a correction, anyway: These market events are defined as downturns of roughly 10% from recent highs. The downturn on May 17, which took the Dow Jones industrial average down by 372.82 points, amounted to only 1.8%.\nNonetheless, financial pundits viewed the action as heralding a sea change in market psychology, tied to new evidence of the Trump administration's inability to get tax cuts done. Yet the very next day, the Dow gained back more than 56 points, and as of Tuesday's trading close, the average still was almost 50 points higher than it was before the big drop on May 17 (despite a fall of about 51 points from Friday's pre-holiday close).\nBoomers are going to live longer.... You can't fund a 30-year retirement with bonds or cash.\nThe truth is that corrections, which used to occur about once a year and last for a few months, lately have become shorter and less frequent; the last one lasted from the beginning of December 2015 to early February 2016, when the Dow shed about 12.5%.\nAs often happens, this trend has people speculating about whether a permanent change in the stock market has made corrections (as we used to experience them) relics of the past.\nThe dangers of over-optimism are well-documented, not least by the story of Yale professor Irving Fisher, who permanently destroyed a reputation as the nation's leading economist by declaring on Oct. 16, 1929, that stocks had reached \"what looks like a permanently high plateau.\" The stock market crash struck 13 days later.\nSo are the dangers of pessimism \u2014 witness one of the most famous negative prognostications of all time, the August 13, 1979, cover of BusinessWeek proclaiming \"The Death of Equities.\" The Dow was mired in the 800s at the time; it's now above 21,000. Investment markets of all types tend to encourage followers to believe that the future will be just like the present, except more so.\nThe key to Brown's explanation was a shift at major brokerages away from commission trading to fee-based asset management. Today more than one-third of accounts at some wire houses is fee-based \u2014 at Morgan Stanley, for example, the percentage rose to 42% in 2016 from 37% in 2013. Nationwide, assets in fee-based accounts can be estimated at nearly $3 trillion, up from less than $200 billion in 2005.\n\"The old investment business model was to get clients to trade all the time\" to generate commission income, Brown told me. Today's model is to collect a fee based on assets under management. The change doesn't entirely eliminate conflicts of interest between broker and client, but it does eliminate the incentive to churn the client's account.\nThe change in brokerage habits coincided with a shift toward passive rather than active mutual funds. The high-water mark of actively managed funds may have been reached in the 1980s, when Peter Lynch managed Fidelity's Magellan Fund from $18 million to $14 billion in assets during his reign from 1977 to 1990."}

Much like another highly-regarded pitcher, former Boston Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, Keuchel has yet to sign with a new MLB club, but recent reports suggest that the 31-year-old lefty is one of several pitchers whom the San Diego Padres have their eyes on as they seek to upgrade their starting rotation.\nCiting a subscriber-only report from Ken Rosenthal and Dennis Lin of The Athletic, Bill Baer of NBC Sports wrote on Sunday that the Padres are still in talks with Keuchel and his agent, Scott Boras. In addition, the team has reportedly been in contact with two other starting pitchers \u2014 Trevor Bauer of the Cleveland Indians and Marcus Stroman of the Toronto Blue Jays \u2014as of the first week of the 2019 MLB regular season, which kicked off on Thursday, March 28.\nWhile Baer pointed out that Dallas Keuchel has not been able to match his Cy Young Award-winning performance in the 2015 MLB season, the NBC Sports reporter described his performance over the last three seasons as \u201csolid.\u201d Last season, the two-time All-Star tallied a 12-11 record for the Houston Astros, striking out 153 batters in 204 2/3 innings and finishing the year with a 3.74 ERA, according to Baseball-Reference.\nA former seventh-round pick out of the University of Arkansas, Keuchel has spent his entire seven-season MLB career thus far with the Astros and, as Baer noted, could help just about any MLB team upgrade their starting rotation once he finally gets signed. He added that it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing for the sport\u201d that Keuchel and Kimbrel, despite their proven track records in the majors, have yet to find new MLB homes less than one week into the new season.\nRumors of the San Diego Padres showing interest in Keuchel have been swirling since late February when outfielder Bryce Harper was still the hottest unsigned free agent and less than a week away from his eventual decision to sign with the Philadelphia Phillies. As previously reported by Sports Illustrated, The Athletic\u2019s Rosenthal wrote that the Padres were \u201cmore focused\u201d on Keuchel than they were on Harper, despite the perception that he would be a \u201clong shot\u201d to sign with San Diego. It was also mentioned that the Padres were also looking at other pitchers to bolster their rotation ahead of the 2019 MLB season.\nAs of this writing, the Padres stand out for having an extremely youthful starting rotation, with the team\u2019s five starters having an average age of 24 years and 216 days, and Eric Lauer becoming the second-youngest Opening Day starter in club history at just 23-years-old, as noted by ABC 7 News."}

United have resided in Scotland's top division ever since, but Welsh's play-off claim to fame doesn't end there. Having been transferred to Hibs shortly afterwards, there he was, back reliving the ordeal in the colours of the Easter Road club 12 months later, as they secured their survival against Airdrieonians by a 5-2 aggregate margin. How Hibs, despite a 2-0 advantage from the first leg, would take a similar result against Hamilton this afternoon.\n\"I played in back-to-back play-offs, in fact I am probably the only man in history to do so,\" Welsh told the Sunday Herald. \"I enjoyed them because they are big games, but they are certainly a bit nervy. They did away with them but I don't think they should have done. It was great excitement and drama for everyone.\"\nAs it turns out, Welsh's enjoyment of the Partick Thistle game is rather spoiled by the audio.\n\"I have watched that goal a couple of times, and the commentator says 'for once Brian Welsh puts it in the net',\" recalled the rugged central defender. \"I always think 'you cheeky b*****d, you have just spoiled that goal for me forever'.\n\"But I was pumped up and I remember after scoring that goal, with the confidence we had, there was only going to be one winner,\" he added. \"At the end of normal time, I couldn't stand still, there was so much adrenalin flowing.

Representatives of Commonwealth countries in Ghana and the Acting Dean of the Diplomatic Corps also laid wreaths. Nii Kpobi Tetteh Tsuru La Mantse laid one on behalf of chiefs, while Lt. Gen. Albert Okae, Chairman of VAG, also laid one for the veterans.\nThe knell sounded, the siren blew and the Binyon verses were read before the last post sounded and a two-minute silence was observed. Flags from Commonwealth countries that took part in the World War One and Two were hoisted during the service.\nIn 1918 the armistice, which ended World War One became effective at 1100 hours of November 11 when the guns fell silent on the Western Front in France and Belgium to draw down the curtain on four years of hostilities.\nThe day was called the Armistice Day, after World War Two and was later renamed Remembrance Day to remember those who were killed in both wars.\nMany countries have recognised that the day does not only symbolises the sacrifices of those who fell in the two World wars but also those who have died in subsequent conflicts around the world, including Ghanaians serving on peacekeeping duties. Other dignitaries who attended the service included Mr A.K. Deku, Acting Chairman of the Council of State, Mr Justice George Kingsley Acquah, Chief Justice, Service Commanders and Ministers of State."}

Over the course of their investigation, police found out that two groups of students were fighting near the cafeteria and the teacher who tried to intervene was hit and fell to the ground. Several students then accidentally fell on the teacher.\nSurles said other fights broke out among students elsewhere in the school, resulting in multiple charges against the seven juveniles, including mob action and resisting or obstructing a police officer.\nPolice said Adrian C. Pettis, 35, of Urbana, who had to come to the school, was arrested on charges of resisting/obstructing a police officer.\nWhile the exact number of students involved wasn't immediately known, \"I can confirm that there were a lot of people,\" Surles said.\nThe severity of the situation led to Urbana police requesting backup and receiving assistance from other law-enforcement agencies, including Champaign and University of Illinois police and Champaign County sheriff's deputies.\nA motive for the fight is also currently unclear, Surles added.\nAll Urbana High students were dismissed at 1:25 p.m. \u2014 a decision Surles said the school consulted with his department about but made on its own.\nParents said they were upset that communication from the school didn\u2019t immediately indicate that police had been called or give a detailed reason for the decision.\nIn a one-line email sent to parents at 1:06 p.m. \u2014 less than 20 minutes before all students were dismissed \u2014 Principal Deloris Brown wrote, \"Due to the repeated altercations and incidents today, we will be releasing students for the remainder of the day at 1:25 p.m.\"\nCalls and texts that were also sent to parents to inform them of the early dismissal also didn't mention why it was occurring.\n\"I want to give them the benefit of the doubt dealing with the safety of things at hand,\" said parent Dana Mancuso. \u201cThere needed to be additional information about who was affected by the incidents in order to alleviate concern.\"\nExtra police will be on site for Tuesday's classes, according to a press release sent jointly from police and the Urbana school district.\nURBANA \u2014 Students are being dismissed early following a fight early Monday afternoon at Urbana High School.\nParents were notified that students were being let out at 1:25 p.m. Calls to the school went directly to voicemail.\nMultiple police units and at least one firetruck and ambulance were dispatched to the high school early in the afternoon after reports of a fight.\nA science teacher was reportedly among those injured in a fight near the lunchroom, students told News-Gazette Media.\nThe Urbana Police Department did not comment on the situation.\nPolice remain on the scene."}

Personally, we\u2019re a huge fan of these sort of nights: you know, the ones where they drag out the only bit of information you\u2019ve tuned in for, slip in a few guest performances, and blatantly hawk products of big-spending advertisers.\nBut surprisingly, things got down to business rather quickly. The way it worked is that for each three acts brought onstage, one act was revealed to be advancing to the next round.\nUp first was Michael Nejad, the multi-instrumentalist who plays baseball bats and brooms as instruments and got blasted by Howard Stern on Monday; Shanice and Maurice Hayes, the father-daughter singing duo who delivered a stellar performance; and Nikki Jensen, the Australian singer who unleashed a rather dull rendition of Coldplay\u2019s \u201cThe Scientist.\u201d So who made it through? The Hayes \u2013 no surprise there. \u201cWe thank God for the pleasure of being here to perform,\u201d Maurice said after the announcement.\nAfter a performance from Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Zarkana, which included bouncing tennis balls, some tap dance, ballet, and a dude flipping 15 feet in the air only to land on another dude\u2019s shoulders, the next trio of acts up for elimination were brought onstage.\nWho was in the next trio? David Garibalidi and his CMYK\u2019s, the standout act on Monday who combined painting and dance and produced a killer portrait of Mick Jagger; Jarrett and Raja, the magician duo booed offstage after a laughable performance; and American BMX Stunt Team, a collection of X Games types who likely spend most of their money on things like front and back pegs. We were a little disappointed with this group before the results were even announced; we\u2019d hoped that both BMX and Garibaldii would advance. But it was not to be. The act advancing is \u2026 David Garibalidi and his CMYK\u2019s. Another non-shocker. America seems to be getting this thing right so far. \u201cWe just feel grateful right now,\u201d Garibaldi said.\nBefore the final act to advance was revealed, will.i.am performed his new Eva Simons-featuring single, \u201cThis Is Love.\u201d Wearing all white and playing a matching baby grand piano, the Black Eyed Peas frontman busted out what sounded like a completely Auto-Tuned song (again, no shockers tonight).

You know better than to show up an hour late to meet the parents of your future spouse for the first time. That's because you realize the importance of first impressions. For businesses, logos are often the first thing people notice. Therefore, it's important your logo makes a memorable first impression.\nBusiness owners know that establishing a relationship with your customers is of the highest importance. That relationship can't exist if potential customers are either turned off by their first impressions, or your business isn't remarkable enough to stick in their memories.\nBecause your company logo is the face of your brand, the process of developing your logo should not be taken lightly. If you're having trouble coming up with a logo that connects customers with your business and mission, it might be worth spending the money to hire a logo design company to help you come up with an icon that strengthens your brand.\n* Tap emotion: If you are running a small business, an edge you have on your larger competitors is your ability to more easily connect with your customers on an emotional level. If you own a grocery store that specializes in offering local produce, your logo should convey freshness and remind your customer of the benefits of shopping locally. A good logo makes a customer feel good about making the choice to do business with you.\n* Connect to customers: Everything that comes out of your store or appears on your website should feature your company's logo. By giving away something useful like key chains or pens to your customers with your logo on it, you'll foster positive associations with your business for your customers. Of course, remembering the names of your customers when they walk in the door and providing superior customer service in comparison to your larger competitors doesn't hurt either.\n* Create character: How does your business make your customers' lives better? This should not only be reflected in your mission statement, but in your logo. Displaying the reason for your existence through your logo is the best way to remind your customers that you are there to serve them.\nFor more guidance on creating successful logos and information on logo design services, visit www.logomojo.com."}

But, year after year, the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality meets there to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\nDefending life means \"walking in a way that is out of step with the world,\" said retired Bishop Timothy Whitaker, former president of the denomination's Board of Discipleship. While there are secular people who oppose abortion, he focused his Jan. 18 sermon on why this issue has become so crucial to modern Christians who strive to affirm ancient Christian doctrines.\n\"Unless a part of the church is compromised by being conformed to the world,\" said Whitaker, \"becoming a Christian profoundly changes one's perception of reality and one's behavior. ... That is why the church is loved by many, as well as hated by many.\"\nWhen the March for Life makes headlines, it is almost always for political reasons, such as this year's remarks by Vice President Mike Pence and a video-chat from President Donald Trump.\nThe massive march also serves as a hub for dozens of smaller events, with groups ranging from Episcopalians for Life to Feminists for Life, from Pro-Life Humanists to the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians. Almost all mainstream religious groups \u2014 including progressive flocks \u2014 include a pro-life caucus of some kind.\nFor decades, United Methodists were powerful supporters of the interfaith Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, ties that were cut by delegates at the denomination's 2016 General Conference. That same conference defeated a motion to retain an old affirmation of Roe v. Wade.\nNevertheless, the UMC homepage notes that the denomination's Social Principles include two statements that remain in tension: \"Our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion. But we are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother and the unborn child.\"\nRather than focus on modern arguments, Whitaker discussed a doctrinal statement called the Didache, which most scholars say was written in the first century. Addressing \"Gross Sins,\" it states: \"You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit pederasty, you shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal, you shall not practice magic, you shall not practice witchcraft, you shall not murder a child by abortion nor kill that which is begotten.\"\nThe bishop called the church of the first three centuries the \"primitive church\" and \"the once and future church.\" Right now, the problem is that ancient Christian doctrines are clashing with evolving moral norms in the modern world, creating anxiety among those who believe the church's true mission is \"finding a way forward,\" while trying to express the \"highest ideals and values"}

It\u2019s not like there\u2019s no other place to do it. Just because some interests with important connections want it there doesn\u2019t mean it has to go there. I\u2019m a parks guy. I feel that parks are sacred,\" Garcia was quoted by the Sun-Times as saying.\nIn late December, the Obama foundation let it be known publicly that it had serious concerns about the University of Chicago's bid \u2014 in particular, the school's failure to prove it could secure the Chicago Park District land on which it was proposing to build. That set off a scramble by university officials and Emanuel, and earlier this month, the park district's board voted unanimously to transfer 20 acres to the city, to be leased to the foundation if the University of Chicago gets the library.\nObama's foundation said the move had improved Chicago's bid, in yet another indication that the University of Chicago was on track to win the library.\nYet a small but outspoken group of opponents, led by the nonprofit Friends of the Parks, has continued to argue that officials have yet to prove the Obama legacy project is worth the land-grab from city park-goers.\nThe University of Chicago bid is in competition with one from the University of Illinois at Chicago, as well as bids from Columbia University in New York and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. Obama is expected to select a winner within weeks.\nOn Thursday, the Associated Press and the Sun-Times, both citing sources, reported that South Side residents were recently polled to gauge support for the project on public land. The Sun-Times report indicated that just 24 percent of those polled opposed using Washington and Jackson park land if one of those sites is chosen.\nWhile in town last week, Obama stopped by his family home near the University of Chicago's campus for an update on the selection process by the foundation's chairman, but the White House said no decision was made at that time.\nEmanuel on Tuesday failed to garner enough votes to win the mayoral election outright, extending his campaign against Garcia, his closest challenger, another six weeks.

The company also sells building materials, including recycled paint.\nDuring a recent interview, Sullivan discussed batteries, Budapest and buffalo nickels.\nSullivan: In Spokane. I attended Lewis and Clark High School.\nSullivan: I was really interested in archaeology \u2013 the digs sounded fascinating \u2013 but I became an elementary school teacher instead.\nSullivan: I was a car hop at the Top Hat drive-in on East Sprague. I worked three summers while attending Eastern (Washington University).\nS-R: What did you do after graduating?\nSullivan: I taught second grade in the Central Valley School District for one year, then taught two years in Vancouver, Washington, and subbed for another five. After baby number three, I quit altogether.\nS-R: Did you have any other careers before launching your own business?\nSullivan: In the early \u201990s, I worked as office manager for a company that sold waste-oil heaters. My brother came on as a salesman. When one of the owners died, the other decided to close the business. Bruce already had $40,000 in proposals written, so I went to SCORE (a nonprofit organization that provides free mentoring) with a business plan. It took three tries, but we eventually opened with a $25,000 SBA startup loan, a phone, a fax and two file boxes in the trunk of my car. After we did our first solar-energy system in 1999, Bruce suggested we change our name to Eco Depot.\nS-R: Did any skills learned in earlier careers transfer to this job?\nSullivan: I learned about money management from the owners of the waste-management business during the five years I worked there. For instance, don\u2019t use the business as your personal cookie jar and don\u2019t spend more than you take in.\nS-R: When you transitioned to solar packages in 1999, how mainstream were photovoltaics?\nSullivan: Not very. But Jim Sheehan, who owns the Saranac and the Community Building downtown, asked us to install solar. The Community Building was our first commercial project.\nS-R: Have government incentives played a role in stimulating interest in solar energy?\nSullivan: Yes. Besides a 30 percent federal tax credit on PV systems, Washington is a net-metering state (meaning utilities must reimburse residential producers of excess solar-generated electricity). For a while, Avista paid customers 54 cents per kilowatt hour, up to $5,000 a year. And until last October, we didn\u2019t have to charge sales tax on solar equipment.\nS-R: How has the business evolved?\nSullivan: Sales have been up and down. I wasn\u2019t sure we were going to make it in 2008. There were months I didn\u2019t pay myself, but that\u2019s part of being a business owner.\nS-R: What did you learn during the lean years?\nSull"}

I\u2019ll first take a look at the problems that are unique to this film.\nThe plot of this film is way too complicated, while also having very low stakes. The plot basically centers around everyone looking for Credence and features a lot of really bland scenes of people just walking around shadowy places. It doesn't feel like the plot is building to anything, which makes it very uninteresting. It introduces way too many side characters, most of whom get pushed to the back by the end of the film and really don\u2019t do much throughout the story. Every single character in this film has a sidekick, who really doesn't do anything and just follows their counterpart around for the whole movie.\nAnother problem in this film is that it relies heavily on fan service. By that I mean that it relies on too much nostalgia for the Harry Potter series. Some examples are the use of Nagini, who was just Voldemort's snake in the other films but is shoehorned into this film because fans remember her, Nicolas Flamel who created the Philosopher's Stone from the first Harry Potter film and Dumbledore who, despite being at the forefront of the marketing for this films, appears for only a handful of scenes. So if you\u2019re going in hoping to see a lot of young Dumbledore, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\nThe film is plagued by a problem that has been carried over from past films. This film looks boring. What I mean is that, visually, this film is very uninteresting. It uses a lot of muted colors and greys, which adds no style of flare to the way this film looks. The sets are mostly just dark empty spaces and hallways. This is a movie about wizards and magic beasts, the visuals should reflect the awe and wonder of what the audience is experiencing. Instead the entire film feels like the whole world is having a funeral.\nIt should be bright and visually interesting, similar to the first four Harry Potter films. Those four films had an air of wonder and mysticism that used lots of colour and have interesting set design. Every movie going forward is looks bare and drab. Perhaps this is due to David Yates taking over directing of these films from that point forward and that this is his style. If that is the case, his style is not suited for a world of wizards and witches as it has been"}

With the half-time score at 1-1 Horsham thought they were still in the game with a definite chance. They reckoned without the specialist short corner goalscoring Harden.\nLast season Harden scored 40 goals from short corners. According to his team mates this term he\u2019s having a bad year \u2013 he\u2019s only on 25.\nTo be fair, Horsham goalkeeper Joe Elgar had an exceptional game between the sticks, keeping out the best Blackheath could throw in open play. But Harden is a goal-scoring machine and last Saturday at Christ\u2019s Hospital he was on fire. Elgar couldn\u2019t keep him out.\nHorsham started brilliantly, composed and in control and giving as good as they got from a Blackheath team ten points above them in the league.\nWithin six minutes they were on the scoreboard, Zak Chinn, set loose by a superb aerial pass from Sean Pearcy, left one-on-one with the Blackheath \u2018keeper. Chinn used his lightning pace to draw the goalkeeper, sidestep and push the ball into the net.\nHorsham, who started with only 13 players due to injury and illness, as opposed to Blackheath\u2019s full complement of 16, then lost Joey Humphreys to a broken nose.\nDespite that they edged possession for the next 27 minutes, playing good probing passing hockey, keeping Blackheath out of their red zone.\nIt couldn\u2019t last for ever but, when Horsham finally gave away a shot corner four minutes from half-time, nobody quite anticipated the outcome. Up stepped Harden for Blackheath and pinged it past Elgar\u2019s outstretched left hand before he had time to blink.\nIn the second half, Blackheath seemed to focus their minds on winning short corners. Three more times Harden obliged. In between times, play was even and Horsham had chances. Skipper Rob Turnbull hit the post and Chas Richardson went close, but the Blackheath keeper had a good game.\nTowards the end, Horsham tired and Blackheath added two field goals. But by then the game was done and dusted.\nHorsham still reside in ninth place and are safe from relegation. They can, however, move eighth if they beat London Academicals, who are currently one point above them, this Saturday."}
{"idx": "33998", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Doctors will find it easier to tell whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or another kind of dementia with a new method of using MRI scans, researchers from Perelman School of Medicine and Frontotemporal Degeneration Center at the University of Pennsylvania explained in the journal Neurology.\nThe scientists say they could fairly accurately identify Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration without having to carry out invasive tests, such as a lumbar puncture, which involves sticking a needle into the spine. At the moment, diagnosing dementia is a struggle for doctors, which often results in delayed treatment. Invasive tests can help, but patients find them unpleasant.\nAlthough their underlying disease processes are quite different, FTLD (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) and Alzheimer's disease can frequently share the same symptoms, making it hard for experts to make an accurate diagnosis.\nPatients with Alzheimer's or FTLD both experience confusion and forgetfulness - their diseases/conditions can affect their emotions, behavior and personalities.\nDuke University researchers recently found that by combining the results of three tests, doctors could more accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease. The tests included MRI, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (lumbar puncture).\nFinnish researchers developed a software tool that could reduce the average time to reach a diagnosis of Alzheimer's from 20 months to 10 months.\n\"Diagnosis can be challenging. If the clinical symptoms and routine brain MR are equal, an expensive positron emission tomography (PET) scan might be needed. Or, a lumbar puncture, which involves inserting a needle into the spine, would be needed to help make the diagnosis.\nAnalysis of the cerebrospinal fluid gives us reliable diagnostic information, but this is not something patients look forward to and is also expensive. Using this new MRI method is less expensive and definitely less invasive.\"\nMcMillan and team carried out a study involving 185 participants. They had all been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease which indicated either FTLD or Alzheimer's. They underwent a high resolution MRI scan as well as a lumbar puncture. Diagnosis was confirmed in 32 of the participants either by autopsy or by determining that they had a genetic mutation linked with either FTLD or Alzheimer's.\nThe team wanted to determine whether they could dispense with the lumbar puncture altogether and predict brain protein levels by using just MRI brain scans.\nThe MRI scans were used to predict the ratio of two biomarkers of FTLD or Alzheimer's - the proteins tau and beta-amyloid - in the lumbar punctures (cerebrospinal fluid).\nThey found that by studying the structural brain patterns - the density of gray matter - on the MRI scans, their predictions were 75% accurate when confirming diagnosis with people who had pathology-confirmed diagnoses and those with biomarker levels retrieved from lumbar punctures - this shows that the new MRI use is as accurate as lumbar puncture methods.\n\"Developing a new method for diagnosis is important because potential treatments target the underlying abnormal proteins, so we need to know which disease to treat. This could be used as a screening method and any borderline cases could follow up with the lumbar puncture or PET scan.\nThis method would also be helpful in clinical trials where it may be"}

Because cellular handsets account for 40% of the company&apos;s revenues, investors hammered Motorola&apos;s stock down 18%, to $122, on Tuesday.\nThe company said that it expects second-quarter earnings to come in around 67 cents per share, lower than consensus estimates of 70 cents per share. The company&apos;s new broadband division did better, with sales increasing 15%, to $678 million, and orders jumping 46%, to $880 million. Operating profits rose 49%, to $91 million, boosting the division&apos;s margin from 10% to 14%.\nAccording to division President Ed Breen, the division has now shipped 7.3 million of the first generation of digital set-top converters, and Motorola has supplied systems with 1,100 digital headends, accounting for 50% of cable households."}
