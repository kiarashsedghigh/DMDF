This is because inflationwill creep back up to 4 percent for much of 2013 and China will need to put up with slower growth in order to implement reforms, Research Analysts Wendy Liu and Vicky Fung said in a report published on Monday.\nFor now, traders looking for a short-term opportunity to buy will benefit from low valuations in the MSCI China Index, which is trading at close to 9 times current earnings, and an economy that is expected to bounce back from a government-engineered slowdown.\nThe MSCI China Index was trading at 52.22 as of July 23, according to latest weekly data from Datastream, Fung said. A slow-down in the economy had weighed on Chinese stocks for much of the year, with GDP growth decelerating to a three-year low of 7.6 percent in the second quarter.\nNomura believes that June was the turning point for both equities and the economy. China\u2019s quarterly GDP growth should improve through the second quarter of 2013, Nomura said. The brokerage forecasts that the Chinese economy would expand 8.1 percent, 8.8 percent, 6 percent and 8.2 percent respectively in the four quarters of 2013.\nHowever, this would also mean that inflation would return to 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 4.2 percent for 2013, after hitting a trough of 2.2 percent in June, according to the analysts. A new central government in Beijing to be installed at the end of the year may also sacrifice growth for long-term stability and reforms.\n\u201cAfter a decade of relatively fast GDP growth, overcapacity in multiple sectors, and rising income and wealth gaps, such reshuffling of the economy is necessary,\u201d Liu and Fung said. Beijing may set its 2013 GDP target at 7.5 percent, similar to 2012, they added.\nFor short-term trades, Nomura favors \u201ctactical\u201d stocks like Baidu, Cathay Pacific, CNOOC, Huaneng, Galaxy and ICBC, which are high beta stocks that it believes will rally until the first quarter of 2013, and may decline after.\nThe brokerage also recommends a list of so-called \u2018core\u2019 holdings, which investors should buy now and hold, including Geely, Want Want, China Life, Sino Biopharm, Zhaojin Mining, Beijing Enterprise and China Mobile. \u201cWe believe that these are the stocks worth accumulating on weakness,\u201d Nomura said.\nNomura believes Chinese stocks could rise again in 2014. Despite moderating GDP growth, China will not experience too much social instability, and at some point in 2014, there should be early signs of reform success. For example, the central government would have already taken action by then to recapitalize state banks if needed."}

After working as a director on several TV projects, she made the transition into film with her 1986 comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash, starring Whoopi Goldberg.\nET spoke with Marshall ahead of the film's release, where she opened up about the move from actress to filmmaker.\n\"I'd been approached to direct for many years now,\" Marshall shared. \"I didn't say, 'Choose me to direct.' They seemed to feel I could.\"\n\"I of course first took it as an insult that they didn't want me to act anymore, but that's just me,\" she added with a laugh.\nMarshall later admitted to ET at a special screening of the action comedy that she was \"nervous about an industry screening\" but added earnestly, \"I hope it goes well.\"\nThings certainly went well for Marshall's career after her directorial debut. Two years later, she was tapped to direct Tom Hanks in the 1988 comedy classic Big, which went on to earn two Academy Award nominations -- both for Hanks' performance and for Best Original Screenplay -- and universal critical acclaim.\n\"Some of it's Tom, some of it's me, some of it's written, some of it happened by magic,\" Marshall told ET in 1988, referring to the film's wild popularity. \"I think it's a collaborative effort, even though they say the director is in charge.\"\nWith Big, Marshall became the first female director to helm a film grossing over $100 million, and the pair re-teamed several years later for the 1992 baseball classic A League of Their Own, another commercial and critical success.\nMarshall continued directing and acting throughout her life, forging lasting friendships and lifelong bonds with the stars she appeared with on screen and those she directed.\nIn the wake of her death, due to complications from diabetes, there was a massive outpouring of tributes, memorials, condolences and memories shared by some of the biggest names in Hollywood whose lives were impacted by Marshall's kindness and friendship.

For starters, she said clients could motor their boats to her location, where their vessels would be hauled out of the water for any necessary services.\n\"The services rendered could be anything from bottom painting to any sort of mechanical work to work on the running gear,\" she said. \"We also offer a broad range of other services, including fiberglass and canvas work.\"\nIn addition to her 12 employees, Strassel said she teams up with a significant number of subcontractors to meet all of her customers' needs.\nOne of those subcontractors \u2014 Michael Lankton of East Naples \u2014 said Strassel breaks the mold in their line of work.\n\"It's rare to have a woman in her position, that's for sure, but Molly goes at it hard,\" said the fiberglass subcontractor who has worked with Strassel for the past five or six years. \"She knows everybody's name \u2014 and everybody knows her name \u2014 and she's just a hoot to be around. Just a great woman.\"\n\"She's just an awesome person,\" Michelle Lankton said of Strassel, whose business is also certified to perform warranty work on boats manufactured across the globe. \"She's a funny, outgoing, strong crazy woman \u2014 one who uses a pink travel lift to haul these big yachts out of the water. It's really something to see.\"\nTo go along with her litany of other services, including sailboat rigging and systems and safety inspections, Strassel also operates a full-service ship store and parts department at her location.\n\"It's a complete ship store, with engines and specialty parts to everyday cleaning supplies and everyday, miscellaneous boat parts,\" she said of the items on offer at her store. \"We're also able to order specialty items. So if you come in and I don't have what you need, I'll order it for you. Above all else, I pride myself on being a hands-on operator.\"\nStrassel said she owed a debt of gratitude to her former partner, Danny Commers, who passed away Nov. 27, for the ability to stay in Naples after Allied Marine closed up shop.\n\"We realized that if we worked in unison we could bring something to the Naples area that didn't previously exist, and that's an individually owned service yard that caters to manufacturers across the board,\" she said.\nMolly's Marine Services is open 7:30"}

But alas, what I thought was a feature of my column was for some its fatal flaw.\nI\u2019ve been writing about the inanity and jackassery of generational stereotyping and youth politics for literally 25 years, going all the way back to when I was a young twentysomething.

Regardless, seriously, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the Parkland kids or even the issue of gun control.\nLet\u2019s establish a baseline. I assume we can all agree that everyone is born remarkably dumb. Ever try to talk about the causes of the First World War with a newborn?

This is true of babies, who will cry about the silliest things (hence the word, \u201ccrybaby\u201d). But it\u2019s also true of teenagers.\nAgain, this is not string theory. We know these things. And the idea that I must provide empirical evidence for such a staggeringly obvious point is hilarious to me.\nAside from all the social science, medical science, novels, plays, poems, musicals, and movies that explore this fact, there is another source we can consult on this: ourselves.\nEvery not-currently-young person reading this \u201cnews\u201dletter has one thing in common: We were all young once.\nThis is what I mean when I say that \u201cyouth politics are the laziest form of identity politics.\u201d Say what you will for racial-identity politics, there\u2019s at least a superficial case that such identities are immutable.

We continue the proceedings with the team that owns the No. 13 overall pick in this year's draft, Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nWith their fourth selection in 1997, Tampa Bay struck gold. Barber is a five-time Pro-Bowler, and three-time All-Pro. He has started every game for the Buccaneers the past 13 seasons. His 47 career interceptions ranks fifth among active players.\nThe second part of undoubtedly the best draft class in Buccaneers history, the former Florida State linebacker started 221 of 224 games from 1995-2008.

Brooks was the 2002 NFL Defensive Player of the Year and an 11-time Pro-Bowler.\nThe anchor of Tampa Bay's defense for nine seasons, Sapp was the 1999 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, in which he totaled 16.5 sacks. Sapp -- a seven-time Pro Bowler -- anchored the defense that brought Tampa Bay its first Super Bowl in 2002, a 48-21 victory over the Oakland Raiders.\nA stalwart of the \"Tampa 2\" defense for 11 seasons, Lynch was a two-time All-Pro and nine-time Pro-Bowler. Throughout his career, he was known as being one of the hardest hitters in the NFL. While many think he'll eventually be enshrined in Canton, he's already in Cooperstown. Lynch, once a top pitching prospect, threw out the first pitch in the history of the Florida Marlins baseball team, and for that his jersey is now in baseball's hall of fame.\nThe giant left tackle from Wisconsin played in 183 games for Tampa Bay from 1988 through 1999, and started all 183.

O'Malley, who had criticized plans to deport many of the undocumented children, clashed with a senior White House official in a phone call after he asked some of the kids not be sent to a site in his state.\n\"What I said was that would not be the most inviting site in Maryland,\u201d O'Malley told CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. \u201cThere are already hundreds of kids already located throughout Maryland.\" O'Malley was referring to his phone conversation with White House Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz.\nO'Malley also told CNN he was open to housing them in other sites in the state.\nWhen you dems stop promoting and supporting the most wretched and vile sins in the Bible then try and pick the right verse to suit your needs and dont be a hypocrite ?

At the time, he was attending Fullerton Community College and she was at Cal State Fullerton. They have been married 10 years.\n\"We've always wanted to be parents. It's what I expected all along,\" Bruce Boyd said.\nBut because Renee Boyd can't lift anything over five pounds and because bearing a child also would place too great a physical strain on her, she said she is unable to have a child. So three years ago, the couple applied at the county agency.\n\"They said: 'You folks are handicapped. We have so many normal people we're dealing with, we don't have the time to match your special circumstances with the special circumstances of a child.' They politely told us goodby,\" Bruce Boyd said.\n\"It was extremely sad,\" he said, adding that the couple did not socialize for six months afterwards. \"We retreated. We thought maybe we were doing the wrong thing.\"\nEventually, they decided to start looking again and called various private agencies. But they could not find any older children, a requirement since Renee would not be able to lift even an infant or a small child.\nThe private agency works with other adoption agencies to find homes for children who have been passed over. Usually, they are older or physically, emotionally or mentally handicapped, according to Linda Howard, executive director of the Southern California branch, located in Irvine.\n\"We try to get the message out: There are children waiting for adoption. You don't have to be that elusive perfect family in order to adopt.

At this stage the object has not been identified. Senior regional investigator for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Peter Rowntree, said: \u201cNobody knows at this point. It happened so quick. We\u2019ve got our work cut out trying to figure out what this unidentified flying object was. What did they encounter? It definitely wasn\u2019t a bird. It was a fairly large object.\u201d He said it was up to three meters wide. The plane was about 55 kilometers from the airport when the incident happened. Some incorrect initial reports actually had the plane hitting the object.\nThe sudden evasive action by the plane to avoid the object caused two flight attendants who were busy clearing the cabin for landing to receive minor injuries in the incident. On landing, they were taken to the hospital but then released according to a statement from Porter.\nThere are increasing numbers of close calls between planes and drones around the globe, especially near airports. Earlier this year, British Airways pilots claimed their aircraft was hit by a drone while approaching London's Heathrow Airport in the U.K. A spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police said: \u201cIt transpired that an object, believed to be a drone, had struck the front of the aircraft.\u201d The Airbus A320 had 132 passengers and 5 crew members. The plane landed safely and engineers found no damage and cleared the plane to fly again.\nThe Trudeau government is working to pass new regulations as the number of drones being operated grows in the hope of preventing more incidents such as this one in the future."}

{"idx": "16014", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The S2110A runs Android 4.0.3 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" with some modifications from Lenovo. The biggest change you'll notice is Lenovo's home screen and transition animations. Instead of sliding between adjacent home screens, you get an animated cube. It gives the home screens a bit of a three-dimensional feel, but at the cost of smoothness and responsiveness. You can revert to the default animation, but even that is far too choppy for a tablet in this price range. The home screens are littered with custom Lenovo widgets, including a Lenovo App Store widget that I could not get to work.\nThere's a shortcut on the system bar that brings up five options for tweaking the tablet's settings. Preferences lets you change wallpapers and tweak both home screen animations and app transition animations. These are usually found in the stock Android settings menu, but can only be changed through Lenovo's Preferences shortcut on the S2110A. Manage Apps simply brings you to the Apps menu page in the Android settings. System Settings brings you to the Android settings menu. Add More Capacity is a bit misleading, as it simply brings up a menu of installed apps that you can add to your home screens or folder widgets. The last option is called One Touch Clear, which simply allows you to clear entire home screens in one fell swoop. Selecting it pops up a warning that reads \"Are you sure you want to clear all data on the current screen?\" which I thought was a bit confusing and ended up accidentally clearing all the preloaded apps and widgets from the main homescreen. There is no way to restore previous settings after a clear. All of these additions are pretty redundant, adding only a mildly easier and more convenient portal for home screen modification.\nThe IdeaTab S2110A is one of the few tablets powered by Qualcomm's dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor, as most competitors have opted for the quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 chip. It's not all about cores, however, and the S4 is a very fast and capable processor. In our benchmarks the S2110A was able to match, and in some cases exceed, its Tegra 3 counterparts in our browser and graphics tests.\nDespite the power of the S4, not everything was as smooth on the S2110A as I've seen in some Tegra 3-powered tablets. Home screen and app transition animations were often choppy and sometimes lagged for a split second too long. Gaming performance is a bit of a mixed bag. Frame rates in games like Riptide GP are smooth and gameplay is responsive, but some details appear jagged at the edges and textures look blander than on a Tegra 3 tablet. The difference may simply be on the software side, with a lot of these games optimized for Nvidia's chip, but that itself should be a concern for gamers, since many high-end Android games are optimized for the Tegra 3. The Transformer Pad TF300 runs on a lower clocked 1.2GHz Tegra 3 processor, but it felt snappier and smoother than the S2110A.\nMedia support was good, as the S2110A played back all of our test files.

Xuma together with his Secretary General, Rev James Calata, worked successfully during the 1940s to resurrect the ANC.\nOliver Tambo played a central role in this process, including as the first Secretary General of the ANC Youth League and later the Secretary General and Deputy President of the ANC.\nThe ANC resurrected in the 1940s became such a threat to our country\u2019s white minority regime that it was banned in 1960.\nAs all of us know, there followed a period of extreme repression imposed on our country by the apartheid regime, starting in the 1960s, such that towards the end of that decade the ANC was virtually wiped out as an organised revolutionary formation inside South Africa.\nAgain as we all know, exactly at the time of the banning of the ANC, its leadership sent its then Deputy President, Oliver Tambo, out of the country, to establish and lead what was described as the External Mission of the ANC.\nIn the end, as had happened during the 1940s, Oliver Tambo had to play a central role, this time as the leader, to help resurrect an ANC which, again"}

The largest breach in recent times came from SK, the firm behind Facebook-forerunner Cyworld, which is estimated to have had 35 million records nabbed in 2011.\nExperts are claiming that Korean IT policy \u2014 which has made the country reliant on Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explore browser and ActiveX software \u2014 a lack of spending of cyber security, excessive collection of user data and other factors have enabled these attacks and others in recent years.\nAn article from the Korea Herald explores the issue in detail, and includes the graphic below to illustrate Korea\u2019s security vulnerabilities.\nKorea may boast the world\u2019s speediest mobile Internet \u2014 thanks to the planet\u2019s first and second LTE-Advanced networks \u2014 but it is overly reliant on Internet Explorer and, in particular, ActiveX, which is used to power a key certificate system that verifies Internet users in the country for transactions.\nGoogle Chrome is widely considered to the Web\u2019s most popular browser \u2014 analytics site Statcounter pegs it at a dominant 40 percent market share \u2014 but many Korean websites run on Internet Explorer only. That\u2019s because ActiveX, which is not supported by Chrome, Opera or other browsers, is used as the identification platform to enable transactions over 300,000 won ($268).\nKorea\u2019s use of ActiveX isn\u2019t down to an infatuation with Microsoft, the software protects personal data and make it almost impossible for fraudulent transactions to take place.\nThe issue with ActiveX, however, aside from limiting the browser choice in Korea, is that it makes PCs and storage systems attractive and susceptible to hacking because it is storing valuable details. Each user\u2019s online \u2018key\u2019 is typically filed on their PC, motivating hackers to get their hands on the information.\nStatcounter data illustrates Korea\u2019s reliance on Internet Explorer.\nThe widespread use of ActiveX provides a target for hackers by storing information on networks and PCs, but it seems that a lack of preventative measures from companies is an equally significant factor.\nThe Herald cites data from KISA (Korea Internet Security Center) which says that some 73 percent of domestic companies spend no money on data protection because \u201cthere\u2019s no immediate return\u201d on their investment.\nKorea eased up on some of its online regulations last August when it ended a law that required websites to authenticate visitors by collecting their national ID numbers \u2014 something which provided even more \u2018hackable\u2019 data \u2014 while a law requiring the use of real names online was deemed unconstitutional just days later.\nA new bill aims to end the use of online certifications for Web-based purchases, but it isn\u2019t for certain that it will become law.\nWhile the abundance of digital records and lack of investment in security attracts hackers, the Korean government is not likely to transform the system until it finds another that keeps transactions as safe. The Herald says several companies are using ActiveX-free payment systems already, suggesting that change is possible for the future."}

Revenue may be VND26 trillion, compared with the target of VND26.8 trillion, he said.\nAsia's fastest inflation prompted the government to tighten credit this year and crimped demand. Vietnam's trade deficit, slowing economic growth and risks in the banking sector have also damped businesses and the government last week said gross domestic product may climb about 6 percent this year, slower than the 6.78 percent pace in 2010.\nStill, the economic environment presents FPT with opportunities to increase mergers and acquisitions, Anh said.\n\"The unfavorable economic situation is not good for business expansion but it is extremely good for M&A activity -- we can buy companies which we never thought we'd be able to,\"\u009d he said.\nThe Hanoi-based carrier will use part of its \"free cash\"\u009d of about VND3 trillion for acquisitions next year, Anh said.\n\"The current situation, when many companies are facing difficulties, is a good chance for us to take over companies either in the same industry or in other fields,\"\u009d he said.\nShares of FPT have declined 23 percent on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange this year, in line with the drop in the benchmark VN Index.\nFPT, which announced a cloud-computing alliance with Microsoft Corp. in May last year, is in talks with the Ministry of Finance and the State Capital Investment Corp. to increase its stake in FPT Telecom Co. to 100 percent from the current 43 percent, Anh said. The deal is likely to be completed as early as the first quarter, and FPT may issue shares for a swap as part of the transaction and pay the rest by cash, he said.\nFPT has also been in discussion with two local companies that publish weekly magazines, Anh said, without providing details. Companies operating in the digital content and education businesses are also likely targets, he said.\nMergers and acquisitions in industries ranging from coffee to medical services have increased in Vietnam this year as investors sought to profit from the country's growing middle class, even as inflation and borrowing costs increased.\nMasan Consumer Corp., a unit of Masan Group, agreed in April to sell a 10 percent stake to KKR & Co., the investment firm managed by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, for $159 million, Vietnam's largest private-equity investment.\nVinacafe Bien Hoa Joint-Stock Co., a unit of Vietnam's second-biggest coffee exporter, said Sept. 23 it accepted a takeover offer from Masan Consumer.\nFPT aims to boost both pretax profit and revenue about 25 percent next year as \"we forecast that the macro economy will still be volatile,\"\u009d Anh said.

Symbian is important to Nokia because the company is dependent on the sales of Symbian-based smartphones until it ships larger volumes of Windows Phones, which won't be until next year.\n\"The announcement underlines the difficulties Nokia is having when trying to convince consumers to buy Symbian-based phones, and that the company thinks Nokia is a stronger brand\" said Ben Wood, director of research at CCS Insight.\nConsumers bought 19.5 million Symbian-based smartphones during the third quarter, giving the OS a 17 percent market share.

But General Motors\u2019 announcement that the company was closing its Leeds Assembly plant in 1987 changed his life.\nWith the prospect that shutting down the 40-year-old plant would cost the city 4,600 jobs, the city asked the young intern to see if he could find a way to keep the plant open, even if it was a long shot.\nToday, Sproull is the president and chief executive officer of the Richardson Texas Economic Development Partnership, which brings together the stakeholders in the Dallas-Fort Worth region and is a leader in the economic development field. He is convinced that building the financial base of a community by expanding existing businesses and attracting new ones is a difficult but achievable goal.\nAs the nation\u2019s economy emerges from the worst recession since the Great Depression, governments are increasingly looking to their economic development operations, which come in many forms, to give them firmer financial footing as they try to rebuild service and functions that were slashed to balance budgets damaged by falling tax revenues.\nEven more importantly, economic development has emerged as a critical function that draws on all the resources and functions of government and, in many ways, is a bellwether of how well a government is delivering services to its business community. And, the way that economic development is organized within a government or a region tells a great deal about inter-government cooperation and the prospects for success.\nEven defining economic development is a real project. The International Economic Development Council (IEDC), a Washington group for economic development professionals, has prepared a 68-page reference guide that spells out everything anyone would want to know about economic development. It includes at least a dozen separate types of economic development, ranging from rural to downtown and small business to export and trade.\nRetaining and expanding existing business is included, and leaders often find that it\u2019s overlooked for the glossier initiatives when it can be the most effective means of growing an economy. Just as there is no silver bullet to succeed in development, there is no single definition for it, either.\nWhile communities are gearing up to attract and retain businesses, they are also becoming more aware of the need to consolidate their efforts among neighboring communities to be able to compete in a global economy. Today, regional initiatives are making themselves as known in Berlin and Singapore as in New York and Silicon Valley.\nLeaders in the economic development profession emphasize that the key to success in attracting and expanding the business base is taking a methodical, analytic approach, rather than what they call \u201csmokestack chasing.\u201d This is defined as landing new business through huge subsidies that may cost more than the new development can ever add to the community through jobs or new tax revenues.\nWhile economic incentives are part of the package that economic development operations consider, most leaders do not rank them among the most important parts of bringing in new business. Often, the incentives are tied to business commitments, and if the business does not fulfill its promises in areas such as sales taxes and new revenues, the negotiated tax rebates and other inducements are withdrawn.\nSproull, who is the current leader of the IEDC, considers his first instinct at his first challenge in Kansas City to be the correct approach.\nGerald Gordon, president and chief executive officer of the Economic Development Authority in Fairfax County, Va., agrees that it\u2019s essential for a community to determine"}

Yes.\nThe way the CCHD works continues to raise deep questions about Catholicism, evangelization and culture. Read especially Part II of Pope Benedict\u2019s 2009 encyclical God Is Love.

Thanks to technological advances in the last decade, businesses can now easily and cheaply take a high-resolution snapshot of a person\u2019s genomic variation at a fraction of the cost of sequencing the whole genome. Depending on the type of test employed, these snapshots can offer information about a person\u2019s ancestry and help identify genetic relatives. DNA can be used legitimately as a tool for genealogical and historical research, but there are also a lot of misleading and overhyped claims out there about what you can actually learn from your genome.\nThis is the first in a series of posts in which I\u2019m going to tackle some of the claims that commercial ancestry testing companies make. They\u2019ll help you distinguish between what's legitimate and what\u2019s \u201cgenetic astrology.\u201d We\u2019ll examine whether your DNA can actually tell you what sports you might be good at, what foods you ought to eat, and who you should date. But we\u2019ll begin this series with one of the most popular and important questions: Can your DNA connect you with your Viking, ancient Egyptian, or \u201cStone Age\u201d ancestors?\nEvolutionary forces shape our genomes, which reflect our ancestors\u2019 histories of migration and intermarriage with people from other groups. Completely sequencing our genomes, or characterizing thousands of DNA bases across the genome, can teach us a lot about that history.\nI want to highlight one testing service as an example of what I would consider genetic astrology. There are many others; I\u2019m only focusing on just one in order to illustrate the sorts of things consumers need to be mindful of while interpreting their genetic results.\nThis test is an attempt to address what is one of the biggest limitations in the claims of most ancestry tests currently on the market. Most companies compare your genome to those of living people from other populations across the world and then give you an estimate of which groups you are most similar to, giving rise to the common misconception that this is where your ancestors came from. But people living in a region today may not be genetically similar to those who lived there in the past. Ancient DNA analyses are the only way we can understand the genetic variation in a region at any given point in time.\nBut this, too, is a form of genetic astrology.\nDr. Graham Coop, a geneticist at UC Davis agreed: \u201cThis is a daft idea. Many of these ancient people the company uses are so far back in time that, if they left any living descendants today, we\u2019re all their descendants.\"\nThis point that Dr. Coop raised (and has blogged about) is one of the most important and counterintuitive facts about ancestry. Over generations, the cumulative effect of passing on only half of a genome from parent to child is that our DNA only represents a small, and rapidly diminishing (as we look further back in the past) fraction of our true ancestry. Most of your genealogical ancestors after about 9 generations didn\u2019t actually contribute much (if anything) of your genome. As you go back in time, you inherit less and less DNA from your ancestors and share more and more genetic ancestors with other people.\nIn addition, no population has ever stayed isolated for very long; our ancestors moved all over the place and so despite most people\u2019s belief that they have ancestors from just a few places, they actually have ancestry from people all over the world (see this post for an explanation). In fact, everyone alive today likely traces ancestry to a person who lived just "}

These exact strings pop up in a few other places, too, like the SystemUI and SetupWizard. The framework seems to be the main location, though. The framework also contains references for the new \"close\" and \"maximize\" buttons that a feature like this would require. The SystemUI gets in on the fun, too, with references to a \"recents freeform workspace\" (probably referencing the recent app list).\nThe feature would probably look a lot like Remix OS (pictured above)\u2014a third-party version of Android geared for desktop computers\u2014or the multi-window mode on Samsung phones.

Once apps have that down, it's a very short jump to a fully windowed operating system. In split screen, users can already arbitrarily change the horizontal size of an app\u2014a windowed OS would just add vertical resizing as well. Google would still have a ton of work to do with the System UI, but the app ecosystem is already quietly being asked to deal with this feature.\nThere's a fun symmetry here with last year's Android M Developer Preview, which contained a \"highly experimental\" split-screen mode.

His third request to be relocated was finally accepted at the end of 1944 and he was moved to the front, he said.\nGroening\u2019s trial was part of a renewed effort to target low-ranking Third Reich perpetrators. It followed the 2011 conviction of former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk. Some lawyers said the case set aside the traditional requirement that prosecutors had to prove that workers in camps had committed individual criminal acts before they could be held personally responsible for atrocities.\nThe Munich judges in Demjanjuk\u2019s trial said it was enough to show he served at the Sobibor death camp, in Poland, to convict him.

Increasing meat consumption coupled with growing per-capita disposable income in countries such as India and China are expected to have positive influence in regional demand. Europe is expected to witness below average growth rates of 4.4% from 2015 to 2022.\nAnimal feed application dominated the demand with an estimated market share of 52.5% in 2014. Lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan are majorly used as ingredients in animal feed additives for livestock production. Food & dietary supplements are likely to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% up to 2022.\nPlant source dominated the raw material segment and accounted for 86.0% of the demand in 2014. Animal based raw materials such as fish silage is expected to witness below average growth rates of 4.0% up to 2022 owing to ban on meat & bone meal in European regions.\nModerately consolidated amino acids industry consists of MNCs and local manufactures present are different levels in value chain.

Fantasy-relevant players are listed in order of rank in NHL.com's top 250. Today, we look at the Carolina Hurricanes.\nSebastian Aho, LW/RW -- The 20-year-old has a high fantasy ceiling for the Carolina Hurricanes and should be available outside the top 50 overall. He finished third in goals (24) and fifth in points (49) among rookies last season, and had strong peripherals (17 power-play points, 214 shots on goal). He was second among rookie forwards (minimum 75 games played) in Shot Attempts percentage (53.26) and could jump to 65-70 points in a top-line, first power-play role.\nJeff Skinner, LW -- He quietly finished among the NHL's top seven in goals (37, 6th) and shots on goal (281; 7th) and has shaken off the injury concerns from earlier in his career by playing 238 of a possible 246 games over the past three seasons. This is the best roster the Hurricanes have fielded in the Skinner era, so he's an appealing choice if available outside the top 75.\nElias Lindholm, C/RW -- He led the Hurricanes in assists per 60 minutes (1.56) last season and ranked 12th League-wide in primary assists (29) even though he missed 10 games. Lindholm, 22, is a relatively unknown name in fantasy circles but a prime sleeper candidate this season.\nTeuvo Teravainen, C/LW -- Tri-eligible in Yahoo last season, Teravainen had NHL career highs in goals (15), assists (27), points (42), power-play points (15) and shots on goal (169) playing mostly alongside Aho at even strength and on the Hurricanes' first power-play unit. They formed Carolina's best point pair (23 team goals with each having a point) and are only scratching the surface, so target them together hoping the Hurricanes leap into Stanley Cup Playoff contention.\nJustin Williams, RW -- The most notable forward addition this offseason is a familiar face in Williams, who will be 36 when the season starts, but averaged 50 points per season over his two-year tenure with the Washington Capitals. The best offensive seasons of his NHL career came during his previous time with the Hurricanes (2003-09), and he's always a threat to finish in the fantasy top 125 overall with sound category coverage.\nVictor Rask, C -- The Hurricanes are loaded with talent at wing, so this is a big opportunity for Rask and center Jordan Staal to return value as late-round fantasy picks. Rask saw a big dip in shooting percentage (8.6 last season; 13.1 in 2015-16) but barely regressed in points (45 last season; 48 in 2015-16). This should be his best season yet with at least 50 points in an even-strength spot with likely Skinner or Lindholm.\nJustin Faulk -- His career has been hindered by injuries and the inconsistent production that"}

He said the reduction would come on top of the 25 per cent cut the Liberal government introduced last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put more money in your pocket without shady accounting tricks,\u201d Mr. Ford said at a hotel in Kitchener, Ont.\nMr. Ford said his plan, which is nearly identical to the one former leader Patrick Brown unveiled last year, would cost the government about $800-million annually. The Conservatives would direct the province\u2019s share of dividends from Hydro One, the partly privatized utility, to reduce rates. The cost of energy conservation programs would be shifted from hydro bills to the government\u2019s books and the Tories would place a moratorium on new energy contracts.\nThe dividends currently go into general revenue, and Mr. Ford did not say how the Tories would replace the money.\nThe announcement comes nearly a year after Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2019s government put forward its plan to cut hydro rates by a quarter. Dubbed the Fair Hydro Plan, the policy was introduced after electricity bills had nearly doubled over the previous decade, causing widespread anger in the province. Ontario\u2019s Financial Accountability Office has said the plan could cost $45-billion over the next three decades.\nMr. Ford said on Thursday that he would call an independent inquiry to probe government spending after a report from Ontario\u2019s Auditor-General highlighted several issues with the way the province has accounted for the Fair Hydro Plan. While Mr. Ford repeatedly called the report\u2019s conclusions on the Liberal government\u2019s hydro plan a \u201cscandal,\u201d on Friday he said his hydro cut would be built on top of the rate deduction from the existing policy.\nColin Nekolaichuk, a spokesman for the Ministry of Energy, said Mr. Ford\u2019s decision to support the Liberal government\u2019s energy policy was a welcome move. However, he said Mr. Ford\u2019s previous commitment to fire Hydro One\u2019s chief executive and replace the utility\u2019s board was the creating uncertainty in the electricity sector. Mr. Ford said he was reacting to the large salaries paid to executives at the former Crown corporation.\n\u201cDoug Ford\u2019s plans don\u2019t add up to anything but empty promises that will eventually dig their way into people\u2019s pockets,\u201d Mr. Nekolaichuk said.\nTodd Smith, the PC Party\u2019s energy critic, said it could be difficult to cancel the government\u2019s \u201cconvoluted\u201d hydro plan.\nNew Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said she would scrap the Fair Hydro Plan and bring Hydro One back into public hands. Her party has pledged to reduce bills by 30 per cent overall.\nWhy is Doug Ford giving Kathleen Wynne a chance to invoke Donald Trump?"}

Both nights featured just a couple of newbies alongside seasoned KROQ bands, but for our money, night two seemed a more digestible, less dated and altogether stronger bill, even without U2 headlining as originally scheduled.\nNo Doubt\u2019s closing set punctuated this point. Not only were Gwen Stefani and the boys formidable replacements for U2 \u2014 as a local band who first got airplay on KROQ, in many ways they made more sense.\nDressed in bedazzled holiday garb and rocking a pink-dipped new wave 'do, Stefani commanded the stage like the pop diva she has become, plowing through the band\u2019s catchiest hits (\u201cHella Good\u201d \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d \u201cSpider Web,\u201d \u201cUnderneath It All\u201d) and inspiring sing-alongs of \u201cSimple Kind of Life\u201d (dedicated to hubby Gavin Rossdale, whom she met at a KROQ Xmas show) and the band\u2019s breakthrough, \u201cI\u2019m Just a Girl.\u201d She implored the gals \u2014 and strangely, the guys \u2014 in the crowd to sing along to the mega-hit in groups, after noting that she was the only female singer on the two-night bill.\nWe noticed the lack of female acts and frontwomen this year, too (which would've been even worse, if U2 hadn't canceled), and we were hoping Stefani would offer some inspirational words to would-be girl-rockers in the crowd, and issue a direct challenge to KROQ to do a better job of showcasing female artists. Instead, her statement came off as being about all about her and a little arrogant. It was The Voice judge\u2019s only misstep.\nThere were some smaller estrogen-powered moments on stage Sunday, by the way.

As fans of their infectious \u201cFloat On,\u201d we found the rest of their material less buoyant.\nWeezer also delivered all the goods \u2014 a tight arsenal of hits, starting with the driving \u201cHashpipe\u201d and \u201cPork and Beans,\u201d closing with their older faves including \u201cUndone - The Sweater Song\u201d and \u201cBuddy Holly.\u201d They also played a new one from their latest album called \u201cGo Away,\u201d a duet that had Rivers Cuomo bring out the only other fronting female of the eve, Best Coast\u2019s Bethany Cosentino.

They plan a second round of tax cuts before the vote in November.\n\"By virtue of being Republicans, we are born to cut taxes,\" said Rep. David Dreier (R) of California, at a GOP rally before Wednesday's vote.\nExtending the tax cuts first enacted in 2003 had been a top priority for the White House in President Bush's second term. It took nearly a year for House and Senate negotiators to agree on the bill. And although the final product falls short of his request to make the changes permanent, it does give Republicans a rare boost in a year marked by party division and rancor.\n\"When in trouble, you fall back on the tried and true, and for Republicans, tax cuts are the tried and true,\" says Norman Ornstein, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nAt the same time, House Republicans propose raising the debt limit to nearly $10 trillion - its fifth hike in the Bush years. When they took back the House in 1994, the debt limit was $4.9 trillion.\n\"The trouble for Republicans is they are going to be forced to increase the debt limit again, having just done it [in March], and this time to an embarrassingly large $10 trillion,\" Mr. Ornstein adds. \"It's hard to argue that these tax cuts will cut the deficits, when they have had to raise the debt limit so many times.\"\nThe soaring national debt, some $2 trillion of which is in foreign hands, troubles lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. \"If you want to explain how much our national debt is, it's handing out a $100 bill on a street corner every second of every day for 2,500 years,\" said Sen. Christopher Dodd (D) of Connecticut, speaking in opposition to the tax bill on the floor of the Senate Thursday.\n\"I'm not for raising the debt limit. I can't in good conscience do it,\" says Rep. Joel Hefley (R) of Colorado, who nonetheless voted with all but two of his GOP colleagues for the tax bill in the House on Wednesday. The bill passed the House by a 244-185 vote. Only 15 Democrats supported it.\nThe budget agreement for FY 2006 provides for $106 billion in tax relief over the next five years, including $70 billion that can be shielded from a Senate filibuster through the reconciliation process. The fight over which tax cuts should have protected status held up agreement on the tax bill for months.\nHouse negotiators, led by Rep.

Like many others in our community, I have an interest in how our city operates and the direction it\u2019s taken. Prior to first being elected alderman in Ward 1 four years ago, our neighborhood faced unacceptable issues. We re-established the Oakland Neighborhood Watch Association, where I was elected president. We initiated programs designed to bring neighbors together, improve safety and awareness to reduce crime and due to our many successes, I was asked to run for alderman. I did and won against an opponent that had been unable to address our concerns.

Fellow alderman Ken Kinsella and I work well together. We get things done with little delay. It\u2019s important to work together, which benefits our ward in ways that divided can never accomplish. I hope for the opportunity to continue my service to Belleville\u2019s ward 1 residents and businesses.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your town? How would you approach it? Economic development, growing our community is one very important concern for Belleville. We must continue to look for ways to strengthen our local businesses, improve communication and develop areas in and around Belleville to encourage investment into the future strength of our community. The health of our city depends on safe neighborhoods, job and career opportunities, entertainment choices and attractive recreational areas. These attributes among others help make our community a great place to live. I will continue to help make Belleville a safer and more rewarding place to live, work and raise our kids.\nUnder what circumstances, if any, would you raise taxes or fees in the municipality? Please explain. I am a resident of Belleville. I live here, I work here and I certainly pay taxes here. No tax increase or fee increase is ever taken lightly and can only be considered necessary when all other efforts or options have been exhausted. I will always oppose any tax increase or fee increase that I do not believe is absolutely necessary. My record shows I have opposed past fee increases, and the last tax increase passed by our council was mandated by the state to fund pension obligations for our police and firefighters.\nCrime has been an issue in parts of the metro-east. What is the best way to stop the problem in and around your community? Safety in our community is definitely an important issue to each of us. We must always look for ways to make our city and neighborhoods safer. Community policing is an effective policy that increases communication between citizens and our police. Awareness and communication helps us remain safe. But also we must continue to staff and equip our police department appropriately. I serve on the Police and Fire Committee, where we continue to discuss and implement ways to improve our police department\u2019s capabilities. Our police department has a newly expanded, modern facility and we have recently added six new police officers, with others beginning the process. I also support creating an auxiliary police unit that will help add manpower to our department, freeing up our officers and providing more safety during events.\nIn recent years, the city has granted various tax incentives to businesses. Explain whether you would support or oppose tax incentives for businesses. Instances exist where I would not support tax incentives to businesses. I certainly would not be in favor of any incentive where the citizens, the taxpayers of Belleville do not benefit from the investment. I would only support very limited incentives as an investment to encourage development or improvements that foster growth of Belleville\u2019s existing businesses or the creation of future economic opportunities. Growth is fundamental to the health of our community. I will"}

By 2001 the company had begun building its own modern factory on the outskirts of Geneva to accommodate the prolific and creative horology and new movements stamped with the prestigious Seal of Geneva \u2013 a quality certification only very few watch companies can boast having on any of their movements, much less the entire production.\nRoger Dubuis was acquired by leading luxury group Richemont in 2008, after which the collections were downsized to provide customers with a more focused line of unique watches. While ladies\u2019 watches never disappeared from the Roger Dubuis collection, they certainly did not have the same technical and inspired design focus they previously had \u2013 until 2016.\nThis past year has been the declared year of women at Roger Dubuis \u2013 and if you think these new timepieces are your regular \u201cfemale fare,\u201d please have a look at this gallery of the brand\u2019s 2016 products. These are interesting watches in visual, technical, and mechanical senses (even if the \u201cdiva\u201d marketing used in connection with the watches aimed at women is perhaps a tad overplayed; the idea is to relay to prospective female consumers that \u201cthey are spectacular\u201d).\nBut the standout is certainly the most technical of them: the Black Velvet Paraiba. This beautiful timepiece is housed in a speckled carbon fiber case, the construction of which is anything but usual. To achieve this look, Roger Dubuis\u2019s technicians and case maker begin with a non-directional random fiber sheet that is layered and then machined using diamond-coated tools. The dial is crafted using the same technique. As special and beautiful as that is if you like extremely lightweight, black watches, it\u2019s still not even close to the incredible technical feat that setting 66 Paraiba tourmaline gemstones into this material is. This is naturally a world first in watchmaking: mechanically setting incredibly rare and beautifully sourced gemstones of this magnitude into a carbon material that is nearly impossible to work once it is cured. There is no other way to describe this: it is a difficult yet delicate task that hardly another watch brand would have dared to even attempt. For more technical information and loads of beautiful and original photography, please see Carbon Cases: A Lesson In Differences With Roger Dubuis\u2019s Black Velvet Paraiba And Excalibur Skeleton Carbon.\nThe Black Velvet Paraiba, limited to just 88 pieces, is powered by Roger Dubuis\u2019s own automatic Caliber RD821; it retails for $59,300.

Public officials must report gifts of $250 or more on their statements of financial interest filed annually. There is also the state's conflict of interest law that bars public officials from accepting gifts for personal enrichment. And it is illegal for them to accept a bribe in return for a promised action.\nSpokespeople for the Senate Republican and Democratic caucuses say the gift ban legislation is expected to draw broad support from their members.\nSenate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, R-Delaware County, stands in full support of this proposal and his spokesman Erik Arneson said the Republican leader would like to see votes taken on it soon after it is introduced.\nA similar proposal is being advanced on the other side of the aisle in the Senate as well. Sen. Daylin Leach, D-Montgomery County, is seeking support for legislation that bars lawmakers from taking cash as personal gifts and goes one step further by prohibiting cash campaign contributions above $50.\n\"I understand that if a gift exceeds the limit, it must be disclosed,\" Leach said. \"However, the nature of cash makes it much more difficult to detect a failure to disclose such as was alleged in the recent investigation.\"\nEarlier on Monday, Sen. Randy Vulakovich, R-Allegheny County, announced his bill that proposed a different type of government reform that like the gift ban, also has sat idle in recent years.\nHe wants to require lawmakers to turn in receipts to collect reimbursement for work-related expenses, instead of just claiming unvouchered per-diem payments that require no receipt.\nWhile this idea has been a topic of general discussion, it is likely to get more attention now that a specific proposal has been introduced, Arneson said. He added many senators, including Pileggi, do not take per diems. That number seems to grow every session, he said.\nVulakovich, a former police officer, said he gets tired of hearing people say that all legislators are guilty of doing the type of unscrupulous acts that have put some lawmakers and legislative staffers in jail and made others targets of investigation.\nHe said he ran in 2006 on a government reform agenda and has tried to be rel"}

I wonder if it might go into the post-show adventures of Bob, the show\u2019s demonic antagonist. Frank Silva, who played the character, died in 1995, so Bob won\u2019t return in his familiar form when the show goes back on the air.

This has long been a dream project of mine that will bring a whole other aspect of the world of Twin Peaks to life, for old fans and new. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled.\nThere are already two primary official Twin Peaks novels.

Now Google\u2019s DeepMind is taking on the multiplayer space-war videogame StarCraft II. No one expects the robot to win anytime soon. But when it does, it will be a far greater achievement than DeepMind\u2019s conquest of Go\u2014and not just because StarCraft is a professional e-sport watched by fans for millions of hours each month.\nDeepMind and Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind StarCraft, just released the tools to let AI researchers create bots capable of competing in a galactic war against humans. The bots will see and do all all the things human players can do, and nothing more. They will not enjoy an unfair advantage.\nDeepMind and Blizzard also are opening a cache of data from 65,000 past StarCraft II games that will likely be vital to the development of these bots, and say the trove will grow by around half a million games each month. DeepMind applied machine-learning techniques to Go matchups to develop its champion-beating Go bot, AlphaGo. A new DeepMind paper includes early results from feeding StarCraft data to its learning software, and shows it is a long way from mastering the game. And Google is not the only big company getting more serious about StarCraft. Late Monday, Facebook released its own collection of data from 65,000 human-on-human games of the original StarCraft to help bot builders.\nResearchers have built bots for the original version of StarCraft for years, using an unofficial, open-source plugin. Churchill says those bots so far are mediocre players that rely mostly on tactics coded by their designers, rather than machine learning, to build up their own grasp of the game.\nDeclaring war on StarCraft provides a measure of the ambition at Google and Facebook\u2014and the limitations of today\u2019s smartest software. StarCraft is a real-time strategy game in which players command an alien army in a distant corner of the Milky Way. While the game may appear less daunting than Go or chess, it poses a greater challenge to AI.\nIn chess and Go, you can see all your opponent\u2019s moves and pieces, making them so-called perfect information games. StarCraft is an imperfect information game. You cannot see all of your opponents\u2019 troop deployments or construction projects, forcing you to use what you\u2019ve seen, and your mental model of the game, to predict what they may be planning.\nBeating StarCraft will require numerous breakthroughs. And simply pointing current machine-learning algorithms at the new tranches of past games to copy humans won\u2019t be enough. Computers will need to develop styles of play tuned to their own strengths, for example in multi-tasking, says Martin Rooijackers, creator of leading automated StarCraft player LetaBot. \u201cThe way that a bot plays StarCraft is different from how a human plays it,\u201d he says. After all, the Wright brothers didn\u2019t get machines to fly by copying birds.\nChurchill guesses it will be five years before a StarCraft bot can beat a human. He also notes that many experts predicted a similar timeframe for Go\u2014right before AlphaGo burst onto the scene."}

Despite spreading faster, hyperswarms were less able to stick together to form dangerous biofilms.\nThe change was down to a single mutation in their DNA that allowed the bacteria to develop several whip-like flagella for movement instead of just one (Cell Reports, doi.org/nhm).\nThe results suggest that therapies encouraging the bacteria to mutate into a hyperswarming form could make them less harmful.\nOUR galactic zoo evolved into recognisable species a mere 2.5 billion years after the big bang.\nToday, disc or spiral galaxies are mostly blue, a sign that they are forming new stars, while blobby spheroidal galaxies are red and are no longer making many stars.\nTo see how far back this pattern existed, Mauro Giavalisco of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and colleagues looked at pictures of massive galaxies taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The team focused on an early era when star formation was at its peak. They found the same familiar breakdown of shapes and colours in more than 1000 massive galaxies (The Astrophysical Journal, doi.org/nhv).\nThe results will help cosmologists sort out which of the processes that go into galaxy building are the most important for defining cosmic structure over time.\nCOULD a blood test predict whether a person is at risk of committing suicide?

And Reemo\u2014a combination wristband, receiver, and nothing else\u2014is pretty damn close to nailing it.\nWhile existing home automation systems can do just about anything and everything without you ever leaving your couch, there's a relatively high barrier to entry in terms of tech-savvy. In other words, the people who actually need the benefits of home automation (i.e. the elderly) are also the people least likely to be able to use it.\nReemo, on the other hand, is so delightfully simple that age isn't an issue. Whether you're young or old, it's just plain cool.\nReemo is a wristband and a set of small black receivers that you pair with devices around your home\u2014from lamps to thermostats to TVs. There's no tearing down walls, no complicated tricks to learn. There's not even an app. There's just one simple step that connects your appliances to Reemo's wristband: You point at it from up to 100 feet away, then make one of six motions that Reemo recognizes.\nFor example, you can set your Reemo up to turn on your lamp by rotating your wrist.\nThen, you simply move your arm using that gesture and bam\u2014light goes on.\nIt'll control pretty much anything that runs on electricity.. It could be a thermostat, or an Xfinity home automation system, your TV, or even replacing your keyboard and mouse. It has a 9-axis IMU that lets you do motion tracking so it could actually be a real time mouse. So you can click on icons, move things, adjust them, draw\u2014whatever you want to do.\nAll of which sounds neat, sure. But more than just a fancy toy, Reemo also wants to provide a necessary service. Since, at least initially, the device will be targeted towards people in home-care situations, it will be able to tell when the user is interacting in their home and how. Which means peace of mind for the caretakers, who can access that information from afar.\nBut the beauty of Reemo is that it has the potential to be just as effective at handling more complicated tasks as it does simpler ones. This is a system that boils all user interaction down to a few, simple movements. Its brilliance is in its simplicity. It's easy to imagine how other companies could apply it to their own products\u2014after all, the accompanying bracelet leaves plenty of room open to activity tracking.\nAs with other existing home automation systems, outfitting your house with Reemo won't come cheap. A starter kit, which includes a band and multiple sensors, will run you between $200 and $250 when Reemo launches its Indiegogo campaign in August. But it's already in talks with a few companies hoping to operate on its technology. Which, hey, is more than we could ever say for The Clapper."}

But at what point did our lives become so pressured and busy that we began to collectively accept the normalcy of forgetting our children's presence?\nGiving tips on ways to remember a child in the backseat is helpful, but the substantive issues remain unaddressed. When will we start engaging in conversations that shine some light on the very real risks of trying to parent in the fast-paced and stressful environment that has become the norm in family life?\nHow could any parent be so absorbed in his career as to not have had at some time during the day the horrendous realization that he'd left his baby son alone in a car at a BART station?\nObviously, the child didn't enter his head. The terror and physical agony suffered by that tiny boy is beyond sickening.\nI wonder why so many people have children only to discard them at day care centers at an age when they should be nurtured by their mothers in their homes. No career or salary justifies child neglect by \"sleep-deprived\" parents.\nThe story is troubling enough, but the prospect of prosecuting the parent is even more so.\nWhat, exactly, is the point? To what vengeful god do we pay homage? The mere thought of such a thing is shamefully inhumane. It is of a piece with our prison \"industry\" and voyeuristic crime reality shows.\n-- Parents are urged to put \"something important\" into the backseat of their car (purse, briefcase, etc.) to remember that their child (implied \"not important\") is in the car seat.\n-- If both parents are going back to work within four months of having a baby, how much really are they going to interact with the child anyway? Two hours a night, at most?\n-- At the end of The Chronicle article, there is the implication that the father should not be prosecuted because of this: \"Why would we punish him any more if he's going to live with this for the rest of his life?\" That implies that if a person kills someone else while driving drunk, we should not prosecute them if they know they have to live with the thought that their actions caused the death of someone else.\nSo, Cardinal William Levada, former San Francisco archbishop, claims that allowing gay or lesbian couples to adopt children \"would actually mean doing violence to these children\" (\"Catholic group likens city policy to Nazi plan,\" June 10).\nWhere in God's name does he get that?\nI have never seen a report or claim that gays or lesbians abuse their adopted children.\nHowever, I have seen the Ryan Report ( www.childabusecommission.com/rpt) that details the long history of physical and sexual abuse of children by clergy of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. The report echoes claims of abuse of children throughout the church.\nThe hierarchy of today's church has become an embarrassment with no moral authority.

Photo by Veronica Weber.\nThe good news is that a long-awaited response to recommendations made eight months ago by a \"select\" committee of elected officials appointed by local Members of Congress suggest an acknowledgment by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the South Bay's air traffic noise problems are real and can't be ignored.\nThe bad news is that the FAA says little can change for at least two more years because of the agency's drawn-out processes for modifying current practices.\nWith the FAA under attack by President Donald Trump, it remains to be seen whether real change is in the offing or if the response is just a way to get the local congressional delegation and critics off the agency's back.\nThe report, which makes City of Palo Alto staff reports seem poetic by comparison, exhibits little effort to communicate in plain English, is filled with jargon inaccessible to even the most informed reader and reflects the intensely bureaucratic nature of the FAA. Its 10 pages of text and 39 pages of \"response\" tables read more like an interagency technical memo than a document written for public consumption.\nMuch is nearly impossible to decipher, such as this typical paragraph: \"In accordance with the Phase One document (see the FAA's Phase One Report 2.a.ii), 99 percent of aircraft flying the STTIK departures are within 1NM of the SSTIK waypoint, as per the procedure. Without ATC intervention, pilots are flying the SSTIK procedure as designed. NCT will continue to reinforce no intervening with aircraft until after the SSTIK waypoint to personnel through training and briefings.\"\nIn many cases, the FAA's response to the select committee's recommendations states that solutions lie with more training and briefings of air traffic controllers rather than revisions to formal rules, but the agency wouldn't agree to implement noise measurement practices that could create greater accountability for achieving improved results from these trainings.\nNevertheless, the response document in its entirety amounts to significant progress, in theory.\nThe FAA said it will move forward with changing the arrival flight path to San Francisco Airport from the south over the Santa Cruz mountains back to one more similar to what was in place historically and at higher altitudes.\nIt says it has already made changes to reduce the number of late-night flights crossing populated areas and will develop new rules that move these approaches over the bay as much as possible.\nPerhaps of most benefit to Palo Alto residents, the FAA says it will look at ways to disperse arrivals bound for SFO so that fewer plans are funneled over a major navigational \"waypoint\" located above and south of the intersection of Willow Road and U.S. Highway 101. It said, however, that increasing the minimum altitude for flights at that waypoint to 5,000 or more feet was \"not feasible.\"\nBut the big question is whether any of these seemingly positive developments will actually get implemented given the upheaval in progress at the FAA. The five-year term of the current Obama-appointed FAA Administrator, Michael Huerta, whom Rep. Anna Eshoo and other local congresspersons have tried for years to influence, will expire in January.

Therefore, the measures that were taken against the State of Qatar is an act of aggression and is relating to other reasons, not Iran, he added.\nHE the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that shutting down Al Jazeera is out of the question, stressing that any demand that affect the sovereignty of the State of Qatar will not be discussed.\nOn a previous statement by HH the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani that the concept of terrorism may differ in the State of Qatar from some other countries, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani stressed that Qatar remains committed to this position saying that the government recognizes a group as terrorist if it is designated by the UN Security Council or if there is proof it has committed violence.\nHE explained that the current political leadership of the movement is in Gaza and some of its leaders in the State of Qatar who came to participate in negotiations of the national reconciliation in which Qatar plays the role of mediator.

The Muslim Brotherhood is a political group that are working in countries such as Bahrain which is one of the siege countries, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said adding that this is a double standard that one of the demands is to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group at a time when the Bahraini parliament includes members of this group.\nRegarding Al Nusra Front in which the State of Qatar helped to release a US journalist held in custody, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani stressed that dealing with Al Nusra Front or other does not mean our support for its ideas and regarding this issue, we only played a mediator role in facilitating dialogue with them and we have no direct communication with them.\nOn the role of US President Donald Trump and his administration in this crisis, HE the Foreign Minister said that the US-Qatari relations are very strong and the American administration plays a major role in solving the crisis as it tries to resolve"}

Together, the executive, the House, and the Senate developed a spending plan, essentially intact after the governor\u2019s partial vetoes, that prioritizes those issues most important to New Mexicans and effectively addresses the concerns of the lawsuit that successfully challenged the adequacy of New Mexico schools.\nSpecifically, spending for the state\u2019s public colleges is up 4.3 percent, and the Corrections Department will see an increase of 4.9 percent. A 7.1 percent increase for the Health Department primarily will be used to provide services to more New Mexicans with developmentally disabilities, including infants and toddlers. The 10.4 percent increase for the Children, Youth and Families Department will allow for the expansion of child protective services and prekindergarten.\nWith that funding and a companion education reform bill, spending will nearly double for students at risk of failing because of income, English proficiency or transience; schools will have the option of adding, and receiving funding for, 10 more school days to the regular school year, after-school programs, and the successful summer program known as K-5 Plus; and all school employees will see pay increases of at least 6 percent, with an estimated 5 percent more for teachers at schools that extend learning time and 14 percent more for teachers at schools that provide K-5 Plus. In addition, new \u2014 higher \u2014minimum salaries for teachers, counselors, and principals will mean those who, after the 6 percent raise, still fall short of those minimums will see even larger increases.\nBeyond the reforms required by the Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit that resulted in the finding that New Mexico schools are inadequate and fail at-risk students in particular, research shows the best school systems in the world have strong early childhood systems, highly skilled, well-compensated teachers, and robust career and technical education options all together in a well-integrated system that serve children from birth to college, or career-readiness. Along with legislation addressing multiculturalism and career and technical education, the state budget and the education reform bills will move New Mexico dramatically forward on building a world-class education system.\nImportantly, these increases are well within New Mexico\u2019s means. With all spending and revenue bills accounted for, New Mexico will have an estimated $1.44 billion in in its general fund reserve, an amount equal to 20 percent of planned spending and well within the cushion economists say will allow the state to weather an economic downturn.\nRep. Patricia Lundstrom, executive director of the Greater Gallup Economic Development Corporation, has served in the New Mexico Legislature representing McKinley and San Juan counties since January 2001.

As it was corralled, Shenault tumbled forward for a few yards before crossing the goal line for the 40-yard touchdown.\nIn a triumph over UCLA two weeks ago, Shenault lined up in the backfield, where he was used as the quarterback in a Wildcat formation, and darted to his left, rushing for a 1-yard touchdown.\nAs USC prepares to face unbeaten, 19th-ranked Colorado on Saturday, it must prepare for Shenault, a multi-talented receiver who is one of the breakout stars in the college football this fall.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see him at all the positions,\u201d Trojans defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said, noting Shenault has lined up at outside receiver, slot receiver, tight end and as a \u201cWildcat\u201d quarterback.\nThe versatility presents the biggest threat for the Trojans. Shenault is the nation\u2019s leading receiver with 51 catches for 708 yards and six touchdowns and has also run for four touchdowns in only 13 carries. Shenault had all four of Colorado\u2019s touchdowns in a 28-21 victory over Arizona State last week, catching two scoring tosses from Montez and running for two scores.\nHelton gushed about Shenault\u2019s effort when he was lined up as the \u201cWildcat\u201d quarterback, moments that are obvious running situations.\n\u201cEverybody in the park knows he\u2019s running it,\u201d Helton said.\nUSC\u2019s opponents this season have rarely used the \u201cWildcat\u201d formation, which features a running back or receiver as the quarterback. In Shenault, Colorado has a 6-foot-2, 220-pound receiver who can carry the ball in its package. As part of their preparation, the Trojans have spent additional practice time working on red-zone and goal-line situations.\nThe success has been sudden for Shenault, a sophomore. He caught only seven passes as a freshman a year ago, a total that he surpassed in the second quarter of the first game this season.

(Nasdaq:BWEN) reported revenue of $38.2 million for the third quarter of 2010, up 4% from the second quarter of 2010. Versus the third quarter of 2009, revenues declined 36% from $59.5 million primarily due to lower tower production, reduced deployment of service technicians and lower hauling activity linked to the overall decline in the U.S. wind industry. According to the American Wind Energy Association, capacity additions during the third quarter of 2010 totaled 395 megawatts, 75% below the comparable 2009 period.\nThe net loss for the third quarter was $8.3 million or $0.08 per share, versus a $4.9 million loss ($0.05 per share) in the third quarter of 2009. The increased loss reflected the impact of lower revenues partially offset by the beneficial impact of an 11% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost-containment efforts in the weak environment.\nBroadwind CEO J. Cameron Drecoll stated, \"During the third quarter, we continued to improve our financial results quarter-over-quarter. With projected Q4 revenues approaching $50 million, we will end the year with strong results and an improved cash position. More importantly, we will enter 2011 with excellent capacity utilization in our operational tower plants, improved gearing operations and a broader service offering.\"\nDrecoll continued, \"We continue to make progress on our strategic and operational initiatives, focused on improving our capacity utilization and transitioning to a leaner cost structure. Our Abilene, Texas-based wind turbine drivetrain service center remains on track to come online at year end. We continue to believe that Broadwind will be well prepared to meet customer demand as the industry regains momentum.\"\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 totaled $97.0 million, down 41% from $164.9 million in the prior year-to-date period, reflecting weak industry demand, which impacted the Company, particularly in the first half of the year. The nine- month 2010 net loss totaled $36.6 million or $0.35 per basic and diluted share, versus a net loss of $17.5 million or $0.18 per share in the first nine months of 2009. Absent the impact of one-time acquisition-related items, including a $5.1 million one-time gain associated with an escrow settlement in 2009 and a $4.6 million charge in 2010 associated with the impairment of goodwill related to a 2008 acquisition, the nine month net loss for 2010 totaled $32.0 million or $0.30 per share, a decrease of $0.07 per share when compared to a net loss of $22.6 million or $0.23 per share in the prior year.\nDuring the third quarter, the Company added $27 million, or approximately 71% of revenue, in new business to its backlog. At September 30, 2010, backlog totaled $210 million, down modestly from $221 million at June 30, 2010.\n"}

And these shot fireballs at me. So I found cover behind a rock to wait out the projectile attack, and I forgot about the spiders.\nActually, you know what? Time out. Let's stop for a second. This is obviously the first part of a story about virtual reality. It's the part that describes the thing I'm doing in VR as though I'm really doing it. And I write a little bit about doing the virtual thing, the simulacrum, and you think Oh, man, that sounds like a fun experience, but then I say Aha, but NO! THIS WAS VIRTUAL REALITY! and we all breathe deep the promise of immersive technology and wonder how our puny brains will handle it. Maybe that thing I'm doing is standing on the edge of a building, or ascending The Wall, driving a racecar, flying like a bird (or Iron Man), or wandering a beach, or being swarmed by alien spiders while distracted by fireballs and then dying an ignominious death of spider bites before I can take out the enemy's energy core.\nBut every time I do this thing where I describe the thing I'm doing in VR as though I'm really doing it, here's what I'm doing in meatspace: Nothing. I'm standing. Maybe I'm crouching. I'm probably holding a game controller and pushing an analog stick or a button.

I can turn the gun this way and that IRL, and it twists accordingly in VR; I can hold it up to my face IRL, and peer through the scope in VR to squeeze off a remarkably accurate shot.

{"idx": "16136", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As recently reported in the DNJ, the Rutherford County Republican Party is seeking to have state law changed to introduce partisan elections to the Rutherford County School Board, the Murfreesboro City School Board, the Murfreesboro City Council, the Smyrna Town Council, the La Vergne Board of Aldermen, and the Eagleville City Council. This would involve a change to the charters of these governing entities. This request has been made by letter from GOP Chairwoman Donna Barrett to Rutherford County\u2019s delegation in the state legislature.\nBarrett\u2019s stated reasoning is the \u201cissue of rights\u201d of a candidate to state their party affiliation. \u201cThe voters deserve to know the core values and the governing principals (sic) of a candidate,\u201d the letter is quoted as saying. While on the surface this may seem harmless or even beneficial to informing voters, the issue deserves careful examination. In a local election, voters expect that a candidate be free to express their personal values and ideas. As current politics demonstrates, national party platforms do not always reflect local issues and experience.\nReduced or conflicted priorities regarding local needs and goals. These local governing bodies are working well under the existing system, where elected officials are free to debate issues and vote their conscience without any expectation of adhering to party principles or platforms that may not align with an official\u2019s knowledge base and experience concerning local needs and goals.\nLess informed voters. Conscientious voters want to judge candidates not only on core values, but their leadership qualities, experience and positions on local issues. Labeling local candidates with party affiliation threatens to reduce this decision to a single letter and therefore a less informed choice.\nReduced voter influence or engagement. Partisan elections will push more candidates into primaries, which tend to amplify party influence, including fundraising, and which historically have less voter engagement.\nImpacts on election procedure which demand further exploration. Imposing partisan primaries on the at-large governing bodies in our cities and county would undoubtedly change election procedures; for example, candidates might have to run for a particular seat, even though these bodies are not subject to a districting system. Implementation options vary. If citizens are truly interested in partisan local elections, we strongly urge a detailed study and public discourse on how the election process would change.\nHere in Rutherford County in the last election cycle, Republican candidates in contested legislative races universally declined or ignored the League\u2019s invitation to participate in candidate forums. The assumption that a party label frees a candidate from discussing the issues is therefore established in our community. We believe this attitude completely defies the definition of \u2018public servant\u2019 and unfortunately suggests a party serving itself much more than democracy as a whole. No matter which party might take such action, the League would be gravely concerned.\nOur local government will function best if it stays focused on local issues and above the debilitating fray of national party politics. Use http://www.capitol.tn.gov/legislators to contact your legislators today and tell them to keep local elections non-partisan.\nKory Wells and Bonnie Black serve as co-presidents of the League of Women Voters of Murfreesboro/Rutherford County. A nonpartisan political organization, the League encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.

Some albums aren't merely slapped-together assortments of songs but rather cohesive works.\nFrom the earliest days of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s up through the early 1960s, kids bought \"45s.\"\nThe albums of the period typically had just a few good tunes, and the rest was crap. Then The Beatles changed the rules. Their albums were so chock-full of great stuff, you wanted to hear every tune. Sure, singles were still important, but most of the bands that mattered didn't rely on singles, and even The Beatles stopped putting out singles tied to a specific album (there were no singles released from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).\nI agree with one thing in Mark Cuban's \"The Album is Dead\" post--that the major labels and music business have a lot to answer for--but rushing to embrace the commoditization of music won't create an environment for artists to thrive.\nCuban's musings--\"Consumers are buying music one track at a time. I think people will pay 99 cents to get a single rather than steal it. I think people would rather steal a full album rather than pay 10 dollars or more for it.\"-- may turn out to be true, but ultimately, we'll all be the poorer for it.\nYou oldsters may remember that in the '60s, albums sold for $3 to $5, which is a lot more than $20 in 2008 dollars. No one was whining that music was too expensive 40 years ago, and movie ticket prices in the '60s were $1 to $2.\nIf you applied the same pricing ratio to movie ticket/albums prices, CDs would be closer to $30 today. The ever-escalating price inflation of baseball, football, basketball, and Broadway show tickets are now many multiples of CD prices.\nFor some reason, people no longer want to pay for recorded music, but millions of Led Zeppelin fans would have happily paid big bucks for tickets for their recent London show.\n\"The Album is Dead\" mantra surely isn't true yet. Witness Radiohead's In Rainbows and the Magnetic Fields' Distortion: these albums aren't merely slapped-together assortments of songs; no, they're cohesive works.\nMark Cuban is a businessman. He clearly knows how to make a buck, but if he was a big shot in the music business in 1966, The Beach Boys would have stuck with singles and never made Pet Sounds.\nThe \"album,\" a collection of songs, goes back decades before the LP, to when multidisc sets of 78rpm records were popular. The discs were inserted in \"pages\" of the album, hence the name.\nSure, the LP vinyl record and CD are still referred to as albums, but according to Wikipedia, the album is almost 100 years old.

Charlie Baker.\nThis week Baker, a Republican who supports abortion rights, celebrated the signing of a bill approving $8 million to offset the potential loss of federal funding to women's reproductive health organizations under a new Trump administration rule. That rule, dubbed a \"gag rule\" by critics, would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals or sharing office space with abortion providers.\nNo sooner had Baker praised efforts by lawmakers to close any funding gap in the Title X program than he was asked about another bill aimed at expanding access to abortion.\nThe bill - called the \"ROE Act\" by supporters - would allow women to obtain an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases of \"fatal fetal anomalies.\" State law currently allows abortions after 24 weeks only if needed to preserve the life or health of the mother. The bill would also eliminate the requirement that teenagers obtain permission from a parent or judge before obtaining an abortion.\nMassachusetts GOP Party Chairman Jim Lyons criticized what he called \"the radical Democrats in the House and Senate supporting infanticide.\"\n\"The extreme infanticide bill removes all practical limitations on aborting unborn babies. These abortions are frequently referred to as late-term or partial-birth abortions,\" Lyons said in a statement.\nLyons also opposed allowing teens to obtain an abortion without the permission of a parent of judge.\n\"Can it really be that a decision by someone under 18 to have an abortion is less significant or traumatizing than smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, or visiting a tanning salon?\" Lyons said.\nAlthough Baker said he opposes late-term abortions and supports current abortion laws in Massachusetts, he said he wasn't comfortable with incendiary political rhetoric and tried to distance himself from Lyons' words.\n\"I don't believe in questioning motive, I don't believe in questioning character, and I think the inflated language that exists on all sides in politics has made it much harder for people to do the work that they're supposed to do on behalf of the people they serve,\" Baker told reporters.\nDemocrats also bristled at Lyons' comments.\n\"Just like Donald Trump, Massachusetts Republicans are using lies and fear-mongering in an effort to deny women the fundamental right to access health care and make their own reproductive health decisions,\" state Democratic Party Chairman Gus Bickford said in a statement.\nRebecca Hart Holder, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts, disagreed with Baker, saying current state abortion laws don't provide enough protections.\n\"Today, Massachusetts women facing a lethal fetal diagnosis later in pregnancy must travel out-of-state and pay exorbitant costs to receive later abortion care, away from their home, their families, and their support systems,\" Holder said in a statement.\nThe Senate and House versions of the bill were filed by Sen.

That may not sound like much, considering that Harvey's career so far consists of just 17 starts and 108.2 innings. But it was very nearly the game of any pitcher's career. As SNY announcer Ron Darling put it, \"I've seen a couple of perfect games that weren't pitched with this kind of perfection.\"\nMaking his seventh start of the season for the New York Mets, Harvey allowed nothing more than a scratch infield single to Alex Rios with two outs in the seventh inning. He struck out 12. He wasn't around in the 10th inning when the Mets won the game 1-0, but by that time much of the Mets fan base wasn't either.\nWhen the Mets trotted out reliever Bobby Parnell in the 10th inning, the crowd seemed to dwindle by half, and the Mets probably also lost a significant portion of their TV audience. Recently the New York Daily News' Bob Raissman noted that \"when Harvey takes to the mound, the Mets are averaging 2.49 household rating, 14 percent higher than the team's average of 2.19. Harvey is also outpacing the team's average rating in two key demographics (adults 25-54 and men 25-54), the demos advertisers rely on when deciding whether to purchase commercial time.\" In other words, among the audiences the Mets most want to reach, when Harvey's on the mound ratings go up 35 percent. Or rather, they were up 35 percent\u2014that was before Harvey's near-perfect game.\nTuesday's performance cements Harvey's status as the most promising young player in baseball. A pitcher who has shown what Harvey has shown in 12 decisions seems almost inevitably destined to be great. What's more, he's not just a Mets franchise player\u2014he's practically the franchise. His story stands as an example of the way that teams should, but too often don't, groom up-and-coming pitchers: by letting them pitch.\nHarvey's rise couldn't come at a better time for his team. The Mets have been having a bad month in what looks to be a bad season in a bad decade of a bad half-century. Though they should have virtually the same resources to draw upon as their crosstown rivals the Yankees, they have won just four pennants and two World Series from their first season, 1962, through last year. Following the Wilpon family's near-disastrous association with Bernie Madoff, the franchise has pared itself down more than ever. Their All-Star third baseman David Wright and Harvey are just about the only players celebrity Mets fans Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart, and Bill Maher\u2014and the rest of the Mets diehards\u2014have to root for.\nThis is quite a burden for a young pitcher who just turned 24 and won only seven games (against five losses).

The first Kindle was readable in sunlight; it also offered long battery life and allowed you to look up words on the fly, as well as to take notes and highlight passages at will.\nThe Kindle 2 retains all of those capabilities, in a slimmer form (it's 0.36 inch thin). I appreciated the thinner profile: The new device felt better in my hands, and I could see that it would be easier to pack alongside the other devices in my gear bag. At just 10.2 ounces, the device's weight is virtually the same as before.\nThe 600-by-800-resolution screen is the same size, measuring 6 inches; but now, packing the latest E-Ink technology, it gives you 16 shades of gray versus the 4 shades available on the original Kindle.\nAside from the screen, the Kindle 2 packs a slew of design changes. The power switch moves to a more convenient location at the top of the unit (previously it was on the back--an awful place for a power switch). But the handy wireless off switch, which was also on the back of the first Kindle, is gone entirely; now you must turn off the wireless radio in the Home menu (annoying for us frequent flyers who will do so far too often). The volume buttons are no longer on the bottom of the device; instead, the rocker switch is at the right spine.\nThe navigation keys have been completely redone, too. At left are Previous and Next buttons, with the former half the length of the latter; at right are a Home button and another Next button. The Next button ran the length of my thumb, and it was comfortably situated in relation to where my hands rested while holding the device at its midsection.\nI can't say the same, unfortunately, about the new five-way navigation joystick. In my brief hands-on, the joystick felt stiff and awkwardly placed relative to where my hand was for the paging buttons. The scroll wheel moved much more smoothly; I've used other joystick designs that operate more smoothly than the one on the Kindle 2.\nAs for the menu interface, though, I preferred the new device's approach: No longer do you have an awkward column on the right of the screen, with a sliver of silver denoting which line you're about to select. Now, the E-Ink screen technology's speed is fast enough to enable the joystick to move through options directly on the screen, highlighting your selection as you go along. Huge improvement.\nThe keyboard has been completely redesigned, to more closely resemble what you find on a cell phone with a QWERTY keyboard. I found the circular keys easy to press and incredibly handy.

But don't plan on picking up your shiny new manufactured liver just yet.\nLet's just say it's a good thing this breakthrough didn't come around when I was in my early twenties, or I may have been tempted to spend a little more time at my favorite neighborhood watering hole.\nScientists at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center say they've successfully used human liver cells to create miniature livers that function like their larger, more naturally derived counterparts.\nUsing a process called decellularization, the team rinsed real livers from an unspecified animal with detergent, stripping them of all their cells and leaving only a collagen-based structure behind. They then introduced two types of cells--immature human liver cells and endothelial cells that line blood vessels--via a system of tiny vessels in the liver. The livers were then placed in a bioreactor that flooded them with nutrients and oxygen. After a week had passed, the team saw that new, functional liver tissue had grown within that biological \"scaffolding.\"\nDespite the success of the project, the researchers were quick to caution that their work is a long way from making its way into any sort of human treatment. For one thing, the manufactured livers have only been tested in the lab. Whether they'll function as well when transplanted into an animal's body is yet to be seen. There is also the challenge of making a similar organ large enough for human use.\n\"We are excited about the possibilities this research represents, but must stress that we're at an early stage and many technical hurdles must be overcome before it could benefit patients,\" said Shay Soker, professor of regenerative medicine and the project's director. \"Not only must we learn how to grow billions of liver cells at one time in order to engineer livers large enough for patients, but we must determine whether these organs are safe to use in patients.\"\nStill, the news is encouraging. And while it's not the first time organ tissue has been manufactured in a lab, it is the first time a functional human liver has been created, according to the team's statement.

His refusal had angered the plan's Gulf sponsors who, along with many in the international community, fear that a collapse of political order in Yemen could pave the way for groups linked to al-Qaeda to overrun the country.\nThe GCC plan, proposed last spring, calls on Saleh to step down as president of Yemen and hand over all constitutional authorities to the vice president. In exchange, Saleh would receive amnesty from prosecution for himself and his family.\nIn recent weeks, the United Nations intervened to break the political deadlock and proposed a \"road map\" for implementing the Gulf initiative, but its efforts failed.\nWidespread anti-government protests have swept Yemen since January, triggering rampant chaos and violence throughout the country. In the southern provinces, fighters linked to al-Qaeda have seized control of three towns.\nFighting raged on Monday for the Abyan provincial capital of Zinjibar, where government troops have been trying to dislodge insurgents who have held the area for nearly four months, residents and a security official told the AFP news agency.\nAlso Monday, armed men have killed Lieutenant Colonel Ali Ahmed Abd Rabbo, a senior Yemeni intelligence officer in the main city of Aden, the latest in a spate of assassinations to hit the south, according to a security official.\n"}

She is now married, with a child and her dedication is a bit torn with all of that.\nBirthing a child racks the body and it showed at times, even with the success she had.\nWill she be able to turn the corner and get back into the kind of shape she needs to be in to dominate with more than a great serve and much more limited movement overall?\nIf she can she\u2019ll win a couple more majors, if not all the stars will have to line up in her favor.\nShe wants to win at least one more major to tie Margaret Court Smith record of 24 and two to become touted the greatest women tennis player ever to date.\nRafa has pulled out of the Australian, so for him it\u2019s his health.

Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, who aptly fits into all the opinions of the above-quoted great minds.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, particularly in the case of non-Nigerians who may be reading this, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi is a Nigerian politician from Rivers State, a South-South State in Nigeria; a recipient of the national award of Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON). He was the first Nigerian to be the Speaker of a State House of Assembly for a whopping eight years and later became Chairman of the Conference of Speakers Forum, an umbrella body of all Speakers of State Houses of Assembly in Nigeria. He has been the Governor of Rivers State these past six years plus and currently the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum. His unprecedented feats in the transformation of Rivers State have won him many international and local awards, as well as the respect of great leaders both locally and internationally.\nIn the politics of Nigeria, apart from Alh. Atiku Abubakar (GCON), former Vice President, who utilised his knowledge of the power and impact of the Judiciary to exert his office in the hands of the very powerful President, General Olusegun Obasanjo who had wanted to remove him from office by any means as the then Vice-president of Nigeria, no other Nigerian politician can boast of using the Judiciary to the fullest to achieve his political mission like Rt. Hon. Governor Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers State. To some schools of thought, Governor Amaechi is the creation of the judiciary and that is the main thrust of this attempt to unravel what role the judiciary may have played in the political struggles of this enigma of Nigerian politics.\nIn one of his public outings, Governor Amaechi stated that his politics is that of struggle and not an easy path. This is not only a truism but a statement of fact as his politics is riddled with struggles since he started real politicking from 1999.\nUniversity of Port Harcourt in Rivers State was where Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi laid the foundation of his political life, participating actively in student union politics, especially in the National Union of Rivers State Students (NURSS) of which he was President, and the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS). He cut his teeth in politics as Secretary of the now defunct National Republican Convention (NRC) in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State between 1992-1994.

Even after Independence, the most prominent ideologue of the RSS, Guru Golwalkar, declared Muslims and Christians as \u2018Internal Threats\u2019 number ONE and TWO respectively (Bunch of Thoughts, p. 177). RSS, its leaders and cadres always propagated the theory that Hindus were at perpetual war with these two minorities specially Muslims. It was reiterated recently by none other than a senior RSS leader and current Governor of Tripura, Tathagata Roy who in a tweet wrote, \u201cThe Hindu-Muslim problem won\u2019t b solved without a Civil War\u201d. He claimed that it was from the diary dated January 10, 1946 of the Hindutva icon, Syama Prasad Mookerjee. It may be noted that Mookerjee closely worked with the Muslim League in serving the British rule and was deputy CM in the Muslim League ministry of Bengal in 1942 when Congress was banned. Tathagata\u2019s digging up of the above quote shows that he believes in its relevance today.\nThe recent brazen unhindered violence at Baduria and adjoining Basirhat in West Bengal\u2019s North 24 Parganas district, perpetrated by the marauding Muslim mobs targeting common Hindus while protesting against an objectionable post denigrating Islam, its Prophet and holy place by a teenager Hindu of the area proves that apart from the protagonists of Hindutva politics there are criminal elements among Muslims who want Tathagata Roy to be proved right.\nThis violence targeting innocent Hindus not only weakens the democratic-secular narrative against rising Hindutva violence against Muslims, Christians and Dalits but provides RSS another opportunity to pose as defender of the \u2018persecuted\u2019 Hindus. This fact cannot be ignored that whenever mobs inspired by Hindutva politics attacked the whole of the Muslim community for any \u2018crime\u2019 of a Muslim individual or group like massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 as revenge for burning of train coaches at Godhra, the same was hugely condemned. Whenever, Muslim localities and properties were attacked as revenge against some objectionable posts by some Muslims or latter targetted for some Muslim carrying \u2018beef\u2019, the public opinion generally decried such engineered violence.\nThis area has no history of violence between Hindus and Muslims, not even in pre-Partition days. The present violence is the outcome of tussle for supremacy between a Muslim \u2018strongman\u2019 who is patronized by TMC and a Hindu \u2018strongman\u2019 backed by BJP/RSS. Both of them present themselves as saviours of their respective communities. The saddest part was the criminal attitude of the law and order machinery of the area. The controversial FB posting had gone viral three days prior to the attacks on Hindus. Police and higher district officials remained mute spectators to this. It seems as if they were waiting for this kind of flare up so that polarization is complete.\nMuslim mobs which roamed freely attacking Hindus and destroying their properties for couple of days claimed that they were doing it for saving the honour of Islam. The honour of Islam seemed to be so shallow and vulnerable that a FB post would destroy it. This is height of hypocrisy.

Now, it wants to conquer the family hauler.\nTesla's Model X - one of the only all-electric SUVs on the market - was officially unveiled Tuesday night near the company's California factory. SUVs were delivered to the first six buyers.\nCEO Elon Musk says the Model X sets a new bar for automotive engineering, with unique features like rear falcon-wing doors, which open upward, and a driver's door that opens on approach and closes itself when the driver is inside.\n\"All these things together make the car amazing,'' he said.\nThe Model X is the third vehicle from 12-year-old Tesla, after the Roadster - which was discontinued in 2012 - and the Model S sedan. It should attract new customers - particularly women - to the brand, and it goes on sale as the market for luxury SUVs is booming. U.S. luxury SUV sales were up 17 percent through August, five times better than the industry as a whole.\n\"If Tesla's going to be a more significant player, they need more products, and SUVs are what the market is demanding,'' said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car buying site AutoTrader.com. Musk said Tesla expects about half of its sales to be SUVs.\nBut there are drawbacks. Only a fraction of the sippy-cup set will be able to afford the Model X, even with a $7,500 federal tax credit. A fully loaded performance model is $142,000; exact pricing of the base model hasn't been released, but Musk said the Model X will cost $5,000 more than an equivalent Model S, or around $93,000. Musk said the company will eventually offer a less expensive variant with a smaller battery.\nThe Model X shares a platform and motor with the Model S, which is made at the same factory. But unlike the S, which has several battery options, the X only has a 90 kilowatt-hour battery and only comes with all-wheel drive. The 90D version will go 257 miles on a full charge, while the P90D performance version will go 250 miles. Tesla's high-speed ``ludicrous mode'' is offered on the P90D; it goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds.\nThe Model X has three rows and seats seven; on a test ride, the back row could fit an adult and had a surprising amount of headroom. The front windshield, which Tesla says is the biggest in the industry, sweeps back and over the front seats. Navigation, music and cabin controls are accessed through a 17-inch dashboard touch screen.\nBut the most eye-popping feature is the double-hinged falcon-wing doors. They need less than a foot of clearance to open, and they're fitted with sensors so they won't trap hands or hit cars parked next to them.\nThe doors - and the Tesla-designed second-row seats, which all move independently - were among the reasons the Model X's launch was delayed several times. Musk announced plans for the Model X in 2012; it was initially expected to go on sale in early 2014.\nMusk says the company ``got a little carried away'' and might have designed the Model X differently if it had known the final engineering"}

A lot of that would have been easier if I had known about 3D scanning and all that stuff. Then in 2012, I left my job because I wanted to start a company. I was trying to meet as many people as possible. I went to a party where I was preaching the 3D printing gospel again. Someone told me, hey you should go talk to this guy back there he\u2019s a 3D guy. So I went to Cedric who is now my co-founder and CTO. He had never heard about 3D printing. But he told me, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this prototype around 3D. If you are interested I\u2019d be happy to talk more. Let\u2019s have lunch.\u201d So we agreed to have lunch the next day. Then he showed me what was essentially the first web-based 3D player to have ever been built. He had been a 3D programmer in the video game industry for 15 years and was hired by Mozilla to make the first demo of WebGL for the launch of Firefox 4 back in 2011. He built the first WebGL framework\u200a\u2014\u200aso WebGL is now standard but wasn\u2019t standard back then to display 3D graphics in the browser. He showed me the prototype which was really just an upload button, you uploaded a 3D file and got back a URL and saw the 3D file in your web page.

A command post was set up to coordinate an all-city response, school buses lined up to transport hundreds of volunteer residents for sand-bagging, businesses helped with dump trucks carrying sand, major rescue operations began in areas where residents were stranded, certain roads were closed to public. All other plans were put on hold. A massive mobilization effort saved our downtown during that flood.\nA child runs toward a busy street, grown-ups see the urgency and act. In this case, public officials perceived the emergency based on science and evidence \u2014 National Weather Service data, a vast network of monitoring stations, satellite and radar data, rainfall data, river gauges, and flood forecast modelling \u2014 and acted to protect public safety. There was no arguing, no dithering. Action based on robust evidence.\nNow, imagine if at that time a well-financed group ran many ads on radio, TV and newspapers all over the region, and had published opinion pieces in local papers and had placed guest experts on radio talk shows, floating stories that we don\u2019t know for sure if a flood is coming, saying let\u2019s not overreact, and that all this talk of floods is a hoax. Imagine if they suggested that we really did not need the National Weather Service, because it was too much government. What would happen if public officials fell for such falsehoods instead of acting based on evidence?\nSimilarly, for the past many decades, global agribusiness agents in Iowa have been working hard to make sure Iowa\u2019s public officials and residents do not perceive and do not act on the urgency of polluted streams, the urgency of soil erosion and contaminated drinking water, or the urgency of Iowans' well-being compromised by massive animal confinement operations, or by annual spraying of 35 million pounds of corn and bean pesticides.\nThey are working hard to tell Iowans that all is well, that we do not need a strong Department of Natural Resources, or investment in Iowa\u2019s soil and water protection. And yet, through math, ecology and health sciences, we have robust and overwhelming evidence of these realities, meaning Iowans are in danger \u2014 much like the flood data that compelled Cedar Falls officials to perceive the emergency of the flood and act immediately.\nState officials whose duty it is to protect Iowans are not perceiving Iowa\u2019s situation as urgent, so devastation continues, even when we know a better Iowa is possible. If a foreign power had caused so much destruction in our state, we would send in the Marines.\nBut what if we did see land-degradation as an emergency, pivotal to our economy and the future of our state? I imagine a command post set up immediately for coordinating a massive mobilizing operation in Iowa. It would likely involve ecologists, hydrologists, land owners, farmers, cities, counties, public health officials and others to develop and enact policies that would incentivize and implement the best of what we already know from long-term robust scientific findings: more 4-5 year crop rotation, integration of crop and livestock, more deep-rooting perennials, more biodiversity, more and wider stream buffers, much less corn"}

{"idx": "16173", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Nearly a decade ago I had the privilege of co-editing a book alongside Dr. David Hesselgrave called MissionShift: Global Mission Issues in the Third Millennium. It was an honor to co-labor on a project with a man who had been so influential not only to me, but to so many in the field of missiology. David set the stage for many rising missiologists to understand cultures and to contextualize each in a way that honors God and others.\nAlthough David has passed away, his legacy will, without a doubt, live on for generations to come.\nAs I reflect on his legacy and influence, I believe that, in a sense, he could be considered the Dean of Evangelical Missiology. Having served as Professor of Missions at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (in fact even helping to build out the Missions Department to make it a world-class seminary) and co-founded (with Donald McGavran) the Evangelical Missiological Society, his impact reached far and wide into the academic and missional-practitioner world.\nIf you are an evangelical missiologist, you have been influenced by David Hesselgrave.\nAnd as author of numerous articles and books, including Communicating Christ Cross-Culturally, Planting Churches Cross-Culturally, and Paradigms in Conflict: 10 Key Questions in Missions Today, David was a thought-leader in every sense of the term. Look over the curriculum in almost any Missions Department here in North America and beyond and you will likely find David Hesselgrave\u2019s works still as foundational texts in courses.\nNearly every serious missiologist I know today is indebted to David\u2019s courageous and cutting-edge deep dive into how to engage cultures well.\nDavid was a tireless advocate for deep theological grounding of evangelism, contextualization, communication, and of being an adept student of culture. He exemplified the integration of faith and learning\u2014bringing his social science training to missiology with theological precision and penetrating insights. I offer my thanks to God for David\u2019s life and witness, which I first experienced as he mentored me while I served as his teaching assistant and, later, as his friend and colleague.\nBeyond his understanding of culture and his commitment to the integration of faith and learning, David was also what I would call a \u201cprioritist\u201d when it came to people hearing the gospel message. When we worked on Mission Shift, he modeled to me what it looked like to stand against the growing Evangelical consensus that mission would also include, even equally prioritize, societal transformation.\n[We are traveling] a path at least similar to our ecumenical counterparts of the past century. We gradually subtract what is unappealing from the gospel and add so much that is appealing to both gospel and mission that we end up with a socio-politial (holistic) gospel and mission. Witness the Cape Town Commitment. It does end but is \"to be continued\"-- there really is no end to the good things we can love, think, say and do in the name of \"Christian mission.\"\nHis deepest priority was to see men and women respond to the good news of the gospel. In all his works, he placed evangelism in our Evangelical missions endeavor as essential to who we are and what we do today.\nI'm deeply thankful for him.\nBorn in a small town in Wisconsin, David came to faith when his brother, who was on his death bed, came to faith. His brother recovered and both he"}

Fencing stretching a dozen city blocks. Heavy machinery \u2014 drilling, digging, dumping and pouring concrete. All in view of their front yards.\nThe work is winding down, with only five months left on the $250 million reconstruction of the old CSX railroad tunnel beneath their street of colorful rowhouses and brick apartment buildings. But residents fear their agony over one of the District\u2019s most contentious construction projects won\u2019t end there. Beyond the annoyance of the dirt and noise, many are reporting increased vibrations in their homes every time a train passes through the new structure.\nA city review of CSX Transportation\u2019s vibration monitoring confirmed the residents\u2019 concerns that train operations may be causing more powerful vibrations than projected by pre-construction estimates. CSX says its monitoring shows vibration levels are compliant with what was laid out in a federal report as acceptable.\n\u201cCSX installed sophisticated monitoring devices along the Project limits to ensure that the construction activities performed comply with the permitted vibration levels,\u201d the company said in a statement, saying it has continually notified residents and businesses about high noise- and vibration-producing activities.\nCSX demolished the century-old tunnel beneath Virginia Avenue SE, from Second to 11th streets, and built twin tunnels in its place. The first of the two tunnels \u2014 which were built closer to the residences \u2014 opened for business more than a year ago and for the first time allow the passage of double-stacked rail cars through the city, increasing the capacity for freight transportation in the corridor. Crews completed the second tunnel this spring, pouring more than 84,000 cubic yards of concrete as they finished the tunnel\u2019s roof and have shifted their efforts to track work with a goal to have it open this summer.\nCSX says the completed project will end a choke point created when trains passing through the tunnel were forced to merge from two tracks to one, slowing the movement of freight up and down the East Coast.\n\u201cAs planned and as it was conceived, it will allow the trains to continue to keep moving, which helps with the fluidity of the trains,\u201d said Chuck Gullakson, assistant chief engineer and project manager.\nThe project is on schedule for completion in October, he said.\nThat timeline delights residents eager to see the fences and heavy machinery go and their sidewalks, courtyard and curbside parking return. Yet it also worries those who fear train speeds, now 25 mph inside the tunnel, will increase when the work is complete.\nA main freight line requires minimum speeds of 40 mph, federal documents related to the project say. The new tunnels were constructed to accommodate trains traveling up to 40 mph, and the speed permitted immediately outside the tunnel is 40 mph, nearly twice the speed allowed inside. Residents say that speed combined with heavier trains passing through in a tunnel closer to their homes is producing more intense rattling.\n\u201cI\u2019ve repeatedly watched water dance in a bottle as trains pass by, my television remote bounce about on my bookshelf,\u201d said Maureen Cohen Harrington, another resident just steps from the tunnel.\nThe District Department of Transportation launched an investigation last year into claims that trains passing through the new tunnel \u2014 and not construction activity \u2014 are the source of the more powerful vibrations.

They put the women and children near the bank of the river, and they put the men in a different place on the beach. Some of the men were seated, others were trying to run away in fear. They were being slaughtered, killed with shovels and the army was also shooting them and killing them with sharp weapons.\u2026 They dug a big hole and then also used the natural holes in the beach to put bodies in, and then they burned them with gasoline. I saw them slide the bodies in.\nNo one else came out of that house. They all burned to death inside.\nBetween 7 and 10 soldiers took us to a room in a house. I could hear women and girls screaming from the other rooms. They first took my child and threw him down on the ground. He was still alive then, and I had to watch as they slaughtered him. The children of the other two women were killed the same way. A few minutes later, they took the bodies of the children and threw them on a fire outside.\nThen the soldiers raped all three of us women. I was on my back [being raped] for an hour. It was four or five soldiers.\u2026 They beat us all until we were half dead, and then they set the house on fire. I saw that one of the corners of the bamboo wall had a hole in it. I made it bigger by kicking it, and I escaped from the house. No one else came out of that house. They all burned to death inside.\nAbout 10 soldiers took us away [to a house].\u2026 If they found children alive, they shot them or beat them to death. When we first entered, we couldn\u2019t even really enter the room because of the number of bodies already there, there were so many.\nOne of the soldiers had a big wooden stick, and he hit me on the head and knocked me semi-unconscious. Then they were hitting the children. They stripped us naked, searching for our valuables. It is all blurry, but I remember them beating my 10-year-old sister-in-law \u2013 they hit her in the head with a big stick. Her face was swelling up and she was just screaming loudly in pain. Then she was just breathing loudly, and then she was barely breathing. And then she died.\nThe house was already on fire when I woke up. I saw another woman on fire. She tried to stand up, but she fell down again. Burning objects were falling on us from the roof. So I stood up and stepped over the bodies of the others, and broke the [bamboo] wall with my leg and escaped. The other woman burned to death inside. Only I managed to escape, no one else came out alive from the house.\nI tried to go back to get the bodies of my children, but they were already on fire.\nAll four of my children were with me. I was holding them.

Just as the effects of the strengthening economy in Brazil can be seen in Argentina, the effects of a credit downgrade in Greece or Ireland can be felt in the US. Within one nation, these inter-market relationships are especially important.\nStocks & Bonds: On a day to day basis, investors constantly make the same decision; stocks or bonds? Each and every investor evaluates market and economic conditions, and places their capital in the investment vehicle that appears to offer the best return for the risk taken, ultimately driven by the two most powerful emotions; fear and greed. When times are good with high levels of employment, strong corporate earnings, and rising consumer prices, stocks tend to rise. Monies are withdrawn from savings accounts with the hopes of capturing superior returns as innovation leads equity markets to new lofty heights. Bonds fall out of favor and are forced to offer higher yields in order to compete with the euphoric effects of new 52-week highs only stocks can provide. In the glorious days of 2007\u2019 as the Dow (Dow Jones Industrial Average) approached 14,000 the U.S. 10-year treasury bonds offered yields in excess of 5.00%.\nConversely as stock prices suffered extensive losses reaching multi-decade lows in 2008\u2019, feelings of greed quickly shifted to fear as the Dow touched lows below 7,000, the 10-year bond yields sank to levels nearly touching the 2.00% threshold. As bond yields rise, the actual price of the bond falls as the cost to pay this yield makes the bond less valuable, which is demonstrated in the following example: An investor purchases a Treasury bond offering a 3% yield, issued at $1,000 parity. The economy, stocks, and bond (yields) subsequently rise. New bond issues that now offer 5%, make those 3% bonds less attractive and therefore less valuable in the eyes of the investor.\nStocks & the Dollar: The USD and Dow have enjoyed positive and negative correlations, at times moving in the same or opposite directions. Over the past few years under a low interest rate environment an opposite or negative correlation has persisted. As the USD tends to move under the anticipation of higher or lower interest rates, positive economic data leads the \u2018market\u2019 to believe the FED (Federal Reserve) is more likely to raise interest rates, and it is therefore logical to expect USD strength. The opposite also holds true; negative economic data may lead investors to believe the FED is less likely to raise rates or perhaps even lower borrowing costs which in turn may result in a weaker USD.\nHowever as interest rates are lowered to stimulate the economy, any (economic) news event that implies the FED is less likely to raise interest rates will ultimately benefit businesses as lower borrowing costs make it easier (less expensive) to borrow and invest capital as this climate also encourages consumers to return to the housing market, seek out financing, and put money to work within the economy. Furthermore, low rates make savings accounts and fixed income products (that typically move with interest rates) less attractive, all of which ultimately benefits corporate earnings and their respective stock prices, as investment capital finds its way into more speculative vehicles such as stocks, real estate, (commodities at times), and innovative start-up businesses.\nWith that said, this opposite relationship between the DOW and USD did not always exist. In the years past under high interest rates, stock prices and the USD did enjoy a positive correlation as foreign investment capital that finds its way into US businesses, US stocks,"}

Casa Larga Vineyards in Fairport is the closest, and just won Best Dessert Wine at the Florida International Wine Competition. The March 2007 National Geographic Traveler paid compliment to the Finger Lakes\u2019 \u201clong vistas of blue water\u201d and \u201cwines that stand alongside California\u2019s best.\u201d The Finger Lakes have been featured on the cover of the Wine Spectator and in numerous trade magazines and wine books. The world is just beginning to discover the Finger Lakes, and the next decade will bring growth and big business to the region.\nFor now, the wineries are family-owned and -operated businesses, where visitors will meet two and sometimes three generations of grape growers and winemakers. In Napa and even Long Island, many of the wineries have been purchased by corporations as investments, but the Finger Lakes remains a close-knit community of small-scale wine producers. For links to the wineries and events in the Finger Lakes, visit www.NewYorkWines.org and www.FingerLakesWineGazette.com. The Finger Lakes Wine Festival in Watkins Glen is the best opportunity all year to taste the wines of the region in one place. This year it will take place July 20-22, with roughly 70 wineries attending.\nStarting in the western Finger Lakes, there are several new --- and one really old --- wineries in the Little Finger Lakes (Honeoye, Conesus, and Hemlock lakes). Eaglecrest Winery was started on Hemlock Lake\u2019s west side in 1872 by Bishop Bernard McQuaid, to produce sacramental wine for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester. Now 135 years later, it still produces sacramental wine as well as a new line of table wines.\nOn the west side of Conesus Lake, Deer Run Winery was opened several years ago by Joan and George Kuyon. The disadvantage of the Little Finger Lakes is their shallow water, which does not protect the surrounding hillsides like the exceptionally deep larger Finger Lakes (for comparison Seneca Lake is 630 feet deep; Conesus Lake is 65 feet deep.). Deer Run has planted hardier French-American grapes like Seyval, and several new experimental grapes from the Geneva Experimental Station. Some Rochester Public Market patrons may remember Arbordale Winery, which offered samplings and sales last year. It will build a tasting room on the east side of Conesus Lake in 2007.\nTo experience one of the scenic wonders of the Finger Lakes, take County Route 12 over the hill to Naples. This short road begins south of Bristol Mountain, near the junction of routes 64 and 21, where the Arbor Hill Grapery and Winery is located. The Brahm family continues to plant and make wine with heirloom varieties of grapes like Vergennes and Isabella, as well as new varieties such as Traminette.

It isn\u2019t uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, provide plumbing advice, present a renovation proposal and ensure that the floors are cleaned properly \u2013 all in one day. Facility managers take into account the safety and health of all building users, as they consider how a facility runs. A strong background in management, technical skills, construction fundamentals and technology is needed to be a successful facility manager.\nA facility manager provides oversight for the physical plant of a building or structural campus. All operational facets of managing a facility fall under the job description of a facility manager. Facility managers troubleshoot when something goes wrong, which could be anything from a toilet overflow to a power outage. Proactively, a facility manager examines energy and supply usage to determine cost-cutting measures and potential sustainability improvements. Large and small renovation needs and construction projects fall under a facility manager\u2019s purview. This may involve determining the project, collecting bids and ensuring satisfactory completion. A facility manager often leads a large group of employees who clean and maintain the building, so leading and managing others is a key responsibility of this position.\nEarning an undergraduate degree in facilities management is a plus and, increasingly, a requirement for this field. A college degree program includes classes in construction fundamentals, environmental controls, civic design, energy management, information technology and facility planning. Most programs include an internship to provide practical application of classroom learning. In addition to formal education, advanced certifications and on-the-job training is paramount. Some higher-paying positions require graduate degrees.\nMean annual pay for a facility manager is $99,310 annually or $47.74 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in May 2016. Top salaries are found in urban centers like Minneapolis, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Expect a salary boost when landing a position that manages a substantial budget and a large facility.\nExperience as a facility manager leads to higher level appointments and, potentially, higher salaries. If you don't have an advanced degree, your experience, facility management software expertise or professional credentials will help you advance in this career. Experienced facility managers are sought after for larger operations and complicated projects.\nIndustry data project that the demand for facility managers will grow 5 to 9 percent between 2016 and 2026. Developing specialized skills or becoming an expert on a certain type of facility increases job opportunities. For example, the rapid expansion of long-term care facilities provides increased openings for facility managers with residential medical facility experience.\nKelly, Dr.. \"The Responsibilities of Facility Managers.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/responsibilities-facility-managers-19699.html. 29 June 2018."}

I wanted him to succeed, to turn things around in his classroom, to learn and grow and actualize his goal of becoming a strong and effective teacher. But how much\u2014and for how long\u2014could I ethically \"support\" someone whose challenges were so directly and so adversely impacting so many eighth-grade students?\nI subscribe to Elena Aguilar's model of transformational coaching: Effective coaching can guide clients to change not only their behaviors but also their beliefs and ways of being. This teacher was open to coaching and committed to improving. I had pledged to work with him as much as necessary. The questions remained, however: Is it fair for a student to wait out their teacher's transformational process? What about the content they needs to be learning right now? What about their sense of self as a learner, their self-esteem?\nWorking with this teacher was presenting me with a moral quandary. Only four weeks into the school year, I was already hearing constant complaints about him from other teachers and students.\n\"My students are coming from his class to mine and they're exasperated,\" teachers would tell me.\n\"He doesn't teach us anything!\" the students in general would tell me.\n\"He always sends me out!\" the Black students would tell me.\n\"I hear you,\" I would respond. \"I'm working with him. Don't you see me in the back of the classroom with my walkie-talkie and him with the earpiece in his ear?\"\nThen, during the fifth week of school, frustrated by the student behaviors he could not manage, this teacher, an older white man, said something to two of his Black male students about how they should behave because they would get fewer chances in life, fewer chances in high school. If he had built trust with these students beforehand, they might have \"heard\" what he said differently and assumed positive intent. But that was not the case.\nAll his students\u2014not just the boys to whom the comments were directed\u2014were outraged. They ganged up in support of one another, in solidarity against a teacher who was now perceived to be a common enemy.\nSuddenly my words felt hollow. \"I'm working with him,\" I repeated. I continued to dedicate time to his classroom doing real-time coaching and helping individual students who were frustrated, angry or lost. I also reached out to our Restorative Justice (RJ) Coordinator so that he could attend that class to run an RJ circle. I spoke to some of the more vocal students one-on-one outside class, listening to their experiences and showing them they mattered. I had them write things down. I read what they wrote and found it appalling: \"He thinks I'm retarded,\" one said. \"He doesn't want us to succeed.\"\nWhat was my role here? As his coach, was I supposed to double-down on my work with him, sharing literature and videos, mediating conversations with students and do whatever I could to shore up his major cultural competency gaps? Or should I break confidentiality by going to the principal and suggest he send the teacher packing? Could these students afford to wait out this teacher's learning process?\nI decided to do both. Following the RJ circle, I sat down with the teacher for a coaching conversation, to see if the circle had helped him appreciate the students' perspective and understand why his comments were so harmful. I asked him this directly several times. He didn't know the answer. Finally, I let him read what one of his students had written"}

Last year, France volunteered to join any military campaign the U.S. was prepared to launch to punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians. France also was the first country to send troops to the Central African Republic to help restore the peace there. France is also still has more than a thousand troops deployed in Mali as part of an effort to keep the country from sliding back into civil war.

It's unclear what caused their aluminum rowboat, about 12 to 15 feet long, to overturn, but police said it appears to be accidental.\nPolice believe the friends frantically tried to reach shore before succumbing to the frigid conditions within minutes.\n\"At 38 degrees, we're pretty confident within minutes you're heading into hypothermia,\" state police Capt. David Atkins said on Tuesday.\nBecerra said Ma and Kong started fishing around 2 p.m. Monday in the reservoir, which includes about 30.5 miles of shoreline that snakes along Lewisboro, Somers and Katonah. Around 5 p.m. the men spoke to relatives and said they intended to keep fishing as rain fell and darkness settled in, police said.\nAround 7 a.m. Tuesday, another fisherman spotted the capsized boat and saw one of the dead men, Atkins said. Police then found the second man's body, and spent several hours searching in case anyone else had been in the boat, but they determined that Ma and Kong were the only ones in the boat before it overturned.\nThe capsized boat was found 150 to 200 yards from shore. Becerra said there was no indication that Ma or Kong was impaired at the time.\nPolice from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection also responded, as well as a scuba team with sonar, police helicopters and police dogs. The reservoir is owned by New York City and is a part of the city's water supply system."}

In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable.\nGov. Phil Murphy\u2019s signing into law a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid to help pay for college beginning this fall won\u2019t help all who hope to attend a post-secondary school, but it could help many.\nWith Murphy\u2019s signing, New Jersey becomes the 10th state to extend financial aid to undocumented college students. Other states include those both \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue,\u201d from Oregon to Texas. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P.

They have played by the rules.\nThey have maintained their grades, played sports, played in the band and competed on debate teams. They are as worthy as any students in New Jersey, and we should be proud to allow them greater access to our esteemed state colleges.\nThe New Jersey law, which was overwhelmingly approved in the Democratic-controlled Legislature along mostly party lines, extends financial aid to undocumented students in New Jersey who are living in the country illegally, as long as they meet certain requirements. Funds that will be available to students under the new law include the Tuition Aid Grant program, known as TAG.\nThe new law finishes old business in Trenton, and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act. That act, signed by Gov. Chris Christie, allowed the undocumented immigrants to pay in-state resident tuition at New Jersey\u2019s public colleges and universities. But Christie vetoed the financial aid component of the law.\nAs The Record reported, at least 759 students enrolled in New Jersey colleges were paying in-state tuition under the Tuition Equality Act. A previous fiscal analysis of the Senate financial aid bill by the Office of Legislative Services estimated that the state would have to allocate an additional $4.47 million to provide grants to 600 eligible students. The report noted that the state set aside $425.9 million for grants in the current fiscal year. In our view, the investment is worth it.\nThe expansion gives the law its intended and needed punch, and will allow more students across the socioeconomic spectrum to pursue a college degree.\nAs Murphy said in his speech, New Jersey has always been a state proud of its diversity. This bill reaffirms that pride \u2014 in our people, in our state and in our many diverse communities.\nGiving young people a chance to go forward and pursue their dreams \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more American, or Jersey, than that."}

In 2008, JRC told Boston Magazine students were typically shocked just once a week. Then in 2010, Linda Doherty told ABC News her son was shocked 40 times one week and 18 times the next week.\nDue to the wide range of reports, it's unknown how often students are shocked. JRC did not respond to requests for information on its practices.\nAs a hypothetical example, let's say a student is typically shocked an average of two times a week.

The first time was in 1983 for prosthetic hair fibers, which were scalp implantation devices to simulate natural hair. The FDA, however, found the devices did not work and could cause serious injury or illness.\nThey have also recently placed a proposed ban on Powdered Surgeon's Gloves, Powdered Patient Examination Gloves, and Absorbable Powder for Lubricating a Surgeon's Glove.

After a while, the car wouldn't start. A staffer typically drives Rangel to and from his son's home in Clinton, Md., where he stays while in Washington.\n\"It was always a question of, 'We need to deal with this,' \" Dalley said. \"There was always a mixture of inconvenience and procrastination more than there was a feeling of hurry because we were violating the storage rules.\"\nRangel was not notified that he was in violation, Dalley said.

An influx of upscale, expensive units and a dearth of rental options in some parts of the region caused the average monthly rent price during the third quarter to increase 4.6 percent to $1,053.\nThe report, issued late Monday, showed that variations among the metro area submarkets continue to deepen. In downtown Minneapolis, where 2,040 units have been added over the past 21 months, the average vacancy rate was 7 percent.

Among the places where are apartments are hardest to find are Apple Valley/Rosemount (with a vacancy rate of 1.6 percent), Blaine (1.7 percent) and Cottage Grove (0.08 percent).\nVacancies are highest in downtown Minneapolis, in the Uptown neighborhoods of south Minneapolis and around the University of Minnesota. In those areas, building managers are offering discounts on rent and other concessions to entice renters.\nBrent Wittenberg, Marquette\u2019s vice president, said such concessions are more typical during fall when property managers are eager to fill their buildings before the onset of winter. Concessions are more typical, he said, on newer, more expensive two-bedroom units that might otherwise appeal to young professionals.\n\u201cMore affluent millennials are opting to buy a home rather than rent a two-bedroom apartment with greater frequency than they were one to two years ago,\u201d Wittenberg said.\nMary Bujold, president of Maxfield Research and Consulting, isn\u2019t concerned about the number of concessions that are being offered.

But humans aren't the only ones whose vocal stylings suffer when intoxicated. Birds don't sing so well when they're drunk, either.\nAfter sipping some spiked juice, zebra finches began to slur their songs, according to a study released last week by Oregon Health and Science University.\nWhy get birds drunk in the first place? Researchers study bird songs to help understand human speech patterns. Just as humans develop speech from listening to others talk, finches develop song in a similar fashion. Anyone who has struggled through the sloppy and incoherent chatter of a tipsy pal knows that alcohol changes how people talk. By testing out booze on birds, scientists can gain insight into the impact of alcohol on the brain mechanism that affects the ability to speak in humans.\nThere's no breathalyzer for the striped bird to blow into, but a simple blood test confirmed that the birds reached an intoxication level just skimming the legal driving limit, between .05 and .08 percent. Birds metabolize alcohol differently from humans, so this was more than enough to garble their communication.\nMost notably, the birds sing with \"decreased amplitude and increased entropy,\" the study reports. Meaning, they get a bit quieter, mess up the song structure, and basically don't sound as clear and crisp.\nThe slurred results are far from surprising, but not every syllable suffers the same fate. Picking apart the different acoustic structures revealed that some sounds became sloppy and others remained intact, leading researchers to believe that alcohol impacts specific regions of the brain more than others.\nThis isn't the last foray into buzzed birds for the sake of research, according to The Washington Post. Additional studies are in the works to determine whether alcohol impacts the birds' ability to learn new songs."}

Seeing the 30-hectare site filled with solar panels is not only a sharp contrast to the landscape, but also to the province and its massive oil and gas industry.\nThe Brooks project, which launched last week, is the first utility scale solar facility in Western Canada, far surpassing any other solar project currently operating. This is the first of several renewable energy projects to be constructed in Alberta as the province shifts away from coal power plants.\nThe 50,000 solar panels will collect enough sunlight to power 3,000 homes, according to Vancouver-based developer Elemental Energy. The Brooks solar project is more than five years in the making, although actual construction took seven months.\nThere's a bit of an Alberta flair to the project. On the same land as the solar panels is an active oil pumpjack, a sour gas well, natural gas pipelines, an internet fibre optic cable and an agricultural irrigation ditch.\n\"This area is agriculture and oil and gas, but it's really just resources. [Solar] is just another resource,\" says Graeme Millen, with Elemental Energy. \"With the shared uses on this property between oil and gas, fibre optic, agricultural irrigation \u2014 it's a fantastic showcase for diverse resource development on Alberta land.\"\nOn this day, the solar panels are half covered in snow following a few days snowfall in southern Alberta. It's also the shortest days of the year around the winter solstice. The panels are still producing electricity, albeit far below their potential.\n\"In the event it snows, you lose production, for sure. The good news is in this part of the world, in southeast Alberta, it doesn't snow that much compared to a lot of other jurisdictions,\" said Millen. \"The snow is light so it blows off with the winds we have and because we get so many sunny days. Once the sun starts shining, the snow melts quite quickly.\"\nThe project cost $30 million and developers received $15 million in grant funding from the former Progressive Conservative government through Emissions Reduction Alberta.\nAlberta is set to embark on a renewable energy revolution. Some renewable energy already exists in the province, but the sector is about to grow substantially.

The crowd featured more women than typically seen during the Masters, especially young girls with their parents. Sorenstam and her daughter walked with the final group.\nThe golf was superb, at least at the top of the leaderboard.\nOnly six women finished under par, and no one challenged Kupcho or Fassi, a senior at Arkansas from Mexico. Both sent a message of their own long before the tournament by earning LPGA Tour cards last year and deferring until after they finished college.\nFassi, who started one shot behind, took her first lead with a pitch over the mounds to 2 feet for birdie on the par-5 eighth. Kupcho had reason to believe she was in trouble when a migraine surfaced, causing vision so blurry she couldn\u2019t see the line she marks on her ball while putting. She three-putted the 10th to fall two behind, and sat on a bench at the 11th tee to gather herself.\nShe learned in the practice round on the 13th fairway that even with the ball above her feet on the severely sloped fairway, the shot tends to go straight.

In January of last year, the Obama administration accelerated the deployment of military vessels off the Iranian coast and placed antimissile systems in at least four Arab countries neighboring Iran.\nMost notable is the US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain \u2013 less than 160 miles off the Iranian coast \u2013 which directs operations in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea and secures the Straits of Hormuz, through which 40 per cent of the world\u2019s seaborne oil passes. It is one of the largest military forces in the region, with over 40 vessels and close to 30,000 personnel.\nThe Fifth Fleet consists of a Carrier Battle Group, which includes an aircraft carrier, two guided missile cruisers equipped with Tomahawks for long-range strike capability, a guided missile destroyer for air warfare, a destroyer for submarine warfare, a frigate, two attack submarines, and a combined ammunition, oiler and supply ship. The Fifth Fleet also docks an Amphibious Ready Group, which consists of multiple other vessels including aircraft carriers, attack helicopters, a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, and more.\nThese and other US Navy warships patrol the waterways along Iran\u2019s southern border on a daily basis, often with the explicit intention of provoking Iran. In 2007, the Bush administration deployed \u201cthe largest daytime assembly of US warships in the Gulf since the 2003 Iraq war to hold drills off Iran\u2019s coast in a major U.S. show of force.\u201d The assembly included about 17,000 personnel and 140 aircraft in addition to the usual, and was sent without notifying the Iranian government.\nThe announcement by the Iranian Navy official comes weeks after the US got Turkey to agree to host a NATO anti-ballistic system aimed at spotting missiles coming from Iran. Turkey had agreed to the deal with the explicit condition that its neighbor Iran not be named as the impetus, strongly suggesting Iran was the primary target.\nThis demonstrates another aspect important to the context of US militaristic provocation towards Iran. Aside from warships to Iran\u2019s south, the US makes major arms deals and sends significant amounts of security assistance to nearly all of Iran\u2019s neighboring countries including Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, not to mention the two hot wars and client states the US is engaged in directly to Iran\u2019s east and west in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nIran\u2019s supposed plan to place navy vessels somewhere near America\u2019s Atlantic coast, as the official who announced it said explicitly, is merely a response to the decades worth of US militaristic provocation towards Iran. Some in the US are objecting strongly to this, seeming implicitly to state that America doesn\u2019t have to abide by the same rules Iran does and that America should not have to accept the obvious repercussions of aggressive foreign policies.\nOf"}

Barring something completely unforeseen he will be firmly entrenched in the starting lineup for the Stars for years to come starting with Day 1. The expectations for his first year performance are going to be understandably high.\nHeiskanen has had a memorable year. He took a regular shift at the Olympics where he was electric. He competed for his country at both the World Junior Championships and World Championships, making him one of a select few who can claim the honor of competing in all three tournaments in one year.\nDuring the World Championships, Heiskanen was profiled by Sports Illustrated where he shared some wisdom about the tournament that will be key to keep in mind for Stars fans when setting expectations for his rookie season.\n\"It was tough sometimes but mostly quite easy because I play with smarter players. Of course, the play is faster than at the junior category and I face stronger guys,\" he said.\n\"It's nice to face those guys and see where I am,\" Heiskanen said. \"It's a good test to play them, maybe I will play them next year in the NHL. I want to play there as soon as possible, that's my goal.\"\nHe's a kid, but he has already been playing against and dominating grown men. Heiskanen skated for 25 minutes per night in Finland's top league, Liiga, with 23 points in 30 games which is absurd for an 18-year-old defenseman.\nOne of the struggles for young players when they debut is fighting through physically mature adults for the first time while trying to establish their game. Miro? He was named the top defenseman in Liiga, and he already successfully faced Edmonton Oilers sensation Connor McDavid head on at the World Championships.\nNo one particular skill stands out for Heiskanen. He does everything well. The nuance to his game is what is going to set him apart. It's hard to really put into words the type of player he is other than to say you just need to spend some time watching him closely. He skates well, he has a good wrist shot, and he has a very high hockey IQ. If you were trying to build the prototypical modern defenseman you'd start with Heiskanen's skill set.\nSetting expectations too high is a concern, but the Stars haven't had a prospect like this come through since Mike Modano. Heiskanen entered the organization with high expectations, and somehow he has continued to raise the bar without showing a single crack in his armor.\nDefensemen have only won the Calder Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year eleven times since the award was first handed out in 1933.

Her father ran a boot factory founded by her grandfather. She took brief courses in Croatian at Zagreb University, international relations in Switzerland and Slavonic studies in London. She worked as a secretary and then at a British refugee charity in Poland while writing occasional articles about the looming war in Europe. Friends influenced her decision to focus on journalism rather than politics.\nThe Daily Telegraph\u2019s editor gave her a job as a stringer and sent her to Poland, partly because of her work with refugees in that country, according to her great-nephew, Patrick Garrett.\nThough she carved out a career in what was then a male-dominated field, Garrett said she looked back on her achievements matter-of-factly.\n\u201cShe would never regard herself as a feminist,\u201d Garrett said.

She hated it when women wasted time on makeup or getting their hair done,\u201d Garrett said.\nAfter the Polish invasion, Hollingworth covered the Romanian Revolution and hostilities in North Africa.

Thus, the chances for a US-Mexican accord on how to deal with El Salvador and the troubled region surrounding it are still rated as slim. But the State Department is carefully studying the Mexican proposals.\nOne Latin American specialist says that the Mexicans' unprecedented push to promote the proposals -- first made public in Managua, Nicaragua, by President Jose Lopez Portillo -- is based to a degree on a pessimistic appraisal of the situation in El Salvador.\nOn March 6, Mr. Haig met in New York with Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda de la Rosa, to discuss the Mexican plan. But Haig made it clear that, in the US view, the essential element missing from the Mexican proposals was a provision dealing explicitly with Nicaragua's supply of arms to Salvadoran guerrillas.\nFor his part, Castenada said that Mexico believed that the amount of arms supplied by Nicaragua to the guerrillas was limited. He also said the flow of such arms could perhaps be halted if the Reagan administration made peaceful gestures toward Nicaragua.\nMexico's proposals call for a negotiated settlement of the fighting in El Salvador, for a non-aggression pact between the US and Nicaragua, and for talks between the US and Cuba designed to produce mutual concessions in the region.\nThe US has been calling for a settlement in El Salvador within the context of the forthcoming elections there. But Castenada dismissed the elections as meaningless, given the absence of candidates from among the guerrilla forces.\nMexico might be in a position to mediate the Salvadoran conflict because it maintains good relations with Cuba, Nicaragua, and with representatives of the Salvadoran guerrillas. It has special ties with anticommunist governments in the region through concessionary sales of Mexican oil.\nIn a paper concerning US and Mexican policies toward Central America, Robert L.

It wasn't until the late 1980s and in the 1990s that it became the cosmopolitan city it is today, and it owes much of that sophistication to other waves of immigrants, from Mexico, Central and South America, who added new layers to the culture of that big immigrant wave of the Great Depression.\nNow, when I heard that the Golden State is selling off the furniture signed by its movie-star governor to raise money, I'm sure that a reverse migration is on the way. The grandchildren of Depression-era immigrants will be coming back to the Midwest to reinhabit the places their grandparents abandoned.

More sophisticated toys appeared in Ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt. But it wasn\u2019t until the beginning of the 20th Century that toys were mass produced, promoted through advertising campaigns and became part of the popular culture. This series looks at 100 years of toys, a decade at a time.\nRUBIK\u2019S CUBE: Although it was patented in 1975, Rubik\u2019s Cube didn\u2019t become an international sensation until the early 1980s, when it was licensed to the Ideal Toy Corp.\nNamed for its creator, Hungarian sculptor Emo Rubik, the multi-colored cube challenges players to twist its rotatable sections until each side of the cube is aligned by color \u2014 a feat that can take seconds, hours, months or years. With more than 350 million units sold, it is the top-selling puzzle game of all time.\nCABBAGE PATCH KIDS: Created in the 1970s by 21-year-old art student Xavier Roberts, these soft, hand-stitched dolls, initially called The Little People, were sold at craft fairs until 1982 when they were licensed to Coleco.\nThe dolls had already been getting serious press (in Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal) and, throughout the early \u201880s, they were considered must-have Christmas gifts, so highly coveted that their limited availability each December led to near-riots in toy stores. The dolls, which came with names and birth certificates, were \u201cadopted\u201d by their owners, who took them everywhere.\nTRANSFORMERS: In 1984, Hasbro struck gold when it gained the distribution rights to a line of Japanese toys that could \u201ctransform\u201d from vehicles or animals into robot action figures.\nThe good guys are the Autobots, the bad guys are the Decepticons, and how you use them is entirely up to you. The toys inspired a comic book series, a TV series and a wildly successful quintet of films that have grossed more than $4 billion. Ask any Transformers fan what he or she likes about the toys and they\u2019ll likely use the same word. They\u2019re just... cool.\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: Introduced in their own comic book in 1984, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles soon morphed into one of the most popular franchises in all of Toyland.\nThe Turtles became an animated series in 1987, but action figures and play sets were already selling well. Then, of course, there were video games and feature films. The group also had its own cereal, corn snacks and pudding pies. At the time, almost anything with a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on the box was a hit. And they remain popular with a new generation of kids.\nGAME BOY: For some toy lovers, the Game Boy, introduced in 1989, marked the beginning of the end. It was a hand-held game console, manufactured by Nintendo, that allowed kids to take their Tetris and their Mario Brothers anywhere that they went.\nThose games are considered primitive by today\u2019s standards, but in their day they were addictive and commanded the users\u2019"}

Never did a man appear so diffident. And then he opens his mouth.\nLoach has spent the past half-century making films that shake with anger, and is just about to release his angriest yet. I, Daniel Blake, winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at the 2016 Cannes film festival, is about a man broken by the British benefits system. His doctor says he is too sick to work after a near-fatal heart attack, but the Department for Work and Pensions decides he is not entitled to sickness benefit. Blake finds himself trapped in a downward spiral after his jobseeker\u2019s allowance is suspended, because he is thought not to be trying hard enough to find the work he is unfit to do. The film is so spare and spartan, it could be a parable. It is also immensely moving \u2013 particularly a scene in a food bank, when a young mother Blake has befriended breaks down in a manner that borders on the feral.\nIn many ways, I, Daniel Blake can be seen as a companion piece to Cathy Come Home, Loach\u2019s seminal 1966 film about a young family\u2019s descent into homelessness, which resulted in a parliamentary debate and raised public awareness of homelessness. But while Cathy led to real social change, Loach predicts people will not be outraged by Daniel: they will accept it as normal that a man should be cheated out of benefits by the state, or a young single mother has to move from London to Newcastle to find herself a scrap of a home.\nIn the 60s and 70s, Loach belonged to small leftist groups: the Socialist Labour League (forerunner of the Workers Revolutionary Party), the International Socialists, the International Marxist Group, all critical of both western capitalism and the Stalinism of the Soviet Union. They\u2019d swot up on Marxism, debate it intensely and tell anybody who\u2019d listen that capitalism was unsustainable: it would devour itself, and the working classes in the process. But it was all guesswork. At the time, the ready availability of jobs and a relatively well-funded welfare state suggested capitalism was actually doing just dandy.\nI recently watched The Big Flame, Loach\u2019s 1969 TV film about 10,000 Liverpool dockers staging a work-in. In the film, one docker strums the song Joe Hill on his guitar, while another explains that Hill\u2019s famous line was delivered when he was facing the firing squad after being framed for murder. Today, Loach argues that the struggle to organise is made tougher by the fact that so many workers are technically self-employed and not part of a collective. Again, he quotes Joe Hill at me.\nCritics say Loach\u2019s weakness is that he has never changed: he is still delivering the same Marxist sermon he was half a century ago. His fans argue that this is his strength. Loach himself, now an unlikely 80 years old, would ask why on earth he should change when the system remains the same.\nBut Loach was not always a lefty \u2013 far from it. At school, he represented the Tories in a mock election. \u201cI don\u2019t think too much should be made of that,\u201d he says. I had assumed he was playing devil\u2019s advocate, or it was just a passing teenage whim, but no, he says: these were the values with which he was brought up. Lo"}

Even when a closet is carefully organized at the beginning, however, it might not take long for order to turn to chaos.\n\u201cIt's common for clients to struggle with keeping the momentum going,\u201d says interior designer Caitlin Murray. But there are strategies to help closets stay as organized as they were on day one.\nWe've asked Murray, founder of the Los Angeles-based Black Lacquer Design, and two other experts \u2013 Delaware-based home designer and builder Marnie Oursler, and Elena Eskandari, an interior design specialist with Case Design/Remodeling in the Washington, D.C., area \u2013 for advice on planning and living with efficient and attractive closet space.\nThe same closet design doesn't work for everyone, so analyze the items you need to store. If you'll be hanging a lot of clothes, are they long or short? You may want two levels of hanging space positioned one above the other to maximize storage, says Oursler. Have a lot of shoes? Consider a row of built-in shoe cubbies along the floor.\nThen choose a system you'll actually stick with. If you plan to put everything on hangers but that's an extra step that you'll probably avoid, then you'll end up with piles of clothes in your bedroom.\nWhile organizing, pare down: Even a well-planned closet may not stay organized if it's very full. What do you really like and really wear? If you haven't worn something in a while, Eskandari says, chances are you don't need to keep it.\nShe suggests separate spaces for everything, with more shelves fairly close together rather than a few spaced far apart. She's also a fan of shelf dividers to keep one type of clothing or pantry item from another.\nThese designers acknowledge that built-in shelving and compartments can be expensive, but they say it's often worth the investment for a really efficient master bedroom closet or kitchen pantry.\nAs you plan these areas, focus on what you use most. \u201cStore the items you reach for most often in the places where you have the easiest access, so you're not constantly pushing everything around to find one thing,\u201d says Murray.\nAnd use transparent storage (glass-faced cabinets or clear acrylic drawers are great if you're doing built-ins, or clear bins on shelves) to make access even easier.\nOursler agrees that kids often do better with bins or baskets on shelves and simple cubbies for shoes. If you'd rather your kids hang things up, hooks are more likely to get used than hangers. \u201cDon't overcomplicate things for kids or teenagers,\u201d says Eskandari."}

You Should, Too.\nThe Indo shirt delivers a relaxed fit and a fun print for all your warm-weather adventures.\nThe perfect summer shirt is not easy to find. Most shirts are fine. They get the job done in that they cover your top half. Maybe they're even lightweight or done up in a fun fabric or color! But too many shirts are static. They're just a T-shirt or just a dress shirt or just a graphic tee you bought at a gift shop because you felt like it. Very few times is any old shirt a perfect shirt. This Indo one from Allsaints? It's perfect.\nYou see, this shirt combines every element that makes a shirt work for a certain occasion. The occasion this time? Summer, when the air is hot and sticky and you'd rather be wearing nothing but still need to wear something. Luckily, Allsaints has perfected the art of creating a shirt that's lightweight but not delicate, stylish but not short-lived. Plus, it works in every kind of warm-weather environment: with swim trunks, dark denim, and even with a suit. It's not just a shirt; it's a summer shirt, perfected. Here's why you should get one.\nIt's relaxed in the right way.\nThe quest for a shirt that feels laid-back but not sloppy is endless. This type of shirt\u2014button-front and camp-collared\u2014is a prime example of a top that does it right. The fabric has movement to it, so it's not restrictive in either how it wears or how it looks. And because it still has a buttoned front and a collar, the silky fabric never leans too far into relaxation mode.\nThe ability to transition between different modes of dress is an absolute essential for a shirt to be a perfect shirt. Indo (can we call you Indo?) does just that. It's all in how you interpret the vibe. If you're trying to lean into its relaxed elements, you can certainly play those up. Wear it unbuttoned over a white T-shirt with shorts and Birkenstocks. Or, juxtapose the whole vacation vibe and wear it with trousers or a full suit. The shirt makes the look fun, and the tailored pieces tie it all together.\nThis print is good. Very good.\nIf ever there were a time for a bright color in a fun print, it's summertime.

The dentist had lied to her and deceived her, and deceived his own family as well, she told KWTV in Tulsa.\nLincoln Lewis was Roxanne\u2019s son, described as a happy child who fought hard for his entire 19-month life to overcome physical problems that he\u2019s suffered since his premature birth. The little boy often wore a helmet to protect his still-developing skull, according to a report by KOTV News in Oklahoma.\nBut on July 17 police say, Randall left Franklin alone with the child as she was upstairs in her Oklahoma City home, and in that time, Franklin did something to fracture the boy\u2019s skull.\nRandall told police that she heard a \u201cthud\u201d from downstairs. Franklin claimed the sound came from a ball he threw across the room to the family dog. But police didn\u2019t buy his story.\nThe following video news report from KOCO TV News contains further details on the crime, and the accusations against Bert Franklin in the death of little Lincoln Lewis.\nHours after hearing the \u201cthud,\u201d Randall noticed that her son was sleeping with his eyes open and snoring loudly, but would not wake up. He was then rushed to Mercy Hospital in Oklahoma City.\nThe boy was transferred by helicopter to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children\u2019s Hospital in Tulsa. But doctors there were unable to save Lincoln, and he died as a result of his injuries the next day.\nAn autopsy revealed that Lincoln had hemorrhaging in both eyes and severe brain swelling. The autopsy also showed not one, but two fractures to his skull, according to The Oklahoman.\nAccording to Oklahoma City Police Detective Andrea Motley, Randall said that Franklin had recently been exhibiting disturbing \u201ccontrolling behavior\u201d and had threatened to kill and mutilate the father of her child.\nFranklin is a native of Tulsa who had been a practicing dentist there for the past eight years. He appears in the following video, advertising his dental practice, Signature Smiles.\nPolice may be able to find clues as to exactly what transpired in the downstairs room between Bert Franklin and the little boy after they examine the contents of a hard drive from a home surveillance security system in Randall\u2019s home.\nBert Franklin was held with no bail after being charged with first degree murder in the killing of the boy.

Going forward, all donors will be disclosed on an annual basis, and new donations from foreign governments will be scrutinized by government ethics officers.\"\nThe release of the Clinton donors shows for the first time the scope of his international fundraising and charitable efforts since leaving the White House in 2001. Norway and the national charitable lottery of the Netherlands gave more than $5 million, for example, and the Swedish lottery also donated. The Jamaican and Italian governments each contributed more than $50,000.\n\"It is going to be complex to disassociate the specialized interests of the foundation of Bill Clinton from certain foreign interests that are represented by the U.S. government,\" said James Thurber of American University's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. \"But I think they can do it. I don't think it is a major issue yet, but you never know, when it comes to Bill Clinton, what might come out.\"\nSince it was established in 1997, the Clinton Foundation has raised more than $500 million, which has financed construction of Clinton's presidential library in Little Rock as well as charitable programs in global health, poverty, climate change and education. The donations have gone to an estimated 150 countries and provided medication to some 1.4 million people living with AIDS, according to foundation staff. In partnership with former president George H.W. Bush, the foundation also raised millions of dollars for recovery efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina.\nThe list released yesterday includes some controversial figures and companies. Affiliates of the Korean conglomerate Hanwha -- Hanwha L&C, Hanwha Engineering and Construction, and Hanwha Stores -- donated about $1 million after Clinton traveled to Seoul in 2003 and appeared with Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn. Kim has been charged and jailed in Korea on public corruption allegations.\nAnother donation followed Clinton's trip to Kazakhstan in 2005 on the private jet of Frank Giustra, a financier of mining ventures. On the trip, Clinton praised Kazakhstan's authoritarian president, and"}
{"idx": "16278", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, poses with current President Francois Hollande prior to their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Thursday, January 8, 2015, in connection with a terrorist attack. Police hunted Thursday for two heavily armed men, one with possible links to al-Qaida, in the methodical killing of 12 people at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that caricatured the Prophet Muhammed.\nIn recent days France has seen 13 people killed in 2 terrorist attacks. A third attack is underway as I write. What will be the political fallout from these events?\nBecause the alleged attackers have been linked in press reports to a jihadi recruitment organization known as the Buttes-Chaumont network, it is natural to assume that the Front National (FN), a party of the extreme right noted for its hostility to what it sees as growing Islamist influence in the French suburbs, will be the primary beneficiary. Even before the attacks, some polls indicated that the FN, led by Marine Le Pen, is now the largest party in France. Le Pen\u2019s party will thus likely receive a boost in municipal and regional elections scheduled for later this year.\nThe Front National therefore threatens the two parties that have dominated the French political scene for 40 years: the currently ruling Socialist Party (PS) and the center-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). Racked by a recent scandal that led to the ouster of former party leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, the UMP is now headed by former president Nicolas Sarkozy. In the wake of the first terror attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who defeated Sarkozy in 2012, decided to make a show of national unity against terrorism by inviting his erstwhile rival to meet with him at the Elys\u00e9e.\nThe staging of the event was interesting: The two men sat in identical armchairs, face to face, in the presidential palace. Beyond national unity, the photograph of this meeting that was released to the press contained an ulterior message: that the parties represented by these two men constituted the \u201crepublican\u201d rampart against the threat of terrorism. The Front National, France\u2019s third major party, was not represented.\nThe t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Hollande also had the effect of rehabilitating Sarkozy, whose image had been tarnished by numerous allegations of corruption. In a national emergency, however, it was to Sarkozy that Hollande turned, raising the status of his former nemesis to that of officially anointed leader of the opposition and effacing memories of scandal attached to his name. The leaders of France\u2019s other parties, including Marine Le Pen, were also invited to meet with the president, but only after the \u201csummit\u201d meeting with Sarkozy. The difference in status was underscored by the difference in protocol. In short, the carefully crafted publicity surrounding these meetings suggested a desire to reduce the French political contest to a PS-UMP duopoly, banishing the FN to the antipodes.\nThen Hollande announced that Sunday, January 11, would be a day of national mourning in which all political parties were invited to participate, except the FN. PS spokesman Fran\u00e7ois Lamy later declared that the FN had not been invited because it was a party that \u201cdivides the country and plays on fear.\u201d The irony of excluding the country\u2019s largest party from an event intended to demonstrate national unity was apparently lost on Lamy, who said he could not"}

{"idx": "16281", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: It's often said that smell is the sense most closely tied to memory. This is nonsense. Yes, a scent may on occasion provoke an emphatic, unmediated recollection, but it is typically an imprecise one--a general period in one's life rather than a particular moment. Our specific memories, by contrast, are primarily visual and auditory, not unlike a movie playing in the mind's eye. It's hardly surprising, then, that cinema has often been described as a kind of synthetic memory. As John Malkovich, playing director F.W. Murnau in Shadow of the Vampire, explained, \"We are scientists engaged in the creation of memory, but our memory will neither blur nor fade.\"\nWith Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry have created a film whose entire purpose is to blur and fade, a self-erasing tribute to the fragility of memory and of love. The film, released on video this week, begins simply enough: One cold, gray Valentine's morning, moody introvert Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) decides on impulse to skip work and take a train out to Montauk, Long Island. There, on a desolate beach, he encounters manic extrovert Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). The two begin talking on the train ride home to New York, and over the next two nights love begins to bloom.\nBut as with Kaufman's earlier scripts (Human Nature, Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), things soon turn complicated. This is not the new romance that Joel and Clementine perceive it to be. The two of them have, in fact, just recently broken up after two years of living together. Eager to \"get on with her life,\" Clementine had all memory of Joel erased from her mind by a low-rent medical outfit called Lacuna. Discovering Clementine's betrayal, Joel decided to have the procedure performed on himself as well. That night, unconscious in his bed as Lacuna technicians work (and play) around him, Joel relives each memory of Clementine even as it is wiped from his brain. The erasing process (and with it, the movie) works backward in time, beginning with the most recent memories, full of fights and ill-will. But as the process reaches further back, to moments of tenderness and joy, Joel rediscovers his love for Clementine and realizes he does not want to lose these memories after all. He tries frantically to find an obscure corner of his mind where he can hide some scrap of her from the technicians' hunt and destroy mission, but they always find him. He watches helplessly as, one by one, each memory is irretrievably lost--titles fade from the covers of books, passersby disappear, and then Clementine too vanishes, only to reappear in another doomed recollection, all the way back to their very first meeting, at a beach party in Montauk.\nThe story-told-in-reverse is a common enough movie device, usually utilized to conceal information from the audience. But Kaufman and Gondry use it to a different end, gradually uncovering not hidden facts but forgotten emotions. There are no unexpected twists or sudden revelations about Joel and Clementine, just a wistful backward view of love's decay. Unlike Kaufman's previous work, Eternal Sunshine sets out not to stun us with the originality of its gimmicks, but rather to wound us with the earnest familiarity"}

One moderate leader calls the whole thing merely an exercise in shifting blame away from conservatives.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan smiles as he walks out of a House Freedom Caucus meeting on Capitol Hill.\nThe once dead and buried Obamacare repeal and replacement bill has new life after the far-right Freedom Caucus endorsed the newest version of the bill. The endorsement could be enough for Republicans to pass a bill to scrap the Affordable Care Act through the House.\nIt\u2019s the first major breakthrough since Republican leadership had to withdraw their American Health Care Act ahead of a doomed House vote last month.\nThe Freedom Caucus took heat from President Donald Trump when they refused to support the initial AHCA, but it appears to have paid off in the end.\nThe new bill pulls the AHCA farther right and potentially eliminates even more tenets of Obamacare, just as the Freedom Caucus wanted. The new bill would allow states to waive Obamacare rules such as the ban on charging people with pre-existing conditions higher premiums and essential health benefits, or the minimum requirements for what health insurance plans must cover.\nThe new version maintains the original plan to cut Medicaid funding and substantial Obamacare taxes, gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and allow people to forego buying insurance at the risk of facing higher premiums.\nThe bill\u2019s fate now rests in the hands of Republican moderates who could pass or kill the amended AHCA in the House. They\u2019re in a particularly tough spot because the new draft comes not from a hardline conservative, but from one of their own.\nNew Jersey Rep. Tom MacArthur broke ranks from the moderate Tuesday Group and worked with the Freedom Caucus to draft the new amendment which includes the Obamacare waivers.\nRepublicans had promised since the 2016 campaign season not to revert to the old days when chronically ill people were priced out of the insurance market. The MacArthur amendment addresses this by forcing states opting out of Obamacare protections to fund high-risk pools instead in order to treat the most expensive patients.\nUsing these waivers would be up to the states, and the amendment says states must first show that adopting the waivers will lead to more people getting health coverage. But Freedom Caucus members said after earlier meetings that the White House had expressed it would be lenient in allowing states to use the waivers.\nStill, a vote for the bill will give Democrats a new arsenal of attack points about broken promises to use in future elections. Moderate Republicans must now choose between supporting the bill and taking that election risk, or voting down the bill and being blamed by their president and the rest of their party for allowing the health care bill to die again.\nOne Tuesday Group member said he enough moderates will oppose the bill that it will fail. But publicly, most members kept their hands to their chests Wednesday. Many said they needed more time to study the amendment. Some who supported the previous GOP health care bill, such as Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, said they were now undecided.\nMacArthur ran away from reporters and refused to answer questions about his amendment Wednesday afternoon. But Tuesday Group co-chair Rep.

Besides depicting lemurs in the wild, the movie describes Wright\u2019s work to keep them alive in their natural habitat.\nCurrent thinking, Welch said, is that a group of ancestral lemurs was swept out to sea from Africa and floated on a mat of vegetation across the Mozambique Channel to Madagascar \u2013 about 300 miles. With no natural predators to meet them on the 270,000 square-mile island, they thrived and developed into hundreds of distinct species.\n\u201cIt speaks to the power of nature, what can happen because of random events,\u201d Welch said.\nMost of the 3-D movie was shot on location, no easy feat given the heavy equipment and wild terrain. The first two scenes were filmed at the Lemur Center, but those presented challenges of their own, according to writer/producer Drew Fellman.\nThe first scene shows a group of lemurs floating across the ocean, and that required \u201ccasting\u201d from the Duke population to find which would suit the job.\nThe filmmakers settled on several fat-tailed dwarf lemurs, which are thought to closely resemble the proto-lemurs of 60 million years ago. They were filmed in front of a green screen so a background could be added later, and were supposed to emerge from shadow into light as if coming out to inspect their new home.\nTrouble was, fat-tailed dwarf lemurs are nocturnal, Fellman said, and as soon as they got close to light they fell asleep.\nScene two was not so problematic. It depicts a lemur, a ringtail named Licinius, playing with a computer. Licinius has been an experiment subject using touch-screens, and in the movie \u2013 with the aid of some more special effects \u2013 he is seen clicking through the evolutionary family tree until he gets to lemurs."}

Apparently yes. Krazy old 3D with the same nutty glasses and the same sharks and airplanes zooming right past the camera and the same rock stars pointing right at YOU with their long three-dimensional fingers. The new-style glasses are even clumsier than the old paper blue/red ones, and who would have thought that possible?\nThe big shock of CES to me was how much the \u201cnew\u201d high-tech 3D image looks like the old Vincent Price-era 3D image. With all the hype, I\u2019d figured there must be something new and mindblowing. But to my laymen\u2019s eyes, the images looked more or less the same.\nBesides which, nobody has yet explained to me why a gag that was a flash in the pan in the 1950s is now supposed to be such a great enhancer of the human TV experience.\nSure, the industry loves it. To get 3D at home you\u2019ll need one of the new high-def TVs, a new Blu-Ray player for 3D, and those krazy hi-tech goggles (at about $200 a throw). Now multiply by 114 million TV households in the United States. Now add another billion worldwide. 3D would be the greatest coup in the long history of home entertainment upgrades.\n3D movies are fine, even lovable, as a niche concept. Avatar or Up in 3D?

The thrill is not (with apologies to NFL Films) seeing the ball spiraling past in slo-mo 3D as if it were disappearing over our heads into the spare bathroom.\nHe\u2019s right. Choosing your ending may sound swell, but it doesn\u2019t really improve storytelling, and in fact it\u2019s a misreading of what storytelling is all about.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 243 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CSE options chain for the new July 2014 contracts and identified the following call contract of particular interest.\nConsidering the fact that the $14.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.48% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.23% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the call contract example above is 31%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $13.49) to be 27%.

Arlo from Netgear is probably the most memorable solution I have tested, but even those can get to be a hassle when you are changing batteries every month.\nThe only real solution for those of you that are serious about security is to have a vendor come in and install a full on system or go with a DIY solution in a box. We have seen quite a few cameras from Foscam in the past, and one thing that has always been amazing is the setup process. Well, you are probably wondering what Foscam has to do with all of this and that all comes together as Huntvision is in some fashion a part of Foscam. I am not sure if one is the budget brand of the other, but they share many of the same devices.\nWith that said, the kit sent over for us to review is a four-camera kit consisting of a set of 720p cameras that connect to and get power from an NVR. This is simplified with each camera supporting PoE along with being IP66 weatherproof. We also have IR support with night vision range of 65ft along with the comfort of an NVR that runs 24/7 monitoring and alerting you.\nCompatibility includes Firefox, Safari, and IE8 and above. It does not support Microsoft's Edge browser. MSRP of the Huntvision HT-NR1108-XP-AB41 is $399.99 with a one-year warranty. As of this writing, Foscam was having a sale on Amazon where you can get this kit for $259.99.\nPackaging is quite vibrant for the Huntvision kit. We have an image of the complete setup on the front along with a full suite of marketing across the bottom.\nOn the backside, they go into a good bit of detail about the kit along with several diagrams outlining the NVR.\nTaking our first look at the NVR, I was surprised at how compact the unit was. Across the front, we have LEDs for power and each channel along with HDD and LAN.\nThe backside of the NVR is all business with eight channels of PoE for cameras and another for network connectivity. There is also an HDMI output for direct connections.\nInternally, the Huntvision comes with a Seagate Surveillance drive in the 1TB. For those of you that are serious, you will want to replace this with a WD Purple or larger Surveillance solution from Seagate.\nFor the direct connection aspect of the NVR, Huntvision included a mouse for navigating the interface.\nAbove, we have a first look at the cameras. They appear to be quite similar to the FI9900p I reviewed in January.\nTaking a closer look, each camera can swivel at the base and camera side with an elbow joint in the center.\nA full suite of IR LEDs enables this solution to get some rather impressive distance in night vision.\nWith this solution supporting PoE, we have just two wires coming out of the back of the camera. One being gigabit Ethernet and the other, the reset button.\nQuality is rather good for all of the cameras in the kit.

I put democracy in \"scare quotes\" -- literally here -- since it implies that democracy has one, unambiguous meaning: a system in which \"the people\" vote every few years, then recede, leaving their interests in the control of elected representatives and parties.\nThe prime suspect in this death by murder is populism. Panic among the respectable classes hit a new high after last Sunday's Italian election, when populist parties routed the traditional ones on the left and right. The New York Times called the vote \"a tidal turn of anti-immigrant, anti-European Union and anti-democratic fervour.\" I don't quite see why anti-democratic gets included in the list, since no party advocated eliminating elections.\nAcademic Yascha Mounk's new book is called The People vs. Democracy. He calls \"the very survival of liberal democracy in doubt \u2026 From Great Britain to the U.S. and from Germany to Hungary,\" at the hands of populism.\nWhat I fail to see is any inherent opposition between democracy and populism. Populism isn't the enemy of democracy; it springs from it and yearns for it. The \"people\" don't have to be bullied into \"democracy\" by bright journalists and academics. They're the ones who demanded and fought for it. Populism is democratic, that's why they call it populism.\nIn fact it's a kind of slander on the people to accuse them this way. They put up with an unconscionable amount of crap from our liberal forms of democracy. Take Greece, a good example of a battered populous.\nFor years it choked economically on measures imposed by unelected Eurocrats in Brussels. Then the people tossed out the old parties and elected a brand new one, Syriza. It had a tinge of populism. The EU got more vindictive.\nSo Syriza held a referendum asking the people, in effect: Are you serious? To everyone's surprise, they said they were -- but Syriza backed down anyway. So if you're the people, who you gonna turn to? There's despair there, disillusion, demoralizing emigration -- but, at least so far, no anti-democratic momentum.\nTake Honduras, where the last election was blatantly stolen (with U.S. and Canadian approval). Or Mexico, where Manuel Lopez Obrador is running a third time, having had victory swiped last time and likely to happen again, despite a huge lead. He's a \"fiery populist.\"\nWhat stands out in these cases, isn't that the people occasionally grow weary with the frustrations of elections, but that they stick with them doggedly despite all the bad experience. Why? They know the alternatives may be even worse. They don't require lectures, thank you.\nThe U.S. of Trump may be the best example of anti-democratic populism. He has disdain for elections and alternatives. (\"I alone can fix it.\") But it wasn't their fault -- or at least those in the rust belt states that gave him his victory -- that he was the only candidate who voiced their hard-won insight that \"free trade\" deals were vast deceptions destroying lives and communities. Many, probably most, would've voted for Bernie Sanders, had he been on offer.\nSome populist leaders are anti-democratic; some followers are racists and haters.

We are also fine-tuning designs to build a world-class integrated smart city spread over 2,000 acres near Shamshabad on the outskirts of Hyderabad, involving over Rs 40,000 crore spread over nearly 10 years.\nQ: But your cash reserves won\u2019t be enough to fund such a massive integrated city project, right?\nYes, we cannot fund such large projects solely through our internal accruals. For the first time since our inception, the group is considering raising funds from various external sources, which include private equity, public funds and global strategic and financial partnerships. It may take another 12-18 months for us to finalise the master plan for the global smart city project, for which we are roping in global architects, designers and agencies.\nQ: What are the targets for the group businesses?\nWe want to further consolidate ourselves in the key businesses of construction and cement. We are looking at adding cement capacities, both through greenfield projects and acquisitions, and are building a 1.2 million tonne port-based cement facility at Tuticorin involving Rs 230 crore of investment. Having a strong presence in the southern cement sector, we are now exploring acquisition opportunities in North, East and Western regions along with our partner CRH Plc. For construction of residential and commercial properties, we are exploring opportunities in tier-II cities across the country and looking to spread to cities such as Pune and Bhubaneswar.

Tony Guerrera, the co-chairman of the legislature's transportation committee, said that if the bill receives final approval, Tesla will be authorized to operate three stores to sell directly to customers throughout the state. Tesla is expected to create 25 to 75 jobs in Connecticut if those stores are opened. The high-performance, luxury cars are manufactured in California and can range in price from $70,000 to $140,000.\nThe bill was crafted to apply only to Tesla. The measure applies to companies that manufacture only electric cars, have no franchise agreements with any car dealer and sell only the cars that it manufactures.\nThe measure still requires approval by the Senate and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\nAn earlier version of the bill provided for five stores, but the compromise bill passed by the House on Thursday dropped that figure to three.\nRep. Thomas O'Dea, a New Canaan Republican who serves as the ranking member on the transportation committee, said he had \"gone full circle\" on the revised bill and has now become a supporter.\nThe dealerships lobbied heavily against the bill at the start of the session. In February, former state Sen. James Fleming, the president of the Connecticut Automotive Retailers Association, blasted the bill in front of the transportation committee.\n\"Granting Tesla a corporate loophole is a risky business and will circumvent long-standing consumer protections and jeopardize local businesses that have operated under these laws in good faith for over 40 years,\" Fleming said in his testimony.\nTesla lost $65 million in 2013, and the company is still not profitable, Fleming said. The company's chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has been quoted as saying that Tesla's first profitable year could be 2020.\nFleming says the Tesla cars are so expensive that only the richest citizens can purchase them.\n\"If Tesla folds tomorrow, there will be a few hundred people in Connecticut very disappointed, but the holders of most of these cars are your wealthiest 1 percent, and this is typically their third or fourth car,'' Fleming testified.\nThe automobile dealers, however, said Thursday that the situation had changed since Fleming's initial testimony. Fleming thanked legislators Thursday for the compromise, noting that Tesla will be limited to three retail outlets. In addition, Tesla will be required to comply with all motor vehicle and consumer protection laws.\nTesla hailed the House's passage on Thursday, saying it would help bring jobs to Connecticut. Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla's vice president for business development, said, \"We've worked with the dealers association, made compromises and now look forward to the Senate also recognizing that Tesla can bring revenue, ingenuity, and consumer choice to the state.\"\nBut Rep. Rob Sampson, a conservative Republican from Wolcott, said, \"This bill is a symptom of everything that is wrong with government. ... We"}

In fact, over the last 50 years, adding a unit of alternative energy to the grid displaced a mere one tenth of a unit of fossil fuel-fired power.

The transformation from hero to villain is quicker than ever thanks to the Bosman ruling, Man City silly money and players liking green. This time last season Nasri was embarking on a golden period which would peak with two solo efforts at home to Fulham in December and include numerous moments in which the Arsenal crest was clenched and kissed.\nOne year and an ignored contract offer later, Nasri couldn&apos;t give a f**k. The master of his future, he knows the opportunity to double his money is just around the corner and forgets the club which elevated him to such a prosperous position. Such is football. Who wouldn&apos;t want to earn twice as much elsewhere? It&apos;s too familiar to surprise. Especially at Arsenal.\nWhilst Nasri took the brunt of the fans frustration there was real discontent and conflicting feelings on other issues. Bored to f**k and out of patience with the Fabregas saga, there were chants of &apos;F**k off Cesc Fabregas&apos;. Some fans sang in support of Arsene, whilst others called for him and the board to be sacked.\nAt an uncertain time for the team on the pitch it would benefit if the fans were pulling in the same direction with the principal and simplistic aim of three points at the end of 90 minutes.\nWe&apos;re meant to be. That&apos;s our lot. Cesc gone, Nasri going, Wenger losing the plot and our seat at the Champions League table for four reserved by the media for Liverpool. It was therefore somewhat of a relief to get out of the papers and onto the pitch, where it was quickly evident that we aren&apos;t as bad as the summer of gloom was making out. Whilst far from great, Arsenal dominated the first half by keeping possession at will without the finishing touch in and around the box. Nothing new there. Until you look at the direct nature of new signing Gervinho and his eagerness to attack the full back and run behind and beyond the back line. For all the easy on the eye, but ultimately fruitless passing in front of defences over the last couple of seasons, the fore-headed one will add another dimension to Arsenal&apos;s game once he finds the same page as Van Persie and co. Yes, it was only against a relatively poor Newcastle side, but apparently we are only Arsenal now. We were pretty but toothless with an uncomfortable fragility born of last season. A season in which the horrors of the four-four draw in the same fixture still scare. This point felt a whole lot better, and in truth the fragility was due to memories of last season as opposed to anything evident on Saturday evening.\nSzczesny can play centre half and other signs of defensive stability.\nThe Arsenal fragility is based upon the fact conceding a goal out of nothing is always just around the corner, no matter how well we are playing or, in some instances last season, how great our"}

Meanwhile, Kevin, 31, went with a bright orange suit and black boat shoes.

It was that extensive network, she said, that helped investigators track Ambrose from Hennessy\u2019s bar to Pena\u2019s apartment in the Bunker Hill housing development.\nShe said the secrecy surrounding the program means the police don\u2019t have to publicly report who uses the cameras, under what circumstances, how long the footage is stored, and whether there is any internal review of the video monitoring.\nOakland, Calif., she said, has a privacy commission to oversee its police surveillance system.\nDavis said that when he led the department from 2006 to 2013, the large majority of cameras on city streets were operated by the Boston Transportation Department. Boston police have some of their own, he said, but typically use cameras from other city agencies, as well as private businesses, when investigating crimes.\nDavis was commissioner in 2013 when video footage released by the FBI helped authorities identify Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after they planted bombs at the Boston Marathon.\nResearchers said while cameras can be helpful in cracking such cases, evidence is mixed about whether they help deter crime.\nA 2010 report by M.

But eWEEK Labs believes that before this can happen, Symantec must straighten out its storage management lineup.\nAs it stands now, Symantec is chock-full of powerful storage technologies scattered among a number of different products, many of which were acquired during the last two years.\nOne of the biggest problems related to storage management today is that every storage tool that IT departments implement comes with a separate management console that needs to be mastered.\nAs a result, IT staff members are drowning in a sea of training manuals, and the process of documenting simple tasks is becoming a complex and never-ending chore.\nWhen Symantec unifies its management platform, IT managers will be able to back up and restore data while also being able to rebuild systems from a single console.\n/zimages/4/28571.gifClick here to read about Symantecs revamp of its consumer security package.\nWe dont expect a one-size-fits-all \u00fcber-interface to arrive any time soon, but we do believe that Symantec\u2014and other vendors, for that matter\u2014must ensure that its tools can communicate with each other.\nFor example, if a manager sees that an Enterprise Vault server is corrupted, it would be good if he or she could immediately see when the last backup took place and initiate a restore job without having to log in to a different console.\nIn the data protection arena, Symantec has two backup platforms for SMBs (small and midsize businesses), Backup Exec 10d and LiveState Recovery 6.0, which Symantec acquired with PowerQuest Corp. in December 2003.\nThese two backup platforms have complementary strengths. The Backup Exec platform has never been great at bare-metal restoration, nor has it been able to quickly rebuild systems corrupted by viruses, worms or user error.\nOn the other hand, LiveState Recovery\u2014which has its roots in PowerQuests Ghost imaging software\u2014can create point-in-time disk images that can be restored on demand.\nBackup Exec 10d is a market-leading backup platform for SMBs, and it is well-suited for data and application backup on tape media. With the addition of Continuous Protection Server, Symantec now has a solid disk-based backup solution with user-initiated file restores.\nBackup Exec 10d, bundled with the Continuous Protection Server, is priced at $995; the LiveState Recovery 6.0 platform costs $1,695 per server.\nUnification wont come easy, but Symantec needs to accomplish this as promptly as possible to make life easier for its clients.\nSenior Analyst Henry Baltazar can be reached at henry_baltazar@ziffdavis.com."}

Rahul and Arundhati Deo, who lived in Japan for 14 years, made it their staple too. So when they moved to Pune in 2008, what they missed most was the soft bread. When they couldn\u2019t find it anywhere, they simply decided to bake their own. Now, Pune has its own Tokyo Bakery.\nIt is true that Japanese breads are softer and lighter than the average European fare. Plus, they keep getting better every year. \u201cEvery year, dozens of new products are introduced. At last year\u2019s Curry Bread competition, bakers conjured an astonishing 130 versions of savoury bread. European countries now have popular Japanese bakeries,\u201d Rahul says. Pune has now put itself on that world bread map.\nIf this sounds too easy to be true, it\u2019s because it is. The Deos failed a few times before they could finally pull it off.\nThe couple lived in Tokyo while Rahul was working in the technology sector. By the time he was transferred to his company\u2019s Pune office, he was restless with his career. A casual conversation about missing their favourite breads at breakfast got the couple thinking. \u201cArundhati suggested I could fix my restlessness with a career change. And since we really missed our Japanese bread staples, she suggested I return to Japan to learn about baking bread,\u201d says Rahul. Arundhati, who gave up her job with the Life Insurance Corporation when they moved to Japan, had attended baking classes while there.\nKawakami has over 30 years\u2019 experience and operates bakeries that sell over Rs. 7 lakh worth of bread every day. He uses additive-free flour. He has also paved the way for women in baking. For one, he insisted that millers reduce the size of their traditional 25 kg sack size of flour so it was easier for women at his bakeries to pick them. Kawakami is known for his five-day program training aspiring bread-makers. Fortuitously, Kawakami decided to waive the $1000 fee for Rahul when he heard he had travelled from India to learn Japanese baking.\nIn five days, Rahul learned everything he could. He returned to Pune with extensive notes and shared what he had learned with Arundhati. But when the couple got down to baking bread in their apartment, they were in for a rude shock. They simply could not replicate the bread. For over a year, they tried everything they could \u2013 revising proportions, substituting ingredients and, sometimes, praying.

Additionally, interview sessions will allow teams to glean insight on the players who could become prized picks in April. But this week is just part of a larger scouting picture, and franchises' outlooks will shift when free agency opens in March.\n1. Cardinals - Nick Bosa, DE, Ohio State: This week will be the first opportunity for teams to get a look at Bosa since a core muscle injury shelved him for the season after three games, and he very well may firm up his status as the prohibitive favorite to be the top pick. His well-rounded athleticism and polished approach should set him apart from other top defenders in this class, though he can aid his case by displaying a bit more flexibility. Arizona is in need of cornerstones anywhere, and Bosa looks like the best bet in this class.\n2. 49ers - Quinnen Williams, DT, Alabama: The Outland Trophy winner would be the fourth defensive lineman to be drafted by San Francisco in the first round since 2015, but the 49ers shouldn't constrain themselves on this pick. By adding the consistently disruptive Williams, general manager John Lynch can take another step toward establishing a front capable of setting the tone both against the pass and run.\n3. Jets - Josh Allen, OLB/DE, Kentucky: Gang Green might also be an apt nickname for New York's free agency mind set, as general manager Mike Maccagnan has pledged to be \"active\" in using the more than $100 million in projected cap space at his disposal. The Jets, however, shouldn't let the possible acquisition of a pricy pass rusher preclude the possible selection of Allen, a sack artist whose burst and build should translate favorably to the NFL.\n4. Raiders - Ed Oliver, DT, Houston: If there weren't already enough intrigue surrounding a franchise that has three first-round draft picks, Jon Gruden amped up speculation about Oakland's plans late last week when he said there was \"a lot of potential for trades.\" For now, though, Oliver delivers on what the Raiders need most: pass-rushing prowess. The undersized-but-swift interior disruptor might end up one of the combine's biggest standouts, as many of his testing marks could be well ahead of his positional peers.\n5. Buccaneers - Jonah Williams, OT, Alabama: Even if Tampa Bay issues the franchise tag to left tackle Donovan Smith, Jameis Winston likely needs enhanced protection in order to thrive in Bruce Arians' downfield passing attack. Williams is perhaps the most polished pass protector in his class and would invigorate a dormant run game with his ability to consistently overpower defenders at the second level.\n6. Giants - Dwayne Haskins, QB, Ohio State: If New York is prepared to pull the trigger on Eli Manning's eventual heir, can general manager David Gettleman afford to stand pat in this slot? An arms race for the draft's top quarterbacks could force the Giants' hand into trading up, should they zero in on one target."}

The suggestion is perhaps the most ambitious \u2014 some say unrealistic \u2014 of 10 top recommendations outlined in a new transit report called Moving Forward released by the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce.\nThough costly, those intrigued by the idea argue it would still be cheaper than building a set of track.\nAnd for CSX, they argue a relocation could offer an opportunity for a new rail yard that would allow for future expansion, which is currently constrained because of nearby residential and industrial uses around the landlocked Radnor site. Freight that today passes through Nashville could be rerouted, relieving what is a CSX bottleneck.\nRadnor Yard, which was originally built by the old L&N Railroad, sees 150 rail cars and 450 trucks come through it weekly and freight totaling an estimated $12 million every day. It is the company\u2019s third largest classification rail yard behind facilities in Selkirk, N.Y., and Waycross, Ga.\n\u201cThis is not a quick fix. This is not a short-term option, but it could be a game-changing kind of play that makes sense for all parties,\u201d said Marc Hill, chief policy officer at the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce.\nMemphis, Boston, Denver and Houston are among the cities that are planning or have taken steps to move their rail facilities from urban center to other locations, according to the chamber report. The chamber\u2019s recommendation is for Middle Tennessee mayors, state officials and others to \u201csupport the planned efforts to discuss\u201d relocating Radnor Yard, not necessarily move ahead with it.\nSuch a move to an outer part of Middle Tennessee, the chamber says, could open existing CSX rail for commuter trains from Nashville to suburbs like Franklin, Murfreesboro and Gallatin.\nPrevious state-led reports have primarily looked at Smyrna as a possible relocation site for Radnor Yard to accommodate the Nissan automobile factory in Rutherford County.\nThis past year, as talks about transit in Middle Tennessee have picked up, state transportation officials and members of the Regional Transit Authority met with executives of Jacksonville, Fla.-based CSX and raised the possibility of the company sharing its freight rail for transit down the road.\nNashville transit options unveiled: Go big or go small?\nNot only did CSX reject that concept, but according to state officials, they also eliminated the possibility of using right-of-ways that run parallel to CSX tracks"}

The temperature is just two degrees above zero, yet there in the doorway of a city centre shop is someone covered by cardboard boxes, trying to get some sleep.\nI can\u2019t imagine they are getting any. It looks cold, uncomfortable and, quite frankly, degrading.\nYet to those of us who travel in and out of the city on a daily basis sights like these appear to have become more commonplace. It feels like homelessness is a growing problem, not just on the streets of Norwich, but nationally too.\nAcross the city there are a number of organisations tasked with combating this, identifying those at risk and helping them to put their lives back on track.\nOne of these is St Martin\u2019s Housing Trust, a dedicated homeless charity with, as I\u2019m soon to find out, specialist centres all over the city.\nThey also happen to be one of the beneficiaries of our Surviving Winter campaign, which aims to raise cash for those in poverty and in need of a helping hand during the winter months.\nAs thousands across the city start to wake or get that first cuppa of the day, work is already underway to provide support to those sleeping rough on the streets.\nSt Martin\u2019s form part of a relatively new scheme called Pathways. The aim of this has been to improve the success for those organisations that work with the homeless (and consequently the outcomes for the homeless themselves) by having them work more closely together.\nAnd a big part of this is the regular street counts which take place in the early hours of the day. These are not just about checking on the welfare of those sleeping rough, but then talking to them, understanding their situations and pinpointing them the best support. Much easier done when people from those organisations make those decisions together.\nThere is no typical morning for this team. They will come across alcoholics and drug addicts, people with severe mental ill health issues, former business people, family men and women whose relationships have broken down. Sadly sometimes they will come across a tragedy, other times they will almost certainly prevent one.\nOf those they meet some will want a helping hand, some will refuse. That\u2019s their choice and it has to be respected.\nTheir background doesn\u2019t matter to St Martin\u2019s, they believe that everyone deserves a chance and everyone should be treated with care and dignity. As any human would want to be treated.\nI speak to Jan Sheldon, chief executive of St Martin\u2019s, about the perception Norwich has a growing homeless problem and her response is something of a surprise.\nShe said: \u201cActual numbers of those sleeping rough in Norwich are falling and Pathways has had a big impact on that. We\u2019re bucking the national trend.\nThat said, the charity is still in the process of negotiating with Norwich City Council over the possibility of leasing a building from them to open a new 20-bed facility for the homeless, such is the demand on the current facilities they have.\nShe joined St Martin\u2019s just over a year ago and sees her role as not only being a champion for the charity, but also to stick up for the people they look after.\nShe added: \u201cFew people want to be living on the streets, it\u2019s important to remember that.

The nation's leading betting house, Ladbrokes, had already closed its book on Thursday's election and said it had begun paying out on a Labor victory.\nEven Hague, after presenting an ambitious plan Monday for his first days in office, had warned of the dangers of a Labor landslide.\n\"Well, he's trying hard,\" offered Tory voter Graham Gingell, 62.\nTrying to the bitter end in a race he is said to be losing by between 13 and 20 percentage points.\nHague is undaunted, as he has been throughout a campaign in which the bald politician in Savile Row suits is simultaneously mocked as Britain's oldest 40-year-old and portrayed in cartoons as a fetus.\nHe rattled off a litany of reasons that British voters should turn their backs on Labor after four years and return power to the party of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: Labor is all spin, no delivery. It has raised taxes, overwhelmed doctors and teachers with bureaucracy, gone soft on crime and neglected rural Britons, he said, barely drawing a breath. Now, it threatens to turn over more powers to Europeans in Brussels.\n\"We have two days to make sure we keep the pound,\" Hague said of the British currency, drawing applause in this Oxfordshire town's market square.\nIt was a mighty effort in a district of Parliament considered to be a safe Conservative seat until 1997, when Britain's third party, the Liberal Democrats, took it away in the electoral drubbing that ended 18 years of Tory rule.\nBut clearly it was not enough.\n\"I hope he knocks the Labor majority back,\" said Tory voter Peter Dixon, 47. \"Realistically, it's too big a hurdle for the Conservatives to get back in.

I took a deep breath and filled my lungs with the familiar sea air. Having grown up in Long Beach, New York, boardwalks are in my blood. Just the thought of walking a boardwalk causes my pulse to race. As a child, I walked the two miles of Long Beach boardwalk a thousand times and biked them, too, on my blue-and-white Schwinn.\nThe smell of hot dogs and French fries overwhelmed me, so we headed to the food stands.

This includes one of today\u2019s most talked about topics: free trade. To work appropriately, free trade must also be fair trade. Otherwise, one side of the trading partnership loses drastically.\nThere is a very fine line between fair and unfair trade, and finding a balance between the two can take some work. For example, Canada\u2019s domestic policy is to subsidize its lumber producers, thus they produce softwood lumber materials below market prices.\nThis becomes problematic when Canada exports its lumber to the global market, as it can leverage government subsidies to sell its lumber cheaper than other countries (like the United States), that instead rely on prevailing market rates to price their goods. This is simply unfair and gives Canada an artificial advantage over other producers.\nTo be clear, we are not advocating for special privileges or advantages for American companies. We firmly believe trade policy should exist to ensure that all parties \u2014 domestic and international \u2014 are competing on a level playing field. This fosters an economic system where companies thrive because of their own ingenuity, efficiency and skill.\nIn the case of softwood lumber, Canadian federal and provincial governments subsidize their lumber operations, sheltering producers from market lows and giving advantages during market highs.\nWhen the market is good, Canadian producers enjoy bigger profits and the increased ability to invest for the future. When markets are down, they face significantly less pressure to cut production or reduce labor hours.\nCanada maintains these advantages over American producers not because of more efficient lumber production or superior technologies, but because of the subsidies they receive from their government.\nOur experience as border-state senators has enabled us to witness firsthand how this dynamic causes real harm to American workers, companies and communities. We\u2019ve seen how a very innovative and competitive U.S. industry thrives in a free market, but when a foreign government subsidizes its businesses, U.S. workers and business owners lose their jobs and livelihoods.\nTo ensure that communities across the U.S. \u2014 from Missoula to Manchester \u2014 can compete fairly on the global stage, action is needed so that trade laws and agreements are properly enforced to fully address unfair practices. The U.S. must utilize tariffs or trade agreements to ensure everyone is using the same rulebook, allowing for an equal chance at success.\nInvestigations conducted this year by the U.S. Department of Commerce determined that the Canadian government subsidizes softwood lumber production and that Canadian exporters sell softwood lumber at less than fair value.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a preliminary finding that Canadian imports injure the American industry and will make a final determination this month. These findings are consistent with the United States\u2019 obligations under World Trade Organization rules.\nWe believe the tariff rates determined by the government are fair and simply offset the advantages our friends up north have enjoyed for years.\nThrough dozens of trips across the country, it\u2019s clear that the U.S. lumber industry\u2019s opportunity to compete is hampered only by its inability to match artificially low prices while maintaining fair wages for the over 350,000 individuals employed by this important U.S. industry.\nSubsidized Canadian lumber imports are a violation of our trade laws.

The company estimates that more than 80 million of the pacifiers combined have been sold since they were introduced.\nWith this pre-retail launch through NOVAPLUS, the more than 100,000 health care members that Novation serves, including members of Children's Hospital Association, are first to have access to a next generation of pacifier that is safer, more comfortable and lighter weight.\n\"Given our focus on pediatrics, working with Sandbox Medical was a logical step for NOVAPLUS, and we were pleased to be selected as the initial launch partner for products that build on Read's success over the past 20 years,\" said Brent Gee, Sr. Director, Strategic Programs, Novation. \"We have a long track record of responding to the hospital members we serve with the latest products that enhance the quality of care at compelling price points. In addition, our agreement with Sandbox Medical is another example of our strategy to support small businesses and minority enterprises.\"\nIn addition to pacifiers, NOVAPLUS offers 120 products across 17 pediatric categories, including cost-effective innovations from nationally recognized companies.\nThe JollyPop pacifier, which is 100 percent silicone and made in the USA, meets the one-piece construction requirements of the American Academy of Pediatrics. In recent product evaluations conducted by the company at 42 hospitals, the majority of participating nurses, mainly in the NICU, said they preferred the JollyPop pacifier over current products.\n\"The NOVAPLUS program fits perfectly with the JollyPop business model,\" said Read McCarty, co-founder and partner, Sandbox Medical. \"Rather than employ a sales force, we're promoting JollyPop through telemarketing and direct sampling, which allows us to pass along considerable savings to hospitals. The marketing and sales support we receive by being a NOVAPLUS supplier will help us promote the JollyPop directly to hospital's purchasing and clinical staff. This is a great opportunity for Sandbox Medical.\"\nMcCarty added: \"Innovative pediatric products don't mean anything until they can be routinely used in hospitals to help babies. Breaking into a market filled with large multi-national companies is extremely difficult. Just getting the attention of purchasing and clinical staff is enormously challenging. Working with Novation and NOVAPLUS gives us visibility and an increased level of creditability that is hugely valuable for a small company like SandBox Medical. Most importantly it will help us achieve our goal of fulfilling the unmet medical needs of premature and sick newborns.\"\nNOVAPLUS, Novation's private-label brand exclusively for members of VHA, UHC, Provista and Children's Hospital Association, delivers the best financial value and quality on the products and services that hospitals use most frequently.

I mean, when it comes to all the things that I really enjoy about my personal fishing time, the next six week or so is when it really all comes together for me.\nAs a guide and outfitter, almost every time I am on the water, the focus, of course, is on the paying client. But when the days get shorter, and I get some time on the water to myself, I just can\u2019t think of a season I enjoy more \u2026 except maybe for ice fishing, but that\u2019s another story for another day!\nLet\u2019s start with the fish. Pretty much every species of fish right now is putting on the feedbag, preparing for long, dark, cold days. Fish that spawn in the fall also have that to worry about, before the caloric needs take over, but that also helps us as anglers. No matter if you are targeting fish on a lake, river or stream, the bite is on and the waterways are very inviting.\nOn Flathead Lake and in the river as well, when it comes to lake trout and lake whitefish, it is all about the pre-spawn right now. Lots of male lakers are moving in shallow along the shorelines, staking their territory and waiting for the females to show up. This is a good time for aggressive tactics, trolling noisy flashy baits that will make them think they are being invaded. If fishing from shore, or tossing lures up onto shoreline structure, think big, noisy spinners, like the #5 Vibrax and large Panther Martins. Big blades get big bites!\nLake whitefish are really not feeding so much right now, but as they move into the river to stake out the spawning beds, they will protect those beds now through December. When fishing from shore, or by vessel, remember that small baits floated through their beds will get a reaction bite. Small crawdad imitators, tube jigs such as the Gitzits and small, dark colored jigs with a chunk of plastic are the ticket.\nLike to fish for perch? You can\u2019t go wrong right now with horizontal crayfish or minnow imitations on lakes such as Lake Mary Ronan, Middle Thompson or Lower Stillwater, to name just a few. Remember, juvenile yellow perch are now in the 1 to 1.5 inch range, so look like that! On lakes where there are abundant crayfish, perch will be gorging on them as well as small bluegill and sunfish where present.\nSmallmouth bass your thing? As the surface temps cool, these fighters will begin their trek to their deeper, wintering grounds. Probe these areas out to about 50 feet deep with drop shot rigs, using enough weight to keep your line vertical and your weight just touching bottom. Small tubes, minnow imitators and chunks of crawler rigged 12-18 inches above the weight will put you in the strike zone. You will catch just about anything in the system this way, so enjoy a multi-species day!\nSalmon die-hards are right in the middle of snagging season (where allowed), so anglers are fishing mostly for two and three year old fish, smaller but more aggressive now as they are the \u201cbig fish\u201d in any given system. Some lakes like Swan Lake seem to have a late spawn as fish need some rain to help raise the water levels in the creeks they spawn in, so concentrate off the mouths and be ready for not just salmon action, but the large predator fish as well.

{"idx": "16336", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Make your own checks to pay employees according to your wage agreement.\nWhen employees perform work for their employers, the U.S. Department of Labor requires the small business owner to pay the employees accordingly. Giving employees a payroll check for services rendered shows proof of payment, as opposed to just handing out cash. Some employers outsource their payroll processing tasks to a payroll service provider. That company makes the checks and sends them to the employer. As an employer, you can make your own payroll checks.\nOrder checks from the bank where you have your payroll account, or see if an office supply store offers cheaper payroll checks. Hand-write these types of payroll checks. The check should include the company name, check number, check date, net pay amount, the employee's name and possibly address, and the bank that the check is drawn on.\nIf your state requires you to give employees a pay stub, you can order preprinted payroll checks with the stub attached from a stationery shop. Hand-write these types of checks, print them on a typewriter or use payroll software. If you use your bank's checks, you can make your own pay stub using a spreadsheet program.\nBuy payroll software to create payroll checks. This method is particularly useful if your payroll includes more than 10 employees. Payroll software eliminates manual processing. The software calculates wage and deductions and creates paychecks and pay stubs.\nSmall companies with relatively straightforward payroll processing tasks can use software such as QuickBooks. Medium-sized companies with multi-state and multiple pay frequencies can use software such as Ultimate Software. Larger organization with more complex payroll requirements including timekeeping importation and piece rate payments might use FACT software.\nOrder blank payroll checks and the special toner used to print these checks, typically from the payroll software company.

Even more importantly, they have figured out how to repair that pathway and restore normal neurological function in certain animal models.\n\"For the first time we've been able to repair dopaminergic neurons, the specific cells that are damaged in Parkinson's disease,\" says Whitehead Member and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Susan Lindquist, senior author on the paper that will be published June 22 online in Science.\nIn 2003, researchers in the Lindquist lab described using yeast cells as \"living test tubes\" in which they could study Parkinson's. A paper published in Science reported that when a Parkinson's-related protein called alpha-synuclein was over-expressed in these cells, clumps of misshapen proteins gathered near the membrane, and in many cases the cells either became sick or died.\nAaron Gitler and Anil Cashikar, postdoctoral researchers in the Lindquist lab, decided to follow up on these results by asking a simple question: Is it possible to rescue these cells when an over-expression of alpha-synuclein would normally make them sick?\nThey began with an array of yeast cells in which each cell over-expressed one particular gene. This array, prepared by scientists at the Harvard Institute of Proteomics, covers the entire yeast genome. All cells were also infected with alpha-synuclein. They reasoned that if they identified genes whose over-expression rescued a cell, that would tell them something about how alpha-synuclein made the cell sick in the first place.\nMost of the proteins that they identified pointed to a pathway that involves two cellular organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. The ER is the cell's protein factory, where proteins assume their requisite shapes. Once a protein has properly folded, it is trafficked over to the Golgi, where it is fine-tuned and further prepared for its designated task.\nWorking with Antony Cooper from the University of Missouri, Kansas City, Lindquist's team demonstrated that when alpha-synuclein becomes mutated and clumps at the cell surface, it manages to drag away a protein that helps transport between the ER and the Golgi. Proteins are blocked from navigating this crucial route, and the cell dies.\nThis isn't just a general toxic effect caused by any misfolded protein. It is specific to alpha-synuclein, the protein associated with Parkinson's Disease.\n\"All this was done in yeast,\" says Gitler. \"Our next goal was to find out what this told us about actual neurons.\"\nIf mutations of alpha-synuclein dragged the ER/Golgi transport protein away from doing its job, as the yeast research indicated, then cell death might be averted simply by increasing the levels of this transport protein. Working with colleagues at University of Pennsylvania, University of Alabama, and Purdue University, the consortium tested this hypothesis in the fruit fly, C. elegans worm, and in neurons culled from rats\u2014all"}

This roughly 30% decline in value for the world\u2019s largest asset manager is primarily due to industry-wide headwinds from the ongoing price wars, as the secular trend of investors shifting their cash to low-cost ETFs from actively-managed fund offerings eats into the bottom line. Fidelity\u2019s decision to introduce a line of zero-fee index fund offerings in August marked the beginning of a new chapter in the asset management industry, and will put pressure on already dwindling profit margins for all incumbents going forward.\nBut the sell-off in BlackRock\u2019s shares over recent weeks has been overdone \u2013 especially the 7% slump earlier this week following a downgrade in its price estimate by Morgan Stanley (it should be noted that Morgan Stanley still maintains a price target of $600 for BlackRock\u2019s shares). The sell-off looks overdone, and presents an attractive upside opportunity ahead of a potentially strong Q3 earnings announcement slated for Tuesday, October 16. We expect BlackRock to report revenues of $3.7 billion for the quarter, and an EPS figure of $7 (ahead of consensus revenue and EPS figures of $3.68 billion and $6.93 respectively), and maintain a $550 price estimate for BlackRock\u2019s shares as detailed in our interactive model for the company. We detail our key expectations below.\nBlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with $6.3 trillion in assets under management at the end of Q2 2018. The company saw its asset base shrink slightly in Q2 despite decent inflows for the period due to unfavorable changes in valuation across asset classes. However, with the equity market resuming its rally in Q3, and with valuations in debt markets also being upbeat, BlackRock is expected to report a notable uptick in total AUM this time around.\nAs has been seen over recent years, the single biggest driver of growth in AUM should remain BlackRock\u2019s iShares exchange-traded fund offerings \u2013 especially equity iShares. According to data compiled by ETF.com, BlackRock\u2019s total U.S.-listed ETFs grew from $1.37 trillion in size at the end of June 2018 to almost $1.45 trillion by the end of September \u2013 a sequential increase of over 5%. Although Fidelity\u2019s zero-fee passive funds likely led to some outflows from corresponding offerings from BlackRock, we expect the impact of this on the total AUM to be mitigated by the ongoing trend of inflows into passively-managed funds over recent quarters.\nBased on this, we estimate BlackRock\u2019s total asset base to increase from $6.3 trillion at the end of Q2 2018 to $6.35 trillion at the end of Q3 2018. Taken together with a small decline in fees as a percentage of AUM, this should result in BlackRock\u2019s advisory fees increasing slightly from $2.94 billion in the previous quarter to $2.95 billion now. For full-year 2018, we expect advisory fees to cross $12 billion as detailed in the chart below.\nAs an improvement in advisory fees and continued growth in revenues from BlackRock Solutions (prim"}

{"idx": "16357", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Analysts predict that Apple alone could sell 28 million iPad tablets in 2011. That doesn't even take the Samsung Galaxy Tab, or the rest of the upcoming tablets expected in the next few months into consideration, and doesn't bode well for other mobile computing platforms. The netbook in particular will be the primary victim of the rise of the tablet, and will quickly be rendered obsolete.\nThe primary advantages of a netbook--when compared with larger notebook computers--are size, weight, and battery life. Netbooks are more diminutive and manage to squeeze the guts of the computer into a case generally smaller than a sheet of paper and not much thicker than a standard paperback novel when closed.\nWith the smaller physical dimensions comes a significantly lower weight as well. The average weight of netbooks ranges from two to four pounds, or about half the weight of many notebook computers. A handicap of the netbook is that it lacks an internal DVD drive in order to make the smaller case and lighter weight possible.\nOne of the biggest advantages of a netbook, though, is the extended battery life. While notebooks may last only a couple hours on a fully-charged battery, a netbook can typically make it through a full business day on a single charge.\nHowever, the biggest draw of netbooks is arguably price. With prices starting in the $200 range, and netbooks available from wireless carriers with subsidized pricing as low as $50 in exchange for a commitment to a data plan, netbooks provide a much cheaper point of entry than the traditional notebook or desktop PCs.\nThat explains the lure or a netbook when compared to a notebook, but how does the netbook stack up against the tablet? Well, the answer to that question is largely subjective and introduces a new question: what are you looking for in a mobile computing platform?\nSome will argue that the netbook still holds an advantage in that it has USB ports, larger hard drive storage capacity, and a full operating system. All of those are advantages, or possibly even deal-breakers depending on what your mobile computing needs are. The ability to simply install and run the various software applications used on a standard Windows PC rather than having to adapt to a mobile OS app culture has its benefits.\nThe Apple iPad has a larger footprint than many netbooks, but because it is a flat-panel form factor the thickness is less. At only half an inch thick, and weighing it at a pound and a half, the iPad bests netbooks in the size and weight categories.\nThe iPad boasts up to 10 hours of battery life--superior to all but the most elite netbooks. The flat touchscreen interface is much more suited for computing on the go than the netbook form factor that requires folding the computer open and involves two hands for most tasks.\nWith prices that start at $499 for the base model, though, the iPad is significantly more expensive than most netbooks. However, an armada of tablets is on the horizon built on Android, WebOS, and even Windows 7--and those may have lower prices, or use the carrier-subsidy model familiar to smartphones and netbooks now.\nSome aspects of the tablet require users to adapt to new ways of embracing mobile computing, and a culture shift from looking at it as just another portable computer form factor. That said, tablets offer most, if not all, of the advantages of netbooks, and add in some new benefits as well, making it a more compelling mobile computing platform than netbooks in many cases, and making the concept of the netbook somewhat obsolete."}

The note said GM executives point to recent tests conducted with self-driving cars in complex urban environments like San Francisco as proof that they are nearing commercial launch. GM also recently unveiled its first commercial design for an autonomous car, dubbed the Cruise Generation 3.\nDeutsche's note also predicted that GM will leverage its autonomous vehicles to take a sizeable chunk of the mobility services market. Once the Generation 3 is fully ready for commercial launch and production, GM plans to use it for commercial fleets that can provide mobility services, including ride-hailing. Deutsche said that the introduction of autonomous vehicles will lead to an explosion in the market for these services.\nUp to 60% of American households in cities could find it more convenient (and cheaper) to use autonomous mobility services than owning a vehicle, according to Rod Lache, the note's author. Urban households make up the majority of the US population, according to the US Census Bureau.\nThat will drive significant growth in these services, which will account for 10% of all vehicle miles driven in the US by 2030, up from 2% in 2025, Lache predicted.\nLache predicts GM could grab as much as 17.5% of the US market for autonomous mobility services. GM itself has forecast that the global market for autonomous mobility services could be worth up to $7 trillion.\nPutting self-driving cars on the road. The Generation 3 already features all of the hardware necessary for a self-driving car, according to GM. However, its software still needs further testing and development before it can handle any scenario on the road and fully replace a human driver.\nThe regulatory environment for self-driving cars in the US remains unclear. The Senate is set to take up legislation passed by the House that would turn the Department of Transportation's recently released self-driving car guidelines into legally enforceable regulations. However, the guidelines are littered with vague language, and, with no clear legal precedent for how regulators will enforce them, could lead to further confusion for automakers.\nLastly, once GM puts autonomous cars on the road, it will face steep competition. Other automakers, including Ford and Daimler, are also exploring this opportunity. Those companies are also spending heavily to accelerate their own autonomous ride-hailing services, and competition among these players will be intense.\nCLOUD SOFTWARE COMPANIES' AUTOMOTIVE OPPORTUNITY: Major enterprise software analytics vendors such as Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR, and Teradata have a huge opportunity in the connected, electric vehicle (EV) market, according to a new report from financial services firm Cowen & Co.\nThe report argues that adoption of electric vehicles will be faster than the market currently expects.

Wi-LAN signs agreements allowing use of its technology by communications and consumer electronics companies, while enforcing its patents through the courts.\nWi-LAN started life in 1992 and became an exemplar of the tech bubble, riding its wireless technology up to an $80 share price in 2000 before plummeting by 90 per cent within the year. In 2006, the company refocused solely on turning its patents into cash flow. Some brand Wi-LAN a \"patent troll,\" for making money off of technology it has no intention of commercializing. But the company is distinct for its high-quality portfolio, much of which it invented itself.\nThe company's chosen direction requires the favour of the courts, which means its stock price is aligned to the whims of the legal system. This year, Texas juries have not been kind to Wi-LAN. In July, the company lost a lawsuit against a group of device makers over wireless data processing patents. The stock dove by more than 30 per cent. Then in October, jurors decided that Apple Inc. had not illegally used Wi-LAN's communications technology in its devices.\n\"I thought it was a slam dunk,\" Mr. Takacsy said. \"Even Apple couldn't believe it.\" Wi-LAN had first launched a wave of lawsuits in 2011 against seven companies.

Christopher Kingston, has announced the appointment of Adam Scheier as Interim Head Football Coach. The decision comes after Dave Clawson agreed to become the head football coach at Wake Forest University Tuesday. Scheier will lead the Falcons in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl on Dec. 26.\nScheier is in his fifth season at Bowling Green, previously serving as the special teams coordinator while overseeing the tight ends. Scheier\u2019s special teams units have been among the best in the Mid-American Conference during the past five seasons.\nHis special teams unit has been one of the most aggressive and innovative in the MAC, blocking 16 kicks, returning three kicks and four punts for touchdowns, while executing several fake punts to perfection. Scheier has produced six all-MAC special teams performers; punter Brian Wright (2010 second team), punt returner Eugene Cooper (2010 second team), kick returner BooBoo Gates (2011 second team), punter Brian Schmiedebusch (2011 first team and 2012 second team) and punt returner Ryan Burbrink (2013 second team).\nHis tight ends have become one of the most dynamic aspects of the Falcon offense over the past several years, proving valuable in the run and pass game. Tight end Alex Bayer, a third team all-MAC performer, is second on the team with 34 receptions. All three tight ends, including Tyler Beck and Chris Pohlman, are used in all aspects of the Falcon offense. The trio has combined for 48 catches and six touchdowns this season. Scheier has produced all-MAC tight ends on three occasions, with Jimmy Scheidler (2009 second team) and Alex Bayer (2012 second team and 2013 third team) both being recognized during his tenure.\nClawson departs Bowling Green after five seasons as the head coach. He compiled a 32-31 record at BGSU and led the Falcons to three bowl appearances in five seasons. Clawson also brought Bowling Green their first MAC Championship since 1992, when the Falcons defeated Northern Illinois 47-27 Friday night at Ford Field.\nIn his first season at Bowling Green, Clawson led the Falcons to a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl with a 7-6 record. Clawson saw his quarterback, Tyler Sheehan, set a school-record with 4,051 yards passing. Sheehan\u2019s main target, Freddie Barnes, set an NCAA record with 155 receptions in 2009.\nGoing into 2010, Clawson and his staff knew they had an arduous rebuilding task. The Falcons went just 7-17 over the next two years, but the foundation was in place for sustained success. In 2012, Bowling Green went 8-5, advancing to the Military Bowl.\nClawson and the Falcons found more success in 2013, validating the rebuilding process. Bowling Green began the season 5-1, with wins over Tulsa and Kent State, who had each won 10-plus games in 2012. But, after two midseason losses by a combined four points, the Falcons had their backs against the wall. Bowling Green would respond, winning the final four games to win the MAC East Division and advance to"}

The Korean brand has every intention of making cars that get your blood pumping, signing on the former head of BMW\u2019s famous M division to create a similar program at Hyundai, somewhat hilariously dubbed N. Apparently it refers to Namyang, the brand\u2019s R&D facility in Korea, but still\u2026 it\u2019s a bit on the nose.\nUntil these red hot Hyundais make their way to the States later this year or early next, though, what are value-conscious buyers with a need for speed to do? There are a plethora of hot hatchbacks and sedans available for sub-$30,000, but for under $25,000, the well runs dry. The Honda Civic Hatchback Sport is a solid choice, but only if you can live with cloth seats, no touchscreen infotainment, and minimal safety technology.\nEnter: the 2017 Hyundai Elantra Sport, a handsome compact sedan with technology, equipment, looks, and power to appease those of us with right feet made of lead, and a price that anyone can get behind.\nThe awesome LED taillights and rear splitter coupled with a dual-tip exhaust help liven up a design that initially left me feeling very cold.\nOne of my biggest criticisms of the base Elantra is that the styling took a major step backwards. Nobody can accuse this little sedan of being ugly, but in comparison to the swoopy, elegant previous generation, it\u2019s like Hyundai\u2019s design team collectively took a Xanax and phoned it in this time around.\nThankfully, sporty accents make pretty much everything look better, and while the base Elantra channels Audi A3 styling cues, the Sport is all S3, from the bigger, more aggressive grille to the tidy sedan proportions with a big passenger compartment.\nThe Sport trim is handsomely equipped, including leather-trimmed sport seats with a unique embossing and red accent stitching and a flat-bottomed steering wheel.\nI\u2019m a big fan of the revised front end, with bigger air dams and a somewhat cheeky \u201cTurbo\u201d badge nestled in between the grille slats, but where the Elantra Sport gets real interesting is the rear end. The wide LED taillights are some of the coolest I\u2019ve seen on an economy car, and a largely useless but still cool rear splitter and dual exhaust pipes give this Korean compact a rally car look. The wheels are awesome too, with a two-tone tuning fork design and several interspersed spokes that give this value player some serious street cred.\nInside, the Elantra gets an upgrade too, with an all-black leather interior that features sport seats with red accent stitching and a flat-bottomed steering wheel that\u2019s just the right size and thickness for a car with sporting pretentions.\nUnlike with the previous generation Elantra, the Sport trim gets more than just a visual upgrade this time around.

The headline event was a 30,000-person march in San Francisco, with all the pageantry and noise you\u2019d expect.\nHere in Denver, we participated as well, but there were no huge banners, no dramatic floats, no march at all.\nInstead, there were crucial conversations. And that could change everything.\nLabor leaders understand the impacts of climate change. We know it\u2019s real, it\u2019s man made, it\u2019s an existential threat to our planet and it\u2019s here now. But we also know that the fastest and most equitable way to address climate change is for labor to be at the center of creating solutions that reduce emissions while investing in our communities so that we can maintain and create high-wage union jobs.\nIt\u2019s no secret, historically, there have been issues between labor and environmentalists. There have been a few transactional partnerships on specific issues, but distrust has remained. It\u2019s understandable, as the climate movement is often focused on hastening a transition away from fossil fuels, while unions are concerned with the welfare of the workers whose livelihoods are on the line.\nBut last month, we sat down together for the Colorado Climate, Jobs and Justice Summit. And one after another, union members in this state told our stories. We talked about the importance of not only taking care of the climate, but also taking care of the workers and communities who currently depend on the fossil fuel industry. For many in the environmental community, it was the first time they had heard those stories, which highlighted that we as a society cannot forget those who performed a lifetime of difficult and dangerous work to power America.\nAnd in turn, it was the first time many workers got to interact face-to-face with folks from the environmental movement and learn how diverse and compassionate its members could be.\nI was a mediator for a decade before I joined the labor movement, and I\u2019ve seen first hand the power of dialogue \u2014 real dialogue where people speak candidly and feel authentically listened to \u2014 to build relationships and achieve transformational results. I believe participants at both the individual and movement levels have started down the path to reaping the rewards of those conversations. It\u2019s something new \u2014 the foundation for doing something powerful at the state capitol and at the ballot box.\nThe vehicle for a lasting partnership between labor, environment, racial justice, economic justice, and faith groups already exists in the form of the Peoples Climate Movement, the coalition organization that organized the Rise events around the country. By providing us the opportunity to have this summit, the Peoples Climate Movement forced all of us in labor to take a hard look at how we want to approach the environmental space.\nDid we want to spend our time blocking bills in the legislature that reduce carbon emissions and renewable energy? Or did we want to lead on ensuring that we have a just and equitable transition for fossil fuel dependent workers and creating family-sustaining, union jobs in the new green economy?\nIf all of the groups in this coalition commit to authentically listening to each other and collaborating together, the future possibilities for Colorado are enormous.\nImagine a comprehensive climate and jobs"}

If you see turkeys in another county, print off a second form and fill it out. Record each sighting or group of turkeys as separate observations. Do not combine all turkeys that you see in a day or on multiple days and report them as a single observation.\nTry to avoid reporting the same turkeys in the same area more than once.\nRemember to note hens that do not have poults as well as those that do. This is extremely important in determining the overall reproductive success for the year.\nWhile you\u2019re at it, take note and report any quail sightings you may have during your efforts.\nThe information gathered during this process allows state biologists to calculate the many factors vital to sound turkey management. Those factors include the average brood size, percentage of hens with young and without, gobbler to hen ratio and overall numbers of turkeys. When this information is combined with annual hunter harvest data, the agency is able to make accurate scientific recommendations to the General Assembly as it works to pass hunting regulations that are appropriate for our current biological situation.\nIf you have any questions about this annual project or your involvement in it, contact the survey coordinator at the address above, by phone at 803-734-8738 or email ruthc@dnr.sc.gov.\nBrad Harvey is a freelance writer in Clover.

The Browns were going to finish in last place with Johnson and Kretlow, or with Trucks and Elliott, but the main thing for Veeck was that they just finish. That made the $75,000 that Detroit sent along with Johnson and Kretlow paramount.\nSo finish the '53 season the St. Louis Browns did, on a late September day before 3,000 fans. The $75,000 that Veeck got from Detroit in June was gone, and there were not enough baseballs for the team to take batting practice before that last game. And then the Browns were gone, too, sold off to a Baltimore group and renamed the Orioles in time for the '54 season.\nOnly a masochist could reminisce about Veeck's three seasons in St. Louis--292 losses, two last-place finishes and one next-to-last--but baseball's Barnum will be remembered more for what he did on one day in that town than for the pennants won and attendance records set with the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago White Sox.\nIn recent years, Veeck would turn sideways when he saw me coming. \"Tell me the midget story,\" I would request, to which he would say: \"Again?\"\nBut he loved telling how he had signed 3-foot 7-inch, 65-pound Eddie Gaedel to a contract, given him a uniform with fraction number \"1 8\" on the back and sent him to the plate against the Tigers on Aug. 19, 1951.\nVeeck told the Gaedel story the same way every time, which probably meant that the facts were intact. Despite having been there, in a crowd of 18,000, the particulars were still a blur to me, other than remembering that Gaedel popped out of a giant cake between games of a doubleheader and walked on four pitches by Detroit's Bob (Sugar) Cain to lead off the second game. But in the re-telling, Veeck spared no small detail, including the intrigue of sneaking Gaedel into the ballpark with only a few people knowing.\nYears ago, Charlie (King Kong) Keller, the retired Yankee outfielder, digressed during an interview about his standardbred horse breeding farm to say that he had been on the Detroit bench the day Gaedel batted. Bothered by a chronic sore back, Keller was playing out the string as a pinch-hitter for the Tigers.\n\"The Tigers stayed at a hotel not far from the St. Louis ballpark,\" Keller said. \"Rumors were flying around the lobby that Sunday morning that Veeck was going to do something really crazy.

{"idx": "16384", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Nokia has developed a prototype of its N900 smartphone that lets you feel the texture of icons on the screen \u2013 a technology that would add a whole new dimension to touchscreen apps.\nThis week, Nokia researcher Piers Andrew showed how the technology could give each icon its own feel or add surface texture to photographs. \u201cThe idea is to have everything on a touchscreen give tactile feedback,\u201d Andrew says.\nThe technology is based on an effect called electrovibration, in which touch receptors in the skin can be fooled into perceiving texture when you swipe a fingertip across an insulating layer above a metal surface carrying an alternating voltage. The higher the frequency of that alternating voltage, the smoother the texture feels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effect that\u2019s been known about since the 1950s,\u201d says Andrew. Often when electrical equipment was poorly earthed, people could feel a mysterious rough surface as they swept a fingertip across a visibly smooth, insulator-coated metal surface carrying a varying voltage (Science, DOI&colon; 10.1126/science.118.3062.277).\nThe effect is thought to be due to the varying electrostatic attraction between the metal and the deeper, liquid-rich conducting layers of the skin \u2013 an effect which changes the perceived friction level.\nTo mimic this is in a touchscreen phone, Nokia placed two thin layers above the LCD display&colon; the first a transparent conductor, indium tin oxide, and the second a transparent insulator, hafnium oxide. When the user cradles the phone in one hand and touches the screen with the fingers of their other hand, they effectively create a closed circuit. If the indium tin oxide is excited at frequencies between 50 and 200 hertz, the finger above the touchscreen is attracted towards the screen with varying strength, generating the textured effect.\nYou will only feel texture if you move the finger across the surface, and since the prototype can generate just one frequency at a time, only one on-screen texture can be felt at any moment. To enable multitouch \u2013 with different fingers simultaneously experiencing different textures on the display \u2013 Nokia will have to modify the system to apply different frequencies to different areas of the screen.\nNokia has filed a patent on its ideas, but Andrew admits the concept still needs some work. \u201cThis is not necessarily the most attractive sensation for some people,\u201d he says.\nThe cellphone manufacturer is not alone in its pursuit of texture for touchscreens. Academic groups around the world are exploring similar ideas, and Toshiba is also developing electrostatic displays in collaboration with Finnish start-up Senseg of Helsinki.\nWhen will Nokia launch this phone? \u201cThis interface is still very much in the research phase. The ultimate goal is to integrate the research into future Nokia devices \u2013 but it\u2019s too early to say when,\u201d says Frederique Slezak, a Nokia spokeswoman.\nYon Visell, a specialist in tactile interfaces at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, looks forward to such capability&colon; \u201cTactile feedback is the most glaringly omitted dimension in touchscreen devices like the Apple iPhone or iPad. The device can feel what we\u2019re touching, but we can\u2019t,\u201d he says."}

It took Swiss engineers 14 years to dig the world\u2019s longest rail tunnel, the 57-kilometre Gotthard Base Tunnel under the Alps. It was finished in 2010, but construction began in 1996.\nThe Zambian mole rat doesn\u2019t dig all the way through mountain ranges, but it does dig some of the longest tunnels in the natural world, and the longest of any non-human mammal. A single underground colony can stretch for 2.8 kilometres. Yet on average, each colony contains just nine or 10 mole rats. These guys are digging machines.\nThe Zambian mole rat is related to the famous naked mole rat, one of only two mammals to live in \u201ceusocial\u201d colonies&colon; like honeybees and termites, a single queen does all the breeding and the others work to maintain the colony. The other eusocial mammal is the Damaraland mole rat.\nZambian mole rats are less willing to sacrifice their own breeding rights for the good of the colony \u2013 colonies can have several breeding females \u2013 but they are still highly cooperative. Jan \u0160kl\u00edba of the University of South Bohemia in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, the Czech Republic, and colleagues have carried out the first detailed study of wild colonies to find out how their societies work.\nThey mapped out 16 colonies. On average, each had 1.2 kilometres of tunnels and covered an area of 6919 square metres. For comparison, the largest known badger sett spanned just 879 metres. The Zambian mole rats\u2019 tunnels were densely branched, particularly around the central nest where the breeding pair lived.\nYet each colony had on average 9.7 mole rats, each of which must have done an awful lot of digging. Naked mole rats produce tunnels of similar lengths, but their colonies average 80 individuals, which gives them an obvious numerical advantage.\nMole rats vary widely in how social they are, from the eusocial naked mole rats to the solitary small dune mole rat. According to Paul Sherman of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, species living in harsh environments are more social. If the ground is hard to dig and food sources are widely separated, mole rats can only survive in groups.\nThe Zambian mole rats fit this to a tee, Sherman says. \u0160kl\u00edba found that the soil in the Zambian mole rats\u2019 habitat was easier to dig than in the naked mole rats\u2019 habitat. What\u2019s more, although the tubers eaten by the mole rats were widely spaced, there were lots of them.\nSo the Zambian mole rats live in a moderately tough environment, but not as tough as the naked mole rats. In line with that, they\u2019re social but not eusocial.\n\u0160kl\u00edba also found evidence that the Zambian mole rats might be unusually friendly towards their neighbours. Nine of the colonies had a tunnel connecting them to one or two neighbouring colonies. In one case, four colonies were linked together in a daisy chain spanning 7.2 kilometres of tunnels.\nMole rat colonies are generally isolated from one another, but the Zambian mole rats may be an exception. Unpublished telemetry data suggests that members of one colony visited neighbouring colonies. Are they finding mates, socialising, or stealing food from rivals? Sherman says it\u2019s also possible"}

But as others have pointed out since the attorney general announced Thursday that he would resign, Holder\u2019s work on civil liberties has been far less inspiring. Holder will leave his successor with the task of explaining and justifying many controversial policies. Here are four of the most significant civil liberties failures of Eric Holder\u2019s time as America\u2019s top attorney.\nProsecuting leakers and whistleblowers: It\u2019s not just Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning \u2013 the Obama administration has prosecuted more people under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other previous administrations combined. Recent attempts at reform have still left would-be whistleblowers afraid of retaliation, and some agencies have revised official policies to restrict conversations with journalists about even the most basic things.\nAs the White House hints at a timetable for replacing Attorney General Eric Holder, Steve Kornacki\u2019s panelists look at who would want the job and what\u2019s in store for the position during Pres. Obama\u2019s last two years.\nWhoever takes the reins from Holder also will have to decide what to do about New York Times reporter James Risen, who the Justice Department is still trying to compel to testify about a confidential source. Holder said in early September that Risen would not face jail time, but the DOJ has not indicated that it plans to change course about forcing him to testify.\nSpying on journalists: Holder\u2019s DOJ hasn\u2019t just tried to force journalists to hand over information about sources. In May 2013, the Associated Press revealed that the Justice Department had spied on some of its reporters by collecting phone records, ostensibly because it was needed for an investigation into leaks. And in addition to the AP spying, the DOJ also took the phone records of a Fox News reporter. Only weeks later, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden would reveal much more widespread government spying, some of which is conducted by agencies like the FBI, which function under the authority of the Justice Department.\nGuantanamo Bay is still open, and dozens of prisoners remain untried: Holder did try to get the Justice Department involved in Guantanamo cases, but congressional fear-mongering and opposition sank his plan to bring some detainees to the United States for trial back in 2010. The U.S. has successfully prosecuted nearly 500 people in federal courts since 9/11, but only six military commission convictions have been upheld. Meanwhile, military commissions for those accused of plotting 9/11 and the bombing of the USS Cole continue to drag on.\nHolder\u2019s hands been effectively tied against prosecution in American courts, but that is not the only avenue for reducing Guantanamo\u2019s population. Last year, the DOJ released a document with recommendations from an Obama administration task force for the men still held at the island prison. The White House has released 17 detainees in the past year, and another 79 are approved to leave Guantanamo Bay and await transfer.\nDodging requests for transparency about targeted killings: Holder has staunchly defended the administration\u2019s claim that the U.S. has the legal right to kill American citizens overseas, as in the killing of"}

But then after a security screening line that made US airports look like a ballet, the groups all joined together, with some still unscreened.

Any senior citizens living on Social Security and, hopefully, some pension money also realize that a 20-cent-per-\u00adgallon gas tax increase would have a significant impact on their mobility. Not only would they see an increase in cost if they drive their own cars, but that cost would certainly be passed along in other forms of transportation such as cabs, Uber, buses, prescription deliveries, trash, recycling \u2014 any private or public gas-dependent service. We regularly read about the isolation many seniors feel because they have difficulty getting around. Adding an additional cost burden will not help. It amazes me that the Legislature continues to tax Social Security for seniors yet does not factor in their (in many cases) limited income and the ramifications that all the tax increases have on senior lives with little in the way of programs and protections for those same seniors. State Sen. Jim Abeler\u2019s consideration of a 10-cent increase at least seems a bit more reasonable. Or, how about not taxing Social Security?\nI hope our elected representatives and senators from the GOP noticed that the price of gas went up 20 cents last week. Supposedly this is due to refinery issues and price of crude. Are we getting better roads from this increase? No. Are we getting safer bridges? No. Are local gas stations earning higher profits? No. Are oil companies reaping bigger profits to help pay for their executives and increase shareholder profits? Yes. Did anyone drive less because of the price increase? Most likely not.\nYes, we can probably fund road projects with the general budget, but only at the expense of education and health. A gas tax is a user fee. For the most part, the bigger the vehicle, the more wear it does to the road and the more gas it probably needs. Higher gas prices tend to move people to more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternate transportation, both of which are better for the environment, roads, and transit costs. Are we going to notice the increase due to a tax? Probably only for a day or two. We are going to pay more for gas anyway; we might as well get something for it.\nWe are \u201cOne step closer to sanity on the roads\u201d (March 20) with a bill restricting the use of cellphones while driving.

Blueberry Hill, a prominent recording label, is conducting a national songwriting contest about darts. The idea is to cut a hit record and have it on the jukebox of every dart bar in the country.\nThat is just one indication of the kind of respect being given darts, a simple and inexpensive game nearly everyone has either played or seen played.\nAnother is that world-renowned Buck Knives Inc. of El Cajon has created a new division called Buck Darts. The company researched the market extensively before going with the dart line, and its findings indicate that more than 18 million Americans own and play darts. In 1988, 5 1/2 million dart sets were purchased.\nC.J. Buck, whose great-grandfather, Hoyt Buck, made knives around the turn of the century, said the company's dart products are selling very well and that projections show national darts sales doubling in the next six years.\nBut perhaps the greatest barometer of the popularity of darts in San Diego County is the number of boards being hung in local pubs and bars.\nFour years ago, Scolari's Office in North Park did not have any dart boards. Pool was the rage then, and Scolari's had pool tables.\nAccording to a regular named Turk Doerr, \"This little guy . . . brought in a cabinet that . . . had a (dart) board inside. Guess what happened? Pretty soon we had a line going all the way to the bathroom. Everybody wanted to play darts.\n\"I used to shoot in pool leagues for money. But they had to keep pulling me away from the dart boards when it was my turn to play pool. I started thinking, 'Something's going on here.' \"\nScolari's now has six boards, most of which are in use every night of the week. And your name does not have to be listed in Donald Trump's Rolodex for you to know that barkeepers who keep customers in their bar earn more money.\nIt is not just the traditional metal-tip darts. Many bars are installing plastic-tip dart board machines with electronic scoreboards. For 25 or 50 cents, the machine will tabulate your score in popular games such as 301, 501 and cricket.\nWhat does all this mean? Well, someday there may be a nationally televised Levi's 501 Open or a Walt Disney's Jiminy Cricket Classic offering big-time prize money.

Mr. Levy's appointment hinges on the state education commissioner's waiving a requirement that local schools chiefs in New York hold education administrator credentials.\nMr. Levy, who is 47, said in a statement that he grew to care about the state of New York City's schools when he chaired the Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform, a panel that studied the deterioration of city school buildings and came to be known as the Levy Commission.\n\"We pointed out the life-threatening conditions of our public schools and helped to change them,\" Mr. Levy said. \"I well recognize the depth of the challenge and have no political or social agenda.

{"idx": "16400", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: For military and intelligence communities, outer space has become a highground, hide-and-seek arena -- a kind of \"now you see me, now you don't\" espionage playing field.\nOver the decades, spying from space has always earned super-secret status. They are the black projects, fulfilling dark tasks and often bankrolled by blank check.\nHowever last month, several U.S. senators openly blew the whistle on a mystery spy satellite program, critical of its high cost while calling to question its utility in today's post-9/11 world.\nOne lawmaker, Jay D. Rockefeller (D-WV), the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, openly criticized the program on the floor of the U.S. Senate. He said the program \"is totally unjustified and very wasteful and dangerous to national security,\" adding that he has voted to terminate the program for two years, with no success.\nThere is now a delicate dance underway between issues of national security and open public scrutiny about taxpayer dollars being spent wisely or squandered. Meanwhile, the swirl of secrecy seems to be revolving around a top secret \"stealthy\" satellite project, codenamed MISTY.\nFirst, there's a little unclassified history.\nThe U.S. stealth satellite program at issue was first spotlighted publicly by Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow of the National Security Archive in Washington, D.C.\nThe Archive is gathering declassified U.S. documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. In doing so, the Archive declares they have become the world's largest non-governmental library of declassified documents.\nThe MISTY effort was broached in Richelson's first-rate book on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), The Wizards of Langley: Inside the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology, published in 2002 by Westview Press in Boulder, Colorado.\nRichelson described the launching of the stealth imaging satellite via space shuttle Atlantis in 1990. He noted that MISTY's objective was to lessen the threat to U.S. satellites from the Soviet Union -- a nation whose anti-satellite program was of \"significant concern\" to U.S. military space officials during the early 1980s, he wrote.\nBut within weeks after MISTY's shuttle deployment, both U.S. and Soviet sources reported that the satellite malfunctioned. Richelson explained that a spacecraft explosion \"may have been a tactic to deceive those monitoring the satellite or may have been the result of the jettisoning of operational debris.\"\nWhatever the case -- and to the chagrin of spysat operators -- a network of civilian space sleuths had been monitoring a set of MISTY maneuvers and the explosion, ostensibly part of a \"disappearing act\" meant to disguise its true whereabouts.\nRichelson has posted on the Internet declassified documents he has obtained that track the historical roots of the still active stealth satellite work, dating as far back as 1963.\nOne document is U.S. Patent 5,345,238, issued to Teledyne Industries of Los Angeles, California in 1994. It details a movable \"satellite signature suppression shield\" -- a bit of clever technology that can suppress the laser, radar, visible, and infrared signatures of a satellite.

Nine tractor crews from the Florida Division of Forestry and a helicopter from Flagler County also were involved.\nWinds spread the blaze so quickly that the animals at a county-run animal shelter couldn't be evacuated in time, said Jeremy Robshaw, spokesman for St. Johns County Fire and Rescue. Firefighters sprayed water around the perimeter of the facility.\n\"Basically, you see the fire burned up to the wood line on all sides of the structure,\" Robshaw said.\nAs of 9 p.m., the fire was 50 percent contained, and the only structural loss was a shed.\nThe owner of a Bradford County tanning bed business operated from a barn has been charged with video voyeurism after authorities found tapes, cassettes and other secret recordings of customers.\nDoyce Dean Griffis, 46, of Starke has run the business since 2000, according to the Bradford County Sheriff's Office. Tuesday, two women told investigators women using the bed were being recorded without their knowledge.\nDetectives seized four large containers of video tapes, 30 or more cassettes, 41 DVDs and two memory cards as evidence. A two-way mirror and other equipment was also recovered.\nDetectives are trying to determine identities of several people in the recordings. Anyone who has used the tanning bed can contact detective Kevin Mueller at (904) 966-6304 or email him at kevinmueller@bradfordsheriff.org.\nA woman has been sentenced to one year in jail and five years' probation for a wreck that killed a Jacksonville exchange student who was riding a motor scooter.\nAuthorities say Brittaney Nicole Briscoe, 21, was driving nearly 70 mph in a 45-mph stretch of Beach Boulevard near Pemberton Street in September 2009 when she rammed into 23-year-old Yasser Ibrahim Hamdy, an MBA student originally from Egypt.\nProsecutors say Briscoe drove away from the crash and evaded authorities for months before her May 2010 arrest. She pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a crash involving death March 16.\nHamdy was flung from the scooter and run over by another car.\nBriscoe faced up to 10 years in prison when Circuit Judge Brad Stetson sentenced her Wednesday.\nMartens was at a work site just north of Sadler Road when he was hit by the Jeep driven by James Buzzard, 59, of Fernandina Beach, said Highway Patrol Lt.

The last pay raise was in 1996, when it rose from $543.\nAlthough midshipmen receive a free education -- and free room and board -- at the academy, they must pay for their uniforms, personal computers, haircuts and laundry. Because they are part of the U.S. Navy, they receive a military salary.\n\"And it teaches them a little bit of fiscal responsibility,\" said academy spokesman Cmdr. Mike Brady.\nRaises are in store for students at the four other service academies -- the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.; the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo.; the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.; and the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y.\nThose pay increases -- plus a 3.6 percent raise for military and civilian professors at the five schools -- are compliments of the nearly $270 billion National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Clinton in October.\nAt the Naval Academy, most midshipmen have their pay deposited automatically into a Navy Federal Credit Union account -- $28.8 million annually, charged to the Navy's account.\nMidshipmen don't pocket $600 a month to spend as they wish. Before their paycheck hits the bank, the Navy deducts money to repay the loan midshipmen receive their freshman year to buy personal computers and the uniforms for their four years in Annapolis.\nFreshmen have $60 left each month. The amount increases each year as the loan dwindles: Sophomores get $115 each month; juniors get $160; and seniors get $250.\nSeniors get more because they are closer to paying off their loans and have more evenings and weekends off -- the privileges of their seniority. This year, there are fewer weekends of liberty in which to spend their salaries.\nIn September, Superintendent Vice Adm. John R. Ryan, in an effort to refocus on academics, cut the number of weekends midshipmen are allowed off campus. For freshmen, the liberty schedule didn't change: They get no weekends off. Sophomores get two instead of three weekends of liberty; juniors get four, down from five; and seniors get seven, down from eight."}

They need to re-organize how they're merchandising online and in store,\" said June Cotte, a marketing professor at the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ont.\n\"You can't just have a lip service blog and a very binary-focused retail model.\"\nAmil Reddy, who works for MEC's strategic partnerships and community investments department in Vancouver, BC, recently wrote a blog post featuring gift ideas for people who identify as neither male nor female.\n\"There's a social and moral imperative to be a part of creating social change, and reflect the people who we are trying to serve, but there's also a business imperative,\" Reddy told CBC News.\nReddy, who is transgender and uses the pronouns they/them, wrote the \"Gift ideas for them\" blog, which is being promoted on social media sites such as Facebook. MEC also has other lists including \"Gift ideas for him\", \"Gift ideas for her\" and \"Gift ideas for the friend who is always cold.\"\n\"Folks like myself have really great purchasing behaviour. You see 'Gifts for him' and 'Gifts for her' and it really leaves a lot of folks out of the conversation,\" said Reddy.\n\"As a trans person of colour, I really feel it is important that diverse lived experiences are reflected. Even though it's just a marketing list, it ends up being super reflective and celebratory, because you're being seen for the first time.\"\nThe items on Reddy's list include a cooler, cozy slippers and a backpack. The descriptions underneath are gender non-specific and tongue-in-cheek.\n\"For the couple in your life that's ready for the big commitment of a cooler built for two, right down to theirs-and-theirs handles on each side,\" the description on the cooler states.\nIt's a good first step to making transgender people fully accepted in the mainstream, according to Aaron Devor, the chair in transgender studies at the University of Victoria.\n\"We usually see advertising that are directed to people on the binary and MEC has put out this idea that they're being inclusive of people who are non-binary,\" Devor said.\n\"There's a tremendous number of people who might be men or women but are not interested in items that are specifically targeted to their gender.\"\nCompanies have become much more willing to use positive LGBTQ portrayals in their advertising, with brands such as Absolut Vodka, Ikea, and Microsoft embracing the market.\nBut it can't come off as fake, said Nick Hall, the founder and owner of Human, a London, Ont.-based marketing and branding firm.\n\"Brands are about a feeling.

The rolling spasms, bone pain and general discomfort her daughter had been experiencing of late, she says, had finally sent the two of them to find an in-network orthopedic surgeon for treatment.\nBut according to Suzanne, Tamara\u2019s pain wasn\u2019t enough to warrant medical attention. \u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t help you, come back when you have a problem.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t even look at her foot,\u201d Suzanne recalls now.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time a medical professional had turned down Suzanne and her daughter for medical care. Tamara, a 24-year-old wheelchair user with advanced cerebral palsy and multiple attendant disabilities, needs access to professionals who treat her with dignity and who have the skills to suit her needs. Because Suzanne, Tamara\u2019s sole caretaker, was covered through Aetna-managed Medicaid, those doctors must also be in her network. And finding them, the Klugs say, is a near-impossible task.\nMedicaid, once considered one of the crowning achievements of The Great Society, is now being dismantled by those entrusted with its care. Plagued by a poorly designed medical reimbursement process that rewards health care professionals for providing medically unnecessary care and yet doesn\u2019t pay enough for many specialists or small providers to deal with burdensome administration, the popular program has been a target of reform for decades.

Under this system, private insurance companies, or Managed Care Organizations (MCO), receive a fixed monthly payment from the state per Medicaid patient. In exchange, they agree to work with hospitals to strike deals and lower costs.\nThe first step in this process for an MCO is to sort patients by health risk by reviewing their medical records or, in severe cases, sending a social worker to evaluate them at home. As a hypothetical example, if 100 people enrolled in Aetna\u2019s MCO were at risk of a heart attack, Aetna would calculate how many of them could improve their health through low-cost interventions, such as free gym memberships and dietary counseling. If Aetna decided that, say, 60 of the new enrollees wouldn\u2019t need access to expensive cardiologists if they improved their eating and exercise habits, it could then approach regional hospitals and doctors with a bargain: a guaranteed referral of 40 new patients to said facilities in exchange for lowered medical costs"}

It used MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link), a newish connector found on a bunch of Android handsets, including Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S II and Galaxy Nexus, HTC\u2019s EVO 3D and Rezound, and others.\nMHL connectors are essentially HDMI ports that let your phone charge as it\u2019s outputting video. They\u2019ve been promoted mostly as an easy way to plug a phone into a big-screen TV to watch HD video, but Pioneer\u2019s use of MHL shows that they can be used for other applications, too.\nMHL won\u2019t let Android phones catch up with the iPhone when it comes to add-ons. For one thing, many Android phones don\u2019t have MHL yet. For another, those that do put the connector in different places, which makes for design challenges that Apple\u2019s always-on-the-bottom Dock Connector doesn\u2019t present. But if MHL catches on, Android users may finally get access to more of the nifty accessory devices that iPhone owners take for granted.\nWow, this is good news to all android phone users eh..\nACTUALLY Harry, the biggest barrier is disparate physical physical dimensions of the different phones. Samsung has phones that sell near iphone levels.\n@The_Heraclitus: No, of course you won\u2019t. It\u2019s something that reflects negatively on the Holy Apple, and anything that reflects badly on the Holy Apple won\u2019t see the time of day here on Tech-Apple-izer unless it can be spun in the Holy Apple\u2019s favor.\nWozniak just can't learn to control his tongue.

What the county commissioners desire to do is take away that watchdog.\"\nThe decision to create the county force came after years of discussion about abolishing the resident trooper program, which has been based at the state police barracks in Westminster.\nThe resident troopers have been the county's primary law enforcement for more than 30 years. But change has become necessary as Carroll County's population has swelled to about 170,000.\nEven before the public hearing began, state Sen. Larry E.

Powell, the county chief of staff. \"This has been a long debate. This has not been a quick issue.\"\nThere is agreement that the resident trooper program is not a long-term solution for growing Carroll County, he said.\nEliminating the trooper program would save $1 million annually, according to county officials. The sheriff's department would remain in place.\n\"There is no appreciable difference between the cost to run a future unified sheriff's department and the cost to operate a county police department,\" Powell said.\nSheriff Kenneth L. Tregoning said he has urged county commissioners for 21 years to create a law enforcement master plan, which has not been done. Suddenly there is a sense of urgency to get somewhere without any plan in place, he said.\nFor several years, he has pushed for his department to assume primary responsibility for law enforcement in the county.\n\"There is no sound reason that the county is going forward at this speedy and reckless pace to dismantle the sheriff's department,\" Tregoning said.\n\"Here they want to change the entire face of law enforcement, and they have not had one public meeting. I find that disgraceful,\" he said.\nTregoning urged a longer transition period that allows for phasing in the changes rather than compressing them into the remaining months before July.\nCarroll County Sheriff's Lt.

The proposal would have replaced plans for three two- or three-story office buildings at the site, which is located across Coffee from Town & Country Village Shopping Center.\nA pair of five-story student dormitory buildings has been proposed for 6.45 acres of vacant land at the northeast corner of Coffee Road and Stockdale Highway. The proposal would replace earlier plans for three two- or three-story office buildings at the site, which is located across Coffee from Town & Country Village Shopping Center.\nUnless the developer who proposed dorms at the site files an appeal \u2014 and there's still no sign he will \u2014 it may soon be time to revisit the decades-old question of what should be built on the last piece of vacant land at the busiest intersection in Bakersfield.\nThe northeast corner of Coffee Road and Stockdale Highway, across from Trader Joe's, poses a substantial opportunity for whatever type of development eventually goes in there. It's situated in a desirable neighborhood near Cal State Bakersfield along two main thoroughfares.\nThe roughly 6.5-acre property has been designated a professional and administrative office zone, meaning the city officially would prefer it become home to professional office-type uses, something like a bank, a doctor's office, a church, a pharmacy, a post office, a day-care nursery \u2014 maybe even a fortune-telling business.\nBut practically speaking, it doesn't have to be any of those things, so long as city officials give the nod. That's why Monterey-based Coleraine Capital Group Inc. was able to propose building twin, five-story student dorms at the property: President David Moon thought he could persuade the city to let him override the property's zoning and instead build residential buildings at the site.\nHis plan fell Tuesday in the face of overwhelming opposition by nearby residents, who took issue with the potential for traffic, safety and privacy disruptions, among other concerns. Moon may still challenge the city Board of Zoning Adjustment's 3-0 vote of denial. He said by email Wednesday he has not decided whether to appeal the decision to the City Council.\nUntil Moon came along, the property was thought to be the future home of offices, professional or medical. Bakersfield developer Greg Bynum said Wednesday that may still be its \"highest and best use.\"\nHe noted a developer can put in offices at the site without asking special permission. But he acknowledged that, in light of Coleraine's experience, it might be a good idea to win over neighbors first. And he figures offices would fit in well.\n\"I think office and medical-professional (offices) can be good neighbors because they work normal business hours and the traffic is normal,\" he said.\nOn the other hand, Bakersfield commercial real estate broker Anthony Olivieri is thinking a mix of uses might work better: office plus retail plus restaurant.

{"idx": "16428", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Healthcare stakeholders have diverse agendas that make transparency a complex issue.\nNo-one would argue that transparency, such as that cited by GSK's Phil Thomson, is a bad thing. Countless government regulators, patient advocates, journalists and industry leaders want to see sensible schemes to address the growing clamour to tell all.\nBeyond the obvious - more transparency is better - this is a complex issue that involves multiple stakeholders, diverse agendas, even life and death.\nFor example, the drug development and approval process is laborious and long. Phase III clinical results may not bear up when hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people take the drug. The larger usage pool can reveal new findings that were not apparent in the testing process. No-one lied or tried to cover up information. There was total transparency, but the facts changed.\nIt may take a company some time to work out why the discrepancy occurred and how best to communicate the new information.\nPharma companies are highly regulated and highly cautious. They abide by a complicated set of standards that govern what they can and cannot say. Information, prematurely released or containing inaccuracies, can find its way around the world in a matter of minutes, so companies must try to control what they say and to whom they say it if they want to preserve their reputations and the public's trust.\nThen there is the role of the media. Are they merely gatekeepers, or influencers whose opinions are framed by their relationship with the industry? I have worked with dozens of healthcare reporters over the years and none of them has ever said: 'Give me dramatic headlines that will sell news.' Just the opposite. Most journalists toil tirelessly, doing research and conducting interviews with independent third parties so they get it right.\nDoctors and other healthcare professionals are also maligned, accused of succumbing to external influences when they prescribe certain medications. To imply that a skilled medical professional shouldn't be paid fairly for his or her expertise is absurd.\nPatient advocacy organisations are important stakeholders whose voices must be considered when talking about transparency. Most are adept at distilling complex information and communicating the pros and cons to patients. In fact, there is often an outcry from patients who want to be included in clinical trials. People can be desperate. This is why many countries allow patients access to unlicensed drugs in compassionate-use programmes.\nFinally, public relations professionals are also often held up to the transparency magnifying glass. We are accused of dramatising data results to grab headlines. That, too, is patently absurd. We spend hours researching and talking to clinical investigators and independent doctors to understand a drug - its benefits, side effects and mode of action. We must cite everything we write. We must include fair balance information. And then our materials go through an excruciating, time-consuming legal and regulatory review. It would be almost impossible to communicate misleading or false information in these press materials.\nThe call for transparency has received a great deal of attention in recent years and many stakeholders have chosen to engage with the issue. However, any call for increased transparency has to take into account these many complicating factors and the dynamics of these multiple stakeholders. Ultimately, we all have one goal: to give patients better treatment options and better outcomes.\nThe Health and Social Care Bill offers real opportunities for pharma marketers.

But there are other details you really should consider before you make a purchase - things like potential auto repair costs while you own the car, if the manufacturer has recalls posted for any parts of the car and even what your new insurance costs will be. Here's a checklist to help you research the car you're interested in buying, just to make sure you're getting the best deal you can get.\n- Before going to the lot, determine which car model(s) you are interested in. Then research them online - and this works if you're purchasing new or used. Check safercar.gov for consumer complaints and government notices about recalls - especially if you're shopping used. See if there are any articles about the manufacturing company that could affect your purchasing decision.\n- Determine how expensive it will be for you to replace auto and body parts on the car as it ages. For example, will replacing the shocks or struts cost you around $200 or $1,400? Or will replacing the belts, brakes, headlights or radiator cost more than they would on a different model? For a great resource to compare the cost of replacement auto parts, look up the Repair Index at online auto parts retailer RockAuto.com.\n- If you're buying used, check out the car's history. You can opt to purchase a vehicle history report from a number of different companies, or visit the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System at nmvtis.gov for additional information and resources.\n- Check with your insurance agent about the potential higher expenses you may have to pay when you purchase your new car. A car model that is less safe or more expensive to repair will have higher insurance premiums, as will cars that are high on the theft list. Make sure those expenses don't go over your budgeted amount for insurance.\nVolkswagen reported a loss of $1.3 billion in net income in 2009 from the previous year.\nQ: I own a 2008 Ford Fusion.

Most recipes use onions, but Clark uses scallions, so I did too. She added lime zest for some reason, so I fished out my microplane and started grating. And yes, I took a bag of fresh snap peas* and shucked them. Like you do.\nHere's the \"normal\" version, made as God intended, with avocados, an onion substance (scallions), salt, lime, and cilantro. Usually I also add garlic or onion powder, but I skipped that this time because I know all about controlled trials.\n\"Alright, which should I try first, the American guac or the terrorist one?\" asked my boyfriend.\nWe both had a little of each on lightly salted tortilla chips. According to the recipe, the peas \"add intense sweetness and a chunky texture to the dip, making it more substantial on the chip.\"\nTo quote Justice Scalia, that is a bunch of jiggery-pokery. The pea guac wasn't disgusting, but only because we could hardly taste the peas. Also, guacamole doesn't need this much sweetness or starchiness. Its eaters should be hit primarily with the fatty smoothness of the avocado, punctuated only by some acid, salt, and (occasionally) spice. At best, the peas were sort of a dull filler, like breadcrumbs in meatloaf.\nMy boyfriend proclaimed it \"like a chicken McNugget versus a chicken wing. The only reason to add peas would be if you had a pea surplus at the same time as a guac surplus.\"\nPerhaps the pea-guac pitchfork mob got a little carried away. It's just that Clark messed with the wrong spread.** Guacamole has recently seen a remarkable cultural ascendance, in tandem with (and propelled by) the rise of Mexican food in general.\nAnd it serves an important social role: Guac is the perfect mascot for a nation of amateur gourmands who like to perform wholesomeness and casualness at the same time. It\u2019s the party food that frat bros don't have to be ashamed to spend an afternoon preparing. Making a tasty guac is the kind of skill neurotic people like me br"}

Instead, Rhodes\u2019s boss deliberately bypassed our constitutional structure and struck the agreement unilaterally, the operating theory being that if the president called it something other than a \u201ctreaty\u201d then it would become something other than a treaty. Which, of course, it . . . did. In my view, circumventing the Senate in this way was a gross violation of the American system of government and a disgraceful exercise in linguistic gamesmanship. But one doesn\u2019t have to agree with that to accept that, because Obama took this approach, he ended up with a non-treaty. And non-treaties lack the imprimatur and broad-based acceptance that treaties, by design, tend to enjoy. If the president wanted his arrangement to be more permanent, he should have gone to the Senate. And if he didn\u2019t go precisely because he knew the Senate would say no, then he knew all along he was building on sand. Whose fault is that, pray? His successor\u2019s?\nA related talking point holds that by \u201cunilaterally\u201d leaving the agreement, President Trump has acted as arrogantly as did President Obama. This, too, is nonsense. Our system would be ludicrous if it permitted President A to put in place deals on his own, but required President B to gain the acquiescence of Congress in order to withdraw from those deals. Obama set this deal up on a discretionary basis. It can, quite obviously, be nixed on the same terms. Indeed, there is far more justification for reversing unilateral actions unilaterally than there is for taking them in the first place. To equate a president unilaterally nuking a constitutionally questionable unilateral decision with a president taking a constitutionally questionable unilateral decision is akin to equating the man who returns a stolen car with the man who stole it in the first place. I am as staunch a critic of the imperial presidency as you\u2019ll find. I am, at root, a legislative supremacist. But we will not get very far in that aim if presidents giving up stolen power is itself held to be an arrogation."}

It appears that European banks secured dollar funding through issuance of commercial paper and other short-term instruments that US money market funds purchase.\nFitch estimates that 10 of the top 15 issuers of such short-term paper are European banks and Moody's estimates that of over half of that is accounted for by French banks. There has been a net withdrawal from US money market funds and it appears that the funds have moved to strictly US Treasury or US high grade money market funds. This, coupled with new regulations/fees, and a reduction of bill offerings from the Treasury as it approaches its debt-ceiling, has weighed on US bill yields. The 4-week bill yield appears negative and the 3-month bill is at about 1 bp annualized yield, for example.\nIn addition, a large Spanish bank is reportedly experiencing difficulty in recent weeks funding itself in the US CP market. The amounts involved seem relatively modest compared to the bank's balance sheet, but the tension is evident. Moody's warning on Italian banks also pushes in the same direction.\nThese money market developments are consistent with another dimension to another issue we have discussed recently--the pressure evident in the basis swap (cost of swapping euros for dollars by European banks). These developments emanate from concerns about counter-party risk. This is consistent with market talk that some institutions are reducing some credit lines/exposures to European banks. Banks appear to be responding by hedging/securing funding through yen swaps. Note that Japanese 3-month T-bill yield of 9 bp annualized is the lowest in nearly 5 years.\nIn addition, the European banks may be more aggressive in borrowing from the ECB in its weekly facility.

If the culprit in question were you or I, we would find ourselves in a lot of hot water, having to answer some pretty tough questions.\nUnfortunately, when the thief is a CEO, a different set of rules often applies.\nThe person who should be on the \u201chot seat\u201d is Richard Dugas, Chairman and President of Michigan-based PulteGroup Inc., the nation\u2019s largest homebuilder.\nIn 2010 Pulte Group received $900 million from the Worker Home Ownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009. Pulte had lobbied for the bill\u2019s passage. The act was intended by Congress and President Obama to be a job-creation measure. One year later, workers are still waiting for those jobs.\nWhile Dugas remains free to enjoy the life a salary and compensation of $6.6 million (his total for 2010) can bring, a coalition of labor, faith and social justice advocates are increasingly putting Pulte in the spotlight. And, their anger is growing.\nOn May 11, at Pulte\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in a Detroit airport hotel, seven people peacefully staged a non-violent civil disobedience by sitting in the roadway and blocking a bus bringing Pulte\u2019s executives to the meeting.\n\u201cWhere is the money, where are the jobs,\u201d the large crowd broke out chanting.\nJames White, director of organizing for the Sheet Metal Workers Union said that money was given by the President to create jobs, not a CEO bonus. \u201cIt\u2019s time somebody is held accountable and it\u2019s time somebody went to jail,\u201d he declared.\nNot only has PulteGroup not hired additional workers it has laid off 350 at their Tolleson, Arizona plant and paid $10 million dollars in employee severance and related costs.\nWilliams and White are calling for a congressional hearing to look into the missing money.\nPulte\u2019s list of wrongs is deep. A fact-finding delegation from Interfaith Workers for Justice has previously reported that Pulte employees work in unsafe conditions, are not paid for overtime, work 60 to 70 hours a week to make ends meet and lack health care and other benefits.\nDemonstrators also want them held accountable for pushing adjustable rate mortgages that contributed to the economic and foreclosure crisis.\nAs Williams said, labor has vowed to be everywhere Dugas appears. In December he was to be the keynote speaker at the Detroit Economic Club\u2019s luncheon. However when word got out that labor and community folks were going to be there to greet him, he \u201cran\u201d and the whole luncheon was cancelled.\nAt the recent rally it was clear to everyone there that the wrong people were being arrested. However for Pulte, it is also becoming clear that sooner or later they will have to account for the $900 million.\nPhoto: Police handcuff activists after they staged a non-violent civil disobedience action against PulteGroup in Romulus, Mich.

The next election could help cement accomplishments like his signature healthcare program, a nuclear deal with Iran and moves to stem climate change, or fell them in a single blow.\nThe president lacks the votes in Congress to safeguard those efforts, much less pass other bitterly disputed pieces of his legislative agenda. His middling public approval ratings draw little in the way of deference from critics, or even restive allies. But Obama still commands attention each time he opens his mouth \u2014 never more so than occasions like Tuesday night's rarefied set piece.\nAfforded the grandest stage in all of American politics, the fiercely competitive president seemed almost cocky as he effectively kicked off his 2016 campaign, plainly itching to enter the fray and address what has been a running commentary on his time in office.\n\"All the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. So is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker,\" Obama said, wagging a finger as rumbling arose from the Republican side of the chamber. \"Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even close.\"\nHe repeated the last line three times for emphasis.\nObama, of course, will never again have to place his name on an election ballot, or have his policies weighed in a public referendum. But that is not to say he is immune from the judgment of voters, or has no stake in their deliberations.\nThe calculation is straightforward, as David Axelrod, a longtime Obama advisor, explained it: \"The stronger he is going into the election, the stronger his [poll] numbers, the better the chances of Democrats retaining the White House.\"\nGiven perhaps his last, best chance, Obama sought to frame the stark choice he sees between Republicans and his fellow Democrats.\nHe nodded to the anxieties that have made this a most angry and tumultuous election season.\nThe workplace has changed, he said, due in part to technology and a less-forgiving world economy that has sundered the social contract between workers and their employers. People are feeling squeezed, Obama acknowledged, \"even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing.\"\nThe black-and-white verities of the Cold War have given way, he said, to a complex and confusing world in which free-floating terrorists cause greater anxiety than hostile states. But no one, he said, should doubt the country's resolve.\n\"When you come after Americans,\" Obama said, \"we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.\"\nIn the main, however, Obama's speech was determinedly upbeat and relentlessly optimistic. Even if the language failed to reach the heights of his most soaring rhetoric, it was meant to contrast with the grave tone and grim prognoses of the GOP field.\n\"Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?\" he said"}

Earlier in the day, the Comets had beaten the Eagles 11-4 to extend their winning streak to 10 straight.\nIn game one, Spencer Pnacek (3-1) went the distance to get the win, allowing only one earned run.\nAt the plate, Pnacek was 3-for-4 with two runs batted in, while Jason Beckner, Tayven Cottrell, Nick Lovejoy, and Conner Arnold each added two hits for the Comets.\nIn game two, Coleman scored three times in the first inning, four times in the third, and once in the fourth to take a seemingly comfortable 8-0 lead into the bottom of the fourth. But CCC responded with four runs in the bottom of the inning to cut it to 8-4, then added three in the fifth and eventually tied it at 9-9 with two more runs in the sixth. Following a scoreless seventh, the game was postponed due to darkness.\nAccording to Coleman coach Tom Pashak, the game will be finished on a date to be determined only if either the Comets or the Eagles are in contention for a league championship at the end of the season.\nPashak used three different pitchers in the nightcap, as starter Tyler Germain went 4 1/3 innings and gave up six runs on seven hits, Becker went 1 1/3 innings and allowed two earned runs on four hits, and Josh Hilliard threw 1 1/3 scoreless, hitless innings.\nHilliard was 3-for-3 at the plate, while Lovejoy and Carson Cotton each added two hits.\n\u201cAfter winning the first game, that was 10 in a row for us.

It doesn&apos;t hold water,\" Claude Picasso was quoted in Liberation as saying. \"This was part of his life.\"\nTo some, the emergence of the works by the 20th century&apos;s most renowned artist is akin to opening a time capsule, or a discovery on par with the recent publication of Mark Twain&apos;s 100-year-dormant autobiography.\n\"Claude Picasso was astounded.

{"idx": "16451", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On Dec. 21, President Trump signed the First Step Act, a modest criminal justice reform bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Groups and individuals on the right, like the Koch Brothers, and the left, including activist and author Van Jones, supported it out of a mixture of concern about the ballooning cost of incarceration and alarm that those in prison were simply being warehoused, with their humanity and potential for rehabilitation and contributions to society being ignored.\nJared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior counselor, pushed hard for the bill, motivated by the fact that his father served time in federal prison for corruption. Among the provisions in the bill are: reducing 4,000 prisoners\u2019 sentences for good behavior; allowing more inmates to serve time under house arrest or in halfway houses; requiring that prisoners be incarcerated in locations no more than 500 miles from family members; prohibit the stacking of mandatory sentences for specific gun and drug offenses; and providing judges with more discretion to sentence defendants to less than mandatory minimum prison sentences for some low-level crimes.\nThe new law applies only to federal prisoners, who make up about one-tenth of the two million people behind bars in the U.S. Between The Lines\u2019 Melinda Tuhus spoke with Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, who examines what the new law does \u2013 and doesn\u2019t do.\nMARC MAUER: We\u2019re most encouraged by the sentencing reform part of the package that was put in place by the Senate leadership. One of the longstanding problems has been with the crack cocaine sentencing reform of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, but was not made retroactive. So this bill will now apply to about 2,600 people serving crack cocaine sentences in the federal system who did not receive the previous benefits of that legislation. It will move up their release dates by two years or so. We know that more than 80 percent of the people serving crack sentences are African American; for powder cocaine they are much more likely to be white or Latino.\nOther elements of the sentencing reform include a provision whereby previously the so-called three strikes and you\u2019re out in the federal system meant that for a third drug offense you would get life without parole, which is rather shocking. Now it\u2019s still going to be a very stiff sentence \u2013 it\u2019s a mandatory minimum of 25 years, but clearly less than a life sentence also.\nIn addition to sentencing reform, there are provisions in the bill to expand programming in federal prisons and people who complete the program successfully can earn credits toward an earlier release to a halfway house as they get near the end of their sentence. Technically, you are able to be transferred to a halfway house 12 months before the expiration of your sentence \u2013 it has been the policy for quite some time. One of the many problems with it is there\u2019s a severe shortage of halfway house beds, so most people who are able to transfer to a halfway house only benefit from having four to six months in a halfway house. So it\u2019s a question of whether the BOP (Bureau of Prisons) can scale up the number of beds that are available in these halfway houses, and with the huge backlog they already have, that\u2019s going to be a significant issue over the next several years.\nBETWEEN THE LINES: One of the things in this new law is that pregnant women in federal prison can no longer be shackle, and that extends to a few months after giving birth.

{"idx": "16454", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In August, the political tensions between Russia and the West finally reached into the chemical sector. Russia's Federal Service for Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare declared a number of household cleaning products unsafe for use in Russian homes. The service has made claims against American, Turkish, German and Russian manufacturers.\nIn Russia, it is customarily understood that allegations by such watchdogs more often reflect political struggles than a drive for higher quality standards. Germany is heavily invested in the Russian chemical sector, but German firms have kept a meticulously clean name.\n\"We are currently speaking clearly and directly with the Russian government and requesting they review and cancel their decision in short order,\" said Rainer Seele, president of the Russian-German Chamber of Commerce, in a statement. \"It is highly improbable that enterprises that manufacture their products in hundreds of countries worldwide somehow do not observe toxicity safety requirements specifically in their Russian operations.\"\nThe issue died down as quickly and unaccountably as it flared up, but German businesses operating in the sector continue to face challenges. While the political situation has undoubtedly been a challenge, the devaluation of the ruble has been at least as significant a factor.\nA recent report from the Russian-German Chamber of Commerce showed that 80 percent of surveyed companies found the drop in the ruble exchange rate to be the most challenging issue for their businesses in Russia. Other major concerns include weak market activity and lagging confidence in market development. A significant share of the primary goods required for the chemical manufacturing process is purchased from abroad, which drives up the production and final product costs.\n\"More than a half of Russia's chemical sector is dependent on imports. Certainly, owing to the drop in the ruble, all imported products have become more expensive, and to shift these costs onto consumers is not possible for a majority of firms. The situation changes in different industries. The most difficult situation is in the automotive industry. Sales in the first half of the year fell by 42 percent in comparison with the previous year,\" said Muzaffer \u00dcnver, managing director for Covestro, a leading manufacturer of polymer materials. Since Sept. 1, it has been a part of pharmaceutical giant Bayer.\nThe situation is also difficult in the oil and gas chemical sectors, and here smaller firms are really feeling the pinch. \"Large engineering firms, including giants such as BASF or Linde Engineering, have multiyear contracts with Russian companies, which they need to maintain. At the same time, the largest companies have the ability to speak with the Chancellor, and to adapt to the political situation. The stress to the small and medium size German business sector has been more significant and immediate,\" says Fares Kilzie, head of the Creon Energy consulting firm. \"This relates not only to falling demand in Russia, but also with the inability to find financing. Due to sanctions, the European market for credit is restricted. Russian banks offer credit at rates that make investments uneconomical. Development is possible only if the company invests its own capital, and this is a very rare event.\"\nThe chemical sector is also affected by problems in other segments of the Russian economy. The car production and construction industries, which are core markets for polymer producers, are both facing significant downturns and demand has also fallen in the consumer market.\nSome manufacturers have begun to focus their manufacturing on exports. For example, in June, the Continental automotive manufacturing firm said that its Kaluga-based plant would begin supplying tires to Finland. In September, the company further announced that deliveries would be made \"to several European and Asian countries.\"\n\"In the current economic situation, the instability of the Russian tire market and ongoing developments in the exchange rate"}

{"idx": "16464", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans are more trusting now than they were a year ago in the judicial branch of the federal government, while they have less trust in the executive branch, and their trust in the legislative branch has not changed. As is typically the case, Americans place the greatest faith in the judicial branch and the least in the legislative.\nThe current results are based on Gallup's annual Governance poll, conducted Sept. 6-10. They point to a continued rebound in Americans' trust in the judicial branch since 2015, when the percentage of Americans with a \"great deal\" or \"fair amount\" of trust fell to a record-low 53%. Today's 68% is back to the historical average in Gallup readings since 1972, including annual measurements since 1997.\nMeanwhile, the 35% of Americans who trust the legislative branch remains improved from its low point of 28% in 2014, but the positive momentum has apparently stalled given no increase in the past year. Trust in the legislative branch remains well below the historical average of 51% since 1972.\nAmericans' trust in the executive branch, now overseen by President Donald Trump, fell back to 45% this year after improving to 51% in 2016, President Barack Obama's last year in office. The current level of trust in the executive branch is similar to what it was in 2014 (43%) and 2015 (45%).\nThe historical low point in trust in the executive branch was 40% in April 1974 amid the Watergate crisis, but there have been several other readings below 50% since then, including three times under President George W. Bush (2006-2008), four times under Obama (2010-2011 and 2014-2015), and this year. The average level of trust in the executive branch is 55%.\nTrust in the three branches collectively remains below average from a historical perspective. Americans were most trusting of the three branches prior to Watergate and in the late 1990s and early 2000s likely because of a strong economy and the rally effects of the 9/11 terror attacks.\nWith conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the Supreme Court in April, Republicans' trust in the judicial branch has surged over the past year, from 48% in September 2016 to 79% today. Democrats are now less trusting in the federal judiciary (62%) than they were a year ago (74%), while there has been no meaningful change among independents. The overall increase in trust in the judicial branch is largely driven by the shift in Republican attitudes, which more than offsets the smaller Democratic decline.\nThe partisan shifts in judicial trust this year are similar to what Gallup observed in 2009, the last year the party of the president changed. That year, the new president had also successfully nominated a new justice to the Supreme Court by the time Gallup conducted the September Governance poll, with Obama's choice of Sonia Sotomayor joining the court that year. Democratic trust increased from 59% in 2008 to 87% in 2009, while Republican trust declined from 86% to 68%.\nTypically, trust in the executive branch is strongly correlated with party support.

Facebook, to its credit, saw the phenomenon coming: in a 2013 earnings call, then Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman acknowledged that teens were logging off the social network in growing numbers. \u201cWe did see a decrease in daily users, specifically among younger teens,\u201d Ebersman said. And the problem hasn\u2019t gone away. According to a 2014 survey conducted by Piper Jaffray, Facebook use among teenagers ages 13 to 19 dropped from 72 percent to 45 percent. In 2015, teens left Facebook because they found it \u201cmeaningless\u201d. For a company that relies, in part, on converting young adoptees into lifetime users, a teen exodus could create a demographic time bomb.\nNot every analysis is nearly so apocalyptic. A 2016 ComScore report showed that actually, young people weren\u2019t leaving Facebook\u2014despite investor and media concerns that teens had left the platform, they were spending more time on it than most other social networks. But now, Facebook\u2019s teen problem may be back. A new report from eMarketer suggests that Facebook\u2019s 12- to 17-year-old user base in the U.S. will decrease by 3.4 percent this year\u2014the first time eMarketer has predicted a decline among any age group in Facebook usage. Its estimates for Facebook users who are 18 to 24 years old \u201cwill grow more slowly than previously forecast, too,\u201d according to the firm. Even worse, there\u2019s now a group of children the firm calls \u201cFacebook-nevers,\u201d who are becoming tweens and skipping Facebook entirely.\nFacebook, of course, has been doing whatever it takes to keep its users\u2019 attention, investing in original video content and using an app called Onavo Protect to observe its users\u2019 behavior on their phones, helping Facebook see where they spend their time outside of Facebook\u2019s stable of apps, sending anonymized data in real-time to Facebook, including information about what apps users have on their phones, and how often they open them.\nC.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg has responded by using that data to crush his competitors, acquiring, imitating, or otherwise neutralizing any rival start-up\u2014like group video-chatting app Houseparty, which Facebook recently copied. Earlier this year, Facebook conducted focus groups with teens\u2014Houseparty\u2019s main demographic\u2014and offered them $275 Amazon gift cards for their time. This summer, The Verge reported that Facebook was building out its own group video-messaging tool called Bonfire.

Cotati residents will vote on November 7th on Measure G, a proposed cannabis business tax.\nA mellow off-year election could get an intriguing boost Tuesday when voters in two Bay Area cities consider marijuana taxation measures \u2014 but for those uninspired by ganja, local ballots also will feature rent control, an urban growth boundary and a school parcel tax.\nVoters in the cities of Pacifica and Cotati will decide whether to levy taxes on the gross receipts at cannabis dispensaries. The measures, both called Measure G, would raise an estimated $360,000 in Pacifica and $300,000 in Cotati, but the new taxes would also likely jack up the price of cannabis for consumers.\nThe two cities are among a very few Bay Area communities going to the polls Tuesday, including several cities in Sonoma County where recent fires and a decision to accept only mail-in ballots are expected to result in an exceedingly low turnout.\nThe town of Windsor is voting on a resolution to extend its urban growth boundary to the year 2040 and add a few extra parcels for commercial development. The Wilmar Union School District, just west of Petaluma, is seeking an annual $65 parcel tax that would last eight years, supporting the 240 students at Wilson Elementary School.\nTwo candidates are running for one seat on the Timber Cove Water District, in the tiny coastal hamlet of Sea Ranch.\nThe cannabis tax in Cotati has generated the most interest, though. The 7,500 residents of the suburb just south of Rohnert Park will decide whether to place a tax of up to 8percent on the gross receipts of pot cultivators, or up to $25 per square foot of cultivation. The measure would also tax manufacturing, distribution and retail sales. That would mean Mercy Wellness of Cotati would have to implement an initial tax of 2percent on sales, which would increase to 3percent in three years.\nThe owners at Mercy, the only cannabis dispensary in Cotati, said they would have to raise prices as a result of the tax, but the issue isn\u2019t foremost on the minds of Sonoma County residents as they recover from the disastrous fires that raged through their communities last month.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that all polling stations in Sonoma County will be closed Tuesday because of an executive order Gov. Jerry Brown issued after the fires. As of Friday, only 20percent of total ballots had been mailed in.\nPigs as pets? Benicia says yes.\nThe stakes may be higher in Pacifica, where the Cannabis Wellness Center on Palmetto Avenue has been operating without a license because none have been issued.

The smears have even spread to the author\u2019s listing on amazon.com where reviews of America Libre have been vandalized for political motives.\nThe controversy over America Libre has also generated public attention.

The story was based on information from an anonymous source.\nBy late the next day, its reporting under fire, CNN took some extraordinary steps: It retracted the story and apologized to Scaramucci.

It fired two producers responsible for that story. CNN spent almost a month investigating the Tailwind story before releasing a 54-page account of its actions.\nThe network\u2019s response to the Scaramucci story, however, was quick, decisive and largely private. CNN\u2019s managers investigated, retracted the report and accepted the journalists\u2019 resignations over a span of roughly 72 hours.\nThe network\u2019s general silence left a number of unanswered questions. CNN has never said why the story did not meet its \u201ceditorial standards,\u201d who at CNN reviewed it or how extensively the article had been vetted before publication. It also has not explained what prompted it to seek the resignations of the three journalists, an unusual action given that CNN has never declared the published story fraudulent or even false.\nCNN does not appear to have acted as the result of a legal threat, although Scaramucci, in a conversation with CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist, did object to the report after it was published.\nRather, people at the network say management acted so swiftly because the handling of the story violated a number of internal procedures. It was published, they say, before the completion of a review by the organization\u2019s \u201ctriad\u201d \u2014 a three-tiered bureaucracy of fact-checkers, legal advisers and standards executives who vet sensitive stories. Its reliance on a single source appears to have also been problematic, especially since the source \u2014 when contacted by a CNN reporter after the story was published \u2014 gave a different account of what had been reported.\nIn any event, CNN\u2019s management moved so quickly against the three journalists that the details of their severance agreements weren\u2019t fully set when their departure was announced, according to several people familiar with the matter.

He had tried everything, everywhere when he heard that there was a tender out in a small town in Mpumalanga.\nHe lived in Johannesburg, so he travelled extensively between the town and the city until he knew every tree on the side of the road.\nHe dined with the good and the great, laughed with the small and the insignificant, and shook the hands of the doorkeepers.\nFinally the tender went out.\nHe showed his boundless passion, his love for the small town and respect for its people who were as unmissable as the timber mines of the province.

Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.\nBoulder seeks three times actual damages and has estimated its costs at $100 million. Since essentially anyone could bring a lawsuit (and will if lawsuits start succeeding), the damages will far exceed any company\u2019s ability to pay.

Peter Beinart on our country\u2019s long track record of conflating religion and race.\nBut the bombers were white Americans. The Tsarnaev brothers had lived in the United States for more than a decade. Dzhokhar was a U.S. citizen. Tamerlan was a legal permanent resident in the process of applying for citizenship. And as countless commentators have noted, the Tsarnaevs hail from the Caucasus, and are therefore, literally, \u201cCaucasian.\u201d You can\u2019t get whiter than that.\nSo why did conservatives mock Sirota for being wrong? Because in public conversation in America today, \u201cIslam\u201d is a racial term. Being Muslim doesn\u2019t just mean not being Christian or Jewish. It means not being white.\nToday, Americans still often link Islam and dark skin. What\u2019s changed is which category we consider more dangerous. For much of American history, the problem with being Muslim was that you weren\u2019t considered white. Since 9/11, by contrast, one of the problems with not being considered white is that you might be mistaken for Muslim. Thus, four days after the Twin Towers fell, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh gas-station attendant, was gunned down in Mesa, Arizona, by an assailant who had boasted of wanting to kill \u201cragheads.\u201d Last December, a Hindu American named Sunando Sen was pushed into an oncoming subway train by a woman who explained, \u201cI hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001.\u201d Sodhi and Sen, needless to say, weren\u2019t Muslim. They just looked Muslim because they had dark skin.\nEven the anti-Muslim epithets that have flourished since 9/11\u2014for instance, \u201csand n----r\u201d\u2014have a racial connotation. And there\u2019s evidence that Barack Obama\u2019s dark skin is one (though not the only) reason so many Americans still think he\u2019s a Muslim. In 2010, Michigan State University psychologist Spee Kosloff asked supporters of John McCain whether Obama was a Muslim. Then he asked them the same question after they filled out a card in which they listed their race. Once racially triggered, the percentage who called Obama a Muslim jumped 21 points.\nAt base, the reason it\u2019s so hard for people to accept that the Tsarnaevs are white is because, since America\u2019s founding, being white has meant, both culturally and legally, being \u201cone of us.\u201d And since 9/11, in particular, being Muslim has meant the opposite. As a light-skinned Muslim, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev straddles that divide. But he straddles it in other ways, too. He was a pothead, a devotee of hip-hop, a lifeguard, a high-school wrestler, an aspiring dentist. And yet he became, it appears, a murderer on behalf of a fanatical species of Islam. He\u2019s a type that has reappeared again and again in our history, from every faith and in every shade: an American at war with America, both intimately familiar and frighteningly alien at the same time."}

She has served 16 terms in Congress as a representative from California since 1993 and is about to serve her 17th term in 2019.\nPelosi was the first woman to be the leader of either chamber of congress. Her ascent to Speaker of the House made her the highest-ranking female politician in U.S. history. During and after her tenure as speaker, her power and high position became contentious.\nAmong opposition Democrats, the main point of contention against Pelosi is simple: she\u2019s making it harder for them to win elections. With a left-leaning agenda, Republicans have used her high-profile position as the leader of House Democrats to associate her with Democrats running in moderate congressional districts, making it harder for them to win.\nBefore the 2018 midterm, Congressional Democrats have lost a lot of seats in recent years. They suffered huge losses in 2010 and 2014 and gained very few seats in 2012 and 2016. In 2017, they lost all four special elections.\nAs the leader of House Democrats, this is a bad look for Pelosi since she is supposed to strategize and lead her party to winning as many seats as possible. After the Republicans took over the House and her tenure as speaker ended in 2011, there have been talks of replacing her, but she has remained persistent on keeping her position.\nWhat\u2019s this about Democratic opposition?\nAfter the midterm elections, the talks of ousting Pelosi hit the ground running. A group of dissidents, including some newcomers who campaigned on promising to change Congress, wanted new leadership at the top of the party. However, some feared going public and facing retaliation. Although Pelosi has made no signs of this if she became speaker, there\u2019s a rich history of this occurring in the U.S.\nOn Nov. 19, 16 House Democrats wrote a letter opposing Pelosi. Even though they opposed her re-election, there were still no challengers running against her, highlighting fears of retaliation for going against the powerful representative.\nThe vote for Speaker of the House will help set the tone for the Democratic Party going into the 2020 presidential election. Whether Pelosi wins or not, the next speaker will set the agenda for the House, the only branch of government Democrats control. The speaker will also guide and strategize Democrats in elections both up and down the ballot for 2020.\nOn Wednesday, in a secret-ballot vote, Pelosi won the support from 203 Democrats with 32 no votes and three blank ballots. To become speaker, Pelosi will need at least 218 votes, a simple majority, in a House floor vote set for January 3.

With Mad Hatter, Sissons said this could reduce costs to approximately US$50 per user per month.\nMost of the savings, he said, come from reduced costs of software licensing.\nWhile the concept of Mad Hatter is similar to Lindows, an open source desktop manager based on Linux, Sissons said Sun is not threatened because it is targeting large enterprises with Mad Hatter.\nThe full details of Project Mad Hatter will be released Sun\u2019s user conference, SunNetwork in San Francisco, Sept. 16 to 18.

The deal, one of Walmart\u2019s various global investments and tie-ups geared at helping the retailer compete with Amazon.com Inc, is slated to close by year\u2019s end.\nIn the United States, Walmart is the largest seller of groceries but grapples with the challenge of swiftly delivering fresh food to the homes of online customers. The company has promised to make such deliveries in 100 U.S. cities by the end of 2018 and so far covers nearly 50 markets.\nIn a race to meet its goal, the company is working with several small delivery companies including Doordash and Postmates after ditching partnerships with ride-share companies Uber and Lyft.\nCornershop Chief Technology Officer Daniel Undurraga said in an interview on Tuesday that Cornershop plans to launch in Toronto in the first quarter next year. If it does well, Vancouver and Montreal would follow.\nIf Canada is successful overall, Undurraga said, the United States could be the next target.\n\u201cCanada is a good test market for launching a service in the U.S. It is very similar, but smaller,\u201d he said.\nWalmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Judith McKenna, chief executive of Walmart International, said in September that Cornershop was expected to provide a learning experience for Walmart\u2019s markets beyond Mexico and Chile.\nAn English-language version of the app will roll out within a month as part of preparation for the Canada launch, Undurraga said.\nCornershop still needs to partner with a local payments company and recruit workers in Canada. About 11,000 people currently work for Cornershop across 11 cities in Mexico and Chile.\nApart from Walmart the platform also offers deliveries from various retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Mexican chains Chedraui and La Comer. Undurraga said Cornershop is building firewalls so that Walmart cannot access customer data from other stores.\nThe company will also consider raising delivery fees to account for higher labor costs in Canada and the United States. Cornershop generates other revenue through advertising, commissions from retailers and price mark-ups.\nThe technology, however, is already in place.\n\u201cWe have our own tools for being able to do this without a lot of effort,\u201d Undurraga said."}

Dillashaw.\nAmong Johnson&apos;s complaints was a lack of promotion from the UFC to build him into a star as he approaches a landmark moment in his next fight where he could potentially break the record for the most title defenses in history.\nUFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier weighed in during the latest episode of \"UFC Tonight\" where he admitted that it might be harder to market a smaller fighter like Johnson but also defends the champion as doing his part to push the agenda throughout his career.\n\"I feel like he does take the fights that they tell him to fight. I feel like he&apos;s the guy that&apos;s there whenever they call on him. DJ&apos;s by far the most active champion in the UFC. Now you have to have &apos;it&apos;,\" Cormier explained. \"There&apos;s more to just being good and getting pay-per-view [points] and everything else. I think the responsibility for everything can be shared between Demetrious and the UFC. The UFC doesn&apos;t really understand how to market him because they have to get creative. He&apos;s smaller, he&apos;s not the biggest guy, he&apos;s dominant.\n\"Even when Anderson Silva was the guy that was running through the division, his points weren&apos;t very high. So they have to get creative. I don&apos;t know that they&apos;ve gotten creative but I do believe DJ has done his part so he does have valid points.\"\nJohnson also complained about the UFC attempting to force him into a fight with Dillashaw, who would be moving down from 135-pounds to challenge him in his history making performance.\nJohnson expressed worry that Dillashaw wouldnt make weight while also raising concerns that the former champion hadn&apos;t done enough to earn a shot at him without having a single fight in the flyweight division.\nCormier believes Johnson should run towards a fight with Dillashaw because not only does it give him the biggest opportunity for a higher payday on pay-per-view but it also gives him a legitimate challenge and that&apos;s something he&apos;s sorely lacked lately.\nThrough all the issues that Johnson raised during his statement, Cormier believes it all boils down to dollars and cents as the flyweight king is looking to raise his profile while being paid championship money.\nJohnson has long advocated for the champions in the UFC to be paid at a higher scale because they are the best fighters in the world regardless of how much they might sell in television ratings or on pay-per-view.\nCormier knows that star power plays a part in paychecks as much as wearing a gold belt around your waist, but he&apos;d like to see the UFC put up the cash to make Johnson happy so they can finally make the super fight with Dillashaw a reality rather than a rumor.\nAs of now, Dillashaw says he&apos;s still in training and cutting weight for the bout with Johnson although the UFC has still come to no agreement with the flyweight champion to make the fight official."}

{"idx": "16532", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: We have all become familiar of late with the term dubium (plural dubia). It literally means doubt, but it is really a question seeking clarification on a point of doctrine or practice, and usually addressed to the competent ecclesiastical authority in Rome.\nI have a dubium, which I may well send to the correct dicastery in Rome, in hope of an answer. It is this.\nIf a couple, who are living in a second union \u2013 that is to say, one of the parties has been sacramentally married before, divorced, and then married again civilly, with no canonical annulment of the \u2018first\u2019 marriage \u2013 if this couple, having approached a priest for the necessary accompaniment (as laid down in Amoris Laetitia chapter 8, and as interpreted, for example by the Maltese Bishops\u2019 conference), and having decided that they may in conscience approach the sacrament of Holy Communion, if this couple then ask to have their civil marriage convalidated by their parish priest, what is the parish priest to do?\nAs with so many dubia, I think we know the answer. The priest cannot possibly convalidate the marriage, because the \u2018first\u2019 marriage is still in existence, indeed that \u2018first\u2019 marriage is the only marriage. However, this reply will surely only confuse and sadden the couple, who have been told that they may receive Holy Communion and are thus not in a subjective state of sin. They may also feel that their civil union is what they would term a real marriage.\nBut the question is surely worth asking as it is surely only a matter of time before such requests are made.\nBack in 1930, the Lambeth Conference made several resolutions, one of which, Resolution 11, allowed the innocent parties of divorce who had remarried to approach Holy Communion, while at the same time upholding the principle of the indissolubility of marriage. The same resolution also forbids the remarriage of divorced people in Church. Indeed, reading those resolutions from so long ago, most of them strike me as admirable, and they serve as a sad reminder of the way things have changed since then, not only in the Anglican Communion, but in the Catholic Church too, and also in the wider world.\nThe pressure to marry divorced persons (with their spouse still living) in Church (which any Catholic will hold to be impossible), rejected at Lambeth in 1930, did not go away. Various compromises were made along the way, but today a couple who wish to marry in and Anglican church \u201csecond time around\u201d will usually not find it hard to do so. When doctrine crumbles, practice usually catches up in a few decades. Lambeth 1930 is a deeply conservative document, but it contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction.\nSo where does this leave my dubium? To be perfectly honest my dubium serves to highlight the inconsistency in Amoris Laetitia (as interpreted by the Maltese bishops). I would add another dubium to the first one. If a couple in a second non-canonical union, who in conscience decide they can receive Holy Communion, then decide to part, does their civil union, which ends in divorce, then have any continuing validity? If one decides that the \u2018second\u2019 marriage is the \u2018real\u2019 marriage, and that breaks up, does its \u2018real\u2019 nature survive divorce? This might be an important question, if it also happens that the spouse of the first marriage should then die, leaving the person free to marry canonically.\nI don\u2019t like casuistry at all, but"}

He even served as a touring member of the Beach Boys, filling in for Brian Wilson in 1964-65, and the next year played guitar on the band\u2019s landmark Pet Sounds.\nBut Campbell\u2019s greatest fame, of course, came later that decade and on into the next, when he scored hits on both the country and pop charts while simultaneously garnering notice as an actor (most notably co-starring with John Wayne in 1969\u2019s True Grit) and as the host of the popular Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, which ran on CBS from 1969 to 1972. Even when the crossover hits ended in the late \u201970s, Campbell continued to score a number of singles on the country charts.\nSunday night, in a return engagement at the Grove of Anaheim, the 74-year-old icon brought this wealth of music and memories to an enthusiastic crowd, interlacing his best-known songs with heartfelt stories and playful jousting with members of his band.\nAlthough Campbell only performed for roughly 70 minutes, his fast-paced show made up for such brevity with plenty of big-time audience favorites. Opening with \u201cGentle on my Mind,\u201d he followed with \u201cGalveston,\u201d both selections bolstered by plenty of impressive and mostly flawless fretwork from the master. Before the night was through, he had offered up equally effective takes on the uptempo \u201cTry a Little Kindness\u201d and \u201cSouthern Nights\u201d (complete with a 12-string guitar solo) as well as the achingly beautiful \u201cBy the Time I Get to Phoenix\u201d and \u201cWhere\u2019s the Playground, Susie?\u201d He also shared the thrill of working with the Duke as an introduction before singing the Oscar-nominated theme song from True Grit.\nBut the highlight of Campbell\u2019s set in Anaheim, as it is most anywhere he performs, was \u201cWichita Lineman,\u201d the Jimmy Webb classic, featuring some of his most emotive singing of the night and still more impressive guitar skills. Other standout moments came when Campbell\u2019s voice effortlessly blended with the sopranos of one or both of his daughters, Debby and Ashley (who also plays banjo, guitar and keyboards). Campbell\u2019s band is rounded out by one more of his eight children, Cal Campbell on drums and vocals, along with rhythm guitarist Ryan Jarred, bassist Siggy Sjursen and Campbell\u2019s musical director, keyboardist T.J.

Sitting on a couch at home between his coastal view and the memento from his former bar in the kitchen, Kelly Boyd took a swig of beer and let out a raspy laugh.\nAfter a cumulative 16 years (including the past 12) on the City Council, 25 years as owner-manager of the Marine Room and a lifetime as a Laguna Beach resident, Boyd knows almost everyone in the city.\nSince leaving the council in December, Boyd, 75, is fulfilling what he intended with his retirement. He splits his time between Laguna Beach and Palm Springs, where he and his wife, Michelle, own a second home. He watches antique car shows and fawns over his 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air. He plays and watches golf.

Growing up in Laguna, he collected friends and followers from all corners of town \u2014 whether surfing at Thalia Street Beach as a teenager or pulling up a bar stool at the Marine Room Tavern, which he owned with his brother, Bo, before selling it in 2012.\nBoyd managed to charm even those who disagreed with him, said longtime resident and former Councilwoman Ann Christoph. Though Boyd and Christoph sometimes battled over policies about trees and historic preservation, she appreciated that he welcomed her input.\nBoyd worked to establish the Alternative Sleeping Location as the city\u2019s first municipal shelter for homeless people. He helped reshape a view preservation and restoration ordinance while battling cancer.

Dots work with zero effort for most apps -- we even extract the color of the dot from your icon.\nAutofill framework simplifies how users set up a new device and synchronize their passwords. Apps using form data can optimize their apps for Autofill, and password manager apps can use the new APIs to make their services available to users in their favorite apps. Autofill will roll out fully over the next few weeks as part of an update to Google Play Services.\nSystem optimizations: We worked across the system to help apps run faster and smoother -- for example, in the runtime we added a new concurrent compacting garbage collection, code locality, and more.\nBackground limits: We added new limits on background location and wi-fi scans and changes in the way apps run in the background. These boundaries prevent unintentional overuse of battery and memory and apply to all apps -- make sure you understand and account for these in your apps.\nComplementary Android Vitals dashboards and IDE profilers: In the Play Console you can now see aggregate data about your app to help you pinpoint common issues - excessive crash rate, ANR rate, frozen frames, slow rendering, excessive wakeups, and more. You'll also find new performance profilers in Android Studio 3.0, and new instrumentation in the platform.\nAutosizing textview: Use autosizing TextView to automatically fill a TextView with text, regardless of the amount. You can create an array of preset text sizes, or set min and max sizes with a step granularity, and the text will grow and shrink to fill the available TextView space.\nFonts in XML: Fonts are now a fully supported resource type. You can now use fonts in XML layouts and define font families in XML.\nDownloadable fonts and emoji: With downloadable fonts you can load fonts from a shared provider instead of including them in your APK. The provider and support library manage the download of fonts and shares them across apps. The same implementation also supports downloadable emoji, so you can get updated emoji without being limited to the emoji built into the device.\nAdaptive icons: You can now create adaptive icons that the system displays in different shapes, based on a mask selected by a device manufacturer.

Coherent&apos;s system is more accurate than consumer-grade global positioning systems, which are generally accurate up to three to five meters. It can also acquire a user&apos;s position within a few seconds, compared to up to 40 seconds for a traditional GPS.\nCoherent was founded in 2008, and previously worked with Boeing, satellite network operator Iridium, and the U.S. Department of Defense. It also worked on various robotics and autonomous navigation projects.\nThis isn&apos;t Apple&apos;s first investment in the location-tracking space. Since 2009, Apple purchased a series of small mapping firms, including Placebase, Locationary, and Hopstop. In 2012, it launched Apple Maps, which combined some of that in-house tech with licensed technologies from TomTom. There&apos;s also been lots of buzz aboutApple possibly buying Nokia&apos;s HERE Maps division.\nAll these moves suggest that Apple is serious about growing Apple Maps&apos; presence against Google Maps.\nThe evolution of Apple MapsApple mainly relies on hardware sales to drive its top line growth, yet location-tracking abilities generally help mobile software and advertising based companies like Google.\nLast quarter, less than 9% of Apple&apos;s revenue came from software services like iTunes. Apple&apos;s fledgling mobile ad platform, iAd, only accounted for 0.3% of its top line last year, according to eMarketer&apos;s estimates. Therefore, improving the accuracy of Apple Maps won&apos;t directly boost the company&apos;s top line growth.\n25% of U.S. smartphone users (iOS and Android) currently use Apple Maps, compared to 47% who use Google Maps, according to Comscoreestimates. By comparing those figures with Apple&apos;s U.S. market share of 43%, we can estimate that roughly 58% of U.S. iPhone users use Apple Maps.\nWhy 58% isn&apos;t good enough58% sounds like a solid percentage, but it&apos;s not enough to prevent Google&apos;s ecosystem from creeping into iOS with ecosystem apps like Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Google Now, and Google Drive.\nSince Apple doesn&apos;t want iOS devices to generate search and ad revenues for Google, it started replacing Google services with its own. That&apos;s why it dropped Google Maps for Apple Maps, and replaced Google withMicrosoft Bing in default Siri and Spotlight searches. Bing will also likely replace Google as Safari&apos;s default search engine later this year.\nTherefore, if Apple boosts Apple Maps&apos; adoption rate in iOS to 100%, it will hurt Google&apos;s ability to gather location-based search data from iOS users. This means that apps like Google Now, which depend heavily on location and routine tracking, will be much less effective on iOS devices.\nGoogle Now also represents a threat to Apple Watch. If Google makes Android Wear devices compatible with iOS, Google Now will deliver location-based cards to users&apos; wrists, effectively tethering them to the Android ecosystem.\nLong-term benefitsCurbing Google&apos;s growth on iOS devices is definitely Apple&apos;s priority, but we shouldn&apos;t overlook the"}

That compares with 1% in 1999, when Gallup began asking the question on an annual basis.\nThese results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey, conducted Nov. 15-18. As part of that survey, Gallup asks Americans, in an open-ended format, to name the nation's most urgent health problem. The question was first asked in 1987, with obesity receiving mentions of 3% or less prior to the annual updates that started in 1999.\nAmericans' increasing concerns about obesity mirror the rising rates of obesity in the United States. The percentage of adults who are obese doubled from 1980 to 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Gallup and Healthways find obesity remains high as of the third quarter of 2012, at 26.1%.\nDespite the growing concern in the U.S. about obesity, it still ranks third on the list of most urgent health problems. Americans' top health concern remains access to healthcare, as it has been since 2007, but the 23% who name the issue this year is down slightly from 27% in 2011. The cost of healthcare is a close second, with the 19% naming it as the most urgent health issue -- on par with the past three years.\nCancer is the fourth most-named health problem in the U.S., with 13% saying it is the nation's most urgent health issue. No other health problem receives more than 2% of mentions.\nAIDS was the top concern each of the six times Gallup asked the question from 1987 through 1999.\nFour in 10 Americans name either healthcare access or cost as the most urgent health problem facing the nation, and another 2% mention \"government interference.\" While down from 55% in 2008, the combined 44% mentioning systemic issues with the healthcare delivery system today surpasses the 35% who mention a problem that is specific to a health condition-- more than two years after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. The law, though, will not go into full effect until 2014, which may explain the persisting concerns. Whether these lessen will likely hinge on the effectiveness of the new law in increasing access and bringing down costs in the coming years.\nAn increasingly urgent issue for Americans is obesity, with more people than ever worried about this problem. Obesity is a costly and potentially deadly health problem for the United States and one that has been worsening dramatically over the past three decades. Unless the problem is curbed -- either through public policies, greater focus by the medical world, or something else -- it is likely this issue will continue to make its way to the top of Americans' list of the most urgent health problems in the country.\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 15-18, 2012, with a random sample of 1,015 adults, aged 18 and older, living in the continental U.S., selected using random-digit-dial sampling.\nGallup surveyed 515 men and 500 women.

Trump\u2019s plans undermined the previously stated policy of senior U.S. officials.\nNow it appears that Trump\u2019s reversal is not quite so dramatic. On Monday, National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem that the withdrawal would be based on conditions \u2014 such as the protection of Kurdish allies and the defeat of the Islamic State. The process could take months or more than a year.\nGen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will begin negotiations with Erdogan and his government on protections for those Kurdish fighters. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me last week, the U.S. intends to have a relationship with those Kurdish fighters after any withdrawal. And the Turks themselves have requested U.S. assistance in supplying and transporting their forces in Syria, as well as air strikes.\nAll of these developments count as good news. A hasty, unplanned withdrawal from Syria would have left a vacuum, emboldened Iran and shaken America\u2019s Middle Eastern allies. There is a chance that this week\u2019s diplomacy from Bolton, Pompeo and Dunford will mitigate that.\nThat said, there is also a catch. The new Syria policy will be binding the U.S. much closer to an unreliable ally \u2014 namely, Turkey. It\u2019s important to remember that Erdogan\u2019s government still detains Serkan Golge, an American physicist, along with two Turkish nationals who worked for U.S. consulates there.\nLast year it appeared certain that Russia would be delivering its own S-400 air defense system to Turkey. Now it appears less so, in part because the Pentagon announced last month the sale of patriot missiles to Turkey. U.S. officials tell me this is part of a plan to get Erdogan to cancel the Russian sale. Nonetheless, Turkey\u2019s willingness to pursue an arms deal with NATO\u2019s primary adversary says a lot about how Erdogan views the alliance.\nThere is also an open question about whether the Turks are in any kind of position to help rebuild the villages destroyed by Islamic State. It was always uncertain whether Kurdish forces would be trusted by the local population after the defeat of Islamic State. Is there any reason to think Syrian Arabs would trust the Turks to be neutral arbiters?\nFinally, there is the question of Erdogan\u2019s treatment of Turkey\u2019s own Kurdish minority. It\u2019s vital the U.S. use its diplomatic leverage with Turkey to protect Syrian Kurdish populations. But the U.S. should not give Erdogan a green light to continue his purge of Turkey\u2019s Kurds, a cynical campaign that reverses some of the openings he made in the beginning of his presidency.\nA counterpoint to all of these objections comes from Bolton\u2019s former chief of staff, Fred Fleitz. \"There are a lot of bad options here,\" he told me, and the president is choosing the least bad one. \"When we leave, no one is going to be happy.\"\nThat is undoubtedly true. At the same time, Trump should approach the Syrian withdrawal with his eyes wide open. He may believe the U.S. can use its leverage with a NATO ally to make the best of the disaster in Syria."}

It was the third consecutive monthly gain since sales collapsed in September. The increase nearly pulled the sales rate even with the level of 545,000 in February 2015 and points to continued momentum for real estate and construction in the opening months of this year.\n\"This is a promising sign for the housing market as we move into 2016,\" said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance. \"We expect the strong increase in new home sales to continue as the fundamentals in the housing market remain strong and newer vintage homes are in short supply.\"\nSales of new homes accelerated sharply in 2015, rising 14.5 percent on the entire year to 501,000. Steady job growth that cut the unemployment rate to a healthy 5 percent has given many homebuyers increased confidence, while relatively low mortgage rates improved affordability. Yet sales of new homes continue to run below the 52-year historic average of 655,200, a sign of the severe hit absorbed by the market after the housing bubble burst.\nBuilders responded to the demand by increasing construction. Over the course of 2015, ground breakings rose 10.8 percent to 1.1 million. Yet supplies main relatively low with only 5.2 months' inventory of new homes available, down from 5.6 months in November.

But Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at the real estate firm Trulia, cautioned that this doesn't necessarily mean that affordability has improved for first-time buyers.\nOnly 19 percent of new-home sales were below $200,000 in 2015, a decrease from 23 percent in 2014.\n\"This is likely due to a combination of low inventory of new starter homes and fewer first-time homebuyers,\" McLaughlin said.\nStill, lower borrowing costs have helped reduce cost pressures and encourage sales, a trend likely to run through this year.\nMortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.81 percent last week from 3.92 percent a week earlier. Rates have historically averaged 6 percent, meaning that interest expenses are relatively low for homebuyers.\nThis story has been corrected to read that new-home sales climbed strongly in the Northeast, Midwest and West in December, instead of the Northeast, South and West."}

She heard about Palestine from her parents but has never seen it, and she considers Syria her homeland. More than anything, she yearns to return and to see her family whole again.\n\"Syria is the country that has fed us with its blessings,\" said al Hosary, 48, tears of homesickness and despair welling in her eyes. \"I'm a Palestinian by name only, and by my roots. But the air, the sun, the breath - it's Syrian. ... To me, Syria was paradise on earth. We never expected this to happen.\"\nNow she's one of an estimated 5 million Syrians in a terrible exodus from a country torn apart by war. She and her husband and daughter are stuck with about 14,000 others at the Greece-Macedonia border, where sharp stones poke up through the thin bottom of a small tent donated by the Red Cross that is their temporary home.\nThey are among the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees who fled home for Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Europe. Most of those who chose to try for new lives in Europe took rickety boats from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands in short but perilous journeys, heading north from there to richer countries like Germany and Sweden.\nAl Hosary's family is scattered across the continents. Her youngest son Emad is in Sweden - he made it there three years ago when he was just 17, after boarding a boat in Egypt bound for Italy and then making his way north. Smugglers paved the way, but the price - 6,500 dollars in all - was too high for the family to afford sending more than one person.\nNow all she, her husband and daughter want is to be reunited with him.\nShe sent him away right after her eldest son, who would now be 28, was arrested by the police in Syria while checking on the home they had fled in an area that came under rebel control. They haven't heard from him since.\nEmad was well-built and of military age, and al Hosary was terrified he would be next, or that soldiers would forcibly recruit him into the army.\nShe herself didn't want to leave Syria, a country she loves passionately. But after a while, staying just wasn't an option.\n\"My fear was for my husband and my daughter,\" al Hosary said. \"For me, I can sit at home and wait for my death. But they have to go to work.\" And going to work meant risking their lives.\n\"The shelling, the shelling, the shelling. War, war, war.

Among them, cease fire by Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad, and the Sunni Awakening.\nThe Awakening was made up of Sunnis who turned against al-Qaida in Iraq in their areas. The Americans paid them to take up arms against AQI and in some areas they were quite effective at driving out AQ fighters. They made a dramatic difference in Anbar province, which had been the insurgency's heartland.\nBut the whole \"surge\" was designed to give Iraqis time to create a political solution. Time that seems to have been frittered away to no end. And according to the New York Times, Al-Qaida is now recruiting Awakening members, with some success.\nAlthough there are no firm figures, security and political officials say hundreds of the well-disciplined fighters \u2014 many of whom have gained extensive knowledge about the American military \u2014 appear to have rejoined Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Beyond that, officials say that even many of the Awakening fighters still on the Iraqi government payroll, possibly thousands of them, covertly aid the insurgency.\nThe defections have been driven in part by frustration with the Shiite-led government, which Awakening members say is intent on destroying them, as well as by pressure from Al Qaeda. The exodus has accelerated since Iraq\u2019s inconclusive parliamentary elections in March, which have left Sunnis uncertain of retaining what little political influence they have and which appear to have provided Al Qaeda new opportunities to lure back fighters.\nThe Awakening members\u2019 switch in loyalties poses a new threat to Iraq\u2019s tenuous social and political balance during the country\u2019s ongoing political crisis and as the United States military prepares to withdraw next year."}

It's a huge untapped market that banks can't do,\" said Patrick Kane, vice president of strategic business at Ericsson.\nKane was referencing the long-time struggle between carriers and banks over which the provider will become the consumer's trusted partner for offering Internet and wireless services. \"At the sub-$15 level of revenues it doesn't justify banks doing it,\" added Kane.\nThe Content Delivery Solution at its core is based on adopting the latest version of Apple's QuickTime development platform for converting and compressing multimedia files to an MPEG4 format. MPEG4 is an IOS (International Organization for Standards) standard.\nApple has about 70 percent market share for multimedia content development, according to Kane, with RealNetworks owning about 15 percent. RealNetworks has committed to creating an MPEG4-compliant tool, said Kane.\nA Sun product manager said Sun's streaming capability is also available as a standalone product.\n\"Using MPEG file format we can stream other types of content. MPEG4 has containers and you can put anything in those containers and a company could put it in their portal,\" said Videhi Mallela, product manager at Sun in Palo Alto, Calif.\nAt the QuickTime show, the partners demonstrated streaming video being sent simultaneously to a desktop PC, a handheld, and a set-top box, all of which is billable, noted Kane.\nSun's streaming server technology is in beta and available now. Prototypes of the entire solution are currently being shown to operators. The solution will run on any data protocol wireless networks and not on circuit switched networks, said Kane."}

I don't know any Hooverites who think the last century was a triumph for small government and individual liberty. Look at the size of government since 1909. Look at the level of taxation. Look at the welfare state. Look at racial civil rights. Look at the role of women. The West is immeasurably more statist than it was a hundred years ago, and even the most dramatic counter-revolutionaries, such as Reagan and Thatcher, did very little to alter the contours of the state. The Bush Republicans implemented the biggest expansion of government power, debt and spending since LBJ.\nBut, look, Ingraham isn't really thinking here. This is a statement of doctrine, not politics, and all religions require a certain mythology (the idea that a conservative movement that began in the late 1950s extends backward to the earliest part of the century is truly religious thinking). So one can forgive the thoughtless hyperbole.\nWhat worries me is the slow transformation of what was a vital pragmatic adjustment to liberalism's policy failures in the 1980s into a kind of eternal dogma. But tax cuts are not always the solution to every emergent problem; global warfare may not be the best way to exercize American power in the multi-polar world we now live in; social change - a multi-racial society where women and gays seek and deserve full equality - should be imaginatively shaped by the right, not outright rejected on religious or nostalgic grounds."}
{"idx": "16581", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act.\nOver the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy.\nThe evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved.\nDespite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute. When it was passed in 1917, it prohibited classic spying. But it also banned interference with the draft and, after amendment in 1918, any criticism of the war effort.\nIn its earliest drafts, the act actually went further. The first draft gave the president power to ban the circulation of \u201cany information relating to the public defense.\u201d This limit on freedom of speech aroused critics who, even during wartime, argued that such powers were unconstitutional. As a result, Congress struck this provision from the bill.\nYet the Espionage Act remained powerful enough to pave the way for the modern regime of state secrecy. These powers were forged from the broad and vague clauses within the act that were left open for interpretation. Notably, the act prohibited circulating information \u201crelated to the national defense\u201d to those without authorization. But it didn\u2019t specify what, exactly, constituted information \u201crelated to the national defense.\u201d That\u2019s because the sections of the act that outlined the process for defining defense information and security authorization \u2014 and which had given the president broad powers over that process \u2014 had been cut in 1917 to protect press freedom.\nThe resulting ambiguity was left to the courts to decipher during the interwar years. Two cases in particular revealed the deep tensions between free speech rights and the protection of security information. In 1938, the Justice Department prosecuted two men, Mikhail Gorin and Hafis Salich, for transferring naval intelligence reports to the Soviet Union. And in 1941, it prosecuted Edmund Heine, a German automotive executive, for transferring information about the American air industry to Volkswagen in Nazi Germany.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the prosecution of Gorin and Salich in 1941, asserting that naval intelligence reports clearly fell within common understandings of \u201cnational defense\u201d information. But just four years later, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Heine\u2019s conviction. The opinion, written by famed Justice Learned Hand, concluded that information had to be kept \u201csecret\u201d if it was to qualify as \u201cnational defense\u201d information for the purposes of the Espionage Act.\nIn other words, if the government made no effort to conceal the information, then its circulation could not be a threat to national defense. As the Justice Department explained in a failed appeal of Hand\u2019s decision, such an interpretation of the Espionage Act meant that the state would simply need to keep more secrets.\nAt the same time, a small and obscure group within the wartime administrative apparatus, the Security Advisory Board, took the statute\u2019s application into its own hands and wrote new regulations to expand and solidify the protection of state secrets.\nIronically, 34 years after Congress refused to grant the president sweeping authority to regulate the circulation of defense information, the president successfully claimed that authority by executive order. Yet there has been little pushback,"}

When the earth is ripping by at a mile every few seconds, decisions must be made in far less time than that. Among the mistakes to be avoided are \"keeping your head in the cockpit\" - fixating on the multitude of instruments - or \"letting your scan break down\" (failing to constantly monitor what's happening both inside and outside the cockpit). Worst of all is \"getting behind the aircraft,\" or letting things happen faster than you can respond.\nThere are two reasons to fly this low and fast. One is training for war. Attackers approach targets this way to avoid enemy radar that controls antiaircraft artillery or surface-to-air missiles. Some pilots train to deliver tactical nuclear weapons this way, popping up at the last minute to toss the bomb at the target.\nIt's not the kind of thing one can learn on the job in wartime. Perfecting such maneuvers takes constant practice, and it is not without mishap or close calls.\nWhile practicing low-altitude \"over-the-shoulder\" bombing, I once pulled straight up into a cloud, began to get vertigo, and recovered only by flying straight back toward the ground, then pulling up in a gut-wrenching maneuver that rocketed me into Mexican airspace barely above the cactuses.\nThe other reason to fly low and fast is to show off, or \"flat hat.\" There are many tragic stories of people doing this.\nHiking in the Sierras, I once met two old codgers who complained about \"them jetters\" who spoiled their solitude. I kept my mouth shut, knowing of friends who often checked the water level in favorite trout streams this way.\nToday, legitimate training maneuvers still get mixed up with the impulse to stretch the allowable parameters just for fun - even to conduct a little impromptu air show to provide a cheap thrill for the earth-bound.\nSkiing in Oregon's Siskiyou Mountains last year, my wife and I paused at the summit to take in the view. At that moment, two F-16s exploded past in a thunderous roar - below us and so close we could see the pilots' helmets.\n* Brad Knickerbocker flew A-4 Skyhawk attack jets in the US Navy.\nJohn McCain's air war over Vietnam.

As prime minister, it was his first and last pronouncement on national cultural life \u2013 a surprising fact, given that in the speech he advanced the idea that the UK was in the midst of an artistic golden age.\nBut if Blair was right, it is worth asking this: why do so many significant British artists now live and work overseas? Liverpool's Simon Rattle is at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic, and unlikely ever to move back to the UK. London-born Steve McQueen, who represented Britain at the Venice Biennale this year (and won huge acclaim for his 2008 film Hunger), lives in Amsterdam. Glaswegian artist Douglas Gordon is in Berlin, as are Tacita Dean and Ceal Floyer. M.I.A., the singer-songwriter-artist, is resident in New York. Daniel Harding, an outstandingly talented young British conductor, calls Paris home and works with orchestras in Berlin and Sweden. Conductor Jonathan Nott lives in Switzerland; artist Chris Ofili lives in Trinidad, as does the painter Peter Doig. The list goes on. Is this a brain drain?\nFor many of these artists, their initial uprooting was never meant to be permanent. Harding, 33, became Claudio Abbado's assistant at the Berlin Philharmonic at 19. Composer Richard Ayres, born in Cornwall in 1965, left the UK 20 years ago (\"It certainly wasn't a golden age then \u2013 we didn't have Tony Blair, we had Mrs Thatcher\"). Nott, chief conductor of the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra in Bavaria, which recently brought the house down at the Proms, left in 1989. \"The intention was to find out more about German opera and learn the language, and then do the same in Italy,\" he says. But the training available in Germany was off the scale compared to that in the UK. \"When I went to Germany, there were 56 opera houses. You just can't learn to be a conductor by sitting on your own in a room. I could not have got that experience in the UK.\" Dean moved to Berlin in 2000, on a scholarship for a year, with no plans beyond that.\nThe real question, then, is not why these artists chose to leave, but why they have stayed away. Berlin-based composer Rebecca Saunders, in residence with the Dresden Staatskapelle, tells me that while her music is occasionally performed in the UK (the Staatskapelle brought one of her new works to the Proms last month), her British career is relatively insignificant. She moved to Berlin for good in 1997, and has stayed because the commissions (from German ensembles and festivals) have come in fast. \"People wanted to work with me, and I did not feel the need to justify myself and my music. I was in an environment where my ears were constantly surprised. I felt free to be creative and seek my own voice.

CBS (Charts) saw its average rights fee rise nearly 25 percent under new NFL package, while News Corp.'s (Charts) Fox is pay nearly 30 percent more.\nSee why Sunday nights could dominate.\nBut while Disney (Charts) seems to have gotten the hit with the worst sticker shock, it bought a lot more with that money than a chance to let Tony Kornheiser annoy fans who haven't had anyone to hate since Dennis Miller was shown the door.\nSimply put, it let ESPN keep a stranglehold on the cable sports industry, and cable subscriber fees.\nIf Disney had turned down the NFL deal, it could have opened the door for Fox to launch a true national sports cable network. Instead, Fox's cable sports business remains a collection of regional networks.\nOr it could have given Comcast (Charts), which once wanted to buy Disney to get its hands on ESPN, the chance to turn OLN, soon to be renamed Versus, into more than just a curiosity in the world of cable sports networks.\nThere was even talk that Turner Broadcasting (a unit of Time Warner (Charts) that also owns CNNMoney.com), might have wanted to add the NFL to its basketball and auto racing offerings to create a stronger sports competitor.\n\"It's all strategic,\" said Neal Pilson, a sports broadcasting consultant who was formerly president of CBS Sports. \"Not only would [ESPN] have had a stronger competitor overnight, but they would have a hard time justifying their subscriber fees. They needed the NFL to maintain and grow their cable subscriber fees.\"\nESPN got an estimated $2.60 every month from cable operators in 2005 for each of its 90.1 million subscribers, according to Kagan Research. This year Kagan estimates fees will rise to $2.91 every month from 93.2 million subscribers. That works out to an extra $443 million in fees in 2006, a 15 percent jump from last year.\nStill, Disney is almost certain to lose money on the new NFL contract, but then again, it's likely the other four partners will lose money as well. But because ESPN can draw on both subscriber fees as well as advertising dollars, it might very well lose less than the NFL's other broadcast partners.\n\""}

Another fall towards the lower border of the channel is still possible later today, a clear break below the channel support will indicate that the upward movement from 0,9463 has completed, then deeper decline could be seen to 0.9600 zone. However, a break above 0.9928 will indicate that the uptrend from 0.9463 has resumed, then another rise to 1.0000 could be seen.\nThe adoption of the single European currency in late 1999 had a mixed effect on currency transfer operations and the overall economic performance of the European Union (EU). It lowered some costs but spurred doubts about the ability of national governments to control financial markets in times of crisis. Doubts notwithstanding, the euro has already become a major world reserve currency and is bound to grow even stronger if it manages to replace the U.S. dollar as the oil trading currency.\nSpeaking about currency transfer operations within the EU, one must admit that the introduction of the single currency benefited individual and business clients because it brought the costs of currency conversion across the continent to naught, thus downsizing the cost of currency transfers. However, the adoption of the euro in the Eurozone resulted in a single monetary policy determined by the European Central Bank, which left little room for national governments to manoeuvre in times of trouble. Moreover, different levels of inflation and unemployment levels within the Eurozone and the EU as a whole were among the factors that have recently been fanning the fire of financial troubles in Europe.\nObviously, euro adoption was a factor to strengthen European financial markets in terms of liquidity because businesses and governments have more sources of funding and are not limited by local currency barriers to borrowing money and gave fresh start to European financial markets.\nAfter its introduction in late 1999 the euro started to depreciate against the dollar and following a series of volatile moves in May 2009 it slid to an exchange rate tantamount to its initial trading value. Meanwhile, individual and institutional brokers around the world managed to heavily profit on these currency fluctuations, and transfers entailing conversion from one currency to another was a matter of survival for some companies. Later, the euro continued to gain against the U.S. currency but the recent recovery of the American economy helped the dollar restore its positions and now it is evident that it finally lost its leading role as the world\u201d??s reserve currency.\nMany countries already switched to the euro as a reserve currency and even the oil-rich countries of OPEC are considering options to start trading oil in euro. Such a move will most likely initially shake the financial markets because many currency transfers denominated so far in U.S. dollars will be lastingly switching to the euro.\nEuro adoption has its disadvantages, too. The major one is that at present national governments within the Eurozone can only rely on fiscal policy and public investment to adjust economic policy to the needs of specific regions and countries. In times of financial crisis and dangerously high budget deficits across Europe, countries like the United Kingdom, which is not a member of the Eurozone, have more room to act and manipulate the exchange rate of the pound to achieve better economic results. The Bank of England can take measures to devalue the British currency and ease access to cheaper credits, while countries like Greece, which belongs to the Eurozone, is not allowed to do so. On the other hand, positive effects outweigh negatives and most financial analysts are of opinion that the euro has a bright future ahead of it.\nThis week is"}

You can take some pains in the short-term as long as the right things are happening in the long-term,\" Sharma said.\nShe said the NCLT-based resolution mechanism is aimed at \"doing the right things for the medium- to long-term\".\nAxis Bank's strategy is also aligned with the same thought of ensuring gains in the long-term, she added.\nThe comments come even as reports say that in case of Essar Steel, one of the earliest and the largest accounts mandated by the RBI to be resolved through the NCLT, the promoter Ruia family has teamed up with the Russian lender VTB to wrest back the company through the bidding.\nEssar Steel has a debt of over Rs 45,000 crore and a joint venture of Arcelor Mittal and Japanese alloy major Nippon Steel is the lone competitor for the Ruias' bid being done through a firm called Neumetal in which a Ruia family member owns 25 per cent through a Mauritius-based trust.\nWhen asked if promoters are getting a backdoor entry by teaming up with other investors and where does that leave the concerns on credit culture, Sharma said, \"I think we are jumping the gun.\"\nSharma also welcomed the NCLT process as a very strong and responsive mechanism which has shown a willingness to change if there is a need.\n\"One should recognise NCLTs for the fact that it is seldom that you see that a legislation gets written and implemented as quickly as NCLT...In the next three-four months we'll have a better idea of exactly how the whole NCLT process has worked,\" she said.\nWhen asked about the loss of credit culture through farm loan waivers across various states, Sharma acknowledged about the difficulties but declined to elaborate.\n\"Every time there is a"}

And what if that deal is an American capitulation to Iran allowing the Ayatollahs to preserve their facilities for breaking out for A-bombs? After the US has agreed to lifting the economic sanctions and allowing Iran to get back on its feet, there is conjecture that Obama is ready to let Iran keep its nuclear capabilities in return for Tehran's aid in cutting back its subversive role in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East and beyond.\nThis would be an Obama attempt for a short term gain - allowing him to reach 'a peace in HIS time' with Iran until he leaves office. But this would be at the cost of a long term strategic blunder as a whole, while also putting Israel in peril. It would be tantamount to a twenty-first century Munich.\nTake this one step forward: Israel would then have to decide whether to go it alone and attempt to destroy Iran's facilities. The Jewish state, even including its Left wing leaders such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, concurred that the Jewish people must 'never again' be faced with a second Holocaust. If an Obama sell-out to Iran is in the works, Netanyahu has made clear that he would follow the preventative strike policy of the Likud's Menachem Begin in destroying Saddam Hussein's nuclear facility in 1981, and Left-winger Ehud Olmert in 2007, who reportedly ordered the Israel Air Force to bomb the secret reactor that North Korea was building for Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nIf this scenario is true, Netanyahu might be planning to reveal to the U.S. Congress its secret intelligence about the nuclear deal with Iran. Perhaps he is still hoping that it's not too late to persuade America not to capitulate. Otherwise what is the alternative? Israel will be faced with going it alone. I, for one, believe there would be an Israeli consensus for attacking Iran to prevent Iran from going nuclear. In other words, Netanyahu may be going to Washington to stop Israel from launching a necessary pre-emptive military strike to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons.\nIf this scenario is true...Netanyahu may be going to Washington to stop Israel from launching a necessary pre-emptive military strike to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons.\nBut what of the argument that Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani is not just a smiling con artist out to dupe Obama, but is really succeeding in guiding Iran on a more moderate track. Nearly all the experts agree that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards are still calling the shots. Just look at the new Iranian budget - even though the sanctions have caused economic hardship, food subsidies, and civilian services have been further slashed, the military budget, particularly for the hard line Revolutionary Guards, has been sharply increased.\n\"The Americans are begging us for a deal at the negotiating table.\"\nThis jibes with the statement of a senior administration official, who actually disclosed after the President's re-election. that a deal with Iran would be the crowning glory of Obama's second term.

After Colorado\u2019s 2012 vote legalizing marijuana, local leaders concerned about crime and the character of their tranquil downtown twice voted to ban the recreational and medical pot shops springing up in other towns.\nBut then coal crumbled. One mine here in the North Fork Valley has shut down amid a wave of coal bankruptcies and slowdowns, and another has announced that it will go dark. The closings added to a landscape of layoffs and economic woes concussing mining-dependent towns from West Virginia to Wyoming. And as Hotchkiss searches for a new economic lifeline, some people are asking: What about marijuana?\nNext month, Hotchkiss will vote on whether to undo its ban and welcome marijuana shops and the traffic and taxes that could come with them. With cannabis sales soaring to nearly $1 billion across Colorado, and big states such as California poised to embrace legalization, wary towns like Hotchkiss are looking at the economics of marijuana and starting to reconsider.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an evolving discussion in a lot of communities,\u201d said Kevin Bommer, deputy director of the Colorado Municipal League, which tracks local debates on the issue. Six Colorado towns are voting in April on whether to scrap their prohibitions on marijuana stores, and in January, another narrowly voted to lift a moratorium and approve wholesale marijuana growers.\nThough 23 states and the District of Columbia now allow some forms of recreational or medical marijuana, legalization is still a checkerboard, with marijuana retailers and cultivations clustered in big cities such as Seattle or Washington and scattered randomly through rural areas.\nAs scores of cities and counties banned marijuana sales, they cited worries about public safety, property values, youth use and the image problems that might come with becoming their county\u2019s go-to source for legal marijuana. Others passed moratoriums to wait and see how legalization unfolded in neighboring towns that plunged in.\nPlaces like Pierce County, south of Seattle, discovered that simply banning dispensaries did not keep out marijuana. In February 2015, the police shut down an illegal grow house next to a day care center in Gig Harbor. The County Council passed a series of what it called tight regulations, and in December repealed its ban on marijuana sales and production in unincorporated corners of the county.\nHere in Hotchkiss, the push to allow marijuana has touched off conversations about the soul of the town. It is tucked into a sunny mountain valley draped with peach orchards and vineyards. But the coal mines up the valley were an economic mainstay for generations, and people say that tourism and boutique agriculture cannot replace good-paying mining jobs. Unemployment here in Delta County is 5.3 percent, higher than the statewide average of 3.2 percent.\n\u201cPeople have been tightening the belt or just plain moving away,\u201d said Robbie Winne, who runs the Rose, a secondhand clothing shop along Hotchkiss\u2019 main street. She said she supported the marijuana plan as a way to entice more visitors, or at least capture some traffic as people passed through on their way to ski towns.\nWinne said that although pot was no panacea, at least it could perk up business and tax revenue. Colorado collected about $135 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales last year, and small governments have taken in millions from local sales taxes.

Both were taken to Milford Memorial Hospital and one was later transported to Christiana Hospital. Police said one victim was shot in the stomach area and the other victim was shot in the leg. No suspects have been announced and the shooting remains under investigation.\nOn May 3, officers again returned to Brightway for a report of shots fired. This time there were no victims, but property was damaged. Five days later, Bridgeville resident Ronnier Elmore, 25, was arrested in connection with the shooting, as well as another one on May 5 in a different part of town.\nHours after Elmore was arrested, gunshots again were heard in Brightway. That investigation remains open and no suspects have been identified. No injuries or property damage were reported, police said.\n\u201cI think the last few could be possibly linked,\u201d said Milford Police Department Detective Cpl. Timothy Maloney. He said he does not suspect the April shooting is connected to the two in May.\n\u201cIt all depends on further investigative leads we need to follow up on,\u201d he said.\nMaloney said his department is stepping up surveillance efforts in an area they say is an on-and-off hotspot for violent crime, and the department is working with property managers to update lighting and surveillance cameras.\nOver the last 12 months, police have been called to Brightway more than 200 times for everything from disorderly conduct and domestic disputes to thefts and assaults. The three recent shootings are the only ones in Brightway that have been reported over the last year.\nMaloney said it\u2019s difficult to say whether the recent shootings constitute a crime trend in the area, but incidents have been increasing.\nHe said most shootings occur well after school is dismissed at nearby Benjamin Banneker Elementary School, which is staffed with school resource officers and other security measures.\nBrightway has seen its fair share of violent crime in recent years. In May 2016, a 21-year-old man was critically injured after he was shot in a parking lot at the complex. In August 2015, a man fired multiple rounds into one of the lower-level apartment buildings, but no injuries were reported.\nSo far this year, Milford police have received seven reports of shots fired, three of which occurred in Brightway, Maloney said. He said six of those seven reports were confirmed to be gunfire.\nIn 2017, Milford saw three shootings that resulted in injuries, one of which was fatal and none of which occurred at Brightway, according to police reports.\nLast year, police reported 283 shootings statewide that resulted in injuries or deaths. That number does not include shots fired complaints.\nOne lifelong resident said she remembers when police would regularly patrol the neighborhood and ask anyone outside their homes to show identification. She said she does not see that anymore.\nMaloney said police are increasing patrols, but the residents said they haven\u2019t noticed. Or when they do see police in the neighborhood, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re just passing through. Maloney said they are keeping a"}

Instead, its accounts and associated MasterCard debit card are backed by CBW Bank, an FDIC member based in Kansas.\nAlso like Simple, Moven\u2019s focus is more so on the front-end of banking \u2013 that is, the consumer-facing user experience. Within the mobile application, users have access to real-time updates and spending alerts, spending analysis across all their bank cards and credit cards, the ability to send money to friends from the app via Facebook, email or their mobile number, and the ability to suspend and unsuspend their account directly from the app in the case of a lost or stolen card, among other things.\nYou\u2019re even able to see a map of your social events (courtesy of the Facebook integration) and how those coincide with spending behaviors. The company says around half its users connect with Facebook to tap into Moven\u2019s social features.\nOverall, the idea here is that what many consumers today want from their banks are better ways to help them spend and manage their money, and traditional banks don\u2019t really deliver on this. But what makes Moven a bit different from Simple, which also targets this group of consumers with its ease-of-use and spending analysis features, is that Moven gives users the ability to manage other bank accounts and card accounts within its app. That way, Moven can offer a more complete financial picture of someone\u2019s accounts, since they can see their activity across other banks and cards from the app.\nThe Moven mobile application itself is not new to be clear. The app first debuted in mid-2013, and was initially friend and family focused before launching its early invite list. However, this is the first time that users have been able to sign up for their Moven account within the application itself.\nDespite having been closed to the broader public, Moven has grown to 5,000 registered users and over 100,000 have signed up for invites. And it has helped manage over $300 million in customer spending. (The company declined to say how much is has in funds under management, however). Around 60% of Moven\u2019s users link at least two external accounts, we\u2019re told.\nCurrently, Moven provides customers with a plastic card as well as a MasterCard PayPass sticker, which you can affix to the back of your phone for contactless payments at supported point-of-sale terminals. Going forward, Moven is looking into launching Host Card Emulation (HCE) so it can do away with the need for plastic in future versions. It will also be beefing up security features \u2013 for example, alerting customers if fraudulent spending is suspected.\nThe NYC-based company has raised $4.4 million in funding from various fintech investors and angels like Kevin Plank, founder and CEO of UnderArmour, plus Esther Dyson and David Rose.\nMoven is available for both iOS and Android."}

Academicians said that a growing reliance on laptops has led to students' writing becoming increasingly illegible.\nDr Sarah Pearsall, a senior lecturer at Cambridge's history faculty who was involved with the pilot earlier this year, said that handwriting is becoming a \"lost art\" among the current generation of students.\n\"Fifteen or twenty years ago students routinely have written by hand several hours a day -- but now they write virtually nothing by hand except exams,\" she added.\nA consultation has been launched by the Cambridge University on the topic as part of its \"digital education strategy\", having already piloted an exam typing scheme in the history and classics faculties earlier this year, The Telegraph reported.\n\"As a faculty, we have been concerned for years about the declining handwriting problem. There has definitely been a downward trend. It is difficult for both the students and the examiners as it is harder and harder to read these scripts,\" Sarah said.\nPearsall said that an increasing number of scripts are having to be transcribed centrally, meaning that students with illegible writing are forced to come back to their college during the summer holidays to read their answers aloud in the presence of two university administrators.\nShe said it is \"extraordinarily commendable\" that the university is considering reforms to its examination practices.\nBut it seems that not everyone favours this move. Some have voiced fears that the \"handwritten word (could) become a matter of nostalgia.\"\nTracey Trussell, a handwriting expert at the British Institute of Graphologists, urged Cambridge to \"make sure that students continue to write by hand, particularly in lectures.\"\n\"Certainly with social media, iPads, and all the rest of it, people do clearly use keyboards much more than they would hand write.

Current Lifestyle Marketing has a good example from last September when it revealed results from a study on Millennial moms.\nIn addition to expanding how brands research and market to Millennials, they need to start remembering all the other generations, such as Generation X and Baby Boomers.\nJust a few weeks ago Whole Foods announced a plan to develop a new innovative, less expensive grocery chain for Millennials. The day after the announcement, the company\u2019s shares dipped 9%. Maybe stockholders find the idea as unnecessary as I do.\nAccording to a Nielsen survey, one-third of Millennials say healthy food is very important, and 29% say they\u2019re very willing to pay premium prices for healthier products.\nIf Whole Foods wants to create a new line of affordable stores, instead of offering more affordable products within existing locations, it should look at other generational groups too.\nGen X \u2013 the oft forgotten middle child of the Millennials and Baby Boomers \u2013 has the highest amount of debt of any generation in the US right now, according to Experian.\nAlso, people tend to think Baby Boomers have more disposable income because many within the group are retired, but the generation is actually being weighed down by debt from helping kids or grandkids with student loans. An analysis of government data by LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute states that education debt for Baby Boomers is six times what it was 25 years ago, putting the group in financial hardship at the time of retirement.\nAside from financial issues, both of these generations are just as important as Millennials from a marketing and communications perspective.

I learned at the meeting that children make up about one-third of the shelter populations in the Baltimore area.\nIt is important to consider life from a communal mindset. We often succumb to an anthill mentality, leaving us to ignore the bustling lives or dreary days of those we pass along the way.

It's incredible.\" He boasted about his era-spanning reach, noting that while he interviewed Alan Thicke on his prior show, \"This time I'll have Robin Thicke.\"\nArsenio Hall: In the Sept. 8 Calendar section, an article about Arsenio Hall said that his talk show will air on 17 Tribune stations in roughly half the nation. While that is true, the talk show will air on a total of 180 stations, making it available to virtually the entire country.\nProducers said the show \u2014 which debuts Monday \u2014 will sample the past. \"Arsenio wants it to look like he stopped on a Friday night in 1994, took a long weekend and came back on a Monday night in 2013,\" executive producer Neal Kendall said in an interview. \"It's a 21st century version of what he did so well the first time around.\"\nBut Hall and his producers are downplaying several aspects of his legacy that clouded his five-year tenure and may cast a shadow over his chances in an even more competitive environment. They are positioning him like a triumphant champion returning to battle rather than an under-the-radar entertainer whose star power had greatly dimmed by the time his once-hot show flamed out.\nObscured are the factors behind his gradual decline: A puffy interview style.

The House Judiciary Committee is investigating in a move that is seen as \u201ca big step toward [perhaps] launching formal impeachment hearings.\u201d Meanwhile, New York state regulators are looking into the Trump organization\u2019s dealings with an insurance company after Cohen testified that the family business provided inflated asset information to insurers.\nPolling suggests that Americans are concerned: a Quinnipiac survey this week showed Trump\u2019s approval rating at 38%, with 62% saying they believe the president committed crimes before taking office, and a plurality of 45% saying the president has committed crimes while in office.\nCriminal law doesn\u2019t depend on opinion polls, of course, but none of this is good news for the president. Trump still has two things going for him, though: (1) as long as he hangs on to support from at least 34 of the 53 sitting Republican senators, he can\u2019t be removed from office before 2021 and (2) as long as he remains in office, it is possible he may not be subject to indictment or prosecution. However, any protections against the machinery of the criminal justice system certainly would disappear once Trump leaves office.\nWith his many legal woes, Trump may have more on the line in the 2020 election than just the presidency.\nAll of which adds up to an inescapable conclusion: with his many legal woes, Trump may have more on the line in the 2020 election than just the presidency. It looks pretty clear what his strategy for political survival will be. First, Trump will seek to fire up his base by focusing on divisive issues like the Mexican border wall. Second, he will try to demonize his opponent, and the Democratic party in general.\nThis second point will probably be a smorgasbord affair \u2014 Democrats will be smeared as everything from enemies of the people tobaby killers.

But it might find fertile ground in 2019. A Fox News poll taken last month found 57% of registered voters had a favorable opinion of capitalism, while just 25% had a favorable opinion of socialism.\nWhether Trump\u2019s 21st Century version of red-baiting succeeds may depend in part on how the term socialism is understood by journalists and voters. As political scientist Sheri Berman explains, the term \u201csocialism has multiple meanings and interpretations.\u201d Trump is hoping to gain traction for the idea that socialism = dictatorship, and for the preposterous claim that Democrats are bent on tyranny, in the mold of Venezuelan autocrat Nicolas Maduro.

A few sections of the proposed agreement are provided below, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of Americans to keep and bear arms as protected by the Second Amendment.\nTo begin, the Preamble of the Arms Trade Treaty points to the United Nations Charter as the source of guiding principles upon which the agreement is based. Citizens of the United States, however, recognize God as the source of all rights they enjoy.

While the governments of the 50 states of the United States may exercise such control as part of their police power, the Second Amendment explicitly forbids the federal government from infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\nGiven that the Arms Trade Treaty specifically grants the UN and \u201cstate parties\u201d exclusive control over the manufacture, purchase, possession, sale, trade, and transfer of weapons of every size \u2014 from handgun to intercontinental missile \u2014 how can it claim to be the best hope of protecting women and children from armed conflict? In fact, in nearly every case of mass killings by government, the people targeted were first disarmed, leaving all weapons in the hands of government, preventing the people from resisting the march of tyranny.\n(h) Small arms and light weapons.\nAs the representative of one pro-gun control organization told this reporter last week, \u201cGuns without bullets are no deadlier than baseball bats.\u201d The UN plans to eventually rid the world of privately owned weapons; failing to do that, however, they will prevent the purchase (or reloading) of ammunition.\nReports around the country reveal that shortages of ammunition are already leaving many without rounds to use in their lawfully owned firearms.\nArticle 4 rounds out the regulations, placing all \u201cparts and components\u201d of weapons within the scheme, as well.\nShould the U.S. delegation vote in favor of this treaty (and President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have both signaled that they should), the federal government will be obligated to begin compiling a list of who owns, buys, sells, trades, or transfers any of the weapons included in the list provided above, as well as the ammunition, parts, and components of those weapons.\nThat\u2019s right.

Ditton pointed out many CIOs currently report into the CFO, and that CFOs own the business case for technology and are the dominant voice for IT on the board.\n\u201cThere is a real opportunity for CIOs to engage with their CFOs to demonstrate how IT is instrumental to the way the business operates, instrumental to cost efficiencies, and instrumental to the way growth can be driven across the organisation,\u201d she added.\nIDC\u2019s research found the CFO\u2019s primary focus is on increasing efficiencies and reducing cost. Ditton claimed cloud-based services are the optimum delivery mechanism in achieving that, and will also ensure the CIO remains central in the long-term competitiveness of the business.\n\u201cWhat has come out of our CFO office at a global level is that over the next five years, organisations expect to move from a zero capital model through the use of public cloud,\u201d Ditton said.\nAcross the board, top business concerns for c-level executives in 2014 are finding new customers, expanding into new markets and retaining their customer base.

The RFP was being administered by a third party for an unnamed company, and we were given 2 business days to turn around a response. Though these two factors made me highly suspicious, I decided to give the rest of the RFP a look to qualify it further. You shouldn\u2019t rule out a strategic sourcing business opportunity on these bases alone. So I looked at the actual RFP content. That\u2019s when I noticed that the RFP was riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. \u201cFebruray,\u201d \u201cservces,\u201d \u201cStandarization\u201d\u2013 and there were a lot more. Now, we get it \u2013 sourcing people don\u2019t need to be eloquent writers and perfect spellers to do their job well. But we do expect them to use a handy dandy tool called Spell Check (guess what? Spell Check works in Excel, too!). The whole thing reeked of a rush job that was not quality checked.\nIf you are entrusting a procurement services provider to represent your company\u2019s interests, to build relationships with potential vendors \u2013 you need make sure that they don\u2019t give participants the impression that they don\u2019t take this project seriously enough to use spell check. How can you expect potential vendors to take the opportunity seriously if, as far as they know, you don\u2019t?\nRemember that in many cases, when you are dealing with services organizations - the people who develop proposals aren\u2019t just sitting around twiddling their thumbs until an RFP comes along. They are fielding inquiries from dozens of potential customers at a time \u2013 and if they\u2019re a reputable industry player \u2013 they are custom-developing proposals and Scopes of Work that best meet their customers\u2019 requirements. In other words, a good procurement services provider is not simply taking their \u201cProposal Template X\u201d off the shelf, slapping your company\u2019s logo on it, and sending it over to you expecting you to sign on in short order. Any procurement services provider worth their salt is likely investing hours and hours of their valuable time and pulling in Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from billable work to carefully craft a detailed proposal and supporting documentation to differentiate themselves from their competitors.\nBut let me take a breath here. Maybe I am being too dramatic. We\u2019re just talking about some spelling mistakes, right? Spelling errors in an RFP aren\u2019t the end of the world / incontrovertible evidence of bad sourcing. Well - we\u2019d be willing to look past spelling and grammar mistakes in an otherwise solid RFP."}

The four-week average ticked up 1,000 to 240,000.\nThe number of people receiving benefits fell 39,000 to 2 million, the department said.

In late February, applications fell to 210,000, the lowest since 1969, according to the revised data.\nMany businesses complain they are having trouble finding qualified workers to hire for their open jobs, which probably makes layoffs less likely.\nKEY DRIVERS: Hiring has been healthy since the beginning of the year, pushing the unemployment rate down a bit.\nEmployers added an average of 236,500 jobs in January and February, up from a monthly average of about 180,000 last year.

His book A People's History of the United States has sold over two million copies. Welcome back to OpEdNews, Howard. The dust has had a chance to settle a bit since last month's airing of your documentary \"The People Speak.\" What kind of feedback have you gotten so far?\nWe've received lots of nice messages on \"The People Speak.\" The History Channel tells us that eight million people have seen part or all of the film, and two million on the first night it was shown (apparently they have no way of telling if a viewer cuts out on the program). It will be on the History Channel again February 22nd and March 1st.\nThat's impressive and must be gratifying for all of you involved in the project. There's still another half hour of new material in the DVD that is being released next month, correct? What haven't we seen yet?\nYes, Joan, the History Channel program is 90 minutes, the DVD two hours. A bunch of readings we had no room for in the TV version: Marisa Tomei reading a Lowell mill girl of the 1830s, Benjamin Bratt reading an ex-slave responding to his master who wants him back, Danny Glover reading a black state legislator in Georgia responding to his expulsion from the legislature, Kerry Washington reading Fannie Lou Hamer, Marisa reading Cindy Sheehan, Sean Penn reading Kevin Tillman (brother of football star Pat Tillman killed in Afghanistan). And more, including the singer Pink with her song, \"Dear Mr. President.\"\nI read that there was a huge amount, something like 97 hours, of raw footage. So much wonderful material ended up on the cutting room floor. How ever did you decide what went in?\nA big question. We wanted the most dramatic readings, and the ones most relevant to what is happening today.\nI'm sure that generated some lively discussions. In the film, you touched on the difference between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, penned only a few years later. I'd like to know more. Why was there a shift in the attitude of the framers of the Constitution?\nNo change of attitude. One was a manifesto, rhetoric to rally people. The other a legal document, expressing their real desires.\nThis small but important difference seemed to signify something larger. The Declaration's original phrasing \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" was tweaked, becoming \"life, liberty and property\" in the Constitution, neatly encapsulating the tension between democratic and aristocratic principles. That tension continues to this day. We may not have landed gentry and inherited titles on these shores but we do have Big Business, which consistently rides roughshod over the interests of the rest of society. On that note, would you like to comment on the Supreme Court's decision last week to strike down corporate campaign finance limits?\nLiberals get excited about things like that as if they signal a dramatic change. No, the corporations ran our elections before the decision and will do so now -- just with a fig leaf of \"legality.\" The designation of corporations as \"persons\" which started in 1886 is just proof of how our legal system, the Constitution, the courts have always been tools of the wealthy classes.\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same.

It\u2019s also free to explore other funding streams.\nA spokesperson for the university clarified that the researchers would be free to ignore the company\u2019s guidance and that Facebook would not be sitting on any of its advisory boards. But if Facebook has some influence \u2013 however benign \u2013 on the subjects researchers are exploring, it may threaten the centre\u2019s independence.

The incident sent shockwaves through the university sector, and served as a warning to any research centre taking funding from those it\u2019s expected to critique.\nWhile some universities have refused to take funding from tech firms that could compromise their research, it\u2019s not uncommon for Silicon Valley giants to fund academic studies. Nor is it uncommon for academics to tell journalists they are unwilling to comment on particular issues because they concern firms who fund them.\nIf the experts paid to scrutinise these companies cannot afford to criticise them, then something has gone very wrong with the system. Universities must ensure that the funding they hope will liberate their researchers does not end up gagging them instead.\nOscar Williams is editor of the NewStatesman's sister site NSTech."}

With voters set to hit the polls later in the year, state lawmakers put together a map that included 12 districts whose voting-age population was at least 55 percent black.\nInitially a three-judge panel upheld the map as constitutional, but the judges reversed course after the Supreme Court determined they had applied the wrong standard for 11 of the districts.\nSetting the stage for this morning\u2019s appeal in Washington, the District Court found the map an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\nIn addition to the question of whether lawmakers focused too much on race when drawing the map, the justices spent a significant portion of arguments today on whether lawmakers should even have been able to appeal.\nThe Virginia House of Delegates was not an original defendant in the case, but intervened to defend the map in District Court.\nPaul Clement, an attorney for state lawmakers with the firm Kirkland & Ellis, noted Monday that Virginia\u2019s attorney general was happy to let the House defend the law while before the District Court, and only reconsidered when the case went up to the Supreme Court. He said this should allow the House to carry the appeal.\n\u201cThey forfeited the ability to insist that they have the exclusive right to represent the commonwealth,\u201d Clement said, referring to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\u201cMr. Clement, that\u2019s a pretty extreme statement on your part,\u201d Sotomayor said.\nArguing the House does not have standing, Virginia Solicitor General Toby Heytens said that allowing the chamber to carry the appeal would empower lawmakers to challenge a wide range of election laws. Heytens also said the Virginia attorney general has the sole authority to defend the state\u2019s laws.\nJustice Samuel Alito asked, however, if the fact that the House will likely need to spend money on administrative issues coming from changes to the map should allow the chamber to step up and defend the map.\nWhen arguments turned to the evaluation of the map, Clement said lawmakers only considered race when constructing the map to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Clement also contended that the District Court panel should have credited testimony from the map drawers to this end.\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019re going to deem their testimony not just incredible in certain particulars but across the board, then you\u2019re left with Hamlet without the prince,\u201d Clement said.\nPerkins Coie attorney Marc Elias, arguing for the voters who challenged the map, said the District Court\u2019s credibility determinations were reasonable and that the Legislature was at fault for sticking so rigidly to the 55 percent black voting-age population baseline. He said the House should have given more care to each individual district rather than aiming for a specific voter makeup for all 12.\n\u201cYour honor, had the commonwealth of Virginia done even a modicum of district-by-district analysis, this would be a very different case,\u201d Elias said.\nJust like on the question of standing, the justices were divided on the core issue of whether the redistricting effort was a racial gerrymander.\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed Elias on what the court should do with the fact that the first time the three-judge panel heard the case, it found the lawmakers\u2019 testimony credible"}

Google Music is available to anyone in the US without an invitation requirement, and includes the ability to upload 20,000 songs to the cloud for free.\nGoogle Music will have an app for Windows, Mac and Linux devices that will help you upload songs to the cloud, and the songs uploaded to the cloud can be either streamed or \"pinned\" for offline listening. The Android Market music store will include millions of songs, sortable by genre, sub genre, top albums, and top songs.\nThere are Staff Picks and a New Releases section, song prices range between $0.99 and $1.29 and every song is 320kbps MP3s with 90 second previews for each song. There will be a new free song every day and the first one is David Bowie's \"Sound and Vision\", Google have said there will be hundreds of free songs from the get-go. Big major labels have joined in, such as Universal, EMI and Sony music, as well as a number of smaller, independent labels.\nGoogle claim to have over 1,000 labels and 13 million tracks with 8 million tracks available today. To the surprise of many, six never-before-released Rolling Stones concerts will be made available on Google Music (with one available now and the remaining five to roll out before the end of the year). Busta Rhymes will be debuting his new album exclusively on Google Music, with his new single coming today. Coldplay, Shakira, Pearl Jam, and Dave Matthews Band will also provide exclusive concerts.\nWhere Google have done it different, is \"Artist Hubs\", for musicians who want to make customized pages. Within Artist Hubs, they can upload and sell their music through Google, kind of like an independent label. There's just a $25 once-off \"artist registration fee\" but the artists get to control the pricing of each song with a split of 70/30, Google taking the smaller share.\nGoogle+ integration is also another big part of Google Music, if you share a song with a friend, they'll be able to hear the entire song, not just the 90 second preview. Android 2.2 and above devices should start seeing the music store for Android as it rolls in over the coming days."}

{"idx": "16703", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Jennifer Mehaffey was lucky to have enjoyed a seven-month leave to be with and breastfeed her baby daughter before going back to work full-time.\nOnce she returned to her job, her goal was to supply breast milk for her daughter's first full year, said Mehaffey, 31, a marketing and public relations professional in Tuscaloosa, Ala. She pumped milk in her office at least three times a day, she said, until keeping up with it interfered with the many long meetings and client calls she had to juggle.\nThen \"the incident\" happened. A male co-worker who was new to the job was looking for the break room. Her office door didn't have a lock and the sticky note she affixed to it asking for privacy had fallen off. To the chagrin of both, he walked in on her mid-pump, she said. All was forgiven, but around that time she decided two months of expressing milk at work would have to suffice.\n\"There was a little bit of a heartstring pull when it ended,\" said Mehaffey, whose daughter is now three. \"But for my health and my sanity I was fine with it. It was what needed to be done.\"\nIt's a common but discreet ritual for many new mothers who return to work after maternity leave: pumping and storing breast milk for their babies, a relatively inexpensive and healthful way to supply nourishment while separated.\nDespite the advantages for both mother and infant's health and the potential for employers to reap fewer absences in the long run, expressing milk on the job remains a sensitive subject for many working women. Pumping can keep new mothers connected to their children and help them maintain their milk supply so they can continue to breastfeed when they're at home, but it often comes at a cost.\nIn the best of circumstances, expressing milk at work can bring lactating women a new kind of camaraderie with their colleagues, not to mention management support as they carve out break times, find private accommodations and use sinks to clean equipment. But pumping also can be inconvenient, awkward and downright impossible at worst, depending on the job and the workplace, experts say.\nData on pumping at work is scant, but some women may be more likely to shy away from the time-consuming activity now for fear of appearing less productive and thus more expendable in a tough economy. Others may be more likely to pump to save money on formula.\n\"In this economic climate, I think people are going to be under a lot of pressure to look like a model employee,\" said Heather Boushey, senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington. \"You're seeing a lot more people who are going to be increasingly afraid of doing anything that's going to mark them as a less productive employee.\"\nMothers working low-wage jobs and jobs with high turnover are especially vulnerable to quitting breastfeeding early, experts agreed.\n\"Poorer women often have to come back to work much more quickly and are much less likely to have arrangements where they can hide out somewhere to express milk,\" said Ariane Hegewisch, study director for the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington.\nStill, not everyone sees the economy as a driving factor.\n\"It has nothing to do with a recession.

{"idx": "16705", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If ever a group set out to be teeth-grindingly annoying it is Gorillaz, Damon Albarn's 'other' band. In fact they're less a band than a virtual supergroup comprising four cartoons conceived by the Blur frontman and his one-time flatmate, illustrator Jamie Hewlett. Worse, they labour under names like Noodle and 2D and converse in character when they give interviews, most of which boast little else save knowing doggerel. You couldn't make it up - except, sadly, someone has.\nStill, all of it would be just about forgivable had their eponymous debut been magnificent. It was not. Its conceit - that a group of animated characters render our obsession with an artist's age and looks redundant - was marginally more interesting than the actual songs, which notwithstanding the spring-heeled, colourful 'Clint Eastwood' were demos with pretensions. Not so this new album.\nWhere its predecessor was the work of a core group of musicians, Demon Days is Damon with some help from umpteen friends. Of these the most notable is hip hop's Danger Mouse, the producer whose namesake is a Seventies cartoon and who shares Albarn's disregard for musical apartheid, as evidenced by his highly prized Beatles-based Grey Album.\nIt, however, pales beside the bulk of Demon Days, which juxtaposes hip hop's youthful brio and invention with an intimacy that evokes Blur's most recent album, Think Tank, and a funky, sad-eyed strain of electronica. Of course such eclecticism is nothing new, but here, in contrast to its skeletal precursor, the songs are fully realised and pregnant with ideas.\nTake the impossibly rich 'Dirty Harry', for instance. It is host to the San Fernandez Youth Chorus, rapper Booty Brown from LA crew the Pharcyde, Albarn's increasingly comely delivery and, naturally, some violins. It should be a mess. It rocks. Better still is the nimble liquid pop of 'DARE', on which Shaun Ryder manages to roll back the years, and the crazed 'Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head'.\nImprobably, the latter's star is Dennis Hopper, who narrates a psychedelic nursery rhyme for adults that suggests David Lynch, Prince and David Icke have put aside their differences and formed a supergroup. 'There was only fire, and then nothing,' thunders Hopper, serving to underline the album's central message: that mankind's clock is edging ever closer to midnight. A point reinforced, head-spinningly, on 'All Alone', wherein Tricky's ex Martina Topley-Bird supplements Roots Manuva's rap with ghostly sighs.\nFor all its preoccupation with mortality, however, Demon Days oozes life from first note to last. So impressive is it that you wonder why Albarn still feels the necessity to keep it surreal and hide behind the flimsy, time-worn concept of Gorillaz. This - rather than Think Tank, or Parklife - may prove to be the Blur man's masterwork."}

{"idx": "16711", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Fifty years ago, pianist Ahmad Jamal released an album that not only shattered jazz convention but, surprisingly, also made him a pop phenomenon.\nRecorded live on the South Side of Chicago, \"Ahmad Jamal at the Pershing\" announced a revolutionary way of playing the piano, even as its hit single -- \"Poinciana\" -- conquered jukeboxes from coast to coast (and beyond). Ever since, Jamal has remained an unrepentant jazz radical, his subversive ways of addressing the piano influencing generations of musicians.\nYet until Friday night, precious few listeners had heard the iconoclastic artist perform live in an orchestral setting. Could Jamal's sometimes soft-spoken pianism hold up against a roaring big band? Would his convulsive, stop-start brand of improvisation throw the orchestra into disarray? Might Jamal's distinctive voice -- with its fragmented phrases and constant shifts in tempo and texture -- be crushed in the process?\nA capacity audience packed Orchestral Hall to hear what would happen, and the results proved viscerally exciting, though a bit frustrating too. For if the 77-year-old Jamal's partnership with the Chicago Jazz Orchestra underscored the vitality of his work, the brevity of their time onstage together didn't allow the experiment to fully develop. Because the first half of the evening had been devoted to Jamal's trio, only the concert's brief conclusion featured the orchestral venture. If the idea was to leave the audience yearning for more, it worked. To hear Jamal dodge and parry with Jeff Lindberg's CJO was to appreciate anew the ingenuity of Jamal's stylistic breakthroughs. Here his art was cast on an epic scale, with screaming horns and thundering reeds punctuating his musical ideas. But it would take an evening's worth of this give-and-take to give Jamal's music adequate expression in an orchestral setting. Instead, listeners heard a few snippets -- each a window into his methods.\nThe evening's tour de force unfolded in a collection of three vignettes that, together, amounted to a kind of concerto for jazz trio and orchestra.\nIn the opener, Jamal's \"The Aftermath,\" the trio played an extended introduction that summed up Jamal's modus operandi: telegraphic phrases, sudden silences, jagged shards of melody, stunning shifts from loud to soft and back. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the orchestra leapt into the proceedings, unleashing volcanic eruptions and restless rhythms of its own.\nIn effect, Jamal's pianism had been transposed to orchestral dimension, and was all the more effective for it. When Jamal, the trio and the orchestra finally joined forces, the degree of rhythmic tension was almost unbearable.\nJamal's \"Should I?\" formed the middle movement of the de facto concerto, to mixed effect. If the strict three-quarter time format inhibited his ability to subvert tempo and meter, the piece still yielded refined musicmaking.\nThe finale, \"Devil's in My Den,\" illuminated Jamal's gifts as accompanist, a facet of his work typically overshadowed by the virtuosity of his solos. But when Jamal hammered chords or inserted riffs while CJO soloists brayed alongside him, there was no doubt who was driving this performance."}

{"idx": "16718", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The West Bank city of Ramallah is naming its streets to mark its 100th anniversary, but some of the choices are causing controversy as they honor people involved in planning terrorist acts.\n\u00adThis naming is part of a regeneration scheme started two years ago, but it is already being seen by some as a sign of growing extremism.\nBefore the scheme was launched, there were no street names, street signs or house numbers that could help people navigate around the city.\nThus Yasser Arafat gets a square. And a street is called after the neighbourhood Al-Nuzha that used to exist in Arab Jaffa in the 1930s. Another street called Al-Awdeh, meaning \u2018return\u2019, is a call for Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.\nThe criteria for choosing a name are simple: heroes, places, and ideas supported by the Palestinian people.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t differentiate between Hamas or Fatah,\u201d explains Janet Mikhail.\nIf anything, the opposite, as members of both organizations fighting for liberation are glorified. Which might surprise those who think the modern city of Ramallah would shy away from praising stalwarts of Hamas, an organization considered by many world powers as terrorist.\nOne of the thoroughfares is named after chief Hamas bomb maker \u2013 Yahya Ayyash, dubbed \u201cthe engineer\u201d. For three years he was Israel\u2019s most wanted man for masterminding suicide bombings that killed 90 Israelis, until he himself was killed.\nAs political analyst Khalil Shaheen explains, \u201canyone who was killed by the Israelis, even in a car accident, is considered a martyr\u201d.\nYahya Ayyash was killed by the Israeli internal security service after they tricked a friend of his into giving him a cell phone that was booby trapped. Fourteen years on his family is as proud as ever.\nSurprisingly, not all the streets names are Palestinian. One street is called after Rachel Corrie, an American activist who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer during a demonstration in Gaza in 2003. Rachel was part of the International Solidarity Movement, a group that, as Israelis charge, aids Hamas and other Palestinian extremist groups.\nThe decision to name a busy street in Ramallah after her was anonymous.\nSuch attention, even to extremist groups, may be explained by the growing desire among Palestinians to change the current course of events.\n\u201dPeople in the West Bank are fed up with the way they have been ruled during the past 15 years and they\u2019re eager to try something else,\u201d believes Khalil Shaheen.\nPolls show Hamas growing in popularity in the West Bank, while talks between rival Palestinian faction Fatah and Israel deadlock.\n\u201cHamas is changing, Hamas is trying to speak in the language the West understands,\u201d argues Shaheen.\nAnd as the new street signs go up in the city, it is becoming more and more clear that Hamas is also speaking in a language Ramallah Palestinians understand."}

We would buy clothing, or some type of G.I. Joe doll or a tank. The kids loved it. Especially my sister's son, he always tells people about his \"uncle in the Army.\"\nI'd like to say that this was strictly out of pride in the Army, but sometimes it was a contest between my husband and his brother to try to sway the kids over to their side. My brother-in-law served in the Navy for several years and quite often, the old Army/Navy rivalry caused this purchasing blitz. The kids were always being told Army was best or Navy was best. Once, we pulled in the driveway on a visit up north and the kids came running to the car chanting, \"Go Navy, Beat Army\" after some intense coaching from my brother-in-law, who stood in the doorway laughing. My husband promptly opened the trunk, grabbed the AAFES bag and pulled out the goods. The Army goods. That bag came out of the car before our dog did!\nMy husband still has the cot he was issued when he entered the Army. It has been to numerous field exercises (too many to count), NTC rotations and deployments. I'm totally convinced that 30 years from now, I'll still be able to smell the California desert and the woods of Ft. Hood on that cot.\nAs you've probably picked up on by now, we have a big family. When they come to visit, they usually come in large groups. Rarely have we had a large enough house to give everyone their own bed. That cot has been the bed for our oldest nephew on many occasions. When he was smaller, he loved sleeping on the Army cot. What boy wouldn't? In fact, even if a nice bed were available, there was a time when he would have chosen the cot over a bed because he was into the soldier stuff.\nThe little boy who used to love Army stuff is now all grown up and will be heading to college next year. Recently, he and his mother came to visit us while they were scouting colleges in the area. As many of you know, I'm currently living in a house that is half the size of my old house. What wouldn't fit in the living space is tucked away in the basement. Namely, guest beds and a sleeper sofa.\nI decided that my nephew's mother would take the guest room (no brainer) and my nephew could sleep on the sofa in the living room, but apparently my husband had other ideas.\nI'm sitting in the living room just before our nephew and his mother were to arrive and see my husband go down to the basement. Up he comes with a rather small bundle that looks -- and smells -- very familiar.\nWhat are you doing with that?\nIt's going to be Jason's bed. I'll set it up in the office, there's plenty of room there.\nIt'll be perfect. He loves this cot. You know that. He loves it.\nHe loved that cot. \"Loved\" not \"Loves.\"\nWha? Why wouldn't he be excited to sleep on the Army cot?\nI watched my husband process this. I think he got it. I know what he was thinking, he was looking forward to the next time our youngest nephew visits so he can pull the cot out and start the tradition all over again with another nephew.

The cost of the trips identified by POLITICO exceeds $300,000, according to a review of federal contracts and similar trip itineraries.\nPrice\u2019s use of private jets represents a sharp departure from his two immediate predecessors, Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Kathleen Sebelius, who flew commercially in the continental United States. HHS officials have said Price uses private jets only when commercial travel is not feasible.\nBut many of the flights are between large cities with frequent, low-cost airline traffic, such as a trip from Washington to Nashville that the secretary took on June 6 to make a morning event at a medication distributor and an afternoon speech. There are four regular nonstop flights that leave Washington-area airports between 6:59 a.m. and 8:50 a.m. and arrive in Nashville by 9:46 a.m. CT. Sample round-trip fares for those flights were as low as $202, when booked in advance on Orbitz.com. Price\u2019s charter, according to HHS\u2019 contract with Classic Air Charter, cost $17,760.\nNonetheless, POLITICO identified at least 17 charter flights that took place before the first storm \u2014 Hurricane Harvey \u2014 hit in late August, and included flights that did not appear to be for urgent HHS public health priorities.\nFor example, Price took a Learjet-60 from San Diego to the Aspen Ideas Festival \u2014 a glamorous conference at the Colorado resort town \u2014 that arrived at 3:33 p.m. on Saturday afternoon, June 24, nearly 19 hours before his scheduled panel. That flight likely cost more than $7,100, according to one charter jet agency estimate.\nSince being confirmed in early February, Price has developed a reputation inside the agency for flying on private charters rather than taking other means of transportation, people inside and outside the Trump administration said.\nAfter a POLITICO investigation identified five private flights that Price took up and down the East Coast last week, Price took a charter jet to Oklahoma on Tuesday of this week, Sept. 19, where he met with Native American tribes and toured health care facilities by car \u2014 although HHS initially explored flying him by charter around the state, two people with knowledge of Price\u2019s travels said. \u201cThere was a push from political [staff] at HHS to fly him and not drive him to these small communities,\u201d said one of the people.\nPrice\u2019s staff cut short his news conference in Oklahoma on Wednesday when reporters raised questions about his use of taxpayer funds, an attendee said.\nPrice\u2019s frequent trips around the country have rankled staff inside the White House, with a senior official saying many trips aren\u2019t related to priorities like Obamacare repeal and other items on the president\u2019s agenda. While Price has flown to Maine, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania since last Wednesday, President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have been frantically rallying support to pass an Obamacare repeal bill by Sept. 30."}

But what do you do when you find yourself looking at the same processes and the same information and can't improve your results? Try looking at things in a new way, graphically, using tools such as MindManager or TheBrain.\nA \u201cmind map\u201d organizes ideas, topics, tasks, random thoughts, solutions and relationships to other information in a new, graphical format. Early mind maps were done on paper or whiteboards. Now we have applications that take all the advantages of the paper and whiteboard mind maps and add a range of extra features, such as linking to documents and Web sites outside the map.\nBasic mind maps might look like a couple of outlines on either side of a central idea, but modern ones look like anything you want. However they look, they look new and interesting enough to kick start people into approaching problems from different angles.\nThe self-acknowledged leader in mind mapping software, MindJet, has expanded its flagship MindManager product to the Web for better collaboration. The company\u2019s MindManager8 desktop version sells for $349 for a perpetual license, and works with the Web standalone product available for $10 per user per month (usual volume discounts apply). The company added Mindjet Connect to take interactive mind mapping meetings down the same road WebEx took PowerPoint: multiple people can view the same map at the same time. Even better, mind maps are now as shareable and public as any online collaboration workspace.\nMindJet's CEO Scott Raskin says there are about 400 million knowledge workers worldwide today. Most are using Microsoft Office and \u201cpassively interacting\u201d with information. He believes every Outlook user is a prime candidate for MindManager8, either on the desktop or the Web. The only real difference between the two is the inability of the Web version to tightly integrate with desktop programs and work offline.\nI've been playing with MindJet Connect using Flash inside my browser, and it will make online brainstorming easier than ever. Add in some of the extra features and templates, like JVCGantt Pro 3 for project management, and you start to understand how some users have given up databases to keep all their information in mind maps of one kind or another.\nOne customer quote from CEO Raskin explains how a small business owner uses a MindManager8 map for every customer to better see at a glance what the customer has done for them, and what they can do for the customer in the future. Once you start coloring outside the lines with your thinking, thanks to visual information presentations, interesting things happen.\nThere are between 20 and 30 mind mapping software programs available.

{"idx": "16726", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Steven Soderbergh's great, despairing squall of a film, ''Traffic,'' may be the first Hollywood movie since Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' to infuse epic cinematic form with jittery new rhythms and a fresh, acid-washed palette.\nThe agitated pulse of the hand-held camerawork (by the director working under a pseudonym) that roughly elbows its way into the center of the action is perfectly suited to the film's hard-boiled subject, America's losing war on drugs. The color scheme sandwiches a few lush patches between sequences filmed in two hues -- an icy blue and a sun-baked yellow-orange -- that are as visually discordant as the forces doing battle.\nWhere Mr. Altman's masterpiece portrayed American culture as a jostling, twangy carnival of honky-tonk dreams, ''Traffic'' is a sprawling multicultural jazz symphony of clashing voices sounding variations of the same nagging discontent. The performances (in English and Spanish), by an ensemble from which not a false note issues, have the clarity and force of pithy instrumental solos insistently piercing through a dense cacophony.\nThe characters run the social gamut, from affluent United States government officials and wealthy drug lords on both sides of the United States border with Mexico and their fat-cat lawyers, to the foot soldiers doggedly toiling in a never-ending drug war.\nThe most indelible performances belong to Benicio Del Toro as a burly, eagle-eyed Mexican state policeman of pluck and resourcefulness who has the street smarts to wriggle out of almost any squeeze; Michael Douglas, as a conservative Ohio Supreme Court Justice who is appointed the country's new drug czar, and Erika Christensen, as his sullen drug-addicted teenage daughter. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also riveting as a wealthy, ruthless, Southern California matron who is unaware that her husband is a high-level drug smuggler until he is dragged out of their house by federal agents.\nThe movie, which jumps around from Tijuana to Cincinnati to Washington to San Diego, from a posh Ohio suburb to the inner city to the Mexican desert to the White House itself, offers a coolly scathing overview of the multibillion-dollar drug trade and the largely futile war being waged against it.\nBut as despairing as it is, ''Traffic'' is not cynical. It gives its isolated heroes in the trenches their due. One of these is Javier Rodriguez (Mr. Del Toro), a wily, good-hearted Mexican policeman who conspires with the Drug Enforcement Administration to bring down his own boss (Tomas Milian), a corrupt Mexican general who uses torture to get his way. Other heroes include a pair of D.E.A. undercover agents, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), who spend half their lives in cramped vans engaged in surveillance.\n''Traffic'' is an updated, Americanized version of a 1989 British television mini-series, ''Traffik,'' that followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. From an ambiguous, paranoically-charged opening desert sequence (reminiscent of the crop-dusting scene in ''North by Northwest''), in which Javier and his partner, Manolo (Jacob Vargas), surrender a newly captured truckload of coc"}

It will bring connectivity and for those wanting to spread Spotify to other speakers, this is a really simple and cheap solution.\nGoogle's Chromecast, launched in 2014, grasped home cinema by the lapels and shook it firmly. The convoluted path to a connected TV experience was firmly diverted into modern streaming ease and at a price that was almost rude.\nJump forward to the present day and there's a new kid on the block: Chromecast Audio. The new device from Google - which, as its name suggests, is all about streaming audio from your online services via Wi-Fi to otherwise offline speakers - looks to bring the simplicity we loved from Chromecast and breathe new life into those until-now disconnected speakers.\nChromecast Audio comes with a design that matches the second-generation TV Chromecast. It's round, measuring 51.9mm in diameter and 13.5mm thick. Yes, it's a black disc, meaning that the Chrome logo sits neatly in the centre, surrounded with vinyl-like grooves. It's a fun play on modern meet old skool.\nThere's a Micro-USB socket for power and a 3.5mm socket for your audio output. You'll need to either plug the supplied power pack into the wall, or connect the lead to a USB port somewhere.\nThere is a single button on Chromecast Audio that will power it off to restart, although if there's a problem you'll probably just pull out the cable instead. The provided 3.5mm cable is a bright yellow and measures 146mm long, making for a tidy connection to another speaker input without the need for excess cable lying around.\nChromecast Audio's raison d'\u00eatre is to deliver connectivity. It's the bridge between physical speakers and your music online, just as its TV cousin bridges the gap between TV and your services online.\nThe Audio's 3.5mm connection is how to hook-up to an existing speaker. That might be using the included cable, but it also supports an optical connection - although you'll have to supply your own cable for that. If you want to hook-up to an existing AV receiver or soundbar then the optical connector might be the more natural option.\nOn the wireless side Chromecast Audio offers 802.11ac (2.4/5GHz) Wi-Fi, which is a lot faster than some of the lesser Wi-Fi connection types. That ensures the best possible buffer for streaming when connecting to your router wirelessly.\nSetting up Chromecast Audio is very simple. All you have to do is plug the respective parts in and switch your existing audio device to the input you've plugged Chromecast into.\nThen, using the new and much-improved Chromecast app, you'll be guided through the setup process. This finds your Chromecast Audio and pairs it with your Wi-Fi network, taking a couple of minutes. That's it - then you're ready to stream new music to your old speakers (and more on service compatibility in a moment).\nThe app really isn't necessary needed beyond the setup process, because compatible devices and apps will automatically detect that you have a Chromecast Audio available on your network - so you can cast from the app you're in.\nHigh Dynamic Range is one app-based option that's automatically on when connecting via optical, to give the highest (or loudest) quality output when you link to Hi-Fi equipment."}

Current law allows them to return those ballots by mail, or hand-deliver them to election facilities at any time leading up to or on election day.\nSome voters like to wait until the last minute \u2013 228,000 mail-in ballots were dropped off at polling sites on the day of the 2018 general election, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\nSen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita said eliminating those so-called \u201clate-early\u201d ballots will help speed up the announcement of election results, and would temper frustrations from the 2018 election, when several races were too close to call for more than a week after election day.\nCounty officials testified that the Scottsdale Republican\u2019s logic is flawed.\nWhether they\u2019re mailed in or not, people like holding onto their ballots as long as possible, said Jennifer Marson, executive director of the Arizona Association of Counties, so ballots mailed at the last possible second would still pile up on election day, too.\n\u201cThe counties believe voters should have the opportunity to turn in that ballot regardless of when they received that ballot,\u201d Marson said.\nIf more voters use the alternative provided in Ugenti-Rita\u2019s proposal by voting in person on election day, in the event they forget to mail their ballots back on time, voters could experience longer lines at the polls and more costly elections, said Rivko Knox of the Arizona League of Women Voters.\nThat\u2019s really all beside the point, Knox said, because the bill is trying to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. While Republicans have complained that ballots took too long to count, recorders took roughly the same amount of time to count votes in 2014, 2012, and other elections, Knox said.\n\u201cThe difference was that several elections were very close,\u201d she said, meaning competitive races highlighted the vote-county process. Many of those close races resulted in victories for Democrats to key statewide offices, even after initial vote tallies on election night favored some Republican candidates.\nYavapai County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said there is one scenario in which Ugenti-Rita\u2019s bill would speed up the vote-counting process.\nUgenti-Rita later dismissed the criticisms of the county election officials as beyond their purview.\nThe committee\u2019s three Democrats criticized the bill for ignoring the expert advice of officials who conduct the elections.

This follows months of unprecedented demonstrations seeking his ouster. NPR's Eyder Peralta joins us now with the latest. Hi, Eyder.\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.\nSHAPIRO: First, just tell us what happened today.\nPERALTA: So for a few days, now thousands of protesters have been camping near President Omar al-Bashir's palace. They were calling for his ouster. And today, people woke up to military songs on state TV. Tanks started rolling across the streets of the capital Khartoum, and troops surrounded the presidential palace. And at that point, everyone sort of figured out what was happening, and they flooded the streets.\nIt was absolute elation. Thousands of people - young people, old people, kids - they poured out onto the streets. They sang. They chanted. They flashed the victory sign. And hours later, the country's defense minister came on state TV. He was wearing his military uniform. And he read a statement. This was a classic coup d'etat. President Omar al-Bashir had been arrested and thrown out of power by his own military.\nAnd it's really worth pausing on that, Ari, because Omar al-Bashir has been just one of the most ruthless tyrants on the African continent. In the '90s, the U.S. accused him of giving Osama bin Laden a place to hide. And at home, his security forces acted with just unrestrained violence. He tried to extinguish a rebellion in the south with a bloody war. And he was charged with war crimes, with genocide, for what his military did in Darfur.\nOmar al-Bashir has the distinction of being the only sitting president to have had a warrant out for his arrest from the International Criminal Court.

It also allowed guests to reflect on DSNI\u2019s part in revitalizing the Dudley community, which suffered from decades of neglect.\nOver the last 15 years, DSNI has helped to rebuild more than half of the Dudley neighborhood by creating homes, parks and businesses. When it formed in 1984, neglected lots where houses once stood comprised nearly one-third of the neighborhood. Desperate landlords set fires almost daily to collect insurance money on neighborhood homes and business.\nThe area became a dumping ground for garbage, which lowered property value and community morale. Because the government \u201cneglected\u201d the community, the downward spiral continued for several years, said DNSI Board Member Paul Bothwell.\nDSNI Executive Director John Barros stressed that the event would be a \u201chuge success\u201d if it allowed neighbors to reconnect with each other and build new relationships.

Trustee Bob Holmes, one of the honorees, said the foundation originally decided to support the establishment of DSNI after the Riley staff toured the neighborhood in 1983 when another community organization asked for money for a new carpet.

Platoons of workers are lugging Sheetrock and lumber, power tools whine and electrical coils hang every few feet. On a crisp June day, less than three months before the scheduled opening of this new Barneys on Sept. 8, the nine-floor store is still very much a work in progress. But as he climbs an unfinished staircase here, or ducks under a workman's ladder there, Pressman is familiar with every floor, every fixture, every piece of furniture that is on its hurried way.\nOn the first floor of the women's department, perfumes will be in the back instead of the front. \"I hate it when you get spritzed when you walk into a store,\" he says. Pressman likes aquariums, so there will be three big ones. He's a boxer, and the store's ninth-floor health club will have a ring. He's also a golfer, so maybe the putting green will come later.\nThe look of the store, at Madison Avenue and 61st Street, will be modern, open, spacious with large windows on every floor. Whites, grays and beiges will be the dominant colors, set off by forests of exposed wood -- 40 varieties, from beech to sycamore. Most of the furniture will be custom-made. Each selection, each judgment of taste, is personal. Gene Pressman, the 42-year-old eldest son, made many of the choices, but seven other members of the family -- parents Fred and Phyllis, brother Robert, sisters Liz and Nancy, wife Bonnie, and Robert's wife, Holly -- has his or her personal imprint. \"We're doing this like it's our home,\" Gene Pressman says. Some home. More like a $100 million shrine for a family of workaholics.\nThe Pressmans' Madison Avenue showcase, sheathed in French limestone, occupying much of a city block, is the largest new specialty store to be built in Manhattan since the Depression -- one of the most ambitious retailing ventures in the history of New York. Its arrival comes at a time when people are questioning the future of big stores, especially in New York, and when the weakened economy makes selling pricey, high-fashion merchandise a struggle. For the Pressmans, one of the last family dynasties in American retailing, the uptown store is their biggest bet since the business was founded in 1923, as a small men's shop at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.\nIs this a shrewd against-the-grain move, or an act of hubris?\nThe answer will not be known soon, probably not for a year or so after the Madison Avenue store opens, as the novelty of a major new shopping destination wears off. And its success will be measured largely by how much pain the Barneys Madison Avenue store inflicts on its main rivals in the uptown retailing hub -- Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's.\nFor years the Pressmans, from their downtown enclave, looked with envy at retailing's Gold Belt, the uptown Manhattan shopping district, roughly running from 50th Street into the 60's, and extending from Fifth Avenue east to Bloomingdale's on Lexington Avenue. \"We've had this underdog mentality, of not really being appreciated by the"}

Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, have now returned to their places of seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nThroughout the church's history, the faith's senior apostle has been selected by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to become the church's president. The second-most senior apostle is the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson, a retired world-renowned heart surgeon and a Mormon apostle for 32 years, is president of the Quorum of the Twelve and is expected to succeed President Monson as prophet-president of the church.\nPresident Monson set apart President Nelson as president of the Twelve in July 2015.\nThe new president of the church will be expected to name two apostles, filling the vacancies created by the deaths of President Monson and Elder Robert D. Hales, who passed away in October.\nElder Dallin H. Oaks, 85, is now the second-most senior apostle and is expected to be set apart as president of the Twelve.\nLDS apostles serve for life and are considered \"special witnesses\" of Jesus Christ to the world. Three apostles form the First Presidency. Twelve more make up the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nPresident Nelson also will be expected to name two new apostles, filling the vacancies created by the deaths of President Monson and Elder Robert D. Hales, who passed away in October.\nPresident Nelson joined the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 7, 1984.

She also interviewed 31 health professionals involved in infant care.\nShe found that mothers seemed to be confidently following guidelines they had gleaned themselves either through others, literature or the internet, and that many felt intuitively that it was the best way to feed their baby. The mothers believed the advantages of introducing solid food through BLW included healthier eating behaviours and that it was a \u201cless stressful\u201d way to introduce solid foods.\nTypically, the practice of BLW involves the infant picking up and feeding themselves pieces of soft fruit, vegetables and possibly meat, rather than the adult spoon-feeding them food that has been pur\u00e9ed or mashed. Ms Cameron says the practice is increasingly popular, and she had no difficulty in finding mothers practising this method of feeding in Dunedin.\nHowever, she found that among healthcare professionals with whom mothers would typically discuss feeding issues, there was scarce information about the practice. Some health professionals also had concerns about whether it might cause problems with choking or low nutrient intakes.\n\u201cBaby-led weaning appeared to be working for these women and babies, and they felt there were distinct advantages. Health professionals also felt the practice might have advantages, such as better eating patterns, but at the same time were hesitant to recommend it largely due to the fear that babies might choke on pieces of food,\u201d she says.\nWhile several mothers interviewed reported that their child had experienced a choking episode, none of these were serious incidents requiring intervention from parents, and it is not clear whether the infants were actually choking or gagging. Gagging is a common response when infants begin to eat any type of solid food.\n\u201cHowever, a number of foods that infants can pick up are definitely not suitable for them to eat. Most of the mothers in our study who reported a choking episode said it was due to raw apple.\n\u201cWe would strongly recommend that hard foods like raw apple not be offered as part of Baby-Led Weaning, or any other form of infant feeding,\u201d Ms Cameron says.\nThe University of Otago Departments of Human Nutrition and Medicine plan further research to study a modified form of BLW using a randomised controlled trial, and are currently recruiting 300 Dunedin mothers and babies for the study.\nCo-author on Ms Cameron\u2019s study, Dr Anne-Louise Heath, says this New Zealand research will address the scarcity of information worldwide on the best way to practice Baby-Led Weaning."}

The two nights' numbers were weighted equally with fan votes to determine the winner.\nFor Levi the final dance was a Salsa, leading judges to laud his star quality, while Jenkins did the Jive.\nDriver, wearing an oversized, sleeveless deep-pink shirt - which he doffed seconds into his final dance - and matching pants, turned out his spectacular Cha-cha-cha.\nIronically that was the same dance that gave the wide receiver his lowest score of the competition, a 21, earlier in the season. But he came on strong for the finals, with 30s for that as well as his Freestyle on Monday.\nThe competition had seemed like it was Jenkins' to lose, after she dominated many weeks throughout the 14th season, winning strong fan support and going into Tuesday's final dance with a perfect 60 from the judges.\nGoodman called her \"one of the most technically advanced dancers\" the show had ever seen, and \"the complete package.\"\n\"It's been an absolute dream,\" she said afterward, offering her congratulations to Driver and saying \"Well done Donald, we love you.\"\nAll 12 competitors from the season, all the way back to tennis star Martina Navratilova, who was the first eliminated, returned to dance on the live two-hour finale.\nOther dancers included soap star Jack Wagner, singer Gladys Knight, talk show host Sherri Shepherd, actress Melissa Gilbert and musician Gavin DeGraw, as well as Disney Channel star Roshon Fegen, actor Jaleel White and TV host and actress Maria Menounos.\nHighlights of the finale included musical performances by \"American Idol\" winner Kelly Clarkson, and Gladys Knight.\n\"Dancing With the Stars\" has been among the top-rated U.S. TV shows of this season and is ABC's most-watched program, drawing 18 million viewers on average this season.\nBut ratings for the seven-year-old program have slipped in recent seasons, and an All-Star edition featuring past contestant favorites has been ordered for fall."}
{"idx": "16755", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Recent \"hacks\" against Pentagon, Senate and FBI World Wide Web sites have highlighted the importance of protecting computer systems against cyberattacks. Indeed, the digital equivalent of spraying graffiti on agency home pages (and denying citizens access to those sites) is the least of the problems. Critical infrastructures central to our economy and government - including telecommunications, transportation, and banking and finance - depend on networked information systems that are vulnerable to attack.\nWhile there is no doubt that the problem of critical infrastructure protection is real, there is cause for concern that the hype surrounding the issue may lead to infringements on civil liberties. The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, which studied the issue in 1997, recommended the establishment of an \"early warning and response capability\" to protect telecommunications networks against cyberattacks, raising the specter of general monitoring of Internet traffic. Lately, it has been suggested that this software should be shared with the private sector, which would be encouraged to use it to monitor communications systems to detect attacks.\nThe commission also recommended the adoption of key-recovery encryption, a clear example of how the issue can serve as the vehicle for other agendas because key recovery not only has no value for infrastructure protection but would introduce a new set of vulnerabilities into computer networks. And recently we have seen legislative proposals to keep off the Internet information about the environmental dangers of chemical plants in the name of protecting those facilities against terrorist attacks.\nInstead of complaining about the openness of the Internet, the focus of government infrastructure protection efforts should be on building more robust systems in ways that do not erode civil liberties. Perhaps the government and businesses need to rethink their reliance on networked systems for internal operations. And designers of programs need to be sensitive to security implications.\n* First, the government should not impose security measures on private systems or compel sharing of information by the private sector. The owners of private-sector infrastructures are in the best position to understand and prioritize this range of threats and what is necessary to mitigate them.\nIt remains unclear what information flow from industry to the government would be beneficial to promote industry's protection of its own infrastructures.\n* Second, neither the government nor the private sector needs any greater authority to monitor communications or the Internet. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act already gives operators of private and government systems wide latitude in monitoring and intercepting communications on their own systems to protect their rights or property.\nPerhaps one of the most questionable elements of the government's evolving infrastructure protection program concerns the lead role assigned to the FBI as home of the National Infrastructure Protection Center. Much of the defined purpose of the center is \"protective.\" Yet the FBI is an investigative and counterintelligence agency with potent powers that do not mesh well with the voluntary cooperation of businesses on which the government claims the FBI will rely on to perform its infrastructure protection responsibilities. It would be better, on the grounds of effectiveness and civil liberties, to place elsewhere the infrastructure protection mission and the role of liaison with industry.\nWe must resist the logic that falsely promises an increase in security in return for a surrender of privacy and other civil liberties. In terms of the private sector, the government's role should be limited and largely advisory. Proposals for increased monitoring of information systems or for more intrusive background investigations of private-sector employees are not required and should be rejected.\n-- Schwartz is a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, Washington, D.C."}

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Kevin Colbert were impressed enough by the workout of the former undrafted free agent that they immediately signed him to a futures contract.\nWhen the Steelers started training camp a year ago, Will Johnson was behind fellow fullback David Johnson on the depth chart, and the two had quite a battle going on leading up to the first preseason game. As fate would have it, David Johnson tore up his knee early in that first preseason game and was lost for the season as a result. His injury opened the door for Will Johnson to become the starter, and he did just that.\nNow that he has a full season underneath his belt, Will Johnson told Wygal the areas that he worked on improving in during the offseason.\nShould tight end Heath Miller not be ready for the start of the season, the Steelers certainly will need as many receiving options on the field as they can get to help soften the blow of his absence until he is ready to play. Johnson moves well for a fullback and that more than likely is because he was originally a wide receiver when he first arrived at West Virginia.\nA few times last season we saw Will Johnson run the wheel route out of the backfield perfectly, and two of his 15 receptions were explosive plays that went for more than 20 yards each. I have a feeling that we will see a few more of those big plays in 2013 out of Will Johnson and he very well could wind up with 20 plus receptions which we haven\\\u2019t seen accomplished by a Steelers fullback since the days of John L.

He, being an unalloyed devotee of Sri Ram is revered by all Ram bhakts.\nIt is said in Srimad Bhagwatam (10.32.22) that the Lord is perpetually indebted to his devotees on account of their selfless service rendered by them to him. Even if he tries to repay them back, it would not be possible for him in the lifetime of one Brahma (some 311 trillion years).\nThis feeling of eternal gratitude marks one of the loving relationships between the Lord and his dear devotee. And when we talk of great devotees like Gopis of Vraja, Lord Shiva, Prahlad Maharaj, Bali Maharaj etc, the name of Sri Hanuman always comes to mind.\nSri Hanuman or Hanumanji or Bajrang Bali is a staunch devotee of Lord Sri Ramchandra, the incarnation of truth and virtue. He has been addressed by Sri Tulsidas as Ram Bhakta Shiromani, or the crest jewel of all the devotees of Sri Ram. He is addressed by various names like Pawan Putra, Anjaneya and Hanuman.\nTherefore, Hanuman Jayanti is the pious day on which Sri Hanuman descended on earth in order to serve the purpose of his eternal master, Lord Ram. And he, being an unalloyed devotee of Sri Ram is revered by all Ram bhaktas.\nAs per Uttara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the appearance of Sri Hanuman dates back to the beginning of Treta Yuga of the sixth Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu i.e. around 2.59 million years before.\nThere has been no specific recording of his birth date and it is a subject of discussion. As per the standard authorities and popularly followed traditions, people accept Chaitra Purnima to be his birth date. He appeared on Tuesday during the dawn hours.\nThere\u2019s a story narrated by Agastya Muni to Lord Ram in the Valmiki Ramayana, regarding Hanuman\u2019s birth. Sri Hanuman is one of the 11 expansions of Lord Shiva, who came in monkey form to serve Lord Ram in his mission to annihilate Ravana.\nOne day, the wife of Lord of monkeys, Vanaraja Kesari was standing on the top of a mountain. Her name was Mother Anjana, one of the celestial nymphs (Apsara Menaka) in her previous life. Since she had disturbed Vishwamitra Muni, the way a monkey does, she was cursed by him to be married to a monkey and give birth to monkeys in her next life.\nAfter her fervent prayers, he gave her a blessing that her son would be a portion of Lord Shiva and a great devotee of a particular form of Lord Vishnu. When she took birth as a human being, she was married to Vanaraj Kesari and was very charming and beautiful.\nVayu Deva, who was watching her from the heavenly kingdom became attracted to her and then, assuming a mystic form, mated with her and hence, Pawan Putra was born as ordained by the divine arrangements.\nBrihad Bhagwadamrita quotes a verse from Hayashirsha Pancharatra.\nThe sacred day"}

Luckily, Galavant is doing a great job casting its spell so far. According to ABC News, the musical comedy has used its magic to conjure up an appearance by John Stamos. He\u2019s set to guest star as a singing knight who will be a rival to the series\u2019 titular character.\nAccording to Broadway World, Stamos\u2019 rival will be played by the equally-dashing Josha Sasse. Sasse\u2019s hero character, Galavant, is a love-struck charmer who loses his ladylove Madalena (Mallory Jansen) when she\u2019s kidnapped by the evil King Richard (Timothy Omundson). After watching Omundson\u2019s antics in the trailer, it\u2019s clear that John Stamos won\u2019t play the only charming villain on the show.\nThis plot might sound somewhat similar to that of The Princess Bride, but rest assured that Galavant is no cheap knock off, and the hero\u2019s damsel in distress is no Princess Buttercup \u2014 she decides to ditch Galavant for a regal life of fortune and fame. Galavant seemingly gives up on the whole hero thing after losing his love, but a princess (Karen David) who needs help saving her kingdom just might help him get back into the groove of slaying dragons and saving the day.\nJudging from the Galavant trailer, John Stamos made a smart move by joining the ABC series. It features some delightfully Monty Python-esque moments, including Omundson gleefully singing about eye-stabbing and liberating heads from necks. John also should have no problem fitting in with the talented cast \u2014 he\u2019s done plenty of singing over the course of his career, and he\u2019s even starred in a TV musical series. John Stamos\u2019 stint as a singing dentist on Glee probably helped him score the Galavant role.\nAs The Inquisitr previously reported, ABC\u2019s other fairy tale series, Once Upon a Time, is getting tons of buzz for adding characters from Disney\u2019s Frozen to its cast. Galavant might not feature Disney characters, but it does have a few Disney connections \u2014 EP Dan Fogelman wrote the Tangled screenplay, and the series features songs by composer Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin) and lyricist Glenn Slater (Tangled, The Little Mermaid).\nAre you looking forward to seeing John Stamos as a knight in shining armor on Galavant?"}

Currently in private beta, it's a bookmarking tool, similar to Twine, that aggregates information around various News Groups that cover any topic under the sun. socialImedian has sent over a few thousand invites for Mashable readers. Click here to register for an account, and type in \"Mashable\" for the beta invite code.\nWhen you first start out, you can easily search for News Groups to join up with, or create one of your own. To make things easier, as with all good social bookmarking tools, social(median has a browser plugin for easy clipping as you surf the web.\nThe bookmarking tool is pretty basic: title, URL, and description. There's not even an option for designating which News Group you'd like to add a particular item to while bookmarking URLs. socialImedian is still very much in its beginning stages, however, so new features are sure to come about as the team continues to build out its feature set, and work from user feedback.\nWhat I do like about socialImedian is its ability to enable clipping from other users' sources, directly from the socialImedian site. While the continuous search and discovery tools aren't completely circular within the network, this particular feature helps users better explore and utilize the site's user-collected data. Once you've interacted with the site on these levels, socialImedian will then deliver custom news to you. For every News Group, you can indicate what delivery schedule you'd like.\nThe concept is of course not new by any stretch of the imagination, and I think that the space is more than ready for an open approach for importing and sharing bookmarks across such networks. Beyond this, I think that with so much development going on in the mobile sphere, the space is also ready for better abilities to \"bookmark\" the non-digital life for digital purposes, and leveraging that for social purposes as well. Evernote is doing some exploration towards this end, but I'm pretty interested in seeing how such bookmarkin tools can be further utilized for personal purposes."}

Challenging the AAP to face the electorate after 20 of its MLAs were disqualified recently, former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has asserted that the Congress would make gains if bypolls took place. She further claimed that there is an \u2018absence of credibility\u2019 with the Kejriwal government. Stating that the AAP was trying to avoid elections, she told PTI that, had the party been confident of winning bypolls it would not have challenged the disqualification of its 20 MLAs. Dikshit, Delhi\u2019s longest-serving chief minister also accused the Kejriwal led party of not delivering on its promises.\nSupporting the disqualification of 20 of its MLAs in the Office of Profit case, Dikshit alleged that if the party thinks it can break rules and get away with it, then it is living under a \u2018fallacy\u2019.

Whatever was allowed, within the post, that was given, nothing more than that,\u201d she said. Dikshit maintained that if the Congress goes to polls with a coordinated strategy, it has a \u201cvery good chance\u201d to win some of the seats.\nNotably, Sheila Dikshit did not campaign for the Congress in the last Assembly polls, in which the party did not open its account in any of the 70 constituencies in the state."}

The information and records of breast cancer survivors gathered in the registry will be used in a study to determine whether early diagnosis of lymphedema can help treat and, possibly, prevent it.\n\u201cThere is early evidence to suggest that prompt diagnosis may reduce the severity or eliminate this problem,\u201d said Stanley Rockson, MD, the Allan and Tina Neill Professor of Lymphatic Research and Medicine, the lead investigator of the study. \u201cIf you take a wait-and-see treatment approach, by the time the lymphedema becomes noticeable, it can be quite advanced. Caught earlier, it may be more manageable, or even reversible.\nA leading expert in lymphatic diseases, Rockson, who directs the Center for Lymphatic and Venous Disorders at Stanford, helped establish the first patient registry and tissue bank for patients with lymphatic disorders in 2009.\nFor this new study, Stanford researchers hope to recruit an estimated 1,000 breast-cancer survivors for the Stanford National Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry.\nParticipants will periodically update information about any symptoms, test results or treatments in 15-minute online sessions. They\u2019ll give approval for their surgeons to provide their treatment information to the registry. Identifying information will be removed.\nCurrently, there is no cure for lymphedema, a disorder that arises in 15-60 percent of breast cancer survivors. A lifelong problem of disrupted lymph circulation characterized by fatigue, limb swelling and loss of the integrity of the skin, the condition\u2019s severity can range from mild discomfort to disabling disfigurement, pain and loss of function.\nWhen lymph circulation is delayed or interrupted, swelling and inflammation can result from a traffic jam of lymph that builds up in the limbs. There are multiple sources of blockages but often they are caused by tumor removal surgery, radiation treatment or lymph node biopsy. The only available treatments are physical therapies, including skin massage, drainage and pressure bandages, though the long-term effectiveness of these therapies has not been carefully studied.\nPatients interested in enrolling can log into the Stanford National Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry website at: http://breastcancer-lymphedema.stanford.edu.

After August's long lull, the eurocrisis roared back into life today with the European Central Bank's new bond-buying programme, a warning from the OECD, depressing jobless data from France and Greece, and policemen clashing with other policemen in Athens.\n\u2022 The European Central Bank has released details of its much-anticipated plan to ease the debt crisis in Europe. After raising expectations in recent weeks, Mario Draghi met them this afternoon: when he announced that the ECB would create a strong, credible backstop to protect the eurozone's weaker members from unjustifiably high borrowing costs.\nThe plan, called the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme, sees the ECB commit to buying unlimited quantities of debt of up to three years in maturity. To qualify, a country would have to accept conditions \u2013 ie, promise to make certain economic reforms.\nAnalysts aren't sure that conditionality can be implemented. And the Bundesbank flatly opposes the idea.\n\u2022 The initial reaction to the OMT was favourable, with shares rallying across Europe and on Wall Street. Spain's IBEX closed almost 5% higher, while the FTSE gained more than 2%. Traders urged caution, but the mood in the City was relief, for now.\n\u2022 Euro diplomacy continued, with Angela Merkel and Mariano Rajoy meeting. The two leaders put on a united front, but Merkel insisted that Europe couldn't relax its push for fiscal reform.\n\u2022 The OECD warned that the eurozone crisis remained a major threat to the global econony. It slashed its forecasts for economic growth, predicting deeper contractions in the UK, Spain and Italy.\n\u2022 Europe's jobless crisis ground on. France's unemployment rate hit a 13-year high, while in Greece nearly one in four are out of work.\n\u2022 Opposition to Greece's austerity cutbacks was also evident. Around 50 police officers, angry about planned pay cuts, protested outside a riot police school this morning.\nThanks for reading and commenting (as ever).

On BBC 2 from 10.30pm BST I reckon.\nSome quotes from Mario Monti just hit the wires.\nItaly's prime minister says he welcomes the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme announced by the ECB today, calling it a step towards \"more satisfactory governance\" of the eurozone.\nHe also says that it's \"too early to say\" if the ECB's insistence on conditionality might deter Italy from seeking help.\nThere were also reports today that Monti had called for a code of conduct to prevent European politicians and policymakers bad-mouthing each other. Never got to the bottom of it, but it sounds like a fine plan.\nBefore we get carried away with the euphoria, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about what was announced today.\nAs mentioned earlier, the conditionality element is key \u2013 Draghi says countries who receive help through the Outright Monetary Transactions plan will be tied to making economic reforms.

{"idx": "16781", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A volatile 2012 is expected with pockets of great innovation, opportunity and new successes, as well as challenges.\nSomebody doesn't have to be an advanced planner to see the possibilities, on the consumer and business sides, of augmented reality (AR). The good news: AR already is here.\nAs the name implies, AR focuses on superimposing information on a still or moving image. The possibilities are virtually limitless. Think of the impact on consumers and retailers if a shopper can focus on a car, a can of peas or a widescreen television and see the price of the same item at dealerships, groceries or electronics outlets in a 10-mile radius of where he or she is shopping. Think of an executive walking down the street while viewing the PowerPoint of a conference call in which he is participating.\nSeveral people who have seen the glasses, but who are not allowed to speak publicly about them, said that the location information was a major feature of the glasses. Through the built-in camera on the glasses, Google will be able to stream images to its rack computers and return augmented reality information to the person wearing them. For instance, a person looking at a landmark could see detailed historical information and comments about it left by friends. If facial recognition software becomes accurate enough, the glasses could remind a wearer of when and how he met the vaguely familiar person standing in front of him at a party. They might also be used for virtual reality games that use the real world as the playground.\nGoogle may be the most influential company planning to implement AR, but it is far from the only one. Existing projects generally involve data superimposed on a smartphone screen. This tibbr video offers some examples of AR, and hints at the expansive potential of the category.\nVergence Labs is working the goggle idea as well. This PCmag story is accompanied by a couple of videos. There are a couple of approaches mentioned. One is a third-person camera, in which images from another device are routed to the person wearing the headset. Another approach focuses on data around the edges of a frame. The piece says that the ability to discover the name of person the user is looking at through a link to Facebook - providing the subject being viewed is a member - is possible. It also is fraught with privacy concerns. The takeaway isn't whether this is permissible, however; it's that it is possible and seemingly not too far off.\nJohn Parkinson, the head of the Global Program Management Office at AXIS Capital, sees the possibilities. He offers some examples and some salient questions. The issues deal with storage of the massive amount of data that is generated, reconciling all that data, audit trails and security. The interesting thing is that Parkinson writes as if he has spent a lot of time considering the value and challenges of this technology. He, at least, is way past the \"wow\" phase and into how the technology can be applied.\nIt's not all about goggles, however. A GPS image of a map with exits and street names on the image is a form of AR. Indeed, perhaps the most compelling thing about AR is that, as glitzy as it is, it is a natural and seamless extension of things that have long been a part of the telecommunications landscape. It is as potentially useful and as it is glitzy."}

{"idx": "16783", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Jon Lester had gone eight straight starts without a loss, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Red Sox left-hander was exactly racking up a ton of Cy Young votes.\nQuite the contrary, as demonstrated by his Monday night performance, a 7-3 loss to the visiting Chicago White Sox. Lester needed 127 pitches, three off his career high of 130 during his 2008 no-hitter against Kansas City, to go 52/3 innings and was ultimately done in by a two-run bloop double by Alexi Ramirez. In reality, he was done in by his own ineffectiveness.\nLester had only one decent pitch all night, a kiss of death in the major leagues, but it also signals a somewhat troubling trend. His cutter, a variation of the fastball that features late movement, was working just fine, but nothing else was. The problem is that it\u2019s become a commonplace occurrence.\nWhat\u2019s troubling to the Sox is that Lester appeared to have corrected an uncharacteristic tailspin with a three-hit shutout at Cleveland on May 25 (when he threw 40 cutters and 37 four-seamers), but he lasted only six innings. His game longevity was a serious problem in three prior games, as well. At Toronto and New York, and in a Fenway game against the Cubs, he gave up 24 hits and 14 earned runs in 17.1 innings. That included four home runs, a .329 batting average against and a .385 BABIP (batted balls in play) average. His ERA was 7.27. His May ERA is 5.50, dropping him to 7-2, 3.94.\nYet, Lester didn\u2019t think there was any correlation between this game and that three-game stretch. \u201cNo, completely different. Those games kind of got away from me. Threw dumb pitches and not the right time. Tonight I just really didn\u2019t have a feel for anything. I stunk. There\u2019s no other way to put it.\nSo Lester\u2019s pitch count continued to climb; he also gave up eight hits while striking out only four, snapping a stretch of 10 straight games with at least five.\nNow, just like during his three-game bad stretch, Lester goes back to work. Because John Lackey is likely to return and throw next Sunday, and with days off Thursday and Monday, Lester won\u2019t pitch again until next Tuesday in New York. \u201cBack to the drawing board a little bit and he\u2019ll have a good side with Curt (pitching coach Young),\u201d said Francona.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel,\u201d Lester said. \u201cI need to go out there and try and figure things out. I think it\u2019s just one of those deals tonight I got a little ahead of myself at times, working East to West instead of North to South. Threw the ball up in the zone. So, no, I don\u2019t need to throw an extended bullpen or anything like that. Yes, it\u2019ll be nice to get an extra day.

They were released from jail the day after they were arrested.\nThey've pleaded guilty and were ordered last week to pay a joint restitution amount of $3,241.01 to the city of Des Moines, in addition to other court fees, records show.\nThe money will pay for the work of several police officers, firefighters and city street maintenance workers who were called to the protest, which blocked McKinley Avenue for more than two hours.\nCourt records show a breakdown of the city's costs in responding to the protest: $1,222.18 for police labor costs, $1,141.56 for firefighter labor costs, $47.32 for city-owned vehicle response and $829.95 for street maintenance.\nA larger group of people participated in the protest, but only Montoya, Horne, Reznicek and Kaaz refused to leave when police asked them to stop blocking the road. All four of them sat in the road with their arms in concrete barriers that they had set up. The fire department had to cut the concrete barriers to clear the road.\nPolice and fire officials on scene that morning described the protest as peaceful. Several of the protesters repeatedly said that they are nonviolent and promote peace.\nThe group of about 20 protesters was organized by Frank Cordaro, a former Catholic priest affiliated with the Catholic Worker House, who said he wants the Air Guard base to stop flying military drones, which he believes are killing innocent people overseas.\nThe protesters held signs that included the phrases \"End war\" and \"End drone warfare.\"\nCordaro was not arrested that day, but he had previously been arrested outside the air base for trespassing. He and others had protested there regularly since May.\nThe 132nd Wing of the Iowa Air National Guard started using remotely piloted aircraft in October 2013, a switch from piloting F-16 aircraft, Iowa National Guard spokesman Col. Greg Hapgood said in a statement after the protest. The unit remotely operates MQ-9 Reaper aircraft overseas from the Des Moines air base, Hapgood said, adding that \"the vast majority\" of flight missions are focused on gathering intelligence and imagery about enemies.\nGuard members \"serve proudly to uphold the free expression rights\" of protesters, Hapgood said, but he added that contacting U.S. senators and representatives would be more effective than protesting locally.\n\"Protesting here does nothing to effect change with respect to the national defense missions,\" Hapgood said.\nThe protesting has continued on a smaller scale compared with the June 28 road-blocking and arrests. Court records show Horne was arrested again outside the air base on July 1. He was cited for trespassing."}

Those were thrilling experiences, but in Concannon\u2019s opinion, finding and recovering the F-1 engines is on an entirely different level.\nThat\u2019s not just his opinion.\nSome of the components on display in Seattle came from F-1 engines that were fired up for Apollo 12 in 1969, just months after the history-making Apollo 11 moon landing that same year. Other components came from the engines for Apollo 16, the second-last moon mission, which was launched in 1972.\nThe F-1 engines weren\u2019t meant to survive their missions. The Saturn V\u2019s first stage dropped away less than three minutes after launch while the crew continued onward to orbit. The booster for each mission smashed into the ocean and broke apart, leaving the remains of its five engines to drift three miles down to the bottom of the sea.\nBezos was 5 years old when Apollo 11 happened. Decades later, he said the Apollo experience \u201cwas a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering and exploration,\u201d eventually leading him to create Amazon as well as his Blue Origin space venture.\nSeven years ago, the billionaire asked Concannon to come up with a plan for recovering the Apollo engines. At the time, Bezos said his objective was not just to reawaken memories for the Apollo generation, but also to inspire future generations of 5-year-olds.\n\u201cTo me, that is the purest form of giving,\u201d Concannon said.\nConcannon recruited the members of the expedition team, drawing heavily on veterans from Seattle, and worked out the details for the recovery effort. When camera-equipped submersible robots identified and dredged up the engines in 2013, Bezos said the underwater scene reminded him of a \u201cmagic sculpture garden,\u201d with some parts twisted almost beyond recognition.\nThe recovered artifacts went through a round of preservation at the Kansas Cosmosphere \u2013 and then were shipped to the Museum of Flight, where they were put in storage while experts worked out how best to display them. This week marks the official coming-out party for the F-1 engines and the \u201cApollo\u201d exhibition.\nThe engine components are arranged like puzzle pieces to show how they fit together in flight. The intact engine stands alongside the artifacts to serve as a visual guide, revealing the intricacies of 1960s-era aerospace engineering as well as the violence done by the fall into the sea.\nDoug King, the Museum of Flight\u2019s president and CEO, marveled at the 1.5 million pounds of thrust that the F-1 engine bl"}
{"idx": "16787", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I marched a hole in my shoes the first time.\nIt was 2006. His name was Martin Lee Anderson and he was 14 and had been sent to boot camp in Panama City, Fla. He had stolen his grandmother\u2019s car. She sent him to be redirected. Instead, he was killed. Seven guards. One nurse. Eight acquittals.\nSo we marched from the campus to the Florida Capitol. As a member of the FAMU chapter of the NAACP, I held the banner. I would march many more times\u2014for many different reasons\u2014but there was nothing like that first time. So for me, the FAMU experience is synonymous with activism.\nIn 1887, segregation was the law of the land, and the second Morrill Act said that if Florida were to have its white and male University of Florida, then it had to also approve a school for Negroes. Reluctantly, it did, and the State Normal School for Colored Students was reorganized as a college for black students, both male and female, which makes our university the first coeducational institution of higher learning in Florida: iconic activism.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain why we Rattlers love FAMU so much. It\u2019s a visceral, almost-irrational devotion. I guess we take the alma mater\u2014our national anthem\u2014which says, \u201cI\u2019ll fight and win whatever the battle be\u201d as a challenge to \u201crumble, young Rattler. Rumble.\u201d With anybody. Anywhere. Over anything. At any time. Who run it? Those hard-charging Rattlers of old A&M.\nSo, what, then, is the relationship between activism and homecoming? It\u2019s this: FAMU is a testament to the strength of the African-American will and mind. It is the tangible representation of our power. We took the discarded rock and made of ourselves a cornerstone.\nFrom the oasis in the center of Tallahassee, Fla., we learned how to first cultivate knowledge of self, heritage, legacy and history and then to apply that knowledge, build on that knowledge and share that knowledge. We learned what it means to be black, beautiful, magical and powerful. We learned how to do the work. Then to test our theories, we went out into the world\u2014the world outside of our oasis\u2014to see how our brilliance held up. We took fellowships and internships, assistantships and research grants, contracts and signing bonuses. We left our microcosmic world to show the macrocosmic world what we would do.\nBut it was never for them; it was activism. For us. By us. Some of us then decided to claim a seat at the table. Some of us decided to build our own table. Some of us decided to set the table ablaze and have a seat on the floor. And we always knew for whom we were fighting: It was for us.\nSo wherever it is in the world that we find ourselves, we still manage to make it home\u2014to homecoming\u2014like a secular communion. \u201cAs often as we eat this bread (a powdery funnel cake) and drink this cup (a plastic tub of vendor lemonade), we do show our reverence, our fellowship, our relationship.\nWe return to the place of our radicalization to renew our commitment to us. We find the courage to withstand the insult of the world by having a drink with a brother, a meal with a sister, a talk with a mentor. It is our necessary thing, for the struggle ever continues.\nDr. Rondrea"}

{"idx": "16792", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement officers in New York on Friday announced that they had filed criminal charges against the leaders of a pyramid scheme that sold \"fraudulent cryptocurrency\" to unsuspecting investors.\nAuthorities from the Southern District of New York and the New York District Attorney, the investigative arm of the IRS and the FBI said that OneCoin founders Konstantin Ignatov and his older sister Ruja Ignatova stole billions of dollars from consumers through \"a multi-level marketing network\" they launched in 2014.\nThe 33-year-old Ignatov, who was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on March 6, faces a wire fraud conspiracy charge. The 38-year-old Ignatova, who has been at large since disappearing from public view in October 2017, faces wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year sentence.\n\"As alleged, these defendants created a multibillion-dollar 'cryptocurrency' company based completely on lies and deceit,\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. \"They promised big returns and minimal risk, but, as alleged, this business was a pyramid scheme based on smoke and mirrors more than zeroes and ones. Investors were victimized while the defendants got rich.\"\nCryptocurrency has been slowly making its way into the mainstream, but has also been dogged by concerns about its misuse and vulnerability. Yet Rafael Yakobi, a partner at The Crypto Lawyers, a San Diego-based law firm, said that while he was \"impressed by the size of the conspiracy,\" the indictment was an isolated event that wasn't representative of legitimate coin offerings or the wider crypto industry.\n\"Legitimately decentralized cryptocurrencies are not susceptible to these types of schemes because if sufficiently decentralized, no individual can collect the money and run away with it,\" Yakobi said.\nHe added that investors should treat cryptocurrency with the same care as other investments. \"Investors have to be responsible for their decisions,\" Yakobi said.\nAccording to the indictment, OneCoin members recruited others to purchase cryptocurrency packages. The structure enabled OneCoin to develop a huge network that may have totaled more than three million members.\nBulgaria-based OneCoin claimed that it mined cryptocurrency using servers that the company operated and that the value of OneCoin was based on market supply and demand. OneCoin was worth less than a dollar, but as of January 2019, OneCoin had a value of over $30. But investigators said that OneCoin itself determined the value of a token and that it did no cryptocurrency mining.\nCryptocurrency mining is a process by which individuals use special software to solve math problems and record cryptocurrency transactions on a virtual ledger. These so-called cryptocurrency miners earn tokens for their efforts.\nInvestigators say that Ignatova created OneCoin, which continues to operate, to defraud investors.\nInvestigators found that between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2016 alone, OneCoin Ltd. generated approximately $4 billion in sales revenue and earned \"profits\" of over $2.5 billion.\n\"This is an old scam with a virtual twist,\" IRS Special Agent in Charge John R.

I don't know if it's good or bad, but it tells us the market is risk-on,\" he said.\nWall Street's warm reception can only come as welcome reassurance for Box, whose IPO journey has been a rocky one. After originally filing to go public last March, the company ended up postponing those plans, citing unfavorable market conditions.\nNow, however, not only does it look like Box has turned the corner in that respect, but the timing may have been better in other ways. Perhaps most notably, \"there haven't been a slew of tech IPOs recently,\" Sarracino noted.\n\"People have had time to do the research,\" he said. \"I also think there aren't a lot of places to go from a macro perspective in 2015. This could be a really strong year for equities.\"\nBox's technology, meanwhile, is clearly a factor in its Wall Street success. \"When it started, what it did was revolutionary in the enterprise market,\" Sarracino said.\nLooking ahead, though, there's no doubt Box will have to move quickly. Storage is a commodity business, Sarracino noted, and Box will have to make sure customers see it as a provider of more than just storage.\n\"It will be important to continue to provide vertical apps on top of infrastructure,\" he said. \"They already have some stuff, like basic apps for small businesses and a software development kit that developers can build on, but they need to do more.\"\nIt will need to create apps for functions such as collaboration and messaging, for instance, and they'll need to be tailored for specific industries. \"They'll probably start horizontal, but they'll need to go vertical,\" Sarracino said.\n\"It's hard to get developers' attention right now, so they'll probably have to build a bunch of it on their own,\" he said.

It\u2019s an issue that the City Council\u2019s Committee on the Justice System reviewed at an October 2018 hearing, where public defenders and prosecutors sat at the same table to discuss the need for higher pay.\nLegal Aid said Tuesday that it reviewed employment data from its own criminal defense practice and found that, among attorneys hired between 2007 and 2017, the rate of retention decreases as attorneys gain more experience. A large percentage of attorneys leave the office between their fifth and tenth years, Legal Aid reported. Nearly half of attorneys hired in 2007 had left the office by their tenth year, according to Legal Aid.\nA review of New York City public defender salaries posted on the website Glassdoor.com demonstrates the relatively low pay. The average base pay for a Legal Aid staff attorney is $68,223 per year, based on a review of 52 salaries.\nBrooklyn Defender Services pays staff attorneys an average base salary of $65,619 based on four listed salaries. The Bronx Defenders pay an average base salary of $67,000 per year based on seven listed salaries.\nAn AccessLex/Gallup survey from January 2018 found that 60 percent of law school graduates borrowed more than $100,000 in loans for law school between 2010 and 2017. The survey was reported by Quartz.\nTina Luongo, the attorney in charge of Legal Aid\u2019s Criminal Practice, highlighted specific salary disparities between Corporation Counsel attorneys and public defenders during the October hearing.\nNew York City Corporation Counsel attorneys with 10 years of experience earn an annual salary of roughly $108,000 while public defenders with 10 years of experience earn about $90,000, she said.\nPay disparities also affect prosecutors, who earn less than than their corporation counsel counterparts as well.\n\u201cTo ensure justice and fairness without fear or favor, prosecutors and indigent defense agencies must be able to recruit and retain the brightest legal minds,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman-Agnifilo in written testimony presented to the committee in October. \u201cA low starting salary combined with the twin burdens of tremendous law school debt and the cost of living in New York City make it extremely challenging for our offices to recruit recent law school graduates in the competitive legal labor market. In a statement, the Legal Aid Society said public defender salaries pale in comparison to other attorneys and discourage many attorneys from pursuing or maintaining their careers in public service."}

Universities abroad do not follow the same admission criteria as Indian Universities do and hence every student applying stands and equal chance even if they may not have equal scores.\nNew Delhi: Are you planning to study abroad but have no idea where to start? Well we will break down the essential steps for you. Applying to a foreign university can be a different and fun experience. Universities abroad do not follow the same admission criteria as Indian Universities do and hence every student applying stands and equal chance even if they may not have equal scores. While the application process may vary a little among countries and universities, it would include some basic steps. In the following article we will explain all the essential and major steps involved in applying to a foreign university.\nThe first step in applying abroad is identifying which country you would wish to study in. Then you would need to figure out which course you wish to study and what all institutes in the said country offer that course or a variation of that course. Shortlist the institutes where you might want to study. Stay updated about the admission cycle of the University. Our suggestion is drop a mail to the International Students helpdesk of the University of your choice. Generally they revert back with admission schedule and necessary guidance about the process.\nYou would need the application forms to apply. You can either request for the application form through email or apply online if the facility is available. While applying online make sure that you are filling up the application form meant for international students.\nCheck entry requirements for the university of your choice. Also check what for English Language Proficiency Tests accepted by the university. Ususally the universities require IELTS, TOEFL score for admission to majority of courses. For admission to management programs GMAT score may be required. GRE or SAT are also popular requirements.\nSchedule your test and make sure to get scores which are required for admission to the university of your choice.\nAlmost every foreign university requires its applicants to write one or more essay as part of the application process. The essay is supposed to help universities evaluate a prospective student's personality and assess if they fit in with the culture and objectives of a university. Many universities ask students to write essay on a specific topic. Universities may also ask you to submit a statement of purpose.\nMost Universities also require students to submit one or more letters of recommendation. The letters of recommendation should be issued by someone who has either taught you or you have worked for.\nOnce you have written the essay and arranged the Letter of Recommendation you need to submit the completed application form to the university in question. Some university may ask you to send the application form via email, others may ask you to fill application form and upload necessary documents online.\nThis is an important step. A university will not consider your application if you fail to send your test scores. Every test taking agency has provision to send your test scores to university of your choice."}

But the latest edition of its staff newspaper reveals the fleet will again be united under one banner.\nThe change of heart follows the policy of four years ago when, under the leadership of Robert Ayling, a third of the fleet was painted in a range of abstract designs from around the world.

Research commissioned by the company showed that British passengers still wanted to 'fly the flag'. So too, BA now admits, do foreign customers.\nThe airline has taken the decision to paint the 'Chatham Union Jack' as its emblem on all aircraft.

{"idx": "16820", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, \"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (Romans 6:23). This single sentence neatly summarizes the Christian doctrine of atonement, which teaches that the reconciliation of sinful humanity with the God of love was accomplished by God in the sacrifice of His son, Jesus Christ, on the cross.\nChristianity teaches that God hates sin and will punish the transgressor. It is in the nature of humans to sin, so all people risk separation from God, the source of all life and love. Cut off from God, we suffer anxiety and despair in an insignificant and unhappy life. We become hateful toward others and ourselves, inflicting pain on each other and on the rest of creation.\nChristians also believe that human existence does not end at physical death. There is a world to come, and the consequences of sin will follow humans there. As the judge of all, God will assess each individual's relationship to Christ; people risk a sentence of eternal punishment and spiritual death, forever separated from God. A great deal of Christian art and writing has vividly depicted the grotesque torture and suffering of those damned to hell.\nAs a consequence, salvation is the foremost concern for Christians. It is fallen human nature to sin, yet God punishes sin. Humans are, at least according to some Christian doctrine, therefore helpless, vulnerable to punishment and damnation. Since it is impossible to save themselves, humans need God's saving work on their behalf. That divine action, salvation, comes through Jesus Christ. In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul wrote, \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself\" (2 Cor. 5:19). The belief that God was in Christ is expressed in the Christian doctrine of incarnation, which teaches that Jesus, although fully human, was nonetheless the fullness of God. God chose to become human, voluntarily living a life of sinless obedience and suffering pain and death on the cross in order to reconcile humanity with divinity.\n(5) But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our trespasses; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his suffering we are healed.\n(7) He was oppressed and afflicted, but he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.\nChristianity uses rich imagery to describe this reconciliation by Jesus. For example, Christians use chapter 53 of the Book of Isaiah, which tells of God's suffering servant on whom is placed all the sins and burdens of the people, so that he can atone for them. The Gospel of Matthew likens Jesus' death to the payment of ransom, which is what redemption means (Matthew 20:28). The Gospel of John calls Jesus \"the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). This recalls the many accounts in the Old Testament of the sacrifice of a lamb to atone for the sins of the people. Jesus' death on the cross is the greatest sacrifice of all, for it redressed the sins of all humankind for all time, restoring the loving relationship between God and humans.\nIn the 11th century, Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote Why God Became Man, arguably the most influential explanation of the atonement in the west.

{"idx": "16821", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Op-Ed: Why does the British Government hate Google?\nLondon - The Public Accounts Committee is continuing to attack big companies like Amazon, Starbucks and especially Google over their allegedly avoiding tax. Do they want to drive them out of Britain?\nLast month, the Public Accounts committed lambasted Google over its alleged avoidance of corporation tax. This has continued this month with a verbal assault on the spokesman for Amazon. It is right that in this age of austerity every company should pay its fair share of tax. Or is it? To begin with, if these enormous multinational companies were doing anything illegal, a specialist police team would have long been called in. But the suggestion that they don't pay enough tax is an entirely different issue. They certainly do pay tax. They employ people in the UK and have premises here; Starbucks is said currently to have over 1500 stores in the UK. There are over 50 in the centre of London alone. All these stores have paid staff, which means the company pays national insurance. It will also pay VAT, rates and other expenses. It is generating wealth, providing people with livelihoods, and is evidently doing something of which the public approves, otherwise it would have gone bust long ago. In a relatively free market, the consumer is sovereign.\nSimilarly, Amazon is a massive company selling books and all sorts of other stuff on-line; it has premises all over the UK, which again means that it is generating wealth and affording people livelihoods.\nGoogle is in a different bracket from the other two; it has relatively few employees in the UK; currently it has three offices in Central London and one in Manchester, so one would not expect it to pay a great deal in the way of tax, but even if it paid not a cent, the benefits Google delivers to this country are worth far, far more than the mere \u00a36 million it is said to pay in corporation tax.\nIn addition to the free e-mail service it gives us - totally free - Google provides all manner of information with a few keystrokes; it can even help you find the shortest route when you are driving. But it is also helping fund the Endangered Languages project as well as continuing to scan and put on-line literally hundreds of thousands of books. If the British Government and other governments decided Google's excess profits should be confiscated - ie stolen - the company would not have been able to invest in these magnificent projects, projects which benefit all mankind. Instead, this money would have been stolen from Google and disappeared down that black hole known as the Treasury in order to \"pay down the deficit\" a tiny fraction as David Cameron likes to put it.\nThis attack on wealth creators like Google is even more absurd when one considers the way the Government is dealing with the banks. Under its new funding for lending scheme, it gave the banks over \u00a34 billion - literally gave it to them - in order for them to lend at interest to businesses. Unsurprisingly, the banks have been sitting on most of this money, probably depositing it elsewhere in order to earn interest.\nBanks produce no wealth themselves, they are first and foremost book-keepers and strongrooms. The Government should pay less attention to stealing the wealth of the nation by punitive taxation and more to promoting policies that generate wealth for all, because we live in the global village, and if big companies can't make money here in Britain, and lots of it, they will take their operations somewhere they can."}

Now, Google is extending its app-streaming capabilities to search advertisements, particularly targeting game developers looking to get their apps in front of more eyeballs.\nThe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary introduced the new feature to companies at its Game Developers Conference in mid-March, and will roll it out in the coming weeks. It aims to solve one of the biggest problems with app-install ads: consumers don't want to install something they're not sure they'll like. At the same time, it gives Google an edge in winning a larger share of app-install ad dollar, which Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has dominated.\nGoogle's new search ads, called Search Trial Run Ads, are similar to the in-app ads it rolled out just a month after its organic search streaming experiment. The key differences are that in-app Trial Runs lasted only a minute and they functioned more as display ads instead of search ads. Search ads are higher quality. Not only does the searcher express explicit interest in a game (e.g., \"crossword puzzle games\"), but users can spend up to 10 minutes before they're asked to download the app.\nDevelopers aren't charged unless the searcher clicks the Install button. And developers can expect a much higher return on investment if the user has already tried the game for a few minutes and decides they still want to play. That said, Google can expect a much higher price per ad on these units, but the conversion rate may be significantly lower than other ad formats, including standard app-install ads.\nLast July, Google introduced Search Ads on Google Play: ads that show up in search results when users are looking for apps in the Google Play store. These app-install ads theoretically have a high conversion rate because users are already searching for an app. Combining Google's app streaming platform with Search Ads on Google Play could make for an even higher-value product.\nThe app-install ad market is expected to grow to $5.6 billion this year, according to mobile analytics company Tune. Facebook doesn't break out its ad revenue by type, but estimates indicate that it takes the majority of revenue.\nGoogle introduced app-install ads across all of its properties over the past few years, including Search, YouTube, and the aforementioned Google Play Store ads. Outside of Google Play, none of Google's properties are particularly more compelling than Facebook, where users spend hours of their day. Management says one-in-five minutes spent on mobile is spent using a Facebook-owned app.\nBut app streaming differentiates Google's product, and integrating it into search advertisements makes for a very valuable lead generator. So, while Google might not be able to compete with the volume Facebook is able to achieve, it can compete for developer budgets by providing a better-converting ad product.\nWhile $5.6 billion isn't a huge market for Google, which generated $67 billion in gross ad revenue in 2015, it's one of the fastest-growing ad markets on mobile. Becoming more competitive with Facebook will help the company grow, especially as users continue to spend more time on mobile."}

Dallakian said the opposition does not trust this and other law-enforcement agencies.\nBaghdasarian angered other majority leaders last week when he admitted that there were serious irregularities during the vote. That might explain why lawmakers from the governing Republican Party (HHK) and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) pointedly chose not to help him fight back opposition attempts to include the issue on the parliament agenda. The 36-year-old speaker was grilled by Dallakian and other oppositionists for more than an hour and looked embarrassed at times.\nArtarutyun may still be able to force a parliament debate on its demand by collecting the signatures of at least one third of the assembly\u2019s 131 members. But the parliament majority will almost certainly block the creation of the proposed commission in any case. \u201cThe Republican Party will definitely not sign [a possible opposition petition] because only electoral commissions and courts can investigate electoral processes,\u201d its parliamentary leader, Galust Sahakian, told RFE/RL.\nAccording to the Central Election Commission, almost two thirds of Armenia\u2019s 2.3 million eligible voters took part in the referendum and over 93 percent of them voted for the constitutional amendments drafted by President Robert Kocharian and his governing coalition.

Kocharian (no relation to the Armenian president) is the only prominent oppositionist who has refused to campaign against the enactment of the proposed amendments.\nOpposition sources said this is the reason why the bloc\u2019s top leader, Stepan Demirchian, will likely replace him in the Armenian delegation at the Strasbourg-based assembly.

The launch aboard a Soyuz rocket is scheduled for 0136 GMT (9:36 p.m. EDT on July 6).\nThe Soyuz craft carrying commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese flight engineers Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins is an upgraded model of the venerable Russian crew transporter.\nThe Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft features more efficient solar panels to produce more electricity and a modernized navigation and control system with an improved, smaller and lighter Kurs rendezvous radar, which feeds range and closure rate data to the capsule\u2019s computers during approach to the space station. A digital video system replaces an analog system to improve video links with the space station during the Soyuz rendezvous with the outpost.\nEngineers also added upgrades to the Soyuz command and telemetry system, including a radio link with Russian data relay satellites in geostationary orbit, allowing communications between the Soyuz crew and flight controllers when the capsule is flying outside the range of ground stations.\nOther changes include a backup digital motion control system, upgraded angular velocity sensors for the Soyuz guidance system, and new LED lights, according to RSC Energia, the builder of the Soyuz spacecraft based near Moscow.\nRussia introduced similar upgrades to the Progress supply ship last year, and two Progress MS-series spacecraft successfully flew to the space station in December and April.

It also takes a lot of guts to jump off the side of a perfectly good building. Like the pair on display here, Wonderbra is attempting to jam those two things together in full support of its latest product.\nTo ensure that an ample proportion of potential buyers get an eyeful of the new Ultimate Plunge model, Wonderbra has devised one of the more literal, and head-scratching promotional stunts in recent memory. The company sent a group of women, apparently over-brimming with confidence, on a building-side bungee expedition against the backdrop of a giant underwear model. The daring divers went past a projection of the valley just beneath the model\u2019s sternum before bouncing back up again. One giant leap for womankind this was not.\nThe recently unveiled Ultimate Plunge Bra offers a cleavage deeper than Barry White\u2019s lower register, designed for those whom double-sided tape seems a stitch too far. A clear strip at the bottom holding the two cups together is barely visible\u2013although the display it helps create above means nobody will be looking at it anyway.\nIn launching the Ultimate Plunge, Wonderbra invited women to enter an online competition, the prize being an opportunity to bungee jump down a giant projection of model Adriana Cernanova, on the side of Battersea Power Station in London. (Cernanova is filling the void left behind by Eva Herzigova, whose \u201cHello Boys\u201d ad allegedly caused car crashes when it debuted 17 years ago.) It was a no-brainer which area on the model\u2019s body served as the dropzone for the contestants\u2019 leap. The effect was sort of a full-body motorboating in miniature.\nOddly enough, men were not permitted to enter the contest. Is it because Wonderbra\u2019s site lacks sufficient bandwidth to support all those submissions from eager bungee-enthusiasts? Or would the spectacle of men performing this stunt just have been too\u2026 ridiculous? Was the use of female jumpers a hilariously misguided hedge against charges of sexism? The Internet can barely contain all the possibilities, which will no doubt leave women deeply divided.\nWatch video of the plunge below."}

In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle. However, every little bit helps if you're frantically searching for car keys.\nChipolo Plus also claims to have twice the Bluetooth range (200 feet) of Tile and TrackR.

(Tile Slim has no key hole and is meant for use in a wallet or similar item.) Also like the Tile products, you can't replace Chipolo Plus's internal battery. When the Chipolo and Tile batteries expire after about one year, you throw them away and (presumably) buy a replacement. You can, however, replace TrackR bravo's coin battery.\nEach of the trackers have a community of users who can help locate missing items when they are out of Bluetooth range, at least in theory. If you lose your Chipolo Plus, for example, you can mark it as lost in its mobile app. \"When anyone running the app comes within Bluetooth range of your Chipolo, you will receive an alert notifying you of the location of your Chipolo,\" according to the company.\nChipolo's community is relatively small, with just a million users, compared to 5 million for Tile and 3.5 million for TrackR, so the odds of someone triggering a Chipolo alert for you are lower than if you used a Tile or TrackR. The trackers' mobile apps all also show items' last known locations on a map.\nIs Chipolo Plus, Tile or TrackR right for you?\nI've only used Chipolo Plus for about a week, but so far I like the look and size of the device. Its mobile app is simple and intuitive, and the tracker is loud enough to be a worthy addition to your keychain.

Based on each stress test, Treasury and bank regulators will decide if the government needs to provide additional capital to the banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve are conducting the tests.\nThose forecasts include a pessimistic scenario the Treasury released Feb. 25 under which the unemployment rate rises to 8.9% by the end of this year with home prices falling an additional 22% for the same period.\nHowever, many aspects of the negative scenario are, in fact, coming to pass. Joblessness rose to 8.5% by the end of March, and the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, on which the Treasury Department's pessimistic housing scenario is based, indicated March 31 that home prices had fallen 19% in the 12 months ending in January.\nAlston & Bird's Hare said he believes that bank regulators are now using the pessimistic scenario as their baseline forecast. He expects the results released in early May to show that banks will be viable for the next two years using the new baseline forecast, with some recommendations that certain financial institutions take six months or less to raise private capital before seeking government funding, he said.\nThe Fed and other regulators are expected to publish a paper on their methodologies for the stress test on April 24, according to a banking source. It could provide more details about a more pessimistic scenario then. Fed officials did not return calls.\nHowever, regulatory attorneys believe that neither regulators nor the banks will provide the kind of details the markets and analysts want. Hare said he doesn't believe the government will publicly provide a breakdown of each bank's loan portfolio.\n\"What markets were hoping to get -- specific details about each bank's viability if things get worse -- they're not going to get,\" said Hare. \"The stress test will fail, [but] banks will pass.\"\nNevertheless, regulatory analysts contend that government officials will have a thorough knowledge about each bank's capital composition, including loan portfolios and off-balance-sheet commitments, once they complete stress tests. Most of this information will be kept confidential, Hare said. Banks are expected to receive preliminary results of stress tests so they can make comments before the final results are provided.\nBased on the confidential data and new pessimistic assumptions, bank regulators may quietly explain to bankers that they need to raise more capital. However, those discussions are likely to remain private, said Kenneth Lore, partner at Bingham McCutchen LLP in Washington.\n\"You don't want to upset the capital markets with things that could be misconstrued,\" said Lore. \"The Fed understands that you don't want to create winners and losers out of the results.\"\nRegulators may also press banks seeking state-funded capital to participate in other government programs as"}
{"idx": "16856", "prompt": "Continue the following text: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Four in 10 Americans say they have \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of trust and confidence in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly. This ties the historical lows on this measure set in 2014 and 2012. Prior to 2004, slight majorities of Americans said they trusted the mass media, such as newspapers, TV and radio.\nAmericans' confidence in the media has slowly eroded from a high of 55% in 1998 and 1999. Since 2007, the majority of Americans have had little or no trust in the mass media. Trust has typically dipped in election years, including 2004, 2008, 2012 and last year. However, 2015 is not a major election year.\nThis decline follows the same trajectory as Americans' confidence in many institutions and their declining trust in the federal government's ability to handle domestic and international problems over the same time period.\nTrust in the media continues to be significantly lower among Americans aged 18 to 49 than among those 50 and older, continuing a pattern evident since 2012. Prior to 2012, these groups' trust levels were more similar, with a few exceptions between 2005 and 2008.\nFor more than a decade, Republicans and independents have been significantly less likely than Democrats to trust the media. This pattern continues in the latest survey. In 2014, Gallup found that trust among Democrats fell to a 14-year low of 54%, and this figure is essentially unchanged at 55% this year. While more Democrats than Republicans continue to say they trust the media, the percentage of Republicans who report that they trust the mass media increased slightly this year, from 27% to 32%. This increase was offset, however, by a decrease in independents reporting trust, from 38% to 33%.\nAmericans' trust level in the media has drifted downward over the past decade. The same forces behind the drop in trust in government more generally, as well confidence in many U.S. institutions, may also be at work with the media. But some of the loss in trust may have been self-inflicted. Major venerable news organizations have been caught making serious mistakes in the past several years, including the scandal involving former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams in 2015 that some of his firsthand accounts of news events had been exaggerated or \"misremembered.\"\nAmericans' distrust in the media hit a new high this year, with 60% saying they have little or no trust in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. The increase is driven by Republicans and independents."}

New studies counter Bush's view.\nKeep your eye on the climate, but your hand on your wallet.\nThat's the attitude the Bush administration takes in rejecting the Kyoto climate treaty: It will cost American jobs, causing as much as a 2 percent drop in US economic output over the next decade.\nBut a series of studies in the US, Europe, and Japan released in recent days suggests that if the Kyoto guidelines are implemented, the US and other industrial nations are likely to see only a slight decline of as little as 0.15 percent, or a modest economic boost of as much as 1 percent.\nThe studies may breathe new life into a global-emissions reduction plan that is in trouble without US participation. The US alone accounts for 25 percent of the world's carbon emissions.\nHow could such divergent conclusions be reached about Kyoto's impact?\nUntil now, \"the economic debate has not been conducted with a full deck of cards,\" says Florentin Krause, director of the International Project for Sustainable Energy Paths and a participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN working group looking at the economics of climate change.\nDr. Krause, along with Stephen DeCanio, a senior staff economist on the President's Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan, have tried to gauge the impact of the Kyoto accord on the US economy and on its international trade position.\nThey find that while some sectors, such as the coal industry, would be seriously affected, the US economy as a whole stands to gain from ratifying the protocol. They arrived at this conclusion by altering five widely cited federal and university economic simulations so that the models take advantage of the full range of approaches the IPCC recommended to soften Kyoto's potential economic blow.\nUntil now, Krause says, each study analyzed the impact of Kyoto and assumed the US adopts some of IPCC recommendations, but no study shows the effect of adopting all of the approaches. These include a carbon-trading scheme within the US, continued voluntary energy conservation, efficiency, and technology R&amp;D programs, using the revenue from domestic carbon trading to offset cuts in taxes, and participating in international carbon-trading markets.\nWhen these approaches are fully used to offset the cost of implementation in the five economic models, the US economy shows a 0.5 percent to 1 percent gain in gross domestic product, instead of ranging from 0.09 percent growth to a 4 percent drop. President Bush's Cabinet-level task force cited a projected 1 percent to 2 percent drop in GDP in its criticism of the protocol's effect on the US economy.\nThe new results land in the same ballpark as those the Clinton administration derived when it analyzed the effect of implementing Kyoto, says Ian Bowles, a research fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a top member of Mr. Clinton's negotiating team sent to The Hague last November.\n\"Our models were pretty brittle,\" he concedes. \"They couldn't factor in technological innovation over time.\" Overall, the Clinton administration came up with an implementation price tag of about $20 billion a year, about one-third smaller than the annual cost of implementing the Clean Air Act, he says.\nA separate study by the Dutch consulting group ECOFYS Energy and Environment in Utrecht, Netherlands, projects that the European Union could meet its targets at a cost no greater than 0.15 percent of GDP by 2010, while a post-Kyoto Japanese GDP grew about 0.9 percent"}
{"idx": "16858", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life.\nThis week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.\nCouscous came into my life as a very young kitten. She had been found abandoned, too young to survive on her own. The team at my clinic had taken pity on her, and they'd nurtured her, bottle-feeding her at first, then weaning her on to solid food. She was an affectionate kitten with an ultra-loud purr, and that's what I found so appealing. I brought her home one weekend to do my share of caring for her, and while she was with me, she purred so loudly that I decided to keep her. That was over thirteen years ago.\nAs Couscous grew older, she turned out to be an exceptionally nervous, flighty type of cat. She still purrs loudly with people that she knows well, but if a stranger ever visits our house, Couscous vanishes. She hightails out of the cat flap, and rushes out into the garden, hiding out of sight. We've had other cats over the years who have been far more relaxed and sociable, but Couscous has always had the gentle charm of a shy animal. It's a real honour if she trusts you enough to sit beside you, purring loudly.\nCouscous was always a fit, lean animal, and she managed to avoid major health crises. The only problem she suffered from was sunburn on her left ear tip. Her ear tip is white, and that means it contains no skin pigment to protect it from the ultraviolet radiation of the sun. Every summer, the tip of the ear has turned a red colour, and every winter, it has returned to normal. Ideally, I know that she ought to have had regular sun block applied to that ear tip, to protect it. The challenge for us, as owners, has been that Couscous is so nervous that whenever anyone approached her with sun cream, she rushed away before she could be caught and held still. And we knew that if we did manage to corner her, and apply the stuff, she would head off on her own for several days. And the next time she saw anyone approaching her, she'd be doubly impossible to catch. For this reason, we adopted a \"monitoring from a distance\" approach. Couscous was fortunate in that her mild sunburn never progressed to cancer, which would have meant that she'd have had to have her ear amputated.\nA few weeks ago, we suspected that one of our animals was drinking more water than usual: at first, we didn't actually see any of them doing this, but we did notice that the bowl needed to be filled up more frequently. We started to keep a careful watch of each of the two dogs and the two cats. After a few days, it was clear: Couscous was sneaking up to the water bowl at times when she thought there was no-one watching, and she was definitely lapping up the liquid for longer than normal.\nIf someone told me that their pet was doing this, I would recommend a visit to the vet. Luckily for Couscous, this did not mean a trip"}

On Sunday night, the Sun Devils played in another down-to-the-wire matchup.\nIt ultimately came down to the final possessions, causing emotions to swirl about Watsco Center. Miami (25-9) had a chance with five seconds left as senior center Emese Hof had a decent opportunity for a game-tying contested layup.\nAfter she released the ball, with the clock winding down, the ball bounced off the backboard and rolled across the rim.

No point, though, was more crucial than the midrange shot Elenga made with 1:53 left to give ASU a 55-53 lead.\nAs the shot clock ticked away, Elenga caught a pass from junior guard Reili Richardson, and she took the wide-open opportunity.\nAfter that, some chaos ensued as Miami redshirt junior guard Laura Cornelius, who finished with a team-high 15 points, made a tough layup to tie the game at 55. On the next play, senior forward Kianna Ibis missed a shot for ASU, then Hurricanes redshirt junior forward Beatrice Mompremier had a layup chance for Miami.\nAlthough Mompremier set a career-high on Sunday with 22 rebounds, she couldn\u2019t find a groove on offense thanks to tough post and all-around defense from the Sun Devils. Mompremier missed the shot, then Ryan missed a three-pointer and Elenga missed a hook shot on the other end, giving Miami a chance to win the game with 10.2 seconds left.\nBut shockingly, ASU stole the inbounds pass as Ryan poked the ball toward Ekmark.\n\u201c(Ryan) knew that I was going to get it, so she just took off and yelled my name, and I just chucked it up to her,\" Ekmark said. \"It ended up being perfect.\"\nRyan corralled the outlet pass and as she went for a layup, Hof fouled her, sending her to the free-throw line.\nShe calmly knocked down"}

Dave Walling, vice president of marketing for IBM storage systems, termed the newly launched ProFibre Storage Array DF4000R as \"RAID for NT.\" It is actually aimed at Windows NT/2000, Linux and low-end Unix systems.\nThe DF4000R is an array of hard drives that can be configured to meet a range of Redundant Array of Independent Disks requirements, from minimal redundancy and backup to full RAID 5 requirements, with data mirrored in a real-time duplicate set. RAID units replaced high volume, single unit disk drives designed for mainframes and large servers with multiple PC component drives that can back each other up and weed out a failed drive.\nInstead of being a stand-alone, server attached device, the DF4000R is equipped with Fibre Channel-based controllers that allow it to be plugged into a high-speed Fibre Channel storage area network. Many storage devices may be linked on the network to multiple servers or remote servers. Fibre Channel is a standard for storage area networks that can operate at data transmission speeds of 2 gigabytes per second.\nIBM's RAID unit will be priced in the $25,000-to-$30,000 range, compared with $100,000 or more for a Unix storage unit with similar capacities, Walling said. The DF4000R can move data at a sustained 350 megabytes per second, manage 100,000 transactions per second and hold up to 1.1 terabytes of data. The unit contains 15 disks, each holding 73 gigabytes.\nThe vibration set up by the platters of so many high-speed spinning disks prompted an advanced enclosure design. Although it looks like the sheet metal of other RAID units, the enclosure is actually made from a sandwich of two metal sheets with a plastic material in between. When dropped on a hard surface, a sample of the material provided by IBM makes a flat noise with little bounce. If an equal thickness of regular sheet metal were dropped, it would bounce with a clang, indicating a higher level of vibration from the blow.\nThe vibration dampening is important, said Walling, because build up of vibration in RAID arrays leads to diminished performance. The disk drives are not failing, but the vibration makes it harder for the tracking device on the disk drive head to know exactly where it is over the spinning platter. If vibration interferes with the head placement, the device waits for the platter to make another revolution before identifying the track it is about to read, he said.\nThe vibration problem is likely to escalate in the next generation of RAID arrays because platter speeds will move from 10,000 revolutions per minute to 15,000, according to Walling. And, the DF4000R can dampen vibration equivalent \"to a door being shut hard, an elevator going up or down or a minor earthquake,\" he said.\nIBM's DF4000R can be equipped as a dual RAID controller storage unit."}

But especially by winning in the playoffs. Facebook data show that a playoff win results in more than twice as many new \u201clikes\u201d as a playoff loss, and nearly five times as many as a regular-season win. In other words, an awful lot of Facebook users make their fandom official only once their team is in the national limelight.\nFacebook\u2019s data also reveal which team commands the most fans in each county across the country (or, at any rate, the most fans eager to declare their allegiances on a social network). The first map shows the breakdown for all 32 NFL squads. The findings are mostly predictable\u2014Tennesseans support their Titans, San Diegans back the Chargers\u2014but there are some fascinating intricacies and anomalies.\nIn Ohio, for instance, the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals hold down their respective metropolitan areas, but lose out to the Pittsburgh Steelers across most of the rest of the state, including the capital. The mighty Steelers\u2019 reach extends, incredibly, to pockets of Oregon, Nevada, Alabama, and Alaska, plus the entirety of Hawaii. The poor New York Jets, meanwhile, hold just a single county on Long Island. Perhaps even more ignominiously, the Oakland Raiders lose not only their own home county but the entire Bay Area to the more glamorous 49ers, though they make up for it by winning Los Angeles and a swath of Southern Oregon. And is that a patch of New York Giants territory in Central Florida?\nWhen limited to the 12 teams that made the playoffs this year, the map turned strikingly orange as the Denver Broncos gobbled up a bunch of Dallas Cowboys territory. Of course, not all counties are created equal, and the Broncos\u2019 contingent would surely be dwarfed by that of the New England Patriots\u2019 in terms of actual population. (Facebook did not release hard numbers of \u201clikes\u201d for each team, only the counties in which they held a plurality.)

Alexander Rollins sings, \"Followed the dark down to the deep end of her eyes/ She took my hand, she said 'jump in, the water's fine'/ She painted a fool/ She pulled me in.\"\nBy the time the chorus hits you over the head with heavy drums, pulsating synths, and down-tuned vocals, all at max intensity, it dawns on you that this alluring woman took him on a wild ride and then quickly tossed him aside. This song is delivered from the perspective of a man waking up alone in what I would presume to be the Hollywood Hills, seeing as the track was recorded in Los Angeles and manages to capture a certain glitzy and glamorously dark sound that could easily be heard in a Hollywood night club.\n\"Woke Up in the Hills\" is the rare kind of song that makes just as much sense being bumped at a party as it does serving as the backdrop to your wandering thoughts on a solitary late night drive. Denny is proving that the gloom of new wave and the excitement of EDM can coexist in the same space, that electronic music can be both fun and cathartic all at once.\nDustin DiPaulo is a writer and musician from Rochester, New York.

{"idx": "16882", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Bottles (from left) Pimento dram, old rum, old white rum, Jamaica brandy and Anisou.\nRecently, there has been a string of videos circulating on social media featuring inebriated persons expressing their love for rum in song. The lyrics of these songs vary, and some of them are remixes of hymns or popular songs, but the message remains the same that rum, more specifically, Wray and Nephew over proof rum, is a 'friend to the end'.\nThe number and popularity of these videos makes one wonder about rum, its beginnings, and how it became a drinker's best friend.\nFor many Caribbean people, especially Jamaicans, a bottle of rum is a household staple, even if none of the persons who live in the household are drinkers.\nThis is because rum plays a vital role in the lives of persons as it is used to celebrate happy occasions and as a shoulder to lean on in times of grief. White rum is a very important ingredient in homeopathic remedies, and it also finds a space in the spiritual realm in religions such as Kumina and Revival. Today we will explore Jamaica's most famous export outside of reggae music: Wray and Nephew Rum.\nAccording to Barty-King and Massel (1983), the Spanish and the Portuguese first brought the sugar cane plant to the Caribbean in the 15th century as part of a new range of crops that were introduced to the region at the time. Evidence suggests that the early settlers in the Caribbean cultivated the sugar cane plant not for its sugar, but for this spirit beverage. Settlers appeared to be so determined to do this that laws were passed in the Leeward Islands between 1644 and 1673 that imposed fines on all who distilled the cane juice rather than making sugar from it.\nSources indicate that rum has been called by many names throughout the Caribbean. For example, in Barbados, it was called 'Barbados water', and in the French Caribbean, it was called 'tafia' and 'guildive', the latter meaning 'kill devil', (Tony Talburt, 2010). The term 'kill devil' became an enduring term by which rum was referred to in numerous locations.\nEventually, the name 'kill devil' was usurped by the word 'rum', Deer (1949) suggests that the word rum was adopted from the names of the three main varieties or species of sugar cane that were introduced into the Caribbean region, namely saccharium spontaneum, robustum and officinarum. Other scholars such as Vandyke Prince (1979) claimed that the word 'rum' first appeared in the English language in 1654 and may have been taken from the word 'rumbustion' which probably signified a loud noise or even a strong liquor.\nIn Jamaica, the development of a rum industry can be traced back to one of Jamaica's oldest and most successful business houses. In 1825, Charles Wray opened the Shakespeare Tavern which F.C. Casserly (1958) describes as appropriately named because it was located next to one of \"the most fashionable theatres in the New world, the Theatre Royal\" (which today is the Ward Theatre).\nCasserly explains that the tavern was very successful because the theatre, which had stood at its current location since 1775, was the place where English touring companies would make their first call before going north to America.

But in a letter faxed to The Sun yesterday, that state's newly elected attorney general, Jennifer M. Granholm, wrote, \"I have made no plans to sue gun manufacturers.\"\nOf the states considering suits, the newly elected New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, appears closer to filing. Spitzer's office has been talking with the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington, a leading proponent of using litigation against the industry. A spokesman for Spitzer confirmed Monday that a decision on whether to file suit will be made in the next few weeks.\n\"We are on the verge,\" said Marc E. Violette, Spitzer's spokesman. \"Eliot Spitzer does not think the flow of guns into the state from the South is an accident. This is a priority concern of his.\"\nThe legal war against gun manufacturers has been waged entirely by municipalities, not the states, which used lawsuits to force the tobacco industry into a $206 billion settlement. During the past four months, five cities -- New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami and Bridgeport, Conn. -- have filed lawsuits against the industry.\nLawyers and advocates of the gun litigation say the cities' leadership is based on two facts: The harm caused by gun violence is largely concentrated in urban areas, and the gun industry tends to be less popular in politically liberal big cities than in states as a whole.\nState attorneys general have expressed skepticism about the chances of winning. But some appear to have been emboldened by a landmark verdict in New York federal court this month. In that case, Hamilton vs. Accu-Tek et al., jurors found gun manufacturers liable for three shootings. Industry lawyers are appealing.\n\"If it's true that states are going forward, it's a new development,\" said Wendell Gauthier, a Louisiana lawyer who represents New Orleans in its lawsuit. \"I think it's clear now that the gun companies are beatable.\"\n\"I don't understand what kind of claim they could hope to make, but I'm hearing that some states want to go forward,\" says Jack Adkins, vice president of the Atlanta-based American Shooting Sports Council, a gun industry trade group. \"It seems that states like Michigan may be racing to beat New York.\"\nThe states' effort faces significant political hurdles. New York, Connecticut, and Michigan all have politically ambitious Republican governors who are likely to face strong pressure from the gun industry to short-circuit the suits. Connecticut is home to two of America's largest and most storied gun companies: Colt's Manufacturing Co. Inc. of Hartford, and Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. of Southport.\nBut lawyers said the attorneys general could file suit without the approval of the governor."}

{"idx": "16896", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Plant-based eating is not only healthy, but it offers us a significant way to lower our carbon emissions.\nWith the latest IPCC report on the dire effects of climate change, we know the status quo is no longer an option if we want our economy to survive the upcoming decades of droughts, fires, flooding, food shortages and mass migration. The University of Chicago recently reported that if every American ate just one meat meal less per week, it would be the equivalent of taking 500,000 cars off the road annually.\nTo that end, why aren\u2019t we all addressing climate change at each meal by skipping the meat? We buy electric cars and limit our gas consumption, yet Oxford University found that livestock agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases (GHGs) than all cars, buses, planes, trains and all transport combined. I recently attended the United Nations\u2019 COP24 conference with a business delegation of leaders from BWBR Architects, Target and Best Buy. Experts from around the world brought new research on land and water use in animal agriculture and how it was contributing more than was originally estimated to environmental devastation.\nPlant-based eating is not only healthy, but it offers us a significant way to lower our carbon emissions. Why hasn\u2019t this been proposed as an immediate solution in addition to green technologies and carbon tax? It has. The United Nations published a study in 2006 warning that if we continue to tear down rainforests in order to make room for more livestock production, we could be facing huge increases in GHGs. At the time, they were not even factoring in the methane cows produce, which is 28 times more powerful than CO2.\nResiding in a progressive agriculture state, we have a responsibility to understand how we are contributing to global warming and what solutions we can bring to farmers to help them. According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, the meat and dairy industry have announced projected a 30 percent increase in sales by the year 2030, which is directly at odds with meeting our goals from the Paris Agreement. But the IATP also has tools for farmers to shift to new crops that are more environmentally sustainable and align with climate goals.\nI invite you to \u201cDine for Climate\u201d at Fig + Farro this Jan. 21, from 5 to 9 p.m., where 30 percent of your meal will go directly to support Climate Generation\u2019s climate change education and advocacy programming here in Minnesota and beyond. We should consider ourselves fortunate that the way to reduce our individual carbon footprint is as easy as eating a delicious meal.\nMichelle Courtright is the owner of Fig + Farro Restaurant in Minneapolis.\nSubmitted by John Evans on 01/07/2019 - 11:49 am.\nWhen it comes to carbon footprint all meats are not equal. Pound for pound, beef is the worst. Pork is, maybe, half as bad. A pound of chicken may have one tenth the environmental impact of a pound of beef.\nThe least environmentally harmful domestic animal you can eat is probably goat. It\u2019s also the world\u2019s most popular meat."}

Teaming up with directors Joe and Anthony Russo for the fourth time for MCU's Phase 3 capper, Markus, alongside writing partner Stephen McFeely, began working on the story of the twin Avengers sequels as early as 2016. Pulling off the surprise ending in Avengers 3, many are looking forward to what the foursome have concocted for the next Marvel ensemble flick.\nConsidering how Infinity War ended, there's a myriad of ways that Avengers 4 can go about. So far, both time-travel and the Quantum Realm are expected to factor in the film's narrative. Among the slew of unsolved mysteries waiting for an answer, and perhaps one of the most talked about one (alongside how dead heroes can be brought back to life), is the way an all-powerful being like Thanos can be defeated.\nIn Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War - The Art of the Movie, Markus raised some good points on how Thanos might go down in Avengers 4. While he kept his comments as vague as possible, there are a couple of interesting details from his sentiments that might (or might not) offer some clues on what to expect in the still-untitled flick.\nThey've been misused by people who didn't understand their true power. And now that the real master of them, Thanos, has shown up we can see what they actually do. The problem is, as you can imagine, as you gain control over these things, your story just goes haywire because why are there any stakes for the man who can control time, space, reality, your mind, your soul and power? He can reset as many times as it'll take. So you have to build in a lot of bumps in the road or maybe keep one stone away from him for long enough in order for the thing to have any dramatic structure at all.\nThere a couple of main points from Markus' comments that Avengers 4 theorists might find helpful the next time they put their tin foil hats on. From the sound of it, Thanos utilizing the power of all the Infinity Stones at once could have an unknown consequence. By the end of the movie, the Mad Titan's whole left arm (as well as the Gauntlet) looked burned following him enacting the snap. Perhaps other than this, there have been other repercussions to his actions that fans have yet to learn that could ultimately spark his defeat come Avengers 4. After all, rumor has it there that there's a bigger threat than the Mad Titan in the movie.\nAnother notable point from the writer pertains to the reclaiming one (if not all) Infinity Stones from Thanos. This lends credence to previous theories about the possibility that Doctor Strange may have sent the Time Stone to the future or cast a spell on it in order to derail Thanos' plans. Meanwhile, other speculations claim that the remaining heroes will travel back in time to take the elemental crystals one-by-one, effectively re-writing history and preventing Thanos' snap at the end of Infinity War.\nWhatever spells the end for Thanos, one thing is for sure: the remaining heroes will stop at nothing to ensure that order is restored in the universe even if it means sacrificing their own lives for the greater good in Avengers 4. This way, not only will Marvel Studios be able to craft perfect finale to their 22-film narrative, but it will also"}

On Monday, another fissure spewing lava and toxic gas opened up, and a crack in the earth that emerged a day earlier was sending molten rock crawling toward the ocean, officials said. Nearly 20 fissures have opened since the Kilauea volcano started erupting 12 days ago, and officials warn it may soon blow its top with a massive steam eruption that would shoot boulders and ash miles into the sky.\nBecause the community sits in a zone deemed by the U.S. Geological Survey to have a high risk of lava, few insurance companies will issues policies there.\nBut homeowners are not without options. One possibility is the Hawaii Property Insurance Association, a nonprofit collection of insurance companies created by state lawmakers in 1991 to provide basic property insurance for people who are unable to buy coverage in the private market.\nThe horror of seeing houses turned to ash has motivated some people who went without insurance to scramble to purchase a policy. The association announced last week that it would issue policies to uninsured homeowners in the affected area \u2014 but they will have to wait six months.\nSome homeowners believe fire coverage will suffice for homes burned by fire from the lava. And a list of frequently asked questions from the Hawaii Insurance Division supports that idea, saying that lava damage may be covered \"as a fire peril.\"\nHowever, there are exceptions. Judy Moa, an insurance broker who specializes in catastrophic coverage for Hawaii, said if a policy specifically excludes lava damage, then a policy's fire coverage would not apply.\n\"The cause of damage is lava at the end of the day,\" she said. \"If lava came down the hill, and they have lava exclusion and trees catch fire, which burn the house, that's not covered.\"\nSome homeowners forgo policies that include lava coverage because they can cost more than $3,000 per year, said Moa, who has fielded many calls from anxious homeowners.\nThe same insurance questions haunt people whose homes are standing but could still be torched by future lava flows.\nTodd Corrigan and his wife left their Leilani Estates home on May 4 after a magnitude-6.9 earthquake knocked belongings off their shelves. That jolt convinced them it was time to evacuate.\nCorrigan said the most stressful part of the experience might be the uncertainty about what insurance will cover. His policy will pay for damage from a fire but not from lava. His insurer also cautioned him that it will not cover damage if he has not been at home for 30 days. That requirement could be a problem if he is gone for a long time.\n\"You have to worry about that stress when you're trying to deal with everything else,\" Corrigan said.\nCoverage details vary depending on policies and companies, said Insurance Division Commissioner Gordon Ito, who encouraged homeowners to contact their agents and find out what is covered.\nState Farm stopped writing policies for homes in the two highest-risk lava zones in the 199"}

The typewriter Jack uses is a German-made Adler (and, curiously, changes color throughout the film). The famous room where something awful lurks in the bathtub, numbered 217 in the book, was changed to 237 for the movie (2 x 3 x 7 = \u201942, the year the Nazis decided to exterminate all Jews).\nThe truth is that the owners of the Timberline Lodge in Oregon, which stood in for the exterior of the Overlook Hotel in the movie, asked Kubrick to change the number because they have no room 237, so people couldn\u2019t request to stay there. But The Shining is screened in the hotel\u2019s lobby every night, and guests still pop in to watch a bit of the film after a day of skiing \u2014 a testament to the movie\u2019s hypnotic power.

Sailing into the bay with zero visibility was a perilous undertaking, so the captain was waiting for the fog to lift.\nThe 345-foot ship had left Hong Kong more than a month before and was already three days behind schedule because of mechanical problems along the way. Now, just four miles from home, it was being delayed yet again.\nBut Ward was under pressure to get his ship into port. The City of Rio de Janeiro was carrying an important passenger: Rounseville Wildman, the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, traveling with his wife, Letitia, and their two young children. The night before, during dinner at the captain\u2019s table, Wildman and his wife had both complained that the delay had already inconvenienced them.\nAt 4 a.m., the fog lifted slightly. Jordan gave orders to heave anchors. But the fog thickened again, and Jordan reversed his orders. He then left the bridge, probably to confer with Ward, who was in bed. When he returned, he ordered the anchors raised and the engines started. The captain appeared a few minutes later in his nightclothes.\nAt this moment, either Ward or Jordan could have taken a crucial precaution: They could have ordered depth soundings, which would have informed them if the ship was entering dangerously shallow waters. But taking soundings was time consuming and would have further delayed the voyage. Neither man ordered soundings taken.\nThe ship moved forward at half-speed on a 6-knot ebb tide, into the enveloping mist and toward the jagged rocks off Fort Point.\nIs there a treasure buried in a ship that sank in the bay 117 years ago? No one's entirely sure.\nMoments later, the City of Rio de Janeiro smashed into the reef. The impact ripped a huge gash in its bottom, and seawater poured in. The ship had only two watertight bulkheads, so the below-decks stern section rapidly filled with water.\nYet the vessel remained upright, balanced precariously on the ledge it had struck. There was little panic among the 210 passengers and crew. In fact, many did not think they were in any danger at all.\nThe crew was ordered to launch the lifeboats. But in contrast to the officers, nearly the entire 84-member crew was Chinese. Few spoke English, and the process was chaotic \u2014 only three of the 11 lifeboats ended up being lowered into the water.\nThree minutes after the ship ran aground, the electrical lights below the deck went out. For the steerage passengers, many of whom were Chinese, this created additional confusion. Some never made it to the deck.\nAfter about 20 minutes, Consul Wildman was in a lifeboat, waiting for his wife, who was descending a rope ladder. Pilot Jordan was behind her, holding the couple\u2019s 9-year-old son. The Wildmans\u2019 2-year-old daughter was on the deck, waiting to descend.\nSuddenly the ship gave a violent lurch, slipped off the shelf of rock, slid into the deep water and keeled over. That moment spelled doom for more than half the passengers and crew.\nSurvivors from the City of Rio de Janeiro after"}

When I was younger there was a bit of a snicker and some jokes about that particular name for a town.\n\"But then as I left Crystal Beach and made a life for myself in Vancouver, it sort of took on an ironic and nostalgic quality to it, especially after I came out as queer. I thought, 'Of course I grew up in a town where the major road is Sodom Road.' I kept returning to it \u2014 and then once I was really thick in writing this novel, I knew that Sodom Road Exit it would indeed be the title.\"\n\"Can you think of a worse possibility for a 23-year-old who really wants to live a big city life than to have to live with their mother? The main character wants to come out. She wants to enjoy art and literature and culture and cinema. Instead of this dream that she's built for herself, she's returned right back to the very place that she worked so hard to get away from. It's the worst possibility.\"\n\"I needed to make an horrific, terrible possibility for her so that the ghost story could live as sort of a simultaneous tragedy. So there is the haunting and there's also sort of the grim reality of Starla's debt. She's also grappling with some recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse and she's struggling with her queer identity. So there's a lot going on for her. I really wanted to layer the conflicts on Starla throughout this book and give her sort of a multi-dimensional journey that she needed to go on.\"\nAmber Dawn's comments have been edited for length and clarity."}

Smartwatches haven't taken over the world the way Apple (or Google, or Pebble) may have hoped.

To change our perception that time goes more quickly as we age, we need to carve in a bit of time to just be, says astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser.\nWe humans have this uncanny ability to tell time and create schemes to measure its passage.\nTime is our greatest ally and our greatest enemy.\nWe exist in it, are bound by it. We all have a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning, we haven't much of a choice about; it just happens, thanks to our parents. The middle, well, that's the challenge, what to do with the decades we have allocated to us; how to live a life of meaning, given the many compromises, disputes and limitations of existence. And the end, the unspoken, the terrible finality of life, the elephant in everyone's closet, the ultimate demonstration of our powerlessness against nature's unrelenting force. That one we speak little of, naively believing silence equates with oblivion.\nNo wonder people feel time is hurrying up as they age. I hear this often, people asking whether there is some kind of astronomical phenomenon going on that's speeding up time. This time is, essentially, the duration of a day, the precise ticks and tocks of clocks. And it turns out that, at least astronomically, the very opposite is happening. Existential time, of course, is another story.\nA day is defined in different ways and it has different names. As a unit of time, we define a solar day as having 24 hours or, better, 86,400.002 seconds \u2014 what we use in our clocks. There are 365.242 solar days in one mean tropical year. (And a tropical year is the time it takes for the sun to return to the same position in the sky as seen from the Earth.) Now, because the Earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to the vertical as it orbits the sun, and it wobbles like a spinning top (the precession of the equinoxes), the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes for the Earth to complete a full orbit around the sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars (called the sidereal year).\nConfusing? Perhaps a bit. But what's really interesting is that the moon plays a key role in the duration of a day defined as the time it takes for the Earth to spin once around its axis. The gravitational pull from the moon (and from the sun with one-fifth of the force) acts harder on the side of the Earth facing it. This causes the planet (and, more effectively, the oceans) to bulge. Since the Earth rotates around itself faster than the moon orbits it, this watery bulge travels ahead of the moon. The net result is that the extra mass from the tidal bulge tugs at the moon, giving it an orbital boost, while the friction on the ocean floor acts to brake Earth's rotation ever so slightly.\nIn the end, Earth's spinning slows down by about 1.7 milliseconds per century, while the moon slowly drifts away from us. In other words, if we think of a day as the time for Earth to complete a turn around its axis, days are getting longer, not shorter. For example, fossil records indicate that some 620 million years ago, a day lasted 21.9 hours"}

The improvement in that key metric of a country\u2019s financial health has been a product of a fast-growing economy and good fiscal management by the government.\nIn the first nine months of this year, government debt has risen by 33 billion shekels ($8.9 billion), or 4.4%. That\u2019s about in line with the target of the Finance Ministry, which seeks to raise an average of 4 billion shekels a month, gross, in the domestic market.\nStill, the ministry has been looking carefully at the latest figures for GDP growth from the Central Bureau of Statistics. If the growth slowdown continues, the treasury will have a hard time continuing to cut the debt ratio.\nThe accountant general says the government debt (which is only the debt of the national government) was 59.2% of GDP in 2017. Total public sector debt, which includes, for example, local governments\u2019 debt, was 60.9%.\nFifteen years ago, the figure was 100%, and in the middle of the 1980s it was 180%. The ratio has been declining since 2004, with a short break during the global economic crisis. If the figure doesn\u2019t fall this year, it will be the first time since 2009.\nIn August, the Bank of Israel warned that, barring any surprises, total debt would probably increase to 61% this year from the bank\u2019s estimate of 60.4% for 2017.\nIn shekel terms, debt has grown 50% in the past 15 years, but this isn\u2019t an unusually big increase and by itself no reason to worry. Israel\u2019s economy grew even faster in those years.\nWhat\u2019s worrying is that this year economic growth and debt growth may be growing at the same pace. The real rate of GDP growth in 2018 is expected to be about 3.5%, according to most economists \u2013 though the treasury measures nominal growth when it looks at debt.\nIsrael\u2019s declining debt has helped boost its credit rating, reducing borrowing costs and thus letting the government spend on other programs, whether education, health or defense.\nConcerns about the deficit have taken on added resonance in recent weeks after the Finance Ministry said that in the 12 months through October the deficit had grown to 3.6% of GDP, far above the 2018 target of 2.9%.\nThat marks a sea change from recent years when the deficit came in under target, mainly due to one-time tax windfalls that boosted collections above what the treasury had forecast.\nThe debt ratio was also lowered by a strong shekel, which made the government\u2019s foreign currency obligations less expensive in shekel terms. More recently the shekel has weakened against the dollar. Only about 14% of Israeli debt was foreign debt as of the second quarter, but because of the weaker shekel this number rose sharply from just 11.5% at the end of 2017.\nIn any case, even if 2018 ends well, 2019 is expected to be more challenging. GDP isn\u2019t expected to grow significantly faster, but the budget deficit is expected to widen. The combination of slower growth and a growing deficit will increase the debt-to-GDP ratio unless the finance minister acts by cutting spending and/or raising"}

The detainees appeared to have been mostly Sunni Arabs, a group that has long contended that Shi'ite Muslim militias close to the political parties that dominate Iraq's ruling coalition are carrying out a shadowy campaign of vendettas against perceived political and sectarian foes.\nThe discovery Sunday of the makeshift prison, with prisoners held in murky circumstances, lent credibility to those charges. The new scandal also threatened to exacerbate sectarian rifts at a time when the US military and Iraqi government had been taking steps to mend them.\nSoldiers of the US Army's Third Infantry Division and Iraqi troops found the prisoners when, acting on a tip and searching for a missing teenager, they demanded to enter the bunker-like building hidden away in a quiet, well-to-do neighborhood near Baghdad University.\nThe injuries were significant enough that medical care was summoned to the site. The deputy interior minister, Major General Hussein Kamal, said some of the prisoners had been paralyzed by the beatings they had received, and in some cases their skin had been peeled off by abusers. Jaafari said there were apparent ''torture marks\" on some detainees.\nJournalists have not been given access to the prisoners, who have since been moved to another, more suitable location, according to the government.\nFacing parliamentary election next month, Jaafari's Shi'ite-led government appeared to want to move quickly to mitigate the impact of the reported abuse and address the question of whether other such sites exist.\nThe US Embassy and multinational forces congratulated Jaafari for his quick promise to investigate. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and General George Casey, the two ranking US officials in Iraq, have discussed the condition of the detainees in the Interior Ministry jail with Iraq's leaders ''at the highest level,\" a joint statement said.\nThe statement called the mistreatment of detainees ''totally unacceptable\" and said that the US government, including officials from the FBI and Department of Justice, would give technical help ''to investigate, prosecute and bring to justice\" anyone responsible.\nAmnesty International, responding to the report, said it welcomed the government's investigation and asked that it be expanded to include all allegations of torture in Iraq.\nStanding outside the facility in the Jadiriya neighborhood last night, Kamal blamed the alleged prisoner abuse on inexperienced and untrained officers who were brought into the police force during the chaotic days following the ouster of former president Saddam Hussein.\nThe low-slung building, which appeared from the outside to have been constructed as a bomb shelter during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988, covers about an acre of southern Baghdad.

His alleged treatment of Hall of Famer Jerry West is both.\nAccording to Grantland's Zach Lowe, \"Jackson has asked that Jerry West, a high-level adviser in Golden State, not attend most practices and team activities,\" because, well, we don't really know.\nMaybe Jackson isn't impressed by West's 25,192 career points. Or maybe the glare off West's 1972 NBA championship ring gets in his eyes.\nOr maybe Jackson is a compulsive micromanager with no clear rhyme or reason to what he does.\nLike he tends to do in these situations, Jackson denied Lowe's findings.\n\"That's a lie,\" Jackson told USA Today's Sam Amick after Golden State's Game 5 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. \"Come on. That's a lie. That's disrespectful.\"\nIs it a lie, though?\nJackson made a show of firing Scalabrine in front of players and other coaches, but he had no real grounds, and the front office made Jackson find a compromise, per a source familiar with the matter: demoting Scalabrine to the D-League.\nThe tension with Erman got weird. Midseason, the team moved Erman\u2019s parking spot to a less convenient place, likely at the behest of Jackson or one of Jackson\u2019s allies on the staff, per multiple sources familiar with the matter. They began changing his duties in strange ways.\nParking-spot politics are the worst.\nWorking for or alongside Jackson might be the worst.\nChris Broussard of ESPN The Magazine reports that Erman was canned for \"secretly recording conversations between the team's coaches and players,\" while Scal was essentially demoted for exhibiting a \"consistent pattern of disrespect toward Jackson and the other coaches.\" Sources also told Amick that West has, in fact, been seen at recent Warriors practices, so there is a chance Jackson's actions are being exaggerated.\nThere's too much smoke for there not to be some sort of fire. As a fiercely candid, outspoken individual, it wouldn't be surprising to hear that Jackson is making waves within the Warriors organization. It also wouldn't come as a shock to anyone if he's dismissed after this season.\nAside from the off-court drama, Jackson remains headstrong in his coaching tendencies. He often runs with five bench players at a time, and despite their excess of firepower, the Warriors have been middling offensively all year, no doubt thanks to some fallow, isolation-heavy play-calling.\nEven so, Jackson always seems to reach his players. Most of them have been forthcoming and outright in supporting him.\n\u201cI love Coach and everything he\u2019s about,\u201d Stephen Curry told reporters in March, per the Bay Area News Group's Marcus Thompson.\nCurry's support alone may be enough to keep Jackson in the Warriors' employ. He's the franchise cornerstone\u2014the superstar.\nIf the Warriors are committed to keeping him happy, then they'll just have to put up with whatever Jackson may or may not be endorsing away from the public eye."}

Syncrude Canada was fined $3 million when more than 1,600 ducks were killed in a pond in 2008 but no charges were laid in 2010 when 550 birds had to be destroyed due to an early winter storm that forced them to land on ponds at Syncrude and Suncor.\nIn August, Syncrude Canada was charged with failing to properly store a hazardous substance in connection with the 2015 deaths of 31 great blue herons at its oilsands mine, an incident not related to its tailings ponds.\n\u201cThis is a macabre version of Groundhog Day, where the government and industry keep promising that they\u2019ll do better while the birds keep dying in toxic lakes,\u201d said Greenpeace Canada energy strategist Keith Stewart.\nAlberta Energy spokesman Mike McKinnon said the government considers harm to wildlife by tailings ponds preventable and will carefully consider the AER\u2019s report to see if additional actions are needed to prevent future incidents.\n\u201cRegulations that increased oversight of tailings ponds were put in place in 2008 and improved in 2013 that included stronger wild life deterrent requirements,\u201d he said in an email.\nThe $17-billion Fort Hills oilsands project is expected to begin production later this year and ramp up to capacity of 194,000 barrels per day of bitumen within 12 months.

Edwards ''sold out'' the people of Louisiana for $1.9 million he received in a scheme to take over the state's program to certify hospitals, a Federal prosecutor charged here today in final arguments in Federal District Court.\nAssistant United States Attorney Marilyn G. Barnes, in closing arguments in the Governor's retrial on charges of racketeering and fraud, described for jurors the complex bureaucratic steps and business deals on which the Government's accusations were based.\nAt issue is whether Mr. Edwards and his four co-defendants conspired to manipulate for their own gain the state program that issues certificates approving construction of medical facilities.\nMr. Edwards, a Democrat now in his third term; his brother, Marion, and three other defendants are charged with racketeering and fraud. The first trial ended Dec. 18 in a mistrial. The jurors, leaning toward acquittal, deadlocked while trying to reach a unanimous verdict.\nLater, three other defendants in the case were acquitted by Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. for lack of sufficient evidence.\nThe Governor and the remaining defendants are accused of making a total of $10 million from the sale of five unbuilt and fraudulently approved hospital projects whose only assets were state approval certificates. The buyers were national hospital chains. A state-approved medical facility is entitled to Federal aid.\nThe hospital transactions were not merely shrewd business, Mrs. Barnes argued, but deals that took place in the framework of an illegal conspiracy, involving ''undue political favoritism,'' bribery and official acts for private gain.\nMrs. Barnes centered much of her argument on the moratorium the Governor called Aug. 1, 1984, on approvals for state medical facilities. The moratorium was called to allow the state to revise its health plan. At the time the Governor called the moratorium, he in effect exempted from it the applications for two large medical centers that had been proposed by two of his co-defendants.\nThe Governor listed the projects as nursing homes and said he was exempting them because legislators had complained that the state needed more nursing home beds. At the same time, Mrs. Barnes said, testimony had shown the state was oversupplied with hospital beds and occupancy rates had been dropping.\nMuch of Mrs. Barnes's arguments centered on a witness in the first trial who was not called to testify in the retrial. The witness, John Landry, named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, has been portrayed by the prosecution in both trials as a linchpin in the case. Prosecutors say Mr. Landry was bribed with the offer of a promotion in return for favoring hospital applications submitted by two of the defendants. But Mr. Landry's testimony proved inconclusive partly because he admitted lying under oath.\nThe Governor's retrial took an unexpected turn last week after prosecutors finished questioning the last of 31 witnesses and rested their case. Defense attorneys, scheduled Friday to begin questioning their first witnesses, rested their case without calling a single witness.\n''There's nothing at all we need to contradict,'' Mr. Edwards explained later at one of his frequent news conferences. He has consistently said the Government's case is purely political."}

But at what point do they stop being platforms for communication, and become the tools of hatred? And if they do become platforms for the likes of terrorists, are the networks themselves accountable? French President Francois Hollande has proposed legislation that would declare social networks \u201caccomplices\u201d if they do not block messages from extremists.\n[Social networks] can no longer close their eyes if they are considered accomplices of what they host. We must act at the European and international level to define a legal framework so that Internet platforms which manage social media be considered responsible, and that sanctions can be taken.\nAs of yet, no legislation has been drafted, but holding social networks to account for the activities of users could be problematic. As we\u2019ve seen with Reddit\u2019s r/guns board public anger doesn\u2019t necessarily institute change, and Reddit doesn\u2019t want to give private data to outside sources.\nWhen there is no impetus on the part of the social network to clamp down on otherwise legal behavior, forcing the removal of content can be difficult. However, there is evidence that terrorists are using social networks to further their aims. Networks can take down certain posts for violating the terms of service \u2014 graphic images, specifically threatening posts \u2014 but site wide policing is problematic at best.\nGovernments are quick to blame social media for its part in the proliferation of hate speech \u2014 and in some cases they\u2019re right to. France has stricter hate speech laws than the U.S., and after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo\u2019s offices, the police made 54 arrests related to statements made about the attacks. Some of these arrests were made as a result of social media posts.\nStill, there\u2019s some irony in the French government championing free speech, while arresting social media users, and calling for laws that would force social networks to do more to remove and block inflammatory postings. The issue of the accountability of social networks comes up time and again, and the current state of U.S. law seems to indicate that holding the social media companies responsible for third-party statements is impossible.\nPolice around the world can and have arrested suspects for their social network activity, but holding networks accountable for unremoved posts seems like an unenforceable law. That said, Twitter already removed more than 45,000 Isis related accounts during the latter part of 2014 of its own volition, so the proposed law might not be unworkable after all.\nImage courtesy of Frederic Legrand \u2013 COMEO / Shutterstock.com."}

The faster you treat the ink spot, the easier it is to remove; it may take a couple different methods to remove the ink completely.\nApply a white, non-gel toothpaste over the ink spot on any type of wall surface, using just enough toothpaste to cover the ink. After 10 minutes, wipe the toothpaste up with a slightly damp cloth, dabbing in the direction of the ink mark. Do not rub; rubbing may spread the stain and make the problem worse. For a large blotch such as an inky fingerprint, wipe from the outside of the spot toward the inside to keep the ink from spreading. Toothpaste contains gentle abrasives that help remove ink without damaging paint, paneling or wallpaper.\nIf the toothpaste doesn't remove the ink, rubbing alcohol most likely will. Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol, pressing most of the alcohol out onto a paper towel to prevent it from running. Dab and hold the swab over the ink areas until the ink transfers onto the swab.

Scott, and consultant Victoria J. Rideout are the authors behind \"The Digital Lives of African American Tweens, Teens, and Parents: Innovating and Learning with Technology.\" The study, released this month, is based on a national survey of more than 1,000 pairs of African-American teenagers and their parents, as well as focus groups. The emphasis was primarily on young people's use of computers and the internet outside of school.\nThe researchers found that young African-Americans are passionate about their smartphones. Eighty percent of survey respondents described them as \"very important\" to their everyday lives. \"It's their immediate connection to everyone and everything\u2014always on, always with them, and easy to use,\" the report says.\nBut when it comes to completing schoolwork or preparing college or job applications, young African-Americans reported strong preferences for computers over mobile devices, an important insight for school administrators weighing whether to buy laptops or tablets for their schools. And while more than three-fourths of survey respondents said they used a computer or mobile device to edit pictures and videos and watch online tutorials, fewer than 1 in 5 said the same about creating an app or website or writing computer code themselves.\nThe researchers attributed those disparities to a lack of exposure and opportunity, both inside and outside of school.\nAt home, they found, African-American children from low-income households, as well as those whose parents do not have a college degree, were less likely than their peers to report learning about computers from their friends or fathers. African-American parents also reported being far more likely to restrict computer and internet usage for girls compared with boys.\n\"What schools can take away from this is that African-American parents are very much engaged and concerned about their children,\" said Scott of Arizona State.\n\"But we know that [African-American] girls are not provided the same opportunities to play, to innovate, and to use computational thinking skills, and that may cause a problem.\"\nTakeaway: Young African-Americans frequently use technology to learn and create content, but far fewer write their own code.\nTakeaway: \"Young people\u2019s passion for their phones was obvious,\" the researchers conclude.\nTakeaway: African-American parents are substantially more likely to restrict girls' than boys' computer and internet use.\n\u201cHow Should Reading Be Taught in a Digital Era?,\u201d November 9, 2016.\n\u201cDo 'Digital Natives' Prefer Paper Books to E-Books?,\u201d November 9, 2016."}

The goal is to get new cyclists on the streets, though everyone is welcome to use the bikes.\n\"Bike share is really about those people who don't bike on a regular basis,\" Tony Powers, board member of the management authority, told Folsom's City Council on Tuesday night. \"It's a way to get some new people out there.\"\nAlbert Stricker, Rancho Cordova public works director, said his city and Folsom are ideally positioned to partner on this project because they're connected by the American River Parkway's popular bike path.\nThe LimeBike pilot will also help both cities figure out how to best serve their cycling populations through data, he said. LimeBike collects anonymous data on duration and where trips start and end, which can help city staff determine which roads need bike lanes and where to place bike racks.\nLimeBike's data helps the company's on-the-ground staff redistribute bikes to areas most in need, said Joe Gagliardi, president and CEO of the Greater Folsom Partnership. Initially, the bikes will be clustered around light-rail stations, major employers and downtown attractions.\n\"As they start to get more demand, they locate them where the highest demand is,\" he said. \"It's not one size fits all.\"\nDr. Anthony Retodo, medical services director for Kaiser Permanente's Folsom facility, was part of the task force assigned to choosing a bike share provider for the area. He said LimeBike was the only dockless option that had multiple gears, which he considers essential for people trying to get around Folsom's hills. They also offer an electric-assist bike option, which has a small motor that maintains speed when riders pedal slower.\n\"It was the friendly option in terms of gears,\" Retodo said. \"And they offered an electric bike option, which is important for some of our folks who have a fear of climbing up hills.\"\nAbout 20 percent of the bikes will be electric in Rancho Cordova and 30 percent in Folsom.\nIt's not LimeBike's first foray into the Sacramento region. Impatient with the progress of a regional bike share program, West Sacramento discussed bringing LimeBike to the city in March 2017. In the end, that pursuit pushed the Sacramento Area Council of Governments to finalize a contract with Social Bicycles, or SoBi.\nAt the time, West Sacramento was one of the first cities LimeBike was eyeing for a launch. However, after SACOG moved up the SoBi deployment, the green bikes never materialized on West Sacramento streets.\nSoBi launched a soft pilot last May in Sacramento, Davis and West Sacramento.

According the Harrell\u2019s peonage research, the aver-howed that there were more Black boys at the school than white boys. The school remained segregated until 1967.\nBetween the years 1903 and 1913, six legislative investigative committees were formed to investigate the school and found that children as young as five years were shackled with irons and chains, children were hired out for labor and unjustly beatings. In the early years of the school the boys were hired out to work along with the State of Florida convicts and forced to work with hardened criminals.\nThey were hired out to pick cotton on surrounding farms. In 1906, the school built a brick-making machine, which could produce 20,000 bricks per day. The students made enough bricks to sell to the residents of Marianna. Other produce and lumber was sold to people throughout the Marianna community.\nIn the year of 1966, the school made $127,030.30, from the boys\u2019 labor. The general farm produce report can be found in the Florida State Archives. Every division was reported monthly; dairy, poultry, produce, livestock, lumber and, swine can be found in these monthly reports. This is just two items pulled from the Farm Transfer and Sales Reports on February 1963; 10,300 feet of lumber sold for $669.50. From the poultry report, 3,180 dozen of eggs valued at $1,304.12 was sold. In 1966, the school made a total of $127,030.30.\nThe school\u2019s sawmill was capable of turning out 5,000 feet of lumber a day.

This original plan was concerned with keeping the commuter rail service on schedule with its electrification project; modernization would have changed the rail system cars to run on electricity instead of diesel.\nThe original Caltrain Business plan from spring 2017 was concerned primarily with the advancement of the rail system. In order to proceed with the project, Caltrain had to draft expenditure and expansion plans that would allow for improvements to facets such as train technology and terminals. According to the plan, modernization would provide opportunities for Caltrain to improve its services, increase the number of riders, and change its overall system.\nOne of the desired benefits listed in the business plan were lowered fares in conjunction with more riders.\nThe February meeting of the Joint Powers Board only approved the strategy and scope of the Caltrain Business Plan, not its total cost and expenditure plan. Before the plan is to be finalized, Caltrain noted that they would have to analyze demographics and travel patterns. Likewise, the company would also have to identify the effects of the rail system on local communities, specifically at places where the railway crosses through cities.\nWith the rail system company aiming to have the Caltrain Business Plan finished by the end of 2018, the electrification project itself is estimated to not have any electrical trains running until 2022."}

The existence of a tail fluke remains hypothetical.\nPaleontologists have discovered an ancient whale that had four legs, webbed feet, and small hooves on the tips of its fingers and toes.\nThe creature, named Peregocetus pacificus, had sharp teeth for hunting fish and could both walk on land and swim in the sea.\nA new study about this whale ancestor may force scientists to rethink how these creatures migrated 40 to 50 million years ago.\nAncient whales, the study authors suggest, crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa and swam to South America before traveling north.\nAt first glance, the four-legged creature above might seem like an otter or a platypus. But in fact, it's an ancient, 13-foot-long whale that lived 42.6 million years ago.\nIn a new study published in the journal Current Biology, paleontologists have documented their discovery of this whale ancestor, whose skeleton was unearthed in Peru in 2011.\nNamed Peregocetus pacificus, which means \"the traveling whale that reached the Pacific\" in Latin, this recent finding is upending scientists' understanding of how these creatures evolved and spread around the world millions of years ago.\n\"This is the first indisputable record of a quadrupedal whale skeleton for the whole Pacific Ocean,\" study co-author Olivier Lambert said in a press release.\nPeregocetus had four legs, with small hooves of the tips of its fingers and toes. That adaption, along with the orientation of its hip and leg bones, suggests this whale ancestor could maneuver on land.\nIts tail and webbed feet, however, indicate that Peregocetus could swim well, too, much in the same way modern-day otters do. So Lambert and his colleagues categorized the creature as amphibious (meaning it lived partially in water and partially on land).\nBut that doesn't mean the animal was good at walking, and \"certainly not at running,\" according to the Los Angeles Times. It likely ate in the water and only took to solid ground for activities like breeding and giving birth, Lambert told the LA Times.\nExcavation of the skeleton of Peregocetus in Playa Media Luna.\nPaleontologists uncovered the animal's bones just inland of Peru's western coast at a site called Playa Media Luna, a three-hour drive south of Lima.\nThey excavated the whale's tail vertebrae, jaw bones, some of its spine, and its front and hind limbs. The animal's skeleton suggests it was just over 13 feet long, and there's evidence it had a pronounced snout filled with sharp teeth for chomping on fish.\nPeregocetus' tail bones appear similar to those of beavers and otters, suggesting that the limb played a large role in swimming, the authors wrote. Unfortunately, the bones from the tip of Peregocetus' tail were missing, so the researchers weren't able to determine whether it had a well-developed tail fluke (like modern whales have) to help propel it through the water.\nThe left half of Peregocetus's left mandible.\nScientists agree that today's massive, flippered whales evolved from small,"}

You can't use it to pay your friends, however.\nEasy setup. Works at every credit card point of sale in the US and 17 other countries. Paying with a smartwatch is slick.\nBusy interface design. Uses legacy magnetic stripe technology. Paying with a phone can be awkward.\nSamsung Pay holds a place of distinction among mobile payment apps and services: It's the only one that lets you pay at conventional points of sale intended for cards that use magnetic stripes, which are still common in the US. Other countries have moved on to the more secure EMV chip card system, and the US is moving to it as well. You'll still find many retail outlets that only accept the old card system, however, including the many small shops that use Square terminals. Additionally, Samsung Pay offers support for NFC, loyalty plans, Visa Checkout online, and its own reward point system. All this adds up to a clear Editors' Choice for payment services.\nThe app and service work on most recent Samsung phone models, dating back to the Galaxy S6. In fact, it's preinstalled on many Samsung phones. I set it up on a Galaxy Note 8, which involved creating a Samsung account and PIN. Adding a credit or debit card starts with simply framing the card in the camera rectangle that appears when you choose to add a card and then entering the expiration date, CVV number, and ZIP code. Next, you agree to the usual verbose terms of service. I also had to call my bank to authorize the setup, but that varies depending on how your bank's security is set up; some simply require a text message or email verification.\nWhenever you use Samsung Pay, you get 5 Samsung Rewards points. For 2,000 points, you can get a $5 reward card, so it's an understatement to say that you need to use the service a lot to get anything worthwhile from it. Still, I haven't seen this perk in other payment apps, and if your linked card earns you points, you're pretty much double-dipping with Samsung Pay. I still think it would make more sense to award points as a percentage of the transaction's dollar amount rather than a flat five points per transaction."}

Officials also said last month that they had received no calls in the previous six months asking that power be restored.\nBut the Housing Authority memo indicates that Smith, with whom the fire victims were living, had twice sought help in getting power restored.\nThe power had been cut because of an unpaid Baltimore Gas & Electric bill .\nAs a result, the family resorted to using candles, which fire officials believe caused the fatal fire.\nLily-Bell Posley, 53, and her grandchildren, Marquan Williams, 6, Nyjerra McCray, 4, and Shydeim Scott, 2, died on June 10, the day of the fire. The children's mother, Latasha McCray, was not at home at the time of the fire. The grandmother was visiting from Pennsylvania.\nA funeral was held yesterday at the March Funeral Home East on North Avenue for the fire's fifth victim, Dominique Travis Derico, 10, who died Wednesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital from burns suffered in the fire.\nThe deaths produced outrage in the community because the family had been living without electricity for about a year. BGE said it cut power to the Amity Street house last July because of nonpayment of bills and it assumed that the same customer was still living there.\nOfficials said they have since learned that that customer moved. Smith moved into the home last July, and the family moved in with her about four months ago.\nIn a June 15 memo from the city Crisis Center to the Housing Authority, officials said that city officials had contacted BGE in July 1999, shortly after power was terminated, about Smith's account at the Amity Street address. BGE had replied that Smith needed to pay $1,266.59 to have power restored, according to the memo.\nCity officials arranged for Smith to pay $711, with the remaining money coming from the Baltimore Fuel Fund, which helps people in need pay utility bills, the memo said.\nSmith returned to the Crisis Center in March to seek assistance. This time, however, BGE informed city officials she needed $3,784.50 to have the power restored, the memo said.\nThe amount included $2,800 for three other unpaid bills - all under different names and addresses.\nAgain, city officials arranged to obtain $1,649.76 in public funds, leaving Smith with a $1,634 bill. Smith never returned, according to the memo.\n\"We are aware of the family's and Ms. Smith's repeated efforts to restore electricity,\" said William H. Murphy, an attorney retained by Smith and McCray, the children's mother. \"They have retained our services to obtain relief for damages the family suffered during the course of the fire.\"\nBrenda Pettigrew, a BGE spokeswoman, would not comment on a specific account, but said residents are not responsible for"}

His television talk show and newsletter were flourishing. His autobiography was selling at a record pace. And Americans across the country were gathering at ``Rush Rooms'' in restaurants to share the Limbaugh experience.\nHere in Washington, the Rush Room at Blackie's House of Beef closed three months ago - ``It was getting quiet,'' says a Blackie's employee - and radio listeners have declined in some major markets. But in other ways, the Limbaugh juggernaut rolls on. His radio show is now on 659 stations, 40 more than last year, and his TV show is now on 250 stations in the United States and Canada. Nationwide listenership is at 20 million weekly, says Kit Carson, Mr. Limbaugh's chief of staff. By comparison, conservative talker Pat Buchanan reaches 428,000 people a week and has just been canceled by WRC-AM radio here in Washington, a market no political talk show wants to miss.\nBut for Limbaugh, life on top has brought changes: To an increasing degree, he has to be careful about the truthfulness of his statements.\nMr. Harrison says the two forces Limbaugh has to be most careful of are himself and ``the liberals who have begun to coordinate their efforts to wage a public opinion war'' against him.\nFairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a liberal, New York-based media watchdog organization, hit pay dirt in June when it published a report detailing alleged factual errors and contradictory statements by Limbaugh on the air. Limbaugh, for example, had claimed that students at Chelsea Clinton's school were assigned an essay called ``Why I feel guilty being white.'' Limbaugh had claimed his source was CBS News, but CBS never reported on it. FAIR's objection was that Limbaugh reported a false story and misstated his source. The New Republic magazine also has published two articles since May alleging Limbaugh inaccuracies.\nThe allegations have reached mainstream consciousness. The Benchmark Company, a media research firm based in Austin, Texas, recently surveyed 538 talk-radio listeners across the country and found that 78 percent of respondents were aware of the so-called ``truth detector'' controversy. But 65 percent said it had not changed their opinions. Ten percent said their opinion had changed for the worse, and 3 percent said they thought better of him.\nOverall, Benchmark concluded that public opinion on Limbaugh was polarized. Sixty-five percent of respondents said he does not always tell the truth, while 28 percent said he always tells the truth.\nPerhaps as a reflection of this changing view, The Washington Post published last Sunday an anti-Limbaugh article by conservative commentator Cliff Kincaid, the biggest attack on Limbaugh from the right to date.\nMr. Kincaid questioned Limbaugh's credibility as a critic of Clinton on issues such as the Vietnam draft (Limbaugh managed to avoid it) and marriage (Limbaugh's on his third). He charged Limbaugh with manipulating the so-called Christian Right, moderating his tone (no more references to ``feminazis,'' for example), and consorting with the ``Hollywood Left'' he had railed against by appearing on the sitcom ``Hearts Afire,'' which is produced by friends"}

Usually the point is to keep the drivers safe or make racing more entertaining with evenly matched machines, but that doesn't mean the engineers like it.\nSo when Porsche gave its people the chance to break free and show what their machines can do, they overdelivered. They started with the 919 Hybrid, the car Porsche used to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans the past three years. Then they did everything that could make the car faster, the things that would break the rules for the rest of the time. They call the result the 919 Evo.\nAnd then they took it to Belgium's Spa Francorchamps, the legendary Formula 1 track that's home to what may be the toughest corner in motorsports. The Evo lapped the course in 1:41.77 minutes, 12 seconds faster than the race-legal 919. In a sport measured by the millisecond, that's a stupendous improvement. It even beat the all-time track record, set by Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, by 0.783 seconds.\nThe Evo carries the same two-liter, turbocharged V4 engine as the Le Mans-winning car, minus the fuel flow meter that limits how much gasoline goes kaboom.\nTurns out, when you get to ignore the rules that govern the World Endurance Championship (which includes Le Mans), there's a lot you can do to go faster. Porsche's engineers cut the weight of the carbon fiber and aluminum car by 86 pounds, to 1872 pounds, by dropping useless frills like the windshield wipers, lights, air conditioner, electronic race controls, and the pneumatic jack. They also tweaked the exterior aerodynamics, generating 53 percent more downforce, the all-important stuff that keeps the car stuck to the pavement when it's clocking jumbo jet takeoff speeds. They upgraded the suspension and tires to deal with the extra loads.\nThe Evo carries the same two-liter, turbocharged V4 engine as the Le Mans-winning car, minus the fuel flow meter that limits how much gasoline goes kaboom. Combined with a software tweak, that upped its output from 500 horsepower to 720 horsepower. The car uses two energy recovery systems, generating electricity from braking and the exhaust. That\u2019s stored in a liquid-cooled lithium ion battery, and then used to drive an electric motor on the front axle while the engine drives the rear, for maximum all-wheel-drive acceleration. Without imposed limits, that motor now adds another 440 horsepower (as much as the total power of a BMW M3), up 10 percent.\nThis record setting lap is part of a farewell tour for the Le Mans winning car.

While on-track wagering has declined for six straight years in the U.S., off-track betting has risen four years in a row.\nStill, the fallout from Santa Anita\u2019s recent fatalities, which included an abrupt track shutdown and some rapid-fire reforms, speaks to the sport\u2019s acute sense of crisis. Though Churchill Downs has rarely been the loudest voice on industry issues, befitting its corporate culture and shareholder sensitivities, it is poorly positioned to abdicate responsibility.\nChurchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said the track has responded to its recent run of catastrophic injuries by redoubling its efforts on areas within its control, specifically the racing surface itself. He said the track would soon announce \u201ca more formalized investigative process\u201d for racing fatalities, probably before the April 27 start of the spring meet.\nHorsemen sometimes contradict themselves on this score.

And don\u2019t underscore these qualities, for they were not very common back then. Though it might sound hilarious now but wearing baggy shirts and glow-in-the-dark bracelets were the \u2018Things\u2019 of the day.\nSadly, Gone are the days now. The rapid and peculiar evolution in trends and values has brought on a phenomenal change in the \u2018modern\u2019 teenagers. We may hold global progress or the aggressive media responsible for it, but it has definitely made the today\u2019s generation of teens at least appear to be more extraordinary than ever.\nToday a teenager is primarily \u2018cool\u2019, someone who is far more self-reliant, fiercely independent and way too autonomous than perhaps even more than the adults. However, whether this change is for good or for worse is still a big question mark.\nBeing a teenager in the 80\u2019s seemed a lot easier than today because of the world then offered greater security to the young, fragile minds and used to tame their personalities with care and tenderness. However, the vicious world of competition we are living in today has made growing up more of a hasty journey than a gradual process. With such rapid changes, teenagers do not want to be left behind to experience and want to have an immediate introduction to everything.\nHowever, Back in the 80\u2019s Teenagers were friendlier and less of a pain but today one has to have that X factor in him to hangout with them. For example, in order to be a part of a famous group (for girls especially) one has to have good looks, a great sense of dressing money to afford famous brands, a fancy Iphone and not to forget a heavy English \u2018accent\u2019.\nTeenagers today are blamed of lacking manner, but can we place all the blames on them alone? Back in 80\u2019s parents spent more time with their kids than just dedicating a couple of hours to them. They have time to talk, discipline them, and just be there for them in case they might need . Today\u2019s parents work all day long and don\u2019t even see their kids probably until the day\u2019s end, and so it\u2019s not strange that these kids are most likely to end up hanging out with people that can influence them in either way.\nIn 80\u2019s, teens were content with less. They didn\u2019t grow up in a world of high-tech, I-Pod, I-Tunes, Blackberry, Laptop and Hannah Montana. They were happy sporting and staying engaged in the after-school activities. They didn\u2019t mind working to earn themselves a car, if not necessarily a first hand. But the kids nowadays want everything fed to them in a golden spoon or else they would blame their parents. In the \u2018golden days\u2019, teens went to the library and manually looked for certain book as opposed to the kids of today who just log on to the internet, use CTRL C and CTRL V expertly to get their homework done.\nLack of communication and parental influence is the key reason why we are facing the current situation. And it is not just with teens, but today every next person wants an instant gratification and don\u2019t really want to put in handwork for it. Besides that, the media has significantly influenced teens in more ways than one. It has made them a little more rebellious, prone to experimentation, a lot more impulsive, and in great need of acceptance from their peers."}

Predictably, calls have gone out for the federal and provincial governments to step in. Some even suggest nationalization of intercity bus transit and outright purchase of the Churchill rail operation.\nSo, what should the government do?\nFirst, consider the rail line to Churchill. Canada has a storied history with railroads; much mythology attends the National Dream and the essential role played by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in building a nation.\nWhile Canada\u2019s first major infrastructure project was rife with scandal, what\u2019s relevant for understanding the current challenge is that upon its completion, the CPR encouraged entrepreneurs to engage in a frenzied expansion of branch lines to support a rapidly expanding Prairie population and to ship grain internationally. The result was an overbuilt rail network in which most branch lines quickly went bankrupt. In 1918, the federal government consolidated these failing railroads into a new government-owned entity \u2014 Canadian National Railway \u2014 that needed constant taxpayer subsidies.\nFinally, after an arduous two-decade period in which government allowed closure of money-losing branch lines, CNR became private in 1992. Management further eliminated staff overburden, minimized passenger service and focused on freight. We now have two privately owned and profitable rail companies that operate services continent-wide.\nRail excels at moving bulk freight. The rail line to Churchill had some rationale when Canada was making grain sales to Russia and Europe, but the grain market has shifted to Asia, and even if the government had not chopped the Canadian Wheat Board, there will never be enough bulk freight to support a viable railroad to Churchill.\nThis is hard for Churchill\u2019s residents, who have invested in businesses and homes with the expectation that the rail line will continue. Here is an idea: rather than putting some $43 million into the repair of a service that will certainly require ongoing public support, why not spend a fraction of that subsidy on the transportation of commodities by barge and air as well as compensating, at least partially, Churchill residents who wish to sell their homes and businesses? Such a plan must be time-limited, with the transport subsidy and offer to purchase expiring in three years.\nBusiness owners and residents who choose to stay in Churchill would make the calculation that they could operate profitably with the higher level of transportation costs reappearing after three years. Those who elected to leave would receive partial compensation for the losses. Most importantly, the public would dodge a perpetual subsidy and could direct their taxes elsewhere to support sustainable economic activity.\nTurning to Greyhound, the only mystery is why it took so long to make the final decision.\nDeclining revenue is the reason Greyhound cites for its decision to withdraw services in Western Canada. Indeed, according to Statistics Canada, intercity bus revenue has plummeted since 2010.\nNo, the answer is much simpler: the decline in ridership clearly indicates that rural residents prefer cars over buses. They are more convenient, at least for those who can afford to own their own vehicle. Unfortunately, this leaves some rural residents on the side of the road.\nThe demise of Greyhound service opens opportunities for alternative forms of rural transit. It is likely that ride-hailing will emerge as a"}

The Indians did not seem to have an answer to the duo as the Proteas threatened to take the game away from the visitors. But then, Smith fell trying to take a tight single, thanks to a stunning direct hit from Ajinkya Rahane.\nHasim Amla (4), the next man in, seemed to have been hounded by bad luck in the second inning too. He was bowled out in a bizarre fashion while trying to duck after misjudging the bounce on the pitch. Not rising as much as Amla expected it to, the ball crashed into the off stump.\nFaf du Plessis was playing unbeaten at 10 at the end of day\u2019s play.\nBefore they came out to bat, South Africa kept a tight grip on the match, with none of the Indian batsmen being able to cut loose on the fourth day.\nJacques Kallis bowled a fantastic spell of swing bowling to give the Proteas a crucial toehold. Kallis got rid of Cheteshwar Pujara (153) first, breaking a huge partnership of 222 between him and Virat Kohli (96) in the process.\nThe next wicket - that of Rohit Sharma (6) - was pure magic. The ball kept low, jagged wildly in and shattered the wickets.\nIn the next over, JP Duminy finally got a wicket when he snared Kohli four runs shy of his second ton in the match. Kohli was done in by extra bounce, edging the ball to the keeper.\nMS Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane then came together to try and stitch together a partnership. The two had put up 31 runs when Duminy struck again, making the Delhi lad edge one to Graeme Smith at first slip.\nAlmost right after lunch, R Ashwin drilled it straight to Faf du Plesis at cover, jeopardising the counterattack.\nDhoni tried to lead the charge and bring some aggression into his game but he fell cheap too. The skipper tried to hit a short delivery off Philander out of the park, but ended up sending the ball straight to deep point, departing for 29.\nThe Indian innings would have collapsed after Dhoni\u2019s dismissal but for a late flourish off the bat of Zaheer Khan. Khan batted fearlessly, taking on the pace of Dale Steyn and the rest of the Proteas bowling lineup, hitting the only two sixes of the match so far.\nInterestingly, Khan\u2019s cameo with the bat was not the only role reversal in the match. This match was the first Test where the wicket-keepers of both the teams bowled.\nAB de Villiers had the last over before tea on Thursday and on Friday, MS Dhoni took off his keeping gear with four overs left in the day. He bowled two of them. However, nothing dramatic happened in either.\nWith the cracks on the pitch getting bigger and the bounce increasingly becoming unpredictable, the last day of play will be interesting. Play"}

And in the opposite corner, there's the defending heavyweight Beats by Dre. Both have big names in hip hop backing them. But only one will come out victorious. We present: battle of the rapper headphones.\nAfter a deal with Sleek Audio went awry, Curtis Jackson made his dream of 50 Cent-branded headphones a reality by building it himself. His company SMS Audio acquired KonoAudio and proceeded to release STREET and SYNC by 50.\nThe wireless SYNC by 50 is one of the bulkier headphones I've used. I don't particularly care about headphone size, since bigger cans often mean bigger sound, but the reality is these over-ear headphones could be better built \u2014 not just for its hefty $400 price tag but at all price points. Instead of Bluetooth, the top-of-the-line SYNC model uses a wireless receiver, which to me puts it on the same level as computer mouse of a decade ago. When headphones and transmitter are in sync, a blue light on both devices blinks and illuminates the logo every couple of seconds. For me, this drew more attention than I'd like in a train, office and every setting in between.\nWith this dongle hooked up to a computer, phone or music device, I noticed a constant hiss upon first use, even during silence. Perhaps it was a flux, because eventually it disappeared. But the static noise combined with the hassle of using a wireless transmitter prompted me to listen using the included cable. Strangely enough, even though sound quality typically deteriorates with wireless connectivity, audio was noticeably duller when using the cable. In its unwired state, sound is full, slightly bassy. Depending on the song, you can occasionally feel the reverberation in these cans.\nBecause of its wire-free nature, all controls are on board. Power and sync are on the exterior of the left cup, and volume and skip/repeat are on the right. On-board controls are a common design in wireless headphones, but I still find them slightly confusing to use. But since the buttons are split up, they're easier to find than say Dre's model, where all the buttons are located on one cup.\nThese plastic headphones feel flimsy, like a mishap could easily snap them in half. The protective case is hard shell, but since SYNC by 50 isn't collapsible, be prepared for it to take a fair amount of real estate in your bag. Because of their unsecured fit, the cans themselves can't provide passive noise cancellation, despite what the product page claims. They sit loosely over the ears, which means when you're blasting Fiddy's music, everyone will know you're In Da Club. And no, there isn't active noise cancellation either.\nIs it worth the $399.95 price tag? Even if it were better built, used Bluetooth connectivity and fit more snugly, I'm inclined to say no.\nRead on to find out how Beats by Dre compare.\nBeats by Dre has taken on its own life. What started out as a pair of branded rapper headphones has grown to what might be classified as an audio empire. Not only is Beats creating similarly branded headphones for pop artists Lady Gaga, P. Diddy and Justin Bieber, but the well-recognized premium audio brand can"}

Random House. $29.95.\nThe title of David Halberstam's powerful new book, ''The Children,'' refers to the eight black college students who found themselves leading the new phase of the civil rights movement that began with the lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville in February 1960.\nMr. Halberstam had wanted to tell the story of the children since he covered the sit-ins on one of his first newspaper jobs, reporting for The Nashville Tennessean. ''I suppose I started work on this book some 43 years ago,'' he writes in a concluding note, which means he had the project in mind even as he wrote his first 14 books, the best known of which are ''The Best and the Brightest,'' about Vietnam; ''The Powers That Be,'' about the news media, and ''The Reckoning,'' about the automobile industry.\nThat he carried the story around with him so long seems reflected in the way his new book reads, with its driving novelistic narrative and its point of view so close to that of its heroes and heroines. The prose may be clunky at times (''He wanted to make even in smaller ways the city more complete''), but their adventures are told with such passionate conviction that the reader is transfixed. It is as if Mr. Halberstam had absorbed their history into his being and then poured it out as his own.\nWhat inspired him soon becomes evident. In one compelling vignette after another, he reveals how much the children had to overcome, not only in the violence of the white South, but also in both the fears of their parents and the indifference of the black bourgeoisie. Their persistence in the face of humiliation is admirable. Their sense of self-worth in the face of withering scorn is humbling. The commitment to Gandhian nonviolence brings tears to the eyes.\nYet Mr. Halberstam never huffs and puffs about these virtues. He simply piles detail upon detail, like the story of how Mr. Lawson as a boy was converted to nonviolence by his mother after he had slapped another child who had called him an ugly name. How Ms. Nash, during her first arrest, felt her fear turn into a growing anger. Or how it felt to several demonstrators to be beaten very nearly to death.\nThe accumulation of personal histories and anecdotes makes a very thick book seem short, particularly through the first two parts of what Mr. Halberstam has shaped as a three-act drama. Book I, ''The Children,'' tells the story of the Nashville sit-ins and ends with Ms. Nash successfully challenging Mayor Ben West to back desegregation of the lunch counters. Book II, ''The Valley of the Shadow of Death,'' tells of the Freedom Rides to desegregate interstate buses, and reaches a climax with President Lyndon B. Johnson's signing the Voting Rights Bill into law on Aug. 6, 1965.\nOnly in Book III, ''Coming Home,'' does the pace of the narrative begin to flag somewhat. This has more to do with the history of the civil rights movement than with any lack in Mr. Halberstam's storytelling skills. For once legislation was passed, the next steps in the attainment of a fully equal society lay beyond the scope of his narrative. Moreover, because the movement recognized how much more was still to be done, it began to break up into contending camps, with some in the movement growing impatient with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'"}
