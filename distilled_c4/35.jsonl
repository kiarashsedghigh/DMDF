Pinning such a case on some security and intelligence members will not satisfy us or the international community,\" he said.\nErdo\u011fan said the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body were still unknown and he demanded Saudi Arabia reveal the identity of a \"local cooperator\" who purportedly took the body.\nErdo\u011fan's speech coincided with the opening of an investment conference which Western political figures, leading international bankers and company executives have boycotted because of the furor around Khashoggi's death.\nThe Washington Post columnist, a sharp critic of the crown prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler, disappeared three weeks ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage.\nTurkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi agents.\nTurkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting the killing of the 59-year-old. Erdo\u011fan made no reference to any audio recording in his speech.\nRiyadh initially denied knowledge of his fate before saying he was killed in a fight in the consulate. That version of events was greeted skeptically by several Western governments, straining relations with the world's biggest oil exporter.\nErdo\u011fan said three operatives arrived in Istanbul the day before his killing on an apparent reconnaissance mission.\nThe next day 15 people came to the consulate. They included security, intelligence and forensic experts, and consulate personnel were given the day off.\n\"Why did these 15 people meet in Istanbul on the day of the murder? We are seeking answers to this. Who are these people receiving orders from?\" Erdo\u011fan said.\nFollowing the global outrage prompted by the writer's disappearance, US President Donald Trump's comments have varied from playing down Riyadh's role to warning of possible economic sanctions.\nTrump has also repeatedly highlighted the kingdom's importance as a US ally and said Prince Mohammed was a strong and passionate leader.\nTrump spoke with Prince Mohammed on Sunday. He told reporters on Monday that he had teams in Saudi Arabia and Turkey working on the case and would know more about it after they returned to Washington on Monday night or Tuesday.\nErdo\u011fan spoke as hundreds of bankers and company executives joined Saudi officials at a palatial Riyadh hotel for the Future Investment Initiative, an annual event designed to help attract billions of dollars of foreign capital as part of reforms to end Saudi dependence on oil exports.\nMore than two dozen high-level speakers have pulled out of the event following the outcry over Khashoggi's killing.

{"idx": "35002", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: New age shifting: is this really necessary?\nI\u2019ve driven a number of cars equipped with so-called \u201cautomatic clutch manual transmissions,\u201d in which the clutches are actuated by electronically controlled hydraulic devices - as opposed to the old fashioned foot pedal. Since the clutch is actuated by the car\u2019s computers the \u201cmanual\u201d shifting is controlled by steering wheel paddles or a shift lever, either of which simply supplies an electrical signal to the computer to move the gears up or down sequentially. In every case I\u2019ve experienced a lengthy time period between the disengagement of one gear and reengagement of the other - two seconds in the worst and not much quicker in the best of them. As far as I\u2019m concerned they take away the enjoyment of driving the car.\nThis type of transmission was popularized by Ferrari for use in racing, and in the hands of drivers like Michael Schumacher they work really well. Shifts can be made in as little as .15 seconds without the use of feet and shift levers, and that leaves the driver free to concentrate on getting around the track faster. Needless to say, Ferrari\u2019s transmissions are highly developed and certainly as expensive as entire high-end cars, so you won\u2019t find one in your VW, Mercedes-Benz or BMW very soon.\nWhat you will find is what I call \u201cWalter Mitty, Boy Racer\u201d transmissions because that\u2019s basically what they are. In their present form they aren\u2019t particularly efficient, have no advantages I can think of and are really annoying to operate - the mechanical equivalent of Windows Vista. What they don\u2019t do is allow you to drive the car from a stop to some desired speed with smoothness. Whether you take off slowly or stand on the throttle to get the maximum performance out of the car, the result is getting pressed against the seat followed by a second or two of \u201cweightlessness\u201d as the car stops accelerating and remains in limbo until the gear changes and the clutch reengages, followed by getting pressed in the seat again. This is supposed to be enjoyable?\nMaybe, for a few people, but I suspect that it\u2019s only enjoyable to those who really aren\u2019t very good at shifting gears or like to hear the engine get blipped up in revs as they touch the downshift paddle. I can\u2019t believe there are all that many mechanically challenged individuals who are willing to put up with the eccentricities of sequential manual gearboxes, though. Yeah, yeah, I know you can learn to anticipate the moment of shifting and let up on the gas and then press down again to better simulate a real gear change, but why should I do that? If I want to simulate a real gear change I\u2019ll buy a car with a clutch pedal and shift lever!\nA common argument I hear from enthusiasts is that the manufacturers have gone to these \u201chigh tech\u201d transmissions because they are better able to handle the higher power outputs of today\u2019s performance engines and conventional clutch/gearboxes. Oh, please! Clutches in World War II could handle 30-ton tanks, and today they can easily handle fully loaded 18-wheelers and 500 horsepower Vipers and Corvettes, so let\u2019s just call that argument what it is: silly and baseless.\nWhatever they might be called, sequential manual gearboxes are not technological breakthroughs - they are marketing breakthroughs. Normally I don\u2019t begrudge manufacturers for pandering to buyers\u2019 tastes and preferences, but when the alternative to the time-tested manual (clutch and gearshift) and today\u2019"}

Place a tee about 12 inches directly behind the hole. Now look at the tee, making a few practice strokes (keep looking at the hole while making these practice strokes), feeling the distance on how far you want the ball to roll with your eyes.\nThen setup to the ball look at the hole and slowly bring your eyes back to the ball, stop for a second and make your stroke.\nYou will find by doing this routine you will create better speed along with better distance control with more putts falling in.\nThis way when you play different course you will be able to adjust to various speeds.\nHave fun and enjoy the game.\nDaril Pacinella is the Director of Instruction at Turtle Creek Country Club in Rockledge.

The sign and the company had survived numerous fires.\nThe roof of Marcal Paper Mills caught fire.

The blaze took place at a two-story section of the Soundview facility, and was mostly confined to the roof, where it left a 40-by-40-foot hole, Pressler said.

They certainly don\u2019t lack bodies to sort through in the one spot on the field where the depth chart is the biggest question mark.\nWadley, who actually returned last fall and for four games was the team\u2019s best tailback before getting hurt again, is now a full go.\nTrayvon Hughes is back at tailback, his initial home, after a solid year at linebacker and, as often has been the case with him, looks good when he\u2019s healthy. He\u2019s healthy.\nJoshua Fields, an Americas alum who ended up being the team\u2019s leading rusher last year, isn\u2019t healthy yet, but he should be soon enough, certainly by fall.\nTK Powell and Ronald Awatt haven't seen much playing time but have shown potential in practice. Not much is expected of redshirt freshman walk-on Reynaldo Flores, an Ysleta alum, but he was a standout in Friday\u2019s scrimmage when he scored a touchdown.\nThat adds up to a lot to evaluate this spring, and as it hit its midpoint Wednesday, Dana Dimel likes the direction they are headed, even if he isn't sure yet where it's going to end up.\n\"There's a lot of competition,\" he said. \"They are all improving, we're working hard on the fundamentals of it. I've been happy with that. I think they are getting better on their pass protection skills, they are learning how to finish runs better. Ball security has been improving every day, they are catching the ball better out of the backfield.\n\"They are really rounding their game up in each area, I've been pleased with the progress so far.\"\nAs for the depth chart, \"Not yet,\" he said. \"That position is going to be a constant battle. There is a lot of talent there.\"\nThat crowd got bigger with the return of the junior Hughes. He seemed set up for a big freshman year as Jones' backup in 2015 but was hurt all year. He did miss 2016 with injury and was moved to linebacker in 2017. He would have been in contention to start there, but wanted back to his natural position.\n\"I was so used to tackling people, now I have to either make them miss or run them over,\" Hughes said. But \"this is where I've played all my like, it makes me happy to be back.

Armenians and many historians consider it to be genocide, but Turkey, successor of the Ottoman Empire, vehemently denies the claim.\nThe protests, which lasted ten days, culminated on Monday when Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who has ruled Armenia since 2008, announced his resignation, saying that he was \"wrong\" to reject the opposition's demands for him to step down.\nThe opposition insists that Sargsyan's resignation is just the first step in the political transition they were pushing for. They want acting Prime Minister Karen Karapetian, an ally of Sargsyan, to also step down after he and the opposition agree on the date of a snap election.\nWith a red rose in his hand, protest leader Pashinian led the procession to the memorial complex on Tuesday afternoon. His supporters were jubilant and anxious for the political transition.\nBut the opposition appears far from ready to form a united political force.\nThe coalition of the three parties leading the protest currently holds just 7 percent of the parliamentary seats and has not taken any stand on relations with Russia, Armenia's key ally and economic donor, or any other major political issue.\nPashinian, a 42-year-old former journalist who was elected into parliament in 2012 on an anti-corruption platform, garnered less than a quarter of the vote at last year's mayoral election in Yerevan. Pashinian has been mildly critical of Russia's presence in Armenia, but otherwise his political views are obscure.\n\"The opposition lacks a clear program of reforms, constructive agenda or clear demands,\" said Alexander Iskanderian, director of the Caucasus Institute in Yerevan. \"It's not that people took to the streets to support the opposition which has no clear structure or organization \u2014 they (did so to) protest against the corrupt government which became totally shameless.\"\nPashinian has so far not offered any plan or vision for Armenia other than calling for the snap parliamentary election and making sure that none of Sargsyan's allies remains in office, preventing the former prime minister from pulling the strings from behind the scenes.\nThe opposition will continue to rally until \"a full transfer of power\" happens and a \"people's candidate\" is elected prime minister, Pashinian said.\nThe protest leader, dressed in a camouflage T-shirt and a baseball cap, also told a news conference Tuesday evening that he expects the snap parliamentary election to be held in one or two months.\n\"We will ask people on the square about the prime minister and they will vote with their own voices,\" Pashinian said, adding that Armenia's electoral system needs to be cleansed to ensure a free election.

The DOE today offered Fremont, Calif.-based thin-film solar startup Solyndra a $535 million loan guarantee to help finance a new manufacturing plant for cylindrical solar panels in California. This is the first guarantee to get the green light in a much-delayed program created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Solyndra applied for the guarantee back in 2006.\nToday\u2019s announcement does not mean money in the bank for Solyndra just yet \u2014 the company still has to meet an equity commitment requirement for the DOE to finalize its guarantee. Still, having the feds on its side will drop many barriers to financing in today\u2019s tight markets. Solyndra expects the guaranteed loan to provide debt financing for some 73 percent of the costs for a photovoltaic solar panel factory producing up to 500 MW per year and employing about 1,000 people. As many as 3,000 people will find work building the plant.\nSolyndra is aiming for more than just lower-cost solar: The company says economies of scale created by this expansion will eventually translate to nothing less than grid parity.\nInteresting way to look at it. For the most part, I agree with you."}

The Los Angeles Galaxy found that out the hard way on Tuesday when they gave up two early goals to Tijuana and never recovered. On Wednesday, Sporting Kansas City learned the same, losing 5-2 to Cruz Azul on aggregate.\nTheir second leg with the Mexican side, which they entered with a hard-fought 1-0 lead from the home game, was not quite two minutes old when Ike Opara and Kevin Ellis let Mariano Pavone slip in between them and curl his shot around Eric Kronberg.\nIn the 24th minute, Cruz Azul\u2019s work seemed to be done. A second straight long ball found Marco Fabian over the top and this time the offside flag rightfully stayed down. His angled shot at Kronberg was saved by the goalkeeper, but he put it right in the path of the unmarked Pavone, who hammered it home for his second of the night.\nCruz Azul took control of a physical game. But in the 44th minute, out of nowhere, Sporting\u2019s Benny Feilhaber beat two men at the corner of the box, cut towards the middle and slid his shot past Jose Corona at the near post. If his goal had held up, it would have seen the Kansans through to the semifinals of the tournament.\nBut it proved to be an aberration. Sporting was lucky that it didn\u2019t concede a penalty in the final seconds of the first half, when Mecheak Jerome karate-kicked Fabian in the ribs while trying to clear a ball in his own box.\nEarly in the second half, Sergio Napoles hurtled up the left and squared for Pavone, who got away from the slipping Opara and finished cleanly. And the Mexicans would score twice more. In the 67th minute, the outstanding Fabian raced away from Jerome once more. His cut-back was hit at goal by Pavone but blocked on the line by Matt Besler. Nobody was there to stop Mauro Formica from slamming home the rebound, however.\nAnd three minutes later, Formica and Christian Gimenez combined beautifully down the center of the park in a give-and-go of headers which sent the latter through the back line. His fine finish made it 5-1.\nThe result was fair. Sporting had been outclassed and outlasted by a better-conditioned opponent. But their heavy loss, combined with the San Jose Earthquakes\u2019 defeat to Toluca on penalties earlier in the day \u2014 and the Galaxy\u2019s loss the evening prior \u2014 means that Major League Soccer will not be represented in the final four of this tournament.

Officers found five oxycodone pills during a subsequent search, police said.\nThe head of the most popular racing series in the U.S. spent the night in jail \u2014 a punch to the gut for a series reeling from slumping attendance and television ratings, and a decline in blockbuster sponsorship deals. France shifted the attention away from Elliott\u2019s victory, which signified a passing of the torch and a rare feel-good moment at a time of almost constant negativity in NASCAR .\nJim France, uncle to Brian France, has assumed the interim titles of Chairman and CEO and is assisted by Lesa France Kennedy, Brian\u2019s sister.\nBecause NASCAR is privately owned and run in large part by Brian France, Jim France and Lesa France Kennedy, there is no clear indication of how hands-on Brian France was or what kind of void his absence will create. The stakeholders are hopeful Jim France, the second son of NASCAR\u2019s founder, can be a steadying hand in trying times for the series.\nJim France and Lesa France Kennedy have always been in the mix of both NASCAR and International Speedway Corp., but the role of face of the family fell to Brian. He\u2019s the grandson of founder Bill France Sr. and replaced his father, Bill France Jr., as head of NASCAR in 2003.\nBrian France took charge during a time the sport was booming in popularity and sponsors were beating down the door to get their logos on a race car. Although many of Brian France\u2019s initiatives were progressive and needed in some form, staunch fans have vehemently rejected his vision.\nBrian France introduced a playoff system, overhauled the design of the series\u2019 cars and pushed for diversity within the circuit\u2019s predominantly white, male ranks.\nBut as viewership has declined, sponsors have pulled out of NASCAR and Brian France has not made himself available to the public. He appeared increasingly detached from NASCAR over the past several seasons and is rarely seen at a race. Aside from an occasional random call to SiriusXM NASCAR Radio, Brian France has said almost nothing about NASCAR\u2019s woes this season.\nHis lack of engagement created a logjam at the top of NASCAR. Chief Operating Officer Steve Phelps and executive vice president Steve O\u2019Donnell have tried to clean up NASCAR\u2019s mess, but they have been handcuffed like many NASCAR executives by an absence of leadership at the very top.

This bipartisan reform successfully reduced welfare rolls. On July 12th, President Obama quietly ended the work requirement, gutting welfare reform,\" says the narrator in the ad, which was announced Monday morning.\n\"One of the most respected newspapers in America called it 'nuts,' saying 'If you want to get more people to work, you don't loosen the requirements \u2013 you tighten them. Mitt Romney's plan for a stronger middle class will put work back in welfare,\" adds the narrator.\nThe newspaper touted in the spot is the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the primary daily newspaper for Virginia's capital city. Richmond is a major media market in the crucial battleground state.\nAn independent and non-partisan fact-checking organization, PolitiFact, rated one of the Romney campaign's earlier ad's claim on welfare as \"Pants on Fire.\" And the Obama campaign, the White House and former President Bill Clinton, who signed the original legislation into law, all attacked the earlier spots, saying the claims were false and misleading.\nThe Obama campaign responded Monday to the new commercial.\n\"Mitt Romney continues to run ads that independent news organizations, former President Clinton, and the Republican co-author of welfare reform have said are not true.

City plowing crews have been working all week to continue the process,\" LaGarce said. \"This impending new snowfall will be problematic on top of the recent storm, as well as the large snow piles already stacked along streetsides and intersections. A combined 20-22 inches of snow over a seven- to eight-day period is proving difficult and creating safety concerns.\"\nAccording to the city manager, city plow crews will continually clear streets using 12-hour alternating shifts.\nUnlike last weekend, when street department personnel had little assistance, this weekend a private contractor, Bleigh Construction, has been hired to assist the city with clearing streets.\n\"Bleigh Construction will be clearing major roads and arterials, while city teams will focus on residential neighborhoods,\" LaGarce said. \"By relegating arterial roads to Bleigh construction more effort can be placed in neighborhood areas and they can be cleared quicker. This is particularly important, because large snow piles and drifts already exist in neighborhoods from the last snow, requiring greater care when plowing roads, intersections and cul-de-sacs.\"\nTo help personnel who will be clearing Broadway, parking will be prohibited along it, from the floodwall to Maple Avenue, from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. on Saturday.\n\"This allows Broadway to be fully cleared for the public without having to navigate around parked cars and obstructions,\" LaGarce said.\nIn neighborhoods where on-street parking is normal, street department personnel will do the best they can to clear streets initially, according to LaGarce.\n\"City crews will clear as much of these roads as possible, but plow trucks cannot get too close to parked cars to avoid damaging them,\" he said. \"When residents go back to work early next week, city plow trucks will return to those neighborhoods and fully clear those roads curb to curb.\""}

Based on his prison sentence, Shmurda would have had to wait until 2022 for freedom, but it looks like his parole hearing could give him two extra years outside if all goes well.\nShmurda has been in prison since December 2014, while awaiting his murder conspiracy trial. Before getting up locked up, he received credit for 685 days in jail ahead of his sentencing. Adding that onto his served time equates to two years, which explains why he could be up for parole in 2020.\nHe needs to remain on good behavior until that time, which he has found difficult in the past due to 11 violations that include drug possession, fighting and possessing a shank.\nIf you recall, Shmurda was originally arrested back in 2014 along with multiple members of his GS9 crew at Quad Studios in NYC. Police discovered 21 weapons with Bobby being arrested on charges of conspiracy, reckless endangerment and weapons possession. When he later appeared in court, he was given even more charges, including additional conspiracy in the second degree, three counts of conspiracy in the third degree, reckless endangerment in the second degree, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.\nAfter two years of waiting behind bars for his trial, he was later sentenced to one-to-three years for conspiracy in the fourth degree and earned seven more years for criminal possession of a weapon in 2016 after accepting a plea deal. Last year, he was given four additional years for sneaking a shank into jail, but he is serving the time concurrently so it is not added to his original sentence.\nIf he is able to keep a clean slate for the next two years or so, Shmurda could be back in action in the music game going into 2021."}

Her lawyers reject Banier's allegations.\n\"She lent money with interest and it will be repaid, so it's not a payment,\" Jean Veil told reporters.\nThe allegations carry a maximum penalty of three years in jail and a 45,000 euro fine if the case goes to trial and she is convicted.\nBanier alleges that Claire Thibout, a former accountant to Bettencourt, received a loan in 300,000 euros in late 2012 and a gift of 400,000 euros for her false testimonies.\nMeyers-Bettencourt's lawyers say the loan was made to Thibout after Meyers-Bettencourt had dropped her complaint against Banier and that she therefore had no cause to bribe witnesses against him.\n\"The case was already closed at this point. It's absurd to think she could have bought off witnesses,\" said Veil.\nBanier was convicted of exploiting Bettencourt in 2015 and sentenced to three years in jail, fined 350,000 euros and ordered to pay 158 million euros in damages.

{"idx": "35051", "prompt": "Continue the following text: in past generations, air travel arrangements for the average vacationer were typically the province of travel agents. These professionals would arrange flights and travel packages, selling airline tickets with a markup to produce a profit. While travel agents still exist, more people set their own itinerary and purchase their own tickets online through the use of a technique known as ticketless air travel.\nTicketless air travel means you don't need an actual physical ticket, but you still have to reserve a seat on your flight. Go online to your airline's website or one of the flight aggregate sites such as Kayak, Expedia or Hotwire. Type your desired travel dates on the page and choose one of the flight options. Pay for the flight with a credit or debit card, and print out the confirmation page as proof of your purchase. Once you get to the airport on the designated travel day, use the same credit or debit card to check in and receive a boarding pass that will allow you to board the plane.\nYou are in complete control when you purchase your own tickets. With a travel agent, you can buy only the tickets she offers you, and she might not be as diligent as you are when searching for deals. You will save the cost of a travel agent's commission, so your flight will probably cost less. As long as you have your credit or debit card in your wallet, you don't have to worry about keeping tickets in a safe place or losing them.\nFinding the right bargain and flight can take quite a long time, unless you get lucky and find an acceptable match right away. It is difficult to get answers about flights if you have any questions, as airline websites might not have chat lines or phone numbers available 24 hours a day. If you are used to the old way of purchasing a ticket through a travel agent, it might be unsettling to depart for the airport without any visible proof of your purchase except a printed receipt. Travel agents might still have special deals available to them that the general public can't get, so you could miss out on a cheaper flight by going ticketless.\nPurchase your tickets as far ahead as possible to get the best choice of seats and flights, and the lowest price. Check more than one venue before purchasing your seat; reservations on the same flight can have different prices on different websites. Check in online 24 hours before your flight if possible, to get the best choice of seating."}

{"idx": "35054", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: America\u2019s Ballroom Challenge focuses on four divisions of competitive ballroom dancing. International Standard and American Smooth are roughly equivalent \u2013 both feature what we call the \u201ctraveling dances,\u201d in which the couples travel counterclockwise around the floor. The International Latin and American Rhythm dances, with two exceptions, are \u201cspot dances,\u201d that take place in one part of the dance floor.\nThe different divisions include many dances with the same names. But the same dance looks very different depending on the style in which it is danced. In the international style, dancers are in the closed position, pressed close together \u2013 this is classic ballroom dance, taught all over the world. The American style, however, allows dancers to open up \u2013 they can separate and use as much of the floor as they like \u2013 and is more theatrical, similar to the dances performed by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.\nPicture Fred and Ginger gliding across the screen, sometimes together, sometimes apart, but always in perfect time. This is American Smooth. Adapted in America from the traditional standard dances of Europe, American Smooth includes four dances that are also performed in the International Standard: waltz, tango, foxtrot and Viennese waltz. While the Standard dancers must remain in contact throughout, American Smooth couples are allowed to separate, and even perform solo moves, before rejoining. This \u201copen hold\u201d gives them more creative freedom and leads to a distinctly different kind of expression than is seen in the International Standard style.\nThe dances in the American Rhythm division consist of the cha-cha, rumba, swing, bolero and mambo. With the exception of swing, which started in America, these sultry dances originated in Africa and Cuba. The essential ingredient is the suggestive hip rotation, referred to as \u201cCuban motion.\u201d This is the only division in which the mambo, bolero and swing are danced competitively.\nWhen one conjures an image of ballroom dancing, International Standard is the style that most often comes to mind: sweeping ball gowns, men in tails and formal, regal dancing. With steps that date back hundreds of years to the royal courts of Europe, it is ballroom\u2019s oldest style, its most recognizable and, some would say, its most elegant. The competition includes five dances: waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, foxtrot and quickstep. All five must be danced in the \u201cclosed position,\u201d meaning that the man and woman must remain in contact at all times \u2013 in contrast to their American Smooth counterparts, who are allowed to separate and rejoin while performing many of the same steps.\nDancing doesn\u2019t get any hotter than International Latin. Dazzling footwork, provocative moves and skimpy costumes define this sizzling style. The couples perform five dances \u2013 cha-cha, samba, rumba, paso doble and jive \u2013 each one in its own way reflecting the timeless dance of seduction between a man and a woman. The fiercely competitive Latin couples attract the judges\u2019 attention with flamboyant hair and makeup, dazzling accessories, and costumes that leave just enough to the imagination.\nInterspersed throughout the professional competition on America\u2019s Ballroom Challenge are six pro-am exhibitions \u2013 two per hour. Each pro-am couple is a pairing of a professional teacher with an amateur student. These pro-am couples work just as hard as the professionals, spending countless hours rehearsing.

{"idx": "35060", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Communication is an essential component for meeting customer needs.\nFocusing on customer communication is important to the long-term success of any business. In the early stages of the relationship, effective communication ensures your product or service meets the customer's immediate needs. As time goes on, regular communication with your customer base allows you to adapt and grow so you can continue to meet its requirements.\nClarity of communication is important when attempting to understand what the customer truly needs. Attaining clarity often involves asking key questions to gain a better understanding of the customer's situation. Providing the customer with a clear understanding of what actions you intend to take the remedy the situation along with a specific time frame leaves little doubt in her mind of what to expect and eliminates confusion or misunderstandings.\nCommunication can serve as a valuable reinforcement tool to solidify the purchase. For example, a salesperson who stays in touch with a customer in the period immediately following the sale can reinforce the benefits of his product or service and how they meet the customer's needs. They can also quickly address any problems the customer may have, such as attempting to figure out how to use a new product. In the process, the salesperson can also lay the foundation for a long-term relationship leading to repeat sales.\nYour customers' requirements are likely to change over time, and the ability to communicate with them helps you adapt to their changing needs. If you're a distributor of goods, for instance, an increase in a customer's business may require a corresponding increase in the frequency of your deliveries. By maintaining regular communication with the customer, you are better prepared to provide the needed change in delivery schedule quickly and efficiently. In some cases, you may even be able to anticipate the customer's need for change and make helpful suggestions.\nFailure to communicate with customers for extended periods of can cause them to forget about you or make them think you no longer care about their business. When the time comes where they need your services again, they may decide to look to your competition instead. Even if a customer doesn't have a current need for what your business provides, the simple act of staying in touch with a newsletter, email or even the occasional in-person visit can reassure them you're still there to assist them whenever they need you.\nJoseph, Chris. \"Importance of Communicating and Meeting Customer Requirements.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-communicating-meeting-customer-requirements-11774.html.

Joint ventures will begin in September, the companies said.\nThe alliance makes Goodyear a $15 billion player in the $70 billion tire industry. More consolidation in the industry is expected as rivals try to protect their profits amid extra capacity and cheap imports from Asia and Latin America.\n\"With SRI's strength in Japan and Europe, and Goodyear's reputation in North America and Europe, the alliance will be a formidable player in the world tire industry,\" said Sumitomo Chairman Naoto Saito.\nSamir Gibara, Goodyear chairman and chief executive officer, said the alliance will help the companies compete and provide benefits to employees, customers, shareholders and suppliers.\nJapan's Bridgestone Corp. and France's Michelin SA have dominated the tire industry for nearly a decade.\nGoodyear has been the world's third-largest automobile tire maker, with about 17 percent of the global tire industry.

A study by Lookingglass turned up evidence of security problems in 100 percent of third-party providers.\nWith its thick walls, massive vaults, and in-house security detail, an old-fashioned bank building is the very picture of solidity. Online banks and financial institutions don't share this level of physical security. In fact, through connections with third-party partners the edges of such an institution can be tenuous indeed. At the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Lookingglass Cyber Solutions released a study that reveals a shocking lack of security among those third-party vendors.\nThis kind of problem has been in the news recently. The massive Black Friday data breach at Target, originally thought to be an \"inside job,\" turned out to have a third-party origin. Specifically, the attack came through Target's provider of HVAC services. The company's owner described it as \"a sophisticated cyber attack operation,\" but the data from Lookingglass suggests that sophistication isn't always needed.\nTo get the data for this study, Lookingglass tracked \"payment processors, auditors and other financial services within the financial industry supply chain.\" The study took place over a 35-day period in the fourth quarter of 2013, and found that 100 percent of the third-party networks \"showed either signs of compromise or increased risk.\"\nLookingglass researchers detected outbound botnet traffic and malicious network behavior in fully 75 percent of the third-party networks. That's pretty shocking. Worse, 25 percent of the total showed signs of infection by the Zeus banking Trojan. And some of these third parties themselves rely on other third parties, increasing the chance of a breach.\n\"This study highlights a weakness that the industry has been very hesitant to talk about in public\u2014the fact that trusted third parties should not and cannot be truly trusted,\" said Chris Coleman, CEO of Lookingglass. \"Global organizations ... must look beyond their own defensive perimeters and consider monitoring their public Internet presence to better understand their attack surface.\"\nThat good old-fashioned bank building has as few doors as possible, and every sturdy door is equipped with an alarm system and security cameras. For an online financial institution, every third-party connection is a door that just might let cyber-criminals slip in. Worse, it can be hard to even realize that such a portal exists. Who would have thought that Target's attackers could enter via the HVAC contractor? The full report goes into more detail, for those who are interested.\nThe lesson is clear. Your online institution is only as secure as its third-party providers, so you'll want to vet those providers thoroughly. Call for an audit, or use a service like Lookingglass that checks the security of \"a client's entire enterprise cyber ecosystem including the extended enterprise, and other networks beyond their control.\" Websites that correctly extend security to the very edge of their sphere of influence will be sitting pretty while their competitors suffer breach after breach.\nImage courtesy of Flickr user Lance Fisher."}

Tension between the two countries has been mounting recently, following visits by the Russian president and cabinet ministers to the islands and acrimonious statements from Japanese politicians.\nIn February, Tokyo celebrated the so-called day of Northern Territories \u2013 a term Japanese use to denote the islands. The two countries have not signed a formal peace treaty since WWII, after which the Soviet Union incorporated the islands. The Russian Foreign Ministry recently called on Tokyo to take a realistic approach to the problem and foster economic ties instead of politicizing the issue.\nOn Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also expressed concern over recent statements by US officials, who described the Kurils as Japan\u2019s territory. These assertions have no legal grounds whatsoever, he said.\nAccording to Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, Moscow is not planning to increase troops or change their structure on the islands.

The Mi-28N Night Hunter helicopters are intended to search for and destroy tanks, other armored hardware and low-speed aerial targets. Bastion mobile coastal rocket systems are equipped with the supersonic anti-ship winged missile, Yakhont.

Some think the answer lies in salad bars. Others have tried all organic programs. Still others have put their bets on school gardens.\nBut one little known program out of Minnesota starts by simply removing seven unwanted ingredients.\n\u201cWe have no artificial colors, no artificial sweeteners, no artificial preservatives, no trans fats or hydrogenated oils, no antibiotics or hormones in meats and no bleached flour,\u201d Jason Thunstrom said as he stood in the Jeans Elementary School lunchroom in West Suburban Willowbrook.\nThunstrom is President of the Life Time Fitness Foundation, which has provided 90 schools in four states with money to buy foods without the seven ingredients.

When he heard about what was served in most American lunchrooms, he initially considered buying up the lunch program.\n\u201cBut then reality set in, and he realized it would be an expensive proposition,\u201d Thunstrom remembered.\nSo instead of buying the whole program, Life Time decided to do an experiment\u2014to see what it would take to get those seven ingredients out of school food.\nThis first phase of the program involves serving better versions of lunchrooms standards like hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets and pizza. But Thunstrom says the longer term goal is to upgrade kitchens and support more cooking from scratch.\nTo this end, Life Time presented the school with a $10,000 check to upgrade its kitchen for more scratch cooking.\nStill, the endgame isn\u2019t to keep writing unlimited checks.

This includes \u201cspace storms\u201d in which high-energy particles can bombard satellites or spacecraft, causing serious damage. These particles are even referred to as \u201ckiller electrons\u201d because they can hamper navigation, communications, and weather monitoring satellites.\nNow a new study has found a way to predict the arrival of these killer electrons by one day, giving scientists and astronauts time to prepare for a space storm. This is particularly relevant for craft or satellites moving through the Van Allen belt, the doughnut-shaped radiation belts around Earth which are filled with energized protons and electrons trapped by Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. The belt starts at 8000 miles above the surface of the Earth and extends out beyond 30,000 miles from the surface. The particles in this belt can become even faster moving and more dangerous during space solar storms.\nThe predictions are based on a correlation between the movements of electrons in space and satellite measurements in low-Earth orbit. Chen and his team were able to find out which events would trigger a change in the rate of high-energy electrons and use this to build a model of space weather patterns.\nThe findings are published in the journal Space Weather.\nPoor indoor air quality can cause an array of health issues over time.

At about 6:05 a.m. EDT (1005 GMT) on Tuesday, the two space vehicles will be moving over western Panama.\nContinuing northeast over the Caribbean Sea, the station and shuttle will pass just east of Jamaica. For those lucky to be vacationing in Kingston, Atlantis will appear first, followed shortly after by the space station. They will appear over the south-southwest horizon at 5:05 a.m. local time and take about four minutes to move to the northeast.\nAbout minute after passing over Kingston, Atlantis and the station will sail over Windward Passage \u2014 a 50-mile (80-kilometer) strait between the easternmost region of Cuba and the northwest of Haiti.

From Key West and Miami, they will reach a maximum altitude of about 18 degrees and will take about minutes to skim across the sky from south-southeast to east-southeast.\nBut from Orlando, they will get only 12 degrees up and be in the sky for only two minutes.

No state that refused to expand Medicaid will save money, the researchers found.\nOn this Valentine\u2019s Day, as many as 4.4 million more Americans than on February 14 last year could go to the doctor to get the news.\nThat\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act provided them with health insurance. So they can afford to have a physician diagnose their lightheadedness or aching hearts.\nThe Republican response to that good news, as in the song made famous by Robert Palmer, is \u201cWHOOAAA.\u201d They want to stop it. They want to reverse, revoke, rescind, retract the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019ve tried it all. Nearly 50 times they voted to repeal the law that so far has given as many as 4.4 million more Americans health insurance in the past year and that will, over the next month or so, add a million more to that number. No pill\u2019s gonna cure Republicans\u2019 ill. They got a bad case of hating Barack Obama. So bad that they\u2019re intent on taking health insurance from millions of Americans in an attempt to wound the President.\nSo far, Republicans have failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But 21 GOP-controlled states rejected the Act\u2019s provision extending Medicaid to additional low-income people. They\u2019ve refused to expand Medicaid coverage, even though this will cost their states tens of billions in federal aid and will cost untold numbers of their citizens their lives.\nThe case of Israel Hilton is an example of the high price of hate. Hilton, 49, worked his whole life in customer service, a job he did well enough to earn an employee of the year award from K-Mart. But his employers didn\u2019t provide health insurance. He earned too little to buy it himself and too much to qualify for Medicaid in his home state of Texas.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Texas could extend Medicaid to cover the working poor like Hilton. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost for three years. After that, the feds would cover 90 percent. More than 1.5 million Texans would get health insurance. They could see doctors when they were ill. In addition, Texas taxpayers and premium payers would not subsidize so many costly emergency room visits by the uninsured.\nBut Texas Republicans refused the federal money. And so, in Texas, there will be more stories like Israel Hilton\u2019s. Last year, he suffered severe headaches and seizures. He went to an emergency room, a place that by federal law could not turn him away despite his lack of insurance. It\u2019s not a place, however, most appropriate for determining the cause of seizures, and he was misdiagnosed. Without health insurance, he didn\u2019t seek a second opinion. By the time he returned to the hospital and received the correct diagnosis of brain cancer, it was terminal.\nA study released last month shows what each state will lose in federal funding by rejecting the Medicaid expansion. Texas will forgo the most, according to the researchers at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, about $9.2 billion in 2022.\nNo state that refused to expand Medicaid will save money, the researchers found. In addition, the study noted, residents of states like Texas will subsidize with their federal tax dollars the services provided in other states"}

In one of the sessions, we focused on a topic that I have constantly spoken of and kept an eye on. While we think the more we explain ourselves, the better people understand us, there\u2019s a very thin line between over explaining, being apologetic and getting people to see our point of view.\nI once read that as women, because our personality revolves around being generous with our time and energy, we want everyone to walk our journey with us. In the same way, we do not want to say anything that can be misconstrued or leave people wondering about the essence of our communication. This, then, pushes us to over communicate which is even more destructive than communicating too little. On the other end, most men communicate with brevity and assume that whoever leave behind will catch up.\nWe are all guilty of doing this at some point. We receive an email or text message from a friend. Despite the fact that it\u2019s ten or less words long, we read about ten pages into the nuances that we are sure are underlying it. We over analyse what the other person could have meant, the subtext, potential but nonexistent emotional undercurrents. And this unfortunately, does not change within the work environment. As a result we go along life with all this communication \u2018she/he said this but they could have meant that\u2019 baggage that drags us down and keep us from focusing on the more important things.\nMy coach pointed out that for clarity of communication we need a two pronged approach. The first is to be comfortable with silence. Say you ask for a raise at work. Your boss is quiet so you feel the need to fill that silence with apologies or ramble along about your reasons and start the whole cycle of self-doubt and beating yourself up. Get used to making a request and then staying quiet until you\u2019re asked a direct question. The second is to not make up stories about communication directed at us. If someone says they cannot meet, resist the urge to decipher it as they do not like us or some other similar thing."}

The United States, on the other hand, at least in terms of paid family leave, may be the worst in the developed world.\n\"Here, it's not about work,\" says the 33-year-old Reid, looking out on the wintry sunset from his home on the island of Styrs\u00f6. \"It's about enjoying life.\"\nFor every child they have, Swedish parents are legally entitled to share 480 days off from work. During this break they are paid 80 percent of their salaries in the first 390 days and the equivalent of around $20 a day per parent thereafter.\nBut what really sets Sweden apart is its commitment to gender equality.\nThree months of the 480 days must be taken by fathers. Last year Swedish dads took more than 27 percent of the total leave allotted to couples nationwide.\nThis cultural shift has become so ingrained in society that it is now frowned upon for new fathers not to take extended periods of time off. Areas of Stockholm are now rife with \"latte dads\" \u2014 typically youngish, bearded men carrying their babies in slings or hanging out with their toddlers.\nBut for the Swedish government, that's not enough.\nThe ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition is now pushing for fathers to take 50 percent of their share in paternal leave \u2014 \"pappaledighet\" in Swedish. This means they would spend as much time with their young children as moms, and get paid doing it.\n\"We say that we have the most progressive system in the world, but how do we also continue to be a forerunner in equality within our system?\" says Victor Harju, a spokesman for Sweden's Ministry for Social Affairs and Health.\nThe comparison with the U.S. could not be more stark.\nAmericans are the only people in the developed world whose central government provides no paid family leave at all \u2014 for mothers or fathers.\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act, signed by President Bill Clinton 25 years ago in February, means some mothers are entitled to 12 weeks off after childbirth. But this is unpaid, and many people don't qualify, particularly if they work for companies with 50 employees or fewer.\n\"I would come home and see my son for 30 minutes a day and then I'd be gone in the morning before he'd wake up.\"\nSome American women do get benefits, of course, but it's up to individual states and private companies to make up the shortfall.\nThis legal and cultural divide is what, along with extraordinary luck and privilege, drew Reid and his family to Sweden.\nReid's wife, Agnes Asplund, 34, is Swedish. Before they moved in summer 2015, her father had just built a house on Styrs\u00f6, a craggy island in the Gothenburg archipelago, and asked if they wanted to live in it.\nAt the time, the couple were living in New York City.

That event distributed more than $500,000 of new military clothing and civilian clothing, goods and services and administered 300 flu shots to veterans.\nIn 2002 they opened the Veterans Food Pantry and an outlet for clothing. They moved into their current facility at 1349 U.S. 2 E. in Evergreen in 2010, quadrupling their space to 11,000 square feet, allowing for more services to veterans.\nThe nomination letter pointed out how the Ericksons have grown the Veterans Food Pantry from using a single van to distribute loads of potatoes to what it is today \u2014 a nonprofit with an average annual revenue of $750,000 that helps thousands of veterans each year.\nThe Ericksons also created a veterans service center that provides shelter, meals, clothing, blankets, food baskets, medical attention, monthly haircuts, access to the internet and peer counseling. Their Veterans Clothing & More store is open to the public. Donated clothing and furniture are used to help homeless veterans. They also provide monthly food boxes to qualifying veterans and their families and additional holiday food boxes.\nAnd finally, they created the Durable Medical Equipment Loan Program that provides low-income, at-risk individuals with medical equipment. It also provides short-term equipment loans allowing individuals to purchase equipment at discounted prices, which improves quality of life while saving hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars.\nOther awards presented by the Evergreen Chamber of Commerce included the Energizer Bunny Award, which went to Julita Ward for her active involvement with the Chamber.\n\u201cSprucing Up Evergreen\u201d awards went to Mitch\u2019s Autowerx for its recent remodeling project; the Evergreen School District for its logo display on the school fence and new pavilion; and Jeff Brown of The Hardware Store and Keith McAtee from Grime to Shine for helping the Chamber re-stain its Information Center."}

That post-Inauguration rally saw millions of people from countries around the world take to the streets to protest the sexism, racism, and xenophobia bolstered by Trump\u2019s election.\nIn the United States, events are being planned by the organizers of the Women's March under the title, \u201cPower to the Polls,\u201d with a focus on getting more women into elected office and more people voting in general.\nFor all the apparent unity and motivation drummed up by the Women\u2019s March, what progress\u2014especially on the theme of reproductive justice\u2014can we look to as a sign of the power of mass action?\nLast year was certainly a mixed bag in regards to reproductive rights, but there were gains: 2017 saw a surge in the number of pro-choice bills introduced and even passed at the state level. Some 645 bills were introduced to protect access to reproductive health care, either by introducing new protections or reforming laws that criminalize abortion care. Of those, eighty-six were passed into law, according to a report from the National Institute for Reproductive Health. These numbers represents major increases in pro-choice measures considered in state legislatures: 191 such bills were introduced in 2016.\nLast year was certainly a mixed bag in regards to reproductive rights, but there were gains.\nPart of the focus has been to get pre-Roe v. Wade laws that criminalize abortion off the books, a critical move if that landmark ruling is overturned by a future Supreme Court decision. According to the Guttmacher Institute, eighteen states still have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion if that happens, including ten states that have retained unenforced, pre-Roe abortion bans. In one somewhat surprising recent victory, the Republican Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that expanded insurance coverage of abortion care for people with low incomes and repealed a law that would outlaw the medical procedure if Roe were to be overturned. Anti-abortion groups attempted to sue to block it from being implemented, but a judge denied the request.\nSadly, efforts to strip away reproductive rights continue unabated. In several states, so-called \u201ctrigger laws\u201d have been passed that would automatically criminalize abortion if Roe were overturned.\nPlanned Parenthood, the largest single provider of reproductive health care in the country, faced constant attacks. As a congressman in Indiana, Mike Pence introduced legislation in 2009 and 2015 to strip the organization of all federal funding, claiming that, despite a long-standing ban on federal funds being used for abortion services, any money going to the group was suspect.\nThat attitude persists, with the result that abortion foes have successfully ended state funding for the organization, causing the closure of several clinics (even those that didn\u2019t provide abortion services). In Wisconsin, for instance, Planned Parenthood was forced to close five rural family planning health centers after Republican Governor Scott Walker stripped them of state funding.\nOpponents of Planned Parenthood have claimed that other health centers will fill in the gap in reproductive health coverage.

The city is a six-hour drive away from Davao City, and three-hour drive away from either General Santos City or Cotabato City.\nThe Baras site, which is home to more than 20,000 birds, was declared a bird sanctuary in 2002 by the city government.

Unfortunately, there are many exceptions, so many that the rule should be: Often cover an honor with an honor. Which does not help much.\nA common group of exceptions, to which there are also exceptions, arise when dummy leads from a sequence. It is usually wrong to cover until the last sequential card is led. But if the sequence is in the closed hand, it is not visible. It can often be inferred, as on the diagramed deal from the North American Swiss Team Championship in St. Louis in November. In this case, the reason for not covering was far from obvious.\nNorth-South used a traditional sequence to reach four spades, starting with a two-heart response to one spade. Many modern experts treat the two-heart response as game-forcing, for which the North hand would not qualify. This method runs the risk of missing a heart fit when the responder has only about 10 points.\nWest led a trump, which was a good start to the defense. South won with the ace in dummy, led the club jack and finessed. West won the queen and played a second spade, won in the closed hand. Now the moment of truth was reached when the club king was led.\nWest routinely covered with the ace, and dummy ruffed. South led a diamond to the 10, losing to the king, and was in full control. West returned a club, and South won with the 10. He then drew the two missing trumps and the heart ace was the third and last trick for the defense.\nIn the replay, North responded one no-trump, forcing in the modern style, but the final contract was the same. The play to the first three tricks was identical, and again South led the club king. The West player, Michael Einberg of Los Angeles, reasoned that South would not play in this way unless he held the 10, so he ducked.\nSouth discarded a heart from dummy and was able to ruff the club 10, but he was now unable to keep control. He led a heart to the queen, losing to the ace, and was forced to ruff a club lead. He could and did draw the last trump but had only nine tricks. Einberg was sitting with the diamond king and a winning club. Starting diamonds before hearts would not have helped the declarer.\nThe effect of the refusal to cover was that South had to score his club trick before it was convenient.

But not many can figure out the relationship between Newt Gingrich, conservative bomb thrower, and Richard G. Darman, Machiavellian budget maker.\nOver the last month the two men have engaged in a public duel that included speeches, philosophical debate, subtle and not so subtle digs, even an ultimatum. At the same time, privately, they keep talking -- and talking and talking, 10 to 12 hours in a variety of settings over the past three weeks, said one Republican close to Mr. Gingrich.\nBurton Pines, a senior official at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative study group, struggled to explain the two men in a recent interview and then sighed, saying it was, perhaps, a task better suited to his wife, a psychotherapist. But there is more at work here than id and ego, although there is probably plenty of that.\n\"I think it's partly about real issues, it's partly psychodrama, and it's partly posturing,\" said one senior Administration official.\nLike many great political spats, it all began with a speech. This one was delivered by Mr. Darman, the White House budget director, and grandly titled, \"Neo-Neo-Ism: Reflections on Hubble-ism, Rationalism and the Pursuit of Excellence (After the Fiscal Follies).\"\nSome say the talk was intended to be lighthearted, a whimsical trip through domestic policy and the fads that often sweep it. But there is little room for whimsy among Republicans these days, riven as they are between right and left, old imperatives and new paradigms. Mr. Darman's speech, to the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonpartisan organization of former senior Government officials, was taken very seriously by some conservatives, a slap by the dark prince of establishment Republicanism at their search for new ideas.\nMr. Gingrich, the House Republican whip, was coming off a harrowing autumn, having broken bitterly with the White House over the budget negotiations and having endured a humiliatingly close re-election race in his district in the Atlanta suburbs. But being Newt Gingrich, a man whose political passions are in a permanent state of arousal, he had room for another fight left in him.\nMr. Gingrich said his initial reaction was that the Darman speech was sad, an exercise in \"preppy humor\" and -- most insulting of all in Washington policy circles -- \"not very important in and of itself.\" But in the days that followed, the Georgia Republican decided that Mr. Darman was trying to take on the conservatives and their search for a new domestic policy.\nSo Mr. Gingrich delivered a public ultimatum to the budget director: Recant or resign. Mr. Darman, to whom the word arrogant is assigned as often as hothead is to Mr. Gingrich, did neither, and Washington braced itself for the mighty clash of two formidable egos.\nInstead, the two men began to talk.\nThe Darman-Gingrich tension is just part of the broader battle for the soul of the Republican Party. The struggle over the budget last fall reflected these passions: Many Republicans found the Administration's acceptance of higher taxes a stunning repudiation of not only the economic orthodoxy of the party but also of a successful political formula, a victory for the accommodationist wing of the party.\nMr"}

In this, I have poured over translations of ancient texts on alchemy and meditation, the classics of Lao-Tzu, Chuang-Tzu and modern scholars such as Eva Wong and Thomas Cleary, and esotericists including Benebel Wen.\nOne area of particular personal interest in my search for the supreme energy system is the Microcosmic Orbit, an internal technique of alchemy and energy circulation. I was delighted to find this technique crop up in Aiden Wachter\u2019s fantastic book, Six Ways: Approaches and Entries for Practical Magic. It is noteworthy that Aiden acquired the technique from Jason Miller, who himself has advocated for eastern energy circulation systems over western models, such as the Middle Pillar, on grounds of effectiveness. Indeed, Miller notes the post Victorian tendency to romanticise eastern wisdom that trickled through and attempt to locate its western alternative, forcing everything to fit the convenient Tree of Life schema. In terms of energy circulations, I agree with Miller that this correlation and attempt was awkward in western modern renditions and best abandoned (attempts at correlating chakras with sephiroth has proven tiresome and an irregular fit). Rather, in taking the esoteric philosophies of the East and trying to shoehorn them into a Western tradition, there has been a neglect of those traditions which are most effective, thereby chucking the baby out with the bath water.\nThere is a case to be made that, as I am culturally removed by way of my European heritage from ancient Chinese shaman and Taoists, I am guilty of appropriation. There exists, nevertheless, some remarkable cross over. Besides which, it is not my intention here to argue for Chinese philosophy brewing in the ancient cultural milieu, nor the importance of transmission of ideas, goods and wisdom via the Silk Road; that\u2019s better left to more clever people and different times. There is, however, something hauntingly familiar in the Proto-Taoist dances from China.\nYu the Great is credited in some ancient cosmologies as being an ancestor of some antiquity and reverence. Yu the Great predates the earliest written records in China and his name is found inscribed as far back as circa 1045 BCE . Credited with bringing order out of chaos, the cosmic waters of flood were managed by Yu the Great and used to found the communities to whom he is a demiurgic figure. In the process of drawing order from the chaos of the abyss, Yu became lame on one side, thus explaining the shuffling step used in the mystic dance of early Taoist shaman-priests, which imitates Yu as he traverses the heavens, circling in a spiral about the celestial pole and then treading the nine (seven visible, two unseen) stars of the Big Dipper upon the North Star Road. In this mystic dance, we can perceive an origin for later martial arts forms and qigong methods for health and vitality. Indeed, the importance of the Big Dipper to early Taoist mystics cannot be overemphasised, taking paramount importance in the heavenly journey of the proto-priest.\nThe Big Dipper, or as it is known in Chinese, The Seven Stars"}

Signing some urgent papers prepared by the private office, the Prime Minister decides to call it a night quite early for once: to go upstairs, see his wife, play with the kids, and relax a little. It is a day of celebration, after all. And his mind is moving at light speed as he wonders what he shall do with his mandate: his mandate.\nThe best thing about that mandate, of course, is that it was unexpected \u2013 or, more precisely, unexpected by the media. Though he faced the general election as incumbent, he was always the underdog, always the one with something to prove. And now he has proved it: the Rt Hon Gordon Brown, Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, in command, at last, of his own Commons majority, not a hand-me-down from his predecessor, and \u2013 for the first time since Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1994 \u2013 unambiguously his own man. The Age of Gordon, he muses, starts today and will last till 2014 or 2015\u2026 maybe longer! The famous clunking fist curls and uncurls in reflexive pleasure.\nEarlier, as he called in Peter Mandelson and told him that he was to be Foreign Secretary at last \u2013 the first member of the House of Lords to hold the post since Lord Carrington \u2013 his deadly-rival-turned-closest-ally shed a tear in memory of his grandfather, Herbert Morrison, who held the same post all-too-briefly in 1951. Composing himself, Peter had asked when he knew they had won. Certainly, the news about Worcester in the early hours of that very morning had been an electrifying moment. The Tories badly needed to win this Midlands seat, and scores of others like it. But, on the night, Labour's Michael Foster had held on. True, his majority was reduced from 3,144 to 1,456. But a win was a win. That, said Peter, was \"surely the equivalent of Basildon for John Major in 1992\". Gordon shook his head. He had known \"he was going to crush that snooty little PR man\" Cameron in the week of the Budget.\nNow Mandelson understood what he was driving at. In that March week, the Cameroons had seemed finally to forget the themes that had made them so deadly in 2005 \u2013 the promise of change, and their mantra that things could be so much better. Oh, Cameron had still spoken in the campaign about his New Jerusalem For All, and the opening of a fresh chapter in \"our great island story\". But by then the Tories had come to believe that the route to power was to list in ever-greater detail what they were going to cut, confusing \"honesty\" with clarity of purpose. The most successful broadcasts of the campaign had shown Gordon standing in front of a hospital, or school, or similar beloved civic institution (always in a marginal seat, of course) and saying: \"My values \u2013 my moral compass \u2013 tell me that it is right that this hospital/school/University of Joe Strummer continues to do its work. Can you be sure that David Cameron agrees?\" Mandelson smirked in pleasurable memory.\nNow, of course, Gordon would have to shift the goalposts.

{"idx": "35128", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Turkey\u2019s June 24 elections ushered in a new constitutional order with significant ramifications for the country\u2019s international role. Recep Tayyip Erdogan became Turkey\u2019s first popularly elected executive president with 53 percent of the national vote. He will enjoy a range of unalloyed executive prerogatives with full and exclusive responsibility for policymaking. He will be responsible for the conduct of foreign policy as well, unlike in the previous system, where the now vanished office of the prime minister had been entrusted with executive authority.\nThis systemic transformation will have a huge impact on the conduct of foreign policy. For many years, Turkey\u2019s highly regarded foreign service was composed exclusively of career diplomats who charted and guided the implementation Turkey\u2019s foreign policy. The Foreign Ministry was thus seen as one of the three key pillars of the Turkish state along with the military and the Finance Ministry \u2014 institutions distinguished by their allegiance to the nation rather than the ruling party. Since the beginning of Erdogan\u2019s first presidential term in 2014, the Foreign Ministry gradually lost its influence to the benefit of the executive branch. The foreign service also witnessed a growing number of political appointees. Today, 10 percent of Turkey\u2019s ambassador-level representatives in 151 missions are noncareer diplomats.\nThis trend will accelerate with the transition to a presidential system. The Turkish diplomatic corps is likely to be remodeled along the lines of the U.S. system, with a combination of political appointments and career officers. This redesign of public administration will also replace the top bureaucratic position of the permanent undersecretary in all ministries with politically appointed deputy ministers. One key and near-term challenge for Turkish diplomacy will therefore be the shaping of a new institutional culture that can manage this process of politicization within the diplomatic ranks without endangering the foreign service\u2019s integrity and performance.\nIn addition to this structural transformation, Turkish foreign policy will also be affected by another electoral consequence: The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost its outright parliamentary majority. Even with its diminished role under the new constitution, the control of parliament is critical for the effective functioning of the political system.\nThe AKP\u2019s new ally in parliament will be its elections partner, the ultranationalist National Movement Party (MHP). But this alliance will not be restricted to parliamentary affairs. The MHP will leverage its position as kingmaker and seek influence over all policymaking. This tacit alliance with the MHP will create a new set of difficulties for Erdogan in foreign policy.\nThe MHP is defined by its heavy focus on Turkish nationalism. At home, its agenda prioritizes national security concerns over personal freedoms. The party has opposed lifting the state of emergency in place since the July 2016 failed coup (although recent reports suggest that Erdogan may be planning to lift it). The MHP also champions a heavy-handed approach to the Kurdish problem. For the MHP leadership, democratic freedoms can easily be sacrificed for law and order. Its worldview is a Hobbesian one, and it is informed by a firm belief that Turkey has no friends at the international level.\nThe MHP\u2019s deep suspicion of internationalism is bolstered by a siege mentality that regards Turkey\u2019s national interests as constantly under threat by foreign actors. Unlike the AKP, which traces its roots to political Islam and essentially views the West as the ideological other, the MHP vision is less discriminatory. It nurtures an equal disdain for all foreigners. Erdogan\u2019s necessary partnership with the MHP will therefore open Turkish"}

{"idx": "35135", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Not long ago, I examined an otherwise healthy and active retiree in his 50s with newly diagnosed metastatic lung cancer. He had no heart disease, no kidney disease, no liver disease. He came to my practice at UT Southwestern Medical Center specifically for clinical trial options.\nDisappointingly, one detail in his medical history excluded him from all of our available trials. Four years earlier, he had been treated for stage 1 prostate cancer, a disease so prevalent and nonaggressive that the U.S. government no longer recommends routine screening for it. I couldn't think of a single way in which the patient's prior experience with cancer would interfere with treatments or assessments on a lung cancer trial. And yet I couldn't enroll him.\nUnfortunately, many sick patients are being denied the opportunity to test new drugs that might save their lives. It's time for this to change.\nThe criteria that determines who can participate in clinical trials continues to grow more complex despite repeated calls to simplify them. A study conducted last year at UT Southwestern found that over the past 30 years the average number of eligibility criteria in lung cancer trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute grew by 50 percent to an average of more than 25.\nWhy is this occurring? As treatments for cancer become more targeted, the protocol for selecting participants must be refined by the trial's investigators and sponsors, who are often academic researchers or pharmaceutical companies. Still, every exclusion criterion must be evaluated critically and justified as being directly relevant to preserving patient safety or producing a quality scientific outcome.\nWe found many clinical trials add restrictions related to the risks of new treatments, but often fail to remove those that are no longer relevant. For instance, trials for immunotherapy have introduced new criteria related to pre-existing autoimmune disease and use of immune suppressants. However, most of these trials continue to require that patients meet strict minimum white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts, a holdover from chemotherapy studies not necessarily relevant to immunotherapy.\nThe growing number of exclusions is shrinking the pool of candidates who can participate in trials and causing delays in drug development. Currently, fewer than 2 percent of adult cancer patients in the U.S. are treated in clinical trials. And my research shows that patients with a history of cancer are excluded in more than 80 percent of lung cancer trials.\nIf clinical trials only enroll a highly select minority of patients, we may not be able to generalize their results to a broader population who have the disease. For example, I recently had two patients excluded from lung cancer trials due to chronic hepatitis C, which is quite common and may not interfere with treatment.\nReversing this trend in clinical trial eligibility is possible. However, it will require advocacy, a careful dissection of study protocols and a revised attitude toward trial data. Recently, officials with the Food and Drug Administration joined researchers, study sponsors and others at a public meeting in Washington to discuss the topic. The FDA is expected to issue guidance on eligibility issues in the next year.\nRunning clinical trials effectively and efficiently is critical to medical progress. Allowing more patients to be enrolled in trials will speed the medical innovation process, allow more sick people to access potentially beneficial therapies, and produce more generalized results.\nDavid Gerber, M.D., is associate director for clinical research at the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas."}

We also know the current state of technology and the rate at which things are changing. Is it possible to get these two horizons to meet? And, perhaps more importantly, will we need to?\nThere was a definite tension among the panelists at the Nobel Week dialog about what the future of energy might hold and how well we could predict that future based on current trends. For example, Carl Henric Svanberg (of BP and Volvo) noted that, while renewables are the fastest growing portion of the energy market, if you extrapolate out current trends, non-hydro renewables will only cover six percent of the world's energy needs by 2030.\nAnd that's not good enough, Svenberg said: \"We need to move fast, because time is not on our side.\" He was one of a number of speakers who called for a carbon tax to tilt the economic scales. In his case, Svenberg said, \"I cannot understand how those who burn carbon get to do that without charge.\" It was put another way by Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, who referenced the increases in various extreme weather events by saying, \"The atmosphere was not sending invoices back to the economy. That has changed.\" Carbon taxes would be one way to forward those invoices on to the parties responsible.\nAlthough there was widespread agreement that a carbon tax would be a positive step, there seemed to be less unanimity as to whether it was absolutely necessary, since some aspects of the energy economy were already pushing us toward conservation and efficiency. Even without a carbon tax, the International Energy Agency's Fatih Birol noted that oil prices have hovered near or above $100 a barrel for about five years, something he called \"without precedent in market history.\"\nBut will this trend continue? Birol thought it would, but both he and others also shared stories about how their market predictions for oil ended up being badly wrong. And the Chief Economist of BP, Christof R\u00fchl, noted that oil's share of the global energy market has been dropping since the oil crises of the 1970s\u2014events that were driven by political considerations. Technology can also change things rapidly as well. The IPCC's Rajendra Pachauri pointed out that, as recently as five years ago, some projections were still completely ignoring the impact that shale gas would have on the energy economy.\nAnother speaker, Nebojsa Nakicenovic, emphasized the degree to which technology could alter how we use energy. He showed a slide with 50-year snapshots of various technologies, ranging from a primitive steam engine of the late 1800s to a bullet train, from a hot air balloon to a 747, from a horse to a Prius. At the time, many of the steps undoubtedly seemed evolutionary, but the cumulative impact has been radical.\nIf \"revolutions are a constant,\" as he put it, they're not necessarily distributed in the ways we might like. We can make heavy investments in the sorts of technology we need\u2014and Nakicenovic definitely felt we should do so, calling for a doubling in our investments\u2014but that won't guarantee we'll get everything we need. For example, he pointed out that continued emissions have ensured that most of the"}

Remember when Hamid Karzai amped up Afghan-US tensions in February when he moved to bring an independent election watchdog under his control? It was this maneuver that led the Obama administration to rescind an initial White House invite. Now, the Wall Street Journal reports, Karzai has staged a similar power play. Following the arrest of one of Karzai\u2019s top security aides on corruption charges, the Afghan president has clamped down on the two NATO-backed anti-corruption units that led the investigation.\nAccording to several Western officials, U.S.-backed investigators taped a conversation in which Mr. Saleh was negotiating a bribe\u2014in the form of a car\u2014in return for squashing an inquiry into the New Ansari Exchange, a large and influential money-transfer outfit. New Ansari has deep connections with prominent members of the Afghan government and the Karzai family, and, according to investigators, it is also suspected of links to Taliban insurgents and narcotics smugglers. The car, valued at about $10,000, was allegedly a small part of a larger proposed payoff, the officials said.\nSaleh\u2019s arrest by the anti-corruption units, which are run with the help of American and British adivisors, reportedly enraged Karzai, who viewed it as an assault of Afghan sovereignty. (Karzai apparently wasn\u2019t made aware of the operation, which raises its own set of questions.) As in February, when he felt the international community encroaching on the elections watchdog, Karzai swooped in. In this case, he\u2019s putting in place a commission that will monitor \u201call of the activities\u201d of both task forces, while also reviewing past and present investigations. \u201cThe president has ordered the commission to look into the overall practices of the MCTF because it seems that there are some aspects of where they went beyond the Afghan legislation and the constitution of Afghanistan,\u201d Karzai\u2019s top spokesman, Waheed Omar, said earlier this week.\nSince the Obama administration ramped up pressure on Karzai to crack down on corruption, the Afghan leader has taken a schizophrenic approach to the issue, making contradictory statements that cast doubt on his commitment.

{"idx": "35145", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Deadline has reported -- and it's now been confirmed -- that the previous buzz about an imminent Warner Bros. announcement of a Flash superhero movie are wrong, and the actual project is a television show from the creative team behind the successful Arrow series. The project was officially announced today to the TCA.\nArrow is among the CW's most successful series. Using the same creative team to develop Flash is akin to WB's choice to let Chris Nolan and David Goyer jump-start a new Superman film series, relying on proven success to help get an otherwise uncertain property up and running (sorry, bad pun).\nA televised Flash will obviously cost far less than investing in a big-screen adaptation, with the studio able to get an episode for probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 million or less, depending on how much VFX the shows use. That means they can likely get perhaps two seasons of a television series for the same cost of producing a big-budget superhero summer film adaptation, give or take. And the series will cross over with Arrow, helping supplement both shows and adding some crossover viewership to boost both series. If it's a success, the show will provide the opportunity to spin off either/both character(s) into movies -- Justice League, for example.\nBesides Arrow, Warner also attempted to develop a Wonder Woman series on the CW but that hasn't worked out so far, and today the CW confirmed that the project is on hold due to scripting problems. A previous Wonder Woman TV project resulted in a pilot that was widely panned and turned down by several networks.\nIt had been widely assumed that the buzz regarding a Warner Bros. Flash project was related to the studio's upcoming film plans, including the Batman vs. Superman movie planned for 2015 and the eventual Justice League superhero team-up film down the road.\nWarner's attempts to use the CW to launch superhero projects that they've been unsure of in the cinematic realm is a smart move on one hand, since it costs less to invest in a television attempt than a big-budget superhero movie. The plan makes good use of multiple mediums and could be used to build the broader fanbase for the characters through television and then bring those versions from the small screen to the big screen -- after all, Arrow is set in a fairly realistic world, and Flash is apparently going to coexist with that same world, so they hypothetically fit into the illusionary realism world of Man of Steel as well.\nIf this is indeed the plan, and we'll eventually see the television versions of Green Arrow and the Flash making their way to the Justice League movie in a few years, then I do see the strategy behind this approach. It's cost-effective, it uses a known brand (Arrow) to launch a new brand that already has some name recognition (Flash), and it helps with cross-promotion and utilizing multiple mediums to grow the larger DC superhero brand.\nOn the other hand, fans might be disappointed to see the studio demonstrating uncertainty yet again with another superhero character fans have been eager to see portrayed on the big screen. I wrote several days ago about the need for WB to move forward with a Wonder Woman movie, and the Flash seems to be one of the superheroes best positioned for a big-screen introduction due to his higher profile among the mainstream public and the chance to develop a superhero film that is also a police procedural of sorts. The danger is that this plan might project an impression of reluctance or lack of confidence in the broader mainstream potential for these particular characters.

Saudi Arabia denied threatening to cut off of humanitarian funding.\nBan described his decision to remove the coalition off the list as one of the most \"painful and difficult,\" but stood by his choice warning that \"millions of other children would suffer grievously\" in places such as Palestine, South Sudan and Syria if funding were cut.\nOPINION: Will seven million starving Yemenis ever find justice?\nIn mid-August, following the leaking of the report obtained by Al Jazeera, the Saudi UN Mission said \"there is no justification whatsoever for including its name in the annex of the Secretary-General's report on children and armed conflict [...] we trust that the UN will make the appropriate decision on this matter\" in a statement.\nYemen has been engulfed in a bloody civil war since September 2014 after Houthi rebels captured the capital, Sanaa, and overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government.\nMore than 10,000 have been killed, and three million have been displaced from their homes.\nAdditionally, more than 17 million people in Yemen are facing food shortages; the UN warns that the country is on the brink of famine with 80 percent of the country's children in desperate need of aid.\nParties listed in the report are not subjected to UN action.

And it\u2019s hobbling the potential of both technologies.\nIf you\u2019re hoping to create a product that changes the world, the iPhone seems like an obvious model for success. And in 2016, one of the most obvious new technologies on the cusp of a world-changing breakthrough is VR and AR. But there are plenty of reasons to think that the iPhone\u2019s example is actually hurting VR and AR. Let me explain.\nVR and AR are each exciting in their own right. Just imagine being able to travel from the bottom of the Mariana Trench to the top of Mount Everest in the span of a minute, or to see the real world overlaid with filters that bend it to your will. But more than that, these technologies potentially represent new interface paradigms\u2014and interface paradigms are what change the world. Just look at the mouse or the iPhone.\nBut the iPhone\u2019s success was unheralded for a different reason. For literally hundreds of years, innovations in technology have begun with the business world. The telephone was a business gadget before it was a household item; so too was the desktop computer. The iPhone broke that mold. It was a device that was launched first with consumers\u2014and only afterward caused a trickle-down effect known by the snooze-worthy jargon of \u201cthe consumerization of IT.\u201d But that trend was incredibly powerful. After all, it really was the iPad that inspired the CEO of GE to ask why the software that runs a jet engine wasn\u2019t just as easy to use. That conversation happened in myriad different industries, from health care to manufacturing.\nIt was as if the normal laws of gravity had been turned off. Why putz around with wonky gadgets designed for industry when you could just go directly to consumers, garnering headlines and buzz? Perhaps the most famous victim of that thinking was Google Glass. Glass made sense as a surgical aid or a repairman\u2019s futuristic how-to manual. But it never made sense as a gadget for your family\u2014even if your family was exceptionally dorky.\nIn retrospect, the consumer-first strategy behind Glass seems clearly ridiculous. But the ridiculous part is that it\u2019s happening yet again.\nWhen you look at the $1 billion acquisition for Oculus, or a $750 million dollar investment in Magic Leap, you\u2019re seeing bets based on the assumption that these gadgets won\u2019t just be modestly successful when they arrive\u2014they\u2019ll be almost ubiquitous, as the iPhone was.\nWe don\u2019t know how much Microsoft has spent on Hololens, but the very design of the gadget speaks to the expectation that it\u2019ll be a product for the masses. It isn\u2019t tethered to a big computer\u2014it\u2019s meant to be mobile. Its industrial design is also surprisingly slick and lust-worthy. But as well designed as it is, the fact that it\u2019s not tethered means that it\u2019s far too underpowered at present to deliver on the true promise of AR\u2014the promise of having almost limitless data about everything within your gaze, or being able to look through the eyes of another person.

The facts are devastating for Blair, for parliament and for all of us.\nPhoto Op, by kennardphillipps. All rights reserved.\nTwo weeks ago I found myself in conversation with Dr Hans Blix, head of the United Nations weapons inspection team ahead of the Iraq invasion in 2003.\nDr Blix told me that Tony Blair\u2019s claims about Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction were simply not an accurate reflection of the intelligence provided to the British government.\n\"The big difference in the British dossier,\u201d Dr Blix told me, \u201cwas that they simply asserted that these items are there. But when Mr Blair asserts that there were weapons, well that's an assertion and it was not supported by evidence. Both the UK and the US replaced question marks by exclamation marks. I certainly think it was a misrepresentation.\"\nShaken by the force of his testimony I eventually said to Dr Blix: \"That's devastating. And so basically you are telling me that Mr Blair misrepresented the truth, lied indeed to the British parliament in order to make the case for an illegal war?\"\nHe paused. Then he said: \"Well, I'm a diplomat, so I'm not using such\u2026 such words. But in substance, yes. They misrepresented what we did and they did so in order to get the authorisation that they shouldn't have had\".\nDr Blix\u2019s comments were made before Tony Blair claimed to CNN earlier this week that the information he had received was \u201cwrong\u201d. As far as Hans Blix is concerned, Tony Blair misled the British public and parliament about the intelligence he was given.\nMy conversation with Dr Blix was the culminating moment of my search for the truth about how Britain came to invade Iraq. It is now a matter of days before John Chilcot will write to David Cameron setting out the timetable for publication for his long delayed inquiry into the Iraq war.\nOne report has suggested that Chilcot may push back his report as far as 2017 \u2013 no less than seven years late, and a full decade after the last British troops pulled out of Iraq in 2007. The delay in his inquiry, commissioned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009, has become a national scandal.

I also suggested that we should call our own witnesses.\nThe BBC agreed.

The results can be heard tonight on BBC Radio 4.\nQuestion 1: Did Tony Blair enter into a secret agreement with George W Bush that the UK would support US military action, come what may?\nQuestion 2: Was the information presented by the Blair government on WMD and other matters an accurate reflection of the underlying facts?\nQuestion 3: Was the war legal?\nQuestion 4: Did our military action in Iraq increase the terrorist threat to Britain?\nI have known Dr Morrison for more than 12 years.

The venerable newspaper continues to add digital subscribers, but lower advertising sales remain a challenge.\nData source: The New York Times Company Q2 2016 earnings press release.\nWhat happened with The New York Times Company this quarter?\nTotal revenue fell 2.7% year over year to $373 million, as an 11.7% decline in advertising revenue negated a 3% rise in circulation revenue. Circulation revenue grew as digital subscription sales and a price increase for home delivery of The New York Times more than offset a decline in the number of print copies sold.\nThe Times added 67,000 paid subscribers to its digital-only subscription products in the second quarter. Digital-only subscribers totaled 1,424,000 at the end of Q2 -- a 25% increase from the prior-year period. That helped to drive a 15.3% year-over-year rise in circulation revenue from digital-only subscription products to $56.4 million.\n\"We once again saw a robust quarter in terms of digital subscriber growth, with 51,000 net paid digital-only subscriptions to our news products added in Q2 and growth of 22 percent year-over-year,\" said CEO Mark Thompson in a press release. \"Much of our success in building our digital pay model is the result of a renewed effort to clearly communicate the value of Times journalism and our products through mission-related, native messaging to an expanding number of highly engaged readers.\"\nStill, declining advertising sales remain a challenge for the company. Second-quarter print advertising revenue fell 14.1% to $86 million. Digital advertising revenue also weakened, declining 6.8% to $45 million.\nIn digital, we saw very strong growth in mobile, video and virtual reality, branded content and programmatic advertising. These were not enough to offset declines in traditional web display in Q2, which led to an overall decline in digital advertising. However, we expect that situation to improve in the second half of the year; in fact, we are already seeing a marked turnaround in July.\nOperating costs fell 1% to $340 million, mostly due to lower non-operating retirement costs. On an adjusted basis, operating costs were relatively flat year over year at $318 million, as lower print production and distribution costs were offset by higher costs in advertising and technology.\nAll told, operating profit -- adjusted to exclude depreciation, amortization, severance and retirement costs, and other special items -- fell 15% to $54.5 million. And adjusted EPS from continuing operations declined 15% to $0.11.\nThe New York Times expects third-quarter total circulation revenues to increase at a rate similar to that of the second quarter. The company also estimates that total advertising revenues will decrease \"in the mid-single digits\" compared with the third quarter of 2015.\nAdditionally, operating costs are projected to increase in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis as the company works to further reduce its cost structure while continuing to invest in its digital growth initiatives.\n\"We expect to deliver strong revenue growth from both digital advertising and our digital consumer business in Q3,\" added Thompson. \"And finally, in the quarter, we have undertaken a variety"}

The Ultimate Dreams 12-inch Supreme Gel Memory Foam Mattress is our top pick because it has a firmness that suits most sleepers and you can try it out in your home risk-free for 120 nights.\nWhen the economy is doing well and we have a little padding in our bank accounts, our thoughts turn to replacing old worn-out mattresses. In recent years, dozens of new companies have sprung up with the goal of delivering comfortable foam mattresses to your door. When ordering from the right company, this can be a pleasant experience.\nHowever, you need to know what to look for and determine whether foam mattresses are right for you. Before making our recommendations for the best foam mattresses you can order online, we will explore what to look for as you shop.\nThere is no single mattress that will work well for all types of sleepers. Fortunately, most mattress brands offer a risk-free return policy. The best companies let you try out the foam mattresses for around 100 nights, and if you are not satisfied, you get a full refund. Therefore, we strongly recommend selecting a mattress that comes with a trial period.\nThe mattresses we researched have between two and five foam layers. There is typically a thick bottom support layer meant for long-term stability and thinner upper layer(s) designed for support, comfort, and airflow for a cooler sleep.\nThe density of each layer is generally listed in pounds, but it's really a measurement of how heavy a cubic foot of the material is (abbreviated PCF.) Basically, the denser a foam is, the more durable, high-quality, supportive, and expensive it will be. The Sleep Judge provides a more thorough explanation of how to assess quality based on foam density.\nA queen-sized foam mattress typically weighs about 70 pounds when it arrives. Unless you regularly spend time hitting the weights, this is a bit much for an individual to carry on their own. We recommend getting help to carry the box, remove the mattress, and set it up.\nYou should also keep in mind that you will not be able to use your mattress right away. Most companies recommend that you allow 72 hours for your new arrival to expand to its natural size and to release any odors, or \"off-gas.\"\nWe combed through countless buyer and expert reviews and ratings for dozens of different mattress brands while preparing this guide. The five mattresses we chose to showcase in the following slides have a strong track record for durability, comfort, support, and customer service.\nWhy you'll love it: The Ultimate Dreams 12-inch Supreme Gel Memory Foam Mattress offers a medium firmness and competes with the luxury brands when it comes to comfort and support.\nDreamfoam Bedding is not a household name because the company doesn't spend a ton marketing the brand. With the lower overhead, Dearfoam Bedding can produce top-quality mattresses like this Ultimate Dreams mattress at an affordable price. This mattress tops our list because of its long trial period, iron-clad warranty, and a \"Goldilocks\" firmness level.\nThe 12 inches of the Ultimate Dreams Supreme Gel Memory Foam Mattress are made up of three layers: 8-inches of premium base foam, 2.5-inches of 4-pound memory foam, and a 1.5-inch top layer of 4-pound gel memory foam."}

Their boss, Executive Director for Licensing and Market Conduct Anatol Monid, decided in May 2015 that there was not enough evidence to proceed, the documents show.\nThat decision was part of a larger, more troubling pattern: From 2011 to 2015, Reuters has found, senior FSCO investigators rejected or ignored compliance officers\u2019 multiple recommendations that the agency investigate or take action to rein in the marketing and sales of Fortress syndicated mortgages.\nSince then, growing investor outcry about the products has focused public and government attention on FSCO\u2019s lax regulation of the market. In the past decade, more than 20,000 retail investors have put as much as C$1.5 billion (US$1.17 billion) into syndicated mortgages, mostly in Ontario, according to regulatory sources. Roughly 90 percent of those investments, the sources said, have ended in a loss or are at risk of doing so, and Fortress projects make up more than half of the investments.\nThe documents seen by Reuters, supported by interviews with 10 sources familiar with FSCO\u2019s activities, show that the agency didn\u2019t merely miss the problem; its senior investigators ignored or downplayed clear warnings from within their own ranks that retail investors were being sucked into a market to which they were ill-suited.\nAs yield-hungry savers were pouring their money into the investments to profit from Ontario\u2019s red-hot real estate market, FSCO compliance staff opened at least 17 Fortress-related investigations, according to the sources and internal FSCO documents.\nIn at least 10 of those cases, FSCO staff found possible breaches of Ontario law that they felt warranted action. The breaches included misleading marketing, selling products unsuited to clients\u2019 risk tolerance, and failure to disclose the risks and costs of the investments, among other infractions. And in all but one case, FSCO\u2019s investigators either overruled or ignored the recommendations.\nWhy the FSCO investigation team repeatedly declined to pursue recommended investigations isn't clear. Current and former FSCO staff said the investigators, most of them former police officers, lacked the required skills and knowledge and were discouraged by senior regulators from pursuing complex cases.\nIn the Olympia episode, Monid\u2019s decision not to proceed was all the more surprising because FSCO had long known that the Calgary, Alberta, trust company was active in Ontario without a license: The agency\u2019s own lawyers had rejected Olympia\u2019s requests, in 2011 and 2013, that it"}
{"idx": "35176", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Helen Reinherz's \"kids\" - all 400 of them - started kindergarten in 1977. They weren't her biological children, of course, but she has spent the last 30 years rooting for them as if they were.\nAs the head of one of the longest-running mental health projects in the country, the Simmons Longitudinal Study, she has used her kids to compile a repository of important statistics on human emotional development. But Reinherz, who is 84 with a regal bearing, has never let her position as a research scientist overshadow her natural empathy as a human.\nWhen she began the project, studying the entire 1977 kindergarten class in the Quincy public schools (there were 700 at first, though she lost 200 almost immediately to parochial schools and another 100 from natural attrition), she thought she might stay with them through the third grade and focus on their early childhood development. But she grew attached to them and has continued to pop back into their lives every few years.\nAs her kids entered their tumultuous teen years, she began to see signs for concern, such as the fact that 20 percent had thought about suicide.\nAnd so she did what she felt she had to do: If her kids needed help, she helped them get it (though she was always confidential, so as not to violate their trust).\nIn some ways, this sounds counterintuitive for a social researcher; the implication being that she is tainting her own sample. She sees it another way.\n\"I would be violating my own oath if I allowed people to destroy themselves,\" says the sassy octogenarian.\nWhich is why, as the longitudinal study enters its fourth decade, Reinherz has turned her attention toward the factors that can turn a high-risk youth into a happy adult. Statistically speaking, many - but not all - of the children who showed early signs of trouble have been found to be less mentally healthy than those who did not.\n\"We want to look at how those who were miserable at 15 are flourishing at 30,\" Reinherz said from her top-floor office in the Simmons College School of Social Work. \"Was it something that happened, a relationship, a skill that came into play as they got older, family support? Only longitudinal studies can look at prior factors.\"\nIdentifying children in crisis and working to tilt their trajectory has defined Reinherz's career. In the late '50s, she worked as a social worker and oversaw a program that brought student mentors in from Harvard and Radcliffe to work with adolescents at a state mental hospital who were suffering from serious mental health problems.\n\"We got the patients the professionals didn't want,\" she remembered,\" and yet they seemed to flourish under the attention of the students.\"\nIn the '60s, she studied the emotional impact of academic failure on students who had been kept back, which allowed her to form a close bond with the Quincy schools that led, ultimately to the longitudinal study.\nRose Giaconia, who has worked with Reinherz on the research since 1990, said that what always impresses her about Reinherz is the desire to find the positive - which she said is rare in academia.\n\"If we analyze data and find something positive, she's very excited,\" Giaconia said. \"We're trying to predict which individuals will have problems, but she always has a goal toward practical applications, things they can do to improve their situation. And that compassion is infectious.\"\nReinherz sends out"}

This year Purim will be celebrated on March 24th & 25th.\nAccording to the Book of Esther, Haman, the royal vizier to the Persian King Ahasuerus, planned to kill all the Jews in the empire, but his plans were foiled by Mordechai and his adopted daughter, Queen Esther.\nThe heroes of the story are Esther, a beautiful young Jewish woman living in Persia, and her uncle Mordechai, who raised her as if she were his daughter. Esther was taken into the house of Ahasuerus, King of Persia. Esther found favor with King Ahasuerus' and he loved Esther more than his other women and made Esther his queen, but the king did not know that Esther was a Jew, because Mordechai told her not to reveal her identity.\nThe villain of the story is Haman, an arrogant, egotistical advisor to the king. Haman hated Mordechai because he refused to bow down to Haman, so Haman plotted to destroy the Jewish people. Haman told the king, \"There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your realm. Their laws are different from those of every other people's, and they do not observe the king's laws; therefore it is not befitting the king to tolerate them.\" Esther 3:8. The king gave the fate of the Jewish people to Haman, to do as he pleased with them. Haman planned to exterminate all of the Jews.\nMordechai persuaded Esther to speak to the king on behalf of the Jewish people. This was a dangerous thing for Esther to do, because anyone who came into the king's presence without being summoned could be put to death. Esther fasted for three days to prepare herself, then went to see the king, unsummopned!! He welcomed her. Later, she told him of Haman's plot against her people. The Jewish people were saved, and Haman and his ten sons were hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordechai.\nThis day of deliverance became a day of feasting and rejoicing. Purim is celebrated by giving mutual gifts of food and drink (mishloach manot), giving charity to the poor (mattanot la-evyonim), and a celebratory meal (se'udat Purim). The scroll of Esther is read publicly (kriat ha-megillah). During the reading of the scroll of Esther at the mention of the name \"Haman\" a deafening noise erupts - noise makers, rattles and feet stomping are employed to drown out the name of evil. An additional blessing (al hannisim) is added to prayers and grace after meals on this day. Other customs include drinking wine, wearing of masks and costumes, and public celebration."}

All of the downside came from its defense segment, which has been hit hard by the Brazilian government's spending cutbacks. Embraer maintained its operating income guidance, though.\nEmbraer stock has now given up all of its gains from 2013 and 2014. However, the market seems to be overly pessimistic about Embraer's future prospects. Steady performance from its commercial airplanes and executive jets divisions along with easier comparisons should provide significant upside for the stock.\nIn Q2, revenue declined on a year-over-year basis in all three of Embraer's key business segments, but primarily in the commercial and defense segments. The company's operating margin also declined sharply, to 6.8%: down from 10.6% a year earlier. This drove a 45% year-over-year decline in operating income.\nOn the commercial airplanes side -- which represents more than half of Embraer's revenue -- it delivered 27 airplanes, compared to 29 in the year-earlier period. This drove most of the segment's $89 million revenue decline.\nAn unfavorable mix shift also affected the segment's results. In Q2 2014, Embraer delivered 13 of its larger E190 and E195 airplanes, along with 16 of the smaller E175. By contrast, the E175 constituted 22 of its 27 deliveries last quarter. The E175 brings in less revenue and typically has a lower profit margin for Embraer, contributing to the revenue and profit margin declines.\nThe E175 is a less profitable model than its larger siblings. Image source: Embraer.\nMeanwhile, the defense business was hit by two issues. First, the Brazilian government delayed the timetable for introducing Embraer's new KC-390 military transport jet. This will reduce Embraer's program development revenue for the next couple of years or so.\nSecond, the falling value of Brazil's real against the dollar meant that Embraer's Brazilian defense contracts will bring in less revenue. More immediately, it forces a cost base revision for accounting purposes: essentially a one-time charge marking up dollar-denominated costs to the new exchange rate. This charge was about $25 million in Q2, following a similar $30 million charge in Q1.\nInvestors don't seem to realize that most of the factors holding back Embraer's profitability are transitory. As they fade in the coming months, Embraer's financial performance should bounce back.\nFirst, on the commercial side, Embraer faces much easier comparisons going forward. In the first half of 2014, the larger E190 and E195 models made up 42% of Embraer's commercial deliveries. In the second half of the year,"}

{"idx": "35194", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As I\u2019ve stressed over and over here in my series of articles during Invasive Plant Awareness Month, it is often the common name used by various gardeners, growers and organizations that creates a great deal of confusion when it comes to regulating and understanding invasive plants.\nThe plant I am featuring today is one of the best examples of this. Depending upon who you speak to, or where you look online, this plant goes by many different names, including Mexican bamboo, Chinese bamboo, Japanese knotweed, fleeceflower and many more. The latin, or scientific name is Polygonum cuspidatum, but that is of little to no value when the plant is not for sale, but simply on a rampage through our native habitats.\nI\u2019ll go with Japanese knotweed, since that appears to be the common name used most often. A related species, also invasive, called giant knotweed, is nearly identical in habit, form and appearance.\nWhatever you call it, Japanese knotweed is one of the most imposing of all invasive plants, growing quickly to 10 feet or tall, with thick, bamboo-like, hollow stems and dense, intertwined roots and rhizomes that are nearly impossible to eradicate once the plant becomes established.\nThe name fleeceflower is familiar to many gardeners for the many garden varieties that are currently available. Fleeceflowers bloom at the tip of the stalk in a mass of fluffy, white blooms. Japanese knotweed is a member of the garden fleeceflower family. The flowers are borne all along the stalk, though most heavily concentrated near the tip. It blooms from midsummer through early fall.\nThe tall, gracefully arched stalks of this giant plant are deceptively attractive, with reddish green stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are evenly spaced along the entire length of the plant.\nBecause it quickly forms immense stands of arching growth that can reach maximum height in just a few short weeks in late spring, Japanese knotweed is a dangerous invader that quickly overtakes large areas and spreads through underground rhizomes.\nPlants are easy enough to cut or pull, but repeated action is needed, often for years, once the plant is established, because the underground and surface rhizomes spread so voraciously. Any small piece left in the ground will multiply and spread. Unfortunately, cutting only stimulates the rhizome below, meaning once you begin cutting, you will need to continue for as long as it takes to finally eradicate the plant. This could mean several seasons.\nHerbicides such as Roundup will work, but only on the fresh cut cane rim (the edge of the hollow) and only if applied literally within minutes of a fresh cut. If you wait much longer than that, the plant has already sealed itself back up and the Roundup will not be effective. Apply only to the cut stems, preferably with a brush. Repeated applications and repeated cuttings will be needed, again, often over multiple growing seasons.\nColonies of Japanese knotweed, like so many other invasives, quickly shade out native plants on the ground, taking over roadsides, hillsides, parks, even backyard gardens."}

As a citizen, and as President, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. And that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in Lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America. And our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable. The principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country and that they will not be treated differently by their government is essential to who we are. The writ of the Founders must endure.\nRepublican presidential hopeful Herman Cain on Sunday said US communities that want to ban mosques have a right to do so, as he backed opponents of a mosque being built in Tennessee.\n\"Islam is both a religion and a set of laws -- Sharia laws. That's the difference between any one of our traditional religions where it's just about religious purposes,\" Cain told Fox News Sunday.\nAsked whether a community, like the one in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, should be able to \"ban a mosque,\" Cain replied: \"Yes, they have the right to do that.\"\nThat's not a politically correct answer -- but it's constitutionally correct.\nFirst, the heretical statements: contrary to what many believe, there is no federal right to freedom of religion. And people do not have an automatic right to build mosques in Tennessee or any other state.\nAbove, Mr. Obama says that Muslims have the right to build mosques \"in accordance with local laws and ordinances.\" But what if a state or local law were to prohibit the building of mosques? You can bet your bottom dollar that Obama would say that a federal right of religious freedom trumps the state law.\nBut contrary to what Obama believes, the writ of the Founders was to prevent the federal government from exerting central control over the states in the ordinary affairs of life, including matters of religion.\nThe U.S. Constitution was ratified with the assurance that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" In context, the Constitution says what the federal government cannot do; it does not provide a nationwide right of religious freedom.\nThe states are not prohibited by the Constitution from either establishing religion or prohibiting free exercise. In fact, during the period when the individual states ratified the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, most had their own official state religions. Many states endorsed the Christian religion well into the mid-20th century.\nIn 1808, President Thomas Jefferson broke from his two predecessors and decided against issuing a national proclamation for religious exercise. Jefferson did so because of our federalist system of government created by the Constitution.\n...results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment, or free exercise, or religion, but from that also which reserves to the states the powers not delegated to the US. Certainly no power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the general [federal] government.\nJefferson concludes his letter to Miller by noting the practice of his predecessors. But had they examined the issue of federal jurisdiction, they \"would have discovered that what might be a right in a state government, was a violation of that right when assumed by another.\"\nThe individual states have retained the power under the Constitution to regulate religion, including the right to ban mosques based on safety concerns -- or, for that matter, for any reason.

Both stocks performed well this year, with Baidu jumping nearly 65% and Yandex advancing almost 60%.\nBut after those big rallies, is either stock still worth buying? Let's take a closer look at their business models, growth trajectories, and valuations to find out.\nBaidu controls about 80% of China's internet search market. It soundly conquered the market after Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google left the country in 2010. Like Google, Baidu expanded its ecosystem to include news sites, mapping services, streaming video, an artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant, and even autonomous cars. It's also expanding its online-to-offline (O2O) ecosystem, which allows users to hail rides, order goods, make mobile payments, and access other services without leaving its mobile app.\nYandex still competes against Google in Russia, but its 49% market share remains slightly higher than Google's 47%. Yandex notably handles \"CrazyFont\" -- Russian written in English without using Cyrillic letters (popular among Russians who don't have Cyrillic keyboards) -- better than Google. Yandex's expanding ecosystem includes portal sites, e-commerce marketplaces, ride-hailing services, and online classifieds.\nBaidu's revenue rose 35% in 2015 but just 6% in 2016, due to two one-time events -- a government crackdown on misleading ads (mostly for healthcare products) and a swap of its stake in online travel agency Qunar for one in Ctrip. With these issues now in the rearview mirror, analysts expect Baidu's revenue to rise 22% this year. Most of Baidu's revenue still comes from its advertising business, which accounted for 86% of its top line last quarter.\nBaidu's current game plan is to divest or spin off weaker businesses (like its food delivery subsidiary) and increase its investments in the mobile and AI markets. Those moves could widen its moat against rivals like WeChat maker Tencent (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) and e-commerce titan Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) -- which have both been aggressively expanding their ecosystems.\nYandex's revenue rose 18% in 2015, and accelerated to 27% growth in 2016. Analysts expect 23% growth this year. Advertising revenue accounted for 96% of its sales last quarter.\nYandex is investing heavily in improving its core search technology, expanding its language capabilities, and refining its targeted ads. It recently launched Yandex.Radar, a search traffic and browser user analytics tool, an open-source machine learning library called CatBoost, and Alice, the first AI-powered virtual assistant designed for the Russian market.

She's at a loss to understand what took everything out of their kitchen cabinets and parked these things in precarious stacks, all the way to the ceiling. Daniel (Hamilton) is less credulous.\nHe's fibbing to her about his job interviews, and she's not telling him everything that's going on at home, how little Sammy (Kaden Rockett) keeps having nightmares about \"The Sand Man.\"\nThe lies come out and the marriage earns its ugliest test when they come face to face with the impossible. The movie sinks or swims not on our belief that this is happening to them, but on the players' beliefs, and neither adult gets frantic or worked up enough to be convincing.\nAt the very least, the first time Lacy spies a spindly alien from \"Signs\" standing over her child's bed, her freak-out should be epic. Both actors play muted shock, not panic.\nAnd panic was called for.\nAs episodes pile up - catatonic fits, mass bird collisions with their house, strange bruising on their kids (Dakota Goyo is Jesse, the oldest) that has the neighbors sure they're nut-job child-abusers, you'd expect a mania to set in. Daniel and Lacy can only manage confusion, and solutions borrowed from \"Paranormal Activity\" (surveillance cameras), \"Night of the Living Dead\" (barricading the windows) and every other modern horror movie (Internet searches, where \"The Truth,\" or at least the conspiracy, is out there).\nThat last step delivers the movie's most fascinating character, an \"expert\" (J.K. Simmons) on \"visitations\" whose resignation and exhaustion at their fate, which mirrors his, seems earned. Lacy and Daniel seem beaten before they start.\nVisual effects man turned writer-director Scott Stewart has turned away from the \"Legion\" and \"Priest\" D-movies with their angels and vampires and patched together something of an expertly shot and cut mash-up here. He's very good at managing tension, and the script doles out the requisite shocks at decent intervals.\nBut what's missing is that \"Insidious\" empathy, the sense of parents terrified for their kids, a terror that the viewer should and would share - if only we'd been given more reason to care or a surer sense that they do.\nWritten and directed by Scott Stewart."}

There were 100,000 cancellations in the same period, up 100% from the same three months a year ago.\nMasFlight estimates that 7.8 million passengers have had a flight canceled since the start of December. The cost to them: Roughly $5.3 billion, due to lost productivity as well as extra meals and hotel stays.\nThe expense to airlines caused by all this disruption has been considerably less: The industry has lost about $500 million. Most of that is due to revenue that's lost when fliers don't rebook their trip. Airlines also take a hit when passengers do rebook, because that limits the airline's ability to sell those seats to other passengers. The cost of dealing with bad weather is partly offset by what the airlines save on fuel and labor when a flight is canceled.\nTulinda Larsen, vice president of masFlight, says that while the bad weather is much of the reason for the surge in flight trouble, there are new Federal Aviation Administration rules that are also a factor. These rules require more rest for pilots, and place limits on how long a plane can be parked on the tarmac before taking off. The regulations have forced airlines to cancel flights that they wouldn't have otherwise.\n\"Without the rules we now have in place, the airlines had much more flexibility to reposition and reschedule flights,\" she said.\nThe good news for airlines is that they were in much better financial shape heading into this winter than they have been than in past years.

Murray hasn\u2019t found a use for peanut butter on pizza or Italian food other than putting it in a pesto.\nOf all the kinds of nut butters you can make, peanut butter has the strongest flavor, so if you\u2019re looking for a more mild earthiness to a dish, consider almond or cashew butter.\nAll nut butters are packed with protein and vitamins, but they have long carried the label of being relatively high in fat. However, many people have come to realize that our bodies need fat, especially the good fats, and that low-fat foods typically load up on sugar to compensate for the lack of fat and flavor.\nMurray says that making nut butter at home allows you to add as much or as little salt and sugar as you\u2019d like, and you can puree it until it is as chunky or smooth as you prefer \u2014 or perhaps make some smooth and some crunchy by dividing the batch in half.\nNut allergies are an issue in the U.K. as in the U.S., Murray says. Current research suggests that exposing young children to nuts at an early age might be what keeps them from developing an allergy, and some people who have allergies to one kind of nut might be OK eating a butter made from a seed or legume, such as a roasted soybean.\nPeanut butter has been around England for 80 years, Murray says, but they don\u2019t eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. \u201cThere is a nostalgia for having it for breakfast on toast,\u201d she says.

The 33-year-old forward is a three-time NBA champion, four-time MVP and 14-time All-Star who has appeared in eight straight NBA Finals, the latest of which took a herculean effort.\nWilliamson certainly is talented, of that there is no doubt.

{"idx": "35227", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Stadia logo on display outside the Game Developers Conference 2019 in San Francisco, March 18, 2019.\nThis week, Google announced its fancy new Stadia game-streaming service to the world\u2014though the question of just how the tech giant is planning on monetizing it remains quite open. It\u2019s not clear whether users will gain access to Stadia\u2019s stable of games by purchasing individual titles, paying a monthly subscription fee, or even be able to play for free in an ad-supported model.\nSpeaking to Business Insider on Friday, some industry analysts were skeptical that the last option is viable, given the immense costs of developing blockbuster game titles and the need for development firms to know they will be able to turn a profit.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a new battle royal game that just came out and you want to get people playing your game, ultimately the best place to advertise would be within other games that are similar,\u201d Haggstrom said.\nHaggstrom thinks the Google service is likely to adopt a similar approach to the mega-popular Fortnite, which doesn\u2019t charge players to download its game, but instead allows for in-game purchases of \u201cskins\u201d and other cosmetic items. This type of in-game purchase model could make sense, he believes, given Stadia has been touting an open platform with very few barriers to entry.\nGamers are also notoriously fickle, and many are already reaching the end of their patience on nickle-and-dime tactics like microtransactions, so it\u2019s hard to see them adapting well to a model that requires interrupting their playthroughs every so often to be bombarded with ads.\nUltimately, however, the expenses of running an ad-supported model may be too great for Google to bear. Existing competitors typically go with subscription models.\nGoogle VP Phil Harrison suggested to Polygon that the service will require spending immense amounts of money to work in the first place; Stadia will be, at least in theory, simultaneously streaming games at HD resolutions at high framerates to millions of users, and it\u2019s suggested that it will have the capacity to do so at far higher graphical fidelity (and scale, such as 1,000-player Battle Royale matches) than existing consoles.\nBeyond how, exactly, users will gain access to Stadia, other questions about the service remain. One is whether foregoing ownership of individual titles in exchange for access to a streaming platform that can set its own terms is worth the tradeoff. Another is whether Google can build partnerships with industry players wary of upheaval and/or jump wholesale into in-house game development, a tricky business that sometimes goes horribly wrong for even industry titans like Bethesda (the ruinous release of Fallout 76, for one). As the Verge noted, Google is also leaning heavily into YouTube and Twitch integration as a promotional tool, as well as a Crowd Play feature that will allow gamers to play with their favorite streamers, but pulling this off without exposing those streamers to harassment and trolling could be difficult."}

Cohen, could intensify the legal issues facing the president in the criminal and civil investigations that are swirling around him, legal experts said.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee was a remarkable personal and political rebuke to the president from a lawyer who served Mr. Trump with fierce loyalty for more than a decade.\nBut legal experts said several of the specific allegations by Mr. Cohen in his opening statement could be relevant to questions about whether Mr. Trump participated in a conspiracy to affect the 2016 election, violated campaign finance laws and obstructed justice in an effort to deflect investigations.\nThe experts cautioned that nothing Mr. Cohen said drastically altered what was known about any legal case against the president. The relevant laws are complex, and the president\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly argued that he did not violate them. And perhaps most important, they note, there is a Justice Department policy that asserts that a president may not be indicted while in office.\nIn his prepared remarks, Mr. Cohen described in detail how Mr. Trump personally reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, to ensure her silence about an affair with Mr. Trump.\nRichard L. Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, said prosecutors could use Mr. Cohen\u2019s description of the payments from Mr. Trump to bolster a charge of campaign finance violations.\n\u201cTo the extent that these were illegal campaign finance contributions, which were reimbursed and not reported, here is more evidence that Trump was conspiring to violate campaign finance laws as president,\u201d Mr. Hasen said.\nHe noted, however, that campaign finance laws \u2014 which are complex \u2014 require proof that a person was willfully violating them. Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony does not prove that Mr. Trump knew that the payments he was making were illegal \u2014 something that prosecutors would have to prove if they wanted to charge the president.\nIn his testimony, Mr. Cohen described a moment when he said Roger J. Stone Jr., one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top political operatives, called the president to tell him about a conversation with Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.\nLegal experts cautioned that just proving that Mr. Trump knew about the WikiLeaks plans to leak damaging documents ahead of time would not necessarily prove that the president or his campaign were guilty of conspiracy.

But nearly 200 Marines would end up on the front lines of the fight against ISIS.\nThe world learned the Marine artillery detachment had entered Iraq with news of tragedy: Staff Sgt. Louis Cardin, 27, was killed in a rocket attack at Fire Base Bell, a new outpost in Northern Iraq created shortly before the Marines occupied it.\nCardin was the second U.S. service member to be killed in the fight against ISIS, and the first Marine.\nShortly after Cardin's death, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller praised the Marine's leadership and commitment to duty.\n\"He was leading his Marines in combat,\" Neller said March 26 at a Marine Association event. \"They were in indirect fire and he made sure everybody got in the bunker, and he just didn't make it in time \u2026 That's sad. But if you're going to go, you want to go in the fight.\"\nThe commander of the 26th MEU, Col. Robert Fulford, said that the artillery battery, which consisted of two M777A2 howitzers and two 120-mm mortar systems and was nicknamed Task Force Spartan, had fired more than 2,000 rounds at the enemy in 486 fire missions during their brief three months in Iraq.\n\"The whole team did a fantastic job,\" Fulford told an audience at the Potomac Institute near Washington, D.C., on Thursday.\nFulford said preparation for the possibility of deployment into Iraq had begun months ahead of time, as the MEU conducted training around the Middle East.\n\"There was a discussion of ways to accelerate the campaign in Iraq. You heard the secretary of defense refer to that, I believe as early as the December timeframe,\" Fulford said. \"We began to get indications that some of those accelerants may reside inside of the 26th MEU inventory. And so we started preparing for it.\"\nWhile Marines attached to Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Central Command were already on the ground in two locations in Iraq, the task force did not have any artillery assets. Fire Base Bell, formally known as the Karasoar Counterfire Complex, was established near Makhmour to support Iraqi troops who were putting pressure on the ISIS stronghold of Mosul.\nAhead of a deployment order, the MEU offloaded about 80 artillerymen, 80 riflemen, and 20 engineers and other enablers in Kuwait in February. They would spend a month together training, resting and firing weapons ahead of their insertion into Iraq.\nMeanwhile, the MEU sent a team in to scout the location of the base, working with the Army and local personnel to build an austere position that would support the Marines.\nBefore the battery deployed to Iraq, Fulford and the MEU's senior enlisted leader, Sgt. Maj. Brett Scheuer, paid a personal visit to the unit in Kuwait to encourage them and prepare them for a mission with high stakes that would become apparent all too soon. Fulford said he sent them off with a pep talk. The battery would outstay the MEU by a month in the Middle East, returning home in June"}

But if they stopped for a moment, they would see something else, a painting inspired by a Georges Seurat masterpiece, but turned into a Harlem version of it.\nIt was painted by the artist Eva Cockcroft in 1986. For two years, conservationists and artists had been restoring this faded mural. Finally, they unveiled their work on Thursday.\nThe colors resemble Seurat\u2019s work \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\u201d But this is La Grande Jatte in Harlem \u2013 where a bugler announces that it\u2019s church time, African-Americans stroll and the bold jewel tones of the Caribbean and the American South replace the soft French Impressionist palette.\nThat wasn\u2019t easy, considering that some of the original work, attached to stucco, had fallen from its the wall on the apartment building. Also, Ms. Cockcroft didn\u2019t use a primer coat or a varnish, decisions that exposed the paint to the elements and hastened the deterioration.\nSo instead of reviving the original work, the artists repainted the mural. They consulted photographs from 1986, under the guidance of Harriet Irgang Alden of Rustin Levenson Art Conservation.\nBesides the color, Ms. Cockcroft\u2019s other fundamental artistic technique was the application to stucco, which created an interplay between color and texture. It represented her interpretation of the pointillism technique for which Seurat was well known.\nThe mural, \u201cHomage to Seurat: La Grande Jatte in Harlem,\u201d is the only remaining New York City work by Ms. Cockcroft, a prominent painter in the community mural movement, which began in the 1960s. It was the first mural to be restored by Rescue Public Murals, a national program founded in 2006 to preserve the historic and artistic value of community murals.\nWhile some community murals, including many of Ms. Cockcroft\u2019s, represent political and social movements, this one was meant to represent the beauty of surrounding Hamilton Heights, Ms. Braun-Reinitz said. It sits in the Hope Steven Garden, on West 142nd Street between Amsterdam Avenue and Hamilton Place.\nNeighbors had actually complained to Ms. Cockcroft, said Ms. Braun-Reinitz, because the mural glossed over the contemporary problems of the crack epidemic. That\u2019s when Ms. Cockcroft moved her ladder across the street, the story goes, and painted \u201cPush Crack Back,\u201d a mural portraying these concerns. That mural no longer exists.\n\u201cLa Grande Jatte in Harlem\u201d used 18 gallons of paint and 51 brushes \u2014 and cost $70,000. There are 70 colors of paint mixed in the new version and an ultraviolet-resistant varnish. To gauge the effects of weather on the different applications of paint, artists left multiple control layers.\nKudos for restoring this very fine mural. It\u2019s not stated in the article \u2013 did the restorer\u2019s take steps to protect this version as much as possible given it\u2019s outdoors location?\nI am reminded that around the same time \u2013 someone painted as a wall m"}

{"idx": "35245", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: You have often heard about \u2018yield\u2019 on bonds, stocks or mutual fund units but may have probably wondered what it means and what does it signify. Simply put, yield is the return on investment in the form of dividend or interest income and it is expressed as an annualised percentage based on the cost price, face value or current market price of the investment.\nThe yield on a stock or a mutual fund (MF) scheme is expressed as \u2018dividend yield\u2019, while the yield on bonds is expressed in terms of \u2018interest yield\u2019 (or \u2018bond yield\u2019). The dividend yield can be calculated based on cost (acquisition) price or the current market price (CMP). For example, if the cost price of a stock (or MF unit) bought in 2015 was Rs 50 and the dividend for the last financial year is Rs 5 per share (or per MF unit), the dividend yield is 10% (5/50x100=10%). However, if the market price of the stock or MF unit has gone up and it is currently quoting at Rs 55, the dividend yield on the CMP would be 9.09% approx. If the shares or MF units were bought in an IPO or NFO at Rs 10, the dividend yield would be a whopping 50%.\nIn the case of bonds, the interest (or bond) yield would depend on the coupon rate of the bond and the current market price of the bond. The coupon rate is the rate of interest fixed at the time of issuance of the bond. Since the interest rate on the bond remains fixed, any fluctuation in the market interest rates affects the bond yield positively or negatively. For example, if the coupon rate of bond is 10% and the current market price of the bond (with issue price of Rs 100) is Rs 103, the bond yield on the CMP would be 9.7% approx.\nHowever, if the interest rates go up, the bondholder would be at a disadvantage as the coupon rate on the bond remains the same. As a result, the price of the bond would fall to maintain the same return yielded by prevailing interest rates. In the above example, the bond price would have to decline to Rs 101 to maintain the interest yield at 9.90% approx."}

Up to seven players can jam together on guitar, bass, drums, three vocal parts and a new instrument \u2014 the keyboards.\nWith the full band assembled, you\u2019ll be able to rock bombastic tunes like Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d and The Doors\u2019 \u201cBreak on Through.\u201d But in the new Pro mode, Rock Band 3 really blurs the line between videogame diversion and musicianship.

New controllers make guitars and drums more realistic, too.\nRock Band 3 will be shown in its full glory at next week\u2019s E3 Expo in Los Angeles, but I got to try it for myself last month at a private demonstration. Bottom line: Rock Band 3 is a game that stays faithful to its core conceit of making music accessible and fun for all, while evolving in multiple exciting directions.\nThe new Rock Band 3 keyboard peripheral can be played sitting down or standing up.\nAll of Rock Band 3 \u2018s instruments will be manufactured by Mad Catz, including the new keytar, a two-octave controller about the size of an old-school Casiotone. We played it on a keyboard stand, but you can totally rock the keytar over your shoulder with a strap if you want.\nI tried out \u201cThe Power of Love\u201d by Huey Lewis and the News, but wasn\u2019t brave or skilled enough to tackle Pro mode keys. Playing keyboards in normal mode reduces the gameplay to five color-coded sections. As long as your hands are in the right general area of the keyboard, you\u2019ll hit the notes.\nPro mode drumming isn\u2019t any easier than in previous versions of the game. I got distracted by the new cymbal symbols cruising down the note highway \u2014 luckily we were playing with the no-fail option turned on.\nIf you\u2019re already a great Rock Band drummer, you should have no problem conforming to the new demands of mandatory cymbal play. But if you\u2019re like me and only ride the hi-hats for fun, there\u2019s a whole new level of challenge to playing drums this way.\nGuitar is where Pro mode really gets insane. To play a guitar track on this setting, you\u2019ll need the new Fender Mustang Pro Guitar controller, which simulates the playing of six strings and 17 frets with a whole array of buttons on the neck.\nAlso, you need to be a savant. Pro mode guitars weren\u2019t available for our hands-on experience, but we saw a video of the Dio tune \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d and it looked damn near impossible \u2014 like trying to read tab notation on a piano roll going a hundred miles an hour.\nRock Band 3 's Pro mode makes playing virtual instruments identical to playing real ones.\nBut then, nobody\u2019s expected to be able to sight-read the Pro guitar tracks. It\u2019s meant for actual students of the guitar.

They'll cheer for teens in tuxedos and gowns while an announcer reads what the students will do once they leave this pecan grove skyline.\nEarlier this month, Wilcox County High School senior Mareshia Rucker rode to a historic theater in the nearby town of Fitzgerald to see her own classmates' prom celebration. She never left the car, even to catch up with her friends. She'd recently helped to invite the critical gaze of the world to her county; few would be happy to see her there, she said. Besides, she's black and wasn't invited to this prom reserved for white students anyway.\nFor as long as most remember, Wilcox County High School hasn't sponsored a prom for its 400 students. Instead, parents and their children organize their own private, off-site parties, known casually as white prom and black prom - a vestige of racial segregation that still lives on.\n\"When people say that seeing is believing, it truly is,\" Mareshia says a few days later from the comfortable bustle of her family's kitchen, central command for the three generations that share it.\n\"Just talking about it, it didn't hurt my feelings. I didn't care,\" she says. \"When I saw it, I felt really crappy. I didn't understand what was so different about me and them.\"\nShe apologizes as her eyes grow shiny and tears dribble down her face. Toni Rucker swoops in to fold her arms around her oldest daughter.\n\"What is the difference,\" she murmurs, Mareshia's head resting on her chest. \"There is no difference.\"\nMareshia and her friends bucked 40 years of local customs this month by organizing their own integrated prom, a formal dance open to Wilcox County's white, black, Latino and Asian high school students. Organizers, both black and white, said they lost friends in the process - a grim experience in the waning weeks of the school year. It's been hard on the rest of their hometown, too.\nWhen the story erupted on TV and social media, Wilcox County became a symbol of race relations stuck in the past. People around the world heard about the sneers from some classmates, the silence from some adults, the school board that says it supports them but didn't sponsor its own prom. Thousands lashed out at the old tradition or offered up kind words, cash, dresses, a DJ. Stunned, they wanted to know, could this be true?

Designed with video and two-way audio communication ability, the drone would relay first-aid instructions to somebody who is nearby.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had missing persons.

And though he did seem to go on and on, to emerge and then re-emerge from periods of silence to comment, always with rigor, and often bitingly, on events of the day, mostly in Granma\u2013occasionally reprinted here in Counterpunch\u2013he was old enough that an end had to arrive one day soon.\nAnd why not now, as the planet surges towards disaster on so many fronts, most of which he foresaw and called upon us to avoid? The end looks to be closing in and while we can\u2019t know the future, it surely isn\u2019t a bad time to slip out if your opus is complete, if you have given your all and made your contribution.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think there is any question about Fidel\u2019s contribution, his dedication to humanity, his brilliance. True: Cuba is not paradise. It is not perfect. But we might well ask, sitting here in the heart of darkness: compared to what? Fidel and his fellow revolutionaries held aloft a vision of what might be, of a national community that values its members and their lives, not simply with words, but with toil, with sacrifice, with action. And they worked against the odds (as well as the US embargo) to bring together vision and reality in their own country, to support that movement in other countries, and to carry the visionary torch for those of us who have needed to hope that humanity contained the essential goodness required to redeem itself.\nFidel was a luminary, and he inspired more lives than can ever be known or counted. Some are well-documented, like this century\u2019s exciting roster of South American leaders on the left. Like Nelson Mandela. But perhaps just as important, there are untold little lives, quiet lives, ones that will never be recorded or remembered, which were changed in fundamental ways by Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution.\nSuch as the 60-year-old taxi driver who drove me from Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport to La Habana. He told me that he was twelve at the time of the revolution, with no shoes, no food, and no prospect of education. His spoke of his great love and loyalty to the revolution, and to Fidel, for bringing him these profound but simple necessities, for changing the course of his life. Or the elderly black woman whose stately home in the Vedado section of the city was assigned to her specifically because of Castro\u2019s aggressive program to balance racial disparity amongst Cubans. She had never thought to have her own house, much less one that made her feel proud, one that made her feel she really belonged. My young African American daughters breathed in the air of her self-assurance and dignity, and they carried some of it away within themselves.\nCastro\u2019s net was cast wide, reaching people all over the world. International Cuban humanitarian and medical missions, for instance, are fairly well-known even in the US, and have saved and improved countless lives on several continents. Ambassadors of Cuban culture and the arts\u2014most notably music, dance, and literature\u2013spread joy and beauty far beyond the island\u2019s shores. Cuba\u2019s political and tactical support for liberation struggles played an important role in ending apartheid and overthrowing colonial rule in a number of nations.\nBut he found his way into unexpected and unsuspecting hearts and minds as well.

In so doing they had failed to scratch below the surface into a world of zero-hours contracts, underemployment and unreliable incomes, he said, as the ILO released research showing a rise in such non-standard forms of employment.\n\u201cThe societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are getting a raw deal,\u201d Ryder told the Guardian.\nSpeaking days after Trump stunned the world with his victory over Hillary Clinton, the ILO chief highlighted the common ground between the Republican candidate\u2019s supporters and those who voted for the UK to leave the EU.\n\u201cIt is the people who feel they haven\u2019t benefited from globalisation and from the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard,\u201d he said.\nThe ILO\u2019s mandate centres on ensuring what it calls \u201cdecent work\u201d. But based on its own findings, the UN agency is facing an uphill battle. Casual forms of work more common in the developing world are being replicated in advanced economies \u2013 the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2013 as on-demand services such as Uber and Deliveroo grow.\nThe ILO report published on Monday finds temporary work, agency work, precarious self-employment and other non-standard forms of employment have become more widespread.\nOn the ground, that translates into downward pressure on earnings, unreliable working hours and lower access to workplace benefits.\nIt comes back to the \u201craw deal\u201d that Ryder talks about.\n\u201cIf you count somebody on a zero-hours contract as being in work that helps the headline figures. If you look at their life you know that it is not the type of quality, decent work that I think we are all pursuing,\u201d says Ryder, who has headed the ILO since 2012, having started his career at the TUC in Britain.\nHis comments reflect the tendency among ministers to focus on record employment levels and falling unemployment, while largely ignoring that wages have stagnated, people have felt pressured into self-employment and millions say they want to work more hours than they can get.\nRyder believes the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU should be a wake-up call.\n\u201cIf you take Brexit vote as a faithful reflection of the mood of people, it is not an expression of contentment and satisfaction with a full employment, \u2018I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m getting ahead\u2019, workforce.

This can be requested by the buyer, seller or their Realtor.\nFor example, if the buyer and seller are negotiating the price and find themselves $10,000 apart, and the agent\u2019s commission is $30,000 on each side, taking $5,000 off each agent\u2019s commission could save the transaction.\nThe sellers are happy because their home is now in escrow, the buyers are happy because they now have the home they want in escrow, and the Realtors are happy because they now have a $25,000 commission coming to them versus nothing.\nI have seen this suggested by sellers, suggested by buyers and sometimes as agents, we suggest it. It is not something we do on a regular basis. We try to let the buyer and seller come to terms without a commission reduction, but when all else fails, it is a great way to save the deal.\nUnfortunately, I have seen some strong negative feelings from some agents about this.\nFor example, in one situation the seller suggested he would take the offer if the buyer\u2019s agent would lower the commission to match what we were getting paid. The total commission the seller was offering to the buyer\u2019s agent was $50,000, which in my opinion is a lot of money.\nHowever, the buyer\u2019s agent was so upset at the idea of reducing commission that he threatened to file an ethics claim. After investigating it with some experts, it was determined that what the seller was doing was perfectly acceptable, and there were no ethics issues involved.\nThe bottom line was we were still in negotiations, and everything could be negotiated, including the commissions.\nI was shocked at the buyer\u2019s agent response. Right now, if the average home price in the U.S. is $188,900; at 3 percent, the commission to an agent would be $5,667.\nSo, to me, an agent being so furious at being offered almost 10 times the average commission was surprising. Had the property cost a lot less they would have ended up with less commission and been 100 percent satisfied, yet the work involved would be roughly the same.\nIn another situation, the seller negotiated the commission right up front by saying in the MLS he would pay $100,000 to the buyer\u2019s agent for a home listed at $5,450,000.\nI was shocked when one agent said that some buyer\u2019s agents might not show the property with this reduced commission. Yes, the commission was substantially less than the standard 3 percent, but $100,000 is a huge commission that I believe most agents would be very happy to receive.\nIn my opinion, this type of attitude about the commission is a real black eye on our industry. We must be very careful with this attitude too.\nIn 2005 the National Association of Realtors was sued by the Department of Justice for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Here is the settlement summary as displayed on the United States Department of Justice Website.\nMentioning that agents won\u2019t show a property because of a reduced commission seems to go against the spirit of the NAR settlement.\nSo, there you have it. There can be an agreement to change the commission.\nPlease keep this in mind the next time you have a deal where the seller and buyer are close, but can\u2019t quite reach an"}

The Cardinal have now lost four of their last five games.\nStanford struggled to consistently make stops against an energized Bears side. Cal shot a tremendous 53.7 percent from the field and took 37 free throw attempts as the Stanford defense aggressively fought to contest the Bears\u2019 field goal attempts.\nStanford struggled in particular in the interior, with Cal out-rebounding the Cardinal 41-25 and executing well enough in the pick and roll to drive to the basket seemingly at will. With sophomore Reid Travis still out and sophomore Michael Humphrey leaving the game in the first half with an injury, backup bigs Josh Sharma and Grant Verhoeven struggled to pick up the slack, both fouling out early in the second half.\nCal\u2019s best offense came from the bench, with junior Jordan Mathews leading all scorers with 18 points and sophomore Kameron Rooks chiming in with a double-double. The team finished 9-of-17 from the 3-point line, a statistic which in some respects understates its proficiency given that it made just one of its final five attempts when the game\u2019s outcome had largely been decided.\nSenior Rosco Allen finished with 16 points for Stanford, all of which came in the second half, while sophomore Dorian Pickens joined him in double figures with 10. The team\u2019s offensive struggles were in stark contrast to when the teams met a month ago, when Stanford topped its rival 77-71 and had four different players score at least 11 points.\nThe loss puts Stanford on a three-game losing streak, its longest since it fell consecutively to Villanova, SMU and Saint Mary\u2019s in November, and breaks a four-game Cardinal winning streak over its archrival that dated back to Jan. 2, 2014.\nStanford will now return home for a series against Oregon and Oregon State.

But he retired from the Senate, after being defeated for re-election by John Thune, as a multimillionaire. He retired to Georgetown, of course, not to South Dakota. This happens a lot in Washington, and Daschle\u2019s case is pretty typical.\nHis wife Linda is or was a lobbyist, and she was the one who reported the family\u2019s income. (This is inference, since Daschle consistently chose not to make his tax returns public.) Linda Daschle made millions \u201clobbying\u201d on behalf of various corporate interests. There was no conflict of interest, the Democrats assured us, because Linda Daschle only \u201clobbied\u201d the House of Representatives, not the Senate, where her husband was either the Majority or the Minority Leader for much of his career.\nBut wait! If a company hired Linda to lobby House members, the check they wrote went straight into the Senate Majority Leader\u2019s joint checking account. It would have been a felony to write the check to Tom in exchange for political services, but a check to Linda, that went into the same bank account? No problem! She wasn\u2019t lobbying the Senate! So Tom Daschle became a multimillionaire.\nFormer Sen. Tom Daschle, picked by President Barack Obama to lead the administration\u2019s health reform efforts, recently filed amended tax returns to report $128,203 in unpaid taxes and $11,964 in interest, according to a Senate document obtained by The Associated Press.\nThe White House acknowledged Friday that \u201csome tax issues\u201d had emerged in connection with the nomination, but a spokesman said the president is confident the former Senate Democratic leader will be confirmed as the new health secretary.\nThe principal issues that Daschle is now rectifying with the IRS stem from his relationship with InterMedia Advisors of Englewood, Colo. Daschle is a limited partner and chairman of that firm\u2019s executive advisory board, and is also an independent consultant to InterMedia Advisors LLP of New York City.\nInterMedia Advisors was founded by Leo Hindery, who, as we noted here, was once the CEO of Global Crossing, a company that enriched a number of prominent Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe, but also turned into one of the biggest bankruptcies in the history of American business, in which creditors and innocent investors lost many millions of dollars. Hindery subsequently ran for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, served on the Board of Advisors of left-wing Democracy Radio, and was awarded the \u201cOates-Shrum Leadership Award of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund.\u201d In his spare time, he\u2019s been funneling cash to Daschle.\nIs Tom Daschle a crook, or is it fairer to think of him as a low-level tool of various big-time crooks who play the Washington game by the corrupt rules of the Democratic Party? Either way, it is hard to think of a worse person to put in charge of \u201creforming\u201d the nation\u2019s health care system.\nStill, there is always a silver lining. One good thing about electing a Democrat as President is that, as he nominates fellow Democrats to senior positions in the Executive Branch, millions of dollars in unpaid tax liabilities come to light and are belatedly paid to the IRS, with interest. It is, perhaps, the most tangible advantage of electing Democrats to office.\nUPDATE: Michelle Malkin has more."}

Negotiators intend to use that time to come up with a more comprehensive, permanent deal to ensure that Iran\u2019s nuclear program will only be used for peaceful purposes, not weapons-making.\nThe accord was signed in Geneva at 3 a.m. today. It requires Iran, which has long avoided international monitoring of its nuclear program, to stop enriching uranium beyond five percent, which is enough to produce energy. The country\u2019s current stockpile of uranium enriched at twenty percent, which is close to the level needed to build a bomb, is to be diluted or converted so that it can\u2019t be used for military purposes. Iran also agreed to curb the capabilities of the centrifuges it uses to enrich uranium and to not build new enrichment facilities.\nIn exchange, Iran will receive $6 to $7 billion in relief from the sanctions that have crippled the country\u2019s economy.

{"idx": "35283", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Proliferation Intelligence or Proliferation of Intelligence?\nThe one constant in American history is that government bureaucracies grow and proliferate rather than shrink and dwindle. Despite its secrecy \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 the intelligence community is no exception.\nAfter 9/11, changing over to fight against small, nimble terrorist groups, instead of the massive, ossified bureaucracies of communist countries, was said to require the proliferation of new intelligence organizations. Of course, the giant new Department of Homeland Security had to have its own intelligence arm. That organization then joined the 14 other intelligence agencies in being rolled up and put under a new Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Fighting more agile terrorists would seem to argue for streamlining agencies and making them talk to each other better \u2014 remember, lack of coordination and communication between the intelligence bureaucracies was what allowed information on the impending 9/11 attacks to go unnoticed and un-acted upon. In 9/11\u2019s wake, however, the solution to poor coordination and communication was to make it worse by throwing additional organizations into the mix.\nDuring the subsequent Iraq War, the George W. Bush administration didn\u2019t feel the CIA adequately recognized the threat from Saddam Hussein and his alleged weapons of mass destruction, so it created a new and then-controversial intelligence office in the Pentagon to come up with scarier threat information. This was later disbanded because of congressional and public concern.\nBut the Pentagon, which already controls 80% of the intelligence budget, continues its quest to grab even more of the pie. Recently, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has created a new Defense Clandestine Service to improve the department\u2019s human intelligence capabilities. The service was born out of a study in 2011 by the director of national intelligence, which concluded that although the Defense Intelligence Agency was fulfilling its mission of providing intelligence to the military in war zones, it needed to collect more \u201cnational intelligence\u201d outside the battlefield to share with its sister intelligence agencies. For example, intelligence on terrorists and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction might fall into this category. So would general intelligence on Iran and China \u2014 being sold by the government as the threats of the future.\nThus, the military and CIA are increasingly focused on similar threats. In fact, one high-level Pentagon official quoted in The New York Times argued that the new Defense Clandestine Service would \u201cthicken our coverage across the board\u201d but then tried to alleviate concerns that the new organization would take over the function of the CIA or its National Clandestine Service. He\u2019s right: the new entity will not take over the CIA\u2019s function; it will begin to duplicate it. Now, the Defense Clandestine Service is small, but as with all government organizations, we can count on it to grow and turf wars with the CIA\u2019s service to ensue.\nWill all the new spooks running around make us safer? Given the plethora of historical coordination failures among intelligence agencies from Pearl Harbor down to the present, it\u2019s doubtful. To justify the proliferation of bureaucracies, intelligence personnel usually tout \u201ccompetition\u201d among agencies to provide the best intelligence. However, unlike private companies, which are out to make money, government agencies just want to increase their budgets and number of employees.

Choosing this city as the venue for the summit is a big security and political gamble for Angela Merkel. But Hamburg is the chancellor's hometown, and she is trying to show the world that protests are tolerated in a democracy.\nWaves and boats ferrying passengers across the Elbe River are the sounds typically associated with this northern port city - not this week, though, as authorities try to secure Hamburg before the summit begins.\nNELSON: ...Many of them with dogs sniffing for explosives and helping to keep order. German officials are concerned about the prospect of an Islamist terror attack given the many recent incidents across Europe. They are also determined to prevent anti-G-20 demonstrations from turning violent. And police have been quick to use force to break up gatherings at the first sign of trouble as they did tonight. Nor were area business owners taking any chances.\nNELSON: Many put up plywood to protect their store fronts from the clashes between demonstrators and police. Fifteen square miles of downtown have also been declared off-limits to anyone not connected to the summit.\nNELSON: Public transit drivers warned of areas that were closed to passengers, but Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz denied the authorities were being heavy handed.\nNELSON: He told German public broadcaster ARD the city has agreed to allow nearly 30 demonstrations to go ahead. He says holding summits in some out-of-the-way location as is usually the case isn't as democratic as holding it in a liberal city like Hamburg. He says it's important for the 20 most powerful leaders in the world to get together and to tackle pressing global issues like climate change, free trade and aid for developing countries. But his assurances weren't stopping many Hamburg residents from leaving, like this 61-year-old doctor's assistant at the Central Train Station who said she was too frightened to give her name.\nNELSON: \"I find the city's atmosphere threatening,\" the woman says, adding she worries there will be a rampage. She says she and her husband moved up their vacation to escape the G-20, but they first had to make it past hundreds of protesters who had just arrived by chartered train from Switzerland.\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in foreign language).\nNELSON: Scores of police in riot gear were on hand to vet the out-of-towners. Thousands more Hamburg residents are protesting against the summit, too, like this group that carry posters denouncing Donald Trump.\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: My body, my choice.\nUNIDENTIFIED MEN: Her body, her choice.\nNELSON: None of the residents I interviewed were happy Trump was here, nor did they think his talks with Merkel, let alone the G-20, would change anything.

It's often a broom or mop handle with dozens of beer caps, small bells and other noisemakers attached, a tin can on top and, sometimes, a boot on the bottom for stability as it's played with a drumstick.\nMummering is a blend of traditions believed to have migrated to Newfoundland from England and Ireland early in the 19th century.\nAlso known as mumming or janneying, it generally works like this: groups of relatives or friends decked out in costumes knock on the door of a neighbour's house.\nThey ask something such as, \"Mummers allowed in?\" And, if welcomed, the hosts try to guess their visitors' identities before serving drinks and food.\nGender-bending dress and talking while inhaling are some of the tricks used to throw off the guessers. Mummers have also been known to dance a jig or play a tune as part of the game.\nIt's a tradition that fascinates people from outside the province, said Dale Jarvis, a folklorist at the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador.\nThe foundation revitalized the mummers parade three years ago and has since watched it take on a life of its own.\n\"The first year we ran the parade, we had a fellow who flew in from Nova Scotia,\" Jarvis said. \"He had read about it online and wanted to experience it for himself.\"\nRyan Davis is leading this year's event, set for Dec. 17. He expects it to be even bigger than the last parade which drew about 350 mummers.\n\"I'm anticipating a really big increase this year,\" he said, based on inquiries and interest.\nMummering is a great leveller that, for a short time, frees people from the constraints of age, income and gender while they're in disguise, Davis said.\n\"It's just a lot of fun.\"\nGaylynne Lambert, a marketing and events co-ordinator with Downtown St. John's, has never spent Christmas away from the city.\n\"I couldn't,\" she said. \"Christmas is the one time of year that we all make a point to get together in one group,\" the youngest of six kids said of her brothers, sisters, nine nieces and nephews.\n\"There's tons of stuff going on,\" she added, rhyming off a heady list of holiday concerts featuring popular traditional, rock and folk musicians.\nA classical favourite is the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra's yearly rendition of Handel's \"Messiah\" at the soaring St. John's Basilica.

NASA\u2019s Mars Orbiter crashed because engineers forgot to convert to metric measurements; JPMorgan Chase\u2019s \u201cLondon Whale\u201d venture went bad in part because modelers divided by a sum instead of an average. So, did an Excel coding error destroy the economies of the Western world?\nThe story so far: At the beginning of 2010, two Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, circulated a paper, \u201cGrowth in a Time of Debt,\u201d that purported to identify a critical \u201cthreshold,\u201d a tipping point, for government indebtedness. Once debt exceeds 90 percent of gross domestic product, they claimed, economic growth drops off sharply.\nMs. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff had credibility thanks to a widely admired earlier book on the history of financial crises, and their timing was impeccable. The paper came out just after Greece went into crisis and played right into the desire of many officials to \u201cpivot\u201d from stimulus to austerity. As a result, the paper instantly became famous; it was, and is, surely the most influential economic analysis of recent years.\nIn fact, Reinhart-Rogoff quickly achieved almost sacred status among self-proclaimed guardians of fiscal responsibility; their tipping-point claim was treated not as a disputed hypothesis but as unquestioned fact. For example, a Washington Post editorial earlier this year warned against any relaxation on the deficit front, because we are \u201cdangerously near the 90 percent mark that economists regard as a threat to sustainable economic growth.\u201d Notice the phrasing: \u201ceconomists,\u201d not \u201csome economists,\u201d let alone \u201csome economists, vigorously disputed by other economists with equally good credentials,\u201d which was the reality.\nFor the truth is that Reinhart-Rogoff faced substantial criticism from the start, and the controversy grew over time. As soon as the paper was released, many economists pointed out that a negative correlation between debt and economic performance need not mean that high debt causes low growth. It could just as easily be the other way around, with poor economic performance leading to high debt. Indeed, that\u2019s obviously the case for Japan, which went deep into debt only after its growth collapsed in the early 1990s.\nOver time, another problem emerged: Other researchers, using seemingly comparable data on debt and growth, couldn\u2019t replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results. They typically found some correlation between high debt and slow growth \u2014 but nothing that looked like a tipping point at 90 percent or, indeed, any particular level of debt.\nIn response, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff have acknowledged the coding error, defended their other decisions and claimed that they never asserted that debt necessarily causes slow growth. That\u2019s a bit disingenuous because they repeatedly insinuated that proposition even if they avoided saying it outright. But, in any case, what really matters isn\u2019t what they meant to say, it\u2019s how their work was read: Austerity enthusiasts trumpeted that supposed 90 percent tipping point as a proven fact and a reason to slash government spending even in the face of mass unemployment.\nSo the Reinhart-Rogoff fiasco needs to be seen in the broader context of austerity mania: the obviously intense desire of policy makers, politicians and pundits across the Western world to turn their backs on the unemployed and instead use the economic crisis as an excuse to slash social programs.\nWhat the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which a"}

Randy Smith, R-Tucker, introduced Senate Bill 522 on Tuesday. Smith has risen on multiple occasions to address his fellow senators to warn about the dangers of crumbling pavement, potholes the size of cars and clogged ditches creating mini rivers and washing away roads.\nSmith has an aggressive plan to spur secondary road repair on a statewide scale with SB 522. It would create a Special Road Repair Fund.\nTo develop that fund, the bill first would take 2 percent of the 5 percent severance tax revenue from coal and natural gas. Second, it would take $200 million from the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund.\n\u201cI know a lot of people are going to be against the $200 million from the Rainy Day Fund, but if we have surpluses going to be going in there, let\u2019s take it out immediately and replace it as we go and solve the problem,\u201d Smith said.\nThe bill calls for a Road Maintenance Program, which would require the West Virginia Division of Highways to bid ditching, snow removal and mowing work it cannot complete.\nSB 522 also would create a think tank at the Division of Highways.\nThe think tank, comprised of the commissioner of highways and highways employees, would develop ways to better maintain and repair state roads.\nHouse Majority Leader Amy Summers, R-Taylor, has a couple of bills also aimed at freeing resources at the Division of Highways to fix secondary roads and keep an eye on the tax dollars spent by the highways department.\nThe first of Summers\u2019 bills, House Bill 2011, is similar to a section of Smith\u2019s bill requiring the DOH offices to contract with private firms to handle specific kinds of maintenance activities. Summers\u2019 bill, though, adds caveats.\n\u201cWe do not, however, want the state to be gouged, so we will set that the bid cannot exceed what the Division of Highways would pay to have that work done,\u201d Summers said.\nAnother bill from Summers, HB 2012, would create the Country Roads Accountability and Transparency act.

{"idx": "35309", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Perhaps Toronto police should heed their own advice and look both ways before they talk.\nWell-intentioned though the force's Pedestrian Safety Blitz may be, it is a misguided and paternalistic exercise doomed to failure. The program, launched Wednesday after a rash of pedestrian deaths across the GTA, is flawed in its understanding of how people actually make their way through the city.\nDespite what the police would have us believe, we are all jaywalkers. We have no choice; to negotiate the city on foot requires endless street crossing without benefit of traffic light, crosswalk or corner.\nThe police are now stopping jaywalkers and other pedestrians whose behaviour they don't like to hand out tickets and deliver a lecture on street safety. It's for our own good, of course. Pedestrians are naughty children who must be protected from themselves.\nAnd sometimes we do need to be protected from ourselves. Anyone who saunters into the path of an oncoming streetcar while engrossed in a cellphone conversation is asking for trouble.\nBut the reality of jaywalking is quite the opposite. In fact, jaywalking can be much safer than crossing at a green light, corner or crosswalk.\nThat might sound counterintuitive, but the reason is simple: Jaywalkers assume nothing; those crossing legally assume everything.\nPedestrians at a green light take it for granted that vehicles will come to a stop, that drivers turning right or left will see them, and that their right-of-way will be respected. As we know, it's not.\nBy contrast, jaywalkers look both ways, wait for a break in the traffic and often make eye contact with drivers before proceeding.\nThe concept of \"naked streets,\" or as the Dutch call them, woonerfs, is based on the same principle. Because street signs have been removed, drivers and pedestrians are forced to pay close attention to each other. Fewer accidents result.\nNo one should hold their breath waiting for naked streets to appear in Toronto; that's never going to happen. On the other hand, it would be worth employing a bit more subtlety and intelligence than the police have managed. Imposing fines and wagging fingers will accomplish nothing. Deaths will continue.\nAnd let's not forget that the majority of the 14 pedestrians killed by drivers in the last few weeks were doing exactly what the law stipulated. They weren't jaywalking, though they might have been better off had that been the case.\nThe police response, which is to blame the victim, misses the point and reinforces tired old prejudices against pedestrians.\nIn recent days, officers have been telling Toronto pedestrians that it doesn't matter if they are in the right; cars are bigger and go faster. But, they remind us, it's pedestrians who get killed, not drivers.\nThat may be true, but one wonders whether the argument would hold if, for example, we were talking about domestic violence. Husbands tend to be bigger and stronger, so if you're a woman, just stay out of their way. Highly unlikely.\nNot all pedestrian deaths are the drivers' fault, but that's not the point. The issue is that we don't share the roads. Simply banning pedestrians from the streets, as the police would like, might please drivers, but even they must occasionally climb out from behind the wheel.\nWe have learned not to expect too much from the police, but their handling of the pedestrian deaths has revealed a force well behind the times.\n\""}

For many, the diagnoses meant radical changes to the way they lived their lives. One patient even killed himself.\nMost of the patients began seeking treatment at the clinic, which opened in 2015, after suffering from a traumatic brain injury or experiencing some other kind of cognitive decline. Its owner, Sherry-Ann Jenkins, offered a \u201cholistic\u201d approach to treatment that included memory games and daily spoonfuls of coconut oil. But it turned out Jenkins, who has a doctorate degree in physiological science but not a medical license, was not authorized to order medical tests or dole out diagnoses and treatment. Nonetheless, Jenkins ordered up imaging tests and made diagnoses based on the scans that turned out to be inaccurate. And her husband, a doctor, signed off on tests despite never actually seeing any of the patients.\nIn response, patients took vacations, spent more time with family and quit jobs, all living their lives under the assumption that life as they knew it would soon change. Eventually, though, second opinions confirmed for patients that their newfound reality was completely false. Lawsuits against the clinic have been accumulating over the past year, with each individual plaintiff seeking more than a million in damages.\nThe clinic, which closed last year, was part of Toledo Clinic, a multi-specialty medical center with more than 150 doctors. Patients are also suing the Toledo Clinic, alleging it should have known Jenkins did not have the training and credentials necessary to treat and diagnose patients.\nIn legal responses to the patient lawsuits, lawyers for the clinic did not dispute that Jenkins was unlicensed but denied most of the other allegations. So far, there have been no criminal charges against Jenkins, and it is unclear whether there will be."}

The party\u2019s House candidates have savaged Nancy Pelosi for passing (fictional) cuts to Medicare benefits, while President Trump recently \u201cwrote\u201d a column on liberals\u2019 insidious plan to take government health care away from the elderly by giving it to everyone else.\nThis was always going to be a tricky gambit for the GOP. Simply put, it\u2019s hard to convince people that they can only trust you to protect their entitlement benefits, when you\u2019re also arguing that taxes must never be raised; military spending must never be cut; and the budget deficit is a threat to our grandchildren.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed rising federal deficits and debt on a bipartisan unwillingness to contain spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and said he sees little chance of a major deficit reduction deal while Republicans control Congress and the White House.\nOn one level, McConnell\u2019s disingenuousness is obvious \u2014 so much so, that Bloomberg gently undermines the Majority Leader\u2019s claim to fiscal probity by highlighting the Trump tax cuts\u2019 impact on the deficit (last year, McConnell claimed to believe that his $1.5 trillion tax package would actually pay for itself).\nBut McConnell\u2019s broader narrative is superficially plausible; and has, in fact, been the common-sense view among \u201cobjective\u201d beltway pundits and reporters for some time now. Which is to say: A lot of very serious people believe that cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits is a fiscal necessity \u2014 but a political nightmare \u2014 and thus, both parties have a moral responsibility to unite in opposition to the plebians\u2019 wishes, and take money out of the pockets of the old and infirm.\nBloomberg\u2019s article does little to contest these assumptions. And yet, they\u2019re no more credible than McConnell\u2019s insistence that cutting Charles Koch\u2019s taxes increases federal revenues.\nThe claim that Medicare and Social Security are unsustainable \u2014 as a matter of simple demographic and fiscal math \u2014 proceeds from (at least) four false premises.\n1) America\u2019s current levels of public debt are dangerous and unsustainable.\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, the United States decided to prioritize economic stimulus over deficit reduction (over Mitch McConnell\u2019s furious objections); most of Europe took the opposite tack. Time has vindicated the Keynesians.\nOver the past decade, the U.S. has put well over $10 trillion on the national credit card \u2014 and bought ourselves rates of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation that have been the envy of the Western world. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to push through another round of deficit-financed stimulus \u2014 near the ostensible peak of an expansion \u2014 was widely derided as irresponsible. And certainly, the regressive structure of his stimulus was lamentable; but the decision to forgo belt-tightening is looking pretty good. Running the economy hot has pushed the unemployment rate down near record lows, while bringing many Americans back into the labor force, and thus, increasing our economy\u2019s productive capacity.

The new design language, which Subaru is calling \"Dynamic x Solid,\" features a more chunky look undoubtedly intended to appeal to the weekend adventurer types who refuse to allow urban or suburban living to put a damper on their outdoorsy lifestyles.\nSubaru's \"Dynamic x Solid\" design language for the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek features chunkier styling aimed at outdoorsy adventurers.\nSubaru's cars\u2014and the Crosstrek in particular\u2014may not be fancy, but standard all-wheel drive, good handling, decent fuel economy, and a reputation for reliability keep people coming back for more. This is especially true in regions like the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest, where brutish winter weather can put a serious damper on one\u2019s ability to get from point A to point B in a car of inferior capability.\nThe 2018 Subaru Crosstrek is essentially a crossover\u2019s crossover. Because it is essentially a Subaru Impreza hatchback in an SUV costume, it's more carlike than a crossover while sitting up higher than the vehicle on which it is based. It's a good option for potential car buyers who want a little extra utility and ground clearance combined with AWD, but don't want the handling and fuel efficiency compromises inherent in taller, heavier crossovers.\nIn mid-level 2.0i Premium trim, the 2018 Crosstrek comes with cloth upholstery.\nThe quality of the materials Subaru uses in the 2018 Crosstrek\u2019s interior leaves something to be desired. The driver and passengers are surrounded by cheap black plastic, the worst of which is an awful-looking faux-carbon fiber accent strip slapped onto the doors and dashboard.\nAt first, I was really taken aback by the cheesiness of it, but when I considered the car's low price and the fact that the people most likely to buy it would be roughing up the interior with outdoor performance gear (or OPG, as I like to call it) on a regular basis, the interior's old-school Spartan quality started to make more sense.\nFortunately, the seats are comfortable and there's plenty of legroom in both the front and rear rows. The mid-level 2.0i Premium model I tested came with black cloth seats that, while not luxurious in appearance, featured sporty orange piping around the seating surfaces. The top-of-the-line 2.0i Limited, which starts $3,300 higher in price than the mid-level 2.0i Premium model, comes with leather upholstery as well as a more robust technology package to justify the price.\nAs it always has, Subaru manages to eke a good amount of interior volume out of a relatively small car. The back seat is roomy, and wide rear doors make for easy entry for passengers and parents bending into the car to attach bulky child safety seats. Spatial generosity doesn't extend behind the rear seats, however.\nAt just under 21 cu.-ft. with the rear seats up, cargo volume isn't great. With the seats folded flat, it jumps up to a more generous 55 cu.-ft. The load floor is a good size for carrying things, but the car"}

{"idx": "35341", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Blair that the Muslim community must work to discredit the extremists who promote violence. However, for this plan to work, Mr. Blair\u2019s own penchant for war, like that of his American counterpart George Bush, must likewise be discredited. If the evil ideology of one party is to be \"pulled up by the roots,\" then the other party is duty-bound to weed its own garden. The stakes are too high to pretend that the violence of one group is acceptable, while that of the other group is not. It\u2019s a matter of logic: If al-Qaeda, in killing the innocent through terrorism in England, is based on an evil ideology, then Tony Blair\u2019s pro-war administration, in killing the innocent through war in Iraq, is likewise based on an evil ideology. These twin ideologies are sides of the same coin.\nTo understand this two-sided coin, it is important first to consider the similarities. Both are designed to kill human beings for some purpose that the leaders of the war or the terrorism consider important. The leaders of both war and terrorism must recruit young people while they are at their most impressionable and their most gullible. In war and in terrorism, young recruits must be trained through some kind of school or boot camp that uses propaganda and mind-control techniques in order to convince them to discard moral prohibitions such as \"Thou shalt not kill.\" Then there is the matter of training the soldiers to sacrifice their safety and even their lives, if necessary, for the \"higher\" cause promoted by their leaders.\nFinally, in both war and terrorism, the young must be given the weaponry with which to kill other people and the spiritual justifications (\"you\u2019ll be rewarded in heaven,\" \"you\u2019re serving your country,\" \"you\u2019ll be a martyr,\" \"you\u2019ll be a hero,\" etc.) necessary for violating lifelong taboos against murder.\nIntentions: Leaders who advocate war and those who carry it out repeatedly market combat by talking about their intentions rather than the consequences of their actions. Phrases such as, \"we never target civilians\" or \"the regrettable loss of life\" serve the function of diverting attention away from the evil that has been perpetrated and onto the good intentions in the war planner\u2019s mind.\nWhen civilians are killed, especially those whose countrymen have the clout to create opposition to the war, specific steps must be taken to give the impression that these \"unfortunate incidents\" were the result of \"rogue individuals\" and thus should not weaken support for the war. When terrorists kill civilians, not only do they not pretend to have taken every measure possible to prevent it, they brag about killing them. Thus terrorist leaders kill civilians and then say they intended to do so, while war leaders kill civilians and then say they didn\u2019t intend to do so.\nNumbers killed: War kills large numbers of people over sustained periods of time, while terrorism kills fewer in brief bursts. A critical consequence of this difference has to do with recruiting potential. By harming vast numbers of individuals, families, and communities for months and years on end, war creates a ripple effect: Hundreds of thousands of people (along with many citizens of neighboring countries) will eventually be aggrieved or enraged by the deaths. Many citizens will thus become susceptible to terrorists\u2019 appeals to \"fight back.\"\nTerrorism, by killing smaller numbers in isolated incidents separated by time, is not, however, effective in terms of recruiting the masses to oppose war, because nationalistic pro-war"}

Wu.\nI won\u2019t bore you to death with the details of his life, as I\u2019ve already done that in numerous posts before. Remember when he likened Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux as having the mind of Lao Tzu, with the heart of Confucius? He\u2019s written some amazing stuff.\nI keep teasing you with the fact that I\u2019m reading Shusaku Endo\u2019s novel, The Samurai. I still haven\u2019t finished it, and I\u2019m still not ready to post on it, but it has gotten me thinking once again of some of my favorite conversion stories. Stories from Asia. The conversion of John C.H. Wu ranks right up there as one of my all-time favorites, for sure.\nI once called him a Chinese Legal Eagle, as he was a very accomplished lawyer and judge. In his first conversion to Christianity, he became a member of the Methodist Episcopal church while studying law at one of their missionary schools (Soochow University) near Shanghai. There is even a Tennessee connection, as that school was headed by one C. W. Rankin who hailed from my home state. Upon graduation from Soochow\u2019s law school, John headed on to the University of Michigan Law School to further his studies. At Michigan, he knocked out his Juris Doctor degree in one year.\nOops, I started boring you with John\u2019s background. Sorry.\nIn his second Christian conversion, he swam the Tiber, see. Following being the Ambassador to the Holy See for the Nationalist Republic of China in 1947-49 (yes, mainland, pre-Communist, China had an ambassador to the Holy See long before the United States did [ahem, 1984] ), he escaped the destruction wrought by Mao\u2019s armies and landed on his feet in the United States, as a professor of law at Seton Hall University.\nWhich is where he was when he wrote the book entitled Fountain of Justice: A Study in the Natural Law (Sheed & Ward, 1955). What follows is a passage from the eighteenth chapter, \u201cThe Fountainhead of Legal Wisdom,\u201d in which John gives us a clinic on the depth and breadth of the impact Christianity has had on the development of law in England, and in the United States.\nThis is one of the best statements on the relation between natural law and human law. Natural law is the common fountain of ethics and jurisprudence. The functions of these latter are different. Each has its forte, and each its limits. The differences and interrelations between law and morals present a fascinating subject of study, but we shall not enter upon it here. All that I wish to say now is that if the law does not require everyone to act as the Good Samaritan, it is not because it is not sufficiently Christian to appreciate the beauty of moral goodness, but rather because it is aware of its own limits, and it has to take account of the frailties of human nature and the actual state of civilization. Jurisprudence would not be prudent if it tried to go beyond the limits of practicability. On the other hand, it would not be just if it did not perform its function as fully as it could within those limits. The end of the law is love, and no measure is set to the end, only to the means. In many matters, the law has to choose the lesser evil.\nOftentimes the legislator or the judge finds himself in the delicate position of that householder"}

Both facilities were included in the infrastructure plan that the council approved in 2014, when it asked voters to approve a hotel-tax increase to pay for infrastructure improvements.\nIn making the case for the new garages, city officials characterized them as one leg in a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d that also includes transportation-demand management (policies that provide incentives for people to switch from cars to other modes of transportation) and technological improvements that increase the capacity of existing garages.\nSeveral residents urged the council on Monday to reconsider its plan for new parking structures and to focus its energies on finding ways to discourage driving.

Increasing burden of gastrointestinal diseases including biliary diseases, esophageal cancer, and colorectal cancer are anticipated to boost the usage of GI stents across the globe.\nIndividuals above 60 years of age form the key target population for these products, as they are at a high risk of developing gastrointestinal and stomach-related diseases. Thus, aging demographics of most of the economies around the globe is a prime factor driving the growth of the sector. Moreover, reimbursement coverage provided by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and various private payers is spurring the adoption of GI stents.\nThe market study suggests that biliary stent dominated the overall sector in 2016. Incidences of biliary diseases such as bile duct cancer, gallstone disease and primary biliary cholangitis are on the rise globally, which would drive the growth of biliary stents sector positively.\nEsophageal stent segment is expected to witness highest growth rate, owing to development of self-expanding plastic stents and self-expanding metal stents, which have proved to be safe and cost-effective for esophageal pathologies.\nApproximately, 50% to 75% of patients who are primarily treated with endoscopic balloon dilation experience recurrence of the structure within 1 year. Such patients are treated with self-expanding metal stents, thereby driving the growth of the market segment.\nNorth America occupied the largest revenue share in 2016, due to the high rate of diagnosing new cases of gastrointestinal diseases and constantly rising awareness regarding commercial availability of effective treatments.\nAsia Pacific is expected to witness a significant growth during the forecast period.

The systems support both Solaris and Linux guest OSes and include all the middleware customers need to run applications, and he said.\nMore Exalogic machines can be strung together for additional power as required, Ellison said.\nAll told, Exalogic is \"one big, honkin' cloud,\" he said. A single setup is capable of handling 1 million HTTP requests per second; two running side-by-side could handle Facebook's HTTP request workload, according to Ellison. \"These are stunning numbers.\"\nEllison sought to provide an Oracle-approved definition of cloud computing in a preamble to the Exalogic announcement.\n\"People use the term to mean very different things. I've actually been very frustrated and outspoken,\" he said, referring obliquely to mocking public remarks he has made. Too many existing technologies have been \"reborn and rebranded cloud computing,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, two well-known examples of cloud computing represent opposite spectrums, he said.\nServices like Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), similar to Exalogic, allow users to run applications on top of an virtualized pool of infrastructure that can shift resources in response to demand.\n\"That's what really gave rise to the term cloud computing. It's elastic, it's virtual, and you only pay for what you use,\" Ellison said.\nIn contrast, a company such as on-demand CRM (customer relationship management) vendor Salesforce.com \"are really one or two applications on the Internet,\" he said. \"They do have a bit of a platform ... for doing little add-ons to their applications.\"\n\"Needless to say, Oracle agrees with Amazon.com,\" Ellison said.

{"idx": "35368", "prompt": "Continue the following text: After his election last Tuesday, new U.S. Congressman Cedric Richmond will join U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu as the only two Democrats in the state\u2019s congressional delegation. On the statewide level, only Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is a Democrat. Just a few years ago, Democrats held a majority of the statewide offices in Louisiana. With the state moving in a conservative direction, Republicans have set their next target: the Louisiana Legislature. With statewide elections set for next year, Republicans will have a chance to claim a majority of legislative seats for the first time since Reconstruction. While the Republicans face a significant hurdle on the Senate side, the Democrats hold only a tiny one seat majority in the House.\nIt is looking bleak for the Louisiana Democratic Party; however, there is a bright spot or two. Along with Richmond\u2019s convincing victory, Lt. Governor candidate Caroline Fayard performed well despite losing her race. She received 43 percent of the vote against a well-respected statewide elected official, Jay Dardenne, who had built significant name recognition. Fayard received more votes than U.S. Senate candidate Charlie Melancon and ran a much better media campaign.\nFayard was practically unknown before the race started, but she made it competitive by spending plenty of her family\u2019s money and receiving a huge influx of cash from the Louisiana Democratic Party. Fayard collected $750,000 from the state party, which likely received much of that money from the Fayard family. In contrast, Dardenne received no assistance from the Louisiana Republican Party. While Fayard was endorsed by leading Louisiana Democrats, Dardenne was not endorsed by Governor Bobby Jindal.\nAs a total newcomer, Fayard impressed many voters as a \u201cfresh face,\u201d but most thought the young attorney was not experienced enough to be elected to a statewide position. Fayard was also hurt by the problem that all Democrats confronted this year, an unpopular President. While the economy was the major concern, voters in Louisiana were also upset with the President because of the oil moratorium and the administration\u2019s slow response to the Gulf oil spill. The overall national political environment was too great a hurdle for Fayard to overcome.\nLooking toward statewide elections in 2011, Fayard is one of the few stars in a decimated Louisiana Democratic Party. To win in Louisiana, a Democrat needs monolithic support from the African American community, along with one-third of the white vote. Fayard may be one of the few Louisiana Democrats who can put that type of coalition together.\nHer race for Lt. Governor is a good start for her political career. In Louisiana, a loss is not necessarily a bad thing for a politician\u2019s career.. Statewide elected officials such as John Kennedy, Jim Donelon, Mary Landrieu and Bobby Jindal all lost statewide races before winning major elections. Fayard has a chance to follow in those footsteps, but only if she positions herself as a moderate to conservative Democrat who is anti-tax, pro-life and pro-gun. It will be interesting to see her next move in the crazy world of Louisiana politics, but I would not be surprised to see her run for statewide office next year."}

Put them together and you're like a freshman, driving the lane against LeBron James. But it can be done -- and here's how I'm doing it (or at least trying to do it).\nThe day my wife gave birth to our son Luke, my professional life of running an ad agency immediately melded with my personal life. We'd recently won the Dove digital business, which was a very big deal for us. I couldn't afford the luxury of taking time off since tending a growing startup -- just like a newborn -- is an \"always on\" gig.\nCase in point: The day Luke was born was the same day we launched our first Dove campaign, and I took conference calls from my wife's hospital room. I know that sounds a bit extreme, but I had a choice to make -- and I chose both. (Those calls from the maternity ward must have won me some brownie points, as we're still going strong with the Dove brand three years later.) Now that my son is already four, the lessons he teaches me are endless. Last year, he watched me string up Christmas lights -- until he decided that it would be more fun to take the box of lights and throw it on the ground to see it smash all over the concrete.\nI was pretty startled, needless to say, and raised my voice: \"LUKE! What did you do?!?\" On cue, Luke ran to his room sobbing, where he promptly buried himself in the corner, crossed his arms and repeated, \"Me mad at you daddy!\"\nIt broke my heart to see how much my five words could affect him. My mind raced 16 years into the future, where I could see Luke telling the Christmas lights story to his parole officer in jail.\nA few days later, as I told the story to a co-worker, it made me think about my staff and how my words affect them, too. Although they don't run to their rooms sobbing, I'm pretty sure I've made a few of them run to their LinkedIn accounts looking for a new job. As parents and as leaders, we sometimes have to take one step back and use a mistake as a teaching moment rather than a scolding one.\nTeaching moments with my son are a lot like my startup career. Luke is now at that age where he says \"Why?\" a lot. It's not enough for me to bark commands like \"Pick up your toys\" or \"Put your rain boots on\" anymore. I have to offer explanations, like, \"Pick up your toys otherwise you'll lose them\" and \"Put your rain boots on so that you don't get sick and wet.\"\nThe same principle applies when we're coming up with campaigns for any of our clients. Our consumers won't buy a product simply because we tell them to; they need to understand why.\nLocation, location, location (it matters). I chose an office space within three miles of my house, which in Los Angeles is unheard of. But this allowed me to easily juggle the 24/7 startup life with the 24/7 life of a parent. I can leave the house, drop off my son at pre-school and be at my office, all within 15 minutes. Working near home is an absolute must.\nHave perspective. It probably goes without saying that becoming a parent puts things into perspective, but perspective is incredibly important for a young startup.

{"idx": "35377", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Exterior plywood is used for sheathing over studs.\nThe application of plywood depends on the manufacturing process. One size doesn't fit all, and there are distinctive differences between interior and exterior plywood -- even if they are not visible. Exterior plywood can be used indoors or outdoors, but interior plywood should never be used outdoors under any circumstances.\nGlue is the differentiating factor in exterior plywood. When the plywood is manufactured for exterior use, waterproof glue is used. It is a resin-based glue similar to the glue used in wooden ships. It dries to a hard, crystal substance that will never yield to moisture of any kind. This glue is applied between every layer of the plywood. Even though the plywood will hold up to almost any weather conditions, it's recommended that some type of paint or finish be used on exterior plywood if it is exposed directly to sun or water.\nWhen purchasing exterior plywood, read the marks on the plywood to identify it. Common plywood markings will have three letters indicating the plywood's application. The most typical marking for exterior plywood is \"CDX.\" Plywood quality is ranked by letters of the alphabet, with \"A\" being the best ranking. Using this formula, CDX means that the plywood has one \"C\" side and one \"D\" side. The \"X\" means that it is designated for exterior use.\nExterior plywood is not restricted to outdoor use. It's almost always used as a subfloor in most homes so that its waterproof qualities will resist moisture from below or water that may be spilled from above. Exterior plywood can also be used on countertops around sinks or even inside cabinets. Exterior plywood works fine for just about any interior application, except for the fact that it has numerous defects or patches in the surface.\nThe majority of all exterior plywood is made from fir. This lumber is widely produced and harvested in the Northwest, making it the favorite for affordability and availability. Exterior plywood may be slightly more expensive, but typically it is not because it doesn't need to be finished. It is full of defects that do not detract from its usefulness but do restrict it to floors, exterior sheathing or other applications that cover the plywood.\nShaddy, Wade. \"What Is Exterior Plywood?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/exterior-plywood-99463.html.

But no matter their demographic category, the vast majority of people suffering with substance abuse don't get the help they need.\nTodd Crandell was a hockey player turned pharmaceutical sales rep in Ohio who spent years addicted to drugs and alcohol, going in and out of rehab without ever seeing results. \"I tried inpatient, outpatient, hypnotists, counselors and other modalities,\" he said. \"They didn't work. I wasn't ready to have anything work.\"\nUltimately, Crandell ended up quitting cold turkey thanks to vigorous running and racing in Ironman competitions. \"I took my negative addiction and turned it into a new focus,\" he said. He went on to become a drug counselor and to found the nonprofit Racing for Recovery, a fitness and health-focused program based in Holland, Ohio, whose goal is to help people suffering from addiction and those affected by them.\n\"I always ask people, 'What are you looking for?'\" Crandell said. \"The ideal program is one that meets that individual's needs and desires.\"\nUnfortunately, Crandell's dissatisfaction with the traditional treatment options is fairly typical. The vast majority of addicted people don't get any treatment or, if they do, go in and out of rehab repeatedly. A 2013 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for substance abuse at a specialized facility, yet only 2.5 million of those people got it.\nThere are many reasons for this huge gap in treatment, including wariness about the treatment experience itself and skepticism about whether it can really help. All people have their own story and need to follow a treatment path that meets their individual needs, which is why treatment programs offering a one-size-fits-all approach aren't particularly successful.\nSo what would the path with the greatest likelihood of full recovery for the patient look like? What would that treatment program entail?\nToday, most experts agree with Crandell that personalization is key. Programs should offer a wide range of services \u2014 from support groups and confidence-building activities to medical and mental health care \u2014 in order to customize a long-term plan that fits the unique needs of each individual.\nBefore treatment specialists can create a roadmap for an individual addicted person, they need an accurate picture of how that individual became addicted in the first place. A comprehensive initial evaluation not only helps the treatment providers understand the person's history with substance abuse, but also life history, including past trauma and mental illnesses such as depression that will need to be addressed in the course of treatment.\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 40 percent of people suffering from addiction have co-occurring mental health issues, and diagnosing these issues accurately allows the provider to address them \u2014 and to evaluate whether they might be the underlying cause of the addiction.\n\"These co-occurring conditions are becoming the norm rather than the exception,\" said Ashish Bhatt, chief medical officer at Sovereign Health, a residential rehabilitation treatment company based in San Clemente. \"We have to treat the root of why people are using drugs.

The mathematically-minded inventor first learned about military technology from dinner party conversations between her arms-manufacturer husband and Nazi German generals, before escaping to America where she eventually invented a new torpedo guidance system for the U.S. Navy.\nThe actress-inventor's life almost seems like a no-brainer for a Hollywood action hero makeover, given her brush with Nazis and behind-the-scenes efforts to aid the U.S. war effort during World War II. But her life is also fitting as a tragic drama \u2014 the glamour of the silver screen blinded most people to her inventor's passion that would lead to a patented \"frequency hopping\" breakthrough still used in civilian and military technologies today.\n\"The reason she set up inventor's room in her house and pursued inventing as a hobby was that she didn't drink, didn't smoke and didn't like parties,\" said Richard Rhodes, author of \"Hedy's Folly: The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr, the Most Beautiful Woman in the World\" (Doubleday, 2011).\nAny inventors willing to look beyond Lamarr's beauty would have found a kindred spirit, Rhodes said. She embodied the stereotype of the classic inventor who loved to tinker \u2014 her lesser-known inventions include an instant fizzy soda cube and a trash receptacle attached to tissue boxes.\nHer most recognized work came from co-inventing a frequency-hopping wireless signal for guiding U.S. Navy torpedoes to their targets. But even after Lamarr enlisted the help of fellow inventor George Antheil and received a \"Secret Communications System\" patent in 1942, the U.S. Navy ignored the breakthrough until its engineers rediscovered the patent in the mid-1950s.\n\"She was perfectly positioned as Mandl's wife \u2014 as an arm piece at the fancy dinners they gave \u2014 to hear discussions about what technology the Germans were developing, how they worked and what their problems were,\" Rhodes told InnovationNewsDaily.\nAfter Lamarr escaped her obsessive husband and headed for a new acting career in Hollywood, she grew furious over reports of German submarines torpedoing ships filled with refugees. She first suggested going to Washington, D.C., to testify about her knowledge of German technology before the National Inventor's Council, but nobody took her seriously.\nLuckily, Lamarr met and recruited Antheil to help develop her idea for frequency hopping (also known as spread spectrum) \u2014 a concept for having wireless radio signals switch quickly among many different frequency channels so that enemies could not jam the signal. Antheil's background as a musician and tinkerer came in handy when he came up with a workable concept similar to player-piano rolls that could synchronize the switching among 88 frequencies.\nThe Germans had their own wire-guided system for torpedoes, but Lamarr's wireless technology never saw action during World War II. Still, the U.S. Navy eventually applied the jamming-proof technology to radios used during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it went on to shape modern technologies such as GPS, Bluetooth in headsets and phones, and U.S. military guided missiles.\n\"Most of her ideas were interesting but trivial,\" Rhodes said. \"This one was fundamental.\"\nThis post was originally published by Innov"}

It\u2019s much harder to make that happen.\nBut here, change has to start from the bottom \u2013 everyone in tech needs to ask themselves, what I can do to be more ethical, and to make sure the digital revolution is focused on the positive changes it can bring to our lives."}

It's important to understand that the foreclosure process can take months or even years to complete and in California it takes at least 200 days.Your landlord will have plenty of time to fix the problem during the process and may save the property. Until then, stay as informed about the proceedings as possible, keep paying your rent as agreed upon and make sure your utilities stay on. In some states, you'll have to move once the foreclosure sale is complete. In others, the law protects you and may give you a chance to keep living in the property.\nDuring a foreclosure process, tenants rights are front and center . Check your lease term, communicate with your landlord, continue to pay your rent as scheduled and make sure your utility bills are current and in your name.\nForeclosure proceedings are a matter of public record, so you don't have to guess what's happening. If you receive a strange notice in the mail or find an inspector wandering around the property, get informed. In most cities, foreclosure paperwork gets filed with the local recorder of deeds, assessor or auditor. Go there and look for information about the property where you live. While you're there, ask how to receive notifications about the foreclosure proceedings. Many cities allow tenants to receive copies of foreclosure paperwork so they aren't blindsided if their landlord loses the property. In California, lenders must tell tenants when foreclosure is imminent. At least 20 days before the auction, the law requires the lender to post a notice on the rental property. This way you'll know what's happening, even if your landlord didn't tell you.\nThe foreclosure process doesn't end your lease, so it's important that you keep following it. This includes paying your rent as agreed. Failure to pay your rent can lead to eviction, however, and you'll lose any chance you have to stay put.\nWhen a property gets sold at foreclosure, existing tenants sometimes have the option of signing a lease with the new owner or staying until their old lease expires. California, for instance, requires the new property owner to honor your old lease unless it was a month-to-month arrangement or your new landlord plans to occupy your unit. In that case, you will be given a 90-day notice to leave.\nNote that while you do have to keep paying your rent as agreed, you don't have to give it to your landlord early. Desperate landlords sometimes try to talk tenants into paying their rent early, often claiming that they'll use the prepaid rent to save the property. You're under no obligation to pay your rent early, however, so don't feel pressured to do so. If someone comes and tells you that they're the new property owner, ask for documentation as proof before you start giving your rent to them.\nIf all of your utilities are in your name, you have nothing to worry about. Simply keep paying the bills as they come due. Some landlords, however, keep the utilities in their own name and either charge their tenants or cover the bills themselves. Foreclosure is a clear sign of financial problems, however, and so it's possible your landlord has stopped paying his utility bills as well as his mortgage. If he has, your service could get shut off. Watch your mail for any shutoff notices and call the utility company right away if you receive one or if you find your service suspended.

According to Fuente, he is not even entertaining any phone calls he says have been made.\nFuente is in his second season at Virginia Tech and has coached the Hokies to a record of 19-7 with an appearance in the ACC Championship Game last season. Fuente had previously coached Memphis to a 26-23 record over four seasons, turning the program around to be a consistent winner even after his departure. Fuente has won 38 games in the last four seasons, including a pair of bowl victories.\nVirginia Tech will play Oklahoma State in the Camping World Bowl on December 28.\nVirginia Tech hits the road this week to take on East Carolina, and they are doing so without starting right corner back Adonis Alexander. Hokies head coach Justin Fuente announced Alexander is not traveling with the team this weekend. Without spilling the details for why Alexander is not traveling with the team, Fuente strongly suggested Alexander was in violation of team rules.\nAlexander has started each of Virginia Tech\u2019s first two games of the season and has accumulated 14 tackles and three pass breakups. With Adonis not making the trip to East Carolina this weekend, Virginia Tech will likely slide his backup, Brandon Facyson into the starting role.

Shortly after arrival, crews found one patient located in a second floor science supply room who was exposed to sulfuric acid. The room was not occupied by students at the time of the emergency. The patient, who is a teacher at La Cumbre Junior High School, was treated on scene by firefighters and transported by AMR to Cottage Hospital where she was later flown by CalStar to a burn center.\nThe release of an unknown quantity of the hazardous material, along with other unknown chemicals in the near vicinity prompted the quick and timely evacuation of both the main building and cafeteria to isolate exposure to any other staff and students. Incident command worked closely with La Cumbre Junior High administration and Santa Barbara Unified School District officials on the response. Once safe locations were identified, school staff made the determination to keep students on campus and resume normal school sessions.\nSanta Barbara South Coast HazMat Response Team was activated which prompted the response of additional resources from Santa Barbara City Fire, Carpinteria-Summerland Fire and Montecito Fire Protection Districts. Each of these departments have specific pre-assigned roles within the team. Santa Barbara City Fire provided a total of 3 fire engines, a HazMat Unit, and a chief officer who was in command of the incident. Carpinteria-Summerland Fire provided an additional vehicle and decontamination trailer. Montecito Fire provided additional HazMat Specialist to support operations.\nA total of two entries were made by HazMat personnel where it was confirmed that approximately one quart of sulfuric acid had been spilled. Sulfuric acid is commonly found in chemical labs and industrial facilities and is the primary ingredient in batteries. It is one of the world\u2019s strongest acids which possess a significant hazard when it makes contact with skin. It is a colorless odorless syrupy liquid that is soluble in water. It is not gaseous and will not spread through the air or HVAC systems. This combination allowed crews to quickly contain the exposure.\nOnce the scene was neutralized and the emergent phase of the incident was mitigated, operations were transferred over to Channel Coast Corporation, a local HazMat cleanup crew based out of Santa Barbara. Channel Coast Corporation will work closely with school personnel to fully clean and decontaminate the area affected.\nEntry teams made access and neutralized the spill. The emergent phase of the incident has been mitigated. The hazardous material is confirmed to be approximately 1 quart of sulfuric acid. The spill is isolated to one classroom, however, due to an abundance of caution both La Cumbre staff and Incident Command have elected to maintain evacuation of the main building.\nParents may choose to pick up their students, however, it is not necessary as the students are safe and school remains in session. Normal pickup times remain in effect. \u201cCrews continue to make safe, slow and methodical progress towards stabilizing the situation\u201d, said Incident Commander Chief Chris Mailes. \u201cWe absolutely don\u2019t want to place the lives of any responders, the staff, or students at jeopardy\u201d.\nMembers of the South Coast HazMat team making entry to stabilize the scene.\nUnits from Santa Barbara City, Montecito and Carpinteria-Summerland Fire Departments are on scene of a Hazardous Materials emergency at La Cumbre Junior High School/Santa Barbara"}

{"idx": "35397", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Is Clean Energy's Niche Under Attack?\nClean Energy is focused on building natural gas demand in the industrial arena, the same space that a Tesla co-founder is going after.\nNatural gas specialist Clean Energy (NASDAQ:CLNE) made a strategic decision early on to enter the industrial market, focusing on such things as getting natural gas powered buses and garbage trucks on the road. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is working on expanding the reach of electric vehicles, took a different approach, hitting the consumer market first. Now, however, Tesla co-founder Ian Wright is looking to get into a Clean Energy niche.\nThe gasoline infrastructure in the United States is both mature and solidly entrenched. Then there's the massive fleet of gasoline-powered vehicles in the country and the sales and repair network built around it. It's a rough market to disrupt with new technology that lacks similar supporting infrastructure.\nThis is one of the reasons why Clean Energy decided to bypass the consumer market and focus instead on industrial customers. In this market, Clean Energy could show compelling economic and environmental reasons for making the switch to natural gas. Bus operators, airports, and garbage companies took the leap of faith.\nSince such vehicles generally have local, and in some cases highly predictable, routes integrating natural gas into the picture was relatively easy. Of course, switching to natural gas also comes with green benefits, too, since it burns more cleanly than gasoline.\nThe uptake was nothing short of incredible. For example, within the garbage truck sector, natural gas powered vehicles represented just 3% of new truck sales in 2008. In 2013 that number had grown to 60%. But this hasn't gone unnoticed.\nTesla co-founder Wright left the company shortly after its founding because he believed that electric cars were too costly for the average car buyer. Tesla CEO Elon Musk pretty much admitted that when he opened the company's patent portfolio to the world earlier this year: \"electric car programs at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\" He explained that gasoline powered cars were the competitive target\u2014not other electric cars.\nIan Wright highlighted the dilemma that led him to found Wrightspeed to Fast Company: \"The thing about electric drive technology is it's very efficient ... but it's not cheap. So you've got to think about who's going to pay the extra cost of these things.\" Essentially, you can save money by going electric, but only if you use a lot of gasoline. The typical car owner, he contends, does not. A garbage truck, on the other hand, can burn through $60,000 worth of fuel a year.\nWith electric vehicles starting to reach into Clean Energy's core markets, is the natural gas pioneer at risk? Maybe not. For starters, Clean Energy is expanding into new, bigger markets. That includes the long-haul truck sector, which is roughly five times the size of the garbage truck, airport vehicle, and bus markets combined. And it's looking at supplying mining trucks, trains, and ships. So there's still plenty of expansion potential at Clean Energy.\nThen there's the fact that Wright's product actually makes use of micro turbines to generate power when the batteries run low. According to the Wrightspeed, those turbines can be powered by diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), or even landfill gas.\nMoreover, the benefit of Wright"}

At the same time, finding a job that best plays to the strengths of the applicant can prove to be just as daunting for the job seeker.\nThere are a percentage of recruiting firms that charge their applicants, as well as sell interviewing and resume writing services to job seekers in conjunction with day to day recruiting operations.\n- In this economy, charging applicants a fee with no guarantee of a quick placement is highly unethical.\n- Companies that charge applicants are more apt to send those applicants in to their clients, thus creating undue favoritism and wasting everybody's time.\n- For employers, any firm that charges applicants is inevitably going to have a significantly small candidate pool to present their clients with. Many top job seekers refuse to associate with these types of organizations, and this unwillingness to pay recruiting fees ends up hurting the clients more so than other party.\n- Recruiting firms should in no way engage in for-profit ventures that could hinder the staffing process and relationship between the employer and candidate. There must be complete transparency between the 3 parties or the employer will feel as if he or she was used as a means for the recruiting firm to double its money on a career coaching deal.\nThe way a company recruits its own in-house talent is going to be indicative regarding the strength of their business acumen. As an applicant or job seeker, you should know exactly whom you are working with and which industry they came from.\nWhen it comes to qualifications, many recruiters like to put certifications after their name such as \"Career Coach.\" Unless a certificate of expertise was given by a well-known, accredited university, treat that qualification as more of a negative rather than a positive.\nI always question as to who is giving out these degrees and how many years (if any) it takes to obtain these certificates.

It is a grassroots movement with members in 188 countries worldwide.\nWhat is happening in Sheffield during the Global Divestment Mobilisation? During Global Divestment week, Sheffield Climate Alliance and South Yorkshire Fossil Free! are hosting events throughout the region.\nOn Saturday, South Yorkshire Fossil Free! will be out on the streets of Sheffield and Doncaster with a couple of giant dinosaurs and plenty of balloons, with our campaign \u2018Only dinosaurs invest in fossil fuels\u2019! This aims to persuade the South Yorkshire Pension Authority to divest their funds from fossil fuels. We will be talking to people to raise awareness about divestment and asking them to sign our petition to the SYPA.\nSo what is divestment? In a nutshell, divestment is when a company, institution, public body or individual removes their investments from a particular type of fund, in this case fossil fuel companies.\nDone on a large enough scale this will revoke the social licence of these companies to operate in a \u2018business as usual\u2019 mode. If enough people act to say that burning fossil fuels as we do now is unacceptable, the companies will have to change their method of working. Divestment was a key factor in the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa.\nThe argument for divestment is not just environmental; there is a strong financial argument too. Already, 80 per cent of the known coal, oil and gas reserves cannot be burned if we are to keep global warming to around two degrees Celsius.\nThese unburnable reserves will become \u2018stranded assets\u2019, that is they will not be able to be used and the value of these assets will plummet. This is a view shared by many financial experts, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. If the value of shares in the major fossil fuel companies falls, the value of our pension funds will also be affected.\nWith regard to reinvestment, pension authorities have a duty to make the best financial return for their members. However, this can be achieved without investing in fossil fuel companies. If the world is to make a successful transition to renewable energy, there is a need for rapid investment in green energy technologies. With its background in manufacturing and engineering Sheffield would be well placed to take advantage of a growth in this area. For example, manufacturing of tidal barrages and wind turbines could create jobs in the local steel industry. Another local angle is investment in community energy schemes like Sheffield Renewables, and money could be invested in retrofitting of council house stock.\nSheffield has made very positive steps with regard to divestment. Both universities have agreed to divest following pressure from People and Planet, a student-led climate movement. In addition to this, Sheffield City Council passed a motion in November in support of divestment.\nThe motion, passed at full council, stated that \u2018the council does not and will not invest in fossil fuels\u2019. Sheffield was the first city in the world to have both universities and the council pledging to divest.\nBut there is still more to do. SYPA has about \u00a36.1 billion"}

{"idx": "35403", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A common saying in financial markets asserts that leverage is the quintessential double-edged sword. That axiom may never be more relevant than it is in futures trading, specifically the crude oil markets. Led by the industry benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and North Sea Brent (Brent) contracts, crude oil futures are some of the most frequently traded derivatives in the world.\nDriven by a variety of fundamentals, as well as technicals, WTI and Brent are dynamic markets that provide participants many opportunities. Featuring consistent volatility, robust liquidity and wide daily ranges, WTI and Brent crude are commonly referred to as the Wild West of the futures markets.\nA word to the wise: If you are going to engage the WTI/Brent products, then be sure to have a fluent understanding of how oil futures leverage works.\nA great place to begin any discussion of oil futures leverage is by talking about contract size. In futures, a contract\u2019s size is the quantity of the underlying asset upon which valuations are based. It directly determines the value of each tick, effectively defining the degree of risk exposure being assumed by the buyer or seller.\nNo matter which product or market you\u2019re trading, a good first step in applying leverage is identifying the minimum tick value. For instance, the minimum tick value of the E-mini S&P 500 (ES) is $12.50 while the E-mini DOW (YM) is $5.00. Larger contracts, such as CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) or silver (SI), cost the trader $25.00 per tick. As shown above, both WTI and Brent crude futures are valued at $10.00 per tick.\nThis concept is elementary, yet many traders are blinded by the allure of extraordinary returns and ignore the negative implications of greater tick values. Without a firm grasp of how tick value can stress a trading account, catastrophic loss, margin calls, and premature position liquidations come into play.\nAssuming a $5000 account balance, taking a 1 lot position is doable. At $10.00 per tick, a given trade has 400 ticks of wiggle room before the position is liquidated or a margin call is placed. However, as the position size is increased, the margin for error shrinks exponentially. On only a 3 lot position, the cushion is reduced to an ultra-tight 66 ticks. At 4 lots, a negative 25 tick move in price will have your broker giving you or perhaps even automatically liquidating your position.\nIn practice, traders have many ways to put oil futures leverage into perspective. However, without a solid understanding of the concept of tick value, placing efficient trades becomes difficult at best.\nFinancial leverage is a complex topic, but its general properties are similar throughout the world of finance. In all markets, the basic rule for leverage is: Use it recklessly and perish; respect its power and prosper.\nFor more information on the global oil markets, as well as on how leverage plays a big role in the futures game, contact a broker at Daniels Trading.

That's an 80 percent decline.\nMonarch experts said that small coterie laid eggs on its return trip north this year, but the butterflies that hatched across the southern United States in early spring were hammered by drought in the south, then cold weather and lack of food the rest of the way north.\nWaconia naturalist Jim Gilbert said he has seen only one monarch so far this year, in his own garden.\nHe saw none while working in a prairie area near St. Peter on Tuesday. Last year he saw thousands during the northward spring migration, but their offspring were decimated by summer drought before they could travel back south, Gilbert said.\nOrdinarily, the distinctive butterflies, with gold-and-black wings trimmed with white specks, are common across the Minnesota landscape this time of year.\nAggressive suppression of milkweed in corn and soybean fields has removed a key piece of the monarch life cycle across much of North America, Oberhauser said.\n\"There's a strong correlation between the loss of milkweed habitat and loss of monarch numbers,\" she said.\nAlong with the drought in the second half of 2012, last year's unusually early spring and this year's unusually cold and wet one, monarchs are facing \"the tragedy of a problem with many causes,\" she said.\nVera Krischik, a University of Minnesota entomology professor, added that the absence of monarchs is part of a larger, more disturbing picture. Honeybees, bumblebees, parasitic wasps and many other kinds of beneficial, pollinating insects \u2014 including other butterflies \u2014 are also noticeably absent this year.\nKrischik, who is researching ways to blunt the declines under a grant from the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources, said linden trees, which are in bloom this time of year, should be buzzing with pollinating insects.\nShe said she was \"stunned\" when she checked 30 trees Wednesday and found only a single painted lady butterfly.\n\"It's not just that there aren't monarchs. There's nothing there,\" she said.\nKrischik said it's not just agriculture that has reduced the milkweed and other flowering weedy plants that pollinating insects need for nourishment.\nShe said it's also back-yard gardeners with a preference for flowering but sterile,"}

In a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday, he declared,\"Sanders is not a Democrat, has not been elected as a Democrat, has never served as a Democrat and cannot plausibly claim, at least in New Hampshire, to be a Democrat.\"\nWhile Sanders caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, the independent senator may have trouble qualifying for the Democratic ballot in New Hampshire.\n\"State law makes clear that candidates must be registered members of the party on whose ballot line they wish to appear,\" Bass explained. \"One might ask why the good senator can't simply change his registration in his home state from socialist or independent to Democrat. The answer is that Vermont doesn't have a party registration system, so he can't.\"\nBass went on to point out that Al Gore and George W. Bush also ran into this problem because Tennessee and Texas also do not register voters by party. But Gore and Bush were each able to show that they had appeared on ballots as a Democrat and Republican, respectively. Sanders, on the other hand, won the Democratic primary in Vermont, but he declined the nomination and asked that his name not appear on the general election ballot as a Democrat,\" Bass said.\nSo when Sanders shows up in New Hampshire at the secretary of state's office to file his papers for the Democratic primary, he shouldn't be surprised if his candidacy is challenged, Bass says. But he speculates that Sanders could get a boost from the Clinton campaign, which is far more likely to want to face him in New Hampshire in the Democratic primary, than in the general election if he's forced to run as an independent."}

{"idx": "35414", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Legislation introduced in the House this week would protect veterans from having to pay any interest that arises from mistakes made by federal agencies in calculating their military service deposits and pensions.\nThe Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans\u2019 Pensions Act (H.R. 4431) was introduced by Congressman Buddy Carter (R-GA). It authorizes federal agencies that make a mistake in calculating military service deposits and pensions to pay the incorrectly accrued interest on behalf of veteran employees.\nAccording to information provided by Carter, American veterans working at a federal agency are required to pay a military service deposit in order to receive their military service pension while working for the federal agency. Due to a misclassification in the type of the employee\u2019s status, the federal agency will therefore charge different interest rates on those military service deposits, often leading to miscalculations.\nOnce the federal agency becomes aware of the miscalculation, they will contact the veteran/employee and notify him or her of the need to pay back the balance with accrued interest. In some scenarios, that interest can be tens of thousands of dollars that the veteran would be required to pay.\nCurrently, Carter says, there is no recourse for veterans to mediate that payment and there is no authority for the federal agency to wipe away the incorrectly accrued interest. His bill would change that by authorizing agencies that make a mistake with these payments to pay the incorrectly accrued interest on behalf of the veterans.\nI introduced this legislation because I have heard from veterans faced with this unacceptable problem.\nAfter serving our nation, veterans are moving on to work for federal agencies and these agencies are miscalculating their pensions, accruing thousands of dollars in interest without the veteran ever even knowing about it.\nOur current system requires these veterans to repay sometimes tens of thousands of dollars in interest due to no fault of their own. My legislation says federal agencies, not our brave veterans, should pay the interest payments when the federal government is responsible for the miscalculation.

That's the equivalent of two full seasons. And we have absolutely no idea if he's good enough to be their quarterback of the future or if they need an upgrade to be legitimate contenders.\nOrton threw second-half interceptions right to Charles Woodson and Nick Collins. Though they were as bad as any pickoffs ever thrown by the vilified Rex Grossman, at least Orton showed on the Woodson play that he's a better tackler than Rex.\nAmazingly, the Bears survived Orton's horrendous performance, winning 20-17 in overtime to keep their playoff hopes alive.\nGM Jerry Angelo, who has struggled to find quality QBs during his two decades as an NFL personnel honcho, has to keep looking. Even if Orton turns out to be the answer, the Bears need depth at the position.\nAngelo certainly should take his time evaluating Orton. There's no reason the sides couldn't agree on a long-term deal during next season - just as the Packers did with Aaron Rodgers this year.\n2. Devin Hester has come a long way as an offensive player for the Bears. Why, he's made so much progress, he might even be good enough to be the No. 3 wide receiver for the Packers.\nIn the first half alone Monday, Rodgers completed 12 passes to five different wide receivers. Orton had two completions to his wideouts. Chicago's receivers couldn't get open and, when they did, they couldn't make catches. Hester dropped what might have been a touchdown pass, forcing the Bears to settle for a field goal. Hester added two other drops, and Marty Booker whiffed on a throw right to him.\nThe Bears' top four pass-catchers include a tailback (Matt Forte) and two tight ends (Greg Olsen, Desmond Clark).\nAside from Hester, the wideouts barely are in the team picture. They've gotten tired of being called out by fans and media, and coach Lovie Smith - an expert enabler - predictably takes the players' side.\n3. Lance Briggs deserved to go to the Pro Bowl, but none of his defensive teammates even was close.\nThese days, Brian Urlacher looks lost as often as he looks dominant.

Local businesses will be able to sign up to use this feature soon and people will be able to find Deals in the coming weeks,\" Facebook says in a statement.\nThe new social buying feature expands the Facebook Deals service launched in November. Deals offers you coupons from businesses in your immediate vicinity when you check-in using Facebook's location-sharing service, Places. Deals features general coupon deals such as 20 percent off jeans as well as loyalty-based offers such as \"buy nine lattes get your tenth free.\" It's not clear if Facebook's new coupon service will require a specified number of buyers before the deal goes into effect, as Groupon does.\nFacebook says it wants to focus on offering deals you're more likely to want to do with others. \"You won't get your legs waxed with friends,\" Emily White, Facebook's director of local operations, told The Financial Times. \"You dine out, you go to concerts, you do outdoor activities. We want to make sure those experiences are maximized.\" The new coupons will reportedly come directly from Facebook as well as from partner deal sites such as Gilt City, PopSugar City, Tippr, and Zoni.\nLocal coupon deals appear to be the hot new trend among tech companies. Google in December failed to buy Groupon for a reported $6 billion and later started planning its own local coupon service. Amazon recently invested $175 million in the coupon site LivingSocial. Location-sharing service Foursquare on Wednesday expanded its Specials feature, which allows businesses to offer seven different deal types to Foursquare users.

May it guide you toward well-played future beer and food choices at these awesome establishments.\nIt was sunny. I was sweaty and sunburned.\nBut the moment some cold Canteen hit my lips, all things became right with the world.\nThis bright ale by San Juan Capistrano-based Docent Brewing Co. exemplified the perfect drink for that Doheny weekend: unpretentious and smooth \u2014 a cold respite on the hot sand.\nCanteen (4.5% alcohol by volume, or ABV) gets its flavor profile from German pilsner malt, honey, almond, spicy Magnum Saaz hops and rice.

That\u2019s when Memphis Taco\u2019s pulled pork and nacho cheese comes to the rescue.\nThe meat tasted sweet and savory, the chips offered a remarkably perfect crunch.

And it was \u00ad\u2014 I loved it. But what I was surprised to discover is that on top of being a fabulous musical, the film is really a mother-daughter love story full of emotion, loss and connection through the generations \u2014 something very powerful for me right now.\nI lost my mother, Robin, two weeks ago. My mother and I had a difficult relationship; she an impulsive free spirit, me studious and cerebral, we never saw eye to eye about her lifestyle choices that often left me cleaning up her messes. In many ways, I often felt like I was the parent and she the child. On a positive note, from her I learned to be independent and circumspect and found ways to express myself through my writing \u2014 something she encouraged when I was young.\nRobin was bedridden for the last five years. Her disease was one I\u2019d never heard of: corticobasal degeneration, a progressive neurological disorder that\u2019s basically a strong cocktail of Parkinson\u2019s mixed with a splash of Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s one of life's bitterest torments, especially since there is no cure. Doctors don't know what causes it. I certainly wouldn\u2019t serve this drink to my worst enemy, let alone my own mother.\nI was incredibly excited for the distraction of seeing a press screening of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. I couldn\u2019t wait to escape into a dark theater, shove popcorn in my mouth, sip an iced tea bigger than my head and zone out to the enchanted ABBA tunes I remember fondly from my childhood.\nI knew that the incredibly talented Lily James would be playing a younger version of Donna, the role played by Meryl Streep in the first film, in flashbacks. At the same time, the film also follows Sophie\u2019s (Amanda Seyfried) life with her husband and three dads, making the movie both a prequel and a sequel.\nWarning: If you haven't seen the film yet, there are spoilers ahead.\nStreep is the same age as my mother. Both were born in June of 1949. Both were beautiful blondes. I had never connected them together in my mind before, but watching the movie was, in many ways, like watching my own mother up on-screen.\nJames plays the young Donna as a free-spirited, sexually adventurous flower child of the 1970s (just like my mother), looking to discover herself as she traipses through Europe, singing and dancing all the way. Not surprisingly, she becomes pregnant (one of the side effects of free love) and doesn\u2019t know which of the three men with whom she\u2019s rendezvoused is the father (the premise of the first film). The sequel maintains that mystery.\nIn the present-day storyline, Donna's daughter, Sophie, is throwing a grand reopening of her mother\u2019s villa, the Hotel Bella Donna, one year after Donna's death. The occasion is bittersweet considering many of the characters are still grieving for Donna, including Sam (Pierce Brosnan). He opens his heart to Sophie, telling her he feels bad for abandoning Donna when she was pregnant and leaving her alone all those years ago.\nWhat I think Sophie means is the love between them was big enough to fill both their hearts, even"}

Indeed, corruption could kill Nigeria, if we do not scale up our proficiency in contract and procurement management process,\" Mr Magu said.\nHe further observed that \"the establishment of the EFCC in 2003 was because of the determination of the Federal Government to combat fraudulent activities of some Nigerians and foreigners, mismanagement in the economic sector, corruption by public officials and lack of accountability and transparency in government dealings.\"\nHe identified some of the fraudulent practices in procurement processes in Nigeria to include: kickbacks, conflict of interests, fraud in the bidding process, bid suppression, collusive bidding, bid rotation and market division. Others according to him are: co-mingling of contracts, change order abuse, cost mischarging, defective pricing, false statement and claim, phantom vendors, product substitution, unnecessary purchases and purchases for personal use or resale.\nMr Magu expressed confidence that Nigeria still has patriotic and credible individuals who would do all within their abilities to uphold the credibility and honesty required for leadership in public offices."}

The police watched but did not move against the strikers. Workers at the Qilu plant are mostly locals with a proud tradition of building \u201csocialism\u201d since the 1949 revolution, and they earn between \u00a367 and \u00a3133 per month.\nWhat China\u2019s rulers fear most is the potential for unity between these two halves of China\u2019s rapidly expanding working class \u2013 migrants from the countryside and established urban workers.\nIt would be foolish to indulge in predictions, but there is evidence to suggest that a convergence of interests is inching up the agenda as the barriers to unity fade under China\u2019s appetite for continued growth and accumulation.\nA major remaining constraint on unity is the draconian restrictions on residency. The hukou (household registration) system ties rural people to their place of birth and only allows them to reside in the cities while they are in work and have their papers in order.\nOver the last decade, the government has been forced to relax these rules under pressure from capitalists needing a large reserve army of unemployed workers in order to keep wages down.\nAt the same time, both business and the state have found the household registration system to be an important instrument of control that allows them to force militant workers back to the countryside.\nThroughout the 1990s and early years of this century, the bosses and newly autonomous state-owned enterprise directors had it all their way. Up to 45 million urban employees were laid off and up to 150 million rural migrants left the fields in search of work in the towns and cities.\nAs China embraced capitalist globalisation, state policies created an irresistible environment for investors and multinational companies.\nThis was especially true in the southern and eastern coastal provinces that have spearheaded the country\u2019s transformation from an economy producing mainly for domestic markets to an economy producing for global markets.

Because if Wall Street has been demonized, it\u2019s safe to say the Pope\u2019s favorite number is 666. There\u2019s been a lot of talk in President Obama\u2018s administration, but very little action, when it comes to Wall Street and their antics, which were partly responsible for the home foreclosure crisis and completely responsible for the risky investments that led to billion dollar bailouts shortly thereafter. It\u2019s past time for President Obama to get aggressive.\nThat\u2019s not the mark of a man who is in touch with the reality so many Americans are currently facing.\n(1) Relaxing rules that were just passed by Congress to better regulate public companies will only lead to all stakeholders \u2014 businesses, consumers, and Congress itself \u2014 realizing there\u2019s no commitment to regulatory change.\n(2) Worker productivity, the measure of output of each worker, has been high for years as the economy struggled through a recession and businesses cut back on labor expenses. But it really couldn\u2019t get much higher, because there are only so many hours each employee can work \u2014 the manufacturing sector saw, \u201cthe largest quarterly gain in hours worked since the fourth quarter of 2005,\u201d according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Businesses are bound to start hiring once consumer demand returns to its regular levels. No amount of administration kowtowing or rule bending will change that. And increasing consumer demand starts with consumer confidence (which, by the way, has increased for five straight months, something the administration does deserve credit for), not allowing businesses to do as they please.\nIronically, at a time when there couldn\u2019t be both better timing and a better platform in which to deliver an economic message with populist zeal, the administration has wasted its opportunities: Occupy Wall Street has brought income inequality to the forefront of politics for months; the GOP frontrunner, Mitt Romney, pays one of the lowest tax rates of any major presidential candidate in the last 25 years; the man who trails him, Newt Gingrich, wants to enact a tax plan that would have Romney paying a 0% rate on the far majority of his income (which is capital gains and is currently taxed at a 15% rate).

But it doesn\u2019t always result in the best stories. Ang\u00e8le Christin explored the influence of these metrics in an American and a French newsroom.\nWe\u2019ve all been lured by captivating headlines from online news publications: You\u2019ll never believe it. What happens next will shock you. Eight things you should never do.\nAlso known as clickbait \u2013 items with overpromising titles often delivering underwhelming content \u2013 these stories proliferate on news blogs and websites.\nCurious to know more about how clickbait became prevalent in the modern newsroom, Ang\u00e8le Christin, an assistant professor of communication at Stanford, followed some reporters and editors who write them.\nDigital data and audience metrics have transformed journalism, said Christin in a study published March 20 in The American Journal of Sociology that examines how metrics shape newsroom dynamics in the United States and France.\nThanks to readily available real-time analytics, journalists and editors now know more about their readers than ever before. They can track how many people read each article, how long readers stay on a page and how they found the story. They know what gets read and what doesn\u2019t \u2013 constituting a major transformation from traditional print journalism.\nFor most American news websites, such metrics are an important factor for online advertising revenue. The more unique visitors a website attracts and the more page views an article gets, the more money it can make from advertisers. This dynamic drives stories that get higher traffic rather than higher quality stories.\n\u201cIt is impossible to look at the recent evolution of journalism without looking at the evolution of online advertising because the two things are completely interconnected,\u201d said Christin. Search engines such as Google and social media sites including Facebook have also expanded options traditionally available to advertisers, putting more pressure on news sites to bring in traffic and compete for those advertisers.\n\u201cAs online advertising became increasingly competitive, news organizations did what they had to do to survive in this new environment,\u201d Christin said.\nMarket pressure might explain to some extent why editors and journalists chase clicks with stories about cats and celebrities instead of serious news topics such as foreign policy or the economy, but according to Christin\u2019s research, it is more nuanced than that.\nChristin wanted to better understand how journalists and editors really worked under this new hyperawareness of data. How are journalists making sense of these audience metrics? How do they react to traffic numbers? Are market forces really compromising their journalistic integrity?\nChristin shadowed web journalists and editors for several years at two publications: one in the U.S. and the other in France, where news media are heavily subsidized by the state. Because the state is a major actor in the media, French newsrooms do not encounter the same commercial pressures as their American counterparts, explained Christin. If revenues are out of the equation, then seemingly the pressure for clicks would not be as high.\nBut Christin found the opposite. At the French publication she studied, French writers fixated on clicks to a much higher extent than their U.S. counterparts. They obsessed over clicks because they saw it as a symbol of their impact as a writer in shaping the public debate, Christin said.\n\u201cMy findings are paradoxical: You would expect French journalists to be much more anti-clicks compared to American journalists because U.S. journalism is much more market-driven,\u201d said Christin, noting that American journalists viewed metrics as more of a technical game separate from their professional identity.\nWhile American editors felt responsible for the commercial success of the publication, staffers"}

And everything has its place and its function. Which makes it a fine place to address the complexities of a world in which so many feel overwhelmed by information.\nWe volunteer for the struggle, of course. I downloaded the book having thumbed between apps, in and out of online magazines, glancing at small pieces and fragments.

Specialized contraptions of all shapes and sizes rest on our countertops waiting to be called upon for specific purposes. What can come as no surprise to anyone is that these countertops can become quite cluttered--and quite quickly, as we add to our arsenal of cookery. However, this maze of gadgetry doesn't have to be inescapable; one or two overachieving appliances with multitasking capabilities are all that is needed to create a sense of order into the kitchen.\nIf you find that you cannot live without an indoor grill, panini press, or electric griddle, Breville has the Smart Grill & Griddle, which combines these popular appliances into one convenient unit. Featuring removable plates and a design that opens a full 180 degrees, the countertop appliance can either be used as a press or as an electric grill or griddle. Additionally, the unit features the ability to lock into place, effectively turning it into a broiler. Most clamshell-style grills or griddles simply press down on the food, making it impossible, for example, to brown the top of an open-faced sandwich.\nJust because this combination grill/griddle/press can accommodate a variety of cooking tasks doesn't mean that more familiar functions get left behind. The machine features an adjustable center angle, meaning that fat and grease can be channeled away from foods, and collected into a drip tray. For additional efficiency, the heating elements are embedded directly into the plates, and automatically adjust when new food is introduced. As a final measure of convenience, the removable plates are dishwasher safe, allowing for easy cleanup, no matter what you decide to cook."}

This week we're competitors.\"\nIn his first season as an NFL head coach with Tennessee, Vrabel gets his first crack at both his old coach and former team Sunday when the Titans (4-4) host the Patriots (7-2).\nThe men share some of the same philosophies about football, though not personalities.\nTitans cornerback Logan Ryan, who spent his first four seasons in New England, says Vrabel's also younger and taller than Belichick. Vrabel may dress a bit better too during games, and Ryan sees some other similarities.\n\"They're hard-nosed. They care about the fundamentals,\" Ryan said.\nFor his part, Belichick says Vrabel will be a great coach with his passion and football knowledge as a player easily carrying over. Belichick also believes Vrabel deserves to be recognized in the Patriots Hall of Fame and yes, the Nashville native cheers for Vrabel and the Titans every game except this one.\n\"It will be the Patriots against the Titans,\" Belichick said. \"That's what it will be.\"\nThe Patriots have won six straight after beating Green Bay 31-17 last week. They also have won the past seven against the Titans, including playoffs, with the most recent a 35-14 romp in the divisional round last January. The Titans snapped a three-game skid Monday night with a 28-14 win in Dallas.\nOnly a trio remains of those who played alongside Vrabel during his tenure in New England: Brady, kicker Stephen Gostkowski and special teams captain Matt Slater. Brady spent eight seasons with Vrabel from 2001 to 2008. Gostkowski arrived in 2006, and Slater was a rookie during Vrabel's final season in 2008 before being traded.\n\"His body can do it longer than mine could at the position that he plays,\" Vrabel said of Brady.\nPatriots cornerback Jason McCourty spent his first eight seasons with the Titans and now plays alongside twin brother, Devin, in New England. Trying to rebuild, Tennessee has stocked up on former Patriots including general manager Jon Robinson, Vrabel, Ryan, right guard Josh Kline. Robinson signed cornerback Malcolm Butler and running back Dion Lewis this offseason. Also, Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees was an assistant and coordinator with the Patriots.

NFL Media historian Elliot Harrison will judge cases for induction in a recurring feature on NFL.com. With a list of such notable players, there are sure to be disagreements, so hit up Elliot on Twitter @Harrison_NFL to share your opinion.\nToday, we look at six guys who played offensive skill positions, listing them from most likely to be inducted to least likely.\nOf the skill-position players, Harrison has the best shot at being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014. With Harrison, it's all about the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He boasts more than 1,100 receptions and logged eight straight seasons of 1,100 receiving yards or more. (Only Jerry Rice surpassed that latter mark.) Then throw in the fact that he won a Super Bowl ring, and scored well over 100 touchdowns -- everything is there. Perhaps what's most important: He's not just a numbers guy, even if he did set an NFL record with 143 catches in 2002; at one time, he was in the discussion as the best receiver in the game.\nWhile Davis might be a controversial pick due to his smaller catalog of work, I think he gets in before Jerome Bettis. I've changed my position on this since going out to Canton in August. While some voters take into account that Davis played just seven NFL seasons, there is NO question he was the premier running back in the game when he was healthy. His three-year run from 1996 to 1998 might be the best three-year stint any running back has ever had -- 5,296 yards, a Super Bowl MVP award, a league MVP Award and, of course, two Lombardi Trophies. Pretty tough to top. And I made sure to tell him Wednesday on NFL Network's \"NFL AM\" that he belongs.\nThere are voters who consider Reed a Hall of Famer, and clearly plenty who don't. That's why this guy has been a finalist in the voting process seven times. Why hasn't he gotten over the top? Well, right now there is a backlog of great players, with a very strong class of retirees coming in: Derrick Brooks, Tony Dungy, Marvin Harrison and Walter Jones are eligible. Michael Strahan and Charles Haley are out there. Reed ranks over Brown and Bettis mostly because he has quite the public backing from Bills fans and former players who have said -- time and again, on TV and radio -- that he belongs in Canton. The fact that he played in cold-weather games (less than 40 degrees) also plays a role; though, there were just 18 of them. The fact that he never posted back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, however, must weigh on voters' minds.\nThere is plenty of respect around the NFL for Brown, but perhaps more than any other wide receiver, his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been made difficult by the logjam at the position.

Partly because they\u2019re seasoned collaborative instrumentalists, and partly because, after almost a decade of playing together, they\u2019re so open with one another\u2014and, therefore, their listeners.\nOn Tides of A Teardrop, the North Carolina duo\u2019s fifth studio album, Marlin and Frantz leave it all out to dry\u2014loss, pain, heartbreak and the process of emerging from it all in one piece\u2014in a way that feels more comforting than confessional. Tides of A Teardrop is a cozy cradle of acoustics and anecdotes on grief and love.\nMarlin and Frantz, who share instrumental and songwriting duties, know how to draw maximum emotion from a song. On the very first track and second single, \u201cGolden Embers,\u201d they\u2019re already seeking pathos and exploring nostalgia, greeting us \u201cjust like an old friend, kinder than expected.\u201d It\u2019s a track about making room for memories, even as grief abides (in Marlin\u2019s case, the death of his mother). Later on the song, they proclaim, in a wizened sigh, \u201cLoss has no end / it binds to our connection.\u201d \u201cGolden Embers\u201d is a beautiful way of looking at life\u2019s dark moments\u2014maybe those pitfalls brings us closer together.\nFrantz sings following a gentle slide guitar solo.\n\u201cLike You Used To\u201d is slightly twangy, but Mandolin Orange sound more country than ever on the blunt \u201cLonely All The Time,\u201d even as the instrument for which they\u2019re named reminds us they\u2019re forever tied to bluegrass. As the band\u2019s name would imply, the mandolin really is the connector holding the whole record together. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of being lonely all the time,\u201d Frantz and Marlin sing in unison on \u201cLonely,\u201d as the mandolin chirps on in the background. The isolation woes sound a little less sad when those two voices sing them together.\nThis is a quiet album. But is there anything wrong with being quiet? Absolutely not, especially when an artist, like Mandolin Orange, makes an emboldened kind of peaceful music, tunes that loosely float along while simultaneously delivering deeply emotive stories. The songs on Tides of A Teardrop are slow-tempoed and even-tempered, but in a way that feels emotionally powerful.\nThat calm nearly becomes monotony as the record edges to a close. \u201cLate September\u201d sort of drags on as Marlin sings the small-town blues, \u201ccounting down to closing time.\u201d \u201cTime We Made Time,\u201d however, feels like the perfect way to end a record. Marlin and Frantz sail out on a note of serenity. \u201cIt\u2019s time we made time just for talking,\u201d they sing. \u201cIt\u2019s time we made time to heal.\u201d Just like the character in the song, Mandolin Orange \u201csoftly, tenderly\u201d use \u201cdelicate voices\u201d to build up a kind of emotional first aid kit, helping you to patch up whatever needs some patching up.

Appleberry, and took his last breath on January 18, 2017. He was a man who loved his wife, his children, his vegetable garden, his dental profession, and helping others. Eric grew up in the village of Yellow Springs, Ohio, a place and community that remained close to his heart throughout his life. At age 12, just before starting 7th grade, he began working at the Yellow Springs News doing odd jobs as a \"printer's devil,\" and within a year was running the huge 1895 Babcock press. He credited these early years for his later ability to easily \"read\" his dental patients' mouths upside down and backwards. According to a 1958 newspaper profile, he was known at the print shop for his technical expertise, calm under pressure, impish humor, and feisty spirit. These traits never left him. After graduating from Bryan High School in 1959, Eric attended Ohio State University, where he pursued his future wife Patricia Paxton and his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree with equal dedication and resourcefulness. He and Pat married in 1964 and were soon joined by daughters Jennifer and Nicole. In 1968 Eric entered the United States Air Force; the family was stationed in California then Japan, where daughter Gretchen was born. In 1972 they moved to Ann Arbor, where Eric earned his specialty degree in periodontics at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. He then taught at the University and eventually transitioned into full-time private practice. At home, Eric made time for nightly family dinners, frequently illustrating scientific concepts for his daughters on a seemingly endless series of napkins. He enjoyed playing folk guitar and caring for tropical fish in his 75-gallon saltwater tank. Influenced by his parents' homesteading, Eric and family moved to the countryside east of Ann Arbor where he spent many a happy hour planning and working in their giant garden. He loved taking long runs down dirt roads, soaking in the sights and sounds of the rural landscape. Eric always chose to move forward through challenges with a positive outlook. Even after a spinal cord injury in 1998 left him paralyzed from the chest down, he concentrated on what he could do, not what he couldn't. He recruited friends to help adapt his John Deere tractor with hand controls and a boat-winch-powered seat lift. An avid photographer, he continued to document family gatherings and the beauty of nature. He kept up with a wide circle of friends through the magic of the internet. Eric's wholehearted commitment to serving others took many forms over the years. He was devoted to his patients and meticulous in their care. After his injury made private practice impossible, he found other ways to contribute to his profession and community. He reviewed articles for the Journal of Periodontology and served on the UM Medical School's Institutional Review Board. He volunteered as a member of the Dean's Faculty at the UM School of Dentistry, providing students with a long-term practitioner's perspective. Although he had received a number of awards throughout his career, he felt particularly honored when the periodontal program's graduating class of 2011 selected him for their Faculty Appreciation Award.

It\u2019s no secret that atheism and agnosticism is on the rise in the U.S., and that may be for many reasons, but I think many of them dismiss religion for its dogma and that is unfortunate because there is so much wisdom in those writings that has nothing to do with the divine element.

A strong argument could be made that it has some of the most influential social and cultural stories of mankind. In the U.S. we have built a great society around the ideas of the sovereignty of the individual and not the state.

To address the most significant digital risk\u2014created by business model disruption by competitors\u2014it is critical to examine whether the core strategy itself remains sufficient in the face of new technologies and as nontraditional competitors enter the marketplace, according to William (Bill) Ribaudo, managing partner of Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory\u2019s Digital Risk Venture Portfolio, Deloitte & Touche LLP. A member of Deloitte\u2019s US CFO Program leadership team, Mr. Ribaudo discusses why organizations should reassess their business models to understand their digital maturity, and what steps can be deployed to address the strategic risks that come with today\u2019s increasingly ubiquitous digital technologies.\nQ: How do you define digital risk?\nBill Ribaudo: An organization\u2019s digital risk will vary depending on how it incorporates technology into the core of its business model. In the last decade, many organizations have applied digital applications and features to their businesses with various degrees of success. For example, some more traditional organizations applied digital technologies using a bolt-on approach through acquisition, without integrating them into the core business model. But rather than merely add new technologies, they should have considered making a more connected and fundamental shift in the business model itself. By taking a piecemeal approach, these organizations may have increased the associated digital risks. That\u2019s not to say companies need to be fully digital to survive. Rather, they need to find the right mix of physical and digital assets, a strategy that is still elusive to many.\nBased on our research, shareholders place a higher value, measured as a multiple of revenue, on more digitally enabled companies. CEOs, particularly those of more traditional companies, are growing aware of the need to invest in digital operations and infrastructure. And the way they make that transformation is critical to their future competitive success, and managing the risks they will face.\nSo when we talk about digital risk, it\u2019s important to first look at how organizations are applying digital. Generally, they fall into one of two broad categories: they either use digital in the business or they use digital as the business, and the difference is significant for their risk profiles. Digital in the business refers to those organizations that are adapting digital applications to their existing physical businesses. A large retailer using digital technology for their point of sale (POS) system is an example. If the POS system goes down, customers can continue to make some purchases, such as with cash and check, and the retailer can still conduct business.\nIn contrast, digital as the business refers to companies in which digital is the way they transact, such as an online e-hailing ride service. In this case, if there\u2019s disruption in internet connectivity, it cannot conduct business; and typically as a result, business with customers stops. So the digital risks in this business model are dramatically different than a business that uses technology in the business, and the risks likely will have a more significant impact on the business.\nQ: How does digital risk differ from more traditional types of risk that organizations face?\nBill Ribaudo: What is different is the speed of impact. If you analyze how those risks play out within a business, they work through three traditional risk management channels\u2014strategic risk, operational risk, and governance risk.\nStrategic digital risk is the fundamental threat now faced by many companies that have not successfully incorporated a digital framework into their business model. Companies may do a solid job executing operationally focused strategies, but if they don\u2019t progress toward business models that balance physical and digital capabilities, they increase the risk of being disinter"}

For judging by an online recording of the concerto, the piece unfolds as an optimistic, celebratory work that\u2019s far less gnarly and aggressive than listeners might expect of a 21st century opus.\nTo Gunn, \u201cIt\u2019s just a sweet, happy, wonderful piece that uses the piccolo beautifully from top to bottom, and mostly in the middle register, where the piccolo can really sing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very light orchestra, very small strings \u2026 very delicate in orchestration, so everybody can be heard.\nWhen Benshoof was writing the piece, he conceived a pastoral scene.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re outdoors \u2013 the piccolo is outdoors, looking around, walking around a little but, eventually bumps into an oboe, who says something,\u201d explains Benshoof. \u201cThen she goes on, bumps into an English horn.

In the world premiere teaser trailer that screened during the panel, Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock sets the scene via dramatic voiceover: \"Something's coming.

Visitors spent $2.7 million, about $500,000 more than 2010 \u2014 the last time the Jets were in Cortland for camp after staying home in 2011 following the NFL\u2019s labor lockout.\nHotel occupancy increased from 67.9 percent to 70.1, and revenues were up about $300,000 last August from August 2010.\nManish Patel, general manager of the Days Inn in McGraw, located 2 miles from the campus, said occupancy at his hotel was still solid in the first week of camp but acknowledged a slight drop from a year ago.\nThe first day of practice open to the public last summer drew a whopping 2,588 fans. This year? Around 800.\nThat\u2019s still a respectable number that\u2019s in line with Jets camps from previous summers, but far from the massive crowds shown on ESPN a year ago, when the network camped out for nearly a week and had live broadcasts from practice.\nAlso according to the study, 63 percent of the more than 35,600 fans who attended the 11 open practices had never before attended training camp.\nThe obvious reason most point to? Tebow was in town.\nIn 2010, the Jets drew 41,000 fans but there were 14 days open to the public, with several of them consisting of morning and afternoon practice sessions. The NFL\u2019s new collective bargaining agreement in 2011 did away with the two-a-days, so that has also had some effect on attendance.\nThe city absolutely embraces the Jets, with green and white welcome signs at just about every corner.

And so it is with Ireland.\nFrom the moment Theresa May decided to leave the single market and customs union, it was clear this was going to be a problem. The island of Ireland contains the UK's only land border with the EU, so outside of French checkpoints it was going to be a focal point for problems. But unlike French checkpoints, these border positions are heavy with political consequence. Any visible border infrastructure could be interpreted as a de-facto worsening of partition.\nThese problems were raised with ministers in those early heady days of the Theresa May administration, but she and her government seemed completely ignorant of the economic hit the Republic of Ireland was facing.\nIreland has two problems. The first is being disconnected from the British market, which buys \u00a313bn in goods from it each year, including 42% of its exported food and drink. The second is that the UK stands between Ireland and the European market, which is worth \u00a340bn.\nEighty per cent of the Irish road freight going into Europe goes through the UK. There is simply no other effective route. Ferrying straight into France takes twice as long, which is particularly problematic when many of the exports are food products. So the Irish are caught in Britain's gravitational field.\nEven without tariffs, the bureaucracy of border checks is a massive issue. Road delivery would face four customs checks - two at departure and arrival into the UK and two again on the other side. Food products are also likely to require veterinary controls in addition to the customs orders. At the moment Dublin doesn't have the infrastructure for any of this. The port was set up with the expectation of free movement of goods and people.\nMinisters largely ignored this issue in the days before Article 50. David Davis, incredibly, seemed not to know that Ireland was a different state. He repeatedly referred to an \"internal\" UK border in a Sky interview shortly after taking the Brexit secretary role.\nBritain's decision to leave the single market and customs union means goods have to be checked at the border to see that they satisfy the domestic regulations of either side. They must also be checked to see that they are paying the correct tariffs and assessed for their country-of-origin to make sure a third country is not shifting them into the customs union under the cover of a trade arrangement with someone else.\nThere is really only one easy way to stop this, which is to stay in the single market and customs union. Britain has decided not to do this.\nSo instead the Brexiters have invented another solution, which is to unilaterally pledge not to enforce the border. This supposedly does whatever is in the UK's power to avoid the problem and shifts the moral responsibility onto the EU and the Republic.\nEven in the context of Brexit, where lots of very silly ideas are treated as if they are credible, it is unspeakably foolish.\nLet's say that in the near future Britain decides to become a low-tax, low-regulation economy, as people like Liam Fox and others have threatened. We might radically lower the standards for recycling in food packaging, for instance, or allow hormone-injected beef from the US into our market. The Brexiters are now effectively demanding that the EU promises not to conduct any checks on this huge gaping border into its territory. It can do nothing to stop those products, which are illegal in the EU, from entering its market. And once in Ireland, they can go anywhere in Europe without being"}

Intermediate-term yields or intermediate-term bond funds are yielding significantly more than short-duration portfolios today.\n\"And so if one is going to go short, there's a give up by some portfolios 200 to 300 basis points. And so the key question is, do interest rates evolve over the next two or three years fundamentally differently than what the bond market expects? I think one would have to have the view that interest rates, and the Federal Reserve in particular, is going to raise rates much more aggressively than the bond market expects for short-duration portfolio strategy to significantly pay off relative to a broader bond market exposure.\"\nThe SEC has charged Professional Investment Management Inc (PIM) and Douglas E.

The contract has plummeted over 7 per cent from around \u20b9190 on November 20 and is currently trading at \u20b9176 per kg. Though there is a support near current levels around \u20b9175, the contract looks vulnerable and a break below this level will increase the likelihood of a fall to \u20b9171 in the coming days. A further break below \u20b9171 will then drag the contract lower to \u20b9167.\nOn the other hand, if the contract manages to sustain above \u20b9175, a bounce to \u20b9180 and \u20b9181 is possible in the near term. The level of \u20b9181 is a crucial resistance. Only a strong break above this hurdle will ease the downside pressure and turn the outlook positive. In such a scenario, a relief rally to \u20b9185 and \u20b9187 is possible. But, inability to breach \u20b9181 will continue to keep the contract under pressure. It will also increase the possibility of the contract declining below \u20b9175.\nOn the global front, the Zinc (three-month forward) contract on the LME is hovering above a crucial support level of $2,430 per tonne. It is currently trading at around $2,487 per tonne. If the contract manages to sustain above $2,430 and move higher, an upmove to $2,550 is possible. A further break above $2,550 can then target $2,630.\nOn the other hand, if the LME-Zinc contract breaks decisively below $2,430, it can fall initially to $2,390. A further break below $2,390 will then increase the likelihood of the contract tumbling towards $2,300 or even $2,260 thereafter.\nShort-term traders with high risk appetite can wait for a bounce and go short if the contract reverses lower from the \u20b9180-181 resistance zone. Stop-loss can be placed at \u20b9186 for the target of \u20b9171. Revise the stop-loss lower to \u20b9178 as soon as the contract moves down to \u20b9175."}

Afghanistan accuses its neighbor of harboring the Taliban and other extremists who enter Afghanistan and then cross back into Pakistan where they cannot be attacked by Afghan or U.S.-led international forces.\nThe second sticking point is about the role and conduct of the counterterrorism force the U.S. wants to leave behind.\n\"The United States and its allies, NATO, continue to demand even after signing the BSA (bilateral security agreement) they will have the freedom to attack our people, our villages,\" Karzai said. \"The Afghan people will never allow it.\"\nKarzai's outburst came in response to a question about a NATO airstrike on Oct. 5 in Nangarhar province, near an airport used by U.S.-led international military coalition forces. The coalition, which has opened an investigation into the incident, said its forces struck insurgents trying to attack the base and that no civilians were harmed. The Karzai government claims five civilians were killed.\n\"They commit their violations against our sovereignty and conduct raids against our people, air raids and other attacks in the name of the fight on terrorism and in the name of the resolutions of the United Nations. This is against our wishes,\" Karzai said, using some of his harshest language to date against the U.S.-led military coalition.\nBoth parties were seeking to finalize a deal by the end of October - a time frame that would give military planners enough time to prepare to keep troops in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawal.\nKarzai said he will convene a council of elders in one month to help him make a decision on the pending agreement. If they endorse the agreement, then Karzai has political cover to agree to it.\nThe Afghan president is keenly aware that previous leaders of his country historically have been punished for selling out to foreign interests and wants to make sure that any U.S.-Afghan agreement is not seen in that context. Karzai, who cannot run for a third term, is slated to step down at the end of next year - the same time nearly all international troops are to have left the country.\nTalks were formally suspended in June and didn't resume until last month.

{"idx": "35487", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Irvine, Calif., \u2013 UC Irvine biologists have discovered that fats within cells store a class of proteins with potent antibacterial activity, revealing a previously unknown type of immune system response that targets and kills bacterial infections.\nSteven Gross, UCI professor of developmental & cell biology, and colleagues identified this novel intercellular role of histone proteins in fruit flies, and it could herald a new approach to fighting bacterial growth within cells. The study appears today in eLife, a new peer-reviewed, open-access journal supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust.\nHistones exist in large numbers in most animal cells; their primary job is to help DNA strands fold into compact and robust structures inside the nucleus. Gross said there is some evidence that histones secreted from cells protect against bacteria living outside cells. However, many bacteria enter cells, where they can avoid the immune system and continue replicating.\nIn principle, Gross said, histones could protect cells against such bacteria from the inside, but for many years this was thought unlikely because most histones are bound to DNA strands in the cell nucleus, whereas bacteria multiply in the cellular fluid outside the nucleus, called cytosol. Additionally, free histones can be extremely damaging to cells, so most species have developed mechanisms to detect and degrade free histones in the cytosol.\nIn their study, Gross and colleagues demonstrate that histones bound to lipid (fat) droplets can protect cells against bacteria without causing any of the harm normally associated with the presence of free histones. In experiments with lipid droplets purified from Drosophila fruit fly embryos, they show that lipid-bound histones can be released to kill bacteria.\nThe researchers injected similar numbers of bacteria into Drosophila embryos that contained lipid-bound histones and into embryos genetically modified to not contain them. They discovered that the histone-deficient flies were 14 times more likely to die of bacterial infections. Similar results were found in experiments on adult flies. Additional evidence suggested that histones might also protect mice against bacteria.\n\u201cBecause numerous studies have now identified histones on lipid droplets in many different cells \u2014 from humans as well as mice and flies \u2014 it seems likely that this system may be quite general,\u201d Gross said.\nPreetha Anand, Silvia Cermelli, Robilyn Sigua and Lan Huang of UCI; Zhihuan Li and Michael Welte of New York\u2019s University of Rochester; Adam Kassan, Marta Bosch and Albert Pol of the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain; and Andre Ouellette of USC contributed to the study (Anand et al. eLife 2012;1:e00003.

Since the moment she left\u2014or was ejected from\u2014the president\u2019s inner circle, Manigault has turned on Trump, dropping dire hints about what she saw and heard there, and slipping into the Big Brother house to proclaim that Trump\u2019s presidency is \u201cgoing to not be O.K.\u201d She stoked the intrigue with a publishing deal, and now it seems she\u2019s poised to capitalize on one of the juiciest aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency: his questionable mental state.\nThe question of Trump\u2019s fitness is not an idle concern, nor one that is consigned to the fringe. Earlier this year, a Yale University psychiatry professor\u2014one of over 100 medical professionals who signed a letter expressing their alarm over Trump\u2019s mental state\u2014held a closed-door briefing with several Democrat senators and at least one Republican to give her assessment of Trump\u2019s acuity. Her conclusion was not encouraging. \u201cWe feel that the rush of tweeting is an indication of his falling apart under stress,\u201d she told lawmakers, according to Politico. \u201cTrump is going to get worse and will become uncontainable with the pressures of the presidency.\u201d (The White House has repeatedly shrugged off these claims.) Manigault\u2019s insistence on delving back into the minefield may be designed to leverage our collective horror at the idea of a man in decline given access to the nuclear codes. But it\u2019s easy to see why she\u2019s succeeded."}

It is both informative and entertaining. Actually, my passion is collecting old trains, (they call me \u201cRailroad\u201d Ray) but cars come in a close second and model airplanes are next.\nI am part of the 1950s generation and proud of it as I graduated high school in 1953. Boy, do I miss those days. We moved around quite a bit due to my dad\u2019s job, starting out in Astoria, New York; then to Cleveland, Ohio, (Go Indians); then on to St. Louis, Missouri; over to Chicago, Illinois; and finally northern New Jersey. My first car was a 1947 Mercury Club Coupe with the flathead V8 and then my next was a neat 1951 Mercury Cub Coupe.\nSomewhere along the line, Uncle Sam intervened and sent me for a two-year vacation to Germany, where my tastes in cars slowly changed to sports cars and sports car racing in the European tradition. I came home to New Jersey with a 1961 Austin Healey Sprite (Bugeye) while my Army buddies opted for the Austin Healey 3000, an MGA and a Triumph TR-2.\nYou mentioned the Englishtown Raceway Park dragway in past columns and it brings back many good memories. I worked at that track when it first opened and they were the days. Back then they used flagmen for the start and there wasn\u2019t much electronics for record keeping. Over the years, I worked at Englishtown every weekend and when I could run the quarter-mile I did so in my 1958 Thunderbird, followed by a 1965 Mustang 289 V8 and then my 1969 Torino GT 351.\nOne other thing. In the 1950s, I twice entered the GM Fisher Body Craftsman\u2019s Guild to design and build a \u201cCar of the Future\u201d design competition. I didn\u2019t win, but I still have one of those cars in my toy collection. It reminds me of those great days of yesteryear every time I look at it.\nThank you Greg and I anticipate reading all of your future columns.\nA: Ray, thanks so much for your hand written letter, very interesting information and extremely kind words. You have brought back so many great memories and my apologies for the tardiness in responding. My letter file is overflowing, but I guess in this business that\u2019s a good thing.\nFor starters, let\u2019s get to when you returned from the Army with your Austin Healey Bugeye Sprite. I dug up some great photos of SCCA club racing action from 1961 at my then hometown Vineland Speedway road course in south Jersey. There, they ran SCCA sanctioned races regularly, and some big SCCA Divisionals every month. The many MGAs and Austin Healey 3000s bring back memories, as do the countless Bugeye Sprites I remember every time I went to the races.\nLike you, I took a liking to road racing although my heart was in the oval races on the half-mile asphalt track and the quarter-mile dragstrip that comprised the Vineland Speedway complex.\nYou mention you love to collect trains, cars and airplane models, another thing we have in common.

There was no conspiracy theory too bizarre, no rhetoric too hateful, no tax pledge too restrictive, no Alaskan governor too loony, no reality show host too coarse, mendacious or incompetent, that they could not make common cause in pursuit of power.\nWhich offers an interesting context to news that House Speaker Paul Ryan was pointedly snubbed last week by a group of eighth-graders. Students from South Orange Middle School in New Jersey were on a field trip to Washington, D.C., when they were offered a chance to take a picture with Ryan, often posited as the most thoughtful of thoughtful conservatives.\nSome observers have huffed that, had this happened to Barack Obama, it would have been called \u201cracist.\u201d Which is laughable, given that Obama spent eight years being snubbed in ways great and small, usually for reasons far less substantive than the one Malespina gave.\nOne thinks, unavoidably, of the Hans Christian Andersen fable, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes.\u201d Like the child in that story, these children are calling out what many adults should see, but don\u2019t.\nNamely that, where there is no moral foundation, the amassing of power can have no calling higher than the feeding of ego and the gratification of self. And that when you are willing to see America embrace its enemies and cold-shoulder its friends, willing to look the other way as justice is obstructed, willing to shut down programs funding the arts, rural aid, education, housing and food for the poor and infirm, willing to let rivers be contaminated, air befouled and sea levels rise, willing to take health care from 23 million people in order to line the pockets of millionaires and billionaires, to victimize the vulnerable in order to reward with more those who already have the most \u2026 you forfeit all claim of a moral foundation.\nSo let us hear no more about thoughtful conservatives saving us from the excesses of their peers. They\u2019ve had their chances to take the principled stance and flinched, every time.\nNow Paul Ryan\u2019s moral flexibility has become so odious that even middle-schoolers would rather stand upwind.

The Mustangs went 35-8 that season, losing a five-set match to San Antonio O\u2019Connor in the fourth round of the playoffs. Serving was one of Memorial\u2019s many strengths, as Marburger smashed a team-leading 58 aces with her hard float serve.\nThe former teammates only had fleeting moments to catch up on Saturday, Banks said. At the end of five grueling sets, UTRGV had knocked off then No. 15-ranked Baylor 25-14, 26-24, 16-25, 20-25, 15-10, marking the highest-ranked opponent UTRGV is believed to have ever beaten.\nThe match stands as an early season highlight for Banks, who is making a Valley homecoming this year after spending her first two collegiate seasons at Niagara.\nBanks finished the match with two kills and two block assists \u2014 modest totals relative to the numbers she\u2019s posted this year.\nSo far this season, the 6-foot-1 middle blocker has started eight of 10 matches for UTRGV, averaging 1.15 kills and 0.62 blocks per set.\nAs a freshman at Niagara in 2016, Banks averaged 0.72 kills and 0.55 blocks per set, appearing in 64 of the team\u2019s 120 sets. She took a significant step forward as a sophomore, appearing in all but one set and averaging 1.71 kills on a team-best .301 hitting with a team-high 0.99 blocks per set.\nNiagara as a team also showed progress, improving from 12-19 overall and 10-8 in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in 2016 to 18-10 overall and 14-4 in conference in 2017. Then, Niagara head coach Vilis Ozols left the school in the spring to take the same position at Siena, and Banks started to consider a transfer.\nShe was familiar with UTRGV coach Todd Lowery from her time on the RGV Venom travel team, so she said she never considered any other schools.\nJoining an experienced roster and playing tougher competition were both positives, and Banks said she also relished the opportunity to be closer to home. Her younger sister, Demy, is a junior playing middle blocker for McAllen Memorial, and her mom \u201cmakes some pretty good arroz con pollo,\u201d Banks said. At UTRGV, Banks can regularly play in front of friends and family, which was nearly impossible when she was almost 2,000 miles away at Niagara in Lewiston, New York.\nLowery said Banks has exuded many of those same qualities this season.

This is becoming par for the course. The Leftmedia tells Americans how to think; no nuance or caveat allowed. You either express your absolute hatred of neo-Nazi white supremacists or you are one. And if you\u2019re a Republican, you are one either way, they say.\nWe in our humble shop have been more than willing to call out Trump for foolish things he has said, but we find ourselves more often than not having to push back against and correct the mainstream media narrative. These pontificators \u2014 even some conservatives \u2014 have become so biased and hostile against Trump that they\u2019re unable to accurately and objectively report on what he says. It appears now more so than ever that the MSM\u2019s primary objective is to instruct Americans on what to think and not to report the news and trust Americans to freely come to their own conclusions. For the MSM, propaganda has replaced reporting.\nThe MSM\u2019s practice has been to intentionally conflate conservatives with white supremacists, and more specifically to tacitly suggest that anyone who voted for Trump is a closet racist. Secondly, the MSM has inferred that Trump, by defending the right of white supremacist groups to express their speech via protests, must secretly be in agreement with their views, irrespective of his repeated rejection of those views.\nThat last statement \u2014 \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d \u2014 was problematic in that it was easy to take out of context. But what Trump meant is where he ended up \u2014 that decent people come down on both sides of the statue debate. It was not decent people dominating either protest. His muddling of the point doesn\u2019t invalidate it. In any case, watching the press conference or reading all of Trump\u2019s remarks leaves one with a very different perspective than reading the Leftmedia\u2019s cherry-picked quotes.

One of them tells the interviewer he was under orders to try and assassinate an ISIS leader, but the name of the ISIS figure in question is edited out of the video.\nAfter what appears to be a scripted warning to others \"who want to come here and spy\" to \"repent to Allah now before it's too late,\" the setting in the video changes to an outdoor location where the men are seen kneeling with their backs to a bearded militant whom CBS News could not identify and a boy, who appeared to be less than 15 years old.\nBoth the adult jihadist and the boy appear to be of Asian descent. The man recites Quranic verse before saying: \"Allah has gifted the Islamic State's security agency with the apprehension of these two spies.\"\nHe says the men are \"now in the custody of the lion cubs of Khilafah,\" before prompting the boy to go ahead with the apparent execution with a pat on the shoulder.\nThe video, which is heavily edited and includes English subtitles throughout, then appears to show the boy shoot both men in the back of the head.\nNo blood can be seen on the bodies in the final shots of the purported execution sequence, and the video then transitions to a clip from an older video, released in Nov. 2014, in which the same boy is seen expressing aspirations to one day become a \"mujahid.\"\nThe older video shows the boy with other purported newcomers to ISIS territory, including many women and other children. The November video includes images from an ISIS religious school, where kids as young as six or seven are seen being groomed to become future militants for the group.\nCBS News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video released by ISIS, nor the identity of the men seen in it. CBS News was seeking comment from officials in Moscow.\nIn the meantime, Russian news agency RIA Novosti said a representative of the FSB told them it \"does not comment on the publication of the video executions allegedly of their agents by the members of the 'Islamic state.'\"\nISIS has executed scores of people in territory seized on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, including American and European journalists and aid workers, rival militia members and soldiers from both nations' armies."}

There you can find the \u201cNalaga\u2019at\u201d Center, the world\u2019s only professional deaf-blind acting ensemble. The theater is composed of 11 actors, most of them suffering from genetic disorder called Usher syndrome, which results in acute deafness at birth, followed by gradual loss of vision.\nNalaga\u2019at means \u201cDo Touch\u201d in Hebrew. \u201cBecause the actors of our show are blind and deaf, the way we communicate with them is by touch. We ask people who come to our center to communicate, to touch,\u201d says Jonathan Tomkins, Development Manager.\n\u201cNalaga\u2019at,\u201d a non-profit organization, was founded in order to integrate deaf-blind people into the community, giving them an opportunity to express themselves in a creative way and give their audience a meaningful experience. Besides its theatrical ensemble, the center also boasts two cafes; Caf\u00e9 Kapish \u2013 run completely by deaf waiters and the popular BlackOut, a pitch-black restaurant with blind waiters, where patrons are shown the menu in advance and call upon their waiters with the use of a bell.\nNalaga\u2019at was founded in 2002, when a social club for deaf-blind people approached the actress and director, Adina Tal and asked her to set a drama class for its members. \u201cAlthough I had no previous experience with the subject nor had ever closely known any deaf or blind person, not to mention any deaf-blind, I decided nonetheless to accept the challenge. The general expectation was merely to teach a drama course for several months. Little would I know that this interaction would change my life,\u201d says Tal, who is now president of Nalaga\u2019at.\nAfter a year of intense practicing and with the help of personal tactile-sign language interpreters, the first show was born: \u201cLight is Heard in Zig Zag.\u201d The play was performed at the Israeli Parliament, in Canada and even at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.\nFollowing this success, the \u201cNalaga\u2019at\u201d Center opened its gates to the public in 2007. Their second, and most successful play, entitled \u201cNot by Bread Alone\u201d has had150,000 viewers to date.\n\u201cNot by Bread Alone\u201d was performed in Israel, as well as at a London drama festival, with extremely positive critiques.

It makes people question me and my dog that went through extensive training with me. Those fakes dishonor those who need (the dogs) to survive.\"\nIn fact, I learned there's a whole fake service dog industry, if you want to call it that. You can go online and buy \"service dog\" harnesses and vests, even identification cards. As NBC News reported last year, \"there is no uniform nationwide certification or registration process for legitimate service animals \u2014 which receive up to several years of specialized training \u2014 making it easy for people to scam a non-existent system.\"\nAll because, as NBC News put it, pet owners \"want company running errands and going out.\"\nBut, in fact, many states are cracking down on fake service dogs. That includes Florida, where it's actually a second-degree misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500 or up to 60 days in jail, to misrepresent your pet as a service animal.\nThe state Legislature seems poised to take this even further: there's now a proposal to crack down on people who try to pass off their pets as \"emotional service animals\" to get out of paying pet deposits or get their pet into a condo or other building that prohibits animals.\nSo much fakery, just because we can't bear to leave Poochie-poo at home.\nBut again, let's not cast aspersions on the likes of Abrahamson, who depends on his service dog and is legally entitled to take the animal wherever he goes.\nWhat, in fact, does the law allow and not allow?\nFunny we should ask, as the Humane Society of the Treasure Coast is planning a free educational workshop at the Lyric Theatre in Stuart at 7 p.m. April 3, addressing this very issue.\nLaurie Volpe, a Humane Society volunteer who works with two different service dog organizations, will talk about state and federal laws governing which types of dogs can go where.\n\"We'll be talking about the difference between service dogs, therapy dogs and emotional support dogs,\" said Jessie Clifford, the society's director of Humane Education.\nFor example, service animals \u2014 defined as a dog trained to do work or perform specific tasks for an individual with a disability \u2014 are allowed anywhere that individual goes. Therapy dogs are different both in function and legality; they visit places like nursing homes or schools to comfort people, a noble task.\nBut neither therapy dogs nor emotional support animals have the same legal protections as service animals. Florida law doesn't require owners of public accommodations to let them in. And the federal Food and Drug Administration prohibits dogs and other animals from being in restaurants, grocery stores and other places where food is prepared \u2014 unless it's a trained service animal.\n\"We felt this was a huge opportunity to educate people,\" Clifford said.\nStill, I wonder how many people want to be educated.

Today, that figure is more than $15 billion a year, 17 times higher than and it was four decades ago, adjusting for inflation.\nBut to evaluate the true cost of the War on Drugs, the hundreds of thousands of fatalities from drug-related violence and drug overdoses in the last four decades have to be taken into consideration. The high casualty rate from drug-related violence and the persistence of widespread drug abuse has lead many to ask the question: Is the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d still worth fighting?\nChilean writer Ra\u00fal Rivera Andueza, whose latest book hails advancements in the war against drugs in Latin America, said in a recent interview that drug trafficking is more of a problem in the developed world than in Latin America, since citizens of developed countries are the primary consumers of a product their governments have declared illegal. His theory is based on the fact that neither the Cali nor the Ciudad Juarez cartels make as much money as the ones who sell drugs as middlemen on the streets of America.\nYet Latin American countries have paid a heavy price in the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d which has long been at the root of violence and political instability that still plagues the region. During the 1980s and 1990s, Colombia was the prime example of a Latin American country whose society and politics were transformed\u2014and pushed to the brink of collapse\u2014by drug trade. In the past decade, Mexico has arguably replaced Colombia in that role. Since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared war against the Ju\u00e1rez cartels, as well as criminal gangs like the Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, the country has experienced an unprecedented surge in violence. This has been exacerbated by the influx of guns from the United States, and the violence has also spilled over to Central America.\nIn my previous articles on this theme, many of the readers\u2019 comments called for the legalization of drugs in the United States. And it seems that the Global Commission on Drug Policy is listening to such arguments. Led by former presidents Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Cesar Gaviriaof Colombia,and Ernesto Zedilloof Mexico, the Commission argues that the War on Drugs has failed, pointing to the increasing consumption of opiates and cocaine worldwide\u201427 and 34 percent, respectively, between 1998 and 2008. A report issued by the Commission in June 2011 proposes the decriminalization of drugs, more investments in treatments for drug users, and an end to the criminalization and stigmatization of addiction. These measures, the report claims, would reduce prison overcrowding and diminish the devastating power of drug-trafficking cartels. These findings back up a study published by the RAND Corporation in 1997,which found that employing drug-user treatment to diminish consumption is seven times more cost-effective than law enforcement efforts alone.\nDrug legalization would have a few undeniable benefits. First, the United States government would save millions of dollars on law enforcement expenditures. Legalizing drugs would also allow the government to focus more on serious crimes instead of wasting time and money on incarcerating non-violent offenders. More funds would become available for rehabilitation programs in drug-ridden communities. Lastly, legal"}

{"idx": "35529", "prompt": "Continue the following text: For nearly four centuries, since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ended the Thirty Years\u2019 War in Europe, the concept of sovereignty \u2014 the right of countries to an independent existence and autonomy \u2014 has formed the core of the international order. And for good reason: As we have seen in century after century, including the current one, a world in which borders are forcibly violated is a world of instability and conflict.\nBut, in a globalized world, a global operating system premised solely on respect for sovereignty \u2014 call it World Order 1.0 \u2014 has become increasingly inadequate. Little stays local anymore. Just about anyone and anything, from tourists, terrorists and refugees to e-mails, diseases, dollars and greenhouse gases, can reach almost anywhere. The result is that what goes on inside a country can no longer be the concern of that country alone. Today\u2019s realities call for an updated operating system \u2014 World Order 2.0 \u2014 based on \u201csovereign obligation,\u201d the notion that sovereign states have not just rights but also obligations to others.\nWorld Order 2.0 must also include prohibitions on carrying out or in any way supporting terrorism. More controversially, it must include strengthened norms proscribing the spread or use of weapons of mass destruction. As it stands, while the world tends to agree on constraining proliferation by limiting countries\u2019 access to the relevant technology and material, the consensus often breaks down once proliferation has occurred. This should become a topic of discussion at bilateral and multilateral meetings, not because it would lead to a formal agreement, but because it would focus attention on applying stringent sanctions or undertaking military action, which could then reduce the odds of proliferation.\nAnother essential element of a new international order is cooperation on climate change, which may be the quintessential manifestation of globalization, because all countries are exposed to its effects, regardless of their contribution to it. The 2015 Paris climate agreement \u2014 in which governments agreed to limit their emissions and to provide resources to help poorer countries adapt \u2014 was a step in the right direction. Progress on this front must continue.\nCyberspace is the newest domain of international activity characterized by both cooperation and conflict. The goal in this area should be to create international arrangements that encourage benign uses of cyberspace and discourage malign uses. Governments would have to act consistently within this regime as part of their sovereign obligations \u2014 or face sanctions or retaliation.\nGlobal health presents a different set of challenges. In a globalized world, an outbreak of infectious disease in one country could quickly evolve into a serious threat to health elsewhere, as has happened in recent years with SARS, Ebola and Zika. Fortunately, the notion of sovereign obligation is already advanced in this sphere: Countries are responsible for trying to detect infectious disease outbreaks, responding appropriately and notifying others around the world.\nWhen it comes to refugees, there is no substitute for effective local action aimed at preventing situations that generate large refugee flows in the first place. In principle, this is an argument for humanitarian intervention in selective situations. But translating this principle into practice will remain difficult, given divergent political agendas and the high costs of effective intervention. Even without a consensus, however, there is a strong case for increasing funding for refugees, ensuring their humane treatment, and setting fair quotas for their resettlement.\nTrade agreements are, by definition, pacts of reciprocal sovereign obligations regarding tariff and nontariff barriers. When a party believes that obligations are not being met, it has recourse to arbitration through the World Trade Organization"}

He's donating his full paycheck to the #TimesUp movement, which was a big part of last Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony.\nWorking with his agents at WME, Wahlberg is doing some major damage control. The actor took some heavy hits on social media, after it was widely reported that his team at WME negotiated a $1.5 million pay day for reshoots that took place over this past Thanksgiving holiday. Director Ridley Scott only had ten days to shoot new scenes, which replaced disgraced actor Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plumber.\nThough it was said the actors were doing it for free, SAG rules demand that actors get paid for their work. And Michelle Williams took the lowest wage possible, taking in $800 for her time returning to set. Wahlberg on the other hand reportedly used a clause in his contact to obtain a way bigger pay day. He had final say on co-star approval, and he used this, with sources claiming he wouldn't okay Plummer until he was paid the $1.5 million, in a plot that mirrors what happens in the movie itself.\nNow, Wahlberg will donate all of his extra earnings to the #TimesUp movement, which will be done in Michelle Williams' name.

Local officials, key government staff and selected business and non-profit executives in the Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Opispo counties were invited. It was sponsored by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, commonly known as ICLEI.\nSeveral months ago, some citizens attending a San Luis Opispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) meeting asked about our political connection to ICLEI and were assured that, although SLOCOG had purchased and used their software in 2008, they no longer had a membership with ICLEI.\nYet, just two months ago, two of our county supervisors and Mayor Jan Marx signed an agreement at the symposium in Santa Barbara.\nTheir actions didn\u2019t seem merely ceremonial but a significant statement of their goals for SLO County\u2026 for all of us! So I decided to research ICLEI and found that it was launched in 1990 at the World Congress of Local Governments for A Sustainable Future and was instrumental in the development of United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development. (Research it yourself and you will see that these two organizations use the same language.) ICLEI even drafted Chapter 28 of the Sustainable Development workbook.\nSo what\u2019s so bad about ICLEI? A closer look at their goals and objectives will answer that. ICLEI communicates with local special interests to translate international policy into local and regional legislation. It\u2019s objectives presuppose the notion that legislation is the only method of improving the conditions or problems of the world. This notion denigrates the intelligence and ingenuity of local individuals (like you and me) and our ability to address problems of our own lives and property. We are marginalized and placed under increasing oversight of government planners.\nSo I am legitimately concerned that, on one hand, we\u2019re fed a denial of any influence of or involvement with ICLEI, and on the other hand, two supervisors and our mayor signed an agreement to promote its goals and objectives in our county.\nAlthough Sustainable Development is promoted as a war on pollution, it is increasingly clear that the \u201cenvironmental crises\u201d are simply the means to promote a political agenda \u2014 the restructuring of the governmental systems in all nations so the people of the world will be subjects of a global collective. Many of ICLEI\u2019s proposed implementation strategies require the surrender of our unalienable rights.\nSpeaking of rights, Harvey Ruvin, Vice Chair of ICLEI, has stated, \u201cIndividual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective\u201d in the implementation of Sustainable Development, whose premise is that individual human wants, needs and desires are to be conformed to the views and dictates of the community (Communitarianism).\nAs we continue to allow Sustainable Development, Smart Growth and other ICLEI doctrine to become our county\u2019s doctrine, these stated principles become inextricably woven into our local government, thereby supplanting our American Constitutional free enterprise system. By the way, the United Nations votes against the United States 70% \u2013 90% of the time! The UN and ICLEI are no friends of America.\nYou people need to sit back and look at how we are being treated/used, the gooberment doesn\u2019t want us to do anything,look at all the rules and regulations that keep getting passed on to us,no trucks and tractors older than a certain year can be used,so that means if your"}

With more than 30 years providing concrete design, installation and refurbishing services in Waukesha, Milwaukee and surrounding southeastern Wisconsin, JBS Construction has earned its reputation as the go-to company for concrete in Waukesha. From standard concrete services to magnificent decorative concrete designs, JBS Construction has a proven history of getting the best out of concrete. That is why JBS Construction has earned an A+ Rating from the Better Business Bureau.\nFamily-owned and operated, JBS Construction has always had one goal: To be the best concrete company in Waukesha. Building on their well-earned reputation and 30-year record of providing high-quality work at affordable rates, JBS Construction offers a full range of concrete design, installation and refurbishing services. Not only do they offer run-of-the-mill concrete services \u2014 like installation, repair and refurbishing of driveways and sidewalks\u2014 but they also offer competitive pricing on decorative concrete services \u2014 like colored, stamped, textured and acid stained concrete for cement retaining walls and patios. Whether they need help designing jaw-dropping hardscapes or just help repairing cement driveways that have started to split and crack, for high-quality concrete, Waukesha property owners know to call JBS Construction.\nLike many property owners with plain gray concrete, property owners often don\u2019t realize how versatile, affordable and low maintenance high-quality concrete can be. New technologies mean that decorative concrete options are now within the reach of middle income Americans, so even middle class families can have beautiful stone patios and eye-catching concrete driveways. And, when they choose concrete, property owners are choosing material that isn't just durable, it\u2019s easy to care for too. Unlike asphalt, which requires an annual sealing treatment to protect it, concrete is sealed once after installation. That\u2019s it. In fact, if a driveway is properly sealed and installed, it can last decades without warping and drooping the way asphalt driveways can.\nTo be sure that they receive top-quality services for design, installation and repair, residents are encouraged to only hire concrete experts who have extensive experience installing and caring for concrete. Property and home owners who opt for less experienced amateurs run the risk of hiring concrete contractors who might use inferior installation techniques that could lead to decreased durability of their concrete installation. For a first-class concrete company, Milwaukee, Waukesha, and all residents of southeastern Wisconsin know to call JBS Construction."}

I\u2019m referring to a very conflicted system of political campaign financing.\nThink about it. Had the insurance industry not been a major contributor, we'd have fixed our health care system years ago. Its biggest single problem is the huge portion of total health care costs \u2013 about 31 percent, according to a group called Physicians for a National Health Program and others \u2013 that are consumed by the insurance and billing bureaucracy without ever providing direct patient care. Costs for marketing, broker sales commissions, actuarial costs, gatekeepers, high executive salaries, increasing shareholder profits, even the high costs of their lobbying and campaign contributions are passed on to the patient (and in most cases employers, who have been taking their jobs offshore to avoid the costs).\nEliminate that waste and we could expand health care coverage to 100 percent of our people for the same dollars we spend to cover just 85 percent today.\nBut that means eliminating the very profitable yet wasteful insurance component, and the insurance industry will have nothing of that. So its executives are sending big cash dollars to the very state and federal politicians that can block or approve progress. They are bribing my representatives and yours to guard their own profits.\nThe media must not allow this process to go unchecked. When there is a political fight, it's usually because money is involved on one side or the other. And when it affects the public, that side generally has a lot of citizen volunteers with little cash fighting a goliath industry with lots of cash going to the politicians that pass the laws. The public's only equalizer is the press, and it too often ignores the driving force: money.\nPoliticians get offended when they hear charges of corruption. They seem to think they can continue representing \"us\" while receiving money from \"them.\" Robert Kennedy, Jr., calls it political treason, and he's not far off base.\nAs a former CEO, had I allowed my employees to accept money from vendors while giving away company assets, my company would have crashed and my employees put out of jobs. So how can our state and nation survive under this same kind of corruption?\nIt can't, and it is only a matter of time before Americans begin migrating to other countries to escape it. We are in a slow-motion spiral downward. Jobs are being outsourced daily and Americans will eventually follow them. We cannot survive as a consumer-only nation.\nHealth care is just one of many issues that are robbing our population of its resources.

Private interests are currently funding our public electoral system, the last place you would expect privatization and the free market to exist.\nFull public funding of political campaigns, like the system promoted by Public Campaign and Wisconsin Clean Elections Coalition, would cost $10 per taxpayer per year at the federal level and would eliminate the $300 billion per year the Feds give away to the special interests that currently fund the elections.

On Sunday, Page blasted an email to publishing representatives and members of the media saying that his own book, titled Politics, Lies, And The Wiretap: Inside The Fight To End The 70-Year Cold War, will \u201cprove infinitely more accurate, exciting and insightful\u201d than Comey\u2019s project.\nIn his book, Page promises to detail 10 hours of meetings between him and FBI agents in March of this year, during which he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The Washington Post reported the FBI interviews in June, and that Page had spoken to FBI agents without an attorney present.\nPage claims in the proposal that the conversations with FBI agents were a politically motivated \u201cwild goose chase,\u201d and that the agents became increasingly heated.\nThe book plans to trace Page\u2019s involvement with the Trump campaign, his trips to Russia, the dossier published by BuzzFeed News in January, the \u201cglory night\u201d of Trump\u2019s election win, and other topics.\nBut Page might have a difficult time securing offers from major publishing houses, publishing sources say.

Page told BuzzFeed News that he has fielded interest.\nHow exactly Page became part of the Trump campaign and how involved or limited his role really was remains something of a mystery. Page was booted from the campaign after reports emerged that federal investigators were looking into his ties to Russian officials. Since then, he's given many on-the-record interviews, including on television.\nIn April, BuzzFeed News reported that Page met with and passed documents to a Russian intelligence operative in New York in 2013.

Knowing I would be heading into so-called Trump territory, my friends had advised me to remove the \u201cTrump\u2019s last day\u201d sticker from my bike, which I did only reluctantly, replacing it with an American Flag.\nI met and interacted with a lot of interesting and friendly folks during my solo ride. Many wondered what this old man was doing riding across America on his little BMW. Some came to my aid in a few delicate situations, for which I will always be thankful. But, it was often obvious the political leanings of many, as topics such as the Kavanaugh confirmation came up, and quotes from Fox News were foremost in their minds. Many would relate a vacation experience or family connection to my home state. Interestingly, when pressed on where in Colorado I was from and I replied Boulder, often I could detect a look in their eyes and a stumble in the conversation. In one instance while having a friendly interaction with three riders from Kansas, one mumbled \u201cone of those liberals,\u201d then got up and walked away. Our local reputation has spread widely, if not entirely justified.\nI spent most my journey on backroads and touring small towns, avoiding cities and the texting drivers like the plague. The decay of small town America was obvious everywhere in towns with lovely turn-of-the-century architecture that gave way to empty storefronts and boarded-up windows. Try to imagine the Pearl Street Mall empty of life with plenty of parking.\nIt was obvious from the political signs that dotted the state and county highways that conservative candidates were very popular, many of which I was quite familiar with and revile for their divisive rhetoric. In my interactions, it became very clear that these folks shared many of the same values I hold dear \u2014 a good day\u2019s work, wanting what\u2019s best for their family, willingness to help a stranger, a desire for the opportunity to contribute and proud of where they come from, even if hard times along with questionable zoning decisions have made their town less than what it once was.\nI came home knowing we all share a lot of common concerns and values from which to rebuild our society in today\u2019s polarized political climate. Perhaps I am more hopeful now than I have been that with a little balance in Washington we can bridge some of the divide and reconstitute the American dream for us all.\nAlbert Petersen lives in Boulder."}

There were 20,770 in the country in 2008 and that was before hundreds of locations where closed by large car companies, particularly GM and Chrysler. The dealership count could be down by as much as 40% from 1970 if those closings are included.\nEmployment by car dealers could easily be down by 500,000 since 1970 and that assumes each dealer closed had only 50 employees. The rise in unemployment from shuttered company franchises is collateral damage from the huge hit industry unit sales have taken and competition from overseas, but that damage is almost certainly greater than most economists recognize.\nThe number of dealerships in the US is not likely to rise just as the number of blue-collar car workers at car companies is not likely to increase. Auto manufacturers have cut capacity to a level that gives them some flexibility in production in the event that sales rise, but the employment and factory cuts that The Big Three have made to improve margins are not going to be reversed. Large excesses in capacity almost ruined the US car industry and the companies in it are not going to make the mistake of increasing factory capacity again.\nAs dealer contracts with large car companies come up for renewal and auto companies are less inclined to give dealers financial support, the number of dealerships is likely to continue to fall."}

It was a symbolic cleansing of the past, but also the beginning of a very dark chapter for the band.\nThe four members of Fall Out Boy ultimately poured their energies into new musical projects. Andy Hurley and Joe Trohman formed the heavy metal supergroup the Damned Things with members of Anthrax and Every Time I Die. They released a well-received album in 2010, but they never got much traction. Wentz formed the dance music act Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha. They released an EP and toured a bit, but it too failed to take off in any meaningful way, and Rexha quietly left the group last year.\nPatrick Stump put resources into his 2011 solo debut Soul Punk.

{"idx": "35574", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The word \"peckerwood\" originated as an African-American slang term for \"woodpecker\" in the 1800s, but by the early 1900s began to be applied as a racial epithet against whites, with a meaning similar to the term \"white trash.\" In the second half of the 20th century, in prison environments in Texas, California, and possibly elsewhere, the word peckerwood, originally used to refer to white prisoners generally, began to develop a more specific association with members of racist prison gangs and cliques, as well as their associates and hangers-on. This association is strongest in California and Texas, and fairly strong across the West and South in general, but less common in the Midwest and Northeast. In California, the term spread from the prison to the streets in the form of so-called peckerwood gangs, white gangs that mix elements of street gang, prison gang, and racist skinhead gang. Their white supremacy is more often crude than sophisticated and they have a high association with traditional criminal activity, such as drugs. They tend to organize geographically, such as San Fernando Valley Peckerwoods, Inland Empire Peckerwoods, High Desert Peckerwoods, etc.\nSymbolically, the term peckerwood is often represented by various woodpecker images, sometimes in conjunction with other hate symbols. It is also common for white supremacists to use the word itself for a tattoo, or its common shortened version, \"Wood,\" as in \"100% Wood.\" Collectively, peckerwoods in a particular prison or geographic range are often called the \"Woodpile.\" Female peckerwoods are referred to as \"featherwoods.\""}

You're trying to convince an employer of your discipline and production. You're misplacing phone numbers, forgetting names, and missing appointments. You are losing the job search game. People will say,\"... don't sweat the little stuff.\" But it's the little stuff obstructing the correct view of us that is making us look clumsy and incompetent. That's why details matter.\n1. People's names. How many of us are terrible with names but great with faces? Well, since we can't follow up with faces, names are critical to document or remember. We have more than just phone numbers to contact people, and there's always Google and social media to use. If you're bad at remembering names and faces, look up Jerry Lucas on Amazon and his books on memory. I remember many years ago how he recognized everyone in the audience on the Johnny Carson show after meeting each person the first time. I read his book Lucas authored with Harry Lorayne (the link goes to Google Books, The Memory Book) many years ago and still use a couple of their principles in remembering phone numbers. It works, and I highly recommend them.\n2. Losing phone numbers. What's worse is when people lose their phones and use their Facebook page to recoup misplaced phone numbers. If you don't use your Gmail contact list regularly, you should. It's a free cloud service used by millions. But if you want to \"level-up\" your contact game, use the app Evercontact to update contacts by contacting you via email. I'm still playing with it, but so far I find it useful in detecting a connection who has updated his or her information without notifying me.\n3. You were supposed to call when? Yes, we forget, and scheduling is an issue, but when every phone has a calendar there is no excuse. Many of us use Evernote but don't use the alarm feature in the app. There are too many solutions tools to use already in your smartphone to employ right now. But little things such as forgetting to call a certain or time could mean everything to lose when you're trying to move forward.\n4. How you treat everyone. Job seekers who are good networkers masterfully leverage kindness, courteousness, and helpfulness. They understand people associate how they remember you with how you made them feel the last time they met you. How can you expect referrals if they don't feel you're genuine. People refer others they feel good about and who treat them well.\n5. A smile or lack thereof. Employers want to see enthusiasm, and if you're so enthusiastic, how is it supposed to be shown? It's not a signal you're desperate for the job, or you can't wait to accept. It's part of putting forth your best effort, and you're excited to engage in the discussion.\n6. Preparation. You want to treat this on the same level as an interview. Some will say that this approach is over-the-top. It's necessary for the person referring you to demonstrate excitement as much as you will.\n7. The right phone numbers. I find it easier to use my phone as the hub of organization these days. There are too many tools to ignore to keep you organized and on schedule. If you need help with maintaining business card info, the one app you should have on your phone is ABBY Business Card Reader.

Following the Allied occupation of Berlin, Brigadier Sir Ralph Rayner entered the city and was given a tour by the Soviets. Purportedly, they offered him Eva Braun\u2019s phone as a souvenir, but eventually offered him this one instead, when he claimed his favorite color was red.\nThat phone went home with him, and Rayner continued as a British politician after the war. When he eventually died in 1977, the phone was passed on to his son, Ranulf, who is now auctioning off the one-of-a-kind artifact because the insurance costs for it have become too great. He hopes that a museum will purchase it and preserve it for posterity.\nIn his interview video, Ranulf explains that Hitler used the phone as a portable device, taking it everywhere with him. It was used not only in the bunker, but in trains and cars and in his field headquarters. As the auction listing points out, an argument could be made that this phone is one of the most macabre historical pieces in the world, having borne the wishes of a man who ordered the extermination of millions.\nTo confirm the device\u2019s authenticity, the auctioneers have collated reports from Hitler\u2019s own personal telephonist, as well as historical images of Brigadier Rayner and the handset in newspapers and private collections.\nAlong with the handset itself, the lot comes with the original case that Sir Rayner used to bring the phone back from Germany, along with some of its wartime tags and stickers."}

In this geometrical model (The Hypergeometrical Universe), electron,proton,positron and antiproton are just the four phases of a fundamental dilator. This fundamental dilator is a coherence between deformation states of a 4D space metric in a Five Dimensional Spacetime. All particles (isotopes and hypernuclei) where casted as more complex deformational coherences.\nThese deformational coherences, if one makes the analogy between deforming space and sound, are equivalent to a music score composed of one or several four notes chords. In addition, there is a new proposed topology for the Universe, in which the 3D Universe is modeled as a lighspeed expanding hyperspherical shell (a shockwave Universe).\nThese two ideas together allow for the envisioning of a new way to create nuclear fusion: Coherent Nuclear Fusion. Under this approach, the nuclear chemistry paradigm is changed into a Nonlinear Hadronics paradigm similar to nonlinear optics.

In May, the administration announced a plan for the nation's first greenhouse gas pollution standard for autos. Clean air and clean water are priorities for this EPA, and it's expected to propose new regulations on coal combustion waste by the year's end.\nSome of new rules are the result of the changing of the political guard. Others are the result of court decisions. And they all have business groups nervous.\nForbes spoke with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson about her plans for the agency and what they might regulate next.\nThis year we've seen a very active EPA. Should businesses be worried about more regulation or over-regulation?\nLisa Jackson: I hope the message for businesses is clear that the Obama EPA will take very seriously its responsibility to use the laws that are on the books, and either enforce them or interpret them in ways that are protective of human health and the environment.\nI think it's fair to say that, yes, we will be putting out more rules. In many cases, they are rules that were either overturned by the courts, or that we agreed to review because they were put out at the last minute by the last administration.\nWhat's the likelihood that the EPA will act on the endangerment finding if Congress doesn't act this year?\nmonths. I don't want to give a number.\nIf Congress hasn't acted by the time of the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December, does that put pressure on EPA to put something in place?\nI don't think that Copenhagen is putting pressure on the EPA. One of the big reactions to the Endangerment Finding was international, where people said \"Hey, this is the first time the U.S. government is speaking on the issue of greenhouse gases in terms of their endangerment to public health and welfare.\nWould you describe this as an activist EPA?\nI would definitely describe it as an active EPA. And proactive. \"Activist\" calls to mind the idea that we only have one point of view. What I've said is that we have to be driven by science and the law. The laws that we have in this country to govern environmental matters are extremely powerful, and in many cases just need to be used and used consistently. Maybe progressive would be a word I feel more comfortable with.\nYou've said that the president's budget includes investments to develop \"environmentally and economically sound\" to reduce GHG emissions without harming small businesses. An example?\nThe first place I'd start is the greenhouse gas reporting rule [proposed in March]. [It] requires reporting by sources above 25,000 tons per year, which we estimated would capture about 80+ percentage of the emissions in the country but would do so by leaving out virtually all small businesses.\nThere continue to be lots and lots of horror stories about an EPA run amok that will tax and control everything. The charge, sadly, is usually that business says this is going to bankrupt the economy, and we say that it's not. And the history shows that we're most often right.

{"idx": "35591", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The reigning theory in business has long been that \"alpha\" leaders make the best entrepreneurs. These are aggressive, results-driven achievers who assert control, and insist on a hierarchical organizational model. Yet I am seeing more and more success from \"beta\" startup cultures, like Zappos and Amazon, where the emphasis is on collaboration, curation, and communication.\nSome argue that this new horizontal culture is being driven by Gen-Y, whose focus has always been more communitarian. Other business culture experts, like Dr. Dana Ardi, in her new book \"The Fall of the Alphas,\" argues that the rise of the betas is really part of a broader culture change driven by the Internet, towards communities, instant communication, and collaboration.\nDo away with archaic command-and-control models. Winning startups today are horizontal, not hierarchical. Everyone who works there feels they're part of something, and moreover, that it's the next big thing. They want to be on the cutting-edge of all the people, places and things that technology is going to propel next.\nLeaders of tomorrow need to practice ego management. They should be aware of their own biases, and focus on the present as on the future. They need to manage the egos of team members, by rewarding collaborative behavior. There will always be the need for decisive leadership, particularly in times of crisis, so I'm not suggesting total democracy.\nWinning contemporary startups stress innovation. Betas believe that team members need to be given an opportunity to make a difference - to give input into key decisions and to communicate their findings and learnings to one another. Encourage team-members to play to their own strengths so that the entire team and organization leads the competition.\nPut a premium on collaboration and teamwork. Instead of knives-out competition, these companies thrive by building a successful community with shared values. Team members are empowered and encouraged to express themselves. The best teams are hired with collaboration in mind. The whole is thus more than the sum of the parts.\nIn the most winning companies, everyone shares the culture. Leadership is fluid and bend-able. Integrity and character matter a lot. Everyone knows about the culture. Everyone subscribes to the culture. Everyone recognizes both its passion and its nuance. The result looks more like a symphony orchestra and less like an advancing army.\nRoles, identities and responsibilities mutate weekly, daily, and even hourly. One of the big mistakes entrepreneurs make is they don't act quickly enough. Markets and needs change quickly. Now there is a focus on social, global and environmental responsibility. Hierarchies make it hard to adjust positions or redefine roles. The beta culture gets it done.\nTemper self-esteem and confidence with empathy and compassion. Mindfulness, of self and others, by boards, executives and employees, may very well be the single most important trait of a successful company. If someone is not a good cultural fit, or is not getting it done, make the change quickly, but with sensitivity. Pain increases over time.\nEvery individual in the organization is a contributor. The closer everyone in the organization comes to achieving his or her singular potential, the more successful the business will be. Successful cultures encourage their employees to keep refreshing their toolkits, keep flexible, keep their stakes in the stream.\nDiversity of thought, style, approach and background is key. Entrepreneurs build teams, not fill positions. Cherry-picking candidates from name-brand universities will do nothing to further an organization and may even work against it.

After a few days of walking, three other adults joined and they made the more than 1,000-mile journey to Texas on foot. He kept getting handed off to different coyotes at different points along the journey and new people joined them. But one thing was constant. From the time a coyote woke him every morning until sundown, they walked. \"It was very tiring, we had to walk so much. I was always tired.\" His sneakers got worn out but he didn't complain. He wanted to be obedient. Finally, a coyote gave him another pair. Fernando says the hope of seeing his mother after more than four years apart kept him going.\nHe was picked up by \"the police\" at the border and moved to McAllen in Texas (he pronounces it \"TAYX-us\"), the largest immigration processing center in the U.S. He stayed with other children in an enclosure made of chain link fence. But he was soon transferred to another shelter where he took classes in English and math. One day, someone came and taught Fernando and other children how to bake a cake. There was always a \"mister\" close by. There were many rules\u2014no hugging, no touching, no joking, no running, and always be respectful to the adults in charge. \"They told us first it would be a verbal warning and then they would make a report and it would affect our legal case.\" So even though it was against his nature, Fernando didn't make friends with the other boys. Every day, he waited until evening when he could go outside and play soccer. Even then, he tried to be as quiet as possible.\nIn Guatemala, Fernando's life was simple. He lived with his grandmother in a village and his father visited from the city every month. As he talks about his abuela, his eyes fill with tears. He says he misses everything about her. \"She loved me a lot. She would look after me when I fell sick, she always took care of me.\" He tries not to think about his best friends back home and their dreams of becoming futbolistas or the personal treasures he left behind. A ring, a chain, his baby photos.\nAbout two or three months ago, Fernando reunited with his mother. He said it was \"special\" and they hugged each other. His mother cried a lot.

The guides argued that the Salmon was a ''navigable'' waterway -- a designation that allows access by boaters and canoeists, and has traditionally implied fishing rights. The case wended its way through two lower courts before a Court of Appeals finally ruled that while navigability did include a right of passage by boaters, it did not include a right to fish.\nIn a written opinion, Judge Joseph Bellacosa stated, ''The longstanding public easement of navigation in navigable-in-fact rivers does not sweep away or displace other rights . . . including that of exclusive fishery.'' In one fell swoop, the decision jeopardized decades of work by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\nAccording to Yvonne Kopy of the New York State chapter of the Fisheries Defense Fund, anglers have already begun feeling the effects of the court ruling. Kopy cited an example along Johnson Creek in Point Breeze, where a property owner levies a fee to fish for that stream's monster brown trout -- again stocked with state funds. The owner has even hired wardens to patrol his section of the river.\nShe also heard from bass anglers who had been chased from casting under docks after launching their boat at a public launch ramp.\nJust last month, a Pennsylvania court considered a case involving an angler arrested after wading onto a private stretch of the Lehigh River owned by a fishing club. After key testimony by Pennsylvania's Fish and Boat Commission and others, the court ruled the Lehigh navigable, and therefore fishable by the public.\nBut relief may be on the way for New York anglers in the form of legislation proposed by Assemblyman Alexander B. Pete Grannis. His bill, set to go before the Assembly in this session, would essentially overturn the Court of Appeals ruling by including the right to fish under the legal definition of navigable.\nWith Governor George E. Pataki recently championing the right of public access on the Hudson River over lands owned by Metro North, Grannis is hoping the climate is right to move his bill forward. Perhaps then the state's 1.1 million licensed anglers who don't own private water but do spend some $15 million in license fees can breathe a collective sigh of relief."}

Higher upfront costs, and expensive maintenance involved with this business model of the accounting software buoyed the small and medium enterprises to implement this software. The rapid expansion of cloud-based services later on paved the way for development of a highly dynamic and competitive software industry. Advent of cloud in the financial accounting software changed the business dynamics as the SMEs showed high interest in the implementations of these software owing to the cost saving achieved with the cloud based model. Other factors such as high availability, and reforming customer expectations around the world impact the financial accounting software market globally.\nThese factors have propelled accelerated product innovations and enhancements in the recent times. Among the cloud-based accounting software providers, free business models as well as micro-job solutions are gaining higher prominence by the end-user sectors. Also, personalization coupled with data driven insights, augmented with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are anticipated to transform the financial management industry completely in the coming few years.\nAPAC is expected to be the fastest growing region in the financial accounting software market.

It is widely believed that Mr. Brunson\u2019s alleged 23 years of \u2018missionary work\u2019 is but a smoke screen for spying.\nPresident Erdogan has just declared he would look out for new friends, including new trading partners in the east \u2013 Russia, China, Iran, Ukraine, even the unviable EU, and that his country is planning on issuing Yuan-denominated bonds to diversify Turkey\u2019s economy, foremost the country\u2019s reserves and gradually moving away from the dollar hegemony.\nLooking out for new friends, may also include new military alliances. Is Turkey planning to exit NATO? Would turkey be \u2018allowed\u2019 to exit NATO given its strategic maritime and land position between east and west?

Despite watching Bortles' best season protecting the ball, it was not good enough for Doug Marrone.\n\"Zero turnovers,\" Marrone said earlier this week when asked what he wants to see most from Bortles, via The Florida Times-Union. \"I mean really, and I say that with anyone on our team that touches the football. That's the one thing that is the biggest cause of winning and losing games. I think that we talk about ball security and that's not just for a quarterback, but for our receivers, our tight ends, running backs, all the time. When you turn the ball over, it's hard to win football games.\"\nMarrone would like zero turnovers in 2018. I would like gold coins to rain from the sky, 14 Maseratis to magically appear in my garage and world peace. I think we're both going to be disappointed.\n\"Zero\" interceptions is an unrealistic number for any quarterback. Aaron Rodgers, who owns the lowest interception per pass rate in NFL history at 1.6 percent, has never thrown fewer than five in a season since he earned the starting job.\nMarrone, however, doubled down on his point that the quarterback must negate turnovers.\nWhen asked if he'd trade 15 additional touchdown passes from Bortles if that meant five more INTs than last season, the coach responded, \"No.\"\n\"Because I know the turnovers will lead to wins and losses more than the touchdowns,\" Marrone said. \"Now if you said 15-game winning streak, I'll take that. How's that?\"\nMarrone's point is obvious: turnovers lose games.\nBortles' best statistical season came in 2015, in which he threw for 4,428 yards and 35 touchdowns. The QB also turned the ball over 23 times, including 18 interceptions. The Jags won just five games that season.\nOne question with Marrone's zero-sum approach is balancing the desire to negate turnovers with becoming a stagnant, predictable offense that takes no chances and ties the hands of his QB.\nDuring certain points last season, the coaching staff didn't trust Bortles in key moments not to make a mistake. It was an issue that Jalen Ramsey pointed out earlier this offseason. Saying his quarterback can't make any turnovers only heightens the pressure on Bortles to be perfect whenever coaches bless him with the chance to do his job. That type of pressure can be crippling.\nIt would be interesting to get Tom Coughlin's take on a quarterback throwing for \"zero\" interceptions, considering his most successful runs as a coach came with Eli Manning, one of the most turnover-prone quarterbacks in the NFL who at his best took chances down the field."}

All Rights Reserved.\nAstronomers have just discovered the first \"circumbinary planet.\" Like Luke Skywalker's home planet of Tatooine in the \"Star Wars\" films, this strange world, labeled Kepler-16b, orbits two closely spaced suns.\nWhat would such a planet be like? For that matter, what if Earth had two suns instead of one? Alan Boss, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., is a member of the Kepler-16b discovery team. He describes the scenery on the Tatooine-like planet, and how Earth would fare in such a binary star system.\nFirst off, on Kepler-16b \"it's a little frosty,\" Boss said. \"Though it is closer to its stars than Earth is to the sun, the stars aren't quite so bright, so the temperature of this planet would only be about 200 Kelvin,\" or nearly minus-100 Fahrenheit.\nEarth would be even chillier under the same stellar circumstances. \"If you replaced our sun with those stars, we would be even colder than 200 Kelvin, because we're farther out than this Tatooine-like planet,\" he told Life's Little Mysteries, a sister site to SPACE.com.\nIn such a frigid environment, all Earth's water would be frozen, and Boss strongly doubts life would have arisen here. Earth under two suns \"is not a habitable planet \u2014 unless you had an advanced life form that originated elsewhere that could keep itself warm.\"\nOrbiting these two stars, Earth's year would be longer than 365 days, he said, but not by much: \"One star in the [Kepler] binary system has a mass 20 percent of the mass of the sun, and the other is 70 percent the mass of the sun. Together their masses only differ from our sun by 10 percent. This would make the year on Earth slightly longer, because the gravity of the stars pulling us inward would be lower, so there's less centrifugal force and we would orbit around slower,\" Boss said.\nThe length of a day on our planet wouldn't necessarily change, as long as our moon had still formed and its orbit stayed the same, he said.\nPerhaps the best aspect of a circumbinary planet would be the view. Boss said the sunset on Kepler-16b or a circumbinary Earth would look very much like the fictional Tatooine sunset in \"Star Wars IV: A New Hope.\" \"In that film, Luke looks up and sees the two stars setting. They would not be quite so large in the sky as in the film, but you would see two differently colored stars close together without touching.\n\"So the 'Star Wars' image is not that far off.\"\nThis article was provided by Life's Little Mysteries, a sister site to SPACE.com.

Kerry had said then that \u201cquestions surrounding Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons programme\u201d had to be \u201cresolved\u201d.\nAlong with Kerry\u2019s initial adoption of the \u201ccome clean\u201d rhetoric, these sharp criticisms of the U.S. refusal to call explicitly for a confession indicate that the Obama administration had initially went along with Israel\u2019s in calling for Iran to \u201ccome clean\u201d, but concluded that such a demand risked a premature breakdown in the talks.\nA former U.S. official who had worked on Iran suggested in a recent off-the-record meeting that the \u201cpossible military dimensions\u201d issue could not be resolved completely, but that one or more parts could be clarified satisfactorily. The rest could be left for resolution by the IAEA after the comprehensive agreement is signed, the ex-official said.\nThat possibility arises because Iran and the IAEA agreed in February to work on the \u201cExploding Bridgewire\u201d (EBW) issue \u2013 the claim published by the IAEA that Iran had carried out experiments on high explosives developed for the purpose of detonating a nuclear weapon.\nThat claim was based on a document that was part of the large collection originally said by anonymous intelligence sources to have come from the laptop computer of a participant in a purported Iranian nuclear weapons research project.\nThe documents were actually turned over to German intelligence by the Iranian terrorist organisation"}

He recommended that people \"study Torah, engage in good deeds, repent, observe Shabbat, and know the entire Halacha, and thanks to this God will apply a full recovery.\"\nOn Friday, a day after fires began blazing on the Mount Carmel range, ultra-Orthodox newspapers called for self-scrutiny, saying the disaster was a sign from God.\nIn its editorial, haredi paper Hamodia said the Carmel wildfires demanded that the people of Israel scrutinize their acts and ask themselves if they caused the disaster.\nUnder the title \"Who by Fire,\" the editorial said this was the time for each and every one to look inward and do what is required to improve their lives.\nTo touch its readers, the paper quoted two phrases from the Yom Kippur liturgy, \"Unetanneh Tokef\", according to which each one will be judged on the Day of Judgment \u2013 \"who will live\" and \"who will die.\"\nThe Hamevaser newspaper wrote that an investigation committee would probably be set up, but said we must not forget that there are things beyond human control. The editorial noted that in legal language it is known as \"force majeure,\" and that we know there is a directing force from above without whom it is impossible to even lift a finger \"here below.\" The Heavens caused the events and lead them to such disastrous levels, the editorial claimed.\n\"The warning sign sent (Thursday) from above joins the previous warning sign, when we are already in the midst of drought, after a number of years of insufficient rain,\" according to the editorial. \"These warning signs are sent to wake us, to prod the sleeping from their sleep\u2026 Each one must come to conclusions and drive crookedness from his heart\u2026 And just as in the days of High Priest Mattathias Ben Yohanan made miracles and wonders (from the Hanukkah story), also in our time, He will save us from the darkest hours.\"\nIn many cases haredi news channels tend to ignore major news events, especially in crime, for educational reasons. However, they were not indifferent to the human tragedy of the bus carrying prison services cadets and the fires still blazing in some areas of the Carmel Forest.\nLithuanian haredi newspaper Yated Ne'eman dedicated nearly all its news pages to the Carmel fires, and both Hamodia and Hamevaser covered the tragedy extensively.\nIn addition to regular updates, various particularly Jewish points of view were presented, including a red headline over the evacuation of Torah scrolls from the religious kibbutz Nir Etzion, and the instructions of Torah scholars to perform prayer vigils and laments in the yeshivas to invoke heavenly mercy.\nSee all talkbacks \"Carmel wildfire punishment from God? \""}

It didn't enter classic territory but the match was keenly contested throughout, the teams tied on eight occasions and providing plenty of drama.\nThey will have to meet again to decide the destination of the title, with Cuala the more fortunate to be getting another opportunity. In normal time Na Piarsaigh looked to have claimed a courageous win, leading by three points with the match in injury-time, having faced the strong wind for the second half after leading by just two points at the interval. But a foul on Colm Cronin left Cuala with one last chance. Sean Moran stepped up to the 20m free and found the net, sending the match to extra-time.\nBefore that Shane Dowling missed a free near the end of normal time which would have made the match safe, but Na Piarsaigh still looked poised to regain their title until Moran's intercession. Leading 0-8 to 0-6 heading at half-time, an early second-half goal from Peter Casey gave them impetus, leaving them four points up. But Cuala took over control of the match for a spell. Between the 37th minute and the 43rd they ran off five scores in a row to lead for the first time since early in the match.\nCon O'Callaghan scored just one point, in extra-time, as did Mark Schutte, although both were involved in winning frees which Treacy converted. Cuala's top scorer didn't miss any of his 12 free attempts and severely punished Na Piarsaigh indiscipline. But the Limerick side also defended well, denying Cuala a goal from open play, and allowing them just one half goal chance, from Schutte early in the match. Mike Casey did an excellent job in restraining O'Callaghan for the most part.\nPlaying with the strong wind, Na Piarsaigh, champions in 2016, were slow to settle, scoring only once in the opening quarter hour, with Cuala building a 0-4 to 0-1 lead. O'Callaghan was fouled for two of Treacy's four first-half frees, the first in the third minute opening the scoring, Colm Cronin doubling their advantage two minutes later.\nKevin Downes, who had a fierce battle for much of the game with Cian O'Callaghan, got Na Piarsaigh off the mark in the seventh minute but it took another nine minutes before they managed to score again. Downes had an excellent match, scoring four points play and always there when his side needed leadership against a tight-marking Cuala defence in which Paul Schutte was outstanding.\nHaving taken time to ignite, Na Piarsaigh snapped to life with three scores in two minutes heading into the second quarter, Casey hitting a sublime score under pressure from John Sheanon, quickly followed by one from Dowling, before Downes fielded Casey's delivery and pointed in the 18th minute.

Zaillian, on the other hand, said the mystery definitely interested him, and \"I think that's why we complement each other well.\" Zaillian had completed a draft of the script before Fincher signed on, but together they had \"many , many conversations\" to hammer things out, including a focus on stripping the dialogue down to a bare minimum. For more on how Zaillian changed the story-- including a few POTENTIAL SPOILERS-- read ahead. The interview won't make much sense to you if you haven't read the book or seen the movie anyway, so pick this up once you've seen The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, in theaters everywhere now.\nIf you want a more detailed discussion of the different versions of the story, read our full book to movie comparison.\nThere's so much dialogue in the book, even just with all the Vanger family tree stuff.

Leaders there held out hope they could to get it done Thursday night but ran into procedural hurdles. Lawmakers in both parties hoped to get an early start bragging about a rare accomplishment four months before the election.\nThe conservative Heritage Action for America and the anti-tax Club for Growth urged a 'no' vote on the bill in emails Thursday to lawmakers, warning that it will be counted as a key vote on their legislative scorecards.\n\"This massive bill spends too much money, will continue taxpayer bailouts for highway spending, and keeps subsidies that have contributed directly to skyrocketing tuition rates,\" Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller said.\nDespite the backlash from such core conservative groups, the bill's supporters expressed confidence. \"We got a pretty good reception in conference this morning,\" Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania said after House Republicans met on the bill.\nAfter three months of haggling, House and Senate negotiators reached agreement on the package Wednesday. It includes a two-year, $100 billion spending plan for highway and mass transit construction and repairs, $6 billion to prevent rates on new student loans after June 30 from doubling, and a five-year renewal of federal flood insurance subsidies.\nThe bill gives states more flexibility over how they spend federal highway aid, consolidates transportation programs and shortens environmental delays to get highway projects built faster.

Republicans sacrificed proposals to force a go-ahead with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline in the Midwest and to prevent the Obama administration from regulating coal ash as a hazardous toxin.

But, regular emotional eating can jeopardize your diet cycle and cause various health problems.\nAnxiety is the feeling of uneasiness, fear and insecurity when in reality there is nothing to be afraid of. Fear normally disappears after the danger is gone, but anxiety persists without any apparent danger. Fear, or mild anticipatory anxiety is normal emotion, leading to adaptive behaviour. But when the fear-provoking situation becomes long-standing, it causes harm to the body. Long lasting anxiety becomes stressful for the body, leading to medical problems when it is persistent and interferes with normal daily activities or harms physical health.\nWhat are the causes of Anxiety?\nAnxiety can vary from a mild, nagging feeling to extreme panic. It may start with a difficult or painful experience. Older people may have anxiety associated with loss of status after retirement, bereavement, ill health, or financial worries. It can also be brought on by the use of alcohol or drugs, too much coffee, or certain medicines. It could also be a symptom of depression or other mental illnesses.\nThe symptoms include flushing, sweating, shortness of breath, rapid breathing or a feeling of choking. There could be trembling, frequent urination, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation. Tension, inability to relax, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, sleeplessness or sexual difficulties may also occur.\nMild cases of anxiety could be discovered during a medical check- up or while investigating other medical problems. Severe anxiety-panic attacks generally cause people to seek medical help, as the symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack. The doctor will discuss the problems and circumstances that act as a trigger for the anxiety attack.\nWhat is the treatment of Anxiety?\nThe doctor will treat any underlying disease. Alcohol, coffee and cola drinks should be avoided. The doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce anxiety. Psychotherapy may help to cope with the situation. Relaxation techniques, meditation and yoga help to reduce the anxiety. Getting enough rest during the day, as well as a good night\u2019s sleep can help."}

Thus, the use of stories may be a pathway to enhanced reflective practice and clinical reasoning skills. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether and how digital storytelling can contribute to occupational therapy (OT) students\u2019 learning through reflections on experiences from placement education. A cohort of OT students (n = 57) participated in a 2-day workshop to create digital stories. Data were generated through a questionnaire with a response rate of 100% of students who completed the workshop (n = 34). Quantitative analysis methods were used to reveal a level of agreement in the questionnaire statements, and qualitative content analysis was performed for the open-ended questions.\nThe results show that the students learned through reflection on placement experiences in the digital storytelling process as they emphasized reflection as a main outcome. They highlighted the importance of sharing thoughts and reflections with peers. The students confirmed that this happens through the creative process and the use of multimodality in poetic reflection, but they were less convinced by the use of the narrative approach as a dramatic structure. The students experienced reflection and sharing as important elements in the digital storytelling process. However, investigations are needed into the use of a narrative approach to enhance reflection with larger cohorts as well as more thematic analyses.\nSkarpaas, Lisebet S.; Jamissen, Grete; Kr\u00fcger, Cecilie; Holmberg, Vigdis; and Hardy, Pip (2016) \"Digital Storytelling as Poetic Reflection in Occupational Therapy Education: An Empirical Study,\" The Open Journal of Occupational Therapy: Vol. 4: Iss. 3, Article 5."}

Research has established that DBT appears to help reduce some of the worst problems associated with BPD (such as repeated suicidal behaviors, therapy interfering behaviors, etc.).\nIf you want more information about DBT, consider starting with Wikipedia. In addition, Marsha Linehan, Ph.D. among others have since written a number of great books for professionals and laypersons alike which you can look up on Amazon. We included many elements of DBT in our book Borderline Personality Disorder For Dummies although we mostly tried to integrate the best techniques we could find from everywhere.\nAs we\u2019ve spoken to various groups of professionals, therapists, and the public, we\u2019ve noticed that many folks simply don\u2019t understand what the term dialectical means or why it could be important. Interestingly, Dr. Linehan herself has said at a few recent workshops that DBT can now be thought of as Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) since the more general field of CBT has so thoroughly accepted and integrated the idea of dialectics in its latest iterations. And we think she\u2019s probably right. But that still begs the question: What the heck does dialectical mean anyway? In brief, dialectics represent the mind\u2019s way of understanding concepts by understanding and appreciating their polar opposites.\nDialectics are one of the important unifying concepts that reflect how the mind fundamentally understands and perceives most core concepts and ideas. And the field of psychology contains an abundance of such concepts, including self esteem, trust, courage, honesty, rage, passivity, withdrawal, impulsivity, inhibition, blameworthiness, guilt, risk taking, and on and on. Dialectics are based in part on the fact that we cannot fully understand any of these abstract concepts without appreciating that they consist of bipolar opposites with a higher level of integration somewhere in between them.\n\u2022 Usually, the best time to invest is when almost everyone is so afraid that they advise against doing so.\n\u2022 The more you focus on the needs of other people, the less you\u2019ll have available to meet their needs.\n\u2022 Freedom actually increases from having rules and limits.\n\u2022 The more you rebel against others (parents, loved ones, etc.), the more you will allow them to control you.\n\u2022 The more you argue for your position, the less you will be heard.\n\u2022 The more you absolutely must have someone, the less likely they\u2019ll end up wanting you.\n\u2022 As we make new medical advances, many of these are creating even harder to treat diseases (see information about antibiotics resistant to most known drugs).\n\u2022 People who feel unworthy of having their needs met vs. those who feel overly entitled both often cause people to avoid meeting their needs.\n\u2022 People who are fearful and anxious of attaching to others (due to their sense of inferiority) versus those who avoid attachments (out of a belief in their own superiority and disdain for others) generally end up estranged with unfulfilling relationships.\n\u2022 People who feel overly dependent on others vs. those who feel driven to be independent at all times often fail to obtain useful help when it would come in handy.\n\u2022 People tend to throw blame at folks who either feel blameworthy at all times as well as those who fail to accept appropriate blame."}

That wasn't abnormal.\nDoing it after a loss was.\n\"Got to sit back and relax and re-focus,\" Brown droned, head down and hands clasped. \"Find out what went wrong and fix it.\"\nWhen discussing South Carolina's offensive line, that's a lot easier said than done. In a 17-6 loss to Vanderbilt last week, it was simple to find out what went wrong.\nThe line has been struggling all year, but it wasn't a big concern for two reasons. One, Hunt's lines in his previous two years always struggled before hitting their stride mid-year. Two, the Gamecocks were winning in spite of it.\nBut against the Commodores, USC gave up seven sacks, improving its SEC-worst total to 26. Brown, Seaver Brown, Jamon Meredith (twice) and Justin Sorensen also false-started, giving Vandy 25 free yards.\nThe loss knocked USC out of the Top 10 and gave coach Steve Spurrier his first defeat to Vandy in 15 tries. It also re-started the same cycle -- with no protection, USC's quarterbacks couldn't get in a rhythm, so Spurrier again started playing with the constant yo-yo that is the Gamecocks' starting signal-caller.\nNo matter which QB Spurrier selects -- Chris Smelley re-won the job -- he can't be expected to do much if the line can't give him room to set and throw. Spurrier has mentioned the memory of Syvelle Newton, the mobile QB who saved the line and the team a lot of grief last year, more and more as the season's progressed, but it's painfully obvious Newton isn't coming back.\n\"I told our guys before the game it was this time last year that we made the switch at halftime of the Vanderbilt game, found a little combination, played well and ran with it from there on out and finished strong,\" Hunt said. \"But we just didn't play very well. So we're behind where we were last year, put it that way.\"\nHeading to Tennessee today, needing a win to stay in the SEC East championship race, the Gamecocks have shuttled linemen in and out of practice trying to find the right mix. Web Brown at center and Meredith and Sorensen at the tackles seem entrenched but the two guard spots could be helmed by Seaver Brown, Lemuel Jeanpierre, James Thompson or Kevin Young.\nEven Heath Batchelor, who's only played in one game (S.C. State), could start at right guard, as Spurrier indicated in practice this week.\nBut if it doesn't work -- again -- where do the Gamecocks turn? Hutch Eckerson, Quintin Richardson and Kyle Nunn are redshirting this year along with Pierre Andrews, who's already redshirted but is using this season to add weight and muscle.\nThat leaves Garrett Anderson (a three-game starter at left guard but a backup in recent weeks), Gurminder Thind (a backup who's been fighting a sprained ankle all year) and"}

The company also opened 230 new stores across 48 markets.\nHis jaw-dropping wealth could easily have made Ortega a media magnet, but he's craftily avoided the spotlight his entire life. A primary-school dropout born to a poor family, Ortega was a complete mystery before a photo of him was released publicly for the first time in 1999 in advance of Inditex's initial public offering. Fiercely private and press averse, Ortega reportedly paid off a paparazzi in 2012 to prevent photos of his daughter Marta on her honeymoon from being released, according to Wealth-X.\nOrtega also lives humbly, routinely eating lunch with his employees in the company cafeteria and sticking to a simple uniform of a white shirt and blue blazer.\nThe self-made fashion magnate is one of eight European billionaires that rank among the 50 richest people on earth."}

A newly passed interim policy allowed food trucks, for the first time, to operate weekly at approved locations outside of the Fruitvale district, as long as they were clustered into permit-carrying \"pods\" of three or more trucks.\nIt was easy to imagine that dozens of these so-called \"food pods\" would spring up all over Oakland \u2014 the first shots fired in a bloodless revolution of gourmet cupcakes and Asian-fusion tacos. People would come out in droves, and, buoyed by that success, city officials would quickly move to make mobile food \u2014 beyond taco trucks in Fruitvale \u2014 a permanent fixture in Oakland's culinary landscape.\nBut the fact of the matter is that Oakland's food pod experiment saw only minor successes in 2012. Citywide, just seven group-vending locations were established. And two of the pods (the Thursday night pod in front of Splash Pad Park and the Tuesday lunchtime Clay Pod, at the intersection of Clay and 14th streets) closed down earlier than planned \u2014 despite the fact that the City of Oakland recently extended its one-year pilot program, allowing existing food pods to continue running at least through July 1, 2013. According to the organizers of those two pods, there was never enough business to justify the ongoing expense of weekly permitting fees.\nMeanwhile, city officials don't appear to be much closer to reaching an agreement on a permanent mobile food policy that would ensure that food trucks would be able to operate in Oakland beyond July.\n\"Here it is a year later, and we don't even have anything to present to [city] council for a permanent policy,\" said Karen Hester, the organizer of the Bites Off Broadway food pod, which is closed for the winter months. \"It just seems like foot dragging, in my opinion.\"\nGail Lillian, owner of the LIBA Falafel food truck and organizer of the now-defunct Clay Pod, stressed that city administrators have been nothing if not supportive. But she, too, has been frustrated that Oakland hasn't moved more quickly on the legislation front.\n\"It was hard to run a pod this year thinking it was just going to end in January,\" Lillian said.\nFor their part, city officials note that Oakland simply doesn't have the resources to make mobile food vending one of its highest priorities. Alisa Shen, the city planner who has taken the lead role on mobile food, has a host of other major projects she's coordinating \u2014 she's only able to work on the mobile food policy when she happens to have some free time.\nShort staffing aside, one of the biggest holdups has been the issue of enforcement. If the interim mobile food policy has failed, it's in large part because the city has lacked the wherewithal, or the political willpower, to actively enforce that policy \u2014 that is, to discourage renegade trucks who flout the law and hawk their wares guerilla-style, part of no pod and having pulled no permit.\nAnd why should these solo operators trouble themselves to join a food pod when there's little consequence to breaking the law?

Most of us are law-abiding, and our privacy and security is too important to be eroded merely to make the Orwellian nonsense of Hawaii-Five-O into a reality.\nToday, someone pointed out to me the text of Bill C-52, currently under consideration by the Canadian federal parliament.\nAmongst the many proposals in this Bill are two specific clauses to reduce the \u2018due process\u2019 imposed upon Canadian law enforcers when they wish to acquire information about internet subscribers from Canadian ISPs.\nany information in the service provider's possession or control respecting the name, address, telephone number and electronic mail address of any subscriber to any of the service provider's telecommunications services and the Internet protocol (IP) address, mobile identification number, electronic serial number, local service provider identifier, international mobile equipment identity number, international mobile subscriber identity number and subscriber identity module card number that are associated with the subscriber's service and equipment.\nThe first sort of investigator authorised to acquire this information merely by asking (actually, the second listed in the Bill, as it is a special exception to the main proposal) is, broadly speaking, any police officer.\n(c) the information directly concerns either the person who would perform the act that is likely to cause the harm or is the victim, or intended victim, of the harm.\nYou can probably quickly think up a number of scenarios in which this regulation might be a lifesaver. And the Bill requires any police officer who takes advantage of these special powers to declare that he has done so to a superior, who is, in turn, required to re-confirm the request with the service provider. So there is at least some bilateral oversight involved.\nOf greater interest to privacy advocates, however, is the proposal in the Bill that each law enforcement agency would be able to designate up to five percent of its staff to request precisely the same information pretty much at will, about any subscriber.\nThis makes \u2018fishing expeditions\u2019 possible. The Bill doesn\u2019t appear to place any limit, other than perhaps common sense, on the number of subscribers whose data can be sucked from an ISP at any time.\nThe Bill doesn\u2019t even seem to propose that the requests be based on any sort of specific identifier, such as a name or an email address.\nThis suggests, in the worst case, that an ISP might be compelled simply to hand over information about all subscribers. No warrant needed, and thus no proactive oversight by the judiciary.\nI\u2019ll leave it to the Canadian legislature to debate whether this is really a change which Canada needs; to Canadian privacy advocates to argue the pros and cons as visibly as they can (I\u2019m OK with legal street protests, but no Anonymous-style \u2018hacking\u2019, please!); and to the voters to make amends next time if the Bill passes but is deemed a step too far.\nMy concerns go beyond just those about our right to be free, as far as possible, from surveillance and intrusion by law enforcement. I\u2019m just as worried about the safety of having information about our internet identities routinely duplicated into multiple databases.\nIf you are Canadian, I urge you to oppose Bill"}

But it remained \"extremely dangerous\" and was forecast to bring \"life-threatening storm surge, wind and rainfall\" to parts of west-central and southwestern Mexico ahead of an expected Tuesday landfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\nHotel workers started taping up windows, and officials began evacuating people and shuttered schools in a low-lying landscape where towns sit amid farmland tucked between the sea and lagoons.

Multiple reports have sources explaining (anonymously) that the tech behemoth has hundreds of employees working on a now-not-so-top-secret project to innovate and develop an electric vehicle. If this comes to fruition by as early as 2020, as sources have indicated, it would be a game-changer for not only the world of technology, but the automotive and transportation industries as a whole.\nIn the 1980s, Apple took on a similar development project, which branched the company away from its core product offering. The team developed the Newton, a PDA that was the first of its kind, even coining the phrase \"personal digital assistant\" to describe it. But beyond coming up with the name for a category that would come to life for a whole host of competitors soon afterward, the product flopped. Former Apple CEO John Sculley has estimated it took roughly $100 million to develop the product, only to see it completely fail. Apple had entered a new space in the late '80s and didn't get it right--and now in 2015 in nor-Cal, they're setting themselves up for failure once again. To avoid another Newton moment, Apple must build and launch this car in Detroit.\n1) The right talent and know-how. Here in Detroit, we have the most talent, expertise, and focus on cars. If you want to make a blockbuster film, Hollywood is your place. But a brand new car--we have all the right resources, from talent to suppliers to 100 years of know-how. I mean, let's be clear: We didn't earn the nickname \"Motor City\" for nothing.\n2) The right experience and mindset. We have a rich history, but a fresh approach. This Rust Belt city is in the midst of massive transformation, and we are no longer tied down by the failures of the past. After hitting bottom around 2008, then coming through on the other side of municipal bankruptcy, Detroit (and the auto industry as a whole) is crafting the most prolific rebirth in American history. So we offer the perfect balance of experience combined with open-mindedness.\n3) The right leaders. Our governor is a former startup entrepreneur turned venture capitalist. Our mayor is a powerful and successful business leader. The leadership in the Big Three has never been stronger or more innovation-driven than it is today. We have the right leadership in both the public and private sectors to cut through BS and bring this vision to life.\n4) The right location. Detroit is centrally located in the country, and due to the auto industry's stronghold here, there's easy access to parts, labor, and suppliers--both domestically and internationally, just across the Canadian border. Additionally, the city boasts a close proximity to University of Michigan, CCS, and others for top engineering and design talent.\n5) The right cost structure. Building cars is very different than building iPhones. According to General Motors former vice chairman Bob Lutz, in a good year, you'll see 5 percent to 6 percent profits. In a bad year, you hemorrhage cash. With thinner margins, Apple must manage its cost structure to win in the automotive sector.

Logging and salmon fishing provided most of the jobs. Then, the logging industry depleted most of its inventory. Saw mills closed. And now the salmon beds are covered with silt. Today, the residents count on marijuana for their economy.\nLocal economists estimate pot contributes more than $500 million to the county's $3.6 billion economy. And those dollars don't come just from selling pot, but from jobs supporting and processing it.\nDawn Walker, for example, works as a trimmer, carefully separating the potent buds from the leaves.\nA lot of people support their families. A lot of specifically women support their children doing this job. And it's \u2014 it's something that almost everybody participates in.\nIt can take more than eight hours to trim a pound of marijuana. But it pays well, between $20 and $25 an hour.

He said two were killed by hotel guards at the beginning of the attack and four others either blew themselves up or were killed in the airstrike or by Afghan security forces.\nA NATO spokesman said that the international forces tracked the situation through the night but left the fighting to the Afghans until early today when the International Security Assistance Force was called in.\n\"Two ISAF helicopters circled the roof of the hotel and then identified three individuals believed to be insurgents on the roof, and the helicopters engaged the individuals with small arms,\" NATO spokesman Maj.

It said the monies sent out of the country were equity dividends.\nSources have told Reuters that the scale of the central bank\u2019s demand affects market conditions, casting into doubt the likelihood that the listing process would be completed by the end of the year, if at all.\nShares in MTN fell nearly a third in Johannesburg in the days after the central bank issued its demand on Aug 29. Mupita said the shares were oversold and trading below broker consensus. MTN\u2019s shares were down 2.78 percent at 1800 GMT on Wednesday.\nMupita said MTN was committed to Nigeria and would stay in the country, adding that the company was looking forward to an amicable resolution to the matters. Nigeria is MTN\u2019s biggest market, accounting for a third of its annual core profit.\nSome political analysts see politics as a factor in the pressure on MTN, as Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in 2015 on promises to push through tougher regulation, is seeking re-election in 2019.\nMupita said the listing was part of the conditions it had committed to meeting as part of the settlement of the previous fine. He said the company saw no connection between its present challenges in Nigeria and that fine.\nMTN was working with local and foreign advisers on how to carry out the listing, Mupita said.\nIn response to the tax demand, MTN filed a lawsuit in Nigeria on Monday against the country\u2019s attorney general aimed at protecting its assets.

Both parties hope a victory in Sicily will give them momentum heading into the national race early next year.\nBallots were not set to be counted until Monday morning.\nA victory by Musumeci would restore the island&apos;s traditional political order after four years of a center-left administration. On the other hand, a victory by the 5-Star movement would hand the populist party control of its first region, a complicated one with lagging economic growth, high youth unemployment and an embedded Mafia culture.\nThe Sicily vote has turned into a proxy of sorts for national politics. All the major national party leaders, including former Premier Silvio Berlusconi for the center-right, 5-Star Movement founder Beppe Grillo and Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi, converged on the island in recent weeks to stump for their candidates.\nMusumeci, a former Catania provincial president, has been backed by Berlusconi&apos;s Forza Italia, the anti-EU Northern League and the right-wing Fratelli d&apos;Italia, as the center-right seeks to regain control over the island it governed for most of the last two decades.\nIt remains unclear, however, to what extent a center-right victory in Sicily would consolidate the alliance on a national level, where Berlusconi and Northern League leader Matteo Salvini are locked in a battle for dominance.\n\"Although the center-right is running united, the party leaders haven&apos;t campaigned together and the key question of the leadership of the alliance remain unresolved,\" said political analyst Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence consultancy.\nThe 5-Star Movement has made clear it won&apos;t enter a coalition with any other party, weakening its chances of running a majority government even if it is the largest vote-getter.\n\"That would make things even more complicated,\" said Giovanni Orsina of Rome&apos;s LUISS University, noting that 5-Star mayors in both Rome and Turin were facing political difficulties. \"Imagine adding to that another complicated situation.

{"idx": "35729", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Natalie Choate details how tax reform has impacted retirement benefits, especially Roth conversions.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) makes sweeping changes to the tax code, but only a few directly impacting retirement benefits. The biggest change is the elimination of the ability to undo a Roth conversion. Minor changes include an extended rollover deadline for some plan loan distributions, comments blessing \"back-door Roth contributions,\" special deals for \"qualified 2016 disaster distributions,\" elimination of the ability to deduct IRA losses or the payback of small plan overpayments, and an indirect boost to qualified charitable distributions.\nAlso interesting is what is not included in the law. We still have the life expectancy \"stretch\" payout and the ability to use recharacterization to fix some IRA mistakes, and we still do not have lifetime RMDs for Roth IRAs.\nThe most significant change TCJA makes regarding retirement benefits is the elimination of the right to undo, or recharacterize, a Roth IRA conversion.\nSince 1998, individuals have had the right to convert all or part of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, at the cost of paying income tax currently on the converted amount. There have been lots of changes over the years since 1998: For conversions in some years, the taxable income from a conversion could be spread over several taxable years. Prior to 2010, only individuals with modified adjusted gross income under $100,000 were permitted to convert; now there is no income limitation. For some years, only traditional IRAs could be converted to Roth IRAs; now, a distribution from almost any traditional retirement plan can be transferred (converted) to a Roth IRA. At one time, Roth IRAs were the only possible destination for conversion contributions; in recent years, in-plan conversions (transfer from a traditional plan account to a designated Roth account in the same 401(k) plan) have been allowed (if permitted by the plan).\nThroughout the 20-year existence of Roth IRAs, the Roth IRA converter has had a unique privilege: The option to change his or her mind and reverse the conversion, until the extended due date of his or her tax return for the conversion year.\nNote that the option to recharacterize a Roth conversion applied only to conversions to Roth IRAs -- \"in-plan conversions\" have never been reversible.\nThe TCJA eliminates the right to undo a Roth IRA conversion. For Roth IRA conversions in 2018 and later, there will be no option to recharacterize the conversion; all Roth conversions will be irrevocable.\nWhat's not clear yet is how the TCJA impacts 2017 conversions. Under pre-TCJA law, the 2017 conversion of a traditional plan or IRA to a Roth IRA would have been reversible until Oct. 15, 2018 (assuming the individual timely filed his or her 2017 income tax return). The provision of TCJA disallowing recharacterization for a Roth IRA conversion contribution \"shall apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017.\" Some practitioners read this to mean that the ban applies to Roth conversions that occur after 2017, meaning that conversions that occurred in tax year 2017 can still be reversed until the Oct. 15, 2018 deadline. Other practitioners read the law as simply banning,"}

That's more than three times the rate of health troubles faced by individuals in households making more than $47,700 a year, where only 12 percent of people reported being in poor to fair health, according to the findings published in Health Affairs.\nWhile wealthy people around the world generally have better health outcomes than their fellow low-income citizens, the gap in the United States was among the world's largest. Of the 32 rich and middle-income countries studied, only Chile and Portugal had a wider gulf.\nThe timing of the study is important \u2014 it was conducted just before many of the Affordable Care Act's major policies were enacted. A major facet of the ACA was a redistribution of income, a tax on the richest Americans that helped pay to expand health coverage for the country\u2019s poorest, and the study's authors said it suggests that any reduction in coverage could be a step backward, in an area where the United States has been underperforming.\nNow the policies that expanded health coverage are on the chopping block. A recent Congressional Budget Office analysis found that the latest version of House Republicans' proposal to replace the ACA would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured than under current law by 2026. Senate Republicans are crafting their own health-care bill.\n\u201cAnything, any changes that are made that threaten to undo gains in insurance that have occurred since the Affordable Care Act . . . would risk setting us back in an area where the U.S. is in sore need of improvements,\u201d said Joachim Hero, who recently earned his doctorate in health policy at Harvard University and led the study.\nBut he and his co-authors caution that there's more to closing the health outcome gap than providing insurance. When the researchers tried to do more of an apples-to-apples comparison by adjusting for whether people had insurance or not when making the cross-country comparison, they found that the disparity was only slightly decreased.\nHero's work found that the disparity between richer and poorer people was not just in their self-reported health; the United States also ranked near the top in the income-based disparity between people who went without needed care because they couldn't afford it. In the Philippines, the gap between the rich and poor skipping care because of cost was the greatest. But the United States was second on the list; 1 in every 5 people in the bottom third of income reported skipping medical treatment because of the cost. In the top third, only 1 in every 25 Americans did.\nOne of the most surprising things to the researchers was how aware people in the United States were of the lack of access to health care in the country. Two-thirds of respondents in the United States said that there were \u201cmany\u201d Americans who do not have the access they need \u2014 considerably more than the country next on the list, Poland. At the same time, the United States was on the lower end of the rankings when it came to a question about whether it was \u201csomewhat unfair\u201d or \u201cvery unfair\u201d that wealthier people can afford better health care, with only 54 percent of people saying it was not fair for rich people to get better health care.\n\u201cThe combination of those two things raises this question: Is there a lack of"}

The business manufactured custom HVAC duct systems for the commercial market and sold to mechanical and sheet metal contractors throughout Southeast Michigan.\n\"We were competing for whatever limited market there was in southern Michigan,\" said James Miller, managing partner. \"The necessity of innovation was brought about by the tension and pressure of the recession.\"\nWhile the economy continued to weaken in 2008, new construction projects declined. Miller said the company was losing business, so the partners began to look for other opportunities.\nThat year, the owners invested in building information modeling \u2014 engineered construction models which allowed customers to view a three-dimensional graphic of a proposed project. Miller said the models allow customers to spot potentially costly issues that can arise before the construction process, and allow different trade groups to come together on projects.\nHowever, Miller said many customers were unfamiliar with the new technology, so the company stopped selling the service.\n\"That approach didn't really bring us the growth and the opportunity that we hoped,\" Miller said.\nTwo years later, after networking with others in the construction industry, the company learned about Flamebar BW11, a fire retardant coating material developed in the United Kingdom. The company that manufactures the product, Firespray International LTD in Essex, England, commanded 60 percent of market in the U.K., Miller said.\nConquest Firespray negotiated a master license agreement for the product in 2011 for the U.S. and Canadian market, and acquired the intellectual property rights two years later.\nThe business was attracted to the product because it was less costly than traditional fire-rated HVAC systems and took up less space and time to install. For instance, Miller said fire-rated HVAC systems are typically wrapped in 2-4 inches of installation or boxed in with fire-rated drywall, but Miller said the Flamebar coating is only about 1-2 millimeters thick.\nIt's also less costly to ship. Miller said a shipping trailer typically holds $6,000-$8,000 worth of standard sheet metal duct, as opposed to $40,000-$50,000 worth of Flamebar coated HVAC ductwork.\n\"Traditional HVAC ductwork is relatively inexpensive but takes up a lot of space, so it's very difficult to ship,\" Miller said. \"We're able to ship Flamebar coated systems long distance and cost effectively.\"\nConquest Firespray also provides code compliance training for building code officials, engineers, fire marshals and mechanical contractors. Miller said Conquest began the education after the company discovered most industry-standard horizontal HVAC fire-rated assemblies are not in compliance with International Building Code requirements.\nAs a result of the Flamebar coating, Miller said Conquest's revenue has grown significantly, and he expects revenue to double by next year. The company closed a deal this month with Los Angeles, CA-based private equity firm Pacific Growth Investors LLC, which Miller said will help grow the company on a national scale.\n\"We decided it was time to invest more deeply and more quickly to get the product across the United States and Canada,\" Miller said.\nConquest Firespray has secured many large"}

''We were trying to find truth and meaning in life,'' said Jack Kerouac.\nAn ''American Masters'' documentary by the filmmaker Chuck Workman has admirably captured these personalities, as well as their uninhibited willingness to push an idea or a metaphor or a sentence to the limit. ''The Source: The Story of the Beats and the Beat Generation,'' tonight at 9:30 on PBS, mesmerizes with its protean visual style and dynamic score (which includes Dizzy Gillespie, the Doors, and Philip Glass's riveting ''Metamorphosis,'' performed as a tribute to Ginsberg, before the poet's death in 1997). It is also moving and funny and smart.\nMr. Workman hypothesizes that the Beats were instrumental in breaking down cultural and political taboos, and that their influence lingers. Fair enough. Individual expression has become almost obligatory; Buddhism has been embraced by New Age thought; the poetry coffeehouse lives in the East Village and on the Internet. Ginsberg even appeared in a Gap ad. Still, the sections on the 60's and beyond are less energetic than those chronicling the early years, maybe because the iconoclasts had become respectable.\nA pulsing stream of images and ideas captures the deeply ambivalent character of the 1950's. The public face of the era was represented by satisfied conformity: Ozzie and Harriet, tract houses, drive-ins, television and President Eisenhower. But there was another world where everyone else lived: blacks, gays, potheads, Lenny Bruce and people who liked Charlie Parker and may even have been curious about John Cage.\nThe prospect of this alternate universe drew Jack Kerouac, a hunk football player, to New York from Lowell, Mass., in 1944 to become a writer. It brought William S. Burroughs, the product of a proper St. Louis family who would become an addict and an exile (after accidentally killing his wife during a drunken ''William Tell'' re-enactment). Ginsberg grew up nearby, in Paterson, N.J., but his outsider credentials were solid: gay and a poet.\nAs young men, they were giddily narcissistic but apparently unconcerned with celebrity (difficult, now, to imagine a group of writers in New York like that). Kerouac wrote 14 books before he was published. They kept busy writing, partying, talking, and filming themselves and each other. We are shown clips from ''Pull My Daisy,'' a movie written by Kerouac and starring his friends, a Beat curiosity.

What makes this discourse even more important is that these twin disparities have emerged in the wake of unprecedented expansion in a globalised market capitalism that, otherwise, has lifted millions of people out of poverty across the globe over the last three decades.\nIn Pakistan, too, winds of change in economic discourse are blowing with unmatched scope and unparalleled intensity. One can see a cultural shift in the debate over every facet of social and economic life. A strong message for meaningful change is ubiquitous though it has not yet resulted in any mechanisms that address the causes of inequality and give the disadvantaged and the vulnerable a say in policymaking.\nIn keeping with this general trend, Rich People, Poor Country offers yet another \u2018theoretical\u2019 contribution to literature being produced on the subject of income inequality. Hopefully, it will not just have bearings on the ongoing public debate but will also attract attention from policymakers.\nThe book is authored by Syed Shabbar Zaidi, a known and established name in public finance, accounting and other financial disciplines. A major argument that he makes is that \u201cdominant economic philosophies\u201d of the day were developed by the West after the Second World War in order to favour western economies over the rest of the world. These philosophies, according to Zaidi, have resulted in \u201cuniversal guidelines\u201d for fiscal policies that developing countries must follow in order to partake in the spoils of a Western-led economic system.\nThese guidelines, the author argues, have resulted in low corporate taxes, declining import duties and a smaller government role in running and regulating business, finance and economy in many countries including Pakistan. Coupled with protections offered by offshore tax heavens, these policies helped shift wealth from the East to the West. This, says Zaidi, has had a predictable outcome: less than one per cent people have come to own 80 per cent of global wealth.\nChina, the author explains, is the sole exception. It has emerged as the world\u2019s factory because its policies, in opposition to western theories, have been designed to protect its industry and domestic market from competition. But now that Chinese capital has crossed its national frontiers in search for markets worldwide, it is subjecting developing nations to the same western economic model it has shunned for itself. For instance, China\u2019s prescription to address the huge imbalance that it has in its favour in its trade with Pakistan is the same as suggested by the West: seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nWithin this economic framework, Zaidi points out, consecutive governments in Pakistan have adopted some seriously disastrous policies. He strongly criticises misguided measures that led to the deregulation of the economy and the creation of a \u201cfree for all\u201d foreign exchange regime in the post-1990 period. He is equally critical of the \u201cabuse\u201d of the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement that promoted smuggling at the expense of local manufacturers and added little to Pakistan\u2019s tax revenues."}

The signing of the wedding contract is also witnessed by four Muslim males, two each for the bride and groom.\nBut the marriage last Wednesday in the northern city of Lucknow was presided over by a woman and all the witnesses were female. The only man involved in the wedding was Ali.\nWomen's rights activists have greeted the marriage as a symbolic step forward for Muslim women, but the ceremony sparked a firestorm of criticism from conservative Islamic institutions, especially the Dar-ul-Uloom seminary in northern India.\nThe seminary is an intellectual hub for South Asian Muslims. Many of its theologians have publicly denounced terrorism but their work has nonetheless provided the intellectual underpinning for some of the most radical and violent Islamic movements in the region, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nAn official at Dar-ul-Uloom, Ahmad Khizar Shah Masudi, called the marriage a \"cruel joke on (Islamic) laws.\"\nAnother Muslim group, the Lucknow Idgah Committee, has said the marriage is invalid under Islamic law.\nHasan, the bride, works for Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Aandolan, or the Indian Muslim Women's Movement, a rights group that seeks a greater role for women in Indian Muslim society.\nHasan brushed off the criticism. \"I do not care. Islam says there cannot be anyone between Allah and his disciple. How come these clergymen are interfering in our matter?\" she said Thursday.\nIndia, a predominantly Hindu country with a sizable Muslim minority, allows marriage, divorce and inheritance matters to be determined by religious laws, and the couple's unorthodox ceremony was approved by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which sets the rules on Muslim religious matters.\nBut Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangimahali of the board said, \"I won't ask anyone to go for this kind of marriage.\"\nMuslim religious leaders have for decades closely guarded the powers accorded them under the so-called personal laws and have resisted any attempts to dilute their authority.\nBut a small group of liberal Muslims in India have made several attempts in recent years to challenge traditional male dominance within the religion.\nIn 2005, a group of Muslim women established the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board, saying that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board wasn't doing enough to protect women's rights.\nEarlier this year, the group's leader, Shaista Amber, led a group of women in prayer at a major mosque in Lucknow, breaking with tradition, which does not allow men and women to pray together."}

We\u2019ve been intimidated by banks when dealing with our money, with airlines when our flights are delayed by non-weather related issues, and when any service promised by a company isn\u2019t up to snuff.\nWelcome to the commercial revolution: a movement fueled by social media and new technology that can threaten or bolster a company\u2019s success. A behavioral shift has occurred that no longer lets companies wield power over customers; it\u2019s now the other way around. One way for companies to adapt to this change is to improve customer service \u2014 with services like Zendesk leading the charge \u2014 treating people not as transactions but as human beings.\nZendesk CEO Mikkel Svane thinks companies should focus on service relationships by going where their customers are: \u201cIf you don\u2019t reach them on channels where they communicate, you\u2019ll lose them.\u201d From email to social media, interactive voice response systems to bots, firms have many options to consider, and managing them all is no small feat. This is where Svane sees his company coming in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big complicated world out there,\u201d he said, explaining that while the very notion of customer service is obvious to consumers, for the enterprise it\u2019s a new experience. To solve a brand\u2019s woes, one needs to look beyond simply responding to individual problems and address the core issue \u2014 the overall customer experience. \u201cIf you don\u2019t start treating customers nicely, it affects your bottom line,\u201d Svane said matter-of-factly.\nThis notion has propelled Zendesk forward in its evolution to become the pipeline for all customer service interactions between companies and consumers. In its infancy, the service was billed as an online help desk, where you could submit a service ticket without having to pick up the phone or communicate using email. Over time, the company has expanded into other mediums, including tying itself into Facebook Messenger and, most recently, expanding its SMS offering with a native offering powered by Twilio (announced at the Relate conference last week).\nZendesk did offer some variation of SMS support previously, but that was through partnerships and integrations. Svane felt that the move to a more native integration was warranted now that there is more innovation in the space. \u201cWe tried to democratize the tech to make it easier, so you don\u2019t think about using it,\u201d he remarked.\nIn April, much of the talk around customer service centered around bots, thanks to Facebook\u2019s support for them within the Messenger Platform. While these robotic applications had been around for a while in WeChat, Line, Slack, and Telegram, Facebook\u2019s entry accelerated adoption by making bots available on one of the largest messaging services today.\nAnd while some may be moving forward with a bot strategy, others caution against the complete removal of human interaction. \u201cBrands are now realizing just how much value exceptional customer service has when it comes to building and maintaining customer loyalty.

With a weak poll lead, they give a united shudder at what David Cameron and George Osborne would do in a second term. So not a penny of uncosted spending was committed, and no calls of the wild beckoned the party back to the future. Instead, old-time music was played at yesterday\u2019s revivalist Progress meeting, where Tony Blair told the party not to deviate from 1997 and, refighting his old battles, he warned of dangers Labour knows all too well.\nAngela Eagle, the party chair who steered the forum, says that everyone knows \u201cwithout fiscal credibility we\u2019ll be smashed. We can\u2019t protect the people we care about by raging from the sidelines.\u201d Jon Cruddas sees \u201cone trap after another laid for us by this chancellor, his political tripwires set everywhere \u2013 but we\u2019ll tiptoe past them\u201d. Not just how to win, but what awaits after winning haunts them all.\nPaul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, spelled it out last week: less than half the cuts have yet been made to reach budget surplus. Osborne has taken his tax rises and capital cuts already, so the rest is all to be done in cuts in current spending, 35% for each non-protected department. Osborne\u2019s plans, mirrored by Labour, are for a state set at 38% of GDP by 2018. Yet with the numbers of over-65s rising by 20% between 2010 and 2020, an ever greater slab of spending is going to pensions and the NHS, squeezing everything else. There is some incredulity in Johnsons\u2019s voice as he intones these figures. Does anyone really think it\u2019s politically possible?\nBut that\u2019s not a choice Labour dares offer to voters. Already it lags badly on economic credibility, despite tying itself into the straitjacket of eliminating the deficit by the end of the parliament \u2013 just two years later than Osborne (though few think Osborne will hold to that date). Labour is still blamed for the crash, still labelled as a reckless spender and high taxer, so even a hint of spending still saps at its credibility. Despite a cap on social security and every pledge paid for, mistrust is still not neutralised.\nThe injustice of the hostile media Labour faces means its discipline must always be titanium-tight, if not twice so. No such scrutiny for the Tories. Where was the City\u2019s indignation when Osborne broke his deficit-reduction timetable? Labour is never cut the same slack. After 1997, despite a colossal victory, Labour felt obliged to stick painfully to the two-year spending freeze the Tories had fixed \u2013 despite Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, laughing from the"}
{"idx": "35762", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Did the New 'Captain Marvel' Trailer Show Us a Scene From the End of the Movie?\nThe first time I watched the new trailer for \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d it seemed like all sizzle and no steak \u2014 totally sick and generally awesome, but light on details. It made sense, considering the way Marvel likes to keep important details under wraps. They\u2019d naturally want to save the good plot stuff for the movie itself and not give it all away like some other studios tend to do.\nBut after a couple more viewings things, I realized that actually it\u2019s full of little details that could be telling us a lot about what\u2019s in store. And one of these details involves a dialogue exchange that feels very much like something that would take place late in the movie. Maybe even immediately before the climactic fight.\nIt\u2019s not immediately obvious that the exchange in question even is one, because it involves one bit of dialogue from early in the trailer and another bit that comes far later. The first part comes right after the Marvel logo, when Annette Bening\u2019s unnamed character is telling Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) about her backstory.\nIt\u2019s actually a weird line even in the context of the trailer \u2014 other dialogue indicates that for at least a while Carol is going to think she\u2019s just a Kree alien, and not a human from Earth. So that line above feels like it\u2019s part of a late stage conversations on those grounds alone. But something Captain Marvel herself says near the end of the trailer reinforces that idea.\nBefore connecting those two lines to each other I remarked to one of my colleagues here at TheWrap that Carol\u2019s comment felt like a defiant response to the main villain, who would be somebody who has been manipulating her. And then I noticed that we get a brief glimpse at the scenery when she\u2019s making that declaration.\nAnd here\u2019s Bening delivering the other line from the beginning of the trailer.\nThat\u2019s pretty obviously the same place, and with standard shot reverse shot dialogue framing.\nThe vibe from these first two trailers is that the structure of the movie will be something like: in the first act, Carol chases the Skrull Talos (Ben Mendolsohn) to Earth and discovers she has a history there; in the second act, she finds out what that history is; in the third act, she responds to that revelation.\nThis scene from the new trailer plays like Carol has found out she\u2019s human and is confronting the person who gave her those Kree superpowers/hid her past. Then, that person tries to spin the situation as being for Carol\u2019s benefit. And, finally, Carol defiantly declaring that she\u2019ll no longer be a puppet for the Kree Empire.\nSo if that\u2019s an accurate read on the general structure of the film and on this scene in particular, that would place it in the third act.\nSo while we congratulate ourselves for piecing these details together, we\u2019re still missing crucial pieces of what will matter in the story this movie presents. There\u2019s definitely some other hidden layer. Unfortunately, we still have to wait another three months to find out what that layer is.\nIt\u2019s also possible that this is an intentional misdirection inserted in such a way that it seems like they were thought you\u2019d never notice, but which they actually hoped you would notice so you wouldn\u2019t figure out the truth. Damn, Marvel, you got me paranoid.\nWhatever the answer ends up being, \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d is out March 8."}

While the rest of his family was discussing the day's activities at the dinner table, Crist had a million questions about his teams going through his mind.\nWhen was he going to watch film? What teams did he need to scout? How was he going to make his team better?\n\"I hate to admit it, but even during the day as a teacher, I'm thinking about the things I shouldn't be during the day,\" Crist said. \"I should have been thinking about other things other than the team I was coaching at the time.\"\nNow, he'll be able to concentrate on those other things a little more. Crist confirmed Thursday morning that, after 10 years, he has stepped down as the head girls soccer coach at Wilson Memorial.\n\"In my gut it just felt like the right time,\" said Crist, who also stepped down earlier this year as the boys basketball coach following a two-year run.\n\"With the VHSL rules they have now, you can pretty much practice year round,\" he said. \"You can do a lot of things nowadays that you couldn't do when I first started. It became more time consuming.\"\nCrist couldn't even remember the last time he wasn't coaching. Before taking over the Wilson girls soccer program, he was involved in coaching travel soccer. He also spent time as a boys and girls basketball assistant.\n\"I'm in a little bit of a weird place right now because I don't have a team,\" Crist said. \"I'm not coaching anything.\"\nHe thinks the soccer program is in a good place. The jayvee team was undefeated this spring and the varsity team reached the regional tournament before losing to powerhouse and eventual state champion George Mason.\nThat makes leaving the team a little easier. It also helped that Crist's youngest daughter, Madi, graduated from Wilson this year and will be headed off to college next year. As empty nesters, Crist and his wife, Penni, will be starting a new chapter in their lives. Coaching won't be part of that chapter.\nLast year this time, Crist said he was leading his team in the summer league and getting ready for summer camp at Emory & Henry.\nThis summer, he's not having to think about any of that. Not that it's easy.\n\"I should be doing something right now,\" he said. \"I should be putting together a practice plan. I should be putting together a training session. So it is a little different.\"\nWhen he took the basketball job, Crist was excited, but, looking back, he's not quite sure he was prepared for the time commitment. But it seems to Crist that is becoming more and more the case for all sports.\n\"I don't think people understand the amount of time coaches are away from home,\" he said. \"Riding that yellow school bus to Luray and Page and not getting home until 10:30, 11 o'clock at night. Practicing Saturday mornings. It just became, for me, too much of a time commitment.\"\nCrist made it clear this was a decision made by his family and him, not the Wilson administration.

In 2010, as anti-austerity strikes and Molotov-fueled street fights in Athens made international headlines, reservations dropped at the small eco-hotel he runs with his wife, Smaragda, in an olive-tree-dotted valley in northern Crete.\nThis year, though, the big protests are in North Africa and the Middle East, and the bookings at Achlada-Mourtzanakis Residence \u2014 as for most hotels in southern Europe \u2014 have rebounded. That\u2019s an especially happy development for Greece, Portugal and Spain, where tourism could revive struggling economies.\nAccording to a spokesperson for Thomas Cook UK & Ireland, the second-largest European tour operator, the revolution in Egypt diverted many tourists to Spain and Greece in the first three months of the year. Bookings to the Balearic Islands near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula increased by 30 percent compared to last year, while bookings to Greece went up 20 percent. And the trend appears to be holding through April, which has seen a 25 percent increase in bookings in Spain, especially the Canary Islands, the tour operator said.\nAndreas Andreadis, president of the Hellenic Hotel Federation, said he expects a 10 percent increase in tourism arrivals to Greece because of the unrest in North Africa. \u201cWe were already seeing an improvement from last year, but the events in North Africa sped things up,\u201d he said.\nBut a spokesperson for the United Nations World Tourism Organization said southern Europe should not expect this diversion in tourism to last long. Travelers are already returning to Egypt and Tunisia, and the the organization is still expecting international tourism in the Middle East to increase by at least 7 percent.\nSouthern Europe accounts for some 18 percent of international tourist arrivals and 19 percent of international tourism receipts, the organization said. Tourism makes up 11 percent of GDP in Spain and Portugal, and at least 16 percent of GDP in Greece, which has relied on a steady stream of income from millions of tourists, especially to marquee islands such as Santorini in the Cyclades, with its postcard views of whitewashed homes on black-rock cliffs around a deep-blue caldera.\nBut in recent years, European tourists seeking the sun-and-sea experience have gone to Tunisia or Egypt, where it\u2019s cheaper. American tourists, meanwhile, often choose the Caribbean or Hawaii for beach vacations and have traveled to southern Europe \u201cout of tradition,\u201d said Paul Cohen, president of Partner Concepts, a marketing firm in Annapolis, Md. \u201cFor Americans, European countries like Italy and Greece were where you went when you grew up and acquired wealth,\" he said.\nBut Cohen added that the high value of the euro, the currency used in the European Union, has made most European vacations expensive for Americans in the last few years. And in the last two years, Greece in particular has also struggled with a bad image.

Lawmakers backing the proposal, amid calls by some Democrats to \u201cabolish\u201d U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said they hoped a bed limit would force the agency to refocus its attention on violent criminals while backing off immigrants who lack legal status but have not committed serious offenses.\nBefore the deal scrapped the proposal, Trump administration officials had denounced the idea, saying a reduction in detention beds would hamstring ICE and force the release of thousands of criminals. Matthew Albence, ICE\u2019s deputy director, said he had never seen a proposal for such a cap during his 24-year career.\n\u201cIt would be extremely damaging to public safety,\u201d Albence said.\nBut the Democrats\u2019 maneuver was not entirely unprecedented: It takes a little-known funding mechanism long-wielded by border hawks and tries to turn it against them.\nProponents of a more-rigorous approach to immigration enforcement have for more than a decade treated detention bed funding as a way to ensure a minimum number of immigration arrests. By tying funding levels to a specific number of beds \u2014 40,500 per day last year \u2014 appropriators were able to establish an informal quota for enforcement activity. Unofficially known as the \u201cbed mandate,\u201d Republican lawmakers typically pushed for as many beds as possible and encouraged ICE officials to fill them with potential deportees.\nDespite a partial government shutdown that lasted nearly 35 days, President Trump\ufffd\u0080\u0099s efforts to secure border wall funding fizzled last month. However, that has not stopped efforts that were already underway to shore up sections of the southern border in two Texas counties.\nThe Democrats\u2019 proposal aimed to cap the number of detention beds available for interior enforcement at 16,500 per day. Democrats also wanted to reduce the overall number of available beds to 35,400, far below the 52,000 that the Trump administration has requested.\nPresident Barack Obama came under criticism during his first term from many Democrats and immigrant advocates when annual deportations reached levels that far exceed current totals. By his second term, ICE had developed a more tailored enforcement approach that targeted serious and violent offenders but gave greater latitude to immigrants who were otherwise law-abiding.\nAfter Trump took office, ICE officials praised him for \u201ctaking the shackles off\u201d and giving agents greater discretion to make arrests. Criminal violators remain the agency\u2019s priority, ICE officials say, but they also have sparked a backlash with arrests of immigrants with deep community ties, American children and well-established lives in the United States.\nICE arrests increased 11 percent last year, and the agency carried out 14 percent more deportations. But enforcement efforts have fallen far short of Trump\u2019s post-election promise to immediately remove 2 million to 3 million immigrants living in the United States illegally.\nAt a time when record numbers of Central American families have been showing up at the border, the number of people held in ICE custody has soared to"}

Both types are public schools.\nDistrict schools, however, get additional funding from local tax dollars via secondary property taxes, while charters use private dollars generated by the school's sponsoring body.\n\"You have primary and secondary tax rates. Every property, basically, except in rare situations, should have a primary tax assessment,\" Carter said.\nSecondary tax rates come into play when there are voter-approved bonds and overrides, he said.\nThere are currently 28 charters schools in Yavapai County. There are 25 kindergarten through grade 12 public school districts in the county. Carter's office operates the Yavapai County Education Service Agency (YCESA), which regulates elections, finances and more for schools in the county.\n\"We are not a regulatory agency. We're a fiscal agent. We do all of their elections. There are 162 things in statute that county school superintendents, or the ESA, has to do. Most of those are financial, but a lot of them are instructional as well,\" Carter said. \"We have zero jurisdiction of any kind over charter schools.\"\nWhen it comes to sports and extra-curricular activities, Carter cited \"significant differences.\"\n\"District schools tend to be more comprehensive.\nThey try to have as many academic programs, as many electives, as they can. They try to have as many activities as they can, especially those kids and parents say they want. They try to be all things to all people. Personnel, facilities and funding can limit those things,\" Carter said.\nCharter schools, he said, stay closer to the edicts set forth in their charters.\n\"Their focus is different. If their charter says they're going to be an equestrian-based program, then basically everything they do should be focused around some equestrian aspect. Some charters do have athletic programs,\" Carter said.\nCharter schools are typically created by community organizations, parents and teachers, and for-profit organizations. It is rare for a charter school to be affiliated with a school district, Carter said.\nLike district schools, charter schools also use boards, which are selected based on the school's charter document, and normally serve in an advisory capacity.\nDistrict school governing boards are based on state statutes and required to perform certain functions, such as submitting an annual budget.\n\"They are a political subdivision of the state of Arizona. They only have the power that the state of Arizona gives them,\" Carter said.\nCharter schools, he added, have to follow their charter first. The role of a charter board, he said, can vary.\n\"There has to be a governance structure named and approved in the charter,\" Carter said. \"None of them are elected boards like districts have. In some cases, the director can almost serve as a one-person board. In some cases, it's the executive officers of whoever holds the charter, which might be four or five people.\"\nSome charter boards, he added, can also make all the decisions for the charter school.\n\"In some cases, the charter operator is the charter holder, which means they have an advisory board.

Naturally, this sent the US ethanol industry into a fit; under many analyses corn ethanol wouldn't fare too well. Now, the ethanol lobby has managed to do on the Federal level what they couldn't in California, convince Congress to put industry interests ahead of the environment. The details coming out from a couple different sources aren't entirely clear, but this is what we know:First of all, it's important to note that no one outside of Congress has seen the actual language of the compromise, but Biofuels Digest reports that the deal was cut between House Agricultural Committee chair Collin Peterson (D-MN) and Commerce Committee chair Henry Waxman.\nThe EPA \"will not be able to use an international indirect land use change when it estimates the carbon footprint of ethanol and biodiesel\" for \"at least six years.\" Furthermore, this provision will be removed from the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act; and the National Academy of Science will review the science that indicates a connection between biofuel mandates being linked with deforestation in the Amazon.\nFarmers who have already made changes to production to limit emissions from soil, such as no-till cultivation, would receive carbon credits retroactively to include efforts going back to 2001. These farmers would be allowed to participate in the new program.\nThe Sierra Club came out saying the details they had seen seem to be \"undermining the scientific process and review at this point is unfortunate.\"\nThe League of Conservation Voters said that the compromise \"doesn't seem like a positive change.\"\nHowever, Joe Romm pointed out that though \"as a matter of science the deal is not optimal,\" the end effect of this compromise is slight, noting that most of the corn ethanol produced under the 2007 energy bill was already grandfathered in and would not have to meet these emissions requirements.\nUnder the 2007 bill, some 15 billions of corn ethanol were mandated to be produced per year.\nSo, if Romm is right (as he tends to be...) and the practical effects of this compromise are minimal, why should we pay attention: Because the corn ethanol industry (and corn growers more broadly) in the United States has simply already gotten too many handouts and concessions.\nFirst generation biofuels are simply a dead end when it comes to replacing large amounts of fossil fuels and we need to be focusing on other renewable energy sources (including appropriate use of second generation fuels, where applicable).

But he couldn\u2019t quell disputes among his colleagues over several contentious amendments that were blocked from votes and failed to be added to the bill.\nAmong them was a proposal by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have protected transgender service members from being kicked out of the armed forces. Gillibrand and McCain seek to achieve the same goal through separate legislation they introduced late last week. That bill also is supported by Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services panel.\nApproved by the Armed Services Committee by a 27-0 vote in late June, the overall Senate bill provides $640 billion for core Pentagon operations, such as buying weapons and paying troops, and another $60 billion for wartime missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Trump\u2019s budget request sought $603 billion for basic functions and $65 billion for overseas missions.\nWith North Korea\u2019s nuclear program a growing threat to the U.S. and its allies, the bill includes $8.5 billion to strengthen U.S. missile and defense systems. That\u2019s $630 million more than the Trump administration sought for those programs, according to a committee analysis.\nNorth Korea last week conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile, firing an intermediate-range weapon over U.S. ally Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean.

If Apple isn\u2019t interested in producing a hybrid, there must be a reason behind it.\n[Photo by Stephen Lam / Getty Images]Cook went on to articulate the reason for the company\u2019s reluctance to build such a device.\nWhile Apple may think creating a hybrid laptop tablet device would produce a lacking device, that hasn\u2019t stopped others from trying.\nOther companies like Lenovo, HP, and ASUS have marketed \u201c2-in-one\u201d computers that are hybrids of a laptop and a tablet. The 2-in-one devices have yet to really captivate consumers.\nCook bashed the Surface Book, calling it a \u201cdiluted\u201d device. He said that it\u2019s trying to be a tablet and a notebook but excels at neither. As the Verge noted, Cook has been critical of two-in-ones for sometime. In 2012, he mocked two-in-ones, comparing them to a toaster and a refrigerator being combined.\nIt is worth noting that iPads have long supported bluetooth-enabled keyboards. This feature makes the iPad more like a laptop, but with all the limitations that come with an iOS device.\nMost Apple fans likely have no desire to see a two-in-one Apple device.\nIn the interview, Cook was also asked about Apple\u2019s future in the auto industry. There have been reports since September that Apple is working on their own electric car. The plans have yet to be confirmed and when asked about it, Cook declined to comment on any possible plans for an Apple electric car.\n[Photo by Joe Raedle / Getty Images]Elon Musk, the founder of the high-end electric car brand Tesla casted doubt on Apple\u2019s automobile aspirations. He said that building a car is much different from building a phone or smartwatch.\nHe also made fun of the fact that Apple has hired several former Tesla employees to help with their car project. Musk said he calls Apple the Tesla graveyard because the people his company fires go and work for Apple.\nMusk also said that he thinks it\u2019s a good thing that Apple is investing in the electric vehicle market. Elon Musk\u2019s critical take on the possibility of an electric car produced by Apple is anything but surprising.\nWith Apple in the ring as an electric car manufacturer, Tesla would have some serious competition that it previously hasn\u2019t had. It\u2019s not clear whether an Apple car would be high-end or not, but Apple will almost certainly have different tiers for its vehicles."}

International sales are being handled by L\u2019Agence du Court M\u00e9trage.\nThe film focuses on a 13-year-old girl, Ang\u00e9lique, and how she and the people around her react when she gets cast in a film. It\u2019s a story that closely mirrors the origins of the short itself. Her little brother is far more excited about it than she is, and can\u2019t stop discussing what life will be like when she is famous, and they can go to Paris for the film\u2019s premiere. Ang\u00e9lique plays it cool, however, as it\u2019s not in her nature to get overly-excited about anything other than the volatile dynamics of her social life.\nIn private it\u2019s another story. Ang\u00e9lique acclimates to the idea and finds herself growing more and more enthusiastic about the part, going as far as watching films and practicing her look in front of a mirror. Everything changes when she receives a phone call with some unwelcome news.\nThe film was shot using non-professional youth actors, and much of the script was taken directly from the stories and conversations shared between the filmmakers and the actors themselves.\nAkoka and Gueret discussed their short film with Variety, working with a young cast and trends they have seen in other shorts while competing around the world.\nYou really got the best out of some very young actors. Can you talk about the casting process (the real life one), and did it influence the story at all?\nGueret: We met each other while working at a casting for a large project where we were looking for young adolescents who did not have any prior film experience. We had never worked together before that, and did not aim to make this film at the time. \u201cChasse Royale\u201d is the product of the relationships and encounters that we made while at this casting.\nAkoka: Our first step was to write about the adolescents who touched us the most. The story in \u201cChasse Royale\u201d is similar to the experiences we had in our encounters. The reality of the situation therefore very much influenced our story.\nCan you talk about writing a story as it is experienced by a teenager?

The age \u201cgap\u201d was apparent and observing this moment where everything is changing, where personalities are built and refined, fascinates us and seems eminently poetic and cinematographic. The story and the dialogue are borne from improvisation sessions with the teenagers.\nRomane: We tried to write as close as possible to their words, and their expressions.

With today closing at 122.57, you can estimate that the odds of going bearish are higher they going bullish. When taking the lowest pivot of 101 as a base point and 134 as a limit point.\nIn order to arrive to this pivot points, I used many different indicators , We first start by using a 5 year chart of the spy, check the lows of middle of the \u201806 year and the top of the middle of the 2011 and you will see we are meeting major resistance at the 123 level( the level we are currently right now).\nNow using Transversal Wave theory, there is a 5 wave count from the 6 month chart and a head on shoulder\u2019s pattern with a neck line retesting the levels of 105.

With Copper Futures reaching major resistance, the Shanghai markets falling in the past few weeks and the European debt crisis looming our direction, it\u2019s very difficult to think positively in the equity market.

As he later relayed to NBC News, Niere, along with 12 other protesters, was arrested after cops told him and his friends that they \u201clooked like the type that were going to stir up drama and go start looting.\u201d According to Niere, police officers dragged him \u201cface-first on the ground\u201d and were \u201cstepping on the back of our heads.\u201d Niere and the others were held overnight and released.\nThis has been the pattern for more than a week: Dozens of legitimate protesters arrested for essentially doing it wrong, which can be variously described as protesting about issues of race, refusing to stop protesting about issues of race, and in many cases, perhaps most outrageously, protesting while black.\nYou might be asking yourself: Why do these things matter? Both protesters and counselors are assembling to express a message about which they feel strongly. That\u2019s cute. The critical thing about being a free speech protected \u201ccounselor\u201d instead of a less free speech-protected \u201cprotester,\u201d you see, is that the court recognizes that as a counselor, you have important information that you need to deliver to your audience and apparently some kind of magic inherent wisdom that your audience would benefit from hearing. A protester, on the other hand, can be pushed back from his desired location or corralled into a \u201cfree speech zone.\u201d Presumably this is because what protesters have to say is less urgent or informed. As described by Justice Samuel Alito in his McCullen concurrence, \u201ccounselors\u201d are even better read than the women they counsel.

Like McCullen, Epstein had an explicit political message to impart: She wants National Guard troops out of Ferguson and a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the killing of Michael Brown. It\u2019s hard to credit this message as less important, less informed or informative, or less urgent than McCullen\u2019s. And Epstein\u2019s crime, failing to disperse, is precisely the behavior granted First Amendment protection in McCullen.\nIt is impossible to see the two types of protest (or counseling) as fundamentally different, except for the fact that the court now says it does.

{"idx": "35807", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A win by this candidate could mean a wild swing higher, or lower, in gold prices.\nFollowing a multiyear downtrend, 2016 has been something of a rebirth for the gold market. Since the beginning of the year, gold's per-ounce price has risen by more than $260, or 25%, with gold turning in its best quarter in 30 years in Q1!\nWhat's been driving the lustrous yellow metal higher?\nFirst, the Federal Reserve's dovish monetary policy has been a big help. Perhaps gold's biggest influencer is opportunity cost, or the act of giving up a gain in one asset for the possibility of a greater gain in another. Because interest rates have been held near a record low for more than seven years, yields on bonds, bank CDs, and savings accounts have been minimal. In many instances, investors using these tools are losing purchasing power despite their nominal interest-based gains because the rate of inflation is higher. As long as the opportunity cost of buying gold, which has no yield, remains low, gold should do fairly well.\nSecond, supply and demand matter. According to the World Gold Council, gold demand during the first half of the year hit 2,335 tons, the second-highest first half on record, with 15% year-over-year growth in demand during the second quarter. ETF inflows and record first-half investment demand were credited for the surge in demand. Conversely, supply increased by just 1% during the first half of 2016, its slowest increase in eight years. These supply constraints, along with growing demand, have helped lift physical gold's per-ounce price.\nBut this last point brings up an interesting debate: Which candidate, Hillary Clinton of the Democratic Party or Donald Trump of the Republican Party, would be better for physical gold? Understanding that the answer is nothing more than speculation at this point, let's dive in.\nIn many respects, Clinton's policies would probably be pretty good for gold.\nAnother positive of a Clinton presidency is that (and again, this is an arguable point) U.S. GDP will probably pace right around or below the inflation rate. Many of Clinton's economic proposals echo or build upon the growth initiatives of the Obama administration, meaning that we probably shouldn't expect much in the way of major economic changes if she takes office. This also means the likely perpetuation of annual federal deficits, which tend to make gold investors pretty happy.\nIt's also plausible that Clinton's efforts to tax wealthier individuals in order to raise more federal revenue could be viewed with uncertainty. There's been an ongoing debate for more than three decades as to whether trickle-down economics works, and boosting tax rates on the rich may or may not wind up adversely affecting economic growth.\nIn all likelihood, I'd opine that a Clinton presidency would be a status quo-like event for physical gold.\nArguably the scariest factor for gold with a Trump presidency is what might happen with Janet Yellen and the Fed. Though Yellen's four-year term extends into February 2018, during his campaign Trump has been extremely critical of the Fed's actions of keeping interest rates near historic lows and has implied that interest rate hikes in the future could wind up letting the air out of the stock market in a big way. It's possible that if Trump is elected president Yellen won't stick around for the full length of her term.

It's gotten too dark,\" Mayor Jack Seiler said. \"As much as I think every one of us has been very involved in trying to protect the sea turtles, you can't do that at the expense of human life. You've got traffic, pedestrian issues, cycling issues.\"\nCommissioners said this week they'll consider relaxing the city's restrictions, not to light up the beach but to bring the regulations in line with less restrictive state recommendations for sea-turtle protection.\nThere's a tension between beach residents and turtle advocates.\n\"I think it's best just to keep our distance from the sources of this environmental lobby that embraces the love of baby turtles,\" said Fred Carlson of the Central Beach Alliance. \"I really embrace the lives of humans.\"\nThe approach in Broward is opposite to one being taken in Palm Beach County, where officials have been pushing for cities to extend lighting protections miles inland, especially at highly illuminated properties such as car dealerships and football stadiums.\nBaby turtles instinctively head toward the brightest light after they hatch. In nature that would be moonlight on the ocean, but man-made light can send them scurrying off in the wrong direction.\nFort Lauderdale's efforts may not be good enough for residents who feel their personal safety is taking a back seat to the interests of turtle advocates.\n\"We've gone way overboard with the sea turtle ordinance and regulation,\" beach resident Stephan Lange said. He has trouble finding his own home at night, he said, because of the lights-out conditions on State Road A1A near his neighborhood north of Sunrise Boulevard. He's also concerned the darkness is an invitation to more crime.\n\"We want to balance sea turtle life with human life, but not at the expense of human life,\" Lange said.\nOfficials hope to have relaxed lighting restrictions in place in time for next year's turtle-nesting season, which runs from March through October. The city plans to set up a beach meeting to see what other ideas residents have for revising the regulations.\nThe changes could be subtle. Current city rules don't allow light to fall on any part of the beach during turtle season, while the state says it's OK if light falls on the dunes closer to the road.\nCity staff is suggesting other changes that would allow for more street-level lighting, such as increasing dune vegetation that blocks the light from the view of turtles.\nThe city has installed turtle-friendly lighting on the east side of A1A south of Sunrise Boulevard, but Florida Power & Light Co. streetlights on the west side of A1A are not. FPL placed shields on those lights in 2008, but last year it was determined the shields weren't doing enough to keep baby turtles from becoming disoriented. Since then, the FPL lights have been turned off during the nesting season.\nSea Turtle Oversight Protection has documented thousands of hatchling disorientations in Broward County each year.\nOfficials eventually plan to have all lighting on the beach be turtle-friendly.\nThat concerns Lange, who doubts the lighting level will be sufficient.\n"}

At the far end of the room spotlights then direct us to an arc of scrunched up sheets of A1-sized white paper, stained grey-red and piled up almost indiscriminately, as though to resemble bodies waiting to be tossed into a mass grave. \u2018And They Still Seek the Traces of Blood\u2019, this paper installation is entitled; and the 15,000 scrunched up sheets contain the images of floor paintings Qureshi had made in Bradford in 2014 as part of the First World War centenary.\nNot only does the lighting carve up the gallery space, however: individual spotlights reach down within the fissures between the scrunched up sheets, searching out depths and textures, drawing out a play of shadow and shade. As the light pools in these gaps, it directs our focus not just to the designs just about discernable from the paper, but also to the void between them. It is apt for a work that comes out of a response to the deaths of the Great War to make its viewer so hyperattuned to spatial absence.\nIn these explosions, the paintings recall Whistler\u2019s nocturnes in black and gold, yet it is the dullness of the acrylic which, paradoxically, most absorbs its viewer.\nThe exhibition\u2019s lighting serves to attune us to depth\u2014not just within the installation, but also, and perhaps more strikingly, within the five paintings hung in the darkened middle of the room: the series See How the Dark of Night is Red from which the show as a whole takes its name. In these paintings, red acrylics blend greyed smudges and impastos with that same lotus leaf decorative pattern, upon which are superimposed explosions of white. In these explosions, the paintings recall Whistler\u2019s nocturnes in black and gold, yet it is the dullness of the acrylic which, paradoxically, most absorbs its viewer. The opacity of the finish, the interweaving of textures and patterns, deny us any single vantage point from which to get a view of the whole. The different angles and intensities of lighting then transform this from visual enigma into somatic experience: glints and smudges respond to different angles and depths of vision, so we shift our own angle and depth of view accordingly. We step backwards and sideways in the darkness until a motif hitherto invisible discloses itself; yet one further step and once again it recedes out of focus. We become awkwardly aware of our own bodies in this space, orienting ourselves continually in the dull light. In their play of light and depth, the paintings become as much an immersive experience as the installation.\nYet the most disturbing way these paintings enjoin our bodies is as the acrylic drips off the canvases on onto the floor: it is not so much that the paint has overspilled the canvas, than that the canvas now exists ostensibly as a surface for the paint to"}

So much mercury persists in surface reservoirs (soil, air, and water) from past pollution, going back thousands of years, that it will continue to persist in the ocean and accumulate in fish for decades to centuries, they report. \"It's easier said than done, but we're advocating for aggressive reductions, and sooner rather than later,\" says Helen Amos, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and lead author of the study, published in the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles.\nAmos is a member of the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), where researchers have been collecting historical data on mercury emissions as far back as 2000 BC and building new environmental models of mercury cycling that capture the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land.\nTheir model reveals that most of the mercury emitted to the environment ends up in the ocean within a few decades and remains there for centuries to millennia. These days, emissions are mainly from coal-fired power plants and artisanal gold mining. Thrown into the air, rained down onto lakes, absorbed into the soil, or carried by rivers, mercury eventually finds its way to the sea. In aquatic ecosystems, microbes convert it to methylmercury, the organic compound that accumulates in fish, finds its way to our dinner plates, and has been associated with neurological and cardiovascular damage.\nIt is generally assumed that mercury pollution began with the Industrial Revolution; in fact, humans have been releasing mercury into the environment for thousands of years. Past research has found it stored in peat in Europe and in layers of sediment at the bottoms of lakes in South America. The ancient Greeks and Chinese used mercury as a pigment; pots of quicksilver have been found in tombs dating to about 2000 BC; and the Assyrians are thought to have used both quicksilver and cinnabar (the bright red ore in which mercury naturally occurs) as early as 1900 BC. In 1570 AD, Spanish colonists in Central and South America were using it to extract silver; 300 years later, mercury again featured in the California gold rush.\nThe environment does naturally release and cycle a certain amount of mercury, blasting it out of rock with each volcanic eruption, but the new model developed at Harvard demonstrates that humans have been, and continue to be, responsible for the majority of the mercury currently found in the atmosphere, soil, and ocean.\n\"Ideally, mercury released by human activities would quickly be sequestered in the environment, but instead what we see is a huge quantity of it bouncing from one reservoir to the next,\" explains senior author Elsie M. Sunderland, who is the Mark & Catherine Winkler Assistant Professor of Aquatic Science at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate in environmental science and engineering at Harvard SEAS. \"This means it continues cycling throughout the environment and persists for much longer timescales than most people realize, which has implications for long-term biological exposures.\"\nThe new model quantifies the impact of historical emissions deduced from archaeological and anthropological research into artisanal and industrial techniques,"}

The winning bid came from a Los Angeles buyer who requested anonymity.\nThe mural shows a little girl holding a flower basket under the eye of a surveillance camera planted atop a tall stalk.\nThe seller of the mural was Eytan Rosenberg, a former gas station owner who allowed a group of three street artists to paint something on the business's white brick wall.\nRosenberg sold the gas station last year and painstakingly removed the artwork and installed it in a sturdy aluminum frame. He and his sister want to use the money from the sale to build a car wash.\nBanksy, who refuses to reveal his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England. He's known for his silhouetted figures and spray-painted messages.\nThe highest known price for a Banksy work is about $1.1 million for a mural called \"Slave Labor\" that was auctioned in London in June.\nBanksy's work has caught the eye of A-list Hollywood celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who recently bought a smaller piece for $1 million."}

Around the world, only Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, United Arab Emirates and Russia have the capacity to pump more.\nIn this scenario, we review what are the stocks to own in this time of commodity and geopolitical volatility. Below are our top choices.\nAccording to E&E News, India is not planning to buy any crude oil from Iran in November, raising the prospect that Tehran will lose another major customer as U.S. sanctions hit. Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. haven't asked for any Iranian cargoes for loading in November; and Nayara Energy also doesn't plan any purchases. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. hasn't made any nominations for that month. Final decisions on purchases aren't due until early October, so the refiners could still change their minds.\nPresident Trump has openly criticized China and Iran at the U.N. Security Council this week, accusing China of seeking to meddle in the 2018 midterm congressional elections, putting more fuel in the so-called \"Washington Premium\".\nThis environment is allowing even small companies to raise capital, like Rosehill Resources (ROSE) , tapping the equity markets to build cash war chests. ROSE announced this week a public offering for 6.15 million shares, or roughly $43 million. ROSE focuses on growing production and reserves in the core of the Delaware Basin. ROSE is one of those stocks that fall below the radar of institutional investors because it trades below $10/share and has only $300MM in market cap.\nAlso, it is fueling a spark in M&A and consolidation among U.S. producers. Even small energy services contractors like Key Energy Services (KEG) looked this week to merge with peer Basic Energy Services (BAS) on a stock-to-stock deal betting on the confidence in the industry recovery.\nOn the asset side, companies like WildHorse Resource (WRD) are stepping into buying additional acreage in the Eagle Ford shale to boost inventory. WRD is up 27% since mid-august after bottomed for the year, riding the crude oil rally. High oil prices have also allowed capital to be deployed into new basins, like the Merge Play in Oklahoma, where operators like Roan Resources (LNGG) , Jones Energy (JONE) , Cimarex Energy (XEC) and Marathon Oil (MRO) have been active.\nHowever, outlook is still not rosy everywhere as Permian crude oil differentials remain wide. The spread between Cushing and Midland delivery prices settled at $12.36/barrel yesterday or a $22/barrel discount from Brent. The differential has bounced from $18-$12/barrels since early May.\nAlso, Unipec, the trading unit of top Chinese refiner Sinopec, has put a plan to boost U.S. crude imports on hold as it assesses the impact of the Asian nation's trade war with America, according to company President Chen Bo.

The Fed would not actually set compensation, however, those people said.\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because the proposal has not been finalized.\nYet the proposal is far-reaching. The Fed would review salaries, bonuses and other compensation for CEOs and other senior management, the people with knowledge of the proposal said.\nIt also would cover certain employees, such as traders, who can take big risks on behalf of a firm, they said. And it would cover some workers whose compensation could affect their risk taking, such as loan officers making mortgages, they added.\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke\u2019s Fed could examine not only the compensation level but also how it\u2019s structured, such as when it is awarded, the sources said.\nThe goal is to make sure banks\u2019 pay policies don\u2019t encourage top managers or other employees to take gambles that could endanger a company, the broader financial system or the economy. The failure of many banks to closely monitor risk and limit compensation that might encourage too much risk contributed to the financial crisis.\nThe proposal, in the works since early this year, could be unveiled within weeks, people familiar with the initiative said. The public, the industry and others would be able to comment on the proposal, which could be revised. A final plan, subject to approval by the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, could be adopted by year\u2019s end.\nSome details of the Fed plan were reported earlier Friday by the Wall Street Journal.\nThe proposal would cover all banks - nearly 6,000 of them - regulated by the Fed. It wouldn\u2019t cover savings and loans or other institutions overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or other regulators.\nBecause compensation plans can be structured in numerous ways, the Fed is avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach. The biggest banks - about 25 of them - would develop their own plans to make sure compensation doesn\u2019t spur undue risk taking. If the Fed approves, the plan would be adopted and bank supervisors would monitor compliance, people familiar with the proposal said.\nAt smaller banks, where compensation is typically less, the Fed would provide guidance about what steps it thinks could rein in excessive risk taking.\nThe Fed\u2019s proposal is running on a track separate from the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to curb executive pay. The administration\u2019s pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, has been consulting with seven companies that received \u201cexceptional\u201d assistance from the taxpayer-funded $700 billion bailout pot.\nThose companies - American International Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., General Motors, GMAC, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial - last month had to propose compensation packages for their highest-paid employees. Mr. Feinberg has veto power over them.\nOnce those companies exit the government\u2019s bailout program, they would avoid Treasury oversight of their compensation. By contrast"}

Bush and the time he served as a casket guard during late President Gerald Ford\u2019s funeral.\nPresident Gerald Ford had passed.\nI remember that night in 2006 as if it were yesterday. I was not able to go home for Christmas that year. At least one-third of the command had to stay in the capital in preparation for the rare occurrence that we would need to participate in a presidential funeral, the reason the command had been specifically created. My parents and younger brother had arrived the previous afternoon, Christmas day, so I wouldn\u2019t be alone. We had managed to get a day and a half of sightseeing in before I would eventually call them and tell them our visit would be cut short. I would be on a C-17 bound for California by the time they would wake.\nI had been preparing for this moment for a year. Not just any sailor in the fleet could be called to participate in this ceremony. We spent hours each night ironing our uniforms with industrial pressers and even burned the strings from the inside and outside of our uniforms. We maintained the unique tradition of shining all the brass on our ceremonial uniforms until all the blemishes and holes were gone from the ceremonies we had performed that day at Arlington and/or the White House. We polished our ceremonial belts and medals, down to the heel brass on our shoes that would click together in perfect unison. Thousands of hours were spent marching and perfecting rifle movements with our leftover deadstock World War II-era M1 Garands with fixed bayonets. All this hard work and preparation would pay off.\nBy the time I landed in Palm Springs, Calif., I had been given my assignment. I was to be one of the Navy representatives guarding a corner of the former president\u2019s casket.\nAfter the memorial services at President Ford\u2019s personal place of worship, the St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church in Palm Springs, I quietly marched in with a representative of each of the other branches to silent calls from the officer in charge . We found our position at each corner of the casket as television cameras rolled and visitors passed through, paying their respects. It was imperative that we remained perfectly still for our half-hour shift. We would pick a spot in the room to focus on so our minds and bodies would tune everything else out. Four teams would rotate over the next 24 hours until we would leave for the next stop on our trip, the Gerald Ford Presidential Library in Grand Rapids, Mich., where President Ford would be laid to rest.\nOne of the most memorable moments I had during my period of service came after the casket bearers carried President Ford into the entrance of the library, where he would lay in repose until the funeral. During a commercial break, I was approached by members of the United States Secret Service to help assist in picking up the casket and moving it as the Lincoln catafalque \u2014 the stand upon which every president since Abraham Lincoln has lain in state prior to their burial \u2014 was adjusted.

Tulare has clean water that would replace the arsenic-laden water delivered by Matheny\u2019s aging water system.\nThe State Water Resources Control Board awarded $4.9 million in Proposition 84 funds to install the water main. The amount also will pay for water meters still to be installed.\nAt the time, it seemed that clean water would soon flow to the community of 300 homes and 1,200 people, where many speak only Spanish or trace their roots to the Dust Bowl.\nYet today, there is no clean water flowing in the new water main and many residents still are using bottled water for drinking and cooking.\nTulare refused to deliver the water, citing system capacity problems due to a well failure and legal issues involving jurisdiction outside city limits.\nAdvocates argued that the city must abide by a signed agreement to supply water and send the water bills to Matheny accounts no different than if they were inside city limits.\nWe want to deliver the water. We just want to agree on the terms.\nAt least one Tulare City Council member is siding with Matheny.\n\u201cI have been a supporter of that original agreement,\u201d said Council Member Carlton Jones, the city\u2019s vice mayor.\nJavier Medina, 48, worries people in his community will get cancer drinking water that contains arsenic.\nMedina, who has lived in Matheny Tract for 18 years, pays $35 a month for the dirty water, plus another $45 or so to buy bottled water for his family of six to cook and drink.\nMedina said hooking up the new water main from Tulare would be good for the whole community.\nThat\u2019s something that everyone should have \u2013 clean water.\nThe city sued both the Matheny Tract Committee and Pratt Mutual Water Co., which delivers the arsenic-laden water via an aging system. The lawsuit seeks to change the water delivery contract on grounds that the city lacks the legal authority to operate outside city limits.\nThe city said it wanted to wholesale water to Pratt and let Pratt bill the customers.\nThe case is set for trial next month; a mandatory settlement conference is Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, representatives of the State Water Resources Control Board held a public meeting Thursday evening at Palo Verde School.\nAt the hearing, residents said they want Tulare to stick with the original contract, Werner said.\nUnder a new state law, the board can require the city\u2019s water system to merge with Pratt Mutual\u2019s, she said.\n\u201cThey have been clear that they will require consolidation,\u201d Werner said.\nThe law went into effect last year and is so new that the board has yet to use it to require a merger.\nStaff writer Andrea Castillo contributed to this story."}

In all, over 235 different Royal Mail facilities including night offices, distribution centres and mail centres have stopped work, with most downing tools on at least two, if not three, separate occasions.\nThe rolling nature of the strikes has meant that between millions of letters and parcels are now piled up waiting to be delivered at mail centres and delivery offices around the country.\nOver the last ten weeks millions of cheques, worth hundreds of pounds to each consumer, have been delayed with a third of utility customers still refusing to pay their bills by direct debit and most small businesses very reliant on these postal payments.\nThe CWU has been able to create the effect of a national strike by balloting hundreds of individual area offices for local strike action. A key part has been to mobilise strikes in London, where yesterday 12,000 postal workers stayed away from work.\nConsumer groups are calling on banks and building societies not to levy fines or penalties on customers who fail to pay their bills on time if their payments are caught up in the postal backlog.\nTens of millions cheques could have been trapped within mail sorting offices in recent weeks, according to figures supplied by the UK Payments Association, which calculates that 63 million cheques are written each month, despite their decline in popularity. With very few shops still accepting cheques, the vast majority of these payments are sent through the post.\nWith the average cheque worth \u00a3226 for each consumer it is possible the value of the cheques stranded, or delayed, in the system totals tens of billions of pounds.\nThe postal watchdog Consumer Focus called on companies to be as sympathetic as possible.

A lack of sleep can lead to long-term health problems as well, which is going to have a negative impact on any business.

Just because someone is doing a lot of work, it may not be the work that they really should be doing. Multi-tasking can actually make work go slower, because people are just doing a bit of everything, and not all of one thing in as much time as they need to get it done right.

Another bonus to doing less is that people will feel less stressed about their work and be better able to accomplish things.\n5) You need to work yourself to death to be successful \u2013 Obviously, hard work gets the job done.

This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The first thing to do is figure out how to be productive, then measure the progress every step of the way.

Labour remain on 32% while the Liberal Democrats fall four points to 18%, their lowest rating in a Guardian poll since the summer.\nThe result underlines the big shift in public opinion that has taken place since Mr Cameron took over in December last year. Since then the Conservatives have averaged 37% in the Guardian/ICM series, four points ahead of Labour, which has averaged 33%. That is Labour's lowest annual average since 1992, the year that the Conservatives last won a general election.\nThe poll was carried out last weekend, after Tony Blair was questioned by police at Downing Street, and the party can draw comfort from the fact that its rating has remained unchanged.\nLabour's resilient performance confirms a trend suggesting support for the party has hit a bedrock of just over 30% and will not drop below that.\nMeanwhile Conservative support seems to have reached a maximum of 40%, almost certainly not enough to give Mr Cameron a majority at a general election. Although the result would leave him as leader of the largest party, Conservatives have yet to break through to an election-winning position.\nThe party will draw comfort, however, from the drop in Liberal Democrat support. Until now support for Sir Menzies Campbell's party has held firm despite Mr Cameron's attempts to appeal to the centre ground.\nUnderlying the shift in party support is the growing public belief that the Conservatives may be on course to win next time.\nOnly 12% of voters now think that the Conservatives will never win again, compared to 37% who think the party will win the next general election. When ICM last asked the question in July 2002, only 19% of voters thought the Tories would win next time.\nCrucially, Conservative voters are now enthusiastic about their party's chances, with 67% saying they believe that Mr Cameron is on course for victory. That may encourage them to turn out and vote. By contrast, 29% of Labour supporters think that their party will lose to the Conservatives.\nThe poll also shows that the Green party, and not rightwing groups such as the UK Independence party, poses the biggest threat to the main three parties.\nDespite recent publicity about Conservative defections to Ukip, and fears inside the party that Mr Cameron's remodelling of Conservative policy could alienate traditional support on the right, only 14% of Tory supporters say they might back Ukip instead.\nAsked to name one or more other parties that they might support, Conservatives are much more likely to choose the Liberal Democrats or the Greens: 32% of Tories say they might vote Lib Dem and 19% say Green.\nThe result appears to strengthen Mr Cameron's hand in arguing the Conservatives must embrace a radical environmental and social justice agenda.\nLabour supporters are also more likely to switch to the Lib Dems (30%) or Greens (16%) than Ukip (9%).\nNationally, Green support stands at 3% this month, against Ukip on 1%.\nAround a third of Tory and Labour supporters say they would not consider changing their vote.

{"idx": "35842", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Can Labour forge a new, 21st-century socialism?\nIn among all the noise about Brexit and Donald Trump, there\u2019s a remarkable sound: a great deal of the free-market, laissez-faire ideas that have dominated the last four decades being criticised and contested, perhaps as never before. In the US, the fallout from the election of 2016 has fed into the first stirrings of a new, confidently radical Democratic politics; in Britain, the Labour party might still be locked into endless travails and internal tensions, but it has definitely pulled politics leftwards. On a bad day, the political darkness can still feel overwhelming, but even in the most unlikely places, there are sometimes tantalising signs of light.\nA panicked Tory prime minister is now rhapsodising about public housing. The Economist last week published an essay about the revival of liberalism built around such ideas as land taxation and a guaranteed income. For sure, continuing austerity and the polarised state of politics may bring to mind the hoary old quote from the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci: \u201cThe crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d History doesn\u2019t glide; it wildly lurches. But the idea that neoliberalism is on the back foot is surely beyond doubt.\nWhat kind of capitalism we have, then, is now open to debate. But what cannot be argued with is the technology that sits under it, and the extent to which it defines how we live. Some people might think 2018\u2019s disruptions hold out the prospect of our economy and society somehow being rewound to the era before Margaret Thatcher \u2013 but in a world of working lives that endlessly change, information on tap and a public more assertive than ever, there is no going back. To use a term that evokes a lost time of deference, mass production, standardised everything and change handed down from the top, the post-1945 era was Fordist. This one is anything but.\nAs Labour meets this week in Liverpool, the need for left politics to finally adapt to these new conditions will intrude on the debates. At The World Transformed, the Momentum-led alternative conference that has enlivened proceedings since 2016, the blurb for one session baldly reminds its readers that \u201c1970s state socialism is dead\u201d, and there are fascinatingly energised sessions about reinventing politics from the ground up. By way of a nod to the same idea, the party has served notice that one of the big official themes will be the need to \u201cempower communities\u201d.\nThe problem is that these ideas have yet to be turned into the kind of stories and messages that might decisively push Labour somewhere new. The party has been transformed, but it has a split personality \u2013 to quote the academic Jeremy Gilbert, Labour continues to be divided between a \u201cdecentralised political movement that would like to build a more democratic and cooperative economy\u201d and \u201ca top-down project focused entirely on maintaining Corbyn\u2019s leadership, which is largely proposing a return to the statist social democracy of the postwar era\u201d. The former demands deep thought, and the willingness to surrender old orthodoxies; the latter is a comfort blanket to which much of the party still instinctively clings.\nThere will be a lot of talk in Liverpool about nationalising things, and much applause in response. The party\u2019s opponents will have no trouble claiming that its proposed cure for the grimness of the modern job market is a return to the labour relations of the 197"}

She primarily practices complex commercial litigation and intellectual property litigation and is a member of the firm\u2019s esports task force.\nVirtual reality may have found a game-changing partner: esports.\nRecently it was announced that Justice League VR: The Complete Experience is making its way from IMAX VR locations to PlayStation VR headsets, enabling video game users to step into the shoes of their favorite superheroes, such as Batman and Wonder Woman. The news comes on the heels of announcements that the publisher of the wildly popular video game Halo will team up with Microsoft to incorporate mixed reality headsets into the game and that Intel will create a competitive VR esports league with the help of ESL and Oculus.\nIt\u2019s clear that the days of esports being merely a spectator sport are numbered, as soon users won\u2019t just be sitting and watching the story unfold on a computer screen, they\u2019ll be immersed in it. What challenges will this immersion create when it comes to protecting one\u2019s intellectual property rights to the contents of a game and the innovative technologies involved, like VR? Undoubtedly, disputes over ownership of the underlying technology will increase as more players have a hand in the soon-to-be billion-dollar industry.\nOn the content side, developers will continue to seek protection of their copyright to the games and the underlying concepts regarding how the games are played. The Copyright Office has stated that copyright law does not protect the idea of a game by itself. Once a game has been made public, nothing in copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles. However, copyright law does protect the expression of ideas, the unique expression of the game\u2019s underlying concepts that make the character and content of the game.\nIf there is some copying, courts typically look to whether the allegedly infringing work is \u201cbased upon\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar to\u201d the original work. Generally, third parties are allowed to use the ideas contained in the game so long as they don\u2019t copy the expression of those ideas from the original work \u2014 such as the underlying software game code or those creative elements of the game that make up the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the copyrighted work. This will remain the case when the gaming industry incorporates VR, crafting a more complex gaming world for the user.\nThere\u2019s no doubt the game developer owns the content of the game, but as VR enables the user to interact with the content in a variety of ways, clear-cut ownership may get lost amidst the grey legal areas surrounding the virtual world. The question becomes where does the developer\u2019s right to the software providing the content end and where does the VR provider\u2019s right to the software empowering the user\u2019s experience with such content begin?\nThe legal dangers with this virtual gaming world will be largely rooted in the lack of clarity around intellectual property rights when content and technology come together to produce something new and valuable.\nOn the technology side, patents provide the owner with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell and importing patented inventions. Generally, there are two types of patents at issue in terms of VR: (1) \u201cutility\u201d patents protect the way a technology works and (2) \u201cdesign\u201d patents protect the way an article looks.\nBoth types of patents are at play when considering the functionality and processes of the game, game features and arena, as well as arcade center features.

{"idx": "35845", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Paperback not so much of the week as of the year, of the decade - or, I am inclined to say, of all time. And why? Because it's the best book ever written, that's why. I use the word \"book\" with care. It's not a novel, a tract, an epic poem, a history; it is, quite self-consciously, the book to end all books. Made out of all the books that existed in a 17th-century library, it was compiled in order to explain and account for all human emotion and thought. It is not restricted to melancholy, or, as we call it today, depression; but then a true study of it will have to be - if you have the learning and the stamina - about everything. That is why there are about 1,400 pages in this edition, why the only other edition, from Clarendon Press, runs to three volumes (it also costs a bomb compared to this and is, anyway, out of print), and why Burton never, strictly speaking, finished it: there was always something else to go in.\nFor it is not just Burton's thoughts on the subject of melancholy, but the thoughts of everyone who had ever thought about it, or about other things, whether that be goblins, beauty, the geography of America, digestion, the passions, drink, kissing, jealousy, or scholarship. Burton, you suspect, felt the miseries of scholars keenly. \"To say truth, 'tis the common fortune of most scholars to be servile and poor, to complain pitifully, and lay open their wants to their respective patrons... and... for hope of gain to lie, flatter, and with hyperbolical elogiums and commendations to magnify and extol an illiterate unworthy idiot for his excellent virtues, whom they should rather, as Machiavel observes, vilify and rail at downright for his most notorious villainies and vices.\" And that's a good quote to be getting on with: it shows you that Burton is on the side of the angels, that he's prepared to stick his neck out, and that he is funny.\nThis last point is important. The lazy browser won't even pick this book off a shelf, let alone open it. When opened at random, it offers not only dense slabs of 17th-century prose, but insane lists that seem to go on for ever, meandering digressions, whole chunks of italicised Latin. The slack browser who gets the gist of the introduction, \"Democritus to the Reader\" (Democritus was the laughing philosopher; another clue that this is a comedy), will realise that as far as Burton is concerned, everyone on earth is either stupid or mad (himself included). Say that you're taking this on holiday, as poor Alain de Botton did, and you get heaved straight into Pseuds' Corner.\nWhich is terribly unfair. The only reason you should not take it on holiday is because it will make your luggage too heavy. It is the ideal book to dip into, though. No one on earth is going to expect you to read it cover to cover. (Although I know one person who is doing just that.) It takes only a couple of minutes to get acclimatised to Burton's rhythms and phrasing. Once you do, you realise that he is a rollicking, more-ish writer, from an age that produced the nation's best prose. The Latin is all translated, apart from a bit about the"}

Without it, we would die: The human body can't make sodium, but our nerves and muscles don't work without it. It was considered rare until quite recently, so it's hardly surprising that, throughout history, salt has been the engine behind empires and revolutions. Today, there's a new battle in the salt wars, between those who think that we eat too much of it and it's killing us\u2014and those who think most of us are just fine. Join us for a serving of salt, seasoned with science, history, and a little politics.\nOne of salt's many mysteries is how our ancestors first figured out that they needed it: unlike hunger or thirst, someone suffering a sodium deficiency doesn't crave salt. What's more, until humans began farming, we had no need to add salt to our diets\u2014even today, Masai hunter-gatherers can get enough salt simply by drinking the blood of their livestock. But, however our need for salt was discovered, extracting it and trading it has shaped human history. From the very first brine wells in Sichuan province, China, to Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement, author Mark Kurlansky helps us trace the impact of salt through language, taxation, cuisine, and empire.\nAlthough salt was one of the world's most valuable commodities for millennia, modern geology, technology, and food processing has made it cheap and ubiquitous. Globally, we each eat an average of 3,500 milligrams of sodium a day\u2014a little more than a teaspoon and a half of salt. According to institutions such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and the American Heart Association, that's too much, and, if we want to avoid dying from cardiovascular disease, we need to reduce our consumption. But is that really true?\nAs the U.S. Food & Drug Administration prepares to issue new sodium reduction goals for food manufacturers, we dive into the contentious science of sodium to tease out what we do and don't know about the connection between salt consumption and health. It's a much more nuanced story than the constant refrain that we need to cut down would imply. So why is the U.S. government making policy if the scientific evidence isn't conclusive? In a special collaboration with the podcast DecodeDC, we untangle what the FDA is doing, and why\u2014and what that means to you, as a consumer. The draft guidance remains open for comment until August 31.\nFinally, we come full circle and explore salt's current culinary renaissance. From artisanal Icelandic lava salt to handmade hyper-local sea salt, we visit the enthusiasts who are restoring salt's lost status and value. Worried that you need to shake your salt habit?

There was no other sign of trauma, he told the Herald the following day.\nOn Saturday two small groups of journalists picked their way past the Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounding Tel Sultan to become the first to enter since the curfew was eased the day before.\nAt the Mughairs' three-storey house the children's older brother, Ali, 26, showed us the spot in the corner of the rooftop where, he said, Asma had been taking in laundry when a bullet blew the side of her head off. There was still a thick stain of blood and brain matter there.\nSmear marks showed where, he said, he had dragged her body towards the stairwell. In the stairwell another pool of blood and brains marked the spot where Ahmed was killed. According to his father, Mohammed, Ahmed was feeding pigeons on the roof when he heard the shot that killed his sister. Seeing her lying in the corner of the roof, he ran into the stairwell to call for help. He then returned to the top of the stairs, where a single bullet struck him in the head.\nThe rooftop area showed no signs of an explosion. Two large metal satellite dishes were completely unmarked by shrapnel or scorching, although there were three bullet holes in one of the dishes. The wall around the rooftop was unscarred.\nAli al-Mughair said the sniper who shot his brother and sister continued to fire at him as he tried to recover her body from the corner, forcing him to crawl flat on his stomach. The plaster wall inside the stairwell was scarred by at least one bullet, which Mr Mughair says was fired at this time.\nMr Mughair pointed to the spot from which, he says, the sniper or snipers shot his siblings.

But a number of recent fires involving notebook computers, some aboard planes, have brought renewed scrutiny.\nThe safety agency said the batteries were not unique to Dell, meaning that other companies using Sony batteries may also have to issue recalls. Sony has sold its batteries to most of the major computer makers.\nThe recalled batteries were used in 2.7 million computers sold in the United States and 1.4 million sold overseas. The total is about 18 percent of Dell\u2019s notebook production during the period in question.\nDepending on how many of the batteries are still in use, the cost of the recall could exceed $300 million. Dell refused to estimate the cost, but said the recall would not materially affect its profits. Sony, which affirmed today that its batteries were responsible, said it was \u201cfinancially supporting\u201d Dell in the recall.\nDell said it would notify affected customers by mail and online, advising them to remove their current laptop batteries immediately and arranging to send replacements.\nThe largest previous safety recall of a consumer electronics product, in October 2004, involved one million Kyocera cellphone batteries.\nDell has been bedeviled by reports of burning laptops in recent months. In June, a Dell notebook burst into flames during a conference in a hotel in Osaka, Japan. In July, firefighters in Vernon Hills, Ill., were called to the office of Tetra Pak, the food processing and packaging company, to extinguish a notebook fire hot enough to burn the desk beneath it.\nThe battery problem is the latest setback for Dell, long a high-flier on Wall Street. Faced with stiffer competition that has forced price cuts, it has reported lower-than-expected sales and earnings over the last year, sending its stock down more than 40 percent. It is also spending $100 million to improve its customer service, which it found had alienated consumers.\nOther computer makers that use Sony batteries were taking stock today of their possible exposure to similar problems.\nA Hewlett-Packard spokesman said the company\u2019s notebooks would not be affected by the recall since its batteries are designed specifically for its products.\nLithium-ion batteries pack more energy in a smaller space than other types of batteries and are the cheapest form of battery chemistry. So more powerful batteries are increasingly being used in more types of consumer products.\nWhat that means, said Richard Stern, associate director of fuel, electrical and recreational products at the product safety commission, is \u201cmore batteries, more likelihood for quality control problems and for design problems and so we\u2019d expect more incidents and more recalls of these batteries.\u201d The federal safety agency has negotiated 10 recalls of lithium-ion batteries used in notebook computers since 2000 and another 12 battery recalls for other electronic products, including a Disney-brand children\u2019s DVD"}

Many NSW markets are experiencing a good level of buyer activity and steady or improving prices. In many cases, local upgraders are dominating the market but local and out-of-area investors are also out in increasing force.\nCompetition from Sydney buyers is increasing as city dwellers look further afield for investment, retirement or a lifestyle change.\nMany Sydney investors are expanding their search to regional areas as rising prices back home reduce yields. More investors are using self-managed super funds (SMSF) where they are buying houses as well as apartments that deliver strong yields.\nThe \u2018pre-retirees\u2019 \u2013 those that are purchasing now for investment with the specific intention of moving in themselves in retirement; are becoming a significant new buyer demographic.\nPost-GFC, many baby boomers have delayed retirement to give their super nest eggs a chance to regenerate. Sydney\u2019s recent property boom has given them newfound equity that is enabling them to buy their future retirement homes now.\nThis is a very typical scenario in locations such as Byron Bay, Banora Point, Kiama, Berry and Bowral. This is really smart thinking given most regional areas are in line for good capital growth; and strong rental yields of up to 7 per cent means these properties will pay for themselves until the owners choose to move in.\nOf course, we are still seeing downsizing retirees relocating permanently to lifestyle markets, particularly those with easy access back to Sydney to visit the grandkids.\nIn Port Macquarie\u2019s Town Beach, 12 out of 17 in a new luxury complex sold to Sydney downsizers.

{"idx": "35858", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Every November, banks and money experts talk about the importance of financial literacy as part of Financial Literacy Month. Experts recognize the importance of understanding money matters; what often gets overlooked is the lack of financial education available to young people, the effect this has on their money-management skills and the subsequent impact on their financial freedom.\nAccording to the latest census, more than a third of young Canadians aged 20-34 are still living with their parents. While this can be partly attributed to rising housing costs, it also reflects the fact that our young people may lack the essential budgeting skills to live independently.\nMoney may be a finite resource, but ways to spend it aren\u2019t \u2014 a reality that plays out for most young people before their real financial education begins.\nAccording to a study from Cambridge University, children start forming financial habits from age seven. Most children at seven understand the concept of money \u2014 that it can be exchanged for goods (or candy) \u2014 but not always that it\u2019ll do better for them in the long run if it stays in the piggy bank.\nFinancial education should start from a young age \u2014 both at home and in school. Some educators suggest implementing mandatory personal-finance courses in undergraduate curricula, but in reality, financial education needs to start years before university.\nAfter all, by 17 or 18, young people are expected to make significant financial decisions \u2014 should I borrow thousands of dollars to go to university? How can I finance buying a car? How can I save enough to spend my summer exploring the world? \u2014 and are forced to consider the prospect of debt long before they even start to make a salary.\nThe most valuable financial lesson I learned was the concept of compound interest when I was 19. Most adults flunk when it comes to understanding this basic financial concept, which is key to making a savings plan and managing money overall. That high school students graduate without this knowledge is worrying.\nI remember stumbling upon a compound-interest calculator app that breaks down the math. I realized that if someone starts with $10,000 in savings and adds $5,000 per year to those savings for 40 years, instead of ending up with $210,000 as the simple math would show, at a 10-per-cent rate of compounding, that rate of savings produces an end result of $2.9 million. When I saw the math in action it blew my mind.\nFiguring out how compound interest worked was a defining moment in my understanding of money. It made me question why something so fundamental and important in managing finances isn\u2019t a part of the mandatory curriculum in school, like basic math or science. Money is a common thread that permeates every aspect of our daily lives. We all have to deal with it, regardless of how old we are or where we stand in the socio-economic order. Yet, we are failing to teach fundamental money-management skills to the next generation.\nWhile young Canadians fare well in global rankings of financial literacy, and the thirst to remain a global leader in financial literacy is evident in the government\u2019s \u2018Count me in, Canada\u2019 financial-literacy strategy, it\u2019s important that specific programs are developed for children and young adults.\nUnderstanding how money works makes long-term financial goals real, and ultimately motivates you to work toward them. Being able to leave the parental nest and find a place of your own is a rite of passage for most twenty-somethings. But with rising house prices and a lack of financial know-how, millennials have effectively had their wings clipped.\nMoney education from an early age isn\u2019t just a more realistic approach to"}

You cave in all the time, giving me up so I always feel like the loser.\"\n\"I get angry because you are not around to take care of me. If I didn't get angry, I would end up being taken advantage of.\"\nThe fear of conflict comes from the wounded part of you being in charge instead of an inner loving adult. If you chose to show up as a loving adult in conflict, you would embrace conflict as a learning opportunity, regardless of the other person's behavior. If the other person is open to learning, then both of you can learn much about yourselves and each other from the conflict. If the other person is not open, you can still learn much about taking loving care of yourself in the face of another's intent to control.\nAvoiding conflict with lying, addictions, anger and blame, giving yourself up, resisting or withdrawing does not make the conflict go away. In fact, much conflict is about these very behaviors. While a conflict may be about an issue, such as being late, being messy, sexuality, parenting, chores and so on, eventually the real conflict is about protective, controlling behavior.\nAs many of you know, the Chinese symbol for conflict has two meanings: conflict and opportunity. Conflict is always a wonderful opportunity to learn, when your intent is to learn. However, in order to open to learning in conflict, you must have an inner loving adult self capable of taking loving action in your behalf \u2014 of speaking your truth, of disengaging from a closed interaction, of bringing love and comfort to the inner child, of discovering the source of your painful feelings, and what you can do for yourself in the face of another's refusal to learn with you.\nFear of conflict will gradually disappear if you learn and practice Inner Bonding and develop your powerful loving adult."}

And more.\nThe 7-footer out of Arizona finished Josh Jackson\u2019s lob passes with dunks, knocked down a baseline jumper, blocked Dragan Bender\u2019s shot, stuck back an offensive rebound for two \u2013 and more.\nAyton also made plays out of the high post with his passing.\nJackson took a handoff from Ayton on a curl and scored on a drive. Later on, Ayton found fellow rookie Elie Okobo cutting to the basket for a layup.\nAyton also showed quick feet in guarding T.J. Warren on a switch and didn\u2019t allow him to get off a shot.\nBooker didn\u2019t play, as he\u2019s still wearing a splint on his injured right shooting hand. The $158 million man is the team\u2019s best player, but Ayton got the second-loudest cheer next to him in the player intros \u2013 and gave a glimpse of how impactful he could be his rookie season.\nShaquille Harrison probably had the best outing of the four point guards in the scrimmage. He stole the ball from Jackson, hit a 3, scored in transition and put consistent pressure on the ball.\nIsaiah Canaan, rookie De\u2019Anthony Melton and Okobo were decent, but Kokoskov said no one has separated from the pack. Staying consistent with the idea of turning this weakness into a strength, Kokoskov reiterated the point guards may play shorter stretches.\nKokoskov said Phoenix will play \u201ctwo and a half point guards\u201d in preseason.\nThe Suns are still searching for a point guard.

Maybe one of the rookies, Okobo or Melton, finds himself on Phoenix\u2019s G-League team, Northern Arizona.\nMic\u2019d up for the open practice, Kokoskov called for spacing and passing a few times as the Suns were up against the shot clock and had to settle for long jumpers.\nThe Suns were running plays like weaves, but they didn\u2019t seem to be consistently reading the defense to explore the options.\nThe offense will look differently with Booker, but it\u2019s still a work in progress.\nThe scrimmage concluded Saturday\u2019s practice that involved lifting weights and working in the practice facility.\nThe Suns open preseason play Monday at home against Sacramento"}

The Tweet Was Wrong.\nThe GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\nSigh. No, that\u2019s not right. Forget the last century. The quarterly growth rate (red line) has popped higher than the monthly unemployment rate (blue line) several times in the last twenty years.\nComparing quarterly data only, it appears that the growth rate has topped the three-month average unemployment rate more than 60 times since 1948, when reliable government figures begin.\nNot that this comparison is meaningful or illuminating in any way. The quarterly growth rate doesn\u2019t have any direct relationship to the unemployment rate. It\u2019s also spiky. It pops up. It plunges down. The figure gives us a fleeting sense of the economy\u2019s momentum\u2014and its constituent parts can show analysts important things about business investment or consumer spending\u2014but tells us little about even its medium-term health. That\u2019s why most presidents don\u2019t spend much time crowing about three-month stretches of growth.\nTrump, however, wants to convince Americans that they are living through \u201cthe strongest economy in the history of our nation.\u201d According to the Washington Post, he\u2019s made some version of that claim \u201cin 40 different venues over three months,\u201d and as we saw this morning, he seems to be grasping for talking points that might justify it. It doesn\u2019t matter to him if they\u2019re factually incorrect non-sequiturs. So the broader issue here isn\u2019t that the president tweeted another tweet and that tweet was wrong (what else is new?). It\u2019s that he\u2019s commenced another, very specific gaslighting campaign to make people believe a good economy is actually the greatest economy.\nKevin Hassett, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, popped by the today\u2019s daily press briefing, where a reporter asked him about Trump\u2019s comment.\nWhat is true is that it\u2019s the highest in ten years. And at some point, somebody probably conveyed it to him, adding a zero to that, and they shouldn\u2019t have done that. And I can say that at least we numbers geeks here at the white house are grateful for\u2014when the press finds mistakes that we make, we don\u2019t like making mistakes, but we\u2019re grateful when they\u2019re pointed out, because we want to correct them. And you might have noticed that I gave Sarah a bad number a few weeks ago, it was 100% my fault and I apologized immediately. And you would have to talk to the president about where the number came from, but the correct number is ten years.\nHassett is roughly correct about the ten years bit. But again, the fact that Trump, or one of his advisers, tacked a zero onto that speaks to the fact that the president has convinced himself, and is trying to convince the country, that we are living through an economic golden age unlike any previously seen."}

But most never mention Champagne\u2019s greatest raison d\u2019\u00eatre: pairing it with food.\nThe idea of Champagne and sparkling wines being essential on festive occasions has been around for decades. But I always see it as a symbol. If a restaurant patron orders anything with bubbles (cava, prosecco, sekt) waiters often ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d Need there be one?\nFrench Champagne makers don\u2019t like talking about the subject since they have year-round issues, such as: How to market bubbly in the seven months that celebrations decline?\nThe celebrations-with-bubbles thing is based also on sound. The well-known \u201cpop\u201d of the cork and the sounds coming out of the glass signify happiness.\nSome French folks I\u2019ve met have pointed an accusatory finger to \u201cyou Americans,\u201d who they indicate are daft to ignore the best reason to drink Champagne: serving it with food. When it is good or great, pairing bubbly with food can be an amazing wine experience. A key reason is that most bubblies usually have better acidity than most table wines.\nChampagne has always been an iconic luxury wine, but about 25 years ago, the category hit some speed-bumps on the road. In the late 1980s, at a blind tasting I staged of moderately priced Champagnes, a number of professional tasters challenged the authenticity of one highly popular French house.\nI called the American representative of that brand to relay our suspicions about that wine, and asked for a comment. The rep ardently defended the company \u2014 but has never communicated with me since. The bottle was clearly not worth a premium price.\nShortly before that, stories in some French newspapers alleged chicanery (including discovery of some fake Mo\u00ebt bottles being seized and, later, the discovery of some tainted Champagne).\nEvents like this have slowed the rapid growth of French Champagne sales here. But they recovered. Between 1983 and 1986, American wine buyers, spurred by a wave of recently flush younger buyers, doubled their consumption of Champagne.\nAs younger wine buyers began to discover other wines, Champagne remained a symbol of good living, celebrations, and promotions. Then sales again slowly declined.\nToday, from various random bottles of true French Champagne I have tasted, some of the region\u2019s most popular brands are turning out some of the best \u201cnormal\u201d Champagnes in years. The drawback is that prices for some of these so-called luxury brands are quite high.\nMumm Cordon Rouge Brut and Ayala Brut Majeur are nearly $40 a bottle. Mo\u00ebt et Chandon Brut Imperiale and Taittinger Brut La Francaise are closer to $50. Bollinger Brut Special Cuv\u00e9e is $55. And these are not reserve-level or vintage-dated wines.\nAs great as Champagne can be with its unique aromas that include hints of brioche, excellence in high-caliber bubbly can be had from at least a dozen U.S. projects, many owned by European-based bubbly specialists. Most sell for between $13 and $22 and the quality of these can be sensational.\nIn the $8 and $20 range you can find Spanish cava, German sekt (pronounced Zekt) and Italian prosecco.

They have no set office hours and are always up for a conversation, especially if the topic is Israel. In fact, that\u2019s their job. Meet the ranks of a relatively new and growing cadre of Israel\u2019s young emissaries whose mission is to engage with Jewish and non-Jewish students on North American college campuses on any and all things Israel with an eye out for what might be perceived as anti-Israel.\nShe describes Hopkins as a campus that is relatively non-political. Getting students to engage with Israeli topics, therefore, can take some doing. Like her counterparts, recruiting students to go on Birthright trips and accompanying them on their journey is a key part of her work. Often, it is the Birthright trip that becomes a key trigger for returning students to come back to campus as activists and leaders on Israel-related issues. Most return with more questions than answers, and that is also where the Israel Fellows step in, they say.\nThe returnees vary but some do become involved with Israel advocacy and community leadership on campus; others go in different directions. Some focus more on becoming involved with religious streams on campus, others are drawn to social justice issues as a way to explore their Jewish identity, and still others simply enjoy having a larger pool of Jewish friends.\nThe Israel Fellows program is something Jewish Agency chairman Natan Sharansky has championed as an integral piece of his larger vision of bolstering Jewish identity among young Diaspora Jews. Since he became chairman in 2009, the number of Israel Fellows has increased from 19 to 56 on 70 North American campuses.\n\u201cToday, college campuses are one of the most important if not the most important arenas in which young Jews find themselves,\u201d says Alan Hoffmann, director-general of the Jewish Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the four years that a young person spends as an undergraduate on campus, and afterwards as a graduate student, are some of most critical years in terms of their identity development.\n\u201cAdd to all this the issue of Israel and the fact that in the last two decades college campuses have become a hostile environment with regard to Israel. Also, young people often come to college ill-prepared, either in terms of their Israel and Jewish content background or because they might have grown up in a Jewish cocoon. Either way, they then find themselves in a hostile environment at college and often feel under siege,\u201d says Hoffmann.\nFellows like Kahn, 28, say their job is not about sugarcoating Israel and the ongoing conflict. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a representative of the foreign minister who\u2019s there to defend policy, but to help students, Jewish and non-Jewish, to engage, wrestle and have that part of the conversation crucial for the survival and flourishing of the Jewish people,\u201d says Kahn. Israel Fellows say there is a problem co-hosting events with groups that they say seek to delegitimize Israel, but not with individuals or groups, including those from Israel, that ask hard questions. For example, Kahn says, a student who plans to join the Israeli army himself hosted a book club event to discuss a new book published by Breaking the Silence, an organization of veteran Israeli combat soldiers who have served in the West Bank and Gaza and share their stories as soldiers there to stimulate critical debate within Israel.

This paid offering, as well as revenue from other sources like a feature that charges landlord to promote their listings, has allowed Zumper to approach nearly $5M in yearly revenue run rate.\nWhile some of the funding will go to scaling and improving Zumper\u2019s core search product, the startup also plans to use the money to launch a brand new product offering \u2013 designed to help renters even after they are done with the search process.\nWhile the company declined to give specific details, CEO Anthemos Georgiades explained that currently Zumper loses control of the process once renters move past the search stage and start interacting with brokers and landlords.\nEssentially even if Zumper can provide a great search experience customers may still end up disappointed if they get stuck with a bad broker. So the new product is designed to shepherd renters through the entire rental process from start to finish.\nA product like this could be much more lucrative than apartment searches, since Zumper may be able to put itself in a position to collect broker commissions \u2013 which can be as much as 12-15% of a tenant\u2019s yearly rent.\nGeorgiades explained that providing product like this was always the company\u2019s goal \u2013 but instead of having to grow it from scratch, when the company first launched it made the strategic decision to start in the search market so it would automatically have a loyal customer base when it introduced more products down the road.\nZumper has been quietly testing this new service over the last 9 months, and will launch it in early 2017."}

She and Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office said that she had been offered a seat on the committee but that she declined it, an assertion confirmed by an aide to Ms. Pelosi.\nMs. Pelosi is likely mindful of her own past mistakes. A decade ago she pushed the last major climate change measure hard, an ambitious bill to cap emissions of climate-warming pollution, then allow industries to trade emissions credits on a pollution credit market. Through force of will, she got the cap-and-trade measure through the House, only to see it die in the Senate without a vote. The next year, Democrats were swept from power, in part because of that vote and the Republicans\u2019 framing of it as a stealth tax hike.\nIn that Congress, she had a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, Barack Obama. This time, she has Mr. Trump, a president who calls climate change a hoax, and a Senate in the control of Mitch McConnell, a Republican majority leader from the coal state of Kentucky.\nBut on Thursday, she was also intent on letting her critics on the left know about her own past efforts, adding that she had made climate change the \u201cflagship issue\u201d of her first speakership.\nSenators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York; Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey; and Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, also co-sponsored the measure, which has early support from about 60 House and Senate Democrats.\nFor example, the resolution does not specify a date for eliminating planet-warming emissions, instead calling for the elimination of fossil fuels from major economic sectors \u201cas much as technologically feasible.\u201d It also avoids denouncing specific types of clean energy alternatives, specifically nuclear power, which in the past has come under fire from climate change activists despite being a zero-carbon form of energy. An early version of the resolution called for phasing out nuclear energy within a decade.\nThe resolution also sidesteps any discussion of carbon capture and storage technology, which Green New Deal supporters had previously criticized on the grounds that it would enable the continued use of fossil fuels.\nInstead the resolution calls for generating all electricity through renewable sources like wind and solar within 10 years, eliminating greenhouse emissions in manufacturing and forestry \u201cas much as is technologically feasible,\u201d and re-engineering cars and trucks to end climate pollution.\nMr. Markey, who co-sponsored the failed cap-and-trade measure with former Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, said he thought the public was far more ready than in 2009 to support climate change legislation. A decade ago, he said, fossil-fuel backed interest groups"}

At least a decade into operations, the company has yet to strike a producing well, and stock prices have recently tumbled.\nCarrillo\u2019s last day at the firm was Aug. 31, when he submitted a resignation letter. In comments to the Statesman, he ranked guiding the company through the acquisition of its 99,000-acre license to drill as his top accomplishment.\n\"I believe that God led me to Zion and that it was a part of my mission to help guide the company to drill this key, deep well,\" he wrote in his resignation letter.\nIn its vision, shepherding the company to the brink of greatness, the claim has a Moses-like quality to it, one that reflects the company\u2019s biblical orientation. Citing Genesis and Deuteronomy and biblical promises of treasure buried deep, Zion officials have said discovering oil in Israel would be another sign of the imminent return of the Christian Messiah.\nCarrillo, who earned a master\u2019s degree in geology before putting himself through law school, served as commissioner on the Texas Railroad Commission, the state\u2019s oil and gas regulator, from 2003 to 2011. In 2016, he told the Statesman his job as Zion\u2019s chief executive officer was to \"bring the geology that informs the theology.\"\n\"We make our plans for how and where to drill, but ultimately, the outcome, that\u2019s in God\u2019s hands,\" Carrillo said.\nBut so far, the Promised Land has been richer in milk and honey than in oil.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Zion from asking the biblically minded to invest, raising money through stock offerings to pay salaries, office leases and drilling costs.\nIts website has an \"invest now\" button that includes testimonials: \"Zion\u2019s shareholders are unique. They are more interested in benefiting Israel than they are to make a quick dollar,\" says its general counsel. \"I recognize and empathize for your unwavering belief and support of Zion Oil & Gas. I recognize and empathize with your patience in a process that, while arduous at times, is outlined by God\u2019s timing,\" its president says.\nZion Oil and Gas has been coming under more and more scrutiny. \"For a company with no product to sell, Zion is unusual in that it records substantial marketing expenses,\" the Financial Times observed in June.\nThe company has spent millions of dollars on investor relations.\nIts founder, John Brown, calls himself a Christian Zionist, or one who believes that establishing the state of Israel was a prerequisite for the return of Christ.\nOnce a manufacturing executive in Michigan and a self-described alcoholic, Brown had a religious awakening in the early 1980s and moved to Texas, determined to start an oil company after hearing a sermon suggesting the Bible revealed that a massive oil field lies beneath Israel. After losing so much of his savings that he resorted to cleaning toilets at his Baptist church, he founded Zion in 2000.\n\"This is a faith company,"}
{"idx": "35889", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Atop the list of Albany's onerous fiats is the state's generosity in allowing public safety unions to gain binding arbitration. It's Public Enemy No. 1, hurting local governments and, by extension, taxpayers statewide.\nSo why did the Assembly and Senate pass a law Wednesday -- sponsored by Buffalo Niagara's senior Albany powers, Majority Leader Paul A. Tokasz and Sen. Dale M. Volker -- expanding binding arbitration to Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority police and firefighters? Gov. George E. Pataki should veto this bill, as he did last year.\nUnions won this right in 1974 under the Taylor Law, in return for which they agreed to give up strikes. But to the frustration of mayors, supervisors and county executives, here's how it plays out: Any lingering contract disagreements -- most often on wages, pensions, health care and work rules -- that a city and union can't settle go to binding arbitration.\nGiven the law's wording, cities rarely win binding arbitration. The fact is, this doesn't work. Unions learned to play out talks, knowing the odds favor them. They can't do worse by appealing to arbitration, while cities do. The three-person panels are not required to consider if a city can afford the arbitrated award. And the panel must consider peer contracts, which means if one high contract is approved in a region, it quickly becomes the mean for all others as a domino effect ensues.\n\"We see a growing trend of city unions bypassing serious negotiation to go directly to binding arbitration,\" said Peter A. Baynes, executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors. \"So we think that shows the unions believe they can get a better deal from unelected arbitrators.\"\nJust this week, Syracuse Mayor Matt Driscoll announced his city had entered \"a new era of crisis,\" with a $26 million deficit, due in part to a binding arbitration award to city police. California, Texas and Florida public safety unions have neither binding arbitration nor the right to strike. The local case is nonsensical: If NFTA police or firefighters struck, other police or fire personnel would cover their work. With no power to strike, the unions relinquish nothing in return for this gift.\nVolker says it's a myth it raises labor costs. He also said it's unfair the NFTA unions are the only local ones without the right. We say repeal or modify the Taylor Law so binding arbitration is a rare last resort after documenting serious, two-party labor negotiations; and include ability to pay.\nNFTA police salaries are 30 percent below peers, Tokasz says, so the NFTA trains officers only to lose them to other forces, and arbitration could raise salaries and stabilize the work force. NFTA police averaged $65,000 a year in 2005, including overtime, three times the average worker's pay here. Firefighters averaged $46,000.\nWhether the NFTA dealt fairly with its police and fire unions is irrelevant. If it didn't, the unions could file unfair labor grievances with the Public Employment Relations Board. But don't extend binding arbitration to punish public managers for driving a hard bargain on the taxpayers' behalf.\nNFTA Executive Director Lawrence Meckler -- whose agency likely would hike transit fares to pay a 30 percent"}

But analysts said the grinding political battle and days of demonstrations that accompanied the effort could hurt his standing with a public already skeptical of his hawkish vision for Japan\u2019s national security.\nThe debate often doubled as a forum for airing views about Japan\u2019s most important ally, the United States. Many were hostile.\n\u201cIf this legislation passes, we will absolutely be caught up in illegal American wars,\u201d Taro Yamamoto, a leader of a small left-leaning opposition party, said in a committee debate on Thursday. The debate ended with lawmakers piled on top of one another in a melee for control of the chairman\u2019s microphone.\nOn Friday, Mr. Yamamoto held up the voting by taking a slow-motion \u201ccow walk\u201d to the podium to cast his ballot. Other opposition groups entered symbolic censure motions against Mr. Abe and officials in his Liberal Democratic Party or made long, filibuster-like speeches, often repeating the conviction that a military with expanded powers would end up being dragged into an unjustified American war.\n\u201cWe must not become accomplices to murder,\u201d said Mizuho Fukushima of the Social Democratic Party. Similar sentiments have been echoed \u2014 usually in less provocative terms \u2014 by newspaper columnists, political scientists and members of the general public.\nThe opposition\u2019s obstructionist tactics delayed Mr. Abe\u2019s victory until after 2 a.m., but could not prevent it.\nMr. Abe\u2019s critics have a variety of grievances against the defense legislation. Not least is the question of its constitutionality: In multiple surveys of constitutional specialists, more than 90 percent have said they believe that it violates Japan\u2019s basic law, laid down by the United States in the postwar occupation, which renounces the use of force to resolve international disputes.\nBut a less abstract fear of being \u201ccaught up in war\u201d has been just as important in fueling opposition to the legislation, exposing a strain of public unease about the United States-Japan alliance that is usually kept out of view.\nJapan has accepted American protection for ever since the end of the United States\u2019 occupation, and today there are more than 40,000 United States military personnel stationed in the country. Yet the arrangement has come at the cost of Japanese independence, many here believe. The trade-off has taken on new significance now that Japan could be asked to risk the lives of its own soldiers and sailors for the United States in return.\nMr. Abe argues that Japan needs to play a more active role in the alliance in order to strengthen it against threats like the growing military power of China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. His legislation has won support from United States policy makers, who have welcomed a larger role for Tokyo in regional security at a time when American resources are increasingly stretched.\nBut a central question for many Japanese is whether loosening restrictions on the military will put Japan on a more equal footing with the United States, as Mr. Abe has argued, or, as critics contend, turn it into an American \u201cdeputy sheriff\u201d in Asia, its new military powers at Washington\u2019s"}

Is the success of your effort going to rely on a precise ROI goal based on the monetization of those leads?\nIf you answered yes to either or both of these questions, than a non-homepage, unique URL is mandatory. In fact, not only is the unique URL necessary, but a unique landing page is required as well.\nThe first issue that you, as the person responsible for the campaign, will have to deal with is answering the inevitable complaint: \"Hey, what about the awareness of our brand and the homepage of our website that we've spent millions of dollars to develop? How can we not use the homepage URL www.OurCompany.com and optimize the ROI on our brand?\"\nThe response to this question is driven by a line chart. On the left are the words \"Direct Response.\" On the bottom is the word \"Branding.\" As you move from left to right, you inherently move from immediate, direct measurability to the long-term, indirect effect of the campaign. This is an internal strategic decision that needs to be made and recognized before dollar one is spent!\nBy sending responses to your homepage URL, you will be virtually blind to the actual response of the dollars spent. Even worse, your homepage will need to perform multiple tasks - provide the general information for the casual visitor AND instantly allow traffic driven by lead marketing dollars to complete the task without distractions.\nA unique URL such as www.PromotionNOW.com has many benefits. First, it allows you to \"see\" all traffic driven by the exact expenditures placed in the market. A unique landing page is also better designed to maximize the chances that the traffic will in fact complete the information you seek. This optimizing is further enhanced by assuring the unique landing page has no \"exits.\" You've spent the money to get your lead to respond to a strong offer - \"10 Guaranteed Ways to Make $10,000 a Month While Watching TV!\" Now, after they have actually shown up, why would you give them any other option than to fill out the required info and download the answer? Providing buttons to click on for \"about us\" or \"contact us\" just provides the option of NOT giving the info you've paid to accumulate. Your follow-up to the lead and CRM program should be given the task of building the brand and closing the action on the lead.\nAlso, to fully realize the ROI from an effort, marketers need to track clicks to the Unique URL and Landing Page that come from different sources -- say CPA online activity and DRTV. It's sad to admit that programs are declared failures because no one has placed accurate tracking of offline marketing dollars driving online response.\nA unique URL certainly takes care of most of this. But what about TV spots running on one network versus another? How do we know the relative performance of each? Developing unique URLs for literally dozens of media tactics and creative executions becomes impractical. A tracking system that can take the next step and differentiate between variables within the same promotion is critical.\nThere are a number of ways that this can be accomplished. An example is a system that uses a \"prefix\" within the URL and is enhanced by predictive software on the backend. Building such a system on the unique URL www.PromotionNow.com generates a further unique element with www.12.PromotionNow"}

He Was Worse.\nBy coincidence, right after my Comey post yesterday morning the New York Times published a long tick-tock about how and why Comey did what he did. It doesn\u2019t address the question of whether Comey tipped the election, it just provides an insider account of what was going through Comey\u2019s head as he made decisions during campaign season.\n\u2026.It was a by-the-book decision. But Mr. Comey and other F.B.I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward.\nEarly last year, F.B.I. agents received a batch of hacked documents, and one caught their attention. The document, which has been described as both a memo and an email, was written by a Democratic operative who expressed confidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far, according to several former officials familiar with the document.\nRead one way, it was standard Washington political chatter. Read another way, it suggested that a political operative might have insight into Ms. Lynch\u2019s thinking.\nNormally, when the F.B.I. recommends closing a case, the Justice Department agrees and nobody says anything\u2026.The document complicated that calculation, according to officials. If Ms. Lynch announced that the case was closed, and Russia leaked the document, Mr. Comey believed it would raise doubts about the independence of the investigation.\n\u2026.By scolding Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey was speaking not only to voters but to his own agents. While they agreed that Mrs. Clinton should not face charges, many viewed her conduct as inexcusable. Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks made clear that the F.B.I. did not approve.\nFormer agents and others close to Mr. Comey acknowledge that his reproach was also intended to insulate the F.B.I. from Republican criticism that it was too lenient toward a Democrat.\nMr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling\u2026.At their second meeting, Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.\nAgents felt they had two options: Tell Congress about the search, which everyone acknowledged would create a political furor, or keep it quiet, which followed policy and tradition but carried its own risk, especially if the F.B.I. found new evidence in the emails.\n\u2026.Conservative news outlets had already branded Mr. Comey a Clinton toady. That same week, the cover of National Review featured a story on \u201cJames Comey\u2019s Dereliction,\u201d and a cartoon of a hapless Mr. Comey shrugging as Mrs. Clinton smashed her laptop with a sledgehammer.\nCongressional Republicans were preparing for years of hearings during a Clinton presidency.

She\u2019s a widow with two grown children.\n\u201cDo I have enough income to carry me through my remaining years?\u201d she asks in an e-mail.\nMillie has about $250,000 in financial assets and owns her Toronto condo outright. Her income is made up of withdrawals from her registered retirement income fund (RRIF), monthly payments from a non-indexed annuity that she bought when interest rates were higher, her defined-benefit work pension and Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits. Altogether, this adds up to about $60,445 a year before tax.\n\u201cMy RRIF is getting depleted because I have to take out about 9 per cent a year,\u201d Millie writes. She wonders if she should increase her exposure to stocks to boost her returns. Her adviser assures her she is on track. She also wonders whether her tax-free savings account is properly invested.\nWe asked Michael Cherney, an independent Toronto financial planner, to look at Millie\u2019s situation.\n\u201cMore than half of Millie\u2019s income \u2013 her pension and government benefits \u2013 is indexed, which gives her a nice measure of income security,\u201d Mr. Cherney says. Of the remainder, about 18.5 per cent of her income comes from a non-indexed, registered annuity and 27 per cent from her RRIF.\n\u201cShe has some concern about her minimum RRIF withdrawal rate, which will be 8.51 per cent in 2019. That rate is likely to outpace her return on investments, so she is concerned that her RRIF assets will dwindle too quickly,\u201d the planner says.\n\u201cMy advice to Millie is that there is nothing to stop her from saving some of her RRIF withdrawals in her TFSA, which is precisely what she is doing,\u201d Mr. Cherney says.\nBecause her annuity is not indexed, \u201cshe will likely not be able to continue saving $300 a month for much longer (to her TFSA) and may eventually have to start withdrawing from it instead,\u201d the planner says.\nMillie\u2019s safety valve is her $750,000 condo. If her health was to take a turn and she needed assistance, she could sell the condo, invest the proceeds then rent an apartment in an assisted-living place. \u201cAnother option would be a reverse mortgage,\u201d which would allow her to stay put.\nLooking at Millie\u2019s investments, Mr. Cherney notes that some carry fairly high fees. Her entire RRIF is in one income fund, an \u201cF\u201d class mutual fund with a management expense ratio of 1.11 per cent a year, with about 41 per cent stocks and 59 per cent bonds. \u201cWhile not terrible, there are better choices, including low-cost exchange-traded funds,\u201d the planner says. In addition to the MER, Millie is paying an annual account fee \u2013 based on assets under management \u2013 of 2 per cent, which is \u201cvery high,\u201d he adds.\nMillie\u2019s TFSA holds a dividend mutual fund (16 per cent), a savings account (16 per cent) and a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) whose return is linked to a stock market index."}

This one is on display at Web Summit.\nThose devices generate a tremendous amount of data: 500MB per hour for an older model like a Ford Explorer and 25GB an hour for a new model like a Fusion Energi, he said. That's enough to fill up a Blu-ray disc every two hours. That data rate could increase as cars get 3D laser scanners to judge the world around them, cameras to spot drowsy drivers, microphones used to cancel noise and any number of other sensors.\nCar sensors, combined with Internet services, will improve the automotive experience, Butler believes.

Additionally, participants were surveyed multiple times over the study period and asked to assess both their current physical and mental health. For physical health assessments, participants were asked, \u201cHow would you rate your health at the present time?\u201d, and told to respond on a scale of 1-5, in which 1 was poor and 5 was excellent.

Bill Clark has worked long and hard and has developed a Google Earth interface which shows more information, and with more accuracy, than any other real estate listing service I've seen to date. Once you visit his Earthpoint listings page for finding listings, you select \"Listing Category\" ('residential' is default), and then select characteristics you are looking for (e.g. 500,000 to 2,000,000 price range). You then select \"Count\" to see how many listings you will get. Or, just go ahead and select \"Download to Google Earth\".\nEach listing is identified to roof-top accuracy (if the house is built). And, as with other listings, clicking on a placemark shows more information about the listing, usually a photo, and a link to more info at the web site. But, Earthpoint goes further, the property lines are also drawn (in yellow). Some of the developments have scanned maps overlayed as well. This is more like Geographic Information System (GIS) data than the typical placemark for a listing you see in most listing services. Earthpoint does point out on the page that this information is not guaranteed for accuracy, that the buyer is responsible for checking with legal resources for accurate property layout. But, this definitely helps when trying to understand extent of property and its relation to the nearby environment. So, if you're looking for property in Boise, this is the best way to do it. Excellent work Bill!\nYep, Google Earth has my house number wrong too, so when you enter my address it points to a house down the street from me.

I see people have had a hard time getting Google to correct this - any thoughts on how to attempt a correction? Thanks.\n\"We're aware that some addresses are not roof-top accurate. This is the result of how addresses are matched up to an exact position on the Earth. We rely on a technique called \"address interpolation,\" which is a fancy way of saying that we take our best guess. More specifically, we take the total number of addresses in a given block and assume an even distribution of the addresses along that block. For example, if there are ten addresses for the 800 block of Main Street, we assume that the fifth address is located at the halfway point. \""}

The process wastes money, drives up the costs of goods and leaves trucks loaded with cargo idling inside U.S. borders, the agency says.\nUnder the terms of the test program, Mexican trucks must meet all U.S. safety standards and be insured with a U.S.-licensed firm.\nThe new program also allows for an equal number of U.S. trucking companies to make deliveries and pickups in Mexico.\nAccess to all U.S. highways for Mexican trucking companies was promised by 2000 under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, as was access through Mexico for U.S. carriers.\nThe Transportation Department said it won\u2019t proceed with the program until its inspector general completes an audit, but said it hopes to begin giving Mexican trucks full access to U.S. roads by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met and exceeded every requirement put into place for this program, and are moving forward with a careful and safe plan,\u201d said Melissa Mazzella DeLaney, a spokeswoman with the Transportation Department\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\nBut many on Capitol Hill say that despite the precautions, there is no way to ensure that all Mexican trucks on U.S. roads will be safe.\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress and the American people seriously question the ability of Mexican motor carriers and drivers to adhere to our country\u2019s strict safety rules, as well as the administration"}

This, it hopes, will attract trade, which should improve pricing efficiency and boost its economy by encouraging LNG flows through Singapore.\nIn the past four years, around 20 gas trading desks have been set up in Singapore \u2013 only 10 fewer than the UK \u2013 as the city-state welcomes traders to store and re-export LNG.\nSingapore sits at the heart of global sea trade routes, making it well placed to take advantage of the growing global LNG trade. Still, Singapore\u2019s efforts are small relative to the size of the Asia-Pacific gas market, and there could be room for further growth. The country is connected to the big producers of the region \u2013 Indonesia and Malaysia \u2013 and a trading hub would have powerful effects beyond its borders.\nSLNG has expanded its facility rapidly. The company began operating the terminal in 2013 with two 180,000 cm storage tanks and an initial throughput capacity of 3.5m t/y. A third 180,000 cm tank and more regasification facilities were added in early 2014, boosting throughput to 6m t/y, far exceeding BG Group\u2019s 20-year deal to supply Singapore with 3m t/y for domestic use.\nSingapore\u2019s Energy Market Authority (EMA) is seeking bidders to supply an additional 1m t/y to help meet domestic demand"}
{"idx": "35916", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Require employers who do not offer retirement plans to offer their workers access to automatic IRAs and contribute via payroll deduction.\nBy Katie Sanders on Thursday, December 15th, 2016 at 3:19 p.m.\nPresident Barack Obama sought to make retirement savings easier for more than half of full-time American workers who do not have access to an account through their jobs.\nObama tried, but he did not accomplish his big goal of requiring employers to offer automatic enrollment in Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs. The idea behind this is that substantially more workers would save for retirement if they had to opt out of automatic payroll contributions instead of opting in.\nObama pushed, every year, for Congress to pass a bill. But the legislative branch didn't bite.\nSo Obama pursued smaller solutions within his executive authority.\nThe first, and perhaps most significant, came through the Treasury Department in 2014: the creation of the \"MyRA\" savings account.\nThese accounts are aimed at workers who are not offered a retirement option from their employers \u2014 predominantly in lower-income fields. Bank fees and minimum contribution requirements discourage some middle- and lower-income workers from starting and maintaining a savings account on their own. With a MyRA, someone could start an account backed by the Treasury with as little as $25 and contribute $5 tax-free from each paycheck.\n\"It's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg,\" Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address. \"MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\"\nAbout 20,000 Americans signed up for a MyRA after the program's launch in November 2015, the Treasury Department said.\nOne year in, that is progress. But it remains a far cry from an estimated 55 million workers without access to a workplace plan and millions more who do not use accounts that are offered.\nTeresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research, gives Obama credit for working within his constraints.\n\"He was able to really lay the framework for a bold solution to probably the worst economic problem facing working households,\" she said.\nAs Obama's proposals floundered year after year, some states moved to create auto-enrollment programs on their own.\nThere was some uncertainty, though, about whether state-backed programs would have to comply with strict requirements for employers under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\nIn August 2016, Obama's Labor Department issued a new rule clarifying that they did not.\n\"If the federal government can't move the needle, then we have to do everything possible to encourage innovation that's already happening at the state level,\" said Tom Perez, Labor Department secretary, in announcing the rule's development.\nFive states \u2014 California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon \u2014 had implemented auto-enrollment programs in IRAs for residents without access to a 401(k) plan before the Labor Department rule. Another three \u2014 Massachusetts, New Jersey and Washington \u2014 had come up with similar programs with a marketplace approach.\nLegislation has been introduced in 24 additional states, according to AARP.\nThe Labor Department released a similar proposal for large city and county governments (areas with populations larger than the least populous state of Wyoming). According to the White House, this rule is currently under review.\nTens of millions of Americans are still not offered automatic enrollment in IRAs from employers, but Obama"}

There is a need for new officials for the upcoming season and if you want to officiate you are in luck.\nNo experience no problem the Boise Softball umpires association will train you before the start of the season. You have the chance to set your own schedule to umpire games.\nNew umps usually work on a two-person crew and will be given the chance to learn the sport. Just head over to here to learn more about becoming an umpire.\nQ \u2013 What is the Boise Softball Umpires Association?\nA \u2013 The Boise Softball Umpires Association (BSUA) is a not-for-profit organization of approximately 70 umpires who umpire softball games scheduled by the City of Boise, City of Meridian, and the Treasure Valley Fast Pitch Association. The BSUA was formed in the mid-1930\u2019s and umpires USA Softball (previously known as ASA Softball) games.\nQ \u2013 How many games do the BSUA cover?\nA \u2013 In 2016, the BSUA umpired over 5,500 games. With games being a mixture of 1-umpire and 2-umpire games, the BSUA had over 9,100 individual umpire slots used in the 2016 season.\nQ \u2013 How long is the softball season?\nA \u2013 The City of Boise and City of Meridian begin their seasons in Mid-April. The City of Meridian concludes in early September and the City of Boise concludes in early October. The Treasure Valley Fast Pitch Association season runs from June to August. League games are Monday through Friday nights starting at 6:15. There is also a Sunday night league with games that start at 3:00 pm. We also umpire various weekend tournaments throughout the season.\nQ \u2013 What is the per-game pay?\nA \u2013 Umpire pay is different for 1-umpire games versus 2-umpire games. In 2016, 2-umpire games paid $19.40 per game per each umpire. 1-umpire games paid $22.40 per game. After two seasons of umpiring experience, these rates increase $2.00 per game per umpire. Umpires are paid every two weeks throughout the season.\nQ \u2013 How many games will I umpire?\nA \u2013 A big factor on that question will be based on your availability. We allow umpires to tell us which days they are available to work and then fill the assignments. On any given night, there can be over 30 umpires working. For a season, the average umpire will officiate approximately 150 games.\nQ \u2013 I still play softball, can I umpire?\nA \u2013 Absolutely!

Ocasio-Cortez, who supports Medicare-for-all and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is expected to win against any Republican opponents in November, which would make her the youngest woman elected to Congress.\nCrowley is the first Democratic incumbent and third overall to lose reelection in a primary this year, but two other New York representatives faced tougher-than-expected challenges from more progressive candidates.

Jealous ran on a progressive platform that included legalized marijuana and free college.\nJealous would be the first African-American governor of Maryland if he defeats incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in November. The last Republican governor to win reelection in the state was Theodore McKeldin in the 1950s.\nLess than 24 hours after President Trump rallied in South Carolina to support incumbent Gov.

Simply repealing ObamaCare might save the country from the certain financial and health care disasters it would bring, but repeal alone doesn't address the noble goal of ensuring as many people as possible, and the necessary goal of curbing runaway health care inflation. There is another way.\nIt's vital to understand that the twin problems of uninsured Americans and exploding costs were not caused by the lack of a federal solution to health care. Quite to the contrary, it is precisely the government's involvement in this sector of the economy that has caused these problems. Numbers released by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services back in January place the government's share at a little over 43% of 2009's total health care spending, although Cato Institute's Michael Cannon wonders if the numbers should be closer to 50%. Consider this contrast: Senator Jim De Mint has proposed a balanced budget amendment that would limit government spending to 20% of GDP, and that has many on the left (and the right, but for different reasons) completely apoplectic. Apparently 20% of the entire economy is too little for the left but nearly half of a huge sector of our economy is just fine. But more on government's meddling later.\nFor almost anyone having health insurance, the exact cost of services delivered is rarely questioned. When your doctor says, \"We're going to order some tests...\", or, \"I'd like you to get an MRI...\", you probably reply \"OK, sure.\". Let's assume that these tests and scans are unquestionably required. There may be several labs in the area that could do those tests, or a few different facilities with MRI equipment, but more than likely, you'll take your doctor's recommendation (\"we have a lab right down the hall\") and go through the motions.\nWith almost any other purchasing decision, it would not be uncommon to shop around for your personally desired mix of quality versus price versus service versus location versus whatever.\nHowever, for some reason, we've allowed our medical care transactions to be treated differently. With a lot of insurance plans, the aforementioned tests and MRI's probably won't even be billed to you. You'll never know what they really cost.\nBut what of the situation that precipitated those tests? Perhaps it was a physical, which being a responsible person you've had annually for as long as you remember. Similarly, you probably change the oil in your car on a regular basis.\nDo you file a claim with your auto insurance company to change your oil?\nAnd there you have two of the major reasons health care is so expensive, and why health insurance, which isn't the same as health care, is equally so.\nNow few people would suggest that you should question your doctor's every recommendation. You'd find your customer or boss questioning your every action equally irritating and disrespectful. And few people would argue for skipping annual physicals on a regular basis as a cost-saving measure.\nBut in health care have we somehow reached a place where we use insurance to pay for things that have very high probabilities of occurring. Insurance was invented to protect against calamities that hopefully never happen. Companies that sell insurance employ armies of people who try to predict the likelihood of these calamities.

In other words, economic growth in less developed countries appears to drive deforestation.\nThe environmental Kuznets curve describes the environmental impact of economic growth in differently sized economies. In theory, the curve suggests pollution and other environmental problems will rise as less developed economies grow. But at a certain point, a growing economy matures enough that the environmental consequences of economic growth slow and begin to reverse.\nResearchers in Laxenburg, Austria, looked at forest cover and deforestation rates, as well as economic data from 130 different countries.\n\"This study was like a large-scale, natural experiment, which in economics is extremely rare,\" study leader Jesus Crespo Cuaresma, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA, said in a news release. \"For the first time, we were able to empirically assess this effect in a convincing fashion, making use of natural borders.\"\nThe data revealed only half a curve.

Bush and Sen. John F. Kerry are finally engaging in a concerted argument about what the nation's next steps in Iraq should be.\nThe bad news is that their descriptions of Iraq's current situation are so far apart they sound as if they're talking about a different country.\nIn any case, debating whether the US needs to send more troops, or ask for more NATO involvement, may be somewhat beside the point. It's true that the next president, whoever it is, will have important choices to make in regards to US policy. But in Iraq the US may now simply be riding a tiger. The most important American actions to come may be those taken in response to events which have yet to occur.\n\"There is a real question whether the course of events there can be influenced by anything the US does,\" says Ivo Daalder, senior fellow in foreign-policy studies at the Brookings Institution.\nWith election day now less than six weeks away, it seems increasingly likely that Iraq, and the general issue of terrorism and security, will be the hinge on which the vote swings.\nSenator Kerry will undoubtedly make forays into the territory of domestic issues, particularly healthcare and jobs. But with his pointed speech Monday, in which he judged Mr. Bush's policies harshly, Kerry served notice that he will try and reframe the Iraq debate on his own terms.\nPresident Bush has \"misled, miscalculated, and mismanaged\" virtually everything about the conflict in Iraq, Kerry charged.\nBush himself, on the other hand, continued with his \"steady as she goes\" message in his speech to the UN Security Council on Tuesday.\n\"Today, the Iraqi people are the path to democracy and freedom,\" Bush said.\nTo some extent Senator Kerry has already tried, without notable success, to attract more voters with comprehensive Iraq critiques. The difference this week is that he used notably stronger language, and all but said that if he had been in charge in 2003 he would not have invaded Iraq when Bush did.\nIn addition, Kerry combined criticism of Bush's past actions with his own prescriptions for the future. As he has previously, Kerry said that Bush should immediately take steps to repair alliances, accelerate the creation of Iraqi security forces, move faster on reconstruction, and ensure elections.\nBut for Kerry the problem here is that to some extent these are all things that the Bush administration is trying to do.\nFor instance, it's possible that NATO allies would be amenable to sending troops to Iraq in support of a President Kerry, but at this point, given the opposition of their own publics, that still looks unlikely. And President Bush has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to cobble together a UN security force to guard the election infrastructure for Iraq's scheduled January vote.\nFurthermore, the administration is already trying to accelerate the creation of Iraqi security forces - witness this week's proposal to Congress to switch $3 billion from reconstruction to security programs.\nKerry has provided some details about how he might achieve his broad goals. He proposes to open up redevelopment of Iraq's oil industry to other nations, for example, as a way of winning more security and reconstruction aid.\nBut on the whole his critique lacks specificity, according to Anthony Cordesman, an expert on military affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"The difficulty is that Senator Kerry's criticisms have not"}

The iconic Volkswagen Beetle, as it came to be known, was originally marketed to the subjects of the Third Reich as the KdF-wagen, or \u201cstrength through joy\u201d-car. Few Beetles were actually produced during the Nazi era, as the firm\u2019s Wolfsburg factory put its resources mainly towards the war effort. But eventually, in occupied postwar West Germany, the brilliantly designed little VW, air-cooled, cheap, and surprisingly spacious, started rolling off the line in big numbers, and a car born from fascism became an unlikely phenomenon, especially among free Europe\u2019s rising middle class and, later, the anti-authoritarian counterculture that developed on both sides of the Atlantic. By the new millennium, VW Group was one of the biggest players in the global auto industry, and it owned a bouquet of prestigious marques, including Rolls Royce, Audi, and Porsche.\nThe reporter Jack Ewing has been covering the scandal faithfully from Germany for The New York Times since it broke. His timely new book, Faster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal, takes readers through the combination of pressures that produced what may be the biggest corporate scandal ever, detailing the company\u2019s personalities and the history behind the saga with fluency and wit. I recently spoke to Ewing about the ongoing scandal, what it means for Volkswagen, and what it says about the future of how cars will be powered. The interview that follows has been edited for length and clarity.\nNicholas Clairmont: One of the most striking things in the book was how you traced themes from the early history of Volkswagen through to the current scandal. A lot of people may not know that Volkswagen\u2019s story begins in the Nazi era.\nIn 1992, Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the grandson of [VW\u2019s founder and the designer of the Beetle] Ferdinand Porsche, became the chief executive. He's the one who really then created the corporate culture that existed when the cheating, the fraud, first came into being. So I think the connection is in a way a family connection.\nClairmont: In the book, you also brought up some more structural causes of the scandal. It sounds like one key feature of the company is that, thanks to a settlement in the 1940s between the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch family and the occupying coalition in postwar West Germany, the regional government and employees get seats on the corporate board. Can you talk about how that shapes how executives behave?\nEwing: Right, the structural thing is the degree of power that the workers have. The temptation this created for management was, you never had to worry about any outsiders if you could appease the workers and the state of Lower Saxony . It allowed the chief executives, if they were willing to sort of make this pact with the workers and the politicians, to have almost dictatorial power, more power than one would get at other companies. There was no real oversight from shareholders.\nClairmont: I want to ask about the role America plays in the context of the Volkswagen scandal. If I were a European Volkswagen customer, I would of course feel cheated by Volkswagen. But I would also feel cheated by the regulators in Europe, who didn\u2019t do a good job enforcing the rules, and I"}

No noise causes cancer.\nSo where did this bizarre idea come from? It\u2019s perhaps impossible to know how Trump came to embrace it (although he has a personal history of despising and denigrating wind turbines). It is possible, however, to trace this weird and wacky conspiracy theory back to the pseudoscientific and totally debunked \u201cresearch\u201d on which it\u2019s based.\nFreelance writer Philip Jaekl did just that in a fascinating article published a couple of years ago in the Atlantic.\n\u201cSensationalistic reports on the dangers of low-frequency sound originate from the unscientific research of the Russian-born French scientist Vladimir Gavreau in the 1960s,\u201d he writes.\nWhile Gavreau\u2019s research did indeed show some of the harmful effects of sound, what accounts of his research have overlooked is the difference between volume, which is perceived as loudness, and frequency, which relates to our perception of pitch. The notion that infrasonic frequencies are inaudible is actually a myth, because sounds within this range can be heard if presented at high enough volumes. Based on the numbers in his publication, Gavreau\u2019s exploits involved dangerously high volumes, causing the reported \u201cinfrasonic\u201d frequencies to be incredibly loud \u2014 levels that would be considered outrageously unethical by today\u2019s standards. They were very likely to have been harmful, regardless of frequency.\nIt\u2019s even been used to explain (without any evidence) the \u201canxiety and eyeball vibration\u201d that people experience when they believe a building is haunted.\nBy the 1990s, when the construction of wind turbines began to take off, people opposed to the large, rotating structures glommed on to the discovery that they emitted weak levels of infrasound.\nAnd, as always seems to happen with health concerns based in pseudoscience, the list of symptoms reportedly caused by the turbines grew exponentially to include such things as panic, sleep disturbances, headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea and visual problems.\nThe anti-wind protesters even coined a name for this collection of symptoms: wind turbine syndrome.\nYet, the infrasound emitted by wind turbines is no different from that caused by other common sources.\n\u201cEveryone is surrounded by infrasound every day. It\u2019s emitted by natural sources like the surf, storms, wind itself, our own heartbeat and respiration. We also are exposed to it in cars, from ceiling fans, motors, and urban noise,\u201d Simon Chapman, a professor emeritus at the University of Sydney, told Jaekl.\nSo, no, Mr. President, the noise from wind turbines does not cause cancer \u2014 or any other health problems.\n\u201cThough this of course is another aspect of science Trump rejects,\u201d Chait adds.\nFMI: You can read Jaekl\u2019s article on the Atlantic\u2019s website.\nSubmitted by Bill Schletzer on 04/03/2019 - 11:45 am.\nIt is hard to find the oranges of all of Trump\u2019s dumb ideas.\nSubmitted by Robert Lilly on 04"}

That means more than 9,500 teenagers are capping their public school experience with either a diploma bearing a stamp that they didn't pass the Utah Basic Skills Competency Test or worse, a certificate of completion.\n\"The idea that one-quarter of the students did not pass one or more of the three test areas is extremely disappointing,\" said Sen. Howard Stephenson, R-Draper, who carried the U-PASS legislation in 2000 to hold schools accountable for student achievement, including the high-stakes basic skills test.\n\"We have to remember this one-quarter of students who didn't pass are the students who are left in the system.

Jon Huntsman Jr. have questioned whether the test effectively measures what it professes to, and what these results really mean. And the jury is out on whether the exam will make a difference in a student's future.\nState law requires students to pass all three basic skills test sections and gives them up to five times to do it, starting as sophomores. If they don't pass, one of two things might happen. If they attempted the test they're failing three times, then they get a high school diploma with an embossed stamp stating they did not pass all three sections of the test. If they didn't at least try it three times, then they get a certificate of completion. There's also a state voucher available for tutoring to help students who habitually fail.\nMore than 27,000 students in the Class of 2007 passed all three sections. That's out of the some 36,500 enrolled, the state reports.\nSlightly less than 14 percent of students, or about 5,000, passed none. More than 1,700 failed only the math exam, which historically has the highest failure rate.\nAs for the Class of 2008, 69 percent of students so far have passed all three sections of the test, the state reports. In the sophomore class, 58 percent passed all three on the first try.\nLast year's graduating class was the first affected by the basic skills test, but the number of students not passing all three sections was never nailed down.

They planned three years, with a reopening in 2017 with \u201cHistorical\u201d dropped from the name. Today, \u201cwe are a year behind what we had planned,\u201d said Janet Gallimore, executive director of the Idaho State Historical Society. That\u2019s not a society but the state agency that runs what will now be called the Idaho State Museum.\nDelays are a part of the museum\u2019s legacy.\nWork on the original building began in April 1941, after the Depression-era Works Progress Administration provided $105,000. By the time the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor that December, only the basement was finished. The museum wasn\u2019t completed until 1950.\nIn 1980, a new wing was added. That took three years.\nEarly this decade, officials spent several years asking lawmakers to fund the museum expansion. The displays from the 1980s had become dated.\nThe museum sought input from educators, tribal members and other Idahoans. More than 700 people took part in focus groups. People told executives the museum needed to showcase the history of the entire state, not just Boise and the Treasure Valley. They said the museum needed to incorporate modern technology.\nAbout a quarter of visitors were students, mostly fourth-graders who visited as part of their social studies curriculum. In the last year before the museum closed, students made up 9,900 of the 39,600 visitors.\nThe Legislature finally appropriated money in 2014 for a smaller expansion than originally envisioned: an addition of 18,000 square feet to the 30,000-square-foot building. The museum closed that summer.\nBut Boise had moved past the Great Recession, and construction costs were rising fast. In summer 2015, 10 contractors bid on the construction contract. Each contractor bid higher than the $5.5 million budget set by the Idaho Division of Public Works. All 10 were rejected.\nIn May 2016, after a second round of bids, Barry Hayes Construction of Idaho Falls won the contract for $7.6 million.\nThe state provided $9.1 million for the building and infrastructure, plus $4 million to match $4 million in private donations for exhibits and related needs. Earlier this year, the National Endowment for the Humanities provided $400,000 for an exhibit on the state\u2019s five federally recognized Native American tribes.\nThe project was complex, Gallimore said. It involved the design of a new entrance and lobby, while retaining the art-deco facade of the old entrance and enlarging the exhibit space.\nAt the same time, a plan had to be developed for the exhibits themselves and what to portray.\nThe Nassal Co., of Orlando, Florida, is building the displays. It is making the exhibits in California and Florida, and they have taken longer than anticipated. A collaborative effort to design displays before fabrication led to some delay.\nWhen the museum closed in 2014, it attracted about 39,000 visitors annually. Forty-five percent were Idahoans not in school groups, 25 percent were students and 30 percent tourists.\nGallimore projects the upgraded museum will attract 117,000 visitors the first year, with 55 percent from Idaho, 25 percent tourists and 20 percent school groups.

Leake did not rule out the possibility of making a decision before he even hits the open market, and said he has enjoyed his time in San Francisco.\n\"It\u2019s a strong possibility that this is a place I\u2019d like to play,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just kind of wait and see, you never know what\u2019s going to happen.

The Giants won just three of the nine starts Leake made for them, and they did not win the division. Wednesday night, though, was Leake at his best. He allowed two singles, walked three and ended most counts early by pounding the strike zone, recording 19 of his outs via ground ball.\n\"He\u2019s brought what we were hoping,\" Bochy said. \"He\u2019s young (27), but yet he\u2019s a veteran pitcher.

He\u2019s got four pitches to work with and when he locates he\u2019s tough.\"\nLeake finished his nine starts with the Giants with a 2-5 record and 4.07 ERA, the record partly a result of receiving one or fewer runs of support in five of his outings. He spent 18 days on the disabled list following his first Giants start because of a hamstring strain. And recently he had some forearm tightness that he said \"played a factor\" in his performance.\n\"I\u2019m obviously a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t come in here and do what either they expected me to do or what I expected to do for them,\" Leake said. \"It\u2019s a little frustrating as far as that.

In fact, it represents a departure from the city's existing medical district and an encroachment into the Mid-City residential area.\n\"Let's be clear: They are leaving downtown and going outside the downtown area, \" said Sandra Stokes, executive vice chairperson of the Foundation for Historical Louisiana.\nHer organization was commissioned by the Legislature to conduct an independent assessment of Charity Hospital. The conclusion was that the city and the state would be better off redeveloping its existing buildings rather than constructing a new medical center on the other side of Claiborne Avenue.\nFailing that, Charity Hospital and other state-owned properties in that area may well be left vacant unless a private developer steps in. Stokes doubts that will happen.\n\"There is no need in New Orleans for a million square feet of condos, \" Stokes said. \"And that's just Charity; that's not all the structures combined with Charity and the (old) VA.\"\nIn all the discussion of what the new VA complex will mean for health care in the city, there has been little discussion of what it will mean for the health of the area the state will be abandoning.\nEven if you buy the state's flawed argument that the Mid-City location makes sense, you've got to ask yourself what will happen to all the property the state now owns.\nGiven the sheer number of buildings in the Charity Hospital area, it is unlikely that all or even most of them will be redeveloped in the current economic climate.\nWhat we may soon be facing if Gov.

{"idx": "35962", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: AT their telescopes in the last few years, astronomers have been searching the heavens for evidence that the expansion of the universe is slowing down. The mutual gravitational attraction of all matter in stars, planets and everything else known or hypothesized should be putting a gradual brake on the outward rush of space since the explosive moment of cosmic creation in the theorized Big Bang.\nThe preliminary results of the search are now in, and they are stunning. The expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating, instead of decelerating.\n''Our observations show that the universe is expanding faster today than yesterday,'' Dr. Adam Riess, a young astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an interview last week. An analysis by him and an international team of scientists indicated that the cosmic expansion rate is about 15 percent greater now than when the universe was half its current age, about seven billion years ago.\nThe group including Dr. Riess and another one, led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, used similar techniques of measuring the cosmic expansion rates over time by studying distant exploding stars, called supernovas. At first, the astronomers were not sure they could believe what they were seeing. But as they examined more supernovas and explored sources of possible error or alternative explanations, they have grown bold in describing the implications of their research at recent meetings.\nTranslated, that means the astronomers are increasingly confident that they have detected the first strong evidence that the universe is permeated by a repulsive force, the opposite of gravity. The simplest explanation, other astrophysicists agree, is that the force is something called the cosmological constant. As conceived by theorists, this force is a property of the vacuum of space itself, an energy that acts on a large scale to stretch space and thus counteract gravity's restraining power.\nIf the observations are correct, this is one more case of astronomers handing cosmologists a new piece to a jigsaw puzzle, which is always maddeningly incomplete, and asking them to find a way to fit it into a satisfying theoretical whole. Knowledge of an accelerating expansion could lead to a revised recipe of just what the universe is made of. It could resolve a paradox raised by previous controversial suggestions that the universe appears to be younger than its oldest stars. It could also change thinking about cosmic evolution and the ultimate fate of the universe.\nIf he were alive, no one would be more bemused by this turn of events than Albert Einstein. Soon after he invented his general theory of relativity in 1915, Einstein was unsettled to find it demanded that the universe either expanded or contracted over time. But like nearly all scientists at the time, he assumed the universe was static, neither expanding nor contracting. What to do?\nTo compensate for what he considered a flaw in his theory, Einstein introduced the idea of the cosmological constant, symbolized in equations by the Greek letter lambda. The repulsive energy force would presumably counteract gravity and make the universe in his theory stand still. Soon after Edwin P. Hubble discovered the expanding universe in 1929, Einstein renounced the cosmological constant as the greatest blunder of his career.\nFor years, scientists agreed, dismissing lambda as ''that fudge factor.'' In the last decade, however, they reluctantly dusted it off as a means of balancing the books on the matter and other forces that are required to support the favored interpretation of Big Bang theory.\nIn this model, called the inflationary Big Bang, the universe should contain a critical density of matter, just enough to slow expansion to a halt,"}

I start projects and end them before the materials are gathered. I vow to create an impenetrable fortress in survival mode, only to find myself halfheartedly digging to the center of my world and dying over and over again. I enjoy the building and exploration, but without some instruction I quickly lose my way.\nDragon Quest Builders, released this week on PlayStation 4 and Vita from Square Enix, gives me the direction I crave. Playing as the only human with building skills in an alternate version of the original Dragon Quest game where the world was destroyed, I\u2019m engaged in guided activities right from the start.\nFirst I learn the basics of building. Then I plant my flag in the center of a ruined town to attract other characters. Those characters begin giving me quests. Build a simple room with a couple of mattresses so we can sleep through the dangerous night. Now fetch us some food. Now build a kitchen so other characters can cook while I\u2019m off exploring.\nIt\u2019s a lovely mixture of free-roaming and objective-based gameplay that makes the basic Minecraft formula work for a person like me.\nIt\u2019s not like Dragon Quest Builders is telling me exactly what to build and where. A basic room is an area fenced in with a two-block-high wall and a light source. I can make it as big or small as I want. I can use appropriate materials as I see fit. As long as the basic requirements are met and it isn\u2019t one of the rare instances where a non-player character provides me with specific blueprints, I am free to build as I please.\nExploration is more exciting and engrossing as well. Discovering new materials allows my character to instantly come up with new recipes\u2014there\u2019s no trial and error involved. That might turn off some players, but it works for me.\nScattered across the world are NPCs who will either come join your settlement or offer you quests to learn new recipes, so aimless wandering is tempered with wandering of the aimful sort.\nI never get that lost-in-the-woods feeling that Minecraft often gives me, thanks to easy fast travel and an overland littered with half-completed structures just a few blocks away from being safe havens. Crafting stations also appear in the wild, so healing cream and other survival items are just a bit of harvesting away at all times.\nAnd really, combat isn\u2019t that tough. All enemies have a basic attack pattern that\u2019s easy to suss out, and dodging the enemies who don\u2019t drop materials in favor of those that do is pretty simple.\nIt really is a sort of Minecraft with training wheels. It just so happens that the bike those training wheels are attached to is painted with the delightful Dragon Quest style, with colorful characters, iconic creatures and a horn that plays variations on classic themes.\nMy main problem with Dragon Quest Builders is stopping. Between the questing, exploration, city-building and gathering, it\u2019s incredibly hard to stop. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve saved my game with the intention of doing other things only to find myself teleporting to the other side of the world to see about finding some copper and coal for whatever it is the people in my city wanted next.\nMinecraft will always be Minecraft, an amazing, open-ended creative and social experience centered around stacking blocks"}

CNN reports that the Unha-3 rocket blew up after failing to get its \"Bright Star\" satellite into orbit. In case you're counting, that makes them 0 for 4 since 1998.\nThat has big implications for the North's ability to strike the United States.

That's why you test your rockets.\nBut North Korea doesn't test their rockets. It holds demonstrations of their rocket capabilities, making them seem like fearsome world events. And they either lie about the results or keep silent about the failures. That's the script that played out in 1998, when a rocket plunked into the Sea of Japan (success!); 2006, when another blew up after 42 seconds (silence); and in 2009, when it swore it got a Kwangmyongsong-2 into orbit but no one else could see or hear the thing.\nThere's also reason to believe, with this latest failure, that Pyongyang is getting worse at their launches. \"If the North Koreans were making progress with their missile program, you would expect to see them fixing problems after each failure and fine-tuning the technology,\" says Brian Weeden, a former officer with the U.S. Air Force Space Command. \"Instead, you see a range of different failure modes, indicating they are not really making much progress and actually may be going backwards as they keep making changes without truly understanding what went wrong in each case.\"\nNow, if the North Koreans tested their rockets as frequently as the U.S. (and the Russians, and the Chinese) used to test theirs, then yeah, they'd be able to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.

I was the longest serving American spokesman in history and it gave me a unique perspective on the United Nations and its relationship with its largest funder - the American taxpayer. The reality of how the U.N. works is not what some people on the right and the left would have you believe. As Susan Rice begins her tenure representing America at the U.N., she will find an institution in great need of change.\nWe all want the U.N. to live up to its original intent and be the place where the world comes together to solve international problems. Currently, however, too many members like the status quo too much to want to make any changes. While the United States, Japan and a handful of others are pressing to reform how money is appropriated and spent, others - including South Africa, Egypt and China are more interested in adding new programs and studies (that benefit their own economies or employ their own bureaucrats) with little regard for who pays the bill.\nThe biggest loser is the American taxpayer who is already spending more than $1 billion every year on U.N. dues, peacekeeping and contributions to U.N. agencies and yet has one vote among the 192 others to do anything about it.\nThe U.N.\u2019s effort to support the fight against terrorism is a particular study in chaos. Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, the U.N. committed to fight terrorism and freeze the assets of terrorists. Committees were established and reports demanded of every country as to what was being done to stop the flow of terrorists within their border. Since then, after millions of dollars spent on committee structures and salaries, reports have either been shelved, not used or not even given to the U.N. As Security Council resolutions go unimplemented with no consequences for those who ignore them, more must be done to hold countries accountable. Former U.S. Ambassador John Danforth famously asked, \u201cCan\u2019t we agree that shooting children in the back is terrorism?\u201d To no avail.\n1. Make reforming the U.N. budget process your No. 1 priority.\n2. Don\u2019t agree to any increase in U.S. taxpayer dollars spent at the U.N. until we see actual reforms.\n3. The current committees designed for fighting terrorism are not working and must be changed by demanding more of members, not less.\n4. Global warming, AIDS education and funding, smarter humanitarian assistance, and the protection of children are all noble causes that will greatly benefit from reforming the U.N. budget.\n5. The best run agencies at the U.N. are the ones like UNICEF and the World Food Program where contributions are voluntary, not obligatory, and the top management are responsible to and held accountable by a board.\n6. Fight hard for Japan to get a permanent seat on the Security Council, as it is one of our greatest allies.\n7. The Human Rights Council will not be a legitimate agency until human rights abusers are denied membership.\n9. If you are popular with other ambassadors it is probably because they like the fact that you aren\u2019t asking them to do anything.\n10. You should ignore the far right conservatives who think the U.N. doesn\u2019t do anything good and the far left liberals who think the U.N. bestows legitimacy and therefore must first approve American ideas.\nThese reforms will go a long way toward showing Americans that the ideals"}

God blessed Isaac, and Isaac became a wealthy man. He was a man of peace, and when the jealous Philistines filled up his wells, he avoided conflict. Instead of fighting them, he just moved and dug new wells. Isaac died at the age of 180 years, after Jacob had returned with his family from Mesopotamia.\nWhen Isaac's wife Rebekah became pregnant with twins, she prayed about the babies struggling within her womb. God revealed to her that the twins would become two rival nations and the older of the twins would serve the younger. Instead of trusting God, she began to scheme for her favorite son, Jacob. When she died, she was buried in the cave of Machpelah.\nEliezer told Abraham that he would find a bride for Isaac. Abraham had a lot of trust for Isaac. He trusted Eliezer so much that he put him in charge of everything. Eliezer was free to take whatever he felt was necessary. Nothing was kept from him.\nAbraham lived in the city of Ur (sounds like I\u2019m clearing my throat). God told Abraham that he would become the father of a great nation. Abraham trusted God and was obedient to Him, and, after 25 years, God\u2019s promise was fulfilled through the birth of Isaac. God tested Abraham\u2019s faith by asking him to sacrifice his Isaac - this interaction pointed to how God would provide His only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.

Sarai was Abraham\u2019s wife (Genesis 11:29), and God changed her name from Sarai to Sarah. She helped her husband show hospitality to the three visitors who came to tell them that they would have a son (Genesis 18:6). She later gave birth to her son Isaac when she was 90 years old, 25 years after God\u2019s Promise.\nWhy did Abraham send his servant?\nAfter the death of Sarah, Abraham called for his oldest servant, the man in charge of his household. \u201cTake an oath by putting your hand under my thigh. Swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women. Go instead to my homeland, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son Isaac.\u201d Abraham knew that the local Canannites were involved in various immoral practices, including sexual immorality. Among all the religious rituals of Palestine, one of the most evil practices was human sacrifice -- and in particular the burnt offering of children. Archaeological discoveries and ancient texts show the charred skeletons of children that have been discovered together at Gezer, Ta\u2019anach, and Megiddo in Palestine. Later, the prophet Jeremiah spoke of how that Israelites had built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in fire as offerings to Baal (Jeremiah 19:5).

If you\u2019ve been considering this option, here\u2019s a handy guide to help to decide.\nThe sharing economy has grown exponentially across the world. The idea of ownership has been superseded by the desire to gain better experiences by sharing resources. Increasingly, people are turning to renting everything from property to clothes. Furniture and appliances are no exception. It gives you access to various utilitarian products, without the burden of buying and maintenance.\nHow much does it cost to rent or buy?\nRenting a set of basic furniture and appliances can cost you anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 each month. While this doesn\u2019t seem cheap, usually free delivery and set up, relocation, cleaning and maintenance, and swaps are also part of the package. You can get complete bedroom package for as little as Rs 1,200 a month. This includes a double bed and mattresses, a bedside table, a wardrobe, a dressing table and bed linen. Try buying the same stuff and you will have to shell out nearly Rs 35,000. Not too much, but remember there is an opportunity cost of this money.\nET Wealth crunched the numbers to find out which option works out better. If you rent, you will pay only Rs 1,200. If the balanced Rs 33,800 is invested to earn a modest 8%, that corpus can fund the rent for the next 33 months. After that, the buying option becomes more cost effective. Do keep in mind that after 33 months, the value of the stuff worth Rs 35,000 would have depreciated to Rs 19,879 (assuming 25% depreciation).\nFurlenco offers furniture designed in-house.

The grant to Bell is small, even by the standards of a small fund: just $181,510. Bell says it\u2019s putting in $5 million (though it\u2019s not clear over what period) and will employ 233 people. The company posted 75 tech-support jobs and a handful of supervisory positions Tuesday and the government announced the subsidy the next day.\nYou can\u2019t fault Bell for taking the money if it\u2019s on offer. But it\u2019s not clear why we\u2019re offering this money to a corporation that made $2.4 billion in profit in 2013.\nThe Eastern Ontario Development Fund began as a temporary $20-million-a-year program aimed at promoting manufacturing and helping companies retool in a time of deep tribulation. The Liberals made it permanent in 2012, emphasizing a focus on \u201cadvanced manufacturing,\u201d information technology, tourism and culture. The government credits it with creating 3,000 jobs and \u201cretaining\u201d 13,000 others.\nSimilar funds work in southwestern and northern parts of the province, distinct from the $250-million-a-year \u201cjobs and prosperity fund\u201d that gets more attention.\nThere\u2019s an application process, of course, but ultimately these are straight subsidy programs: The treasury writes cheques to companies doing things the provincial government happens to like. Reasonable people can dispute the wisdom of subsidies as an economic-development strategy, but generally you can see the goal reflected in the businesses the fund has supported.\nThe Deslaurier cabinet factory in Renfrew, for instance, burned in 2009 but the company got $882,000 to rebuild with more efficient, eco-friendlier machines. Beau\u2019s Brewery in Vankleek Hill got just under $100,000 toward new fermentation tanks and a bottling line. An aggregates company in Havelock got $772,000 to expand a plant that makes sand and asphalt-based material for shingles and to do it with less waste.\nThese are small companies, locally owned, that buy stuff from local suppliers, add value, and sell the resulting products locally, too. Ideally the government help will let them expand their markets.\nCall-centre jobs are . . . well, they\u2019re jobs. But most of them are poorly paid, insecure and futureless, the burger-flipping of the knowledge economy.\nAll true. But the jobs aren\u2019t so special that we should have to fertilize them with public money. The ones in Peterborough have the same instability that defines the industry.\nBy definition, a call centre can be anywhere.

This new tool was recently highlighted in issue 40 of the NCSS Newsletter and looks like a promising new tool with good documentation. A listing of \"web services\" offered by the NCSS is presented on this page.\nThe analysis of SSURGO data is complicated by a series of hierarchical, one-to-many tabular relationships between spatial and attribute data. Understanding the structure of the SSURGO database is critical for correct interpretation and aggregation of soil properties. Before undertaking any SSURGO-based analysis please take some time to become familliar with the details on the product, including intended uses, minimum mapping units sizes, and other important details. In addition, becoming familliar with the SSURGO metadata is a must. The metadata page includes detailed descriptions of table structure, column names and units, as well as important information on the sources of much of the tabular data included in a SSURGO database.\nSSURGO data can be downloaded by survey area from The Soil Datamart, with spatial data delivered in shapefile format and attribute data delivered as plain text. Unfortunately, an M.S. Access database template is required to utilize SSURGO attribute data as delivered from the Soil Datamart. For assistance with this procedure please see the NRCS SSURGO page. Using this approach, most analysis of SSURGO must be done survey-by-survey within a GIS environment. For general instructions see this document.\nSoil-Web our online interface to CA, AZ, and NV soils data. Example interaction here, here, and here.\nWe have developed an alternate approach to working with SSURGO data using PostGIS, a spatially-enabled version of the popular and open source relational database management system Postgresql, to store all spatial and tabular data for 138 survey areas. This approach facillitates rapid access, analysis, and aggregation of over half a million soil polygons. SQL (structured query language) is used to directly interact with both soil spatial and attribute data. If other forms of spatial data are imported into PostGIS (such as landcover, climatic data, etc.) nearly all spatial and attribute analysis can be done entirely from PostGIS. A series of examples illustrating common tasks will be presented in the following pages.\nAdjacent surveys may have been composed by different individuals, and may be of widely different vintages. Any given survey must comply with basic standards, but older surveys reflect a more generalized approach than more modern surveys. The figure to the right illustrates such differences.\nThis diagram illustrates the hierarchy of scales involved in soil survey information."}

The 2017 county cricket season began on Friday and will finish on 28 September. In the old days the counties did not play at all when there was an R in the month. This suggests that part of cricket\u2019s radicalism is a fervent belief in global warming.\nAnd, though there was a pullovery nip in the air at the County Ground, Northampton, the faith was not misplaced. A few hundred turned up, respectable enough on a working Friday with the trees still leafless. There were even two groups of kids playing with tennis balls on the outfield during lunch. The Gallone\u2019s ice cream van, which has settled by the West Stand every summer since the world was young, was not visible but there were assurances it would be along when the sun came out.\nAnd the congregation had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Glamorgan reduced to 101 all out soon after lunch, which put Northamptonshire top of the County Championship Division Two, with three bonus points, two hours gone and less than six months to go. Perhaps Glamorgan, who had chosen to bat, were confused too.\nAbout four years ago it was decreed that, to make things easier for cricket followers, Championship matches would start on a Sunday. Well, most of the time. That has now been junked. This round of matches began on a Friday. One bemused Glamorgan supporter said he was just grateful to have the right day. Last year he came up from Swansea for the corresponding match on the Tuesday, only to find it started on Wednesday.\nAnyone could empathise. The Cricketer magazine\u2019s annual fixture wallchart now has to be colour-coded in 17 different shades to cater for all the tournaments, divisions and formats. The Tokyo subway map is simple in comparison.\nIt will soon get much, much worse. As is now well known, the England and Wales Cricket Board has decreed a new Twenty20 competition three years hence, to be played in eight cities, involving new franchises yet to be formed and yet to hire marketing men to think of cliched names. It is an unusual sport that decides to spread the game by removing it from the places it is played at the moment. It will not even encompass the nine Test match grounds. Northampton is the nearest first-class cricket ground for about five million people across a huge area of east and central England.\n\u201cMy opinion\u2019s not printable,\u201d said Dianne Ward, membership secretary of the Supporters\u2019 Association. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat what I said,\u201d said Alan Claridge, a club member since 1960. None of them dislikes Twenty20 cricket as such; they just want to see their own team play it. Which fits with the known pattern of British sports watching.\nYet something else is going on here. The club they love, in a few weeks\u2019 time, will no longer be theirs. Last September, hardly noticed even by the local press, an EGM of Northamptonshire members voted to accept a plan by the club\u2019s board to make the club a subsidiary of a newly created holding company. Control is expected to pass formally from the membership to the new company within a few weeks, as soon as it receives the \u00a31m in cash from potential shareholders that the board regarded as the minimum starting point. They have already surpassed that amount in pledges.\nThere was little opposition to the plan in the end because there seemed to be no choice.
