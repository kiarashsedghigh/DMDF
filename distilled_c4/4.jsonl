{"idx": "4001", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: What is the real subject of Jerome Robbins\u2019s 1944 ballet Fancy Free? The dance depicts three sailors carousing during shore leave in the next-to-last year of World War II, but Robbins has nothing to say about the miseries of combat. And, since we see the sailors only in and around a big-city bar, the choreographer concerns himself not at all with the drudgeries of life in uniform.\nInstead, Fancy Free \u2014 like Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s Stolen Kisses or Irwin Shaw\u2019s \u201cThe Girls in Their Summer Dresses\u201d \u2014 is a meditation on the mostly wholesome joys of young manhood at midcentury: telling tall tales, swigging glasses of beer, taking note of female passers-by.\nIn a sense, the material had all the makings of a memorable ballet. More than most art forms, dance is the dominion of the young. Artists in other fields have the capacity to improve over time: As they age, writers can become more sagacious, painters more adventuresome, and conductors more decisive. By contrast, dancers are practicing an art form that calls for athleticism on a par with that of a professional ball player or a decathlete. And who among us is as limber or lithe at age 40 as at age 20?\nGiven that dance companies are stocked with young talent, it is no surprise, then, that so many of the great ballets \u2014 including, but not limited to, Romeo and Juliet, Cinderella, and Prodigal Son \u2014 concern themselves with characters in the springtime of their lives; ballets that have at their center an elderly figure, such as George Balanchine\u2019s version of Don Quixote, are the exception to the rule.\nEven so, few contemporary creators of dance were as attentive to the ecstatic energy of youth as Jerome Robbins, who would have celebrated his 100th birthday this year. Born in New York in 1918, Robbins enjoyed a career expansive enough to encompass a multi-decade appointment as the associate artistic director of New York City Ballet, where he created ballets with both classical roots and modern pretensions, as well as a long-term involvement on Broadway, where his work included choreographing or directing such shows as Bells Are Ringing, Gypsy, Mother Courage and Her Children, and Fiddler on the Roof. He picked up five Tony Awards in the process.\nRobbins\u2019s legacy, then, cannot be whittled down to a single theme or style, but time and again, he returned to the subject of Fancy Free: To invoke the title of a 1944 Val Lewton film, let\u2019s call that subject \u201cYouth Runs Wild.\u201d As Robbins biographer Deborah Jowitt wrote, \u201cHe cherished youth onstage . . . and he had a gift for creating an illusion of innocence.\u201d To prove her point, Jowitt quotes lines from a poem Robbins penned as a child: \u201cStill dreams of youth I will keep in my head / Till my heart stops beating & until I am dead.\u201d And so he did.\nThe pleasures of palling around would emerge with ferocity in Fancy Free, the first performance of which was presented at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York on April 18, 1944. While loitering outside the bar, the sailors whirl, jump, and unfurl sticks of gum in unison, but they also joust with each other. One"}

Rod Blagojevich, even though the House never passed the bills that allow all of the money to be spent in the first place.\nLawmakers could discuss a massive expansion of gambling, something that Blagojevich once opposed but which he now embraces.\nAnd they\u2019ll do it knowing that the scheduled end of the veto session Oct. 12 probably isn\u2019t the last time they will be in Springfield this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an unusual year, to say the least,\u201d said Sen.

House Speaker Madigan, D-Chicago, scheduled hearings around the state to give those affected by the cuts a chance to complain publicly. Madigan has scheduled a day-long Committee of the Whole hearing in the House to cover much of the same ground.\n\u201cI think the speaker is just giving another opportunity for people who have suffered cuts to come and describe the importance of restoring the money,\u201d Leitch said.\nThe House will vote Tuesday on how much money to return to the budget. Not all of it may be restored, said Rep. Gary Hannig, D-Litchfield, the top budget negotiator for House Democrats. In some cases, he said, the cuts apply to operating budgets for Blagojevich\u2019s agencies.\n\u201cIf he is telling us he can live without the money, we\u2019ll respect his wishes,\u201d Hannig said.\nLikewise, if a university or some other organization believes it can live with the cuts, they will stand, Hannig said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting that everything needs to be overridden,\u201d he said.\nWhatever the House does restore will mean nothing if the Senate doesn\u2019t also vote to restore money.

Second, exclusion of others and pushing the blame for your country\u2019s problems onto other countries. I am good, others are bad. This is problematic.\nIn electoral politics, some people like to use nationalism and populism to curry favor with the public. They put forward slogans, not caring if they are rational or not, as long as they win votes.\nThe combination of nationalism and populism is even more dangerous.

Ellison said the county has a restriction on the funds it acquires from the tax, with 100 percent going to county road improvements.\nEllison said the $1.2 million the county typically collects from tax makes up 38 percent of the road department budget, which is crucial income for the county. He said the county tries to rebuild 300 to 400 miles of its most-used roads each year, in accordance with the 10-year county road revitalization plan he implemented when he took office in November 2010.\n\"We would definitely struggle to complete road and bridge projects if the tax wasn\u2019t renewed,\" Ellison said. \"The money will be spent wisely and it will keep us on track with the 10-year road and bridge improvement plan we\u2019ve established.

Jesus is coming, and Advent is intended to be a season of preparation for His arrival. The Catholic Church liturgical season of Advent is a sacred time for prayer and quiet reflection, as we prepare to celebrate Christ's birth.\nHowever, Advent is much more than recalling the humble beginning and birth of our Lord and Savior. We are also preparing for the future as we anticipate and look toward Christ's second coming as judge of the world at the end of time.\nAt St. Patrick School, each Monday we will gather around the Advent Wreath in our school gymnasium. We will light the next candle for the week and take time to sing and pray and remember exactly what it is we are preparing for on Christmas Day, when the church actually begins the season of Christmas.\nThe Advent Wreath serves as a powerful visual reminder of the holiness of the season. It is shaped in a perfect circle to represent the eternity of God. The four candles used, three purple and one pink, mark the Sundays of Advent before Christmas. The purple candles are reminders that this should be a time of prayer and sacrifice to prepare us for the second coming of Christ.\nOn the third Sunday, the pink candle is lit to announce Gaudete Sunday, a Sunday of rejoicing for Christ is coming near.\nAs you prepare for the coming of Christ on Christmas morning, remember to put time aside to participate in Advent. It is a time for charity and generosity for those in need. Make sure to put aside special time for extra prayer and reflection. Advent is also a time to fast and focus on one\u2019s own spirituality. Finally, Advent is a time to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and take a renewed interest in and a focus on the beauty of the Liturgy.\nWhen the final candle is lit on the wreath and Advent comes to a successful completion, it will be time to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the beginning of the Christmas season.\n\u2014 Randy Hodge is the principal of Portland St. Patrick school."}

As delegates discuss various ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, our next guest has a simple message: keep untapped oil in the ground. That\u2019s oil in the soil.\nIvonne Yanez is an environmental activist from Ecuador, one of the larger oil producing countries in Latin America. Ecuador is believed to be sitting on an oil reserve of hundreds of millions of barrels. But the oil is located in the Yasuni National Park, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. Ecuador has launched a unique campaign to have the international community compensate the country in exchange for keeping the oil in the soil. Ivonne Yanez joins us here in Copenhagen, she works with the Ecuadorian group Acci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica. That\u2019s Ecological Action.\nThank you very much, Amy.\nYou have been speaking out at the Klimaforum across town. Explain this campaign, oil in the soil.\nOK. It\u2019s a campaign that started many years ago in Ecuador, mainly because we have been suffering oil activities\u2019 impacts in the Amazon\u00eda. So we thought that the unique way to save the forest is keeping oil underground all the time and to save, of course, the indigenous people living in those forests. But after that, linking with climate change, we thought that it could be a good idea also to launch this campaign internationally and say that the only effective, measurable way to fight climate change is, of course, leaving the oil in the soil and the coal in the hole and, of course, tar sand in the land.\nWait a second, oil in the soil, coal in the hole, and tar sand in the land.\nYes. This is our slogan now. And it\u2019s a slogan that was taken by other organizations, not only in Ecuador. We have groups in Brazil that want also to leave oil in the soil in Acre region. There are people in Peru that want to leave oil in the soil in one province, for example, in Loreto. There are people in Bolivian Amazon that want also to leave oil in the soil, the gas in the soil, in this case, and they are proposing Amazon\u00eda sin Petr\u00f3leo.\nAnd there are other groups, for example, in Nigeria, that they are making a statement for the government that it\u2019s a better deal, in terms of economics, for Nigeria to leave the oil in the soil than to sell it internationally, because of the damages, because of the corruption linked with that, because of all the oil that has been stolen by the corrupted people there. So they are also asking to leave oil in the soil in the Niger Delta.\nYou have been going to these climate conferences, what, since you were like thirty, in Rio in 1992.\nYes, that\u2019s true. I have been in \u201992 in the Rio summit, and since \u201997, following international negotiations on climate change. And we have been promoting, since the beginning, not the campaign keep oil in the soil, but a moratorium to oil activities. And this is the same. I mean, a moratorium and keeping oil in the soil or just to declare free of oil peoples and territories. So we want to have nations emancipated of the dependence to oil and other fossil fuels.

Because although Gibson disclaims any title to being an essayist -- he says in his introduction that writing nonfiction always felt like cheating on his fiction work -- he's awfully good at it. Even when the pieces are slight -- as a few of these are -- they are always delightful, exquisitely written, done to a turn with both insight and that unmistakable prose that is just shy of spectacular (Gibson once told me that he is averse to spectacular prose, it strikes him as premeditated and ostentatious).\nThere are many different threads in this book, but they converge on a few themes: one is Gibson's relationship to the Internet. He is, after all, the infamous creator of the term \"cyberspace\" who even more infamously refused to use email (he preferred faxes) until well into the net era, a man who is (falsely) reputed to use a manual typewriter in preference to computers. Another is Gibson's relation to technology, design, aesthetics and culture, from the underground rock scene he found himself in as a slacker in his early twenties to the gaudy pulp science fiction paperbacks he reared himself on to the ancient military firearm he found in his parents' attic as a boy. These threads converge in a pair of essays on Japan -- a place of futuristic aesthetics, forward design, and odd history -- an essay on Gibson's early obsession with eBay and the vintage watches to be had there, and in a transcript of a speech on robots, cyborgs and digital brains that is a moving piece of memoir shot through with prediction and technological insight.\nBy many standards, Gibson is a slow writer -- his book publishing career is 27 years old, and consists of nine and a half novels, a book of short stories and this collection of essays -- but he is a very, very fine one. His work has been seminal to many key moments at the end of the last century and the start of this one, and it is a rare pleasure to read his direct reflections on society and his work, rather than inferring them from his fiction. This is a fine and even essential complement to the Gibson canon, and a delight to read."}

Gregory Gause III is Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Vermont and the author of Oil Monarchies: Domestic and Security Challenges in the Arab Gulf States.\nMartin Kramer, editor of the Middle East Quarterly and former director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, has rattled teacups at faculty clubs throughout the United States with a hard-hitting and personalized critique of the country's practitioners of Middle Eastern studies.\nWere it not for the attacks of September 11, the controversies occasioned by his short book would be confined to the academic world, where it has been noted that the fights are so bitter because the stakes are so small. But the fact that the attackers were Arab Muslim extremists gives Kramer's polemic a broader relevance and urgency. Americans want to know why they were struck, whether the blows could have been averted, and what should be done now -- not to mention to whom they should turn for guidance on these and related questions.\nKramer's analysis of this last topic is serious and substantive. Some in the field may be tempted to dismiss it out of hand because of a bias against his neoconservative politics and his ties to Israel, but to do so would be both unproductive and offensive. Books need to be judged by what is on the page, not by the characteristics of, or motives imputed to, the author. If Kramer deserves fair treatment, however, so do those he criticizes.

Maybe this indictment will hardly please a few of our big-headed amateurs who give the impression that the sporting world revolves around them.\nOur sport is mirrored through press conferences and releases but an in-depth study of the true situation, definitely gives a vastly different picture.

This speech, if one were to take it at face value, exhibited a complete lack of awareness regarding monetary matters which drew a sharp & detailed rebuttal from Ila Patnaik.\nHowever, I believe that the speech was made with a very specific intention. While a large chunk of the speech was dedicated to it directly, with the RBI Governor detailing the reasons why he believes that the RBI should be the coordinating regulator, the rest of the speech dealt with the proposed environment in which this should happen, albeit indirectly.\nDiscussions concerning the RBI\u2019s role in the economy came to a head recently with the government replacing the ULIP Ordinance with The Securities and Insurance Laws (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 2010 [PDF]. This Act provides for the establishment of a joint body to reconcile and rationalise jurisdiction disputes between the four regulators (RBI, Sebi, Irda and PFRDA) by a joint committee which apart from representation from these regulators, will have the Union Finance Minister, The Finance Secretary and The Secretary (Financial Services) in the Ministry of Finance as members with the Union Finance Minister chairing it. In a concession to the RBI, The RBI Governor will not just be an \u201cex-officio member\u201d, as stated in the ordinance, but the \u201cex-officio Vice-Chairperson\u201d of the Joint Committee. The Committee will then follow any procedure it considers suitable and inform the Central Government of its decision within three months. The decision will be binding on all regulators.\nThe RBI has always believed that it is far more important than any of the other financial regulators, and with good reason. After all, RBI decisions touch far more lives, and exert greater influence over the economy, than those of other regulators. However, in expressing the underlying reason for this \u201cseniority\u201d the RBI often, intentionally, mixes its up. This was evident in Dr. Subbarao\u2019s speech as well.\nHe takes the RBI\u2019s current responsibilities and builds a case for such seniority being formalized by law at a time when the scope of the RBI\u2019s responsibilities is being intensely contested. To say that the monetary authority should also be the prudential regulator for banks as they are the primary channel for transmission of monetary policy is denying current reality. Financial system risk is no longer restricted to banks and non-banks, including Mutual Funds, play an important role as well. The monetary authority, therefore, needs to have authority over all forms of financial risk in the system. The RBI tries to achieve this by making a case for increased power. I think it is better achieved by reducing it. Let me explain.\nRBI\u2019s role as a monetary authority would be enhanced if it were to delegate all prudential regulation, including that of banks, to other regulators, specializing in various types of financial risk. As a monetary authority, its role can then be strengthened by giving it the power to supervise the functioning of all regulators without undue favoritism. Currently, with bank & NBFC prudential regulation entrusted to the RBI, it has a tendency to favor these over other financial intermediaries, which in reality, works against efficient transmission of monetary policy as was evident in the events of late 2008. In this case, the RBI was very willing to look at the problems faced by banks, but agreed to assist the mutual fund industry"}

Hearings over the disputed area around the ruin are taking place this April at the court in The Hague. Like the temple, the overlapping claims area has been a source of tension between Cambodia and Thailand.\nDeveloping the 26,000-kilometre area, believed to be rich in oil and gas, could mean new streams of revenue for both countries, and for companies holding concessions. A memorandum of understanding to jointly explore the area was first signed in 2001, but in more than 10 years, hopes for the agreement\u2019s implementation have risen and fallen depending on who is in office in Thailand.\nThose hopes went down along with former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, when he was toppled in a military coup. It seemed to stay down three years later, after Hun Sen angered then-Thai Prime Minister Abhisit by appointing Thaksin as an economic adviser to the Kingdom.\nBut in 2011, in response to Abhisit reportedly accusing Thaksin of having \u201csecret interests\u201d in Cambodia, the Council of Ministers issued a statement that detailed closed-door meetings between Cambodian and Thai Democratic Party officials under Abhisit about the overlapping claims area.\nThe council\u2019s Press and Quick Reaction Unit reissued its 2011 statement yesterday, and spokesman Phay Siphan said it was meant to be a reminder.\n\u201cThe Thai people are [still] not aware that the Abhisit government tried to talk with Cambodia secretly about that issue. We want to put it on the table. That\u2019s why we wanted to reveal the fact that Abhisit played with the people,\u201d Siphan said.\nDialogue improved after the 2011 election of Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin\u2019s sister, but in recent months, no significant concrete steps have been announced."}

Upon arrival, protestors took over the fourth and fifth floors of the building and announced they would not leave until Ohio University met their demands that the university commit to not share students\u2019 immigration status with law enforcement, not allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers on campus, protect undocumented students from deportation and provide \u201cdistance learning options for deported students.\u201d In total, more than 70 people were arrested for refusing to disperse and charged with criminal trespassing.\nShortly after the arrests, administrators released a statement condemning the action for disrupting university operations. Meanwhile, the Ohio University student senate passed a bill asking that the university be designated a sanctuary campus.\nBut for many students, including Bobby Walker, a senior at Ohio University and one of the organizers of Wednesday's protest, McDavis\u2019 statement wasn\u2019t nearly forceful enough.\nThe movement for sanctuary campuses exploded after the election.

In contrast, other more conservative-leaning institutions, like the University System of Georgia, have rejected the idea of sanctuary campuses on the basis of that it encourages institutions and employees to break the law.\nOhio University\u2019s position is unclear. Its public statements indicate that it is, at the very least, concerned about Trump\u2019s new immigration protocols. Yet, as reported by the Athens News, Ohio University has not taken a clear stance on whether or not the university and its police department \u201cwill decline to work with federal immigration officials unless they are forced to by law.\u201d For Walker, that ambiguity is unacceptable.\nAlso proud, and nostalgic for OU in the late 60s.\nLock 'em up.

Back when the original model launched in 2015, there was \u2013 not unfairly \u2013 a sense that Apple itself wasn\u2019t quite sure what exactly it should do. Now, as the Apple Watch Series 4 arrives on wrists, it does so not only with a laser focus, but with the compelling hardware to match.\n2018\u2019s Apple Watches are more expensive. The Series 4 starts at $399 for the 40 mm and $429 for the 44 mm; if you want cellular, add another $100 on top. In contrast, the Series 3 started at $329 without cellular, and $399 with it.\nThe design is familiar and yet new. This 44mm version is broader than the model before it, but the reduction in thickness is more important. It may only be 0.7 mm difference, but with it the Apple Watch Series 4 feels less as though it\u2019s sitting atop your wrist, precariously, and more like it\u2019s bedding down on it.\nComponents and controls have been finessed in cunning ways. The microphone has moved to a new spot, between the Digital Crown and the \u2013 now fared-in \u2013 side button; in the process, it helps reduce distortion during calls. Two slits on the opposite side accommodate the speaker and the barometer. The speaker itself is an impressive 50-percent louder, which makes a difference when you\u2019re using the Apple Watch for hands-free calls. Hearing callers over the sound of engine and road noise as you drive is much more likely.\nThe new haptics for the Digital Crown are another example of charming subtlety at work. The tiny nudges that tremble your fingertip are minuscule: the faintest pluck of a quill across the strings of the world\u2019s smallest harpsichord. Nonetheless they communicate a physicality that adds depth to the scrolling process.\nDespite all that, there\u2019s the reassurance that none of this is change for its own sake. Both sizes of Apple Watch may be new in this fourth generation, but all your existing watch straps and bands will work just the same.\nIf there\u2019s a place where fashion rears its head, it\u2019s in the finishes. Gone is the Apple Watch Edition, and the ceramic model. Instead you get a choice of matte finish aluminum or polished stainless steel, in silver, space gray, or gold. The silicone sports bands remain, along with Velcro sports loops, Milanese loops, and an array of leather, Nike, and Hermes straps that run the gamut from subtle through to Gladiator-style webbing.\nHowever you affix it to your wrist, one thing is for certain: the new Apple Watch display is mesmerizing. When you tilt your wrist and the rich, saturated OLED panel splashes into life, it\u2019s as though its colors are flooding out to the corners of the cover glass.\nThe old Apple Watch favored black for its UI because it helped mask the edges of the smaller OLED screen with the bezel around it.

Similar bills have already recently been advanced or approved in the states of Louisiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota, the journalists added, and the NRA is unexpectedly the one that deserves credit.\nFor practically ten years before that, the NRA took seemingly every action possible to keep HB 1840 from being signed into law in Washington. Initially, the bill was written so that anyone alleged to be a domestic abuser would have to hand over their weapons after being served with a protective order, but the NRA \u2014 largely known for staunchly opposing attempts to infringe on the right to own firearms \u2014 has opposed that language since it was first considered by local lawmakers.\nThose changes, Bassett and Wilkie wrote, include altering a provision that will now, if signed into law, allow alleged abuser to surrender their guns to friends and family instead of the state. And although it might only be a minor edit, it could be monumental news for anti-violence advocates who for ages have fought, albeit unsuccessfully, against lobbyists from the NRA who have tried to all but abolish anything that may interfere with the Second Amendment to the United States\u2019 Constitution\u2019s right to bear arms.\nThe Minnesota bill is expected to meet the approval of lawmakers there next, HuffPost reported, and the lawmakers who are sponsoring these anti-domestic violence bills say the NRA is becoming instrumental in helping their fight.\n\"The NRA has been really good to work with on this particular issue,\" Minnesota State Rep.

So the team \u2014 led by Abby King, PhD, professor of medicine and of health research and policy \u2014 custom built three phone apps based on different spheres of behavioral science, each designed to motivate participants to exercise more.\nThe researchers then assigned 95 participants, all who were older than 44 years older, were sedentary and had never used a smart phone before, to use one of the three apps or a control dieting app for eight weeks. After measuring participants\u2019 activity with an accelerometer, King and her colleagues found that a \"social\" app, which allowed users to compare themselves with others, promoted social support for behavior change, and displayed avatars that modeled good behavior, bested the \"analytic\" app, which emphasized self monitoring, and the \"affect\" app, which emphasized attachment, nurturance and play.\nCompared to the people who used the analytic and affect apps, the social app users showed the greatest gains in weekly physical activity and the greatest reductions in sedentary behavior.\nThe research has limitations -- it had a small sample size and a short study period -- but it sets the stage for further exploration into whether different groups of people will benefit more from specific kinds of exercise apps.\nThe study appears today in PLoS ONE."}

The virtual-reality headset designed for gaming applications is now being used by the Norwegian army to help them drive tanks by providing a 360-degree view outside the vehicle.\nThe system consists of a series of four video cameras with convex lenses both front and back of the tank. With each set of cameras offering a 185-degree view, this covers 360 degrees around the tank -- and, thanks to the Oculus Rift's motion tracking, all the operator has to do to move their view around is turn their head. This allows for the driver to negotiate hazardous situations without having to open the hatch and look around.\nThe video game connection is not lost on the team.\nRide the Oculus Rift to outer space!\n\"Those who play Battlefield can see much better than you do in an actual vehicle,\" Making View's Daniel Mestervik told Norwegian news service TU. \"With our software, you can add elements we are used to from games. You can have a map, you can show each orientation, how much you tilt, the speed -- it's very useful when you have to close all your hatches.\"\nHowever, the system can't yet serve as a full-time replacement for looking around. For starters, any equipment placed on the outside of a tank is vulnerable to the hazardous situations the driver may be trying to avoid.\nSecondly, the Oculus Rift technology has its own set of problems, and not just the vertigo experienced by some users. \"It's more strenuous for the eyes, since it's a synthetic picture, so it will be used when you think you could be shot at,\" Major Ola Petter Odden of the army's Combat Lab said. \"Over longer transports, you might want to drive looking out the hatch because it's more natural for your head and you won't get tired as quickly.\"\nThe system -- which has been designed for the military by Hamar, Norway-based imaging company Making View -- is made from standard equipment, including an ordinary PC, inexpensive cameras and the Oculus Rift headset -- all of which is much less expensive than purpose-built military-grade gear. And the teams have high hopes for the advancement of the technology.\n\"The fact that Facebook bought the Oculus Rift means that it has strong financial backing and the development will advance rapidly forward now,\" Major Odden said. \"I'm optimistic we will soon have good enough goggles to run this as an operational concept.\"\nYou can check out a video of the trial via the TU TV website."}

Tweets that accused mainstream media organizations of reporting \u201cfake news.\u201d And later, social media networks that appeared to follow both white nationalist and Wikileaks-related accounts.\nInitially, University of Washington professor and researcher Kate Starbird was studying how rumors spread on social media after disasters; they typically began with high volume after a crisis and then dissipated as news reports confirmed what happened. Then, in 2013, sorting through data after the Boston Marathon bombings, Starbird and her students noticed another kind of rumor\u2014a kind that gained traction and volume over a longer period of time, in spite of facts confirmed in news reports. These longer-lasting rumors often intersected with politicized content. In the sustained chatter about the Boston terrorist attack, they noticed Twitter accounts pushing an alternative narrative, a conspiracy theory that Navy SEALS had bombed the race, not the Tsarnaev brothers.\nStarbird mostly dismissed these kinds of alternative narratives as outliers, a conclusion she would later regret. Then came 2016, when hyper-politicized disinformation that spread in the aftermath of mass shootings and the Paris terrorist attacks was impossible to ignore. She and her team were compelled to dig deeper into the data. And as the \u201cfake news\u201d language of far-right and Russian media conspiracy theorists was embraced by Donald Trump and his presidential campaign, Starbird realized the phenomenon was going mainstream.\nFear-mongering Russian propaganda: Even as far back as 2010, there was evidence of disinformation efforts: around the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

And the founder of 21stCenturyWire is also an editor for InfoWars and an analyst for RT.\nGovernment-backed propaganda: In data from 2014, Starbird\u2019s team recognized a pattern after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine: Far-right and Russian-linked Twitter accounts actively disputed Western media reports that the airliner was shot down by Russian-allied separatist fighters.

We could either do like we usually do, and just say 'forget it,' because they weren't going to understand us anyway, or we could take charge and be the ones to set the pace.\nThese are the words of young black male students enrolled in a class taught by Professor Michael Eric Dyson at Brown, in the spring of 1994. They were spoken in the aftermath of an explosive confrontation with Dyson, which opens \"Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X.\" At the root of this confrontation was a fight \"over Malcolm's tall body and short life, allowing no dibs on a legacy they felt Malcolm had bequeathed to them alone.\"\nI recognized myself in the voices of these young black men. Their words took me back to the many classes and the long hours I spent wrestling with these very issues.

I was tired of the rhetoric of multiculturalism and \"political correctness.\" For the daily experience of multiculturalism didnot feel like a sharing and celebration of our differences. Instead, as a person of color, I was constantly giving myself with little return; I was adding splotches of color to an otherwise drab and homogeneous landscape; I was yet again being told to have patience and understanding, as I taught someone else to understand and appreciate me.

I was looking for a way to keep part of myself for myself.\nIn those moments of vulnerability, it was the words of Malcolm X that comforted and filled me with pride. Malcolm who was \"a vessel for our outrage.\" Malcolm who didn't back down. Malcolm who could meet the white man on his own turf and manipulate him, make him dizzy with the skillful twists and turns of his rhetoric. Malcolm who could spew facts like venom and leave \"the Man\" speechless in the face of his tightly woven and solid arguments. It is this Malcolm who has become inextricably linked to, and indeed the symbol of, a resurgent black nationalism among this generation of black youth. In hip-hop and in rap, over any number of old-school beats and song fragments, it is commonplace to hear Malcolm's voice and image evoked in comment on and indictment of an American society whose racism and violence against black bodies, particularly those of black men, is just as virulent and rampant as it was when Malcolm lived.\nMalcolm X was a brilliant and complex man, and in \"Making Malcolm,\" Dyson acknowledges his centrality in the history of African Americans. But he also recognizes the dangers of \"hero worship\": On the one hand, uncritical and unconditional and, on the other, very selective about the aspects of Malcolm's life and teachings that we use for our own purposes.

He answered questions from reporters and stressed that the top priority for Canada remains the efforts to secure an exemption to steep new tariffs announced last week by Trump.\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re looking for a very clear solution which is an exemption,\u201d he said.\nThose proposed tariffs, expected to be signed into law on Friday, could see a 25 per cent tax imposed on foreign steel and a 10 per cent tax on aluminum imported into the U.S. The announcement of the tariffs quickly roiled markets given the tight integration of industrial supply chains in Canada and the U.S. that rely on the use of steel and aluminum.\nTrump has in the past pointed the finger at countries like China which have been accused in recent years of dumping steel and aluminum exports in other countries at below-market costs and flooding the global market.\nWhile Bains did not single out China in particular, he said Canada recognizes the concerns Trump has raised about such actions.\n\u201cI do understand and recognize the issue the U.S. has raised with regards to overcapacity and dealing with some of the other actors on that issue,\u201d Bains said.\nWATCH BELOW: Will Canada be exempt from U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum?\nBoth Canada and the U.S. are the largest markets for each other\u2019s steel and aluminum exports, with reciprocal trade totalled at roughly $12 billion last year.\nWhile Trump had initially boasted no country would be exempt from the new measures, that claim was walked back within days.\nREAD MORE: Reality check: Does Canada\u2019s steel, aluminum actually pose a national security risk to the U.S.?\nFirst, Trump said Canada and Mexico could get an exemption if they capitulated to his demands on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nThat came shortly after senior officials within his administration including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan publicly questioned the tariffs and international organizations including the World Trade Organization warned the trade war such measures would likely spark could lead to a global recession.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, he said blocs like the European Union could be excluded if they let in more American manufactured goods like automobiles.\nLate Wednesday night, White House officials said Trump planned to offer a 30-day exclusion from the tariffs to Canada, Mexico and several other countries based on national security concerns.\nThose exemptions could then be extended based on progress in NAFTA talks, officials said."}

Because everything politicians promise \u2014 like jobs and growth \u2014 has hiccups and exceptions, and legislatures and administrations change things.\nIf you want to help better fund schools in Miami-Dade, for example, vote to give teacher pay raises on referendum #362.\nBut don\u2019t fall for the line that gambling funds education.

{"idx": "4072", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: To the delight of investors and relief of her euro-zone counterparts, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made some key concessions at Friday's EU summit. But the celebration is premature because she has still left herself plenty of room for maneuver.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has left herself plenty of outs despite her concessions.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel rarely sees these kinds of negative headlines when returning from European Union summits. During her over six years as the head of Germany's government, she has usually been able to put a positive spin on even unpopular compromises.\nBut at the most recent emergency gathering of European heads of state and government, which was held in Brussels and lasted until the wee hours of Friday morning, she had a hard time doing exactly that. Reactions back home were devastating, and there were even calls for pushing back key parliamentary votes on the permanent euro bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), as well as Merkel's fiscal pact scheduled for Friday evening. In fact, the vehemence of the attacks seems to have taken even Merkel's advisers by surprise.\nMerkel launched her counterattack on Friday afternoon. In a post-summit press conference, she said one first has to sort things out after such a long night, and she tried to counter the impression that she had been out-maneuvered by Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\nMerkel underscored that she had pressed to make sure that the rules of the ESM were adhered to. She said she had successfully defended the ESM's preferred creditor status and that only a single exception would be made, for Spain. Likewise, she noted that, if at all, the ESM would only provide direct assistance to private banks after a long process of setting up a banking supervision mechanism, and that Germany would have several opportunities to exercise its veto during this process.\nThough they were worth a shot, Merkel's efforts to reframe the debate came too late. The impression that she had stumbled in Brussels yet again had already had too much time to sink in. With her concessions to allow for a relaxation of the ESM's loans-only-for-oversight conditions and allowing the bailout fund to potentially provide direct aid to banks, Merkel has led the euro zone one more step along the path toward a pooling of debt, an IOU-nion.\nThis is not the first time that Merkel has surrendered what had been repeatedly heralded as Germany's final line in the sand. Every step of the campaign to rescue the euro over the last two years has gone from being a taboo to a done-deal that triggers massive public outrage. Indeed, one could even go further and say that the entire history of European integration has been a series of broken taboos.\nWhat's more, in this game of high-stakes negotiations lasting until 4 o'clock in the morning, Merkel was also holding what were simply bad cards. She urgently needed her counterparts to agree to the growth pact if she was to have any chance of having Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, approve her fiscal pact in a vote scheduled for Friday evening. Time was short, and she needed an agreement. Knowing this, Monti laid his dagger on her chest.\nOnce known, the decisions ignited a pyrotechnic display on the financial markets. Investors were thrilled that the intractable Germans had finally yielded some ground. At least for now, Monti's calculation has"}

By 2006, Facebook offered a cleaner social experience; by 2009, Twitter offered a more casual one. MySpace was a complete relic by this point, even though only a few years had passed since its launch.\nBack in 2005, though, long before MySpace burned out, its founder, Tom Anderson \u2014 whose grinning face greeted every new user as their first \u201cfriend\u201d \u2014 sold the site for $580 million to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. While his site was becoming a punchline during the rise of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the other social media networks we now use everyday, Anderson disappeared entirely from the tech scene. Now, he travels the world, documenting his visits to exotic locations.\nContrast that with what\u2019s currently happening to Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who\u2019s on day two of being grilled by a Senate committee for Facebook\u2019s role in haphazardly collecting all of our personal data, and possibly swinging the 2016 presidential election toward Donald Trump. What was supposed to be a basic networking tool has now become one of the chief mediators of how people interact with each other and the world around them, and how information is absorbed and disseminated on the internet. It\u2019s now apparent that Facebook and Zuckerberg didn\u2019t really consider any of this when aggressively pursuing growth, and now we\u2019re all screwed as we try to untangle the consequences.\nMySpace Tom? His most recent Instagram post from seven days ago is a giveaway for a stay at an Iceland hotel. He doesn\u2019t have to issue any terse statements about his company\u2019s commitment to fostering a healthy society; he doesn\u2019t have to sit on a booster seat for seven hours and take dipshit questions from a procession of Senate ghouls. He isn\u2019t worth as much money as Zuckerberg, of course, but unless you\u2019re an oil baron, $580 million is enough to tide you over for the length of your lifetime, and your children\u2019s lifetime, and your children\u2019s children\u2019s lifetime, and so on. (Even after taxes!) And yes, yes, being that rich is good for nobody, but without getting into an argument about the perils of capitalism, we can agree that personally speaking, Anderson is having a much better go of things.\nIt puts MySpace\u2019s failure to evolve in a new light, as perhaps the healthy thing is for a platform to die and for everyone to move on. Its aesthetic and form, back when everyone had emo bangs and listened to Hawthorne Heights, couldn\u2019t change without altering the meaning of the site altogether, and by that time, everyone was gone. Had Facebook not gotten too good at inserting itself between human users, there\u2019s no way it would\u2019ve run into their current problems at such a wide scope. The suspicious CEO is not the one who cashes out; it\u2019s the one who sticks around and creates a behemoth.\nZuckerberg could have sold off his share and avoided becoming literally one of the most disliked people in the present moment.

It\u2019s vitally important that Wisconsin continues to provide an environment that incentivizes economic growth benefiting both employers and employees.\nNow is not the time to go back to when Wisconsin was one of the top 10 taxed states and property taxes were jumping every year. It is not time to go back to the days where the state was running deficits, playing accounting games and raiding the transportation fund.\nWhat\u2019s the key issue in this race for you? Wisconsin\u2019s exceptionally low unemployment rate is leading to a shortage of qualified workers. Next session, the primary focus needs to be workforce development. This includes giving schools the tools they need to meet the demands of the workforce such as high-tech Fab Labs, connecting schools and technical colleges with business, increasing internet/broadband access in under served areas of Wisconsin, and recruiting and retaining talented individuals to fill the labor demand.\nAdditionally, we need to focus on mental health. Over the last four years, great work has been done to try to fight the opioid epidemic through the HOPE (Heroin, Opioid Prevention and Education) Agenda, including investments in TAD (Treatment and Addiction) courts that emphasize rehabilitation over incarceration for first-time offenders. Unfortunately, there are still too many Wisconsin families that are unable to access mental health services. Two years ago, I authored a bill giving more flexibility to public schools to provide mental health services to students. This new law is just a start, and more needs to be done.\nFinally, I will continue to focus on improving Wisconsin\u2019s tax climate. Great improvements have been made over the last four years including simplifying the tax code, reducing income taxes and repealing the state property tax. However, our work is not done. For example, we should fully repe"}

Those who find the walls of books and vintage magazines in the 6,255-square-foot store also find a treasure trove of knowledge, entertainment and ideas.\nPeople are not just reading the books though. In today\u2019s world, with audio books and digital books, real books have become somewhat of a novelty again.\nPhotographers use her walls of books for picture backgrounds, including the hypnotizing walls of National Geographics that date back to the 1940s.\nInterior designers buy her books to decorate homes.\nHobbyists buy the books to make into other things to put on the walls. Wade said there used to be two long walls with thousands of old hardback Readers Digest books. Now, there is only a small wall left with maybe a hundred or so of old Readers Digests because of so many crafty people. But thousands and thousands of other books, new and used, remain on just about any topic imaginable.\nPeople who have never visited Snooper\u2019s Barn have come into the store because of the mural, she added. But the mural has also helped attract customers who have not been there in a long time.\nWhat they\u2019ll find is a store that still does business the old-fashioned way. There are no debit card or credit card machines and no computers at Snooper\u2019s Barn. There are nearby banks, however, with cash machines for those without folding money.\nWade said there has been a Snooper\u2019s Barn Used Books in Fort Smith for more than 50 years. At one time, there were two Snooper\u2019s Barn stores on Garrison Avenue but at some point prior to the Wades purchasing the business in April 2000, the stores were consolidated into the one store at 208 Towson Ave. Richard Wade passed away in September 2000, only a few months after the couple bought the business. The Wades moved from Kansas City, Missouri, in the 1970s and worked for Mid-America Industries. While they moved away for awhile, they kept their property here and moved back to Fort Smith and bought Snooper\u2019s Barn from Larry Brandenburg.\nFort Smith area book hounds who know Snooper\u2019s Barn from their childhood days often take comfort knowing the store is still around, Wade said. And they\u2019re introducing their children to some of the same magic they felt when their parents brought them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a generational thing, and that\u2019s nice to see,\u201d Wade said.\nOlder customers also have stories about what the building used to hold.\nThe two-story building that is occupied by Snooper\u2019s Barn on Towson was built in 1920 as a furniture store with a side room for medical equipment, Wade said. Upstairs, during World War II, a big band dance hall emerged for soldiers, she added.

Pacific\u2019s 3-2 victory over the Waves on Saturday at Klein Family Field was its first West Coast Conference home victory of the season and it has a chance to claim its first WCC series win of the season today beginning at 1 p.m.\nDefeating Pepperdine, the WCC runner-up last season to Gonzaga, was a quality win considering it\u2019d already posted series wins over Gonzaga and San Diego and had won eight of their last nine games entering Saturday.\n\u201cOur pitching picked it up and we played a clean game defensively,\u201d said Pacific coach Ryan Garko, whose Tigers posted no errors after committing three on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile; we\u2019ve been really scuffing in the field, but the guys haven\u2019t quit.

After singles by Jekich and Kevin Sandri, Keaton Glover was hit by a pitch on a full count. That produced a dream matchup with standout Free up to bat, but Free hit a slow roller to third and was narrowly thrown out at first.\nIn the third inning, Pepperdine\u2019s Matt Kanfer roughed up Pacific starter Hayden Pearce by tripling to deep right field past a diving Tyler Ryan. Kanfer immediately scored on a Billy Cook single for a 2-0 lead.\nThe Tigers rallied again in the fourth inning as sophomore Alex LeForestier, who has reached base in nine consecutive games, opened with a single. That was followed by Ryan\u2019s line double off the glove of the third baseman to deep left field. With both in scoring position, Carter Hayes put Pacific on the scoreboard with a groundout to second, enabling LeForestier to score.\nFreshman James Arakawa laid down a perfect bunt on a squeeze play that looked doomed from the start. Pepperdine first baseman Cook read the play and was in position to field Arakawa\u2019s bunt, but he booted the play as the ball went under his glove. Ryan\u2019s run tied the game at 2-2 with one out. The rally ended as Jekich struck out and Wyatt Hoffman grounded out to pitcher.\nIn the sixth inning Sweany relieved Pearce, who allowed two runs on four hits, four strikeouts and no walks.

That allows them to collect far more in fees for service than they spend on premiums.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently examined the practice at dialysis clinics and found that it could hurt a patient\u2019s readiness for kidney transplants, expose them to greater out-of-pocket costs and disrupt coverage if the dialysis center stopped paying premiums.\nThat\u2019s also a prevalent practice in California\u2019s addiction treatment industry, an investigation by the Southern California News Group found.\nLevya\u2019s bill would require financially interested third-parties to tell the patients \u2013 and the health plans \u2013 that they\u2019ll be paying premiums.

Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, would require the state to adopt the American Society of Addiction Medicine\u2019s treatment criteria as the minimum standard of care. That means medical management with drugs that block opioid cravings, like buprenorphine, methadone or naltrexone.\nThe overwhelming majority of California treatment centers are non-medical, based instead on the 12-step model of Alcoholics Anonymous. Some treatment centers and sober living homes refuse to accept clients who take medication, adhering to a completely drug-free philosophy that works less than 10 percent of the time.\nThe state Department of Finance is opposed to the CSAM approach, arguing that it would increase costs and limit flexibility for counties.\nKan heartily disagrees. \u201cThe state saves a tremendous amount by not having ER visits, hospitalizations, overdoses, HIV and hepatitis C infections, and deaths \u2013 not to mention involvement with the criminal justice system,\u201d Kan said.\nSeveral other bills on the governor\u2019s desk seek to refine physician training for prescribing opioids, and to specify how data kept in CURES \u2013 the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, which monitors prescription and dispensing of controlled substances \u2013 can be accessed and used.\nAlso waiting is AB 3162, by Assemblymembers Laura Friedman, D-Glendale, Melissa Melendez, R-Lake Elsinore, Quirk-Silva, D-Fullerton, and Sen.

Nevertheless, movements such as France\u2019s Front National and Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland will have new sticks with which to beat their nationalist drums.\nThat said, if the deal is finalised, there will be important economic and financial benefits.\nSet against that, borders would no longer need to be erected in the Schengen Area. Such a scenario would gum up trade and tourism. The cost of that could be 100 billion euros a year by 2025, according to analysis by the French government. And, eventually, Syrian refugees could play a valuable role in the economies of the countries where they settle\u2014although it remains to be seen how well those who come will integrate in their new homes."}

When Master Chief Petty Officer Kenneth Megan, then the assistant director of the U.S. Coast Guard Band, coordinated the first tour of an American military band in the former Soviet Union in June 1989, no one knew how the interaction would unfold. As it turns out, the Russians were just as curious about the visiting Americans, and the Coast Guard Band was met with warmth and kindness.\nCapt. Kenneth Megan, the U.S. Coast Guard Band\u2019s outgoing director. U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard Brahm.\nAnd so is the legacy the Coast Guard Band has created around the globe.\nMegan ultimately went on to serve as director, and one of his most memorable trips was to Japan in 2008 when the group represented the United States as the first premier American military band to perform a concert tour throughout Japan. There, they celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Japan Coast Guard and the 20th anniversary of the Japan Coast Guard Band; the U.S. Coast Guard Band was again welcomed with friendliness by the Japanese people.\n\u201cThe members of the band are such great goodwill ambassadors for the Coast Guard and the nation,\u201d said Megan.\nThough composed of only about 55 musicians and stationed permanently at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., the band\u2019s compelling music has also gained an impressive international audience through public radio broadcasts, an initiative Megan lead and continued to build upon. In the mid-80s, the band\u2019s performances began airing on more than 100 National Public Radio stations throughout the United States, which soon expanded to public radio stations in countries such as Japan, Australia, Great Britain and Germany. No longer was the band playing for an audience of just 1,500 people in Leamy Hall on the Academy grounds, but for tens of thousands of people across the world.\nAs he reflected upon his nine years as the band\u2019s director, Megan reminisced about the emotions he\u2019s experienced during the band\u2019s many engagements.

I like these things because, depending, they\u2019re safe, silly or sagacious but you don\u2019t necessarily know which until you look closer about a year later. It\u2019s a little like reading an eye chart.\nDavid Carr, the Media Equations columnist for The New York Times, picked a bunch of executives and companies he thinks will have difficult years in 2015, which included a lot of old media types, and Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer, who was so thoroughly shredded in the Times\u2019 Sunday magazine a couple weeks ago. He also said something less than flattering about Netflix, which is an attitude you don\u2019t see on display very much in big media.\nI\u2019ve been looking at five predictions for 2015 from Chris Knowlton, vice president and video streaming evangelist (an official title) for Wowza Media Systems, who has some eye-opening observations published by TechZone360.com. They aren\u2019t the showiest ones, but they\u2019re substantial enough to think about.\nFirst of all, he says, \u201cContent owners will bypass distributors\u201d which is already happening but he says, likely to accelerate. While Knowlton points to HBO\u2019s new online service, coming next year, and CBS All Access, he could have noted such direct-to-consumer experiments like Louis CK\u2019s videos, and just last week, the emergence of \u201cThe Interview\u201d as a downloadable event. That was unplanned, apparently, but it must give inspiration to lots of filmmakers (and studios with movies that may only satisfy niche audiences) to try that again and again. It was downloaded two million times and made $15 million from various online platforms since last Wednesday, AppleInsider.com reports. It was also illegally downloaded almost as much, says Business Insider.com. Fix that and you've got a business. The whole Cineplex experience thing was wavering even before Sony began pretend-killing dictators; this will just speed it along. And it makes sense. Less than a decade ago, \u201cmovie stars\u201d only made movies. Now, they mostly do voice-overs for cartoons.\nKnowlton also predicts more live-event streaming, which is pretty standard-issue crystal ball gazing. So is his prediction that mobile video consumption will increase, and that\u2019s on a lot of lists. I don\u2019t doubt it, but I wonder where that ends. Knowlton suggests businesses will start using mobile platforms for employee communications and sales calls. But unless a lot of premium content--with a higher bar to be called \u201cpremium\u201d--develops, I still can\u2019t get my arms around mobile video that is used for much more than viewing-while-in-transit. And no doubt, I\u2019m just dead wrong.\nAnother Knowlton prediction seems intriguing. Online video for distance learning has been around for awhile, but now, Knowlton says, \u201c \u2018Flipped classroom\u2019 experiences allow teachers to assign lecture videos for students to watch on their own time, allowing them to spend more quality group and individual time with students in the classroom.\u201d That's a movement already in progress.\nThat seems so utterly practical and expandable, you could imagine a time when the concept is more the norm than the exception, which will either be disastrous or a triumph.

To add insult to injury, the company also stopped paying a dividend altogether.\nIt&apos;s clear which of these stocks has been the better investment thus far, but a question for investors new to the scene is this: Which of these stocks is the better buy now?\nA success or a risk?\nVerizon isn&apos;t anything close to a turnaround story -- it&apos;s a hugely successful telecommunications player with strong positions in both wireless networks as well as in wireline.\nAfter turning in decent results for 2018 -- revenue was up 1.4% to $108.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) hit $4.71, up from $3.74 in the prior year -- the company forecasts 2019 revenue to grow at a \"low single-digit percentage\" rate and for EPS, less the impact of a new accounting standard, to be \"similar to 2018 adjusted EPS.\"\nVerizon isn&apos;t promising investors significant growth (so don&apos;t expect the shares to generate large returns in a short period of time), but the business should continue to crank out massive amounts of cash to sustain its large dividend (the stock currently offers a dividend yield of 4.43%) for the foreseeable future.\nFrontier Communications, on the other hand, doesn&apos;t offer that kind of safety at all. Last quarter, the company saw revenue drop nearly 5.6% year over year, and it reported a net loss on a non-GAAP basis (which excludes, among other things, a $400 million goodwill impairment) of $7 million, or $0.07 per share.\nWhile that loss isn&apos;t great, what I think is more concerning is that Frontier&apos;s business is on the decline, and the company had about $1 billion worth of long-term debt coming due within the next year.

The late crop will continue until the rain starts in fall.\nDear Alan: I love raspberries and have noticed that much of the year they come from Mexico. What is the best time for local raspberries?\nAlan: Raspberries are one of the most delicious, and fragile, fruits that we find in the market.\nThe first summertime basket of bright, aromatic raspberries on my kitchen counter is an invitation to put them in a bowl, sprinkle lightly with sugar and drizzle with good, thick cream.\nAs you mentioned, more and more raspberries are being imported from Mexico, Chile and even New Zealand in our winter months. These berries must be picked before they reach perfect ripeness, and are never as good as fresh, local berries.\nThere are at least 100 varieties of raspberries available to local commercial growers and home gardeners. Most shoppers are familiar with red raspberries, but they also come in delicious colors of black, yellow, gold, apricot and purple.\nSome of the best local red raspberries have a small crop in early summer, but their main crop starts in mid-August. This late crop continues until the first big rains of fall.\nRight now, I like to combine raspberries in desserts with late summer nectarines and peaches. The tart flavor of the berries really accentuates the sweetness of the stone fruits.\nI can\u2019t imagine wasting an August without crisp and cobbler combining raspberries and nectarines. And I always make a fresh version of Peach Melba; vanilla ice cream smothered with sliced peaches, raspberries and raspberry sauce.\nFor a wintertime treat, you can preserve raspberries in brandy. Fold the preserved berries into chocolate desserts, spoon over ice cream, or use in a sauce.\nTo make, fill a quart jar with raspberries. Add 1 cup of sugar and cover with brandy or Cognac. Close the jar and let it sit for four days. Shake the jar during this time to make sure sugar is dissolved. These will keep until next raspberry season!\nBecause they are so fragile, most local raspberries are sold in the nearly-ubiquitous plastic \u201cclamshell\u201d with the little absorbent pad in the bottom. These hold about 1-1/2 cups of fruit.\nSome raspberries, especially at farmers markets, may be in shallow cardboard baskets. Don\u2019t buy those that are stained with the juice of crushed berries.\nChoose berries that look velvety and plump. Check carefully for mold, which often starts growing in the stem cavity and may be hard to detect.\nOne moldy berry can ruin the flavor of a bowlful.\nDon\u2019t try to store raspberries for very long. As soon as you get them home, open the basket and carefully pour out the berries onto a shallow pan lined with paper towels. Remove any stray stems or leaves.\nRefrigerate or freeze right away. Frozen berries should be bagged airtight.\nI never wash raspberries before use. I only buy those that have never been sprayed. If you must, give them a quick rinse in a colander under a stream of cold water.\nFresh raspberry sauce is an easy and quick garnish for ice cream, summer fruits and cakes.

The key may lie in how brain cells regulate their intake of calcium.\n\"Normally, calcium in brain cells does wonderful things, including forming memories,\" says Park, professor of biological sciences at Chicago. \"But too much calcium makes things go haywire,\" he adds, the journal Public Library of Science ONE reports.\nBrain cells starved of oxygen can't regulate calcium entry, and too much calcium in the cell is lethal. When a heart attack or stroke prevents oxygenated blood from reaching the brain, brain damage or death results, according to a Chicago statement.\nNaked mole-rats, however, are very tolerant to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia - as are human newborns, whose brain cells have calcium channels that close during oxygen deprivation, protecting the cells from calcium overdose. With age, these calcium channels no longer close, which normally isn't a problem -- except during a heart attack.\nNaked mole-rats retain a tolerance for oxygen deprivation into adulthood. Park and his colleagues measured calcium entry in brain tissue that had been kept under oxygen-poor conditions.\nPark thinks this strategy is an evolutionary adaptation by mole-rats, which live in the hundreds underground in tight, oxygen-deprived conditions. \"Imagine 200 mice living in a shoe box buried four feet under the ground - things are going to get bad fast,\" he said.\nThe researchers think they have identified a novel mechanism for protecting the adult brain in times of oxygen deprivation.\nPark, who for years has studied naked mole-rats and their unusual adaptations, thinks the latest findings \"are just the tip of the iceberg\" of what we can learn from the rodents.\nTheir homes are not only oxygen-poor, but rich in carbon dioxide and ammonia -- conditions that would make most animals ill. Yet mole-rats have evolved to suppress pain and even cancer.\nEat Well Otherwise the Brain Will Start Eating Itself!\nStarvation dieting can trigger auto-cannibalism in the Brain, reports an article in Cell Metabolism.\nDoes Oxygen Actually Help Patients Who Suffer a Heart Attack?\nInhalation of oxygen has been a part of the initial management of people suffering from a heart attack.

By dusk they had disappeared, and only a few lightly armed militiamen guarded key intersections.\nIncreasing numbers of young and middle-aged men in military haircuts could be seen lounging around in casual civilian clothes -- as if they had just stashed their uniforms in a closet somewhere.\nThe Ministry of Information, which has acted as Hussein's mouthpiece, also seemed to vanish. State television, with its stock footage of Hussein reviewing troops and waving to crowds, was knocked off the air after U.S. troops based at a presidential palace attacked the ministry and broadcast center.

For years, it seems, beaujolais has been struggling against its bright bubblegum-and-banana \"nouveau\" image. Few seemingly touch it for the rest of the year.\nThere was some bizarre advertising campaign a while back with animals that presumably represented the different crus (the French really can be quite silly) but maybe the answer is the nickname that the Discover Beaujolais promotional campaign has chosen to use on Twitter: bojo.\nIt's an accessible, memorable name for an appealing, versatile wine that many would enjoy just as much as ros\u00e9 if they gave it a chance. It's made, as you may know, from gamay, which has less of a reputation than the more glamorous pinot noir that features in the rest of the Burgundy region, but is capable of producing highly drinkable wines at a fraction of the cost.\nIn general I'd suggest going for beaujolais villages rather than basic beaujolais, though there's nothing wrong with Waitrose's attractively fruity Beaujolais from the excellent 2011 vintage (12.5%, \u00a36.69). Alcohol is a better guide to quality: I'd generally go for 12.5% rather than 12%. Other good own-brand bojos are Tesco's 2013 Beaujolais Villages (12.5%, \u00a36.79) and Asda's 2012 Extra Special Beaujolais-Villages (12.5%, \u00a36.50). All would benefit from being served lightly chilled.\nThe \"crus\" that are named after individual villages offer more complexity and ageing potential. (Yes, beaujolais does age.) It's hard to generalise because invididual wines also reflect the winemaker and vintage but Fleurie and Chiroubles, for instance, are lighter and more floral, Morgon and Moulin-\u00e0-vent fuller and more structured. It would be worth tucking away a few bottles of 2013 Ch\u00e2teau de Pizay Morgon (13%, on offer at Majestic at \u00a38.99 if you buy two) to enjoy with roast pork in a couple of years time.\nIf you want to see what beaujolais is capable of, try the sublime Julien Sunier Fleurie 2011 (12.5%, \u00a319.50 at Berry Bros), a wine in which you can almost smell warm earth and wild flowers.

It was an early 11 a.m. tip-off as DePaul welcomed nearly 1,700 energetic and rowdy Chicago Public School children to McGrath-Phillips Arena for DePaul\u2019s annual \u201cField Trip Day\u201d.\nSenior guard Ashton Millender tied her career-high in 3-point field goals made in a single game with seven of them en route to scoring a game-high 23 points. Rebekah Dahlman, a sixth-year senior, posted 16 points, all of which came in the second half. Both players also pulled down five rebounds and four assists apiece.\nFreshman guard Lexi Held, who was named as the Big East freshman of the week on Monday, had an efficient day dropping 13 points on five-of-six shooting and she also made all three of her 3-point attempts. Kelly Campbell nearly had a triple double scoring nine points, while dishing out nine assists and getting eight rebounds.\nAs a team, DePaul shot 46.3 percent from the field and knocked down 18 total 3-pointers, good for just under 41 percent from deep.\nDePaul opened the game with back to back 3-point field goals from Millender and Chante Stonewall in the first 1:18 of the game to open up on an 8-0 run. However, Temple climbed back into the game after shooting five-of-six from the field which kept the game close with DePaul leading by just three points at 16-13 with just under four minutes left in the first quarter.\nOnce halftime rolled around, the Blue Demons led 49-36 on a crisp 40.9 percent shooting mark. Out of DePaul\u2019s 18 first half field goals made, 11 of them came from behind the arc. With a tight man-to-man defensive strategy, DePaul forced Temple into committing 13 turnovers during that time period. As a result, DePaul scored 18 points off those turnovers to make up for inconsistent ball movement against Temple\u2019s length. Not to mention, Dahlman\u2019s game elevated to a different level.\nIt wasn\u2019t just about Millender and Dahlman however, as Stonewall also put up 15 points. Mart\u2019e Grays finished with 10 points and six rebounds while Tanita Allen scored 13 points and got seven rebounds off the bench.\nDespite some early struggles with moving the ball, DePaul started sharing the ball more often in the third quarter and had eight assists in total during that period in comparison to 12 assists in the entire first half. Consequently, DePaul blew the game open in the third quarter opening up an 81-65 lead heading into the fourth quarter when they put up 32 points while converting 57.1 percent of its field goal attempts and knocking down four 3-point baskets.\nEven with DePaul\u2019s offensive spurt, Temple did not back down and opened the fourth quarter on a 17-12 run to cut DePaul\u2019s lead down to 93-82 in the quarter\u2019s opening minutes. That run was made possible by Temple shooting six-of-ten from the field.\nTemple continued its hot shooting streak"}

The increasing popularity of this fishing village led to its incorporation as a municipality in 1984. The tourism industry, attracted by Destin's fine, white sands and warm Gulf Coast waters, has been booming ever since. A handful of local motels offer direct access to the beaches.\nOn the eastern end of the Destin coast, Sea Oats Motel is the ideal getaway spot. The large building seems to grow out of the white sands that surround it. Rooms facing the water have balconies, and you can step directly from the lower floor onto the sand. Sea Oats rents umbrellas and beach chairs so that visitors can better enjoy their sun and sand experience. You can also take a dip in the motel's heated swimming pool.\nJust over a mile west of Sea Oats Motel is the charming Beachside Inn at Crystal Beach. It's just across the street from the beach and makes up for its relative distance from downtown Destin -- the nearest shops are about a mile away -- by hosting restaurants that serve seafood, sushi and coffee on top of the standard cafe fare. If you're worried about Fido, some of the rooms at the inn also welcome pets.\nJust a few blocks to the west and north of Sea Oats Motel, Old Pier Motel & Apartments is a two-minute walk from the beach. What Old Pier Motel lacks in ocean proximity, however, it makes up for with affordable rates and a surprising range of options for travelers, including larger rentals that can sleep a family of up to five people. The amenities on-site are low-tech, but apartment rentals have roomy kitchens with everything you'll need to whip up a picnic for the beach.\nThough the local Holiday Inn Express is set back from the water, a bit beyond Beachside Inn, it's still a very short and pleasant walk to the waters of the Gulf. The sprawling Henderson Beach State Park is also within a mile of the hotel. Holiday Inn Express also contains a 24/7 business center and is near the Emerald Coast Conference Center, so it may be the perfect place to mix a little work with play while you're in Destin.\nDuke, Caitlin. \"Beachfront Motels in Destin, Florida.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/beachfront-motels-destin-florida-111103.html.

The difference between male and female pay is closing, but clearly not very quickly.\nEmployee review firm Glassdoor has released its Progress on the Gender Pay Gap: 2019 report, from a survey conducted by its Glassdoor Economic Research. It includes results on gender pay differences for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The gender pay gap in the United States is $0.79 for women compared to a dollar for men. It was the smallest in France at $0.88 per dollar, and the largest at $0.78 in Germany.\nThe comparison between men and women varies significantly by job. Glassdoor looked at 15 professions. The gap was largest among pilots, where men make 26.6% more than women, and among chefs, where men make 24.6% more. These numbers vary geographically as well, based on an analysis of the worst-paying states for women.\nIndustries where men make more than women include media, where the difference is 6.4%, and retail, where they have the same advantage. Another analysis was recently made in a study of the 25 highest paying jobs for women.\nNot all the differences in pay can be explained. Glassdoor puts factors into two categories, which are those that can be explained and those that cannot. Those that can be explained, such as age and education, make up 64% of the difference.

While North Dakota&apos;s Public Service Commission has touted its hiring of Carson to help supplement inspections by the Federal Railroad Administration, some have questioned the panel&apos;s rationale for hiring an industry insider.\n\"He may have the best intentions but it does look odd,\" said Wayde Schafer, a spokesman for the North Dakota chapter of the Sierra Club. \"It&apos;d be like if they hired me.\"\nCarson did not return messages left for him at the PSC.\nThe state rail safety program had been a campaign platform for Republican Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak when she ran for the position last year.

Tyler Axness, a Fargo Democrat, was the first to propose the rail safety program in his failed bid against Fedorchak for a PSC seat in November. The aim was to help prevent oil train accidents like the 2013 crash in Casselton that left an ominous cloud over the city and led some residents to evacuate. That train was run by BNSF, which also had a fiery oil train derailment in May in the tiny North Dakota community of Heimdal, forcing residents to evacuate from their homes for about a day.\nThe rail safety program was hotly debated during the last legislative session, with Republicans saying it&apos;s not needed and that it duplicates the federal government&apos;s efforts.\nDemocrats blasted the move, calling it a broken promise. In the end, lawmakers funded the program that included two rail safety inspectors.\nAxness has pushed for even more inspectors, though he questioned hiring those linked to railroads they will regulate.\n\"This isn&apos;t necessarily the first time somebody close to industry has been hired to oversee industry,\" he said. \"I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a pattern we should be concerned about.\"\nDon Morrison, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said it is a pattern that is worrisome.

Alas, I, who am a registered but not sworn Democrat and have been that for more than half a century, certainly cannot vouch that the party will long stand up for one of the few vigorous democracies on Earth.\nMore than 16 years ago, Ehud Barak, an authentic hero including at Entebbe, crafted a peace plan that won the approval of Bill Clinton and should have won, with the usual habits of give-and-take diplomacy, at least the assent of the Palestinians to further talks. Barak ultimately agreed to give up all of Gaza, which Ariel Sharon later did, as well as 95 percent of the rest of the disputed territory, with special geographical, political, and religious arrangements for Jerusalem. Eight years later, Ehud Olmert\u2014now in jail\u2014added another 3 percent to the Israeli offer and allowed for what would now be Arab Jerusalem to be the capital of Palestine. No takers. Those facts, if you want to look, tell you plenty.\nThose facts didn\u2019t tell President Obama much, or he didn\u2019t look. I supported Obama in his first campaign for president \u2026 against Hillary Clinton and against George Bush. I even went south to Florida to campaign for him and stayed there a crowded week. My contact with the bigger effort was Dan Shapiro (later to become the candidate\u2019s ambassador to Israel), who first asked me to go. I\u2019d also met with Obama: once before he entered the race and once\u2014this time in a group\u2014at the beginning of the primaries.\nObama seemed at the time, and turned out to be, a reasonable, well-intentioned man. But he was a catastrophe on international affairs. His one triumph was something he didn\u2019t have anything to do with: He won the Nobel Peace Prize, and, actually, maybe this ended up mattering more than anything else. The Peace Prize came less than a year into his first term: In desperate explanation for the choice, the prize committee\u2019s PR fingered Obama\u2019s opening to the Muslim world for special recognition. And so Obama was operating with what he thought was a promise to live up to\u2014a promise no one could live up to against the fractured history of the Middle East.

{"idx": "4151", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: April 15, 2011: To better track PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and other long term effects of combat (concussion, as well as muscle and skeletal problems), the U.S. Army began studying the medical records of millions of current, former and retired troops. After interviewing some of the older troops, it found that there was indeed more long term medical problems for those exposed to explosions during combat, and those who went through lots of strenuous military training. But the researchers also found long term health problems in unexpected areas. It was discovered, for example, that most helicopter pilots eventually develop back pain. Further examination revealed the cause. Helicopter pilots, despite working while sitting down, wear a lot more gear than most air force pilots, and work in a non-air conditioned environment, while often sitting forward and at an uncomfortable angle. Their seats, while appearing comfortable, are not as comfy as you might think, especially for a pilot wearing a protective vest and carrying lots of other emergency gear (in case the chopper goes down and a quick exit is required). Few pilots reported the back pain, which got worse with age.\nPiloting helicopters only became a major military activity in the 1960s, and that first generation of pilots are now reaching the age where old sports injuries are becoming very uncomfortable. The army has found that the back pain for older helicopter pilots was not all sports related (although the early crop of chopper pilots tended to be athletes in school.) Now the army is learning a lot more about long term injuries, and the resulting chronic pain issues.\nThe army has been learning similar lessons since the 1970s, as a lot more women joined the military. Some of these lessons were learned via the experience of other nations and services. Unlike the U.S. Army, the British and the U.S. Marines decided that lower levels of physical fitness for women soldiers was not acceptable and, since 1998, the British women have had to meet the same high standards for physical fitness as the men. Since then, the army has learned the same thing the coaches of the increasingly popular women's sports program have; women are more prone to \"overuse\" injury. In some sports (like basketball) women have ten times the number of certain types of injuries (knees) as men. In the British army, even before the more vigorous training program for women, the percentage of male recruits lost because of \"overuse injury\" was 1.5 percent, versus 4.6 percent for women. The new training program, which does get the women in shape, also puts 11.1 percent of the recruits out of the service because of injuries. The basic problem is that less muscle mass and lower bone density puts 39 percent more stress on women during vigorous physical training. The army found that some of these injuries could be greatly reduced if the physical training for women was done over a six month period, rather than the current three month course men and women are using. But the injury rates will probably always be higher because of the fundamental gender differences.\nAll these discoveries will cost the military a lot of money, but it's best to be the first to announce the problem. Sports medicine in general has become more accurate and predictive, and a lot of late-life medical problems can be traced to seemingly healed injuries back when the victim was an adolescent or young adult. A lot of these injuries can be avoided by redesigning equipment, and limiting how much is worn when troops are in foot. Such limits are not always possible, so a lot of former infantrymen are going to qualify for treatment of injuries acquired when they were in their 2"}

Together, these clashes helped bring the country\u2019s banking industry to the brink of collapse, prompting European finance ministers in June to devise an emergency \u20ac100 billion, or $123.4 billion, rescue plan for the sector.\nIn the years before the real estate collapse, Mr. Gayoso and his caja, Caixanova, financed Vigo\u2019s first university campus. They built or acquired some of the grandest buildings along the city\u2019s main thoroughfare. And through Caixanova, Mr. Gayoso became a leading patron of the arts, assembling an impressive painting collection hung at various cultural centers sponsored by the bank.\n\u201cThis is a workers\u2019 city, but even our Communist painters got so many commissions from him that they portrayed him as a god,\u201d said Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Pr\u00edncipe, a former mayor of Vigo.\nMr. Gayoso resigned just days after investigators filed suit against him and four other board members, accusing the executives of surreptitiously setting up multimillion-euro retirement plans for themselves after the 2010 merger between Mr. Gayoso\u2019s caja and another savings bank in the Galicia region.\nThe merged institution, Novacaixagalicia, was Spain\u2019s fifth-largest savings bank, with about 8,000 employees, almost three million clients and annual revenue of \u20ac124 billion.\nLast year, the state took control of Novacaixagalicia and pumped in \u20ac2.5 billion of capital to offset the bank\u2019s burgeoning portfolio of problem loans.\nMr. Gayoso declined to be interviewed for this article. But in recent testimony before the Spanish Parliament, he denied responsibility for the bank\u2019s collapse. He described his chairmanship as an institutional position that was limited to making proposals to the board.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take a single personal decision, because I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he told lawmakers.\nMr. Gayoso\u2019s portrayal of his chairmanship is contradicted by some former board members.

We spoke about custody matters where one parent has converted and the other has not,\" Dr Wan Salim said on Monday, after the meeting.\n\"There should be a common platform to discuss which is the relevant law in cases like this and which law should be improved.\"\nHe said the meeting was aimed at eliminating confusion and misunderstanding between the Muslim and Christian communities.\n\"If it is of public interest and it is for something just and fair, the Islamic faith gives its blessings,\" Dr Wan Salim added.\nBishop Sebastian said he was impressed with the outcome of the meeting and commended Dr Wan Salim's commitment to ensuring that justice, peace and mercy continued to be upheld.\n\"We are here to build bridges between both faiths. There are many things that we agree on and there are many issues which need to be tackled as well.

Plenty of viewers have been asking how we made it.\nBoth YouTube and Facebook now support 360-degree, panoramic video. Mobile device users can swing the phone about their body, examining the scene from any angle. On a desktop, a user can click and drag inside the video, swinging the field-of-view back and forth, up and down. In Google Cardboard (or a similar headset), a user can move their head naturally, looking around a scene as though their head were somehow levitating within it.\nWe're not used to seeing the person holding the camera in video footage, but in spherical video it's unavoidable. The New York Times video \"The Displaced\" avoids exposing the camera handler through careful staging and postproduction edits to remove the filmmaker's gear. We decided to include ourselves and our equipment in the final cut of our video, as we were curious how this kind of transparency can serve journalists operating on a short schedule and with minimal technical overhead. Showing reporters and equipment isn't as \"polished,\" but editing the cameraperson and gear out of a shot to create the illusion of an autonomous camera can be deceptive. Let us know what you think!\nWatching 360-degree video feels a little like being inside a video. Though a user can't see their own body, the sense of a \"viewpoint\" is very strong. Physical sensations like vertigo are much stronger than they would be in flat video. This idea is often presented as cautionary advice to a would-be 360-degree filmmaker who doesn't want to disorient his or her audience. But it also suggests the importance of perspective in spherical video.\nWe decided to ditch the tripod for this piece. Handheld shots are less steady, but they also convey the reality of the situation being filmed. Think about a chase scene where the camera operator is holding the camera while running. The back-and-forth motion of the camera conveys the experience of running more viscerally, even if the surrounding scene is more difficult to see.\nIn contrast, a camera on a tripod provides a very still shot, detached from the action surrounding it. Even if a viewer is visually surrounded by action in a 360-degree video, there's a sense of detachment that detracts from the physical immersion experience, and the viewer feels like a spectator. In 360-degree video, the viewer's perspective depends on where the camera is situated. We asked Pat Hand, whom we interviewed about the loss of her home in the fire, to carry the camera and guide the viewer. We were curious about how being \"held\" by a subject, rather than a tripod or a camera operator, would change a viewer's experience. Would it feel more like they were standing beside her rather than anonymously observing her? Would the movement of the camera feel distracting, or add a sense of intimacy?\nWe, the production team, also appear in the footage. This was a deliberate decision: We think that our appearance in the video adds to the immersive qualities of 360-degree storytelling. Conventional documentary film protocol keeps the production team and the reporter out of the video frame. Everybody hides behind the camera. With 360-degree video, there is nowhere to hide. Our presence also adds an element of transparency to the project and adds to the immersive experience. We want the"}

The event it covers happened on February 2nd of 2018, as part of SAIL\u2019s regular AI Salon discussion series. Look forward to more blog posts on new AI Salon events soon!\nEarlier this month, I had the exciting opportunity to moderate a discussion between Professors Yann LeCun and Christopher Manning, titled \u201cWhat innate priors should we build into the architecture of deep learning systems?\u201d The event was a special installment of AI Salon, a discussion series held within the Stanford AI Lab that often features expert guests.\nThis discussion topic \u2013 about the structural design decisions we build into our neural architectures, and how those correspond to certain assumptions and inductive biases \u2013 is an important one in AI right now. In fact, last year I highlighted \u201cthe return of linguistic structure\u201d as one of the top four NLP Deep Learning research trends of 2017.\nOn one side, Manning is a prominent advocate for incorporating more linguistic structure into deep learning systems. On the other, LeCun is a leading proponent for the ability of simple but powerful neural architectures to perform sophisticated tasks without extensive task-specific feature engineering. For this reason, anticipation for disagreement between the two was high, with one Twitter commentator describing the event as \u201cthe AI equivalent of Batman vs Superman\u201d.\nHowever, LeCun and Manning agreed on more than you may expect. LeCun\u2019s most famous contribution (the Convolutional Neural Network) is all about an innate prior \u2013 the assumption that an image processing system should be translationally invariant \u2013 which is enforced through an architectural design choice (weight sharing). For his part, Manning has spoken publicly to say that the Deep Learning renaissance is A Good Thing for NLP.\nWhile the two professors agreed on many other things during the discussion, certain key differences emerged \u2013 you can watch the full video above. The rest of this post is a summary of the main themes that emerged throughout the discussion, plus some links to relevant further materials.\nStructure: a necessary good or a necessary evil?\nIn their opening statements, Manning and LeCun quickly established their main difference of opinion.\nManning described structure as a \u201cnecessary good\u201d (9:14), arguing that we should have a positive attitude towards structure as a good design decision. In particular, structure allows us to design systems that can learn more from less data, and at a higher level of abstraction, compared to those without structure.\nConversely, LeCun described structure as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d (2:44), and warned that imposing structure requires us to make certain assumptions, which are invariably wrong for at least some portion of the data, and may become obsolete within the near future. As an example, he hypothesized that ConvNets may be obsolete in 10 years (29:57).\nDespite this disagreement, we should note that LeCun and Manning did at least agree that structure is \u201cnecessary\u201d \u2013 they just have different attitudes towards that necessity.\nManning views it as the right and principled thing to do \u2013 for example, language is fundamentally recursive, so NLP architectures should be too (23:40)! He did acknowledge, however, that in practice it\u2019s difficult to make the correct structural assumptions, and those assumptions don\u2019t always translate to comprehensive performance gains (see for example, the mixed success of the Recursive Neural Network, aka Tree-RNN, which imposes recursive compositionality as an innate prior).\nLe"}

Whatever it is, that determines your contentment in life.\nThe Apostle Paul gives us the command to \u201cDo all things without grumbling or disputing\u201d (Phil 2:14), in order \u201cthat you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world\u201d (Phil 2:15), but why would Paul tie in our contentment with being blameless or innocent before God? Maybe it\u2019s because when we grumble about things, we\u2019re actually grumbling against God. If anyone had a reason to grumble, it would have been Paul. Paul was stoned, beaten, whipped, imprisoned, and faced hunger, thirst, cold, and heat. He had his life threatened several times, yet Paul\u2019s contentment was in Christ. Paul understood that we can choose to live in two tents in this life; the tent of discontentment or the tent of contentment, and one\u2019s a lot nicer to live in than the other. Paul had poured out his life as a drink offering (Phil 2:17), but there is no record anywhere in Scripture where Paul ever grumbled or complained about it. Near the end of his life, knowing he was about to pass into glory, he wrote, \u201cI am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith\u201d (2nd Tim 3:6-7). Paul didn\u2019t base his contentment upon circumstances or things, and good thing too because there were few good circumstances for Paul, but it didn\u2019t matter. His contentment was in Christ and not in circumstances.\nWhat have you ever grumbled about, even to yourself? The ancient Israelites certainly had short-term memory lapses because at one time, they were crying out in anguish under the harsh hand of the Egyptian taskmasters, but shortly after they were freed, they grumbled against Moses and Aaron. They were more interested in short-term gratification rather than long-term sanctification. We are at risk of the same thing if we don\u2019t think ahead to the coming Promised Land (Rev 21:1-4; 22). The nation of Israel wasn\u2019t living for the end of their journey but only living in the moment. That\u2019s why \u201cthe whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness\u201d (Ex 16:2), and said to Moses and Aaron, \u201cWould that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger\u201d (Ex 16:3). If God had not intervened more than once, Israel would have stoned Moses to death. Even Moses interceded on behalf of the ungrateful nation, so Moses didn\u2019t base his contentment on Israel\u2019s grumbling or being in the Wilderness, but on the preservation of God\u2019s chosen people. Moses was not living for instant gratification or short-term pleasures in this life because \u201cwhen he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward\u201d (Heb 11:24-"}

Good, because stepping away from your desk to peek at the sun through a pair of eclipse glasses could possibly have cost the U.S. workforce in diminished productivity. Or at least that\u2019s according to outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which used information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to predict a loss in worker productivity. Here\u2019s how the math breaks down: there are about 87 million U.S. workers, making an average hourly wage of $23.86. If they all took about 20 minutes to scout out a spot to see the eclipse and then watch the whole thing unfold, it would cost an employer $7.95 per person, or, when multiplied by 87 million, about $694 million in lost productivity.\nYour back-of-the-envelope mileage may vary. Challenger, Gray & Christmas got that number by assuming employees are already being productive every moment that they\u2019re at their desks in the early afternoon\u2014and not, for instance, browsing Facebook\u2014and that diversions like watching the eclipse are the only unproductive moments of an employee\u2019s day.

Seven hundred million sounds like a lot, but by its own accounting, the firm says the U.S. economy collectively lost $615 million from people setting their brackets during March Madness opening week; $1.7 billion per hour from people discussing the Super Bowl the following day; $1.9 billion per hour during Cyber Monday; $3.3 billion during James Comey\u2019s testimony earlier this summer; and $10 billion during Amazon Prime Day."}

It affects a person's energy levels and their ability to function in everyday life.\nThere are several types of bipolar disorder, the most widespread being bipolar I and bipolar II.\nIn this article, learn about the similarities and differences between bipolar I and bipolar II. We also consider their causes, symptoms, and the available treatment options.\nA person with bipolar disorder may experience extreme changes in mood.\nPeople with bipolar disorder experience abnormal highs or lows in mood. During a \"high,\" also known as a manic episode, people feel intense energy or excitement.\nDuring a \"low,\" or depressive episode, they experience symptoms of depression, such as sadness and hopelessness.\nA doctor can diagnose a person with one of the above types based on the duration and intensity of their symptoms.\nBipolar I and bipolar II are the most widespread forms of bipolar disorder. They are also the more severe of the bipolar disorders.\nBipolar I and II have similar symptoms and patterns in which symptoms occur. However, people who have bipolar II will experience less severe manic episodes than people with bipolar I. This type of mania is known as hypomania.\nTo receive a diagnosis of bipolar II, a person must also experience a major depressive episode , which does not apply in a diagnosis of bipolar I.\nA doctor can diagnose bipolar I based on the presence of a manic episode alone. People with bipolar I disorder have at least one manic episode that persists for a week or longer or severe mania that requires hospitalization.\nThose with bipolar II disorder do not generally require hospitalization during hypomanic periods. Doctors sometimes misdiagnose bipolar II as depression because the hypomanic symptoms can be very subtle.\nIn between these episodes of mania and depression, people who have either of these types of bipolar may experience periods of stable mood. It is also possible to have symptoms of depression and mania at the same time. This is known as bipolar with \"mixed features.\"\nThe main symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II are mania, hypomania, and depression.\nDuring a manic episode, a person may have an increased desire to drink alcohol.\nPeriods of mania can interfere with a person's daily activities and their relationships with others.\nSome people may be unable to achieve a calm state or to have rational thoughts during a manic episode.\nIn a state of hypomania, people experience symptoms similar to those in mania, except less severe.\nHypomania can still interfere with a person's quality of life, and family and friends may notice that the person is experiencing mood changes.\nDoctors consider these symptoms to be a depressive episode if they persist for 2 weeks or more.\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 2.8 percent of adults in the United States experience bipolar disorder in a given year. An estimated 4.4 percent of people experience bipolar at some point in their lives.\nThe condition affects men and women almost equally. Onset occurs at an average age of 25, but it can happen to people of any age.\nA psychiatrist can assess an individual to give a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\nTo receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, individuals will need to see a psychiat"}

He referred to the successful outcome of the recently concluded bilateral air services agreement, which would enable the commencement of the direct air links between Colombo and Kathmandu, and consequently expected the number of pilgrims travelling to Nepal to increase considerably.\nSpeaking further, the Minister said that the strong bilateral relations would receive a major impetus when President Rajapaksa undertakes an official visit to Nepal in early March, during which he will hold high level discussions with Nepali leaders.\nForeign Minister Bogollagama emphasized the need for closer collaboration between Nepal and Sri Lanka in the economic sphere, particularly to promote bilateral trade, investment and tourism. He noted that the two countries would be able to harness the synergies in their respective competencies towards enhancing bilateral cooperation. He also stated that Sri Lanka can cooperate with Nepal in the fields of health and education, and thanked the Government of Nepal for facilitating Sri Lankan students to pursue medical studies in Nepal. The Minister spoke of the strong professional expertise that Sri Lanka possesses in the hospitality industry, which could be availed of by Nepali students to help develop this sector in Nepal.\nReferring to the forthcoming SAARC Council of Ministers meeting in Colombo, the Minister highlighted two areas which would receive priority attention of the SAARC Foreign Ministers, namely the need to strengthen measures to combat terrorism and ways and means of minimizing the adverse impact of the current global financial crisis and the consequent economic downturn.

Warming is evident in the moistness of the air in this area of the world's driest continent.\n''Rain is now not uncommon and whilst this may encourage plant life, it is probably detrimental to the health of many breeding birds, which get damp and cold.\n''This moistness also results in more snow falling and this too can affect the breeding habits of nesting birds when it falls during their incubation period, burying their eggs in the cold snow.\n''At Peterman Island we saw penguins soaked by the rain, and this is a location where the more northern gentoo penguins are increasing in numbers at the expense of the Adelies [penguins], which are more suited to colder conditions.\n''The glaciers draining the ice caps of the islands and the mountains of the peninsula are shrinking too. This has resulted in the formation of more icebergs and a greater run-off of fresh water.\nExpedition leader Michael Aw said the team witnessed an increase in gelatinous herbivores called salps possibly at the expense of phytoplankton, which are consumed by fish and krill.\n''The balance in the herbivore elements of the food chain determines the types of larger animals that can be supported \u2026 there are suggestions it is changing from one that supports krill and its predators [seabirds, seals, whales] to one that may result in more fish and possibly squid,'' he said."}

In the title of her exhibition at Aceartinc., Montreal-based artist Fiona Annis quotes a persistent myth that harbours a kernel of truth: \"The stars are dead but their light lives on.\"\nTrue, the stars we can see with the naked eye are probably all still chugging along, but when they do blink out it will take years -- if not tens of thousands of years -- for their last gasps to register on Earth. Even light can only move so fast: if only on a human scale, our view of the night sky is still, in a very real sense, a look back in time.\nSimilarly, our most revealing pictures of the cosmos tell their truths in roundabout ways. Telescopes register wavelengths that the eye can't perceive, while composite, \"false-colour\" photographs help us discern the character and composition of galaxies and nebulae too vast, too complex and too distant to fathom any other way. Even the \"sounds\" of crackling solar wind and creaking comets must be adjusted to fit the range of human hearing.\nAnnis loses herself in these translations, reinterpreting astronomical data to craft alternate means of visualizing the universe. Her work is melancholic and lovely, lyrical and spare, spanning traditional photo processes, installation sculpture and sound. It invites us to contemplate the art, science and metaphors we use to help locate ourselves in \"deep\" time and space.\nTrue, the stars we can see with the naked eye are probably all still chugging along, but when they do blink out it will take years \u2014 if not tens of thousands of years \u2014 for their last gasps to register on Earth.

Before your eyes adjust, you perceive an ambient soundscape rolling in from all directions. Remixed \"sonic interpretation(s) of dying stars\" emanate from vintage reel-to-reel players; orbital loops of magnetic tape arc precariously toward the ceiling.

{"idx": "4223", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Does your kitchen need a detox?\nWith growing concerns about the health effects of Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical used in some plastics, it was good to see some products like drink bottles and food containers declaring themselves BPA free. That's until evidence emerged that a BPA substitute called Bisphenol S or BPS used in some BPA-free plastics was also under a cloud.\nThe latest study \u2013 new Canadian research published in the journal Endocrinology \u2013 has found that both BPA and BPS can trigger the formation of human fat cells. It echoes last year's strong statement by the Endocrine Society that there's now good evidence linking chemicals like BPA to health problems including obesity and diabetes. Like phthalates, another group of chemicals found in some plastics, BPA is an endocrine disrupter, meaning it can disrupt hormones including those influencing weight and appetite \u2013 not to mention reproduction.\nPlastic and food don't mix.\nIt's an argument for getting serious about edging plastics out of the kitchen.\nThe Endocrine Society is, after all, not a bunch of alarmist bloggers with questionable cred but a professional organisation of doctors and scientists specialising in hormone-related health problems. They recommend that the public, the media, politicians and government agencies should be educated on ways to keep these endocrine-disrupting chemicals out of food, water and air.\n\"Phthalates are fat soluble so if they're used in food packaging and containers they can migrate into meat, dairy, infant formula and processed foods \u2013 foods with a high fat content are most at risk,\" she says.\nAlthough evidence suggests that only small quantities of chemicals leach into food from packaging or plastic containers that's not necessarily reassuring.\n\"Endocrine-disrupting chemical like BPA and phthalates challenge the central idea in toxicology that the dose makes the poison \u2013 meaning a chemical is only harmful if the dose is large enough. The trouble with hormone-mimicking chemicals is that they have effects at extremely low dose concentrations,\" Immig says.\nUsing glass or ceramic rather than plastic containers for food in the pantry and fridge is the easiest way to reduce kitchen plastic, she suggests, but when it's time to replace plastic kitchen appliances like toasters, kettles, blenders, juicers and coffee makers, look for glass or stainless steel and check for any plastic parts inside that could come into contact with food. Use drink bottles made of metal or glass and stainless steel lunchboxes \u2013 and consider op shop crockery rather than plastic picnic ware.\nAs for plastic chopping boards, although they're typically made from polyethylene which doesn't contain BPA, it's hard to know for sure which products are BPA free because so many are imported, says Immig. She suggests sticking with solid wooden boards.\nWith BPA in the lining of many food cans, the only way to avoid them is try different brands to see which ones don't use them \u2013 organic brands are often plastic-free.\nCaroline Trickey, an accredited practising dietitian who runs cooking workshops in Sydney that include advice on reducing chemicals such as BPA in the kitchen, advises microwaving with containers made from glass or ceramic, not plastic, and covering them with paper towel not cling film.\n\"One of the main issues with plastic products is when they come into contact with heat which makes it easier for chemicals to leach into food,\" says Trickey, who replaced her own plastic containers with glass five years ago.\nSpeaking"}

We examine twelve projectors.\nThere is newcomer to the projection world: the multi-function. These marvelous toys include a DVD player, LCD or DLP projection system, and speakers for a maximum of portability and ease of use.\nSo will this new type of projector surpass classic models (without speakers or integrated players) as multifunction printers did the standard inkjet?\nOverall increase in resolution, the arrival of multi-function projectors, the advent of HD, and a rise in contrast ratios for LCDs and DLPs are contributing to home projection's gain in popularity.\nDLP : Digital Light Processing. This system is based on three elements: a light source, color wheel, and DMD (Digital Micromirror Device) chip. The color wheel is divided into three colors (red, green and blue) and, by spinning, it divides the white light of the lamp. These color fragments are then reflected by mirrors on the DMD chip, whose position varies by +/- 10% towards the projection lens. Your eye then reconstructs the colors of the final image by fusing all of the colors reflected by the mirrors. For example, when these mirrors rapidly reflect red and green, you will see yellow. The number of mirrors in the chip is equal to the resolution of the projector. For example, a resolution of 1280 x 720 equals 921,600 mirrors.\nLCD: Liquid Crystal Display. This system is composed of a lamp, two prisms and three LCD panels. The first prism is in charge of separating the light the lamp emits into the three components of red, green and blue. Thanks to a series of mirrors, light rays each hit an LCD panel which, depending on the position of its cells, may or may not let the light through. A last prism placed between the panels recombines the three light beams and sends the image through a projection lens.\nProjectors have one consumable that needs to be replaced-- the lamp. After an average of 2,000 hours, it has to be changed and this can cost between $250 and $800. 2,000 hours doesn\u2019t seem like much, but if we calculate three (2 hour) movies per week, this means replacement once every six years. If you are a real gaming buff and want to connect your game console, daily use of two hours will result in changing a new lamp after three years. After that, for the daily news or your favorite television series, having a normal TV on hand is a good idea.\n\"...For example, when these mirrors rapidly reflect red and yellow, you will see green...\"\nThis mirrors reflect white light. The color wheel is the device which lets the right color component pass in synch with the DMD.\nFor example: the DMD is reflecting the blue channel of the image but this is white light coming from the lamp, so the color wheel is letting only the blue part of the spectrum. The same with red and blue.\nThere are also DLP projectors that use three dmd's with three colored light sources( red green and blue) so no need for a color wheel. A frame being displayed with all color information on the screen at once. This means you can obtain 3 times the frame rate at a broader color depth with no rainbow effect.\nFor example, when these mirrors rapidly reflect red and yellow, you will see green.\nBes"}

{"idx": "4229", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Investing in energy can be tricky. Unlike other industries, the basis of a lot of these stocks is commodity prices, which can go up and down with the vagaries of supply and demand. And global oil prices have been on an upswing over the second half of this year after a disastrous few years, hitting a two-year high of more than $64 per barrel earlier this month versus below $30 early last year.\nSo picking the right energy stocks across this ever-changing backdrop is critical, weighing capital spending, debt levels and production growth against free cash flow, costs and return of capital to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks. After checking in with several long-time industry followers, herewith is a list of what they think are the top five best energy stocks \u2013 and five to probably avoid.\nThe biggest company on many analysts' favorites lists is Chevron Corp. Guy Baber, who follows the company at Piper Jaffray's Simmons & Co. International, pointed out the company's clear path to free cash flow improvement and an advantaged exploration and production portfolio anchored by a world-class position in West Texas' and New Mexico's Permian Basin. \"More than meets the eye...so we say buy,\" was the headline of one of his recent notes.\nBaber thinks Chevron offers the most attractive valuation of the big three U.S. major oil companies, which include Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. He has a price target of $131, versus a recent $117.23.\nPavel Molchanov, senior VP and energy analyst at Raymond James, singles out Marathon Oil Corp. as a good way to play the continued momentum in oil prices, which he thinks will reach a cyclical high of $65 per barrel next year.\nThe analyst said Marathon stands out as the only exploration and production company with a sizable presence in all four of the main U.S. liquids-rich resource plays: the Permian, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Bakken in the Rockies and the Scoop/Stack in Oklahoma. \"Following a return to production growth in 2Q17 and all-around strong 3Q results, the momentum exiting the year is set to be very robust,\" he said.\nMolchanov has assigned a $22 per share price target for Marathon's shares. They recently traded at $15.55.\nMolchanov also likes NextEra Energy Partners. which he characterizes as a quality yield play on the growth of wind power in the U.S. (its annual dividend is around 4%). He said if NextEra is correct in its position that wind will be the cheapest source of U.S. electricity by 2020, then it will certainly continue to gain market share. He has a price target on the stock of $43 per share, versus a recent $39.20.\nBill Herbert, senior research analyst at Simmons and a longtime follower of oilfield services stocks, likes Halliburton Co. He said the company has the highest leverage among its peers to the brisk drilling activity that's happening in North America, deriving half of its sales from it. He has a $53 per share price target on the stock, versus a recent $44.21.\nHerbert also likes Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., which has outperformed the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production exchange-traded fund (Symbol: XOP) by more than 6% despite third quarter production and earnings"}

But now that he has put the Olympic question to bed , Ovechkin is ready to prepare for a different kind of season and show that he and the Capitals are still relevant.\nOn paper, the Capitals lost 60 goals from their departed forwards alone and will be counting on more from Ovechkin \u2014 who turns 32 Sunday \u2014 and fellow leaders Nicklas Backstrom, T.J. Oshie and Evgeny Kuznetsov. Back-to-back seasons with the NHL\u2019s most points were followed by a salary-cap crunch that will infuse Washington\u2019s roster with some young, unproven talent and put the onus on the big-money players to shoulder a bigger load.\nThe past two seasons, the Capitals went out in the second round to the back-to-back Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. Fair or not in a team sport, Washington\u2019s lack of playoff success has affected how Ovechkin is seen as a player with three first-round and six second-round exits during his 12 NHL seasons.\nOvechkin was strongly encouraged by general manager Brian MacLellan last spring to train differently to prioritize speed over power. The Russian superstar did more running and less lifting but downplayed losing weight or going on any kind of special diet.\nCoach Barry Trotz, who met with Ovechkin in Moscow while he was in Russia to visit his son, noticed the captain\u2019s improved \u201cbody composition,\u201d which can\u2019t hurt his efforts to rebound from his lowest goal output in a non-lockout season since 2010-11.\nLosses to the Penguins showed the Capitals that team speed is as valuable as anything else, and MacLellan hopes that\u2019s one benefit of bringing in younger players. Prospects Jakub Vrana, Riley Barber, and Nathan Walker are competing for forward spots and Lucas Johansen, Christian Djoos and Madison Bowey for jobs on defence.\nOvechkin\u2019s job as the face of the franchise and a top player is safe, though he\u2019ll be counted on to produce more with less roster depth. So even though Ovechkin doesn\u2019t see scoring goals as his goal, he\u2019ll have to do that to get Washington back to the playoffs for the 10th time in 11 seasons.\nEven if Ovechkin is still 239 pounds like he ended last season, MacLellan said he looks happier, ready and excited to play.

Also, a new teacher training program coming soon to Worcester will teach instructors to weave artistic concepts into their non-arts curriculum.\n\"I think we\u2019ve increased a lot of the offerings for students over the last few years,\" particularly through the district\u2019s Advanced Placement programming, which added a new course, music theory, at Burncoat High School this year, said Magdalena Ganias, Worcester\u2019s manager of curriculum and professional learning.\n\"We know the arts spark creativity and outside-the-box thinking,\" said Susan O\u2019Neil, the district\u2019s deputy superintendent. \"Those are very 21st-century skills.\"\nArt is a core class for students in elementary and middle school, according to district officials, which is reflected in the state report published earlier this month. It found that from kindergarten to eighth grade, almost 98 percent of Worcester students, on average, took at least one arts class last year. That total excludes sixth grade, which had a roughly 8 percent arts course-taking rate, which Worcester is disputing as a statistical error.\nAt the high school level, however, far fewer students were enrolled in arts courses in 2017-18 \u2013 just 36 percent.\nWorcester\u2019s total arts course-taking rate of 73 percent, meanwhile, puts it in line with other large city school systems like Boston and Springfield, which also had around 71 to 72 percent of their students take an arts course last year. But outside of Clinton, which checked in at 62 percent, Worcester had the lowest percentage among K-12 districts in Central Massachusetts.\nElsewhere in the region, some of the K-12 districts with the highest percentages of students taking arts classes last year were Webster (93 percent), West Boylston (91 percent) and Spencer-East Brookfield (91 percent), which were well above the state average of 80 percent. Generally, across the state, a large majority of elementary and middle school students took an art class last year, while at the high schools only around half of students took one.\nWhile the state has long tracked course data, the education department decided to publish the arts class participation rates for 2018 in connection with the release of its new district report cards debuting next month, according to spokeswoman Jacqueline Reis.\n\"We met with a variety of parents, educators and others during the planning stages for the new accountability system that we rolled out in the fall, and many people said they wanted more information on students\u2019 access to the arts,\" she said. \"Although that is not a criteria in the new accountability system at this time, we\u2019re including it on school and district report cards to give people a fuller picture of individual schools and districts.\"\nWorcester school officials said there is a new requirement this year that high school students take at least one full year of arts classes, which can be divided up among the student\u2019s four years. That mandate already has pushed the district to add new arts programming, according to school officials, who said they likely will continue to do so. They said they expect next year\u2019s arts course-taking data to reflect higher enrollment rates for Worcester\u2019s high schoolers, after the system"}

In other words: self-regarding, defensive - closed.\nYet, at least on one level, Brazil might just be on its way to an unprecedented opening. With just over a year in office, President Dilma Rousseff has launched an \"openness offensive\" like no other in Brazil's history. Rousseff oversaw the enactment of a freedom of information law, a Truth Commission, and the construction of an open-data portal. She has also presided over the ousting of six ministers on allegations of corruption.\nAll of this might still be in vain. Truth Commission proceedings have still not begun and there are few signs that governments are prepared to make good on the freedom of information law when it takes effect next month. Ministers accused of corruption have still not been prosecuted, while new cases are largely being ignored.\nWill criminal charges slow Brazil's oil rush?\nIt is no time for backsliding; Brazil recently showcased its efforts to become more open, transparent and accountable on April 17 and 18, when it played host to 72 countries at the first meeting of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in Brasilia. President Rousseff was invited to co-chair this unprecedented multi-nation, multi-stakeholder global initiative by US President Barack Obama when he first visited Brazil in March 2011. Foreign ministers such as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made up invitees from the partnership's 55 member countries and there were also potential applicants from nearly 20 other countries, and citizen representatives from around the world.\nPresident Rousseff's leadership of the Open Government Partnership is a national and international test for this emerging power, and its performance will be evaluated largely based on progress made at home.\nRousseff has good reasons to strive for greater openness. Brazil's \"parliamentary presidentialism\" - featuring a national legislature populated by more than two dozen parties - requires the president to sustain majority support by handing-out ministry portfolios to unwieldy allies. Transparency is one of the few ways central planners can keep tabs on rent-seeking ministers, particularly those from \"allied\" parties. The well-known tradeoff for political support is corruption, inefficiency and incompetence, a trio of ills that has contributed to the crushing tax burden of Brazil - at over 35 per cent of GDP, the highest in the hemisphere.\nA fiscally responsible technocrat, Rousseff has been loath to accept rent-seeking in return for support. She sacked minister after minister for allegations of corruption in 2010 and 2011, but insider resistance in Congress to Rousseff's nationally dubbed faxina, a \"house-keeping\" of sorts, appears to be diminishing her appetite for unconditional good governance.\nThe latest corruption case illustrates President Rousseff's dwindling enthusiasm for eradicating graft. She has remained silent over the past few months as Fernando Pimentel, minister for development, industry and foreign trade and a longtime friend and ally, has dodged calls for resignation on charges of corruption. Pimentel reportedly accepted large payments for"}

The agreement was based on a decision from the Obama administration that allowed the Cuban baseball federation to be considered separate from the Cuban government.\nUnder the agreement, the players could receive 100 percent of a signing bonus, but the signing team would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation. This would have been similar to the system that is currently in place for players coming to MLB from Japan.\nThe Trump administration argues that the country's baseball federation is actually part of the Cuban government, making the business illegal under current law.\nCritics of the agreement, notably Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, feel that the posting fee going to the federation amounts to paying the Cuban government ransom for baseball players.\n\"The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society,\" said Garrett Marquis, a National Security Council spokesman.\nFor decades, Cuban players have risked their lives escaping from their homeland to destinations like Mexico, Haiti or the Dominican Republic, where they could establish residency.\n\"We stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba,\" MLB said in a statement Monday.\nIn a tweet retweeted by the Cuban Embassy, the baseball federation said that \"attacks with political motivation against the agreement harm the athletes, their families and the fans.\"\nEarlier in April, the Cuban federation announced the first list of 34 players who would be authorized to sign with MLB clubs."}

By yesterday, he had reopened the sites for his users to resume the snarky, anonymous barbs that are the company's hallmark.\nBut The Daily Beast has learned that the company\u2019s security remains as vulnerable as ever. [Update 12/14 9:53pm: The exploit has been patched.] Specifically, one hacker who participated in the Gawker attack, a member of the shadowy self-named group Gnosis, tells me that another vulnerability remains in place. Two others hackers, who did not participate in the Gnosis plot but are members of the same circle and observed the breach as it was happening, confirm this.\nThe hacker says there was considerable internal strife about whether to notify the company before publicly revealing the data.\nFurthermore, these three hackers say Gawker\u2019s security exposure has been an open secret for more than three months.\nThe ongoing vulnerability stems from Gawker's source code \u2014specifically, a hole in the company\u2019s preferred open source script, Minify, which ostensibly helps the site load faster. According to the three hackers, Gnosis felt confident that Minify provided a way in, but ultimately found yet another door (\u201cIt is not how we gained access,\u201d the attack participant tells me), which they would not disclose.\nGawker Media\u2019s problem: the version of Minify that they use is apparently three years old, and the company has not updated to a new, more secure version. This hole was even publicly disseminated on August 31 via the popular hacker emailing list Full Disclosure, which noted that while Minify could not by itself grant access, it provided other paths to Gawker\u2019s entire server.\nWhen I asked Denton on Tuesday afternoon whether he was certain of the security of his sites, he replied: \u201cI don't think anyone can ever say that with 100 percent confidence. But we have locked out this particular group of hackers, have changed all administrator passwords and we're taking other steps.\u201d When I then informed him about the Minify breach, he referred questions to Gawker\u2019s chief technology officer, Thomas Plunkett, who in turn said that they knew about it in September and \u201chave secured known issues\u201d and \u201care securing others as we discover them.\"\nThe hackers maintain, however, that the Minify hole has been alive and well. To emphasize how easy it is to exploit Minify, one of the hackers even gave me what amounted to a tour of Gawker\u2019s source files last night.\nAccording to the hacker who participated in the attack, Gnosis was an informal group centered around pulling pranks on one another before coming together to target Gawker. He adds that there was considerable internal strife about whether to notify the company before publicly revealing the data. \"It is my personal opinion that we should have contacted Gawker before releasing the source and given them the ways we got in,\" he says. \"But alas we did not.\"\nAn"}

Judge Igor Alisov of Moscow's Tverskoy district declared the case closed and there was no judgment against Magnitsky's estate.\nHowever, Magnitsky's former boss, William Browder, CEO and co-founder of the investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, was also found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison camp. He had been tried in absentia as part of the same case and said he will stop traveling to Russia or allied countries where he might face arrest.\nSome human rights activists, including those close to the Kremlin, called the ruling against Magnitsky and the trial itself absurd.\nFedotov, speaking in an interview, added that the ruling will damage the image of Russia abroad.\nThe Magnitsky case already has contributed to a chill in relations between Russia and the United States. In December 2012, Congress passed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Act, which imposed visa restrictions and financial sanctions against a group of Russian officials, policemen and tax inspectors involved in the prosecution and death of the lawyer.\nThe Kremlin immediately responded by imposing visa restrictions on various U.S. officials and by compelling parliament to adopt a highly controversial bill banning adoptions of Russian children by U.S. families. The law halted more than 300 adoption cases that were nearing completion, drawing anguished criticism from American and Russian adoption officials and families.\nThe case began in 2008, when Magnitsky publicly alleged that a group of law enforcement, security and tax officials had taken part in a complex tax conspiracy. As part of the scheme, he alleged, Hermitage Capital Management was improperly accused of tax evasion. Then, he said, the officials allegedly used Hermitage documents obtained during their investigation to funnel $230 million in tax refunds to associates at affiliated companies. The money was then allegedly channeled to overseas accounts.\nIn response to the allegations, authorities arrested Magnitsky for tax evasion.\nHis death in prison, in November 2009, was officially determined to have been caused by a heart attack. Officials said he had been given appropriate medical care.\nHowever, in July 2011, the presidential council led by Fedotov presented to then-President Dmitry Medvedev its findings that Magnitsky\u2019s poor health had been ignored in custody and there was evidence that he was beaten in the last minutes of his life.\nThe report also said that the circumstances of the alleged $230 million tax refund scam were closely linked with the lawyer\u2019s death and should be properly investigated.\nSince then, the Russian Investigative Committee has found no foul play behind Magnitsky\u2019s death. The only person charged in his death, a deputy chief of Butyrskaya Prison in Moscow, was acquitted of any negligent treatment.\nRussian lawmaker Andrei Lugovoy--who is himself a suspect in a notorious criminal case--expressed satisfaction with the ruling, and said it should put a stop to speculation about Magnitsky's death."}

Of the remaining, 14% think they'll see budget cuts and one-fifth said they aren't sure.\nThe numbers are similar for IT headcount expectations, with half saying employee levels will remain the same, a quarter expecting to add bodies, 11% saying they are likely to lose personnel and 14% unsure of what will happen.\nAsked what percentage of their IT budget is allocated to on-premise IT facilities vs. various hosted options, as a group the mean summary was: 75% on premise, 10% colocation (your equipment in someone else's building), 8% IaaS (the supplier owns the building and the equipment, but not the app), and 8% SaaS (the supplier owns the building, the equipment and the app).\nAsked to anticipate how that mix will change 18 months from now, the numbers show a migration to the cloud: 69% on premise; 11% colocation; 10% IaaS; 10% SaaS. Said another way, that's an 8% slide on the traditional side and 25% gains for IaaS and SaaS.\nWhile the study showed interest in and plans for a wide range of tech initiatives, it also revealed that companies are behind the eight ball when it comes to bring-your-own-device efforts.\nOnly 16% of the participants have BYOD policies in place, which is a basic building block for BYOD, and it is a fair bet that a far greater percentage of companies have employees accessing resources from personal devices, meaning these organizations have broad risk exposure.\nOf course most companies wouldn't know that employees were using mobile devices to log in because only 13% have deployed mobile device management or mobile application management tools. What's more, a whopping 42% say MDM/MAM isn't even on their radar.\nOn a related note, only 20% of the respondents say they have formally added support for tablets, and only 8% have built corporate app stores. While it is tempting to cite the data as evidence that the BYOD hype is outpacing reality, the plethora of smartphones and tablets in meetings would suggest otherwise."}

Or, if we talk about it, we'll find a secular way of doing it that will not be offensive to people of non-belief. So, that you go through life with these alternate voices.\"\nAcclaimed journalist and essayist Richard Rodriguez writes about the intersection of his personal life with some of the most vexing cultural and political problems facing America.\nThe son of Mexican immigrants to California, Rodriguez grew up in a home where his parents clung closely to their native culture and only Spanish was spoken. His struggles to learn English and assimilate into American society served as the raw material for his well-known 1982 autobiography, HUNGER OF MEMORY: THE EDUCATION OF RICHARD RODRIGUEZ, a milestone examination of education, cultural identity, and social alienation that remains controversial today for its criticism of bilingual education and affirmative action.\nIn 1992, Rodriguez penned DAYS OF OBLIGATION: AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MEXICAN FATHER, an extended personal essay exploring the moral and cultural gap separating Protestant America and Catholic Mexico. The book was a runner-up for the 1993 Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction. A decade later, Rodriguez published BROWN: THE LAST DISCOVERY OF AMERICA, a series of essays on art, culture, and racial politics that uses the color \"brown\" as a metaphor for in-between states of being, arguing in particular that America's historical concept of race as limited to black and white is outdated and culturally damaging.\nAs a journalist, Richard Rodriguez has worked for more than 20 years for Pacific News Service in San Francisco and is a contributing editor to Harper's magazine and a frequent commentator on THE NEWSHOUR WITH JIM LEHRER on PBS.

The company said it would not comment further.\nWhat makes this likely that Samsung could release a Chrome OS netbook? Several reasons. For one thing, Acer and Samsung have already been confirmed by Google as the launch partners for the Chrome OS netbooks, with a mid-2011 release date. Early May falls within that category.\nSecond, specifications for the first Chrome OS netbook, dubbed the \"Alex,\" have already leaked.\nSamsung's netbook is predicted to come with a 1,200-by-800 pixel display that will likely feature a webcam built right above the screen.\nThe 10-inch netbook will run on a 1.5-GHz dual-core Intel Atom CPU, the N550, which comes as part of Intel's Pineview series of 45-nanometer processors. For the uninitiated, Pineview is both the codename and successor to Intel's first foray into low-power, mobile-themed processors, Diamondville. The former comes under the Pine Trail platform; the latter never really had a platform name, per se, unless you're counting \"Atom\" itself, which is really the overall brand name for Intel's low-power processor line.\nThe unknown source claims that the netbook will come equipped with 2 gigabytes of RAM and a Samsung SSD, but no capacity sizes for the drive were revealed in the allegedly leaked information. Verizon has been tipped to be the WLAN supplier for the netbook, although some have said that the Alex will contain a Gobi card for on-the-go network access.\nGoogle also said then that it would have \"partner devices\" by mid-year.\nThe Cr-48 netbooks will have to show some improvement before they actually launch, however. While Google implemented \"cloud printing\" services that allowed them to print remotely, the devices lacked any support for a VPN, which made them nearly unusable in a business environment. The netbook's USB port was also nonfunctional.\nAssuming that Google points the way toward additional upgrades in its Android line, it wouldn't be unusual to see additional Galaxy-class tablets or smartphones at the event. At this point, however, we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify the WLAN 3G access status of the Cr-48."}

Apartment prices in large Chinese cities often exceed those in Australia by some margin.\nThe sector accounts for almost one-sixth of the economy, fanned by property prices that can rival or exceed those in Australian cities even though average incomes remain a fraction of those of Australians.\nThe building binge included adding about 20 per cent more than the entire floor space in Britain in China last year alone, said Jiang Kejun, a research professor with the Energy Research Institute, a think tank under the powerful National Development and Reform Commission.\nEven with power demand basically flat this year, China continues to add almost 1 gigawatt of new coal-fired generating capacity \u2013 equivalent to a large power station in Australia \u2013 to the grid each week.\nProfessor Jiang, who is also a government climate change adviser, told Fairfax Media planners are considering to slapping a ban on new coal-fired capacity: \"Now we are just talking about this in the new five-year plan \u2013 whether we go to zero new coal-fired power plants.\"\nEven without an order from the top, construction must slow. \"They will automatically stop,\" he said. \"There is no market, they are dying.\"\nThere will be no growth in coal or steel demand in China \u2013 in fact significant declines.\nTim Buckley, a former Citi analyst now with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said China's coal-fired power plants were operating at less than 50 per cent capacity with average hours of operation down more than 9 per cent in the first seven months of 2015.\n\"It'd be crazy of them not to [ban net new plants]\", Mr Buckley said. \"I'm amazed they haven't done it already.\"\nChina's economy is likely to grow 6."}

This year, Amazon will surpass Macy\u2019s, which last year announced it would shut 100 stores, to become the largest seller of apparel in America, by several analysts\u2019 estimates.\nIt is looking at ways to keep expanding, too. Amazon is exploring the possibility of selling custom-fit clothing, tailored to the more precise measurements of customers, and it has considered acquiring clothing manufacturers to further expand its presence in the category.\nIf there are tipping points in retail \u2014 moments when shopping behavior swings decisively in one direction \u2014 there\u2019s a strong case to be made that apparel is reaching one now, with broad implications for jobs, malls and shopping districts.\nThose moments often occur around the time that online shopping reaches about 20 percent of total national retail spending in a category, the research firm L2 has concluded after studying the evolution of e-commerce. Online clothing and accessory shopping\u2019s share of retail hit 21 percent last year, according to estimates by Cowen and Company, a stock research firm.\n\u201cI do think this year is the year apparel e-commerce takes off,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2.\nApparel has been something of an e-commerce laggard. In years gone by, buying clothing over the internet was only for the fearless, with most shoppers unwilling to take the risk that a dress or a pair of shoes would fit poorly or look terrible on them.\nIt took time, but shopping habits for clothing are shifting profoundly.\nAmazon\u2019s solution was to improve clothing selection, pour money into photography to give internet shoppers a better representation of garments and offer free returns on most apparel so customers could order untroubled by the thought of sending items back.\nPia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article.\nAmazon is by far the biggest beneficiary of e-commerce growth, accounting for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the nation last year, estimated Slice Intelligence, a company that measures online shopping.\nBut there\u2019s little chance Amazon will come to have in apparel the crushing dominance it has established in, say, books, because of the way clothing sales are fragmented among so many retailers. Amazon accounts for half the country\u2019s consumer book market on a unit basis, according to the Codex Group, a book market research firm.\nLast year, the company\u2019s gross merchandise apparel sales \u2014 Amazon\u2019s direct sales of clothing plus the commission it collects on sales by independent merchants on its site \u2014 were $22 billion, or 6.6 percent of the market, Cowen estimated. By 2021, the firm has forecast, Amazon will account for just over 16 percent of apparel sales.\nStill, Amazon faces hurdles in its apparel business. Some apparel makers have been frustrated by the prevalence of counterfeit versions of their products on Amazon, peddled by independent merchants.\nLast year, Birkenstock, the sandal maker, stopped selling its footwear directly to Amazon, becoming one of the biggest brands to cease doing business with the retailer. Since then, Birkenstock has warmed somewhat to Amazon, allowing authorized independent sellers to continue to sell its products on the site.\n\u201cWe have seen improvements on the Amazon"}

Why are Americans so unconvinced of that?\nThe jobless rate in October fell to 5.8%, the lowest since July 2008, and the broader measure (which includes discouraged workers and the like) is down to 11.5%, the lowest since September 2008. The economy has added 2.6 million jobs in the past year, nearly 2 million of them in the private sector.\nYet exit polls this week found that 35% of voters say the economy is getting better, 31% say it is getting worse, and 33% say it\u2019s about the same, which for most is not a good thing.

Exit polls this week found that half the voters expect life for the next generation of Americans to be worse than for the current generation; that\u2019s more doubt than at any time since the question was first posed in exit polls in 1996.

But one thing is pretty obvious: If you like Brand, you\u2019ll love BrandX, but you might be left wanting.\nThe weekly foray into late night is a welcome idea for FX, but it might have miscalculated on the half-hour length, which seems too truncated for a show of this kind and might be grumblesome to Brand fans.\nThe question for FX, of course, is what about the people who might have never heard of him or maybe have heard of him only via his ex-wife Katy Perry? What about people who don\u2019t really like him but don't actively loathe him? Selling a personality, especially one as electrified as Brand, is a lot harder than selling a show about something. In this case, Brand is the show.\nIn some way, then, this review -- endorsement? -- is for people who haven\u2019t made up their minds about Brand and thus are wondering about tuning in to BrandX tonight.\nStrip away the movies you might not have liked, strip away the tabloid coverage, etc., and judge Brand on his talent, smarts and humor, which combine into nothing less than a tour de force of brilliance when he\u2019s on -- and he always seems to be on. Comedy is subjective, of course, but BrandX is ostensibly an exercise in Brand riffing on the news (which is why FX couldn\u2019t send out more episodes; it tapes Brand on the road wherever he goes and makes the turnaround almost instant so that week\u2019s topics are relevant and timely). To watch him riff is what makes him so magnetic. He\u2019s intelligent without hitting you over the head with it and clearly unafraid to take a subject \u2013 like spirituality, the essence of tonight\u2019s premiere \u2013 and run with it even if his audience might have chosen something more in the pop culture milieu.\nHe takes the manic energy of Robin Williams and turns it into something more modern, less shtick-heavy, with characters making funny voices (his own voice is funny enough in its high-pitchiness), then straps it to a rocket and hits hyperspace. Sometimes the point or the joke is not what Brand ultimately concludes with; it\u2019s the journey to get there. And in BrandX he\u2019s able to use his being British as a kind of Brother From Another Planet conceit where he tries to understand what Americans are about and into, while also delivering gibes at both cultures. (Brand will use the stoic and serious Matt Stoller, a former Congressional policy adviser and Harvard grad, as \u201ca political, economic and historical consultant.\u201d) Stoller is less co-host or foil than a guy who takes computer polls, flashes news photos and clips on the screen and is the calm to Brand\u2019s British storm.\nBrandX could look completely different in a few weeks -- who knows? -- but the core of the show is Brand\u2019s personality and style, which is unlikely to change, and you can sample it pretty accurately tonight.

For 75 years, that's about all that students at Carnegie Mellon University could see as they passed by the unfinished facade of the College of Fine Arts. Now, the neglected facade is alive with activity again - thanks to a generous alumnus, two architects, and an international team of stone carvers. Their goal: complete five large niches that have stood unfinished for three-quarters of a century.\nSome things are worth waiting for.\n\"Every architect's and sculptor's dream is to work with so much stone,\" says Paul Rosenblatt, one of the project's architects.\nBut costs are so high and expertise so limited that stone carving is very nearly a lost art in the United States. The university hired a New York-based company, Cathedral Stoneworks, to recruit a team of British and French carvers with the skills necessary to do the work.\nCarnegie Mellon's \"Niches Project\" is one of the largest stone-carving efforts now under way in the US.\nThe project began around 1910. The university's original architect, Henry Hornbostel, envisioned that the niches would represent five major styles of art and architecture: Greek, Roman, Gothic, Renaissance, and non-Western.\nA team of Italian stone carvers started work on the Roman entryway and the Renaissance niche. But the work stopped in 1913, for reasons that remain a campus mystery.\nFinally, in the late 1980s, a $1 million gift from Carnegie Mellon alumnus Verner Purnell got the project moving again.\nUniversity personnel researched Hornbostel's drawings, drew up plans, and hired architects to refine the work. In October, the new team of stone carvers began their two-year project. Stone carving may seem romantic from afar, but up close it is painstaking and dirty work.\nLimestone dust covers Emmanuel Fourchet as he crooks his neck to hand-chisel some fine details into the stone. At times he has to lie flat on his back to get just the right angle.\nThere's little margin for error, since mistakes can't be erased. \"Etched in stone\" takes on real meaning up on the carvers' scaffolding.\nTastes have changed since 1913 and so has the project. The new architects have simplified the decoration in order to draw attention to main features (and save money).\nCarvers have recast the university's current dean of fine arts as a kind of Bacchanalian figure.

Derk Sauer, founder of The Moscow Times, and chairman of Sanoma Independent Media's supervisory board, is candid about the risks ahead.\n\"1998 looked very dramatic, and it was dramatic for a couple of weeks,\" Sauer said in an interview in his office at Sanoma Independent Media. \"But then things quickly started to normalize, especially for The Moscow Times.\n\"Now it is a much more complicated situation because there is a long-term economic crisis. Foreign companies are cutting costs everywhere because their headquarters are in trouble, and the expat community is not that important anymore for Russian business, for the restaurants and airlines. Their main clientele is Russian now, and they are not advertising in The Moscow Times to reach the Russian clientele.\"\nThe newspaper's management has responded by refocusing on its core market while deliberately limiting circulation to control costs. The strategy has served the newspaper well in the past. Circulation grew from 30,000 copies a day in 1997, to 35,000 by 2000, where it has stayed.

You cannot just write about business without writing about Putin.\"\nAt its launch in 1992, the newspaper focused on local news along with international news, practical information, a going-out guide and a TV guide in English that proved popular.\nAdvertisers targeted the expat community. \"From 1992 to '97 there was only one group of people who had money, maybe two groups: the mafia and expats,\" Sauer said. \"They had hard currency, so all the restaurants, the airlines, the service industries were all geared toward the expat community.\"\nBefore long, however, advertisers were also targeting Russians, mainly through the job classifieds. Many companies had foreign directors who wanted bilingual Russian staff.\nDespite that whirlpool of expat cash, The Moscow Times did not make money at first. \"The first two years were a struggle,\" Sauer said. Advertising only picked up in 1994-95. In the early years, Sauer and his fellow founders, a group of Dutch friends, almost ran out of money. \"Then my wife and my business partner Annemarie van Gaal said we should start a women's magazine,\" Sauer said. \"That is how Cosmopolitan started, as a joint venture. From day one, in 1994, it made money. \"\nThe Moscow Times began in March 1992 as a twice-weekly publication, edited by Michael Hetzer, now a U.S.-based novelist. His successor, Meg Bortin,"}

Mike Ricciuti of Cnet should be given due credit for extracting this BillBlurt, in an interview conducted this week at TechEd.\nProtesting that Microsoft's views on open source have been \"misunderstood,\" Gates comes up with something not so much misunderstandable as only marginally comprehensible: \"But if you say to people, 'Do you understand the GPL?' (then) they're pretty stunned when the Pac-Man-like nature of it is described to them.\"\nThink hard about that one - it's a little thing that runs around gobbling up everything it comes across, like alternative GUIs for Dos, disk compression, independent TCP/IP stacks, the browser market, email clients, instant messaging, digital audio and CD burning... No wait, that's something else entirely. What Bill really means is that the GPL is the Borg/bodysnatcher de nos jours, tainting everything it comes into contact with and assimilating it to The Hive.\nAside from his weird new image, Gates seems largely to be peddling the current Microsoft line on the GPL, claiming that it makes it impossible for a commercial company to use any of that [i.e. GPL] work or build on that work.\" This line is of course almost entirely untrue, the small nugget of veracity being that you can't just lift GPL code and shove it straight into Microsoft Bloat 2002 without there being some kind of come-back. Whereas you're perfectly free to swipe any of that source code that Microsoft is so busily sharing, amend it as you wish then resell it as part of your own product line.\nWell all right, you can't do that either but presumably these two situations are entirely different for reasons that Bill Gates can, but we cannot, fathom. Bill adds that what happened with Sendmail and TCP/IP couldn't have happened under the GPL; we could at this juncture conjure with the notion that not being able to swipe things and run off with them would inconvenience certain large commerical developers greatly, but on reflection we fear we'd better not.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's latest tack in the anti-GPL FUD war is a document authored by the \"Shared Source Initiative\" (presumably the Redmond Green Beret team on this particular case) and aimed at 'explaining' the issues associated with GpL software to businesses. One of the highlights of this wondrous document is that \"Because the GPL is so frequently misunderstood and because it attempts, under certain circumstances, to impose significant obligations on licensees and their intellectual property rights, no responsible business should use GPL software without ensuring that its lawyers have read the license and explained the business\u2019 rights and obligations.\"\nWe at The Register shamefully neglected our fiduciary duties to our shareholders by letting our techies shove Red Hat onto the server without first commissioning a detailed legal analysis of the implications And now we're going to get sued, die and go to hell, oh dear oh dear.

Their mission: apply human-centered design to poverty-related challenges \u2026 and in the process, change the way that a for-profit business can use their resources to create social good.\n\u201cIn the recession of 2008 and 2009, foundations lost up to 40% of their endowments,\u201d explains Wyatt. \u201cThere was so much desire within social enterprises and nonprofits to work with us, and so much desire amongst the designers to work on these projects, but there was really a question of funding. So we started to ask, How might we approach this differently? What might a different kind of business model look like?\u201d After months of research on the strongest solution, Ideo.org launched about two years ago as a philanthropic outlet for Ideo employees, including a fellowship program for outside talent that brings future leaders from the worlds of design and social enterprise (and even journalism!) to collaborate.\nAs the women at the helm of Ideo.org, Wyatt and Martin\u2019s partnership seems like a perfect mesh between the analytic and the creative. Wyatt studied anthropology and knew she wanted to do good in the world, so a college advisor turned her on to the idea of working in international development. She spent five years on projects funded by the U.S. government, learning along the way that she had real concerns about the way those programs were structured. \u201cWe were going to Uganda or Bolivia and kind of telling people, like, \u2018Okay, this is the way we think you should do it,\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cIt seemed like those projects had really high budgets, little impact, and almost no sustainability in terms of what happened at the end of the project. It just seemed to me that there must be a better way to do things.\u201d She started at Ideo six years ago, and says she gradually became aware that the company needed \u201ca different kind of business model\u201d to scale their impact on the communities they were trying to help. Now focused on fundraising via both grant-writing and donations, she also handles work on the business and operational side of Ideo.org.\nThe lightning bolt for Martin came when she was out in the community on that first Kenya trip\u2013and you can see that bolt radiating through the projects Ideo.org has focused on since. \u201cThese were people who were just like me, who were facing very different circumstances, and who were making logical decisions based on what was happening in their environment,\u201d says Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s the sameness that\u2019s always so striking. We\u2019re always intimidated by the differences, but once you\u2019re sitting in someone\u2019s house, having a cup of tea with them, you relate on such a human level that those things don\u2019t seem as important.\u201d So when Ideo.org teamed up with the Global Alliance to work on a clean cookstove project in Tanzania, they started by going into the community to ask women how they actually used their cookstoves\u2013or why they didn\u2019t\u2013and immersed themselves in the local culture, shopping, hosting a cookoff, spending entire days with families. \u201cWhat resulted from that work is not that cookstoves aren\u2019t used, but they\u2019re not the only decision,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWhether or not you need to make something pretty quickly, how much money you have on hand for fuel, how many people you\u2019"}

And how do they belong?\"\n\"We believe the thrust and focus of the gospel is the breaking down of former boundaries of exclusion and the expanding of the welcome of Jesus to all,\" he goes on to say.\nOn the church's website, it shares that Senior Pastor Fred Harrell was inspired by Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, led by Tim Keller, to start City Church (San Francisco) in 1997. The church is also active in church planting and development within the Bay Area and across America. Harrell says that City Church's Board has followed the Reformed Tradition of going directly to Scripture to find counsel.\n\"For so long this has been a 'case closed' kind of issue for evangelicals,\" he comments. \"Scholars and leaders who have previously been united in their interpretations are coming to different conclusions. This does not mean that your view must change, but it does counsel humility with how we each hold our views. Given the status and variety of these opinions, what has become clear to us is that there is no longer clear consensus on this issue within the evangelical community.\"\nBefore making the decision, the Board read Ken Wilson's book, A Letter to My Congregation, Harrell says, and describes the book as showing \"great empathy and maturity to model unity and patience with those who are in different places on this conversation, all the while dealing honestly with Scripture.\"\n\"If Jesus were the pastor of City Church, what would he say to the people who are asking if they can belong?\" the pastor asks. \"As we consider the life of Christ, his example of love, his call to embrace the outsider and cast down, and his patience with those earnestly seeking him, what is a Christ-like response?\"\nEnding the requirement for celibacy for gays \"aligns with our existing core vision: the doors of this church are as wide as the arms of the Savior it proclaims,\" he adds.\n\"We will no longer discriminate based on sexual orientation and demand lifelong celibacy as a precondition for joining. For all members, regardless of sexual orientation, we will continue to expect chastity in singleness until marriage,\" Harrell concludes."}

Please email us to ask a question, but keep in mind that we cannot offer specific investment- or stock-related advice.\n\"Sell on Rosh Hashanah and buy on Yom Kippur\" is an old saying on Wall Street that coincides with the Jewish High Holidays. What does it mean and, more importantly, does it work? Thanks, S.G.\nThat old Wall Street adage runs along the lines of \"Sell in May and go away\" or the so-called Super Bowl Indicator. It's one of those maxims based more on market lore than on fundamental analysis.\nBut hey, it gives traders something to talk about.\nRosh Hashanah, which marks the Jewish new year and literally means \"head of the year,\" occurs on the first and second days of the Hebrew month of Tishri. Since the Jewish calendar, which is lunisolar, or based on the sun and moon, differs from the solar-based Gregorian calendar used by most people around the world, Rosh Hashanah does not fall on the same date each year.\nIt starts this year -- the Jewish year 5767 -- on the evening of Sept. 22, and runs through the weekend. Yom Kippur falls on Oct. 2.\nRosh Hashanah also kicks off what is known as the Days of Awe, a 10-day period of intense reflection that culminates on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.\nIn order to concentrate on their prayers instead of their portfolios, there was a time when many Jews would sell their holdings ahead of the Days of Awe, or \"Sell on Rosh Hashanah and buy on Yom Kippur.\"\n\"The saying goes back to the 1920s, when it was said that this was the strategy of the Loebs and other prominent Jewish financiers, but it has not really been relevant since,\" says Larry Wachtel of Wachovia securities.\nAnother possibility, speculates Rabbi Michael Katz of Temple Beth Torah in Jericho, N.Y., is that it makes good financial sense.\n\"On Rosh Hashanah, things are good, upbeat and positive. We gather together, wish each other a Happy New Year and we feast. That is the perfect time to sell, when times are high. On the other hand, investors like to buy when the market is low, and Yom Kippur is a downer. We worry about being sealed for death, and we fast.\"\nSince the Jewish High Holidays fluctuate each year, it is hard to get a definitive answer as to whether the strategy really works. Nevertheless, during the Days of Awe last year the S&P 500 dropped 4.1%, from 1228 to 1177.

Tihany joked to a hallway full of journalists.\nThe designer of restaurants for Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, not to mention another Broadmoor restaurant, Summit, reappeared later that night to officially celebrate the opening of one of the vaunted hotel's newest ventures: Ristorante del Lago, which replaces Charles Court but keeps chef Justin Miller at the helm. We brought you a small look at the Italian cuisine in January, with plates ranging between $16 and $36, but last night was the real deal.\n\"My wife and I had dinner here a couple of nights ago, incognito,\" he told the crowd. \"And it was, I mean, these guys in the kitchen made a spaghetti cacio e pepe that was as good as any any spaghetti cacio e pepe you find in a good restaurant in Rome.\"\n\"This, contrary to the common belief, is not an Italian restaurant in terms of design. This is what you think an Italian restaurant should look like,\" Tihany said to laughter. \"Because most restaurants in Italy look pretty shabby.\" He expounded: \"I think most Americans have this Euro-deficiency syndrome: They think that everything in Europe is great. Well, think again.\"\nWe'll leave critical notes for future reviews, so check out some pictures of our meal in the meantime, with even more photos from Matthew Schniper available in a slideshow here."}

The very institutions which should be spreading knowledge, encouraging creative thinking and promoting essential skills, have been caught in an exercise of cynical, commercially-driven deceit. Their behaviour is the very opposite of the purpose of education.\nThis crisis over exams has come about entirely because of politics and people in the sector acting for commercial gain. During Labour\u2019s 13 years of rule, there was insidious collusion between the exam boards and government to mislead the public into thinking that standards were on the rise.\nLabour politicians could trumpet ever higher grades as evidence of the success of their spectacular increases in spending. Meanwhile, the exam boards also had a vested interest in this mass deception; the more pupils passed, the happier the schools would be and the more schools would choose to use those exam boards. In turn, this would increase the boards\u2019 profit and turnover. So a huge commercial racket came into being driven by greed.\nEffectively the boards have been running a lucrative cartel, with the aim of raising productivity rather than knowledge and understanding. Though the examiners and markers themselves are often badly paid, those at the top have reaped huge rewards for this strategy. One Edexcel chief was on an astonishing \u00a3327,000 a year, while salaries of \u00a3200,000 are common, an excess all too typical of the self-serving quango class of bosses that New Labour created.\nThe tragedy is that those who should have blown the whistle on this racket have instead connived in it. The qualifications watchdog Ofqual knew about the courses in which exam boards told teachers how to boost exam grades, which are publicly advertised, but did nothing. What has been grievously lacking at Ofqual is both a sense of leadership and an understanding of education.\nThe current head, Glenys Stacey, is a public sector bureaucrat who follows the great British tradition of people being appointed into top jobs in areas about which they know little. Nor, up until now, have Ofsted or schools distinguished themselves by their determination to root out abuses.\nTragically for our young people, this squalid saga is part of a wider pattern of decline in British schooling. Such a failure has come about not because of any lack of resources \u2013 the excuse always favoured by the teaching unions, local education authorities and left-wing campaigners.\nIndeed, as a nation, we have been spending more than ever before on state schools, as reflected in the significant rise in teachers\u2019 salaries and in the construction of shiny new buildings across the country.But the increase in expenditure over the past 15 years has been accompanied by a remorseless drop in standards. Subjects have been dumbed-down, as grade-inflation has soared.\nThis process of dumbing-down can be seen all around us. The idea of intellectual inquiry has been replaced by a destructive obsession with ticking boxes and reaching arbitrary targets.\nExams are undoubtedly less demanding than they were in the past.

Hook Em, Shane Buechele #7.\"\nBuechele entered his name into the NCAA's transfer portal back in January.\n\"He [Buechele] didn't feel right being around this team knowing his intentions in May. He's still on scholarship, trains here and we check on him every week academically,\" Texas Head Coach Tom Herman said Wednesday afternoon during his National Signing Day press conference.\nBuechele will have two years of eligibility at SMU. He finished his career as a Longhorn with 4,636 yards passing, 30 passing touchdowns, 16 interceptions and four rushing touchdowns.\nBut, Buechele will forever be a fan favorite. He began his career during Charlie Strong's final season as UT's head coach in 2016. Buechele led the Longhorns to a season opening win against Notre Dame that season, becoming the first true freshman starting quarterback in the program's history since Bobby Layne in the 1940s.\nHis record as the Texas starting quarterback: 10 wins and nine losses.\nDuring the 2017 season, Buechele suffered two different injuries and split time with then-true freshman quarterback Sam Ehlinger.\nPrior to this past season, Coach Herman elected to start Ehlinger and the rest is history. It was a decision which resulted in 10 wins, including a Sugar Bowl victory against Georgia.\nThroughout it all, Buechele was one of Ehlinger's biggest supporters. In fact, Buechele played in a pair of games and saved the day when Ehlinger suffered an injury against Baylor, leading Texas to a 23-17 win.\nBuechele was the ultimate team player. He was one of the team's leaders despite the lack of playing time.\nIn fact, Ehlinger, took to Twitter after the announcement to give praise to Buechele.\nThe reason for transferring: Buechele acknowledges Ehlinger is the starting quarterback moving forward and wants to utilize his two remaining seasons of eligibility as a starter.\nBuechele deserves that and will have that opportunity to become the SMU Mustangs' QB1 in August."}
{"idx": "4309", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Who will stop Stephen Harper?\nAs I watch with alarm Stephen Harper's lead over the Liberals solidify, even as he displays contempt for climate change efforts, and disdain for parliament, I am reminded of Ronald Reagan. What I remember is this: on almost every major issue on which he took a strong public stand, he was opposed by a majority of Americans. But that did not stop them from supporting him, giving him high ratings as President -- and re-electing him.\nWhat explains the contradiction? Americans saw in Reagan a man who, specific policies aside, believed strongly in what he was doing. And conversely, they saw in the Democrats a party of shameless opportunists who would claim to believe in anything if it got them a few extra votes. They were tired of trying to decipher the complexities of the issues, tired of the spin, distrustful of government and the media. Their default position was to go with the guy who seemed to say what he meant and mean what he said. They were looking for someone with principles -- and apparently any principles would do.\nIf Stephen Harper is Ronald Reagan then Michael Ignatieff seems destined to play the role of Hubert Humphrey or Bill Clinton or Al Gore -- Democrats with infinitely flexible principles and an ethical relativism that has degraded democratic politics in the U.S. The Liberal Party of Canada is the classic party of opportunism whose century of success as the natural governing party was predicated on running from the left with progressive policies, and then governing from the right, with policies designed to favour Bay Street. It worked so long as it was well-executed, and the party maintained internal unity and self discipline.\nBut now the Liberals are neither united nor disciplined. Paul Martin's ruthless ten year assault on his own party in aid of becoming its leader is still itself playing out in new incarnations of backstabbing and public disputes. So divided by the trench warfare between the two camps that no one within the ranks of party could lead it without being immediately assassinated, they went to the U.S. recruit an outsider with no battle-baggage.\nBut what they got was a postmodern academic with no convictions that couldn't be trumped by particular circumstance. A human rights advocate who okays torture; a leader whose philosophy dictates that he can't feel strongly about anything -- for whom right and wrong are so intertwined he just can't be sure which is which.\nSuch a leader may well be incapable of fighting the pitbull ruthlessness of Stephen Harper whose passion for dismantling Canada knows no bounds. Ignatieff's persona is that of the effete snob personally offended by a man who refuses to play by the rules. But he can't adjust and recognize that it is Harper who is now making the rules and thus defining the landscape on which the battle takes place.\nTo his credit, Ignatieff has had some promising moments in the past few months -- as when he mused aloud about the necessity of (ultimately) raising taxes to deal with the structural deficit. But he didn't have the courage to stick to it and the media and his own party smacked him so hard he almost forgot he'd ever said it. And his messaging on Harper was dead on. He attacked him on the tax issue: \"We pay taxes, Mr. Harper, because we're all in this together. It costs us something, but it makes Canada the place it is: a place where we look out for each other.\" And he revealed the theme on which he should fight the next election: \"Stephen Harper ...believes that the only good government is no government at all.\" He topped it"}

How will they increase their market share? The stock is richly valued. What is your call on Maruti and what do you think the company will deliver by way of earnings today?\nMahesh Patil: If you look at the auto stocks in general, especially the four-wheeler space, there are early signs of some volume pick-up but it is still not too great. Most of the auto companies have been benefitting because of the fall in commodity prices. In case of Maruti also, it had the the yen benefit last year and as a result operating profit margin has improved significantly compared to their historical average level. So the margins are at kind of peak level and while volume growth could increase next year, margins can be at risk. So that is where one needs to watch out in some of the names next year whether the margins are able to sustain at these levels and apart from that, as consumer discretionary spend goes into next year, we should see some revival even in rural demand assuming that monsoons are normal. So broadly, in auto, going forward you should see earnings if not too strong but at least better than most of the other sectors.\nET Now: Banks are where the carnage is and this time it is universal carnage. It is not just restricted to PSU banks. It is private banks also which are getting smashed. So what explains the underlying pain in the entire private banking space? Numbers were not that bad. We heard from IndusInd Bank, we got it from HDFC Bank, Axis Bank numbers were not that bad but markets are just punishing these stocks.\nMahesh Patil: The banking sector is a top-down macro call. So with the economy really not picking up to the extent one was expecting, the recovery in asset quality is going to be slow and that is probably weighing down some of the banking stocks especially those with a very large corporate exposure. The metal sector is one where things still are not really bottomed out on the global front. So that pain is what is dragging down the valuations in some of these stocks because it is not clear if we have seen the bottom in terms of asset quality. Though our view is that most of it should come out in the December and March quarters and especially with RBI now requesting banks to recognise some of these assets which were currently not being restructured and where there is genuine stress. So, once these things get highlighted and the company starts to acknowledge its problems, the market would then probably give them benefit of doubt and make adjustments to the book value and then you should see the kind of pain we are seeing currently, easing off. But banks with retail focus have shown good numbers and couple of them have reported numbers showing pretty decent growth. That trend should continue.\nET Now: Just an extension of the point that you were making, come next week and we will have the RBI policy as well to deal with. What is the expectation from the policy? Do you think it is going to be a status quo policy and the commentary would be a little bit more tilted towards the global economic scenario?\nMahesh Patil: There are a couple of factors on the inflation side. We have seen a marginal rise but again it is because of the base effect and the RBI Governor probably will wait for more data points before really taking a decision.

The service has long seemed too good to be true, and each new report about its uncertain future\u2014including abrupt and unpopular subscription changes, a revealing S.E.C. filing, and a tough auditor report\u2014has made it appear as though the end is really, truly nigh. Still, MoviePass has held on\u2014though the latest in this line of bad omens seems more dire than the rest. This week, MoviePass endured a service outage, one that resulted from the company temporarily running out of cash\u2014and being forced to borrow $5 million in order to keep service going.\nIn a follow-up tweet, the company acknowledged that the bug wasn\u2019t because of its card-processor partners.\nAnd this is not the only major issue MoviePass has faced this week. According to CNN, its stock price dropped more than 50 percent this week after the company announced a plan to bounce its stock price from 8 cents to $21. It\u2019s not the first time recently that MoviePass stock has taken a dive.\nOh, MoviePass. What are we going to do with you? For avid moviegoers, the company is a dream come true, an amazingly cheap way to actually watch films in theaters, just as filmmakers intended. (\u201cNone more than me,\u201d Christopher Nolan whispers to himself.) Yet that $10 price tag\u2014criminally affordable!\u2014has proven slightly too much to bear, with damning new details coming to the fore with an alarming frequency.

The state and national maritime academies are key partners as they are educating, shaping and producing the next generation of maritime leaders.\nI shared with the graduates and families several perspectives I\u2019ve gained over the past two and a half years about the maritime ecosystem.\nObservation #1: The maritime ecosystem vitally contributes to national security. Our economy is directly tied to the maritime. And that dependence grows with each passing year. The seas are key to American prosperity. And it is our maritime ecosystem \u2013 the ship-building and repair companies, maritime operating and shipping companies, logistics and transportation companies, and most importantly the talented human capital \u2013 that gives America a competitive edge.\nObservation #2: The maritime operating environment is changing at an exponential rate. There is broad consensus that today\u2019s security environment is faster paced, more complex, and increasingly competitive. Today\u2019s maritime operations cover all domains \u2013 from the ocean floor to geosynchronous orbit; from the high seas to the littorals; even cyberspace. The relative freedom of navigation we enjoyed over the past 50 years across all domains has ended. Today we witness growing naval strength and belligerent actions by state and non-state actors alike. For those of us working in the maritime industry, our charge is to swiftly adapt to the new operating environment. It is imperative that we account for these current and emerging challenges so that we remain relevant as an industry and strong as a nation.\nObservation #3: The maritime ecosystem is composed of talented and courageous professionals. The global delivery and sustainment of food, fuel, and supplies is achieved by a complex logistics \u201csystem of systems\u201d that must be assured. With the return to great power competition and the expansion of Grey War activity, Mariners sailing today face increasing adversity and possible grave consequences. U.S. Mariners have proven they will be there, reliably and bravely manning our ships \u2014 even if the seas become a battlefield. In addition, our nation is fortunate to have on deck recent graduates from our maritime academies and union schools who are eager to carry on the proud tradition of the U.S. Merchant Marine.\nOur Mariners and ashore staff are the tie between the strategic importance of the maritime and this new operating environment. Working together with a shared sense of purpose to collaboratively overcome obstacles is how we will adapt to today\u2019s changing world. The important work we are doing today will enable MSC to provide global assured logistics, sealift, and special services to the joint warfighter in any environment we may encounter.\nThank you for the work you are doing every day at MSC."}

Joe Barton had it wrong.\nLast week, oil company executives testified to Congress about energy policy in the wake of BP\u2019s ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. A casual observer may have thought we were transported to an alternate universe. At one session, Representative Joe Barton of Texas apologized to BP for what he called a White House \u201cshakedown\u201d (because President Obama demanded a $20 billion escrow account from BP to ensure that damage claims will be paid). Mr. Barton didn\u2019t just get his politics wrong, he got the petroleum-powered math all fouled up too.\nAs suggested in this blog two weeks ago and by many others since, BP may face bankruptcy over this debacle when it goes to court with victims all the way from the Gulf to New England for a growing list of damages. The President\u2019s escrow account is a prudent measure to ensure that at least some victims are compensated. But \u201cshakedown\u201d could apply to what the oil industry has done to the American taxpayer for decades.\nIn a recent ten year period, for example, oil companies lavished Congress with nearly $200 million in campaign contributions and reaped one hundred times that figure from the US Treasury in return. Perhaps Representative Barton was himself a \u201cvictim\u201d, shaken down to defend the industry in exchange for the reported million dollars in contributions to his own political campaigns.\nWhat else did Big Oil get from this kind of political shakedown? Direct tax breaks like the \u201cdepletion allowance\u201d (oil companies can write off diminishing oil reserves, which they obviously did nothing to create in the first place); defending oil around the globe (the Iraq war alone now exceeds $1 trillion and thousand of lives); and health care costs related to inhaling toxins from petroleum and combusted oil that are astonishingly similar to smoking-related illnesses and deaths, to name just a few.\nMany have called for ending these absurd subsidies at a time when we need to diversify our energy mix and specifically reduce oil consumption in the face of global competition for a diminishing natural resource and the growing concerns over climate change. In fact, it was that topic which provided the other Alice in Wonderland moment in Congress last week.\nConoco-Phillips CEO Jim Mulva called on Congress to impose a price on carbon. While other oil execs defended their taxpayer-subsidized wealth and boasted that they would never have made the mistakes that led to the Deepwater Horizon blowout, Mulva spent the bulk of his testimony to call on the federal government to \u201cestablish a clear and transparent price for carbon.\u201d Essentially, he was asking to be taxed or to have carbon fees imposed through a cap-and-trade system, which are the two primary ways of accomplishing his request, sort of a reverse shakedown.\nNor is this anything new for Mr. Mulva. In 2008, he and I were part of a team of energy advisors who debated these issues for then-Senator Obama and he strongly advocated then for stable markets that featured a predictable price on carbon. Sadly, he is alone in the oil industry, as his brethren continue to deny the problem and delay solutions. Although the House has passed legislation to do what Mr. Mulva suggests on carbon, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seems intent on scuttling a cap-and-trade bill for now, locked in a tight race for reelection and unlikely to take up controversial issues before the November elections.\nSo the oil industry continues to shakedown the US taxpayer for subsidies; make at least one"}

Mr. Pak described ''Three Hallucinations'' as a difficult piece: ''It keeps me on my toes,'' he said. The first section, ''Sacrifice,'' depicts the slaying of a seven-eyed goat. ''Hymn,'' the second section, has fragments of the hymn ''Rock of Ages,'' and ''Ritual'' is an Indian mushroom dance.\nBerlioz was known to indulge in opium, and some of his works, including the ''Symphonie Fantastique,'' are said to reflect the altered state deriving from that substance's use. Rey M. Longyear, the author of a book on romanticism in music, wrote that ''Berlioz paints a better picture of hell than any other composer.'' Indeed, the March to the Gallows scene in ''Symphonie Fantastique'' culminates with the chop of the guillotine, the head falling into the basket, and the cheers of the crowd.

{"idx": "4327", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Nobody spotted the rise of populism, say the media and the politicians, but that\u2019s not entirely true when it comes to folk music, writes Toner Quinn, Editor of The Journal Of Music. There is a case to be made for listening much more carefully to the music around us.\nEver since the new RT\u00c9 Folk Awards were launched in May, I\u2019ve been thinking about what \u2018folk music\u2019 means to audiences now. Up until recently, the phrase \u2018traditional music\u2019 was the prevalent one in Ireland because the word \u2018folk\u2019 had become so commercialised in the 60s and 70s that Irish musicians had moved away from it.\nBut now \u2018folk\u2019 is back, influenced by its popularity in the UK and the USA, and the term is used to describe an ever widening range of musics, from indie-folk to atmos-folk. It would be easy for its meaning to get entirely lost. And yet there are things happening in the world right now that should remind us of one of the most important characteristics of folk music, and compel us to listen to it much more carefully.\nOne of the reasons \u2018folk\u2019 has been caught up in so many social and political movements for change over the decades is because of the economics of the music. Folk is pared-down music; it\u2019s mainly played in pubs and at modest-sized festivals; it doesn\u2019t sell like other musics; it doesn\u2019t have the big performance infrastructure to absorb a lot of funding; and it doesn\u2019t scale economically like pop, rock and classical music and opera do.\nEven when folk singers become quite well known, they are still playing in small venues and festivals up and down the country; still playing acoustic music in small ensembles because that\u2019s the folk idiom; and often performing in sessions and concerts, and on television and radio, for free. Because of these economics, folk singers are usually very grounded in the communities in which they play, and they often perform or write songs that capture the challenges facing those communities. When folk music reaches a wider audience, therefore, it can contain a picture of ordinary people\u2019s experience of society, the kind of reality that can\u2019t be squeezed into news website headlines, tweets and political discussions on television.\nWe have heard a lot of public discussion over the past few years, saying that nobody saw Brexit coming; nobody saw Trump coming; nobody foresaw the rise of right-wing politics \u2013 but that\u2019s not entirely true when it comes to folk music. English folk musicians sensed the shift early on and set up an organisation called Folk Against Fascism in 2009, just after the economic crash, because they were concerned at folk music being manipulated by the British National Party.\nIt wasn\u2019t called the rise of populism then, but, clearly, that\u2019s what it was. Similarly, even earlier, on the album Rough Music in 2005, the English folk singer Eliza Carthy was singing about \u2018a shift to the right\u2019 with Billy Bragg\u2019s song, King James Version. I can remember listening to that line, and there was a power to it that seemed to capture the intensity and blindness of the economic boom and its self-referential logic.\nIt\u2019s rare that a folk singer articulates what is happening in this way. Generally, they address issues by either re-interpreting the songs of the past, or they write new material in a folk idiom. Wood was doing both. His album the same year, The Lark Descending \u2013 in direct opposition to Vaughan Williams\u2019 The Lark Ascending \u2013 gives clues into this \u2018cultural disarray\u2019. On his song Alb"}

The county ranked 23 for toxic releases among all United States counties included in the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. Indiana ranked sixth for overall pounds of toxic chemical releases but first in terms of total toxic chemicals released per square mile.\nCompany president Greg Merle said the process would use heat and pressure to liquify pulverized coal, adding hydrogen to create the fuel. About 1.6 million tons of coal a year would fuel the process. It would produce an estimated 4.8 million barrels of diesel fuel and 2.5 million barrels of naphtha (used in making plastics, solvents and gasoline). Sulfur removed during the process also would be marketable, Merle said.\n\"Everything produced by the process is marketable. No waste will be stored on site. Everything it produces we can sell and use,\" Merle said.\nThe ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel the process would produce would have even less sulfur content than the 15 parts per million mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Merle said.\nSince Dec. 1, 2010, the federal government has required that all diesel fuel sold in the U.S. be ultra-low sulfur diesel.\nHowever, he acknowledged that there are no similar facilities operating in the United States to compare it to. He said the project development is being privately financed but would not rule out seeking a government loan or funding in the future.\n\"I think the whole thing is bogus. It's an experiment,\" said John Blair, president of the Evansville-based environmental organization Valley Watch.\nHe criticized the pace of the project for skipping steps in development that would allow for a demonstration process to iron out potential bugs.\nThe Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) is reviewing Riverview Energy's air pollution permit for the project.\nThe application indicates the facility would emit carbon dioxide \u2014 one of several greenhouse gases linked to global warming and climate change \u2014 at a rate of 2.2 million tons per year.\nAnnual emission rates for other federally-regulated pollutants, according to the application, would be: Nitrogen dioxide, 184 tons; carbon monoxide, 255 tons; sulfur dioxide, 120 tons; 56 tons of fine particulates; 139 tons of volatile organic chemicals and 32 tons of hazardous air pollutants.\nMerle calls those figures \"precautionary\" limits and said the plant would not actually emit up to those levels.\nBrady Hagerty, an IDEM spokesman, said those numbers are the maximum a facility would be allowed to emit.\nMerle said the technological process itself is a closed-loop system that would have minimal emissions.\n\"This whole process is"}

Though Remix might seem priced out of its league, it is actually two games in one. The first, the original Galaga, will stoke the memories of long nights staying up blasting odd-looking space creatures, while the Remix has upgraded visuals and a much more smooth movement system. Both games can be controlled by sliding your finger or using the accelerometer, and it\u2019s evident that time was spent to makes these games more than just simple ports"}

Bush, who stumped for a \u201chumble foreign policy.\u201d Gore had voted for the first Iraq war, encouraged congressional efforts to step up the pressure to oust Saddam Hussein, and chose as his would-be vice president Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a fellow war Democrat.\nSure, Gore employed some canned populist rhetoric. What Democrat doesn\u2019t claim to side with The People against The Powerful at some point? But on foreign and non-green domestic issues, the Tennessean was quite a ways from being an orthodox liberal.\nGore supported the death penalty, had impeccable free trade credentials and was interested in \u201creinventing government\u201d initiatives that outsourced many civil service jobs to private contractors. He put forward a savings-matching plan to help reform Social Security that was endorsed by some on the right. National Review\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru argued that the vice president\u2019s plan was, in parts, slightly more free-market-oriented than what Bush was proposing.\nIf Gore could come that close to winning on what we could call a New Democrat agenda, why, in 2004 and again in 2008, has his party abandoned this and instead put forward progressively more liberal nominees?\nLast time, the \u00fcberliberal Sen. John F. Kerry had to fight off the more radical challenger Howard Dean. This time, the very liberal Barack Obama bested Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was forced to run far, far to the left of her husband\u2019s record.\nDean now wields more influence than Kerry from his perch as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Poor Lieberman has been cast out of his old party for refusing to change. What caused this shift?\nIt can be explained in two words \u2014 though be forewarned, they\u2019re fighting words to some: Ralph Nader.\nWhat? You were expecting George Bush?\nIt\u2019s tempting to claim that Bush radicalized the Democrats, but it\u2019s simply not a convincing explanation. Bill Clinton had become the first Democratic president since FDR to be elected to two terms. He did that by convincing voters that his was that rare middle ground between bleeding-heart liberals in his party and those heartless Republicans.\nThe consumer crusader and activist Nader had run for president before, but in 2000 he ran hard against Clintonism on the Green Party ticket. Nader was sick of the triangulation. He wanted to topple the nation\u2019s \u201ccorporate paymasters,\u201d raise taxes, socialize medicine, reregulate everything that moves, kill free trade agreements, and not only strengthen unions but return them to their old place of prominence in the American work force. He actually talked of repealing the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act."}

But if the stock trader relies on misinformation to manipulate the stock price, it\u2019s known as \u201cshort-and-distort\u201d trick.\nThe stock price for Amazon had started to fall last Friday, most likely in response to the technical issues experienced by their website. The trend continued on Monday and I would not be surprised if the spam campaign had made it worse.\nThe \u201cpump-n-dump\u201d spam was taking advantage of \u201cpenny\u201d stocks and was going after small companies.

The only problem: she may have purchased the winning ticket with her co-workers, and now she doesn\u2019t want to share.\nWilson, a single mother of seven children, admits that she did contribute to the McDonald\u2019s \u201coffice\u201d pool, but swears that she purchased the winning ticket separately with her own cash. \u201cWe had a group plan, but I went and played by myself. [The \u2018winning\u2019 ticket] wasn\u2019t on the group plan,\u201d Wilson told the New York Post, insisting she alone bought one of the three tickets that will split the record $656 million payout.\nHer co-workers disagree. Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the pool told the Post, \u201cWe each paid $5. She took everybody\u2019s money!\u201d Further corroborating Husein\u2019s version was a man identified by the Post only as Allen, who was also part of the pool. He said Wilson bought tickets for the group at the 7-Eleven in Milford Mill, which is where the winning ticket was sold.\nIf the allegations against her are true, Wilson would not be the first member of a lottery-winning office pool to try to fleece her coworkers. In 2009, Americo Lopes cashed a $35 million winning lottery ticket that five former colleagues claimed he had purchased with money from their combined contributions. But unlike Wilson, who called her co-workers to boast that she (and she alone) had won, Lopes kept quiet, and it took several months for his co-workers to realize what had happened. Just a few weeks ago, a jury ordered Lopes to divide the winnings, as reported in the New York Times.\nAs of the time of publication, Wilson had not yet produced the winning ticket to the lottery office. And there is some cause to doubt that she won. According to Yohannes Michael, a clerk at the 7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets, who spoke to the New York Post, lottery officials had reviewed the store\u2019s video and believe that a man bought the winning ticket. However, lottery rep Carole Everett would not confirm that to the Post.\nIf Wilson did win, she will take home an after-tax lump sum of $105 million, or $5.59 million a year for 26 years."}

{"idx": "4345", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers \u2014 Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game.\nAs I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro. But the major leagues seemed a very long way off.\nMeyer, who pitched for the University of Minnesota, was a 29th round pick in the 2015 draft. He was doing okay for Greensboro, but pitching okay at the Low A level doesn\u2019t portend a major league career.\nNonetheless, both Richards and Meyer made the majors this year.\nRichards\u2019 season has been up and down. Literally. He began the season with Miami, was sent down to Triple A New Orleans, and is now back with the Marlins in their starting rotation.\nToday, Richards was the starting pitcher for the Marlins in their game against the Washington Nationals in D.C. I attended.\nRichards\u2019 fast ball comes in at around 91 miles per hour, which is below the major league average. His go-to pitch is a change-up that was clocked today at around 84 mph.\nThe change-up baffled the Nationals hitters, but Richards couldn\u2019t control it. He walked seven batters (one intentionally) in three-and-two-thirds innings. On the plus side, five of the 11 outs he recorded were strikeouts.\nRichards\u2019 control problem today wasn\u2019t an anomaly. For the big league season, he\u2019s now walked 29 batters in just under 57 innings. That won\u2019t cut it.\nHowever, last season in the minors, Richards walked only 30 batters in 146 innings, and he walked just four in 39 innings this year at New Orleans. So he\u2019s not inherently wild.\nWhen his lack of control got him into trouble today, Richards had to rely on his fastball more than I imagine he liked. Bad control and a 91 mph fastball can be a recipe for disaster.\nToday, however, the Nats were in a forgiving mood, as they often have been this season. Washington scored only two runs off of Richards (and just two for the day). The Marlins won 10-2, but Richards didn\u2019t pitch long enough to be credited with the win. It would have been his third at the big league level.\nI was hoping for either a Nats win or a strong performance by Richards (or, ideally, both). I got neither. However, it was a perfect day for baseball and I enjoyed seeing Richards pitch. (Tanner Roark of the Nats, not so much).\nBen Meyer pitched mop-up relief against the Nationals the night before. It was his fifth appearance for the Marlins, all in relief. I didn\u2019t attend the game and had turned it off by the time Meyer mopped up in an 18-4 Nationals victory. The numbers say that Meyer"}

{"idx": "4352", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Impinj, Inc. has announced the availability of the Speedway Revolution (News - Alert) reader that incorporates Impinj\u2019s Autopilot technology to deliver new standards in RFID reader performance, versatility and cost of ownership. Impinj, Inc. develops UHF Gen 2 RFID solutions for both item-level and supply-chain tagging.\nSpeedway Revolution builds on the reputation of the original Speedway reader. It is 80 percent smaller than the original Speedway reader, consumes less than half the power and has a 20 percent lower MSRP. The features present in the Speedway reader include Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and support for the standard application interface and EPCglobal Low-Level Reader Protocol. In addition, Speedway Revolution provides low cost of ownership and also integrates easily with RFID middleware platforms.\nThe patented Autopilot technology from Impinj is critical to Speedway Revolution's outstanding performance and ease of use. The Autopilot technology will continuously and automatically optimize the reader for its operating environment to deliver peak performance at all times. Since RFID system performance depends upon a number of ever-changing environmental conditions, users configure readers for worst-case scenarios and thereby compromise on optimum performance. The Autopilot technology guarantees peak performance while eliminating the need for manual tuning by integrating several features.\nThe Autopilot technology contains a feature named Autoset, which continuously optimizes the reader's configuration for the most reliable performance. Speedway Revolution readers will automatically select the appropriate settings by sensing levels of RF noise and interference. Another feature integrated in the Autopilot is low duty cycle, which reduces RF interference, power consumption and energy costs. Speedway Revolution readers eliminate unnecessary RF noise by transmitting only when tags are in the field of view. Dynamic antenna switching, which improves throughput and efficiency is another feature integrated into the Autopilot. Speedway Revolution readers will sense where tags are in the field and automatically focus more time on antennas with the largest tag (News - Alert) populations in view.\nAccording to Kerry Krause, vice president of marketing at Impinj, while end-users need RFID systems to deliver great performance in dynamic environments, they also look for easy-to-use and inexpensive readers. The combination of Autopilot along with Revolution's small size and low power consumption provides consistently superior performance, ease of use and significant cost savings for end-users."}

{"idx": "4354", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: WSWS reported that around one hundred coal miners at the Wongawilli mine near Wollongong, an industrial city south of Sydney, began seven-day strike action this morning. The workers are employed as casuals by CAS Mining, on behalf of Wollongong Coal. They are demanding a new enterprise agreement that guarantees job permanency and improved wages. The industrial action expresses growing anger among workers over wage levels, and opposition to a stepped-up offensive against conditions, amid a soaring cost of living.\nIn a sign of nervousness within the ruling elite that the strike could become a focal point for broader discontent, the Murdoch-owned Australian newspaper prominently reported it on Friday. Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the federal Liberal-National Coalition government\u2019s industrial relations minister, called for talks to prevent the stoppage.\nThe Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, however, called the action as part of a cynical attempt to present the unions, which have collaborated in the destruction of full-time jobs for decades, as opponents of growing casualisation. The unions are also seeking to exploit the strike for their campaign to channel workers behind the election of yet another big business federal Labor government.\nThe fraudulent character of the union posturing is underscored by its record at Wongawilli. The CFMMEU has enforced all of management\u2019s dictates and prevented any unified struggle by mine workers against a series of attacks on conditions.\nIn 2015, Wollongong Coal shuttered the Wongawilli site, laying off around 80 permanent workers. The company invoked substantial financial losses to justify the move, amid the downturn in global commodity prices after the 2008 global financial crisis. The shutdown followed a series of sackings at the site and Wollongong Coal\u2019s nearby Russell Vale mine.\nWollongong Coal is a subsidiary of Jindal Group, a diversified resources and manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in India. It has an annual turnover of around USD 18 billion.\nThe union did nothing to prevent the shut-down. It ensured continued production at Wollongong Steel\u2019s other mines in the region. It only issued plaintive appeals that if the mine were reopened, it be staffed by the workers who had been laid-off.\nIn 2016 the company reopened the Wongawilli mine to take advantage of the doubling of commodity prices amid a global rebound in the sector. In order to slash costs, it hired a contract workforce, with fewer rights and entitlements than the previous workforce, and no job permanency.\nLast year, Wollongong Coal outsourced its staffing arrangements at Wongawilli to CAS Mining, a labour hire company. Workers at the site have been employed as casuals, with no sick or leave entitlements, or other benefits of full-time employment. They have been paid hundreds of dollars less per week than workers at other mines in the area.\nAccording to CAS Mining, the workers are paid USD 34 an hour, compared to a rate of USD 42 for permanent employees at nearby mines. Workers have claimed that if they take \u201ctoo many\u201d sick days, for which they are not paid, they no longer receive shifts. The site is an underground mine, involving physically demanding labour.\nThe arrangement, which the unions have done nothing to prevent, is potentially illegal. Under Fair Work industrial legislation, companies can only use casual labour if provisions are contained in an enterprise agreement. CAS Min"}

The truck starts at a shave north of $35,000, delivered. And if that seems ridiculous for a steel-wheeled pickup truck to you, you\u2019re not alone. We see all sorts of new vehicles around here, and increasingly, the first question out of any of our mouths is not, \"how much horsepower does it have?\" but rather, \"What was the sticker?\" That\u2019s where the really shocking numbers tend to lie.\nIt\u2019s not just in our heads, either. Cars have actually gotten more expensive over the past 10 years, and not just by a little bit. Edmunds says that, on average, new cars sold for more than $36,000 in February, up 29 percent from the same month in 2009. Meanwhile, median household income in the US has only risen to around $62,000, an increase of about six percent over the past decade. Even more cringeworthy? Interest rates have also risen in that time period, from an average of five percent to around 6.26 percent. Not only are cars more expensive, but your auto loan will now cost you more money.\nThe Detroit News says all of this could push more buyers to the used market, where there are plenty of solid vehicles available that won\u2019t cost consumers more than half of their annual household income, but used car prices have crept up right alongside their new-vehicle counterparts, increasing by a staggering 36 percent to $24,499 from $17,980 in 2009.\nHow has this happened? Cars are nicer than they were 10 years ago. They\u2019re faster, more efficient, safer, quieter, and laden with more tech than ever before, and all of those things cost money. They\u2019re also responses to consumer demands, which is why when you start comparing mid-sized truck MSRPs, you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re all within $1,000 of each other once you check the same option boxes. That doesn\u2019t make them any more affordable, though.\nSubprime auto loans, or notes given to borrowers with a FICO score of 620 or below, are also partially to blame for the steady increase in car prices. According to The Financial Times, subprime auto loans represent one of the few consumer credit categories to see a sharp increase over the past year. Easy money means it\u2019s easy to brush off the eye-widening numbers at the bottom of your loan documents.\nBut as a result, the Federal Reserve Bank says that as of the end of 2018, some seven million Americans were 90 days or more past due on their car loans. That\u2019s an increase of around one million from the year before, and it\u2019s more than ever in the history of the car. The Financial Times says default rates have risen the sharpest among borrowers under 30, followed closely by 30-39 year-olds.\nIf this feels familiar, it should. The mortgage industry followed a very similar path, one that led to a spectacular economic collapse. That\u2019s less likely to happen here, as auto loans represent a much smaller portion of the country\u2019s economy, around $300 billion, but it\u2019s no less worrying for the industry, and for buyers who just need a solid car that won\u2019t send them down the road to bankruptcy."}

Rising production costs in the region is also likely to lead to more fundamental pricing reforms.\nThe peak summer demand season in the Middle East has drawn to a close for 2010. However, the region is expected to see a flurry of LNG-related activity over the next couple of months, with both Dubai and Bahrain each seeking to fast-track LNG import plans as part of a strategy to plug a growing gas supply shortfall.\nThe Dubai Supply Authority (DUSUP) is understood to have already made its debut as an LNG importer, having received its first commissioning cargo at the 3 million tonne per annum (mtpa) floating regasification terminal at the Jebel Ali port earlier this month (see GLM 8 October 2010).\nThe commissioning process on the 126,000m3 Golar Freeze, the converted floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), is expected to complete by December or January. This could provide DUSUP with the option to tap the spot market over the winter if needed, and it certainly leaves the state company ontrack ahead of May 2011 when it is expected to start receiving regular term LNG from the Qatargas 4 project.\nIn the meantime, Bahrain is also hoping to join neighbouring Kuwait and Dubai as an LNG importer and is looking to formalise an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) tender for its planned 400 million cubic feet/day (4.13 billion cubic metres (Gm3)/year) terminal in the next week or two, with an award expected early next year.\nBahrain's National Oil and Gas Authority (NOGA) still has to finalise a number of technical aspects for the planed terminal, such as whether to opt for a floating or onshore option. But the overriding aim is to commission the terminal by the final quarter of 2014 in order to avert a growing gas crunch in the Kingdom.\nThe requirement of three of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states - comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - to have to fast-track LNG import plans may at first glance appear to be illogical as the GCC holds around 42.57 trillion cubic metres of proved gas reserves or 22.7% of the world's total reserves, according to BP's 2010 Statistical Review.\nHowever, this figure masks the fact that a decade-long, region-wide boom of government-sponsored programmes to develop large gas-intensive industries, premised on access to cheap feedstock, has led to gas demand in the GCC outpacing virtually every other region in world.\nFrom 1998 through 2008, GCC economies grew at a rate of around 7.6%/year, with demand for gas and power in the region growing at an average of 5.5% and 6.1% respectively.\nThe 2008-2009 global economic recession may have slowed these growth rates - as well as resulting in the mothballing of a number of petrochemical and gas-fired power projects - but consumption is still climbing strongly.\nA study on GCC gas consumption by management consultancy Booz & Co, released this summer, warned that the regional gas shortage is"}

Firstly, the name changed from forum to festival. The dates changed from summer to fall. A theme was added. There was a new logo. There was a new website. Thirty-eight people volunteered. Last year had only two. Marketing and advertising efforts were increased with TV commercials, newspaper inserts and sponsored screenings.\nThe number of films was also expanded. A regular year in the past would feature maybe 12 to 15. This year, the festival had almost 40 films. With foreign film, documentaries, classics, comedies, sci-fi movies and animated features, the goal was to avoid esotericism and attract as many different groups of moviegoers as possible, Smith said. The extra films booked all screens in the Palace Theatre, two rooms in the High Peaks Resort and the theater at the Lake Placid Center for the Arts.\nIt was impossible for ticket buyers to see every film, but there\u2019s some good in that, Smith said. It starts conversations about what films people did and didn\u2019t see.\n\u201cIt makes people want to come back for more next year,\u201d he said.\nCompared to past festivals, this year was well attended, Smith said.\n\u201cFriday night alone outsold the entirety of last year\u2019s event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to have sold six or eight times the all-session passes.\nThe National Geographic rock climbing documentary \u201cFree Solo\u201d had 320 people attend the screening at the LPCA Friday night. The film, which was released at the end of September, has already earned more than $5 million and was written about in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal shortly before its screening in Lake Placid.\nSmith said the adventure crowd in the Adirondacks is lucrative and vibrant and that turnout will likely affect marketing and programming strategies in the future.\nGenerally, screening an independent film costs between $300 and $600. A percentage of ticket sales also goes to the distributor. With such a stacked roster for 2018, the ADK Film Society boosted its grant writing process.\nWhen the festival first started in 2000, it was kind of big deal for Lake Placid. Only a few years later did Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver) and Jon Favreau (Iron Man) show up as guest speakers. However, that was 14 years ago. The landscape has changed and the early 2000s heyday is gone, Smith said. Though he and other members of the ADK Film Society were happy with this year\u2019s festival, they acknowledge it\u2019s still a learning process. Gary said he\u2019d like to get things like booking guests speakers, creating the film lineup and sending out invitations done much earlier for the 2019 LPFF."}

So it is both ironic and infuriating that it has now been defamed because of the (I would argue false) notion that it isn't nice enough to a really powerful white guy who plays a key supporting role. More importantly, it is a rare big movie, even if it was merely a $20 million independently financed production, which comes from the lens of a female African-American filmmaker. We are just now getting to a point where Warner Bros./ Time Warner Inc. felt properly pressured (or logically inclined) to hire a female director to direct a Wonder Woman movie. We are just at the point where we have male black filmmakers like Lee Daniels and Steve McQueen crafting very important movies about black characters and/or black-centric historical events. We've even got Tim Story crafting franchises for Kevin Hart and Ice Cube. It\u2019s a very tiny piece of progress, but it is thus-far male-centric in nature."}

Our goal is to publish a range of perspectives on these very heated topics. Add your feedback and story suggestions here.\nThe ideal shot was aimed not at the squirrel, but at the tree branch directly below it, so that the animal would be killed by the concussion of the bullet instead of the bullet itself. Historians say that this is what won the Revolutionary war; even the most highly trained British soldiers were no match for squirrel killers trained by hunger.\nUntil recent decades, Americans ate squirrel meat because it was cheap, plentiful, and there, according to Hank Shaw, author of Hunt, Gather, Cook: Finding the Forgotten Feast. Domesticated animals may have been easier to catch, but, in the days before the industrialization of farming, they were expensive to raise and feed. \u201cWhen Herbert Hoover promised a chicken in every pot, that was a big deal,\u201d Shaw adds. The first edition of The Joy of Cooking, published in 1931, was heavy on the squirrel. As it moved into later and later editions, Hoover\u2019s promise was fulfilled (by other politicians, if not Hoover himself) and chicken gradually replaced squirrel.\nShaw shot his first squirrel when he was working as a reporter for a daily paper in Minnesota. He\u2019d made it through an underpaid stint as a cub reporter in Long Island by catching and eating his own fish. When he arrived in Minnesota, though, he could not help but take note of the squirrels. The state has such a vibrant squirrel scene that a cottage industry has grown up around trapping and removing ones that have moved into people\u2019s homes. Shaw bought a few books about squirrel hunting off the internet, applied for a license to hunt them, and got to it.\nIn doing so, he placed himself on the vanguard of the re-squirreling of the American diet. Squirrel-eating has been trendy in Great Britain for half a decade now \u2014 spurred by a nationalistic fervor to kill as many as possible of the invasive American gray squirrel, which is outcompeting the domestic red squirrel (the latter had the good fortune to star in a Beatrix Potter book, one of the best ways to cement your status as charismatic megafauna).\nThe shift has left the squirrel hunting to the immigrant populations like the Hmong, who hunt squirrels in America because they\u2019re the closest thing to the ones they hunted in the mountains of Southeast Asia. And it\u2019s left them to people like Shaw \u2014 idealists who believe that, if you\u2019re going to eat meat, it\u2019s more noble (and thrifty) to kill whatever protein happens to be closest to home.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine more sustainable local game \u2014 squirrels are abundant, far from endangered, and don\u2019t even require refrigeration the way that big game does. The standard rule of thumb is that one squirrel = enough meat for one dinner for one person. The squirrel is road food \u2014 the kind of prey that fed cross-country hikers, in the days before MRE and freeze-dried lentils. Squirrel is like the drive-through cheeseburger of the forest \u2014 albeit a cheeseburger that needs to be gutted first.\nBiologically speaking, the squirrel family is an"}

In 2013, the Chicago Bears went to the Canadian Football League and hired Marc Trestman. He was a disaster. In 2007, late Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis turned over his franchise to a 31-year-old college assistant coach named Lane Kiffin. He was a disaster. In 1995, the New York Jets gave its head coach and general manager jobs to a freshly fired Rich Kotite.\nThere are many more examples of irresponsible teams telegraphing hires destined to fail, but Kingsbury is the misguided obsession du jour. Six weeks ago, Texas Tech, his alma mater, fired Kingsbury after he posed a 35-40 record and made just three bowl appearances in six seasons. On Tuesday, the Arizona Cardinals hired him - as their head coach. Not their offensive coordinator. Their head coach.\nIgnore that smudge on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because there's a slight chance he could be the next Sean McVay. In a copycat league, finding the next McVay is the newest whim.\nWhile Kingsbury didn't show he can win and command an entire locker room in Lubbock, Texas, he's a handsome 39-year-old with a magnetic personality who can draw up pretty plays, develop quarterbacks and score 40 points per game at the college level.\nThe in-demand status of Kingsbury, who also was interviewed by the Jets, is a symptom of the NFL's reckless and illogical hiring practices and an example of why the league will never have real diversity - not just racial, but diversity of strategy and styles of play.\nKingsbury is now the poster child for failing up. For certain, he has a clever offensive mind, but after losing his job at Texas Tech, he would have been wise to take a step back, work as an offensive coordinator and rebuild his reputation. USC had hired him last month to run its offense, and that only made pro teams thirstier for his services. It would have made sense if there had been a pro and college bidding war for his play-calling services. For an NFL team, that would have been a safer way to keep up with the McVays.\nBut to have Kingsbury run the whole show? Why? To win a news conference or gain temporary relevance by making a questionable decision that sparks national debate? These are the lengths to which NFL teams will go in order to avoid giving greater consideration to minority candidates or coaches who are simply in the minority, regardless of their race, because they are humble NFL lifers and grinders who specialize in defense or special teams or any other job less glamorous than decorating the scoreboard.\nIn December, NFL owners made the surprise announcement that the league would strengthen the Rooney Rule, which obligates teams to interview minority candidates when making coaching and executive hires. Among the notable revisions to the rule, the league is taking measures that attempt to end the practice of sham interviews, which teams often do when they already have identified a preferred candidate. And the NFL is sharing the Fritz Pollard Alliance's career development advisory panel list with teams to assist them in targeting coaches who should be considered for better jobs during each hiring cycle.\nAfter the annual round of coaching firings, eight of the league's 32 head coaching positions came open. There are currently three minority head coaches: Anthony Lynn and Mike Tomlin, who are black; and Ron Rivera, who is Latino. With Arizona hiring Kings"}

Everything from LGBTQ to abandonment, child abuse, neglect, prostitution, sexual molestation and runaway after runaway are crushing our families and family values.\nToo many people are forgetting what a real relationship should be about and that creates cycles we cannot afford to have in our communities. We also cannot afford to get offended and live in denial when we are told the truth about problems and solutions. It\u2019s time to restore the family by first rebuilding the relationships between our men and women on solid foundations instead of self-centered, wayward confusion or whatever feels right.\nSo what qualifies me to hare this information with you? I have done the theological, psychological and sociological research. I have been trained to help others build strong relationships and I have done just that a thousand times over for decades as a marriage, family and relationship counselor. I am in a strong marriage relationship. I have seen strong relationships such as the one my parents displayed for 54 years. But remember, you and/or your partner may not have seen the same \u2013 and that\u2019s OK. Both of you will need to recognize the differences in what you have seen, grown up with and experienced.\nEach person generally tries to subconsciously recreate his or her \u201cnormal\u201d based on what he or she saw growing up. And if the two of you saw two completely different types of relationships, just know that is an issue you both will need to address together. Never assume what you were taught was the only way, the 100% right way or even the best way for you and your partner. Maybe so or maybe not. But such is worth examining together as a couple and with open minds and hearts toward each other.\nBefore we go on, though it may offend some of you, I have to say this article is for building and rebuilding strong African American male/female relationships. That includes marriage relationships, those engaged and serious dating relationships with a future. If you are LGBTQ I cannot help you with the advice in this article. If you are a player, a user, an control freak, an abuser or a little boy or little girl, I cannot help you with this article because the advice herein requires sincere effort as well as mature approach. If you want the stability, beauty, passion, fulfillment, uniqueness and productivity of a real relationship as it was intended to be from the beginning, this article is for you.\nA great relationship between an African American man and woman, if it is to both succeed and set the right example, should consist of at least the following 12 elements. If they seem difficult, welcome to the reality of building a phenomenal relationship. If they seem like Hell, too much or impossible, you are not ready, you are with the wrong person or both.\nShare what you are thinking and feeling but always respectfully. Holding things back until an argument arises is foolish and unproductive. Plus it builds up tension and fuels anger leading to resentment. Your partner should not have to try and read your mind. You have a mouth and a voice to communicate so do it. And never assume that your partner should have known when you could have simply spoken up.\nFar too often men and women stand before God and lie to Him and each other.

(AP) \u2014 Joe Thornton\u2019s contributions to the San Jose Sharks in last year\u2019s playoff series against Vegas were limited to pregame warmups and leadership.\nAfter being hampered by knee injuries the past two postseasons, Thornton is healthy to start the playoffs this year for the first time since leading the Sharks on a run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2016. San Jose opens the first round Wednesday night against the Golden Knights in a rematch of a second-round series won by Vegas in six games last year.\nThornton missed the first two games of the 2017 playoffs before returning to play the final four of a first-round loss despite having a torn ACL in his left knee. He then missed the entire postseason with a torn ACL in his right knee last year.\nThe 39-year-old Thornton enters the postseason playing his best hockey of the season, with his 33 points since Jan. 7 ranking third on the team in that span.\nThornton\u2019s play has given the Sharks three top centers, along with Logan Couture and Tomas Hertl, after being thin down the middle last year. While the top two lines get most of the attention from the opposition, Thornton has created consistent offense with wingers Kevin Labanc and Marcus Sorensen.\nA healthy Thornton isn\u2019t going to be the only difference when these teams meet in the playoffs for a second straight year. The Sharks also added star defenseman Erik Karlsson in a trade before the season and another skilled forward at the trade deadline in Gustav Nyquist.\nThe Golden Knights added an entirely new second line that is talented enough to be the top group on many teams. Vegas signed Paul Stastny as a free agent in July, acquired Max Pacioretty in a deal with Montreal in September and then got the big piece that sparked the season at the trade deadline with a deal for Mark Stone.\nKARLSSON\u2019S HEALTH: Karlsson missed 17 games with his second groin injury of the season before returning with some rust for the regular-season finale. San Jose hopes he can shake that rust quickly and get the team back to the form it had in December and January before the first injury happened and the Sharks were playing as well as anyone. Coach Peter DeBoer called Karlsson a critical piece who helps on both ends of the ice.\nIN BLOOM: Perhaps the biggest difference in last year\u2019s series was the play of Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who had two shutouts and a .935 save percentage in the series.

Most of the undocumented in the DR come from Haiti.\nThe undocumented Haitian immigrants can be divided into two categories.

During the first half of the forecast period, from 2013 through 2017, some 156,561 units will be produced; the 2018-2022 timeframe should see production of 139,475 units.\n\"Despite the drawdown of troops in Iraq and the reduction of forces in Afghanistan, high demand for EO systems will see only a slight decline over the next few years,\" said Forecast International's senior defense analyst Andrew Dardine. \"Profound security challenges are a seemingly permanent feature of both nations.\" Iraq in particular is now a major purchaser of U.S. technology and likely will be for some time. The Pentagon in August 2013 notified the U.S. Congress of a possible $2.7 billion arms deal to Iraq that would include air defense, surveillance systems, and other advanced technology.\nSome of the leading EO technology in Forecast International's analysis is critical to the performance of a wide variety of platforms. The next several years should see steady production of the Raytheon-produced VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE). This production will be spread among other services in the U.S. military, including the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Special Operations Command. Raytheon is also at work completing a $25.4 million contract for the Foreign Military Sale of the DVE to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Work under the contract is expected to be completed by April 2014.\nNight Vision devices will also continue to see high demand in the years ahead. Driven by ongoing demand by the U.S. Army for a wide range of advanced surveillance systems, the PSQ-20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG) will be produced in relatively steady numbers through the rest of the decade. The U.S. Army in May 2013 awarded prime contractor ITT Exelis a $48 million contract for the system. According to the FY14 U.S. defense budget, $1.1 billion will be spent on the procurement of night vision devices through 2018.\nOver the next several years, as navies continue to shift their focus from defense from airborne attack alone (whether from missiles or jet fighters) to an emphasis on the surveillance and targeting of small sea-based threats, developers of sea-based EO systems will follow suit. L-3 KEO, for example, in August 2013 was awarded a $9.7 million cost-plus-fixed-fee basic ordering agreement for engineering and logistics services, refurbishment, overhaul, and upgrade in support of the Mk 46 Optical Sight System and the Mk 20 Electro-Optical Sensor components and subcomponents."}

Just this morning, I was sorting coupons and explaining to my daughter that we throw away the ones for things that they don't sell at the commissary, because our overseas AAFES exchange doesn't accept expired coupons. Overseas Commissaries accept coupons for six months past their expiration. As a result, there are entire volunteer groups who send expired coupons to overseas military bases. This is a tremendous help to those of us who don't have any other access to coupons and are trying to save on our food bills. Since these lovely volunteers don't know what the commissaries carry, and often don't have much information about the program as a whole, we get a good number of coupons for things that we can't get or items not stocked at the commissary, such as makeup and other non-food items.\nIn the past, there has been confusion and misinformation about whether overseas Exchanges accepted expired coupons in the same way as overseas Commissary stores. The clear answer was that neither the Navy Exchange (NEX) or AAFES accepted expired coupons. Well, not anymore! I was sitting in the bowling alley today, eating a sandwich before doing my shopping, and the Armed Forces Network station playing had a commercial for the AAFES coupon policy. It clearly stated that overseas AAFES locations could accept coupons for six months past their expiration date.\nShazaam!

Coli Crisis; Is it Enough?\nThe company has been aggressive in responding to the foodborne illness outbreaks, which sent sales -- and its stock price -- plunging.\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has paid the price for its two E. coli outbreaks, which forced it to close stores, change safety procedures, and generally work to try to win back public confidence.\nEven though the Centers for Disease Control has said that two outbreaks \"appear to be over\" -- the last new case of someone falling ill from food eaten at the fast-casual Mexican chain happened on Dec. 1 -- that doesn't mean consumers will return quickly. The public was clearly spooked by the outbreaks, the larger of which led to 55 infected people in 11 states, 21 of whom were hospitalized.\nWith fearful customers staying away, the company reported that comparable restaurant sales fell nearly 15% in the fourth quarter, which caused a revenue drop of 6.8% for the period. The company was upfront about the cause of its sales woes in its earnings release.\n\"We are pleased to have this behind us and can place our full energies to implementing our enhanced food safety plan that will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety,\" said co-CEO Steve Ells. \"We are extremely focused on executing this program, which designs layers of redundancy and enhanced safety measures to reduce the food safety risk to a level as near to zero as is possible.\"\nBut Chipotle is clearly taking the issue seriously and has gone to unprecedented lengths to not only stop it from happening again, but also to reassure the public.\nSince the beginning of the first outbreak, Chipotle has been aggressive and forthcoming in addressing it. The company closed stores in affected markets for deep cleaning, and it moved quickly to implement new food safety procedures. Chipotle even did something that few restaurants ever voluntarily do -- it closed every store across the United States on Feb. 8, during the lunch rush, to hold a companywide meeting to discuss the changes.\nThe company described its new food safety program as \"the product of a comprehensive reassessment of its food safety practices.\" Chipotle, according to a press release, worked with industry-leading experts to assess the safety risks of every ingredient on its menu \"with an eye toward establishing the highest standards for safety.\"\nHigh-resolution DNA-based testing of many ingredients before they are shipped to Chipotle locations, which \"far exceeds requirements of state and federal regulatory agencies, as well as industry standards,\" according to the company.\nChanges to food preparation and handling practices, including changing how some items are washed, as well as shredding cheese before it reaches the stores. In addition, some produce items will now be blanched (dipped quickly into boiling water), and there are new rules for marinating chicken and steak.\nNew internal training on safety standards for all workers.\nPaid sick leave designed to ensure that ill employees stay home when they are sick.\nIn addition to all of these changes and the enhanced procedures and training, the company also plans to spend up to $10 million to help local farms meet its food safety standards, and to make more local ingredients available across the country.\nAt some point, nearly every restaurant chain suffers some sort of food-poisoning incident, but most do not suffer as much as Chipotle.

Mistiming your move can lead to a potentially catastrophic crash. That\u2019s why Volvo\u2014which wants to eliminate fatalities and injuries in its cars by 2020\u2014built its new XC90 SUV to automatically apply the brakes if the driver turns in front of an oncoming car.\nCars have had crash detection systems for a while now, but this is the first time sensors and software have been applied to the left-turn scenario (it also works when you\u2019re going right, so English and Japanese drivers need not worry).\nThe feature is obviously valuable for city driving, and is also meant to prevent accidents at high-speed intersections where cars have little time to brake or swerve to avoid an impact. If you\u2019re turning left on an undivided highway where cars are driving 60 mph, the DOT recommends you wait until any oncoming cars are at least 500 feet away. That\u2019s difficult when your line of sight is blocked, or when it\u2019s tricky to judge fellow motorists\u2019 speed.\nAutomatic braking is just one invention in a quiet parade of features moving Volvo toward its no deaths, no injuries goal. The new XC90, the brand\u2019s flagship model set to be unveiled next month, will come fully loaded. There\u2019s Safe Positioning, which senses if, for example, the car leaves the road surface and heads into a median or ditch, in which case it tightens the seat belts. Rear-facing radars sense oncoming rear-end collisions, flash the hazards, tighten safety belts, and activate the brakes. The Lane Keeping Aid steers the car back into position when the driver drifts over the line. Driver Alert Control uses facial recognition to sense a drowsy driver, and Rest Stop Guidance offers navigation to the nearest rest area.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence all of these take control away from the driver and give it to the car. Automakers are slowly, somewhat subtly making their products more and more autonomous. We may not like the idea of giving up driving, but perhaps it\u2019s time to admit that robots are rapidly getting better at it than we are."}

And anyone who's ever picked up a decent 35-mm camera knows the drinking glass is also half-empty when digital imaging is concerned. In this issue, we review nine of the newest digital cameras, those with 3-megapixel sensors from Canon, Casio, Epson, Kodak, Nikon, Olympus, Ricoh, and Toshiba. They cost up to $1,000 (street) and produce dazzling 8-by-10 enlargements and pretty decent 11-by-14s when the camera captures the picture properly. PC Magazine Labs also tested 2-megapixel cameras to see how much, or how little, users must give up in order to save about $200.\nWeb site imaging. Quick turnaround matters most, so digital cameras win out over film, hands down. Definitely 3- and perhaps even 2-megapixel images are overkill. You could get by with a 1-megapixel camera if you're satisfied with the image quality. The trouble is, the current generations of 2- and 3-megapixel cameras are better at color fidelity, and not that much effort is going into making better 1-megapixel cameras.\nBusiness user. For a company newsletter or visuals for an important meeting, you'll want a high-res camera with a 3X zoom lens capable of shooting in all light conditions. For such applications, the cameras we reviewed are ideal. On the other hand, realty agents, insurance adjusters, and police officers merely need a record of a particular event. Those images don't necessarily need to be saved after the event, and if they're to be uploaded via cellular link smaller sizes may be preferable.\nPersonal user. Sometimes called \"prosumers,\" these users are comfortable with the PC technology that complements digital cameras, particularly for printmaking. They burn through enough traditional film at $15 a roll (with processing) to see how total cost of ownership tips in favor of digital cameras.\nProfessionals. Newspaper and magazine photographers need ruggedness, zero latency, quick cycle time, motors that expose multiple frames per second, flashes that reach out 50 feet, and ultrawide-angle to ultratelephoto lenses. In the studio, they need perfect color fidelity. They're used to paying $1,500 and up for film cameras. When they shop for digital cameras, their market starts at $2,500, and they don't mind the cost because they save so much on film. For them, even the best of the cameras reviewed here are going to fall short of their needs except for so-called grip-and-grin photos that are the stock-in-trade of small-town newspapers.\nThe majority of the cameras we tested looked like traditional 35-mm cameras.

Here are three money-savvy strategies that can round out your portfolio with some tax diversification.\nBeing able to fully fund your 401(k) is no small accomplishment, but it may leave you wondering what other tax-favored savings tools are out there.\nIf you're a high earner who's been diligently building your retirement nest egg, then you may have exhausted the best savings tools at your disposal -- namely, your 401(k), which is where millions of Americans stash the majority of their retirement savings. Tax-advantaged retirement strategies are a little harder to come by when you have a big salary, but fear not -- you can still shield significant sums of savings from taxes.\nHere are three money-savvy strategies that can round out your portfolio with some tax diversification.\nA health savings account, or HSA, is a tax-sheltered account that is designed to help individuals save for current and future healthcare costs. If used correctly, money in an HSA can avoid taxation forever. You can fund an HSA with pre-tax dollars that can grow tax-deferred. Any distributions used for qualified healthcare expenses remain untaxed. If you are under age 65 and withdraw funds for non-medical expenses, you will owe income taxes and get hit with a 20% penalty. But after age 65, funds withdrawn for non-medical purposes will be subject to income taxes only.\nThere are no income limits on who can have an HSA, but in order to contribute to one, you must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). For 2017, your annual health insurance deductible must be at least $1,300 for single coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,550) or $2,600 for family coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $13,100). In addition, you cannot contribute if you're covered by another type of health insurance plan, if you're on Medicare, or if you're claimed as a dependent on someone's tax return.\nAnother key feature of the HSA is that it moves with you even after you leave your job, and any money you contribute to the account can be invested and left to grow year after year. For 2017, you can contribute up to $3,400 to an HSA if you have a high-deductible individual health insurance plan, or up to $6,750 if you have a family plan. And individuals aged 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000 per year. If you're in a position to cover the increased medical expenses that come with having a high-deductible health insurance plan, you can save in an HSA and treat it as another retirement account.\nA Roth IRA is a tax-sheltered retirement account that you fund with after-tax, nondeductible contributions. For 2017, if you are under age 50, you can contribute up to $5,500, and if you are aged 50 or older, you can contribute up to $6,500. Within a Roth IRA, your money can grow untaxed for decades. And, in general, as long as you have the account for at least five years, you can begin taking tax-free qualified distributions at age 59 1/2. This can be"}

To be clear, only one lawsuit has been filed.\nPlacer County Spokesperson DeDe Cordell told the Sun Friday afternoon that the county had not yet received the lawsuit.\nThe development, which earned the approval of both the planning commission and the board of supervisors in two separate hours-long meetings, would essentially replace an asphalt parking lot outside the existing village with 850 new lodging and residential units in addition to a 90,000-square-foot indoor waterpark, among other amenities.\nAs the Sun has previously reported (here, here and here), environmental advocates oppose the redevelopment for a number of reasons, commonly centered on the increase in visitor traffic, and therefore vehicles, it will bring to the region."}

He nailed the falsetto parts, made the dancing look easy and played keyboards and guitar.\nThe staging represented a marvel of concert engineering, featuring three satellite stages connected by a meandering catwalk. Timberlake and his troupe of dancers made use of every inch, often moving in intricate choreographed sequences that recalled the footwork of the boy-band era.\nThe 10-member band that backed them was impressive, too, with members on horns, percussion, keyboards, guitars and backup vocals. Video images illuminated the sheer retractable screens that hung over the centre-ice stage, and there were enough laser beams to shoot down a fleet of starships.\nThe setlist benefited from Timberlake\u2019s recent dabblings in country music, a practice that reflects the increasing irrelevance of genre-formatted pop music. Alongside some of his most polished dance-floor hits, including SexyBack, Suit & Tie and Can\u2019t Stop The Feeling, were songs from the fatherhood-influenced Man in the Woods, the best of which was Say Something (written with country star Chris Stapleton).\nPerhaps the most effective single moment of the concert was the campfire scene.

Children given technology opportunities at home watch less television, improve problem solving and critical thinking skills and excel in written communication skills, math skills and computer skills according to the Department of Education. Parents have found that new technology in schools increases communication with their children and their children\u2019s teachers. Be sure that as a parent, you stay up to date on the evolution of technology in education so that your kids can reap the benefits.\nThe integration of technology and education has encouraged enthusiasm from students, elevated achievement levels, created richer classroom content and has improved retention rates for students according to the National School Boards Association. Students who use technology in school can enhance their communication and research skills as well as become more analytical in their thought process. If you give children the tools to research their interests, their education could be limitless. Not to mention that having even basic technological skills can exponentially increase their value in the job market.\nSchool districts and administrators across the nation have been focused on advancing their services through technology.\nSchools across the nation have implemented online, progress-monitoring solutions to track students\u2019 scholastic progress and help identify areas of struggle for individual students. The Yearly ProgressPro\u2122 program by McGraw Hill integrates each state\u2019s standards into the tracking system so educators can compare each student\u2019s progress with state accountability exam standards. This program also gives teachers the freedom to build their own assessment for each classroom of students.\nLearning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard and Schoology are tools that connect students, teachers and parents through a social-network platform. Kids can reach out to one another for homework advice or collaborate on special projects while communicating any potential road blocks with teachers. In addition to the networking function, educators can manage their classrooms online through LMS. They can set deadlines, give quizzes and even post homework assignments. Think of LMS as a Facebook for school but with the added security and services that school districts require.\nGet your kids familiar with technology so it\u2019s not as intimidating when they start school.\nGiving children a head start in technology is just as important as starting them off reading and writing at an early age. The more comfortable children are with technology, the less of a shock it will be for them when they are introduced to it in an educational environment.\nChildren need to come to school with a respect for the technological world. Just as parents have rules about crossing the street, they need rules about Internet use. First and foremost is the emphasis to maintain privacy. No matter where they are, children should never post personal information and never divulge passwords to anyone, including friends.\nEven the most well-behaved children check their good judgment at the keyboard. Talk to them about their integrity and reputation by considering long-term consequences. Children are used to hitting delete and their words are gone. They need to understand their digital footprint; the idea that their words may not disappear permanently when delete is pushed, as some social networking sites archive information. Ask them how they would feel if a college admissions staff member or employer were sitting beside them as they typed? Check that their words in emails reflect the way they want to be understood.\nThe responsibility for teaching digital citizenship is not solely on parents.

The test could take up to 48 hours to complete. If the results are ideal, the cap could be used to stop the flow from the well while work resumes on efforts to plug it permanently. More likely, a successful test will enable BP to siphon all the oil from the well to ships on the surface in a controlled manner, eliminating leaks until the permanent fix is made.\"\nWhere Things Could Go Wrong The Associated Press reports: \"If the cap holds, if the sea floor doesn't crack and if the relief wells being prepared are completed successfully, this could be the beginning of the end for the spill. But that's a lot of ifs, and no one was declaring any sort of victory beyond the moment... The worst-case scenario would be if the oil forced down into the bedrock ruptured the seafloor irreparably. Leaks deep in the well bore might also be found, which would mean that oil would continue to flow into the Gulf. And there's always the possibility of another explosion, either from too much pressure or from a previously unknown unstable piece of piping.\"\nTesting of the new cap will take place over 48 hours. In that time, a team of scientists and engineers will use pressure readings and sonar to examine the condition of the well bore, which extends 13,000 feet down from the wellhead \u2013 which itself is 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf \u2013 to the reservoir of oil.\nEngineers worry that if the well bore is damaged, oil could blow out the side of the well bore and form a new gusher elsewhere on the sea floor.\nIf pressure readings remain high, that will indicate that the well bore has retained its integrity \u2013 that oil is staying inside the well bore and pushing up against the cap. Low pressure readings would suggest that oil is escaping through cracks in the well bore, forcing BP to open the cap again and revert to collecting oil in surface ships.\nAt the White House, President Obama called the development a \u201cpositive sign,\u201d though he cautioned that the operation was still in the testing phase.\nOfficials at all levels played down expectations.

Not long ago, a pair of canvassers for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC tied to Paul Ryan that is dedicated to keeping the House of Representatives in Republican hands, visited the homes of everyone here who isn\u2019t a registered Democrat. They just wanted to ask the locals if Rep. Mimi Walters, a second-term Republican, has their support, they explained, and to leave behind a sunny-looking door-hanger that touts her record. It probably seemed innocuous. But the canvassers were a symbol of radical, unpredictable turmoil.

This tends to weaken the protective outer layer of the hair cuticle. But thanks to some home remedies, you can make your hair healthy all over again.\nThe term split ends refers to the splitting or fraying of the hair shaft at the tip of your hair.\nWell! Who would not like to have smooth, shiny and healthy hair? But due to a large variety of chemical products available in the market, our hair tends to get damaged. Some of the common hair problems are dry hair, hair falling or thinning, gray hair or even split ends. The term split ends refers to the splitting or fraying of the hair shaft at the tip of your hair. The condition is medically called trichoptilosis. Split ends can be caused by thermal, mechanical or chemical stress or when the hair becomes damaged. This tends to weaken the protective outer layer of the hair cuticle. Lack of proper nourishment can make the problem of split ends even worse. They can look unappealing and make your hair shabby. But thanks to some home remedies, you can make your hair healthy all over again.\nFrom dry hair to itchy scalp, split ends, dandruff and hair loss, this naturally available shrub can help in getting rid of all your hair problems!\nLack of proper nourishment can make the problem of split ends even worse.\nEggs are rich in protein and essential fatty acids in eggs can help treat split ends. Hair are primarily made up of protein and this is why eggs can help strengthen the hair follicles. In addition, eggs will make your hair smooth, reduce tangles, and make your hair thick. You can use an egg hair mask by mixing some oil or curd.\nNot only for health but coconut oil is rich in healthy fatty acids which makes it an excellent natural conditioner that can nourish your split ends.\nYogurt is again rich in calcium and protein and other healthy nutrients. You can combine yoghurt with egg or oil to make a hair mask. You can use this hair mask on regular basis for lustrous and thick hair.\nThe light and creamy texture of bananas is great for conditioning hair and can help you get rid of split ends. Rich in potassium and antioxidants you can make a hair mask with a mashed banana. You can even mix in some honey, lemon juice or coconut oil for extra moisture. Apply it to your split ends and wash it after it dries.\nThe protein in milk can be beneficial for your hair and will make dry ends silky and soft. Simply dip your hair in warm milk or rinse your entire head. Even almond milk, soya milk or coconut milk will help treat your damaged hair.\nHoney is a sticky substance which can actually benefit your hair. It is powerful enough to attract moisture and retain the moisture. You can thin out honey by combining milk, lemon juice or even oil to it."}

But one after another, women interrupted. Protesters popped up in the back of the room, yelling and waving signs before being hustled out by police. Women Senators spoke out of turn: \u201cMr. Chairman, I\u2019d like to be recognized,\u201d pleaded Democrat Kamala Harris of California, to no avail. Kavanaugh sat quietly in the middle of it all, a cherubic smile on his face.\nBut the women, it turned out, weren\u2019t done disrupting him. Just when the end seemed in sight\u2013his confirmation vote less than a week away after a hearing that had turned up no more than the usual partisan angst\u2013Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor, decided to put her name to a devastating accusation, charging that, some 36 years prior, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her.\nIt was a hazy accusation: hesitantly lodged, short on detail and curiously timed. But Ford\u2019s charge shattered Kavanaugh\u2019s carefully crafted tableau, calling into doubt the image he projected. The row of young girls, legs bare in their private-school skirts, looked different now. In the ensuing scramble, Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote was postponed, and he and Ford were invited to testify before the committee on Sept. 24. The prospect of such an extraordinary public hearing conjured obvious parallels to Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. Twenty-seven years later, another professor with misgivings about coming forward had leveled allegations against a conservative Supreme Court nominee on the eve of his confirmation. And what had seemed a done deal became a fraught and fitting modern morality play.\nBut while the political spectacle may be similar, this battle will unfold in a different era. Every week brings new variations on the theme of women, racked with pain and rage, rising up in protest after too many years of trauma and terrified silence. Every week, too, has brought fresh reminders of the extent to which our whole reality is the product of the privilege and prejudices of entitled men. They decided what the story was, who got ahead, what the laws were and to whom they applied. Who lived and who died, from prisoners on death row to the fetus in the womb. Who was believed and who was destroyed. The men handled the disruptions quickly and quietly, with lawyers and payments and handshakes, with the grip of a policeman\u2019s fist and a gavel pounded on a desk. Until suddenly there were too many to be contained.\nWith just a few weeks to go until the first national election of the Trump era, one in which all signs point to a tsunami of female rage as the decisive factor, a dramatic face-off between Kavanaugh and his accuser may be on the horizon\u2013a showdown between two individuals and their memories of what did or didn\u2019t happen so many years ago. But the stakes go beyond that, to who is believed and who decides the truth at this turbulent moment in America.

When Lost aired, it had the most expensive pilot ever made at the time. So everybody tried to copy that triumph... with mixed results.\nWith a pilot estimated to have cost somewhere between $16 and $20 million (reports differ), a per episode cost of around $4 million, and a major promotional campaign that included trailers at screenings of X-Men: First Class and Harry Potter, this dinosaur-laden disaster cost upwards of $50 million dollars\u2026before marketing costs.\nA flash flood in December almost killed one of the production's security guards while he was trying to save a generator.

What, you ask, was Supertrain about? Well, it was about a supertrain, powered by nuclear energy, that shot between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds of around 200 miles per hour. Presumably stuff happened on board \u2014 the show was supposed to be a sort of Love Boat on a train \u2014 but the main point seems to be the train.\nThe show experienced difficulties right from the start: a model train set costing around a million dollars (over $3 million in today's money) crashed at its very first demonstration. Cancelled after only nine episodes due to low ratings and terrible reviews, Supertrain also regularly appears on \"Worst Television Shows of All Time\" lists.\nBattlestar Galactica was enormously expensive for its time, rumored to have cost around a million dollars an episode (over $3.6 million, adjusted for inflation). And although it eventually got rebooted as one of the most beloved science fiction shows of all time, the show's performance in 1978 was only so-so: after a strong start, it was overwhelmed by CBS's All in the Family, and ABC decided not to renew it for a second season.\nThe pilot for this short-lived reboot cost somewhere around $7.4 million dollars to produce, with per episode costs of about $6 million and a promotional budget of over $15 million.

Airport officials are warning travelers of even longer waits at security this summer. Tim McClung, aviation marketing manager for the Iowa Department of Transportation, was among state officials who toured Iowa\u2019s airports this spring. McClung says state and Transportation Safety Administration officials stopped at all 113 publicly-owned airports in Iowa. It took five weeks. McClung says their goal was to focus not only on the big airports, but on the small strips where air travelers are also the pilot and owner of the plane.McClung says it was an effort to educate the pilots, tenants and workers at the state\u2019s airports. Local city leaders were invited to meetings with the transportation, security and airport people to talk about security concerns and simple local measures. McClung says it\u2019s a matter of common sense approaches, like making sure keys are taken from the plane\u2019s ignition and the aircraft\u2019s properly secured. He calls it a \u201cneighborhood watch\u201d approach. There\u2019s also a nationwide toll-free number, 1-866-G-A SECURE, for anyone to report suspicious activity they may see at an airport. Far from terrorists or hijackers, McClung says the concerns at most local airports revolve around more mundane kinds of problems. He says it\u2019s the everyday type of trespassing they worry about, as the T-S-A itself has concluded that general aviation, private planes and their small airports, don\u2019t pose much of a threat. The trip, however, was part of an effort to tighten security so there\u2019s less likelihood of any terrorist action, daily vandalism, or danger to the public who might wander into trouble at a small airport."}

It wasn't for eight or nine months before I connected.\"\nIt was a feeling that Henry, who lives in Boston, would experience again with the birth of his second child.\n\"[My wife's] family, from the first day, was lavishing hugs and kisses on the new baby,\" he recalled. \"I just wasn't feeling it.\n\"After I had my first child and didn't have these feelings, I was like, 'What's going on? Am I a sociopath?'\"\nFor Henry, as with many new fathers, the feeling of indifference eventually passed. By the time his second child was born, he said, he \"was head over heels with the first kid\" and \"almost felt disloyal to baby number one for connecting with baby number two.\"\nToday, he said, he loves his children deeply and has developed a strong emotional attachment to both.\nWhile few fathers may be willing to admit to having an initial emotional disconnect with regard to their newborn children, psychological experts say such feelings are far from uncommon.\nIndeed, in a new book titled \"Home Game, An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood,\" author Michael Lewis explored the same spectrum of feelings when it came to the birth of his first daughter, Quinn.\n\"A month after Quinn was born, I would have felt only an obligatory sadness if she had been run over by a truck,\" Lewis wrote. \"Six months or so later, I'd have thrown myself in front of the truck to save her from harm.\n\"What happened? What transformed me from a monster into a father? I do not know.\"\nJerrold Shapiro, professor of counseling psychology at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., and author of \"The Measure of a Man: Becoming the Man You Wish Your Father Had Been,\" said that it is not uncommon for fathers to experience a delay in bonding with their children shortly after they are born.\n\"When infants first arrive ... it is very important for the mother to bond with the baby,\" he said. \"But for the first period of life, and perhaps longer, basically the father is an outsider. The primary bond is between the mother and the infant; the father is there to protect that bond.\"\nAnd Leslie Seppinni, a marriage family therapist and clinical psychologist practicing in Beverly Hills, Calif., said it is not just the father who can experience this detached feeling.\n\"It's really normal, and it's normal for the mother as well, which many people don't know,\" she said. \"It's not automatic that you're going to bond with your child. Usually it does take a little while.\n\"This is like a foreign object that comes into your world; you are not prepared for it, and it takes over your time.\"\nSo if it's so common, why don't more people talk about it? Shapiro and Seppinni agreed that the considerable stigma that surrounds the issue often quells discussion among new parents -- even if they are thinking and feeling the same thing.\n\"People don't want to talk about how difficult it is when you first have a baby because you don't want to feel like an unloving person,\" she said. \""}

As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate.\nThe two titans of America\u2019s finance capitalist duopoly clashed \u2013 leaving behind a dull fart. It was as if the town hall at Long Island\u2019s Hofstra University was hermetically sealed against the raging realities of a world and nation in systemic crisis.

Apply additional corporate \u201cincentives\u201d to boost investment (Obama) or a thicker layer of laissez fair (Romney). And, by all means, extract more energy (Obama and Romney) from the exhausted environment, as if lack of fuel is what has stalled the engines of late capitalism. But do not, under any circumstances, question the inherent right of bankers (a.k.a. \u201cmarkets\u201d) to dominate every aspect of economic and political life.\nBanks were mentioned only three times: once, by Romney, in connection with (of course) cutting taxes, and twice by Obama. The president is proud that his grandmother was the vice president of a small bank, and he took credit (deservedly) for denying banks their $60 billion cut of college student loans. But the funneling of $16 trillion in guarantees, grants and virtually \u201cfree\u201d money to financial corporations over the last four years \u2013 a profound restructuring of the relationship between the State and Wall Street \u2013 has been unmentioned in all three debates to date, because it is a policy consensus within the duopoly.\nRomney owned the word \u201cpoverty,\u201d just as did the Republican nominating convention in Tampa, while Obama uttered the term not once. Corporate media pundits and even many \u201cprogressives\u201d accept the Democrat\u2019s avoidance of the subject as understandable, since he is an incumbent. Yet, the fight against poverty was Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s rallying cry during capitalism\u2019s previous great crisis, and Lyndon Johnson initiated a War on Poverty. Today\u2019s poverty rate hovers only a fraction of a percent below the level of 1965, but the standard-bearer of the party most identified with the poor has nothing to say on the matter.

The number of participants could rise to a baker\u2019s dozen should China be welcomed on board by the United States (President Obama has signaled that he would recognize the Chinese communist government\u2019s partnership in the bloc).\nBarack Obama is asking for fast track authority for the Trans Pacific Partnership. Consider that to be another version of \u201cyou have to pass this to see what is in it.\u201d With fast track authority, there will be no hearings on this treaty. It will be negotiated then sent to the Senate for a simple up or down vote. The Senate will not be able to provide advice and consent because they cannot offer amendments under fast track.\nLess than one fifth of the Trans Pacific Partnership deals with trade. The remainder of the treaty governs a myriad of things, including regulating the price of medicines. A few months ago, a mix of conservative and liberal groups stopped the \u201cStop Online Piracy Act\u201d or SOPA. Most of the provisions of SOPA are included in the Trans Pacific Partnership.\nUnder the proposals of the TPP, American sovereignty would be eroded. American courts would be inferior to foreign trade courts and disputes between American citizens and foreign corporations would not be litigated in American courts but in these trade tribunals.\nThe TPP is guilty of each of those charges, and the evidence is overwhelming.\nPerhaps the most disturbing aspect of all the roster of frightening things about the TPP is the secrecy surrounding the details of the agreement.\nA few federal lawmakers have tried in vain to bring into the light the frightening compromises being made by our trade representatives at the TPP negotiations.\nZach Carter of the online Huffington Post reported that Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs and Global Competitiveness, was stonewalled by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) when he attempted to see any of the draft documents related to the governance of the TPP.\nIn response to this rebuff, Wyden proposed a measure in the Senate that would force transparency on the process, and that was enough to convince the USTR to grant the senator a peek at the documents, though his staff was not permitted to peruse them.\nWyden spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer told the Huffington Post that such accommodations were \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d but not ideal in light of the well-known fact that on Capitol Hill the real work of drafting and evaluating legislation is performed by the representatives\u2019 staff members who are often experts in particular areas of domestic and foreign policy.\nIt is instructive that a duly elected senator of the United States has to beg and plead and threaten legislation in order to see the TPP trade agreement negotiations, but corporate interests are given a password by the USTR that grants them full, unrestricted access to those same documents.\nAfter more than a decade of broken promises from NAFTA, CAFTA, and normalized trade relations with China, we can now add a credibility deficit to the trade deficits we\u2019ve seen.

Although predation pressure is known to induce tadpole chemical defences, the new findings are the first unequivocal evidence of toxin synthesis spurred by competition in vertebrate animals.\nBeing poisonous can make a species essentially inedible to predators, but making potent toxins comes at a metabolic cost\u2014so it\u2019s best to make that investment count. \u201cIt would be very profitable for such animals to kill two birds with one stone by using their anti-predatory toxins as chemical weapons against their competitors, too,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Veronika B\u00f3kony, an ecologist with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest.\nCommon toads are equipped with bufadienolides, potent toxins that cause harm by accelerating and disrupting the heart\u2019s rhythms. Field studies have found that common toad toxicity varies geographically, with the intensity of competition being the most reliable predictor. But it has been unclear whether such patterns occur because populations are genetically isolated from one another in different ponds, or whether they reflect defences induced by environmental factors.\nB\u00f3kony and her colleagues took this question to the laboratory, rearing toads in artificial ponds with varying numbers of individuals\u2014a proxy for the strength of competition. The species composition of the ponds also varied; some contained common toads, others contained agile frogs (Rana dalmatina) and some contained a mix. Agile frogs hatch earlier and grow to larger sizes than common toads, so they were considered to represent tougher competition. Because the frogs are non-toxic, the researchers wanted to see whether the toads\u2019 toxins are especially aimed at these intense rivals (a phenomenon called allelopathy).\nThe more competitors the toads were raised with\u2014of either species\u2014the smaller and more toxic they were, echoing the field results. But surprisingly, toad tadpoles defended themselves against their own kind more fiercely, by producing more toxins than they did against the frogs. Meanwhile, the frogs didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by their toxic tankmates.\nGary Bucciarelli, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, also praises the work: \u201cI think the researchers present a very compelling study that questions the evolution and ecological role of amphibian chemical defences.\u201d His own research has shown that newts become more toxic in response to stressful conditions. Such findings \u201creally begin to scrutinize the idea that predation alone drives variation in animal chemical defences\u201d, he adds.\nB\u00f3kony and her colleagues aren\u2019t done with the toads yet, as the unexpected lack of harm to the competitor frogs \u201cbegs the question what exactly [the toads] are defending themselves from\u201d. Cannibalism is certainly a possibility, as tadpoles of many species are known to turn on their own when times are tough.\nBut B\u00f3kony wonders whether the toxins might serve a different function altogether. She hypothesizes"}

Each blob represented a vessel likely to cross the path of Hoverspeed's huge car-carrying catamaran as it headed for Calais.\n\"The English Channel is the busiest waterway in the world, with around 500 ship movements a day, and it seems to get more crowded every year,\" the skipper said as his twin-hulled ship reared up out of the water and picked up speed to 32 knots. \"It's becoming an art to dodge the traffic.\"\nFive years ago, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand signed a treaty to build a \"fixed link\" between England and France, it was widely assumed that after the tunnel opened in 1993 passenger ferries plying the stretch of water the French call la Manche (the sleeve) would be phased out.\nIt was not to be. One of the most striking effects of the \"Chunnel,\" even before it opens, is the vigorous competition between its future operators, Eurotunnel, and shipping companies determined to keep on carrying people, cars, and freight between Britain and continental Europe.\nThe growing fleet of catamarans, each big enough to carry 450 passengers and 80 cars, represents only part of the fight-back approach the ferry operators are adopting.\nGraeme Dunlop, managing director of P&amp;O European Ferries, says his company has already introduced a new generation of super-ferries on the run between Dover and Calais. This summer ships like the \"Pride of Kent\" are carrying up to 2,000 people and 650 vehicles on the 75-minute journey.\nWith the cross-Channel market growing at 5 percent a year, Mr. Dunlop said, the Chunnel is \"a challenge we can live with.\"\nHoverspeed, with its steadily expanding 45-minute SeaCat service, is just as certain that it can find a way to survive and prosper, despite the huge tube buried beneath the seabed.\nThe Chunnel is a mammoth project: Twin rail tunnels and a service tunnel between them each have a length of 31 miles.\nBut critics of the environmental as well as the economic impacts of the tunnel have been proved wrong, Eurotunnel authorities say. Long-term damage to the landscape has been kept to a minimum.\nAt the two Chunnel entry points - Shakespeare Cliff near Folkestone and Sangatte just south of Calais - the 5.5 million cubic yards of chalk and clay removed from the Chunnel were pumped into giant lagoons. As the lagoons filled up, large expanses of artificial land were created. These are now being planted with grass, shrubs and trees.\nAt Folkestone a 345-acre switchyard is nearing completion. There, cars and freight will be loaded onto trains undertaking the 35-minute Chunnel journey.\nOn the French side, at Coquelles where there was more room for spreading out, a 1,729 acre terminal, the size of London's Heathrow Airport, is being built.

Building on the innovations of Marley Marl, Ced Gee, and others, the producers of the early '90s -- among them Pete Rock, Diamond D, Large Professor, and DJ Premier -- built complex sample-based productions and drew from a palette that included increasingly obscure soul jazz, jazz-funk, and R&B cuts -- and did so in an atmosphere of ferocious innovation and competition. At the same time the gangsta genre narrowed hip-hop's militant political street ethic -- epitomized previously by politically conscious stances of Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy, among others -- but the resulting controversy took the genre to a wider market.\nAmong the year's releases were debuts from Organized Konfusion and Freestyle Fellowship; Public Enemy's Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black; KMD's Mr. Hood, UMC's Fruits of Nature, Pete Rock & C. L. Smooth's All Souled Out EP, and follow-ups by Geto Boys, Ice Cube, and much more. What follows is, necessarily, a highly partial selection of the year's highlights. If it leans more towards beats production than the era's increasingly popular gangsta genre, perhaps that is because hip-hop's militancy reinvents itself every few years -- with a canny eye on the genre's commercial opportunities -- whereas the time's layered production innovations remain relevant in a work of digital audio tools such as Pro Tools, Cubase, and Reason.\nForemost among 1991's superlative beatcraft is Main Source's LP Breaking Atoms. Astonishingly out of print for more than ten years until 2008, Breaking Atoms was the product of producer/MC Large Professor and Canadians Sir Scratch and K-Cut. It's hard to pick a standout track from the album, with highlights such as \"Just a Friendly Game of Baseball\"--a tale of police brutality marching across the top of the mainstay Lou Donaldson \"Pot Belly\" sample. \"Peace Is Not the Word to Play\", like \"Snake Eyes\" or \"Just Hangin' Out\", is comprised of samples so densely intertwined that it is only with attentive headphone listening that the songs' distinct components are revealed. \"Live at the Barbeque\" introduced Nas to the world: ostensibly an MC cut, Nas's taut delivery ignites the song from its first verse, signalling the talent that would flow into Illmatic in 1994.\n\"Just to Get a Rep\"\nA wall of textbook DJ Premier productions--tight, perfectly focused, impulsively looped creations--Gang Starr's second album, Step in the Arena, was modestly reviewed upon release.

He had fought leukemia for more than a decade.\n\"He did a lot of good in this world,\" said Peterson's longtime friend and attorney, Robert Ballantyne. \"When he had an idea, he didn't waste a lot of time discussing it. He just went ahead and did it.\"\nA native San Diegan, Peterson was the son of a salesman for a milk and ice cream company. His talents as an organizer and promoter became apparent when he attended San Diego State College.\nPeterson founded the Collegiate Club to hold dances at Balboa Park on Friday nights and was helped by fellow students Art Linkletter, Faye Emerson and Gregory Peck. The profits allowed Peterson to pay his college expenses.\nLater, he was a traveling salesman for a company that sold milkshake mixers. He founded Topsy's drive-in restaurant in San Diego in 1941 and served as a lieutenant in naval intelligence during World War II.\nAfter the war, Topsy's became Oscar's and Peterson pioneered the concept of the \"drive-through,\" where patrons drove away as soon as their food arrived. The idea was to make a fortune for Peterson and revolutionize the fast-food industry and the American way of eating.\nIn 1950 he started his first Jack in the Box restaurant and expanded the drive-through idea to include a speaker hidden inside a brightly colored plastic clown.\nBecause patrons did not linger, the restaurants enjoyed high volume sales and prices could be kept low. He resisted unionization but installed a profit-sharing plan for employees.\nBy 1967, when Peterson sold the chain to Ralston-Purina, there were 300 Jack in the Box restaurants and the drive-through idea had become an industry standard.\nFrom hamburgers, he branched out to banking, hotels, philanthropy and civic improvement.\nAlthough studiously avoiding publicity, he was one of a handful of civic-minded businessmen who transformed San Diego from a Navy town where the power structure was clubby and predominantly Republican and the economy was perilously dependent on military spending.\nHe backed reformist political candidates and greatly expanded activities to market San Diego worldwide as a vacation spot. He founded a fund-raising group that aggressively tapped private and public sources to bolster museums, theaters and individual artists.\nHis penchant for change, and his lack of tact in accomplishing it, earned him the enmity of some in the city's business community. \"The Establishment hates me because they don't like the boat rocked,\" Peterson said in an interview with The Times in 1982.\nA registered Republican, he nonetheless supported Alan Cranston, George S. McGovern, Frank Church and the presidential campaign of Edward M. Kennedy. For his fund-raising efforts on behalf of those and other Democrats, he was named to the \"enemies list\" compiled by the Administration of President Richard Nixon.\nAlthough Peterson was a supporter and contributor for three decades, Cranston said he never asked for a political favor or tried to influence a vote.

Pinos Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest has seen the greatest tree mortality associated with drought and pine bark beetles.\nHow many trees have died in Southern California?\nAn estimated 2 million trees.\nWhy are so many trees dying?\nConsecutive years of drought have stressed pine trees throughout California, making them more susceptible to attack from pine bark beetles. When a pine is healthy, it can successfully fight off attacks from pine bark beetles by \"pitching out\" the beetle from the tree. During a drought, pine trees are too water-stressed to prevent bark beetles from attacking en masse.\nWhat kills more trees, drought or fire?\nDrought stress is predisposing pines to attack from pine bark beetles. In California, we have several native species of pine bark beetles that are killing numerous species of pines. Pine bark beetles kill more trees than wildfire every year, regardless of the drought conditions.\nShould we expect it to continue?\nI expect elevated levels of pine mortality to continue as long as the drought continues, especially in areas with current pine bark beetle activity.\nWhat about the trees that haven't died and their chances for surviving?\nI am more concerned about the forest stands near or adjacent to areas with current pine bark beetle activity. If the drought continues, I expect the pine bark beetles to move into these forest stands.\nWhat does this mean for our state and forests?\nElevated pine mortality in the communities, along wildfire corridors and in high-use sites in the national forests can increase safety hazards for people, reduce aesthetics, impact forest management objectives and require additional funding for tree removals."}

{"idx": "4464", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Brown Deer - Gov. Scott Walker said Monday that his policies had saved Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 billion so far - savings largely achieved by the Republican governor and lawmakers repealing most public workers' union bargaining and effectively lowering their compensation.\nMuch of those savings - more than three-quarters of a billion dollars - could be verified, such as state and local workers picking up more of the tab for their health care and pension. But the figures also included a significant amount of savings for local governments that could not be verified.\n\"It's not just about saving money and balancing the budget,\" Walker said in a news conference at Dean Elementary School. \"It's about new ways to provide services.\"\nWhen Walker took office last year, he faced a projected shortfall of more than $3 billion over the two-year budget starting in July 2011. Walker dealt with that by focusing largely on spending cuts rather than tax increases, with roughly $1.3 billion in cuts over two years for schools, local governments, universities and technical colleges. He and GOP lawmakers also put tight limits on local officials' ability to raise property taxes.\nTo help local officials absorb those cuts, Republicans repealed most collective bargaining for most public employees and required those workers to pay at least 12% of their health benefits premiums and 5.9% of their salary toward their pension benefits. According to the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office, that reduced the take-home pay of the average state worker making $50,000 a year by $4,228, or 8.5%, though the effect was cushioned by the fact that Walker didn't renew the practice of unpaid furlough days for state workers.\n$226.3 million in annual saving from higher pension contributions from state workers and $82.4 million in saving from state workers paying more for their health insurance. That saving is verified, but it also included $40.9 million in programs that are paid for by federal taxpayers, so the state won't necessarily be able to keep that money.\n$464 million in yearly saving from local government workers paying more for their pensions. That saving also is verified but could include other sources besides those coming from state taxpayers, so again the local governments would not necessarily get to keep all of that saving.\n$65 million in saving this fiscal year on health coverage by raising employee payments, similar to co-pays for employees for non-preventive care. That saving is verified.\nAn undetermined amount of saving for requiring workers to have five years of service and at least two-thirds full-time employment to qualify for a state pension.\n$300 million in saving that the Walker administration estimates came from making local employees pay more for their health care. These figures are much more difficult to verify. That's because local governments in some cases were already making employees pay health care premiums at the levels mandated by Walker and GOP lawmakers, reducing the amount of saving.\nRob Henken, president of Public Policy Forum, noted that Walker's legislation gave government officials new opportunities to save a significant but unspecified amount of money through changes to overtime, sick leave and other personnel practices. But impacts to workers also could translate into impacts to services, he said.\n\"Without question, Act 10 has created an opportunity for local government financial managers to pursue personnel savings through a variety of different mechanisms. The key, however, is the extent to which such savings can be pursued without negatively impacting the quality of services,\" Henken said.\nWalker's office said the Brown Deer school district saved $600,000 from"}

When the Iranian revolution unfolded two years later, both sides agreed to cancel the contract. Cubic then sold the equipment to Canada.\nBut the new Iranian government wanted an accounting of the canceled deal, which Cubic refused to provide.\nIran took its case to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 1991, where the Iranian government was awarded $2.8 million.\nCubic, however, ignored Iran's payment demands. So its defense ministry filed a petition with the U.S. District Court in San Diego, which upheld the ICC award owed to Iran.\nSeeking enforcement of that award plus interest, Iran appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There, Cubic argued that the court should not side with Iran because it is a rogue state that sponsors terrorism. Furthermore, claimed Cubic, the Iranian defense ministry had been added to a WMD blacklist in 2007, causing its property in the U.S. to be frozen.\nUnfortunately for Cubic, both the U.S. State Department and Treasury Department filed legal briefs with the court stating that the contractor should indeed pay its outstanding debt to Iran.\nIn deciding the case, a federal judge ruled that Iran not only is entitled to the $2.8 million, but also $316,000 in interest and $131,000 in attorneys' fees."}

Eventually, Orf discovered what he calls the Streamwise Vorticity Current. These winds help sustain these strong superstorms.\nThis was all possible by creating a hyper-accurate recreation of the conditions conducive to forming tornados, like abundant moisture, instability, and wind shear.

One could assume it\u2019s a bit of politicking during election season, an attempt to take the heat off the president and help his re-election bid. One could see it as a diplomatic move, aimed at quelling tensions in the Middle East. One could take it at face value. Or, one could lose her ever-loving mind and accuse Clinton of betraying feminism.\nFeminism is about \u201cstrong\u201d women.\nNo matter how many charities feminists set up, no matter how often we advocate for the most vulnerable among us, the myth persists that feminism is merely about women getting together to celebrate how strong we are, which in turn suggests that someone\u2019s feminist card can get revoked if she doesn\u2019t pass some arbitrary test of strength. In the real world, feminists want women to be equal with men, and are focused on removing actual obstacles that prevent that from happening, which is more about society and less about the personality traits of individual women.\nRubin clearly is invested in the conservative definition of \u201cstrength,\u201d which appears to be a \u201cwillingness to be belligerent even (and especially) when it\u2019s inappropriate or likely to backfire.\u201d Feminists tend to be critical of this definition of strength, seeing it as the result of an uncompassionate definition of masculinity instead of a real sign of personal power.\nFeminism means not being held to the same standards as men.\nDespite the obsession with female strength, Rubin also falls into the same trap as others who misrepresent feminism: believing that it\u2019s about creating special dispensations for women. Why shouldn\u2019t Clinton take responsibility for the Libya situation and take the heat off her boss? That\u2019s what a man in her position would do. It\u2019s part of the job. The notion that feminism never means having to take one for the team like a man is just silly. It\u2019s about equality, remember? That Clinton behaved just like a man in her role is, at best, a feminist victory, but really should be considered unremarkable.\nFeminism is a birthday party thrown for you by your mother.\nFeminism is about making women equal to men, not putting men on a leash and making them do everything you want. Somehow the myth took off during the Clinton impeachment that feminism was supposed to bring an end to male infidelity, and therefore a cheating husband was rightfully the concern of feminists. I see Rubin has not let that nonsense go. As the official arbiter of feminist concerns for the length of this column, I can safely say infidelity isn\u2019t a top one. Feminism was never about giving women everything they want, but making sure that life is conducted on an even playing field. Since women cheat nearly as much as men, consider our work on this topic done.\nWomen\u2019s rights are dependent on women being perfect.\nPeople of color bump up against the expectation that they have to be perfect to be deemed good enough for basic equality like everybody else.

Rubin applied the same framework to Clinton here, suggesting that any mistake\u2014or what Rubin believes to be a mistake, anyway\u2014should mean the termination of one\u2019s right to wear the feminist mantle.

An increasingly difficult political climate both at home and abroad may be part of the reason behind Uribe\u2019s surprising move.\nThe FARC and the government had been in a stalemate since April, with the President repeatedly rejecting the guerrilla group\u2019s condition that Senator Cordoba be present at the site because he would not allow the liberation to become guerrilla propaganda.\nUribe\u2019s reversal is definitely unusual. The president is known for being consistent and confident, even stubborn. Rarely does he turn back so blatantly on a previous position, which has led to plenty of speculation about the reasons for his unexpected change of mind.\nOpposition politicians have alleged that Uribe ceded to FARC conditions in order to create a political \u2018smoke screen\u2019 and protect himself from the growing \u2018notary scandal\u2019. Their claim may have some validity. The \u2018notary scandal\u2019 may be the President\u2019s largest political problem in recent memory. While Uribe has managed to avoid domestic political consequences for many scandals during his presidency, from parapolitics to false positives, none have been linked so directly to the President as the emerging accusations of bribery in the process leading to the 2006 referendum.\nAnother hostage liberation would not only distract the public from this growing scandal, but it would also provide the President with a much-needed boost in political capital and national optimism. One year after operation Jaque, perhaps the high point of Uribe\u2019s Presidency, there have been no similar blows against the FARC. In fact, the guerrilla group has managed to stay in the headlines with a series of significant ambushes.\nFurther, the crime waves affecting many of Colombia\u2019s larger cities have exacerbated the growing sense of insecurity. While most people may not blame Uribe directly for local crime, they do see it as a reason for a change in policy. Whereas last year Colombians were celebrating Uribe\u2019s Democratic Security policy and even looking forward to the end of the country\u2019s decades-long armed conflict, these days there is a growing sense, even among some Uribistas, that the policy needs a change in focus, emphasis and implementation.\nFinally, the sluggish economy, as evidenced by the recent announcement that Colombia is officially in recession, only adds to the sense that the country is on the wrong track. Indeed, Gallup polls show a 15-point drop in the President\u2019s approval rating between July 2008, right after Operation Jaque, and May 2009.\nEqually importantly, international support for President Uribe also seems to be weakening. British MPs dealt a significant symbolic blow to Uribe by ending military aid to Colombia, largely because of the \u2018false positives\u2019 scandal. Colombia\u2019s far more important relationship with the United States has also entered a new, more complex era. Although Uribe\u2019s recent meeting with President Obama was friendly, it is clear that the new American administration will not give Colombia the unconditional support it enjoyed under President Bush.\nIf Uribe\u2019s move is not a \u2018smoke screen\u2019, it is at least an acknowledgment that he no longer has the political capital to single-handedly set the terms of hostage releases.

The project is 5-year translational research project, which consists of a 22-partner consortium, made up of 15 academic and seven private sector institutions. University of Southampton is the project coordinating institution, where Professor Gail Taylor leads the research work and is the WATBIO project coordinator.\nThe goal of WATBIO is to use the power of next generation sequencing to accelerate the breeding of non-food biomass crops for drought-stressed conditions while maintaining biomass productivity and quality in water scarce environments, which are unsuited for food crops. WATBIO focuses on the improvement of poplar, miscanthus and arundo which are perennial non-food crops with high biomass yield. For poplar and miscanthus the research will produce new germplasm with increased drought tolerance. For arundo, its genetic diversity will be assessed and increased, and breeding tools will be developed."}

Nothing exemplifies this more than the struggle content strategist Elka Karl experienced in her attempts to find a sofa to fit her family\u2019s needs. Trying to balance her husband\u2019s desire for a \u201ccomfy place to take a nap\u201d with her son\u2019s proclivity for turning sofas into indoor trampolines could have steered the Berkeley resident down a path of safe albeit predictable choices. However, Karl was determined not to allow her design sensibilities fall by the wayside. Mixing family heirlooms, vintage finds and strategic retail purchases, she was able to create a delightful mix that clearly highlights her feminine perspective in a house where men outnumber her two to one.\nSet in the hills of Berkeley, the adorable cottage greets guests with a sense of warmth and vitality, starting with the Dutch front door where Elka and her son met us for the house tour.\nBuilt in 1930, the house boasts a compact but efficient layout that fits a spacious entry, two bedrooms, a living room, a formal dining room, a bathroom and a large kitchen. Many of the wonderful features of the original construction have been saved, creating the perfect melding of old and new, as witnessed upon entering the home through the wide foyer. Decorated with vintage and thrift-store finds, it provides all the essentials to start and finish your day, even including a place to rest your hat\u2026 if hats are your thing!\nDirectly off the hall are the bedrooms, which are again decorated with vintage treasures from local markets and shops.\nIn her son\u2019s room, Elka wisely decided to install bunk beds, which not only have seen their fair share of sleepovers but double as the perfect bones for fort building. Rather than go the typical color route of bright, cheery and primary for the room, Elka chose a midtone green hue. At once playful and masculine, the color is the perfect backdrop to the wood tones and dark window treatments in the space. It envelops the space and hides a multitude of toddler sins, from errant crayon marks to little shoe prints.\nIn contrast, the master bedroom is light, bright and airy. Elka employed a trick designers often use with her wall paint selection by going \u201chalf-tone\u201d from the ceiling. The subtle variation of color highlights the room\u2019s plaster walls and architectural features without being glaring. Otherwise, she used color sparingly, such as in the green bentwood chair, in the room to create a calm and quiet oasis for rest and relaxation. While neutral, the bedroom deftly showcases how masculine and feminine objects can live in perfect harmony to create balance."}

Who needs La Nina?\nWithout any obvious large-scale patterns influencing the weather, Colorado seems to have returned to a normal winter storm pattern, with wave after wave of Pacific moisture rolling onshore and delivering a steady series of dumps across the Northern Rockies.\n\u201cThe westerlies across the Pacific are strong now and are driving repeated storms into the western mountains. It has not, however, been far enough south to produce snow and rain for the southwest USA, including southwest Colorado,\u201d said state climatologist Dr. Roger Pielke.\nThursday\u2019s storm snarled holiday traffic but also delivered a fresh blast of new snow at all local areas, with 6 inches at Copper Mountain, five at A-Basin, 3 at Breckenridge and 2 inches at Keystone, as of the 2 p.m. Colorado Ski Country USA snow report.\nJust across the Divide, Loveland picked up 9 inches for the highest storm total of the day.\nAlthough Breckenridge weather watcher Rick Bly hasn\u2019t compiled the month-end totals for Breckenridge, December is sure to wind up as the third month in a row with above-average precipitation, the first time that\u2019s happened in quite some time. As of Thursday morning, snowfall for the month was about 40 percent above average, Bly said.\nAnd there\u2019s more snow on the way, with the forecast calling for waves of moisture to roll in every few days, at least through early next week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very progressive, active Pacific Ocean,\u201d said Colorado Avalanche Information Center forecaster Scott Toepfer, indicating that another storm is due Saturday night, with another system ringing in the New Year with fresh powder Monday night into Tuesday.\nToepfer said it looks like the jet stream could drop a little further south with that system, bringing heavier snows to the Northern Mountains along with a good blast for the San Juans, where precipitation has been lagging a little bit. The snowpack at Red Mountain Pass is at about 84 percent of normal, Toepfer said.\nIn general, the southern mountains have been drier than average this season, especially compared with the past few years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the luck of the draw where the storm track decided to stroll this year,\u201d Toepfer said, explaining that the jet stream has just stayed that tad to the north, which means the San Juans haven\u2019t seen those juicy southwest flows coming in from Southern California.\nThe recent series of storms has been originating in the central Pacific rather than the Gulf of Alaska, which means the temperatures have been slightly warmer than average for this time of year. Looking at large-scale satellite images, Toepfer said there\u2019s a zonal flow beginning in China and Russia and extending all the way across the Pacific before ridging and troughing as it hits the West Coast.\n\u201cIn that kind of flow, the storms move in fast and move out fast, and there\u2019s not a lot of time for dry slots to form in between,\u201d he said. The current weather pattern comes close, but doesn\u2019t quite meet the definition of a Pineapple Express, when copious subtropical moisture from near Hawaii hooks up with the Polar jet stream for what can be exceptionally heavy snows.\nBut should the present pattern shift just a little, with storms coming in slightly colder, conditions could resemble the winter of 1983, \u201cwhen we were tunneling down Main Street (in Breckenridge) to get our mail,\u201d Toepfer said.\nThe outlook for the"}

Manufacturers also working on tools to help better manage today's multi-device workplace.\nDevice reliability and attractive pricepoints have been identified by consumers in four Southeast Asian countries as the two most important factors when purchasing a PC or laptop for work. Manufacturers, too, are paying attention to these considerations as well as increasing efforts to introduce systems to better manage all devices entering the enterprise arena.\nAccording to an online survey commissioned by Toshiba and Intel and conducted by ZDNet Asia, respondents in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand identified reliability and price as their top two considerations, while Indonesian consumers pointed to reliability and processor type.\nIn Singapore, 49 percent said reliability was the leading factor when purchasing a PC for their companies, while 45.5 percent in Malaysia and 36.5 percent in Thailand indicated likewise. Price was the No. 2 factor among 19 percent of Singaporeans and Malaysians, while 22 percent of Thais felt the same way.\nAbout 29 percent of Indonesians agreed that reliability was the most important factor and 18.5 percent pointed to processor as the second-leading factor, the survey showed.\nThe poll was conducted in July and November this year, pulling in a total of 525 respondents.\nPC makers that ZDNet Asia spoke to agreed with the survey findings.\nLee Chown How, country general manager of Lenovo Singapore, for one, said enterprise users are most concerned with business continuity so system reliability--which Lee associates with after-sales service and compatibility with current and future applications--is the most important PC purchasing factor.\n\"While price is a key factor in the buying decision, it is not the top reason for business users,\" he said, citing findings from Lenovo's internal study in December 2010 on corporate PC trends and buyer behavior.\nNg Tian Beng, managing director of South Asia and Korea at Dell, explained that reliability is a key factor because, with so many choices in the market today, the differentiator for enterprise laptop is its computing power as well as reliable vendor service which is necessary to deliver \"the best end-user experience\".\nThat said, Ng noted that the economic uncertainty and impending \"double-dip\" recession are placing pressure on companies to opt for systems with lower costs, both in the backend and frontend, putting price as a topmost concern.\n\"Given the pressure on CIOs to watch their pockets, it is not surprising that price is a key factor in the purchasing decision today for enterprise laptops,\" he said.\nGiving a slightly different perspective on the price debate, Paul Donovan, vice president and general manager for product marketing at Hewlett-Packard Asia-Pacific and Japan's personal systems group, noted that while price is a key consideration, purchase decision is also dependent on user profile, affordability and usage model.\nElaborating, Donovan said some consumers shop for a blend of performance, storage and post-sales support. With these in mind, they then hit the stores to seek out the most affordable deal available, he noted.\nPrice, he added, does not always equate to value which can be represented by reliability, engineering and proprietary benefits.\nIn the enterprise space, IT procurement specialists will look at price as a variable out of a basket of decision points such as warranty, delivery timetable, leasing conditions, product lifecycle management and ease of manageability, among others, Donovan explained.\nFor one enterprise user, price is the least"}

{"idx": "4487", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The price-to-earnings ratio is a widely used -- and misused -- investing metric. Do you use it correctly?\nThrough the end of August, go back to school with The Motley Fool. You'll find more educational book reviews, stock analysis, and financial advice here .\nThe share price is the market capitalization divided by the number of shares, so the results should be identical. Share price and the market cap are easy to find in the quote section of any financial website. The earnings are usually taken from the trailing 12 months (TTM) and can be found by checking the income statement for the past four quarters. A P/E using TTM figures is often called the current P/E.\nAnother variation is the forward P/E, which is calculated using analyst future earnings estimates, rather than actual historical earnings. Most financial websites give both the current and forward P/E. I find forward P/E a useful guide for cyclical companies, companies coming out of negative earnings, and those that have significant one-time charges embedded in current earnings. You may also encounter the dilutedP/E, which accounts for a company's diluted shares.\nYou'll often find slightly different P/E values for the same company on different financial sites. Why? Because some sites normalize earnings for one-time items, which distorts the P/E ratio. These small variations are immaterial.\nIn essence, the P/E tells us how much an investor is willing to pay for $1 of a company's earnings. The long-term average P/E is around 15, so on average, investors are willing to pay $15 for every dollar of earnings. Another useful way to look at this: Turn the P/E ratio around to look at the E/P ratio, which when expressed as a percentage gives us the earnings yield. For instance: 1/15 gives us an earnings yield of 6.67%.\nThe \"P\" in the P/E ratio is determined at any given point by the market value of the company or its shares. Built into this market price are the future expectations of the company's growth. If Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a P/E of 54.8, and Motley Fool Inside Value pick MittalSteel (NYSE:MT) has a P/E of 8.2, does this tell us whether Mittal is a better value than Google?\nMaybe, but maybe not. For starters, analyst expectations for Google's earnings growth over the next five years range between 23% and 62%; estimates for Mittal are currently hazy because the company is in the process of merging with competitor Arcelor. Mittal, or the combined Arcelor-Mittal entity, is unlikely to grow at more than 10% over the same time period. So clearly, future growth expectations significantly affect the significance of the P/E ratio.\nAs you'd expect, different industries have different average P/E ratios. Mittal is in the steel industry, which typically has low P/E ratios. Other steel-industry giants like Korea's Posco (NYSE:PKX) and Japan's Nippon Steel generally sport P/Es in the single digits. Steel is a commodity, and the industry is highly cyclical. Clearly, it's important to understand the industry when comparing P/E ratios -- industries with higher perceived risk attract lower P/E ratios.\nInvestment returns also affect the P/E ratio. If I can buy shares in a company with a return on equity (ROE) of 30"}

Consensus estimates placed the expected rate for October at 180,000.\nThe 9.2% drop in the report constituted the largest decline in the housing starts rate since April, 2009.\nThe rates of decline for single-family and urban multiple starts were 8% and 15%, respectively.\nThe Canadian housing market has experienced moments of weakness and is considered to be moderately overvalued, but experts state that it is not in the same condition as the U.S. market was three years ago before the bubble burst. The American market created a housing bubble as prices were artificially escalated beyond what the market could bear \u2013 resulting in a drastic drop in prices that still has not reached bottom in most areas of the country.\nIn contrast, economists Earl Sweet and Sal Guatieri believe that the Canadian market is largely devoid of speculation. They calculate that the market is overpriced by 11%, down from an 18% rate last year.\n\u201cThough overpriced, the absence of widespread speculation and egregiously loose credit standards suggests the market is not in a bubble. Instead, Canada\u2019s housing market remains reasonably affordable because of exceptionally low interest rates,\u201d wrote Sweet and Guatieri.\nAs a result of this global forex trading news, the Canadian dollar fell 0.39% against the dollar, which rose to 1.0042. The loonie did manage to gain 0.54% on the euro, though, although this increase was mostly due to resumed concerns about debt problems in the euro zone periphery.\nCanadian futures are down 0.33%, to 0.9955.\nThe drop in housing starts for October is worrisome to some extent for investors who fear a repeat of the American housing market collapse and subsequent recession. However, today\u2019s global forex trading news is not overly indicative of such a move, and investors should look at the figures with caution, not panic."}

For one thing, no one was sure of the actual size of the plan until Tuesday with Trump suggested the final investment goal would be anywhere from $1 trillion to $1.8 trillion.\nDespite the headline investment number, the infrastructure package will include only $200 billion in direct federal investment. Trump expects the other $1.3 trillion to come from a combination of local, state, and private investment, incentivized by the federal seed money.\n$100 billion (50% of the total federal investment) in grants on \"infrastructure incentives\" designed to encourage investment from state governments, local governments, and private companies on \"core infrastructure.\" Each state could only receive up to 10% of the total, and federal grants couldn't make up more than 20% of the total spent on a project.\n$20 billion (10% of federal investment) on the \"Transformative Projects Program.\" The program would give federal money to swing-for-the-fences type projects that can't get money from private markets due to the \"uniqueness of the program.\" Included in the possible programs that could receive money are \"commercial space\" ventures.\n$50 billion (25% of federal investment) on rural infrastructure. This is to ensure that projects in rural areas, which usually have lower returns on investment, do not get left behind.\n$14 billion (7.05% of federal investment) to grow existing federal credit programs for infrastructure.\n$10 billion (5% of federal investment) towards a \"Federal Capital Financing Fund\" that would assist federal agencies in purchasing land for new projects or indicatives.\nAnother key question is how the Trump administration will come up with the $200 billion. Many Republicans would likely balk at adding more to the federal deficit, so administration officials suggested previously that the investment would be financed through cuts to other programs.\nTrump's 2018 budget proposal included cuts to Amtrak, infrastructure investment grants, and the Army Corps of Engineers' civil works programs.\nTherefore, some opponents suggest that the plan is not new investment at all, but simply shifting around existing funding."}

In March, drivers were late for 22 percent of 160,000 trips, up from 11 percent in December.\nThe agency\u2019s administrator, Kevin B. Quinn Jr., said the situation was temporary, as its vendors look to add 200 more drivers by summertime.\nProblems began last week for Smith. But Wednesday, she said, was by far her worst experience.\nThe Maryland Transit Administration announced Tuesday that it had completed the installation of new bike racks on 35 MARC Train rail cars. The move will allow train riders to bring full-size bicycles on most weekday rush hour Penn Line trains.\nA driver was supposed to pick her up at the usual time of 4:30 p.m. outside the Social Security Administration in Woodlawn, where she works as a program analyst. By 5 p.m., she called dispatchers and was told her driver was on the way. An hour later, no one had come. She called again and was told no driver had been assigned to her trip, so she would have to wait at least another hour.\nIn the end, a driver showed up at 8:45 p.m. and dropped her off at her Perry Hall home at 10 p.m., about 16 hours after she left her house \u2014 and long after her husband had tucked their 5-year-old son into bed for the night.\nQuinn said the concerns are serious and the agency is taking steps to improve the system. The MTA will use two vendors, down from three, to provide drivers to operate its mobility vehicles. The third vendor will switch to running a new operations control center.\nPreviously, the companies \u2014 First Transit of Cincinnati, Transdev Services of Lombard, Ill., and MV Transportation of Fairfield, Calif. \u2014 each provided their own dispatch services. MV Transportation will take over that role. That move, Quinn said, is intended to create efficiencies and better service. The MTA also is adding a quality assurance team.\nNone of the companies responded to requests for comment.\nThe state Board of Public Works approved the new contract March 20. The contract could grow to $745 million, if the board extends it beyond 2022 through 2026.\nWhen Maryland transit officials decided to close down Baltimore\u2019s Metro Subway line for nearly four weeks for emergency repairs last winter, they relied on track inspection guidelines that didn\u2019t comply with industry standards.\nThe MTA has given First Transit and Transdev 100 days to hire and train 100 more drivers each, Quinn said. The agency did not provide the number of drivers who were lost in the transition.\nMobilityLink\u2019s performance has slid from 89 percent on-time trips in December to 78 percent in March. A driver is considered on time when he or she arrives within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival.\n\u201cWe are working with our providers to tackle this and ramp them up as quickly as possible as we go through this transition phase,\u201d Quinn said.\nThe MTA does not prior"}

The investigation centers on the 2011 Hyundai Sonata and 2012 and 2013 Kia Forte -- an estimated 425,000 cars.\nSome of the vehicles are subject to recall. In late February, Hyundai filed a defect information report (DIR) that resulted in a NHTSA recall. The company said it produced the DIR after post-collision inspections of the vehicles' airbag control units (ACUs).\nHyundai said the inspections showed what it called an \"electrical overstress condition\" of one of the components in the airbag system was present in three of the crashed vehicles. A fourth ACU is still being analyzed.\nAt the moment, regulators say Hyundai has not found a way to repair the problem. It is still investigating the cause of the failure with the part manufacturer.\nMeanwhile, NHTSA said it is aware of an earlier recall where an electrical overstress condition appeared to cause airbag failure in certain Fiat Chrysler vehicles. It will try to determine whether the problem is present in vehicles from other manufacturers.\nNHTSA says its Office of Defect Investigations will evaluate the scope of Hyundai's recall and confirm whether Kia uses the same or similar part. The investigation will also review the root cause of the issue, with an emphasis on finding what is contributing to the part's electrical overstress.\nAs an enhanced safety feature, airbags were introduced in passenger vehicles in the U.S. during the mid-1970s as an option in luxury cars. Passenger cars and light trucks built after September 1, 1998 were required to have airbags for the driver and the right front passenger.\nCredited with saving countless lives since then, the airbag has not been without its problems. Airbags made by Japanese manufacturer Takata have been the cause of the largest auto recall in the U.S., after it was determined that its airbag inflators could explode, spraying tiny bits of metal throughout the vehicle cabin.\nThe defect is blamed for 13 fatalities in the U.S. Takata recently agreed to a $650 million settlement with 44 states and the District of Columbia while its automotive customers have paid out a total of more than $1 billion in settlements."}

Unable to afford treatment in her local town she has found herself over the years shunned by her local community as her disease has steadily progressed and led to extreme disfigurement in her appearances.\nThe situation first came to light in 2001, when Li Hongfang noticed swelling on her forehead. At the time she thought nothing of it as it wasn\u2019t painful, but over the course of four years the situation worsened leading her to finally seek medical assistance.\nWhat is worth noting is at at the time of initial discovery the woman was told she should make the trek to a city hospital to tend to the grievance but thought better of it as she didn\u2019t have the cost of travel in hand.

The article was basically about the top 10 things that are hot right now but are, essentially, \u201cback to the future\u201d developments in technology that had a history of being tried before and failing. The list included a host of technology-based products and services including: group buying sites (e.g., Mercata), tablet computing (e.g., Microsoft Tablet PC), B2B exchanges (e.g., Alibaba) and internet-based personal service sites (e.g., Webvan), all of which had a day in the sun that ended much like a visit by Frosty the Snowman to Acapulco\u2014badly and with little hope of return, or so people thought (and often hoped) at the time.\nSimilar to the technology reincarnations discussed in the Xconomy article, the reasons for failure of these healthcare concepts were varied. Timing was part of it in some cases, technology limitations the cause in others. Sometimes the reason for failure was cost and often times it was misaligned financial incentives. In any event, here is my own back-to-the-future list of old healthcare ideas that seem to be coming back, this time in much fancier clothing.\n1. Payment Reform is what it\u2019s called now. It used to be called capitation and/or provider incentive payments. The idea of \u201creforming\u201d the way that the healthcare system reimburses providers by making them financially accountable for their outcomes and incentivizing them to produce good quality care has been around a long time. There was a lot of talk about this, particularly in the 1980s and 90s, culminating in a significant number of provider financial disasters when they found themselves without the tools to manage care effectively to ensure that a fixed budget payment system worked. California is one of the few locales where provider sub-capitation lived on through to this day, refusing to die like the guy in those old Halloween movies. Everywhere else? Pretty much dead. But rising from the grave here it is again as we see a healthcare reform law that supports provider financial responsibility for outcomes (e.g., responsibility for hospital readmissions for 30 days post discharge) as well as its counterpart, pay-for-performance. Those words are the same as they were in the 1990\u2019s, but now we\u2019re trying to figure out how to make them meaningful through regulation (adopt an electronic health records system and use it meaningfully or suffer the financial penalty). It will be interesting to see how this experiment works out the second time.\nI agree with most of what you have written. We are thinking of purchasing software that will enable us to perform EHR for our clients. My question is, could we benefit from the proposed EHR subsidies retroactively?\nExcellent article; your point about accountable care organizations and medical homes is exactly right.

My birthday is Nov. 3. This year on that date, I turned 67, an age where a guy can feel things he didn\u2019t feel at 47 or 27. Sore things, mostly. Aching things.\nBut there are other reasons for my annual aging epiphany, Rosie and the pheasants included. Together they can really make me feel my age, usually while we\u2019re somewhere deep in a cattail slough or a tangle of switchgrass and clover and sunflowers.\nWe are usually moving at a pretty good clip at such times. That\u2019s the only way Rosie knows how to move, especially when she\u2019s working the scent trail of a crafty rooster pheasant that is itself on the run.\nHunting behind a field-bred springer spaniel is an exercise in hustle. Because when the spooky pheasants decide to run rather than sit \u2014 and most choose to run, especially wild pheasants on often-hunted public land where Rosie and I do most of our hunting \u2014 they inspire Rosie to run, too.\nThe shock collar helps there. Not that I hit the shock button much. I don\u2019t. But I \u201cbeep\u201d her a lot, pushing the button on the hand-held remote so that the receiver on her collar emits a little warning.\nLike most hunting dogs, Rosie understands that sound. It means she has to wait up for the aging human struggling through the thick stuff behind her. She also knows that if she ignores the \u201cbeep\u201d several times, the collar will sting.\nI prefer not to use the shock option. And as you can imagine, Rosie prefers that, too. And she\u2019s no fool. So the beeps are almost always enough to keep her from getting too far ahead and flushing the birds out of range.\nI had two springers before Rosie and managed to hunt without a shock collar. I used a ultra-high-pitched training whistle, which worked well enough most of the time.\nMy other springers were good dogs, better in some ways than Rosie, not quite as good in others. She is stronger than either in body and will. Especially will. So midway through her second hunting season, Rosie started wearing the collar in the field.\nIt made hunting with Rosie more fun. I didn\u2019t realize just how much more until I showed up at a pheasant hunt I organize each year with a landowner near Holabird. When I broke out the shock collar, other hunters erupted in applause.\nSeveral of them cheered. One pretended to be weeping with joy. At least, I think he was pretending.\nSince then, the collar became essential. So I was concerned on Nov. 3 \u2014 my birthday pheasant hunt \u2014 when I rummaged through my SUV at a state game production area near Hot Springs and realized I\u2019d forgotten the collar.\nRosie seemed to realize it, too, and got a little giddy.\nI dug around in my hunting bag and found the dusty old Acme high-pitched dog-training whistle I used before the shock collar. Rosie recognized the sound affectionately, seeming to remember that it was all warning and no sting.\nOver the next few hours of hunting, I pe"}

The fishermen were very good at monitoring the management measures,\" said Serge Doucet, regional director of Fisheries and Oceans Canada for the Gulf of St. Lawrence, speaking in French.\nDoucet noted that no North Atlantic right whales died in Canadian waters this year from entanglements or collisions with fishing boats.\nAnd although there have been some interactions with whales this year, the department believes that measures to protect right whales have been effective so far.\n\"There were challenges, it was not easy for all fishermen,\" he said. \"But their commitment to protect whales is there.\"\nMartin Mallet, executive director of the Maritime Fishermen's Union, was also at the meeting in Moncton, where he was told the department is willing to listen to fishermen's suggestions.\n\"It's a good step forward to restore confidence,\" Mallet told Radio-Canada.\nAn Atlantic-wide meeting is planned for later this month to help decide this winter what measures will be renewed or added in time for spring fisheries.\nSince January 2017, there have been at least 18 North Atlantic right whale deaths in U.S. and Canadian waters \u2014 12 off the Canadian coast.\nNecropsies found many of the whales had become entangled in fishing gear or were struck by ships, resulting in strict closures of fishing areas and speed limitation on vessels.\nNorth Atlantic right whales are an endangered species. There are only an estimated 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world. Of those, only about 100 are breeding females and no calves were born this year.\nThis year, two North Atlantic right whales have been found dead \u2014 both in U.S. waters.\nAs a result, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) evaluation of \"recovery challenges\" was released ahead of a meeting this week to address proposals to protect the whales that would alter the lobster fishery in New England.\nThose proposals include reducing the number of sea floor-to-surface lines by 50 per cent over five years and a month-long lobster fishing closure in the western Gulf of Maine."}

This was a beloved teacher \u2014 his favorite really. He had been looking forward to his biannual message here at the Baptist church. Usually they stirred the congregation to renew their faith and the church \u2014 the lawmaker included \u2014 would find their souls warmed just in hearing his voice, as lost sheep might a shepherd\u2019s call.\nBut this message struck a bit too close to the bone, and the lawmaker wondered whether this sermon was meant as a direct criticism of his most recent accomplishment, a work that he had authored and pushed for. And he knew everyone in that huge sanctuary was wondering the same thing, wondering whether all that congratulating they had offered him on his success was now being called into question.\nFinally, the lawmaker could not stand it any longer and interrupted the sermon, hoping to get the preacher back on more comfortable ground, more faithful ground really than this bleeding-heart mess about empty fields and lost workers.\nThe senator answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\nThe preacher smiled broadly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you asked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to tell you a story to answer your question and see if that makes things a bit clearer.\n\u201cYou see, there was once an important lawmaker and he was going down to Montgomery from Gardendale to argue for an important bill he had sponsored because a vote on it was imminent.

He too has been away for a while, but he undertook a far different journey. He has just returned from prison after serving a 10-month sentence for a history of assault. I wrote about Kaz last December when I visited him at Connecticut's Manson Correctional Facility and wondered if he would discover redemption or perdition behind prison walls.\n\"The school seems strange,\" Kaz said.\n\"What do you mean by strange?\" I asked.\nKaz smiles whenever I ask him to elaborate on a thought or comment. \"You know...strange like it's different here.\"\nOne of the tender mercies every good teacher learns is how not to play psychotherapist and answer every question with another question.

I had spent the past 12 months holding a suitcase and carrying a title that should come with a disclaimer. The National Teacher of the Year is a moniker that cannot belong to any single educator because our nation is filled with so many gifted but unsung teachers. Educators who quickly made me feel like an amateur as I watched them teach. But the title is a treasured key that unlocked doors not opened to most teachers.

I learned that the Race to the Top will be an arduous task for many states because they entered the race late and way behind the starting line. I learned that our young people should not be judged too harshly because they are trying to build a better future. I learned that pundits and talking heads are too often detached from what is happening inside classrooms. And I learned that politicians need not worry that the American system of public education is falling behind the rest of the world.\nIt will take months, possibly years, for me to fully digest and appreciate all that I have learned during my travels as National Teacher of the Year. But despite all the differences of opinions and myriad solutions proposed to improve education, I did learn that every parent, teacher, politician, policy maker, academic, and bureaucrat share a common goal to do what is best for our children.

{"idx": "4523", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Can a computer simulation help guide the United States toward producing more and better-qualified math and science students?\nA team of engineers from the Raytheon Co. thinks so. Today, after three years of work, they join business and education supporters in unveiling a \u201csimulation and modeling\u201d computer tool designed to crunch vast amounts of data about students, teachers, and the workforce, and evaluate various mathematics and science education policies.\nCalled the \u201cU.S. STEM Education Model,\u201d the tool relies on complex algorithms and allows users to gauge the impact of policies while adjusting for more than 200 individual variables in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or \u201cSTEM\u201d education.\nThose variables include class size, teacher turnover, gender differences, and teacher salaries, as well as data from scholarly studies that have been put into the system. The tool is free and available for downloading online, though it requires simulation software.\nThe simulation-and-modeling tool, while complex, is meant to provide scholars, state and federal policymakers, and others with a way to study the effects of past, current, and future policies, said Brian H. Wells, Raytheon\u2019s chief systems engineer, who helped develop the system. Initially, it was meant to focus on how to increase the number of STEM college graduates, though it has clear applications for K-12 and the workforce, too, he noted.\nFor example, a recent test-run of the model examined a popular policy suggestion: that raising teacher salaries will draw more top-notch teacher-candidates to classrooms, as opposed to having them take potentially more lucrative jobs in the private sector. The model found that when businesses began losing well-qualified workers, they adjusted by raising salaries in an attempt to lure them back, which \u201ccounteracted\u201d the initial policy, Mr. Wells said. He cautioned that many factors in the model could be adjusted to produce a different result.\nRaytheon, a major defense contractor headquartered in Waltham, Mass., began developing the model three years ago under the direction of the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, William H. Swanson. The company assigned a team of engineers to work on it.\nIt released the model to the public at an event here today, at which time Raytheon also officially turned the tool over to the Business-Higher Education Forum, an education advocacy organization based in the nation\u2019s capital that represents business ceos and university and foundation leaders.\nAs policymakers across the country debate STEM education policy, the modeling tool attempts to nudge the discussion away from anecdotes toward data, said Brian Fitzgerald, the executive director of the Business-Higher Education Forum.\nThe modeling tool already includes data sets that allow for comparisons of the cost effectiveness and the overall impact of diverse policies aimed at encouraging more students to enter and stick with STEM studies and fields, Mr. Fitzgerald said. Those efforts include mentoring and social-networking programs.\nMr. Fitzgerald believes the tool will reveal that many policies for increasing the number of highly qualified K-12 and college students in STEM, and finding a place for them in the job market, are interconnected.\nClarification: The simulation model is officially known as the \u201cU.S. STEM Education Model.\u201d The original version of this story made reference to the STEM Research and Modeling Network, which is a network of business and education advocates working on the development and promoting the use of the model."}

While this would be a net gain for state government, Webb said economic research is fairly clear that a lottery would bring a decrease in retail sales, which would reduce employment, income and gross domestic product over time.\nThe House Lottery Working Group asked people from about a dozen groups or agencies to speak at its final meeting. Web, along with representatives of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, the Department of Revenue, the state casino and convenience store associations and the state council on problem gambling spoke Thursday. The state Baptist Convention, Methodist Council, Catholic Diocese of Jackson, American Family Association, Humanities Council and Mississippi Economic Council all declined the invite or did not respond.\nMississippi has debated having a lottery since statehood in 1817, but for most of its history has prohibited them by law or constitution. In 1992, as legal casino gambling began to flourish in the state, 53 percent of voters in a referendum removed an 1890 constitutional prohibition against lotteries. The Legislature has debated the issue since, but never changed state law to create a lottery, as governors, religious leaders and even casinos opposed it.\nBut recently support has appeared to grow, as the state struggles to fund government services. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant and Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood have both advocated a state lottery, as have numerous lawmakers. Twenty-five years of legal casino gambling in Mississippi appears to have tamped down active opposition to a lottery.\nHouse Speaker Philip Gunn opposes a lottery, but called for the creation of the study committee to gather facts and report to the Legislature. House Gaming Chairman Richard Bennett, R-Long Beach, head of the study group, says he expects a report will be delivered before the start of the Legislative session in January.\nBut Bennett repeated Thursday, \"We are presenting a report on the facts, not making a recommendation one way or another on a lottery.\"\nBryan Ferrell, with the Stennis Institute, warned the panel Thursday that a lottery, while voluntary, is a \"regressive\" tax that impacts those who can least afford it and \"increases income equality.

(AP) \u2014 William Newsom III, a former California judge, environmental advocate and the father of governor-elect Gavin Newsom, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 84.\n\u201cJustice Newsom was a proud, lifelong Californian, a public servant of profound accomplishment and a powerful voice for individual rights and environmental protection,\u201d Nathan Click, a spokesman for Gavin Newsom, said in a statement announcing the death.\nIt comes less than a month before Gavin Newsom will be sworn in as California\u2019s 40th governor.\n\u201cHe may not have gotten to see Gavin sworn in. But he saw Gavin elected governor of this state, which was a great source of pride for Billy,\u201d said John Burton, a close friend of William Newsom\u2019s and former member of Congress from California.\nGov. Jerry Brown appointed Newsom to the Placer County Superior Court in 1975, during Brown\u2019s first term as governor, and later put Newsom on the state Court of Appeals in 1978. He retired in 1995.\nHe was a staunch advocate for environmental protection, serving on the board of the Sierra Club Foundation, the group\u2019s charitable arm, and of the Environmental Defense Fund. Occasionally Newsom was restricted in how much environmental advocacy he could do while serving as a judge, former Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope said. He and Newsom were close friends, with Newsom serving as the best man in Pope\u2019s wedding.\nIn addition to Gavin, Newsom is survived by a daughter, Hilary. He and their mother, Tessa Menzies, divorced when Gavin Newsom, 51, was young.\nWilliam Newsom made a home in the community of Dutch Flat in the Sierra Nevada foothills and fell in love with the landscape and nature there, Pope said. It inspired him to help form the Mountain Lion Foundation and lead a 1990 ballot measure to ban mountain lion hunting.\n\u201cThat was his country,\u201d Pope said.\nDuring his gubernatorial run, Gavin Newsom said his favorite memories with his father were spent camping and backpacking along California\u2019s rivers. His father once had a river otter as a pet, he said. His father also helped shape his views on drug policy and racial justice.\n\u201cHe had an amazing life. He was an amazing influence on me,\u201d Newsom said.\nOn the court of appeals, Newsom ruled on a diverse array of cases from the right of privacy for HIV-positive health care patients to the liability of the San Francisco 49ers over a player\u2019s crippling knee injury. In one prominent case, he ruled the prestigious Bohemian Club, a men\u2019s club north of San Francisco that counted Ronald Reagan as a member, could not enforce a ban on hiring women.\nNewsom was a close friend of Gordon Getty, the son of oil magnate J. Paul Getty, and managed his personal finances. During Gavin Newsom\u2019s gubernatorial run, critics painted him as a son of wealth and privilege because of his connections to the Getty family. Gordon Getty helped finance Newsom\u2019s first wine shop in 1992, which later grew into a successful business line.\nWilliam Newsom\u2019s friends said he was thoughtful, witty and well read.\nPope, his longtime friend, recalled that Newsom even looked for ways to stave off boredom during his frequent drives from the foothills to San Francisco for court sessions.

Very low running costs. Above-par overall output quality, led by very good text quality.\nModest paper capacity. Lacks Ethernet connectivity. Can't print from USB thumb drives or memory cards. Non-duplex ADF.\nThe Brother MFC-J775DW ($149.99) color inkjet all-in-one printer is a good choice for light-duty use in a micro or home office. It avails itself of Brother's high-yield INKvestment cartridges to provide substantial savings in ink costs. The MFC-J775DW is even more economical due to its low purchase price, the lowest of any INKvestment printer to date. Its feature set, however, is on the sparse side; you can get a more feature-rich machine with equally low ink costs by paying a bit more up front with the Editors' Choice Brother MFC-J985DW.\nThe MFC-J775DW is currently a Staples exclusive. It will become widely available starting in February 2018.\nThe matte-black MFC-J775DW is reasonably compact, as befitting a home-office all-in-one. It measures 6.8 by 16.5 by 13.4 inches (HWD) and weighs 18.3 pounds, so it should be easy enough to find room for it on your desk if need be. Paper capacity is 100 sheets, on the low side for a home-office printer. It has an auto-duplexer for printing on both sides of a sheet of paper.\nYou can copy, scan, and fax, as well as perform setup and administrative tasks, from the MFC-J775DW's front panel, which includes a 1.8-inch non-touch display and four-way controller plus related function buttons and an alphanumeric keypad. Although it was easy enough to control the MFC-J775DW's all-in-one functions through the panel, note that the Brother MFC-J985DW comes with a larger (2.8-inch) screen with touch capabilities.\nIn addition to a letter-size flatbed for scanning, the MFC-J775DW has a 20-sheet automatic document feeder (ADF) that can hold up to legal-size paper, but is limited to simplex (one-sided) scanning.\nConnectivity is typical of a low-price all-in-one. You can connect to a PC via a USB cable, or to a local-area network via Wi-Fi, though the MFC-J775DW lacks Ethernet connectivity. It can connect via a direct peer-to-peer connection to a compatible mobile device via Wi-Fi Direct. I tested it over USB connection with its drivers installed on a PC that runs Windows 10 Professional.\nThe MFC-J775DW works with the Brother iPrint&Scan app, and supports Google Cloud Print as well as Cortado Workplace. It is both AirPrint- and Mopria-compliant to facilitate printing from iOS and Android devices.

Click here to register.\nConnecticut is uniquely positioned to implement an adult recreational cannabis program quickly and efficiently.\nConnecticut can develop thoughtful, straightforward, business-friendly legislation for this industry by building on its medical program and looking to Massachusetts, which has pioneered the way for this industry on the East Coast.\nAfter similarly building on its medical marijuana program, Massachusetts opened the first recreational cannabis establishments east of the Mississippi River on Nov. 20. Since its first day of sales through Dec. 30, the cannabis industry in the Bay State grossed almost $15 million, and Massachusetts has projected that the state's revenue will increase by about $215 million in the first two years of retail sales.\nEven though Connecticut has yet to legalize recreational cannabis use, it's important for cities and towns to begin planning for this industry right away.\nHowever, many Connecticut municipalities won't do so until the state gives a clear indication that legalization is imminent. Through a transparent and deliberate legislative process, Connecticut could seize on this opportunity and clearly identify when an adult-use program would begin, giving municipalities, businesses and residents time to plan how and where they want cannabis establishments in their community.\nIt's no secret that growth has been a major issue for Connecticut's economy. In comparison to other parts of the country, Connecticut still has higher vacancy rates among various types of commercial real estate.\nRaising revenue is a major problem in Connecticut. It was a major talking point for both political candidates during the gubernatorial race. Connecticut now has a golden opportunity to capitalize on the ever-expanding cannabis market, particularly when it comes to filling vacant commercial real estate.\nDuring a recent interview on WFSB's \"Face the State,\" Gov. Ned Lamont indicated he would like to see a push for legalized recreational marijuana this year. This is great news for an economy that desperately needs growth. Focusing in on real estate in particular, legalization would assist in filling many vacancies among various types of properties throughout the state.\nThe industrial/flex market alone, with much of the state's inventory being outdated, underbuilt and underutilized, could see a large increase in sales and leasing activity from cannabis legalization.\nGrowing, warehousing and distribution facilities along with research and development labs are just a few examples of the micro-cannabis economies that will improve the industrial real estate market in Connecticut.\nOther states, such as Colorado, have seen industrial vacancy rates plummet due to the advent and growth of the cannabis industry, effectively raising rents for landlords and, of course, increasing revenues for governments.\nKeep in mind, job creation and the housing/residential benefits as well, which is an entirely different topic.\nAnother asset class that stands to greatly benefit is retail. Obviously, like beer and spirits in package stores, cannabis products must be sold somewhere. The disruption e-commerce has caused in brick-and-mortar retail has left many storefronts vacant. Many strip centers have high vacancies with rock-bottom lease rates due to laws of supply and demand. Cannabis can increase the demand for retail space, effectively increasing rents while providing better returns for landlords and investors.\nLuke Massirio is a commercial real estate broker with O,R&L Commercial.

Find it wherever books are sold 4/17/2018.\nSome of my favorite books in the history of Star Wars have been the triple shots of adventures starring Lando Calrissian and Han Solo, published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With Solo getting written by Brian Daley and Calrissian written by L. Neil Smith, the books were short, fun, and had an adventurous vibe that maybe some of the other more serious books in the canon lacked.\nIt's been a while since we've had a book like that.\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older gives it to us in spades. This novel is split into three different timelines for our heroes. The timeline that dates the furthest back belongs to Lando and his droid L3-37 and evokes all of the same spirit as the original Lando books. L3 even feels very much like Vuffi Raa at times, Lando's droid companion in those. She's a droid concerned with things other droids typically aren't and might even be something else entirely. The middle chapter involves Han Solo after he took possession of the Falcon. He's with Chewie, naturally, getting in over his head with Sana Starros and a bizarre job that involves kidnapping a tiny crime boss and stealing a...thing. The present, set after the events of Chuck Wendig's Aftermath trilogy and the Battle of Jakku, brings Han and Lando back together as they sort through a villainous plot that involved both of them, however obliquely, in those previous timelines.\nThat villain is Fyzen Gor, a Pau'an butcher of a surgeon with a plan so mustache twirling that he seems immediately cut from the same cloth as Lando's Legendary arch-nemesis, Rokur Gepta.\nAs Han, Lando, and Chewie work to unravel Gor's plot, they take on a motley crew of help, including a Twi'lek that Lando is involved with, a surly ugnaught, a kid of a pilot who plays their music too loud, and an Ewok who happens to be one of the best tech-slicers in the galaxy.\nThey proceed to fumble and bluff their way through everything until the climax that reminded me in many ways of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but not in a bad way. Lando definitely gets to be the Spock character, jetpacking across space into a hairy situation where an artificial intelligence has gone against its programming.\nI'll admit, this book isn't going to be for anyone who insists that they have to take their Star Wars too seriously. It's fun. There were honestly moments in the book I was laughing out loud, which is rare for me as a reader. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its small touching moments as well. In fact, it cut right into me to see Ben Solo as he is portrayed in this book. Hearing \"Uncle Lando\" call him \"Little Starfighter\" damn near brought a tear to my eye.\nAnother thing I loved about the book was that it was heavy in the prequel references.

In this movie he is forced to reconcile the ideal world that he envisioned as a kid with the realities of growing up as an adult leader. In what ways has that affected him in this newest installment?\nJay Baruchel: It\u2019s everything that he's dealing with, you know, it's a different side of the existential crisis that he was kind of going through in the beginning. In the first film he is sort of born into the margins and at odds with the culture that he grows up in. And there's like a sort of that form of a existential crisis where he's trying to see where he fits in, does he have anything to contribute and who is he supposed to be and how much of his dad should he be. In this one it's the other side of it because it's like he's got everything he's fought for and fought to preserve, this paradise where we can all coexist might not be good for us or for them. And well, that's heavy cause that's been like his great defining ambition and philosophies that we should all just be able to live together. And now that's tested and he has to ask himself if that's actually the case. And to me that coupled with him now in charge and struggling with all of that because it's very easy to be the sort of opposition. It's easy to complain about things when you're the one that actually has to create and run stuff. That's a whole other kettle of fish.

Matt Blunt's administration is requiring the office of Democratic Attorney General Jay Nixon to get its approval before spending additional money from a settlement with a prescription drug benefits company.\nBlunt's administration commissioner, Larry Schepker, said Thursday that it appears Nixon's office deliberately deposited a settlement check from Caremark in the wrong state account and has been spending money from it.\nNixon's office claimed that Schepker's move was political and that Blunt's administration already has processed the expenses it is now questioning.\nNixon is running for governor, though Blunt is not seeking re-election this year.\nCaremark agreed in February to pay more than $38 million to settle claims from 28 states, including Missouri, that it was deceptive when it encouraged patients to switch prescription drugs under the guise of saving money.\nEarlier this month, Schepker began reviewing the handling of $629,987 received by Missouri from the Caremark settlement in response to a request from Republican House Budget Committee Chairman Allen Icet, R-Wildwood. Icet claimed Nixon's office received and distributed the money without appropriation authority.\nSchepker said his investigation determined the settlement check was deposited in the Attorney General Trust Fund although it had been made payable to the Merchandising Practices Revolving Fund. Schepker said he was suspending an agreement with the attorney general's office that has allowed it to self-verify that its expenditures from its trust fund are in compliance with state law. Future payments from the fund will require specific approval from the Office of Administration, he said.\nThat fund now has $215,056, the attorney general's office said.\nThe settlement required a portion of the money to be used to benefit low-income, disabled and elderly prescription drug users, to promote lower drug costs or to educate consumers about cost differences among medications.

{"idx": "4562", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A group of lawyers are pioneering a new kind of divorce, where the partners move past their anger and work together. Muriel Walls explains how it works.\nSHEILA HAS JUST found out that her husband, Stephen, is having an affair and that he wants a separation, or divorce. She is hurt, angry and fearful. Her family and friends tell her she must get the \u2018best lawyer in town\u2019 to fight for her. Stephen feels guilty that his marriage has come to end but it has not been good for years. He is worried about the children and afraid that Sheila will stop him seeing them and will try to destroy him financially. His family and friends tell him to go to the \u2018best lawyer in town\u2019 to protect his position.\nLawyers are part and parcel of the process of separation and divorce but not every case has to be fought out in the courts. If Sheila and Stephen litigate out of fear and anger, the process can be very stressful and uncertain, take a very long time, a lot of money and leave them both dissatisfied with the outcome and possibly unable to talk to one another about their children.\nThankfully many couples are looking for a more civilised and humane way of resolving their dispute and many lawyers can offer that through collaborative practice. Collaborative practice is a process in which both parties, and their lawyers commit to resolving matters between them without involving the court to make decisions on their behalf. It is the \u2018no court commitment\u2019 which offers the prospect of delivering a solution for the long-term benefit of the couple and their family.\nThe key factor in collaborative practice is that both parties and their collaborative lawyers commit in a written participation agreement to resolving issues without going to court. This is a powerful dynamic when everyone focuses on solutions. All the discussions take place in four-way face-to-face meetings between the two parties and their two collaboratively trained lawyers so there are no nasty letters or court documents.\nThe lawyers help each party to say what they need and secure their interests. It is therefore different to family mediation where the lawyers are usually outside the process. The discussions focus on the \u2018concerns\u2019 of both sides and the \u2018interests\u2019 of each of them and any children.\nIn the adversarial process, arguments are marshalled to persuade the court to a certain point of view. It is often a case of winner takes all with little regard for the other side.\nIn collaborative practise the key decisions are made by the parties themselves. They are not made by a judge in a courtroom.\nLawyers are often accused of dragging cases out longer than necessary and not really being interested in settling a case early. The way in which collaborative divorce removes that risk as the two collaborative lawyers sign an agreement with both parties which disqualifies them from representing either side in contested court proceedings if agreement is not reached through the collaborative process. That means they are absolutely committed to helping find the best solutions by agreement, rather than through conflict.\nWhat else happens when a couple embarks on the process? Well, both parties must commit to providing financial and other information and disclosure in an open and honest way. The collaborative lawyers will provide legal advice and guidance throughout the process and they work in a non-confrontational way with both sides and each other to assist in reaching a resolution. Before a four-way meeting they will usually discuss any difficult issues their clients have so both lawyers are prepared for any \u2018hot button\u2019 issues that might arise.\nThe process is flexible and allows both collaborative lawyers consider whether to involve other professionals such as trained counsellors to help the parties emotionally and to improve communication. This is very useful if emotions are running high. Financial and pension experts can explain the"}

And then there are the brave, free-spending few who ask the ride-sharing service to carry them across states.\nA few days ago, the New York Post published the tale of Janis Rogers. This 64-year-old Uber driver picked up a rider in Williamsburg, VA, who wanted to go to her boyfriend's place in the Brooklyn, NY neighborhood of Bed-Stuy. That's a trip of nearly 400 miles and eight hours that amounted to a fare of $294.\nThe Post said Rogers' misadventure \"is believed to be the longest Uber ride on record.\" But after the paper proclaimed this, other Uber drivers began to come forward with tales of even longer impromptu road trips. That's according to The Outline, which today described a new contender for the throne.\nAccording to that post, the title truly belongs to Uber driver Kevin Jones of Omaha, NE. Jones told Outline that in October, a woman had him drive 550 miles from Omaha to Denver, a trip that took less than seven and a half hours (you can drive fast across Nebraska) but tallied a fare of $877, including nearly $300 of extra cost because of surge pricing.\nUntil Uber itself releases official data about the longest trips, we may never know for certain who's the winner; maybe there's a Colorado-to-California trip out there that could top Jones's.

It is a critically important piece of the Sudanese economy, accounting for half of Khartoum's revenue and nearly 98 per cent of the southern government's revenue.\nHow much oil does Sudan produce?\nRoughly 490,000 barrels per day. Production grew sharply for several years - output has more than doubled since 2003, when Sudan produced roughly 210,000 barrels per day - but now seems to have hit a plateau.\nIs all of Sudan's oil in the south?\nNo, but most of it is.\nSouthern Sudan accounts for between 75 and 80 per cent of Sudan's daily output. Its most productive oil fields are in the Paloich and Malut areas of Upper Nile state.\nAnother 5 per cent comes from the Abyei region, often described as \u201coil-rich.\u201d That shorthand is not entirely accurate, at least not anymore: While Abyei accounted for 25 per cent of Sudan's output in 2004, production has declined markedly since then.\nMost of the productive oil fields remaining in northern Sudan are in South Kordofan state, another disputed territory which is supposed to hold \u201cpopular consultations\u201d on its status later this year.\nSo why the dispute over oil revenues, if the south controls most of the oil?\nSouthern officials have said publicly that they'd like to keep 100 per cent of the profits from oil production after their country becomes independent.\nProblem is, they can't. All of Sudan's oil refineries are located in the north. What's more, Southern Sudan will be landlocked, and its only pipeline to the sea runs to Port Sudan in the north.\nThe south's oil reserves are useless without the north's cooperation, in other words - and Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has already threatened to shut down the pipeline if Southern Sudan claims an unfair share of revenues.\nWhen the two sides do negotiate a new royalty deal, Southern Sudan will almost certainly claim a larger share. The two sides currently split southern revenues equally under the terms of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement.\nThere is talk of building another pipeline to the sea through Kenya, allowing Juba to bypass Khartoum, but that would be a long and expensive project. For now, at least, Southern Sudan will depend on the north to export its oil.\nWhere does Sudan sell its oil?\nMost of it - nearly two-thirds - goes to China, Sudan's largest trading partner.\nThe state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation controls 40 per cent of the largest oil consortiums in Sudan. It has invested heavily in Sudan's oil infrastructure, including the pipeline to Port Sudan and several refineries in the north.\nThe industry wasn't always dominated by China: Chevron was the first oil company to invest in Sudan, and the French firm Total has a large concession in the south. But decades of civil war, and pressure from human rights groups, scared off many Western firms. The Canadian firm Talisman was forced to sell its 25 per cent stake in one of Sudan's oil consortiums in 2002 because of a divestment campaign."}

Most important thing it did was convey a sense of the fundamental continuity of American policy. This speech along with remarks by Mr. Dulles later, revealed a greater desire for a flexible and adaptable diplomacy than that shown in the latter-day speeches of Truman and Acheson. There were several assurances that the single aim of our military policy is to prevent further aggression and thus keep the balance of world power favorable to the non-Communist nations. As matters stand now the policy laid down by the President is at the moment the policy of the executive branch alone, although the pres. may succeed in winning Congressional approval. The Senate is uneasy about his failure to say anything specific about political terms for a settlement in the Far East. A Korean peace that contributed to the stability of Communist China, as any Korean peace seems likely to do would be intolerable to a large number of congressmen."}

So goes the claim in a documentary film scheduled to be broadcast by the Discovery Channel March 4th, at 9:00 PM, EST.\nNaturally, a press conference held today in New York City has drawn a lot of huff-and-puff. Most scholars appear skeptical, and a good many preachers are adamant that the documentarians must be mistaken and wicked, wicked, wicked, WICKED because, after all, the implications of the discovery contradict the Inerrant Bible and, therefore, can\u2019t possibly be true and they would have known that right off the bat if they weren\u2019t satanic troublemakers.\nOh \u2026 ho-hum. It does seem to be the case that the filmmakers rest their case principally upon a statistical argument about the likelihood of those names appearing together in a tomb, and if that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got then a lot of skepticism is probably in order.\nThe names Joseph, Jesus, Mary, and Judah are said to be among the most common of jewish names at that time. Okay, but \u2026 how common? What percentage of the population were known by those names, and how big was the population, anyway? You would have to have that information before commencing a statistical analysis. I doubt very much that anybody actually knows, and think it likely that the analysts simply made some assumptions \u2014 maybe good assumptions, maybe bad assumptions, but no better in any case than educated guesses.\nThe problem is that statistical analysis, like environmental modeling, are often sensitive to small variations in the input. Garbage in, garbage out, and all that.\nMy name, for example, is Bob. My wife\u2019s name is Dawn. How many married couples named Bob and Dawn are there within 100-miles, say, of Wake Forest, North Carolina? I haven\u2019t a clue. I do know that Bob is quite a common name, but that Dawn is less so, though hardly odd. How many married couples named Bob and Dawn, within 100-miles of Wake Forest, have a son named John? Once again, I don\u2019t know, though the number surely goes down with the added condition.\nObviously, the likelihood of encountering a family comprised of a husband named Bob, a wife named Dawn, and a son named John varies according to the number of families in the study area. If I increase the study area to a circle having a 200-mile radius centered on Wake Forest, the odds go up; if I cut the study area to a 50-mile radius, the odds go down.\nJust as obviously, you need some population distribution, too. If nobody else lives within 500-miles of here, it really doesn\u2019t matter whether you use a circle with a 50- or 100- or 200-mile radius; the answer will be \u2026 zero.\nIs such information available about the Jerusalem of Jesus\u2019 day, and the few decades afterward when everybody else was dying off? I don\u2019t know, but I doubt it. We\u2019ll all know more after watching the documentary, but I\u2019m guessing this is destined to end up in the \u201ccuriosities\u201d file.\n6 users commented in \" Jesus\u2019 tomb discovered? \"\nCameron Macintosh and the Discovery Channel are just desperate for attention and ratings. This so called \u201cJesus Tomb\u201d was discovered 25 years ago and dismissed. I mean Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were extremely common names back in those times.

{"idx": "4577", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Gracias to Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Mark Tice, a commissioner of neighboring Chambers County, for providing a valuable learning experience about many things, not the least of which is what it means to be an American.\nHidalgo is a naturalized U.S. citizen. She speaks English and Spanish as if they are her first languages. Her language skills were on display March 25 as she gave a public safety update about the Deer Park chemical fire in both languages, with an American Sign Language interpreter translating to ASL.\nTice objected to Hidalgo's Spanish-speaking, posting on social media: \"English this is not Mexico,\" and calling her \"a joke.\" Those comments resulted in a backlash that boomeranged across the nation.\nWhat can be learned from this?\nOne positive takeaway is that delivering her emergency message in both languages was much better than if Hidalgo had spoken only English. About a third of Harris County residents speak primarily Spanish at home. It doesn't mean they don't speak English. But it strongly suggests that hearing the instructions in Spanish was valuable to them during that crisis.\nTice was narrow-mindedly correct that this isn't Mexico. Texas hasn't been Mexico since 1836. But Spanish has been spoken in Texas longer than English. And several native American languages have been spoken longer.\nNo language has a claim on Texas \u2014 or the United States, for that matter. Contrary to a mistaken but prevalent assumption, English is not the country's official language. That's something it has in common with Spanish.\nWe thank Tice for the opportunity to remind ourselves as a state, a nation and a well-meaning neighbor to Mexico that Mexico is only one of 20 countries where Spanish is the primary language. Hidalgo's country of origin, Colombia, is another.\nHidalgo, contrary to what Tice said, is no joke. She is, if anything, an example to this nation of immigrants of the American dream. She's a Stanford University graduate, the first woman and first Hispanic elected to her position in Harris County, and only 28 years old.\nTice is an example of what could be better about America. He jumped to conclusions based on biases shared by many Americans \u2014 biases that make America less great. More than one news account of Tice's comments cited a 2018 Pew Research Center survey in which 22 percent of Latinos reported being criticized in the previous year for speaking Spanish in public. Twenty percent reported being told to go back to their home country \u2014 never mind that the U.S.-born are already there.\nOne final lesson we owe to Tice is that people can learn from their mistakes and make themselves better. Tice took an important step in that direction by apologizing \"to Judge Hidalgo, the citizens of my county, and most importantly the entire Hispanic community for hastily acting out with transgression on social media.\"\n\"I can only hope, in time, that my actions can be forgiven.\"\nIf we can do that, America will be the greater for it and we will have left it a better place for our children."}

Something is very enticing about moving water, such as a waterfall, and birds and butterflies will enjoy it as much as you will. A waterfall is not overly difficult to construct and can be scaled to suit any pond size. Once you complete your waterfall, landscape around it for an enhanced effect, or add some solar lights so that you can enjoy it after the sun goes down.\nPlace a pond pump, which has a water tube, into the plastic pond. Put the end of the water tube that is not attached to the pump either in a bucket or on well-draining area. Turn on the pump, and pump the water out of the plastic pond.\nDecide on which side of your pond you want your waterfall. Place a mound of soil that is about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide on that side of the pond. Pack the mound of soil firmly with the back of a shovel. The mound's size decreases as you pack the soil. Add soil until the packed mound measures 2 feet wide and 2 feet tall.The mound will be the waterfall's base.\nForm the mound of soil into the waterfall's shape by using a hand shovel. Dig to create three tiers in the soil on the side of the mound that faces the pond. The tiers should look like stairs going up the mound. They will be the levels of the waterfall.\nDig to create a shallow dip that is about 10 inches wide at the top of the soil mound. Make the dip lowest on the side facing the pond. The dip will serve as a weir, collecting water at the waterfall's top. Line the weir with a 14-by-14-inch piece of pond liner. Place stones, each about 4 to 6 inches wide and long, on the pond liner's edges. Fill the bottom of the weir with pea gravel. The pea gravel disguises the liner.\nDig a shallow trench from the weir downward on the back of the soil mound and to the side of the pond. Run the pond's existing water delivery tube through the trench and to the weir. Fill the remainder of the trench with soil to cover the water delivery tube and to hold that tube in place. The will move water from the pond to the top of the waterfall.\nPlace a layer of flat stones, each at least 8 inches wide and long, on the bottom tier of the soil mound. Make the stones overlap the pond's edge so the waterfall's water will flow into the pond. Dump 1 cup of water onto the stones to check whether or not the water flows into the pond, and adjust the stones as needed. Put a layer of stones on each other tier, and ensure each layer will allow the waterfall's water to flow into the pond.\nFill the weir with water until it overflows. When it overflows, its water should flow down the tiers and into the pond. Adjust the stones' arrangement if necessary.\nFill gaps between the waterfall tiers' stones with black pond foam. The foam is a water sealant. Toss pea gravel between the gaps right after you apply the foam. The pea gravel will stick to the foam and disguise it.

Strickland was at 4 percent, Marin at 3 percent and Casey at 2 percent.\nMatchups with Boxer also showed Jones running stronger than the other candidates.\n\"Bill Jones ... has the background and the temperament and the experience that will carry him through the primary and the general election,\" said Sean Walsh, a political strategist for Schwarzenegger and a Jones adviser.\nBut Kevin Spillane, Marin's communications consultant, noted the same poll that showed Jones leading also showed 67 percent of Republicans undecided about a candidate to face Boxer.\n\"That shows the race is wide-open,\" Spillane said.\nMarin's campaign wasted no time trying to influence those undecided voters, issuing a news release questioning Jones' loyalty to the party and to the Republican anti-tax credo.\nSpillane said Jones originally had endorsed George W. Bush in 2000, then switched to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Jones also voted for tax increases in the Assembly during previous budget crises.\n\"Polling shows defection from Bush and support of taxes are devastating to Bill,\" Spillane said.\nBut Walsh said the same issues could be seen as examples of Jones' pragmatism.\n\"Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign demonstrated the public has an appetite for elected officials who are willing to roll up their sleeves and in a bipartisan and nonpartisan way do the public's bidding,\" Walsh said."}

They've come close, particularly Brian Orser earning silver in 1984 and 1988. Now, the pressure is on Chan to produce on home ice, and he won't run away from it.\n\"I know I'm going to be as excited as ever and that you have to block out distractions, of which there will be more than ever,\" says Chan, who turned 19 Thursday. \"There will always be some distractions and if you're not able to cope with it, you are probably not ready for the Olympic Games.\nChan, who finished second at last March's world championships, prefers to look at the positive side.\n\"You can't blow this being the home games out of proportion,\" he says. \"So you kind of downplay it and be comfortable with your situation at the Olympics. I think I've had enough understanding of what the expectations will be at the Olympics. Each athlete copes with it differently.\"\nOne way Chan has coped is by training in Florida and Delaware with Don Laws, who coached Scott Hamilton to four world titles and the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics gold medal. Chan believes he doesn't \"get much of the craziness. I can focus on my training and what I have to do\" away from Canada.\nDuring an Olympic season, training becomes more intense and stressful, particularly if a skater is struggling with a certain element or is not completely comfortable with his programs or the choreography. There's also a greater need for patience because the Olympics dominate the competitive horizon.\n\"It's a lengthy process that has to be taken step by step,\" Laws says. \"You can't rush it, and that's something many skaters must learn.\"\nPatience is especially difficult for a teen who has so much so soon. Chan has won two straight Canadian titles, with nationals coming up in two weeks. He went from second at junior worlds to ninth at seniors to second in three seasons. Chan also won Four Continents last year. With a calf injury shortening this season, he struggled to sixth place at Skate Canada in November, falling three times in his free skate.\nChan recognizes how much more progress he must make to push current world champ Evan Lysacek, returning Olympic gold medalist Evgeni Plushenko, former world winners Brian Joubert and Stephane Lambiel, and the top Japanese skaters.\n\"You know the Olympics are all about faster, higher, stronger, and that's exactly true,\" Chan says, smiling broadly, as if memories of Hamilton, Brian Boitano, Ilia Kulik, Alexei Yagudin and Plushenko brilliantly skating off with the gold are flooding his mind. \"All of the other athletes, whether it's skaters or any of the athletes, will be at their best, at their peaks.

As of mid-Monday, signatures will be available for at least half a dozen network scanning programs, including the open-source Nmap, McAfee's Foundstone Enterprise and Nessus, made by Tenable Network Security.\nUp to now there were only two ways to detect Conficker, and neither was easy. One was to monitor outbound connections for each computer on a network, an effort that had already proved difficult for organizations with machines that count into the hundreds of thousands or millions. With the advent of the Conficker C variant, traffic monitoring became a fruitless endeavour because the malware has been programmed to remain dormant until April 1.\nThe only other method for identifying Conficker-infected computers was to individually scan each one, another measure that placed onerous requirements on admins.\nThe discovery of Conficker's tell-tale heart two days before activation may prove to be an ace up the sleeve of the the white hat security world.\n\"This is an extraordinarily inexpensive, not-very-time-intensive way of finding machines on your network that are actually running malicious software,\" said Dan Kaminsky, one of the three researchers who discovered the Conficker fingerprint. \"This is not something we get to do all the time. Most pieces of malicious software are not that easy to find.\"\nThe availability of the new Conficker definitions is the result of the sleuthing and quick response of an industry-wide cast of characters, said Kaminsky, who is director of penetration testing at security company IOActive.\nThe finding came Friday afternoon as Kaminsky pored over data that members of the Honeynet Project had collected on the worm. Along with Honeynet's Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder, Kaminsky soon noticed that Conficker changes the way a small piece of the Windows operating system acts. The behavior, located in pre-authentication routines before users enter file-sharing passwords, makes easy-to-identify changes to the way machines look on a network.\n\"Once I heard that Conficker had code running on the anonymous surface, I said 'Wait, we can fingerprint that,'\" Kaminsky said. \"If you can get packets to a box, you can find out fairly reliably whether it's infected with Conficker.\"\nKaminsky said he then turned to help from Securosis researcher Rich Mogull, who on Saturday began mobilizing providers of network scanning products to add the Conficker definitions as soon as possible.\n\"This is the fastest turn-around I've ever seen,\" Kaminsky said.\nProducts from Qualys and ncircle are also expected to add anti-Conficker detection signatures. Werner and Leder have developed their own proof-of-concept scanner, which is available here.\nSince showing up a few days after Microsoft released an emergency patch for Windows in late October, Conficker has elicited a grudging admiration from security professionals, who can't help acknowledging the worm's sophistication. It attacked multiple vectors, was able to crack passwords and spread like wildfire, infecting more than ten million boxes in just a few months' time, by some estimates.\nConficker's profile has only grown larger in the past few weeks"}

There are pergolas and cupolas, gazebos, even a Thai sailing vessel plus hidden trails, trellised walks and five houses set into the trees (all planted by Tony) and painted his particular shade of turquoise.\nThat fanciful setting is where Tony gave a birthday luncheon for his wife, Elizabeth, the artist who is called Beegle by all her chums, a Gemini like her husband. There have been earlier Gemini celebrations and there are bound to be many more for the Duquettes and their Gemini pals. But this one had its own special charm.\nThe pre-luncheon refreshments--Beegle's pate, margaritas, taquitos, crudites, Tony's favorite Red Eric Danish beer (the late Doris Stein introduced him to the beverage)--were served in a walkway covered by vines and flowers.\nLunch--a Mexican melange of chiles rellenos, enchiladas, rice and beans--was served on a nearby terrace. And by then the sun had emerged from the clouds.\nMany of the guests arrived bearing gifts. Author Mary Anita Loos, who drove up with Jay Allen and Oscar-winning (for \"Spartacus\") costume designer Bill Thomas, brought a straw hat decorated with dried flowers for Beegle and nut corn for Tony. (The guests devoured it after they'd eaten the chocolate birthday cake.) Cynthia Lindsay brought a framed photo she'd taken in Switzerland of a pink-nosed cow decorated with spring posies. Hutton and Ruth Wilkinson were there helping host the afternoon affair while their Highland terrier, Jipper, a red bandanna around his neck, behaved like a perfect gentleman.\nAfter lunch, Tony took people on tours up and down the hilly terrain and into the guest houses. Admiring the decor (the faux wood and marble walls) and Tony's store of treasures were actor Robert Patton, back from San Francisco where he did some Ralph Lauren commercials; banker Harry and Marjorie (Lord) Volk; Katy and Freeman Gates; Tony's brother Lucien Duquette; theatrical producer David Knapp (his mother, Gladys Knapp, is another Gemini); Anne Chamberlain; Anne Mudd, who is now in the fashion business with her daughter, and Alden and Sheila Pearce.\nWhen Cuisine a Roulettes, the organization that last year served 186,000 meals to needy homebound and forgotten seniors in the Central Los Angeles area, stages a fund-raising event, it's done with plenty of pizazz.

He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and he co-founded Trusteer, which was sold to IBM for $1 billion in 2013. Soon after the latter acquisition, he founded Transmit Security.\nInterestingly, Boodaei did so without seeking venture capital. He indicated that by putting his own money (and that of co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) into the start-up, it felt more like when he founded his first firms, but in this case, there was no one else to answer to.\nTransmit Security provides, \"a cross-channel identity platform that is designed to simplify, accelerate, and reduce the cost of identity-related projects,\" as Boodaei explains. He also notes that \"security and customer experience are the two most important goals of any organization today. We bundle these together and address them as a single challenge.\" In this interview, he explains his personal journey as a CEO, the importance of a strong co-founder, and his opinions on the evolving threat landscape.\nPeter High: You are the Chief Executive Officer of Transmit Security. Can you provide an overview of the company?\nMickey Boodaei: We founded [the company] four and a half years ago with the goal of building a cross-channel identity platform that is designed to simplify, accelerate, and reduce the cost of identity-related projects. These include projects such as authentication, authorization, fraud prevention, account opening, among others. Our R&D Center is in Tel Aviv, Israel, and the rest of our technical teams are physically close to our customers in the US and Europe.\nAs a company, we focus on large enterprises with millions of end-user customers. Most of our customers to date have been banks, insurance companies, telcos, and retailers. We have two global financial customers with over 20 million users each, and about 20 customers with more than five million users each. Our customers typically use our platform to consolidate and accelerate multiple initiatives in the identity space. For example; multi-factor authentication in biometrics, behavioral analytics, and advanced fraud detection, attributes-based access control, new data protection regulations, using the mobile device as an authenticator for call centers, branch and web, authorization and authentication around open API's, and more.\nThe platform significantly shortens time-to-market for our customers. It allows you to manage more technologies more easily and significantly reduce integration and maintenance costs of identity-related projects. It is an extremely advanced orchestration technology that abstracts the entire identity ecosystem from your applications, and therefore, significantly simplifies one of the most complex IT problems there is. The more complex your environment is and the more complex your applications are, the more value you would see from our platform.\nHigh: Yours is an organization that is experiencing extraordinary growth, and you have been able to do so without venture funding. Could you talk about the way in which you have grown, as well as the advantages of having done so without taking on venture funding in your early stages?\nBoodaei: Our goal was to build a big company that is focused on what we enjoy doing around cybersecurity, which is working with large enterprises. We wanted absolutely zero external pressure as to the direction of the company or the speed in which we are growing. Therefore, my co-founder Rakesh Loonkar and I decided to invest our own money in the company.\nWe have been relatively successful in the past, so we could afford the risk of losing many millions if we failed.

As well as Jaws, Shaw starred in a host of films such as The Sting, The Dam Busters, From Russia With Love, A Man For All Seasons and The Deep.\nHe also enjoyed television success in the 1950s as Dan Tempest in the long running ITV adventure series The Buccaneers.\nShaw, who was married three times, died in 1978 aged 51.\nHis first marriage to Jennifer Marguerite ended in divorce in 1963 after an affair with actress Mary Ure.\nHe later married Mary but it ended in tragedy when she died accidentally from a mixture of drink and drugs in 1975.

The county extended its voting hours to compensate.\nIn Ohio, 40 polling stations in Cuyahoga County reported problems with their machines.

In 2004, 676,000 provisional ballots were never counted because of mistakes and discrepancies.\nThe biggest political problem behind the use of electronic machines is that they are made by private companies who retain proprietary control over their software, and who have affiliations of their own.

They are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are widely consumed in numerous ways like salads, smoothies (flaxseed powder) or even raw or roasted. Flaxseeds have become popular as a healthy weight loss snack as well. But did you know that these unassuming shiny seeds can also help you in getting smooth, healthy and gorgeous hair?\nFlaxseeds are rich in a number of nutrients that may help in keeping the hair healthy and the scalp hydrated. What's more? Flaxseed hair mask is easy to make and gives you results comparable to a hair spa treatment in salons, given that you generally take care of your hair and a follow diet and beauty regimen that is healthy for your hair type. This is why flaxseeds are found in a number of hair creams that you can buy from stores as well.\n1. Rich In Vitamin E: Flaxseeds are rich in vitamin E, which is great for both skin and hair health. The nutrient promotes the health of the scalp by reducing free radical damage. It helps improve circulation in the head, thus promoting hair growth and slowing down hair breakage. It may also help prevent premature greying of hair.\n2. Rich In Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Flax seeds are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to be great for the skin and hair, as they keep them nourished and prevents hair drying, especially during winters. Some studies have shown that omega 3 may help prevent hair loss and thinning of hair, as well as dry scalp and even dandruff.\n3. Reduces Brittleness: The nutrients in flaxseeds may prevent hair breakage by improving elasticity of the hair strands. Both consumption and topical application of flaxseeds may help improve the quality of your hair substantially.\n4. Nourishment For Hair And Scalp: Flaxseeds act on both hair and scalp, due to the presence of nourishing nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, manganese, selenium and copper. These nutrients boost hair growth and help them grow stronger and longer.\nFlaxseeds can be used to promote hair growth and improve the overall quality of hair and scalp in a number of ways. You can also buy flaxseed oil and apply it on your scalp and hair for a natural hair spa treatment. You can also work with flaxseeds by making a gel out of them. All you need to make this all-natural gel for hair growth is some flaxseeds, filtered water and optionally, a little aloe vera gel or some essential oils like argan oil or jojoba oil. To begin, put the water in a pot and add the flaxseeds to it. Let the mixture come to a boil while stirring continuously.\nYou will see the mixture thickening and a light white froth will begin to form in it. Allow the mixture to cool completely and filter it out using a cheesecloth or a muslin cloth. To the filtered gel, add some aloe vera gel"}

{"idx": "4617", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Cowboys NFL draft winners and losers: Who benefits the most from not drafting Derwin James?\nEditor's note: This story was originally published April 30.\nThe immediate days following the NFL Draft are usually filled with critics determining which teams won and lost the precious three days.\nSince we've already compared how the Cowboys drafted to the other three teams in the NFC East, it's now time to look within Dallas' own roster.\nWhich Cowboys won and lost based off what the franchise did Thursday through Saturday?\nLet's start with the winners.\n1. Xavier Woods: Most thought the Cowboys would come out of the weekend with at least one new safety. Moving Byron Jones back to corner opened the door for Dallas not only to draft a safety, but draft one early. Derwin James could've been a possibility if they were willing to trade up a few spots in the first round. There were some intriguing options in the second and third rounds, too. Since they elected to improve in other areas, Woods comes out looking like the biggest winner. Last year's sixth round pick is currently the team's starting free safety.\n2. Allen Hurns: Had Dallas drafted a wide receiver like D.J. Moore or Calvin Ridley in the first round, that player would have been viewed as the team's Dez Bryant replacement and No. 1 receiver. There's no questioning it now, that role belongs to Hurns. While Michael Gallup could eventually become Dallas' No. 1, wide receivers generally take some time to get acclimated to the pro game. At 26, Hurns is in the prime of his career. He's looking at a great opportunity to have his second 1,000-yard season.\n3. Blake Jarwin: Since news of Jason Witten's expected retirement began to surface, there hasn't been a tight end on Dallas' roster that executive vice president Stephen Jones has talked about more than Jarwin. While fans are more familiar with Rico Gathers, Jarwin is the only one of the two to appear in a regular season game. The Cowboys signed the undrafted rookie out of Oklahoma State off their practice squad in late October. Although they used a fourth round pick on Dalton Schultz, Jarwin could be the tight end who benefits most from Witten moving to the broadcast booth.\nNow for the losers. These are the three players looking at increased competition because of what the Cowboys have done recently.\n1. Charles Tapper: The Cowboys used a fourth round pick on the pass rusher two years ago. However, injuries have prevented him from making much impact on Sundays. Tapper has only played in two NFL games. Dallas used its first of two fourth round picks on a pass rusher Saturday, selecting Dorance Armstrong out of Kansas. Tapper will not only have to compete with Armstrong, but also recently added veteran Kony Ealy.\n2. Marcus Martin: It's unlikely that the Cowboys told Martin he would be their starting left guard when they signed the veteran last month. He was being given an opportunity to compete for the starting job. Well, the competition got a lot tougher when Connor Williams fell to the Cowboys in the second round. He's now the odds on favorite to start between Tyron Smith and Travis Frederick.\n3. Terrance Williams: He has the experience of being with the team for the last five seasons and starting 66 games. But a new position coach, two new free agents and two new draft picks at the position have certainly shaken things up. Instead of just having to beat out Brice Butler for a"}
{"idx": "4618", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Ten years ago, in a week 17 must-win game, the Minnesota Vikings fell victim to a frantic comeback by the 3-12 Arizona Cardinals. In the final two minutes, the Cardinals scored on a 4th down touchdown pass from Josh McCown to Steve Bush, recovered an onside kick, and pulled off a miracle walk-off touchdown on 4th and 25 to the wide receiver featured in a recent NFL Films Presents segment below. It was a catch often forgotten in the list of memorable touchdown catches. Perhaps it is because it was the Arizona Cardinals; maybe it\u2019s because the hero was a guy who caught just one other touchdown pass in his career. But if you like to play the WHAT IF game, it\u2019s a play that changed the last decade in the NFL.\n\u2013 A week later, the Packers were eliminated in Philadelphia. They had made the playoffs when Arizona converted a 4th and 25, and were knocked out after the Eagles pulled off a just-as-unlikely 4th and 26 pass from Donovan McNabb to Freddie Mitchell on their way to a game-tying field goal.\n\u2013 The Cardinals would have had the first overall pick had they lost to Minnesota. The catch dropped them to 3rd in the draft. As a result, San Diego picked first, selected Eli Manning, and traded him to New York, paving the way for the Giants to win two Super Bowls. If Arizona picks first, do they draft Eli and keep him? Is Eli more inclined to play in Arizona than he was San Diego?\n\u2013 The Chargers would have picked second. Do they still take Philip Rivers, the guy they received in the trade for Eli? Or do they take Larry Fitzgerald, and pair him with Drew Brees? And Super Bowl victories follow in San Diego? And New Orleans is still without a title?\n\u2013 Do all the quarterbacks taken that year end up in different places? No Eli \u2013 and no Super Bowls in New York? No Ben Roethlisberger \u2013 and no Super Bowls \u2013 in Pittsburgh? The entire landscape of the league is different.\n\u2013 The Cardinals took Larry Fitzgerald third overall, which ultimately led to the demise of the hero wide receiver. He was bumped further down the depth chart, and a year later, ended up signing with New Orleans before a knee injury ended his career. In a sense, his miracle catch cost him his job.\n\u2013 The catch was ruled a touchdown on the force out rule. Now, the rule states a receiver must get both feet in bounds. Previously, the ref could rule a force out, predicting that had the receiver not gotten pushed out, his feet would have come down in bounds. This season ending play helped lead to a rule change.\n\u2013 The Cardinals were victims of bad karma down the road. The catch that eliminated the Vikings in \u201803 looked eerily similar to Santonio Holmes catch in Super Bowl 43 that knocked off Arizona.\nIf you are still unable to name the receiver that became the hero on one unlikely play, don\u2019t worry\u2026 you are not alone. The answer is in our piece NFL Films Presents: Undercover Receiver."}

They spend the day roosting in huge mango trees in the street, and at dusk they take to the skies in clouds of leathery wings and an ear-splitting cacophony of screeching. After circling for a few minutes, they head off towards the north.\nThese bats are enormous: the largest have a wingspan of nearly 3ft. But they're not scary, mainly because they have cute furry faces (they are also called flying foxes) and they eat only fruit, not blood. Not yet, anyway.\nA perhaps slightly less cute image from our time in Cairns was of yours truly fetchingly clad in tight-fitting Lycra to protect me from near-lethal jellyfish as I went snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef. Not that I cared. I swam ecstatically among clouds of brightly coloured fish and even past a (harmless) small reef shark, and I formed what I liked to think was a deep and meaningful relationship with a large and brilliantly iridescent parrot fish. I will never eat one of those again.\nWe have now passed the halfway mark in our six-month voyage around the world and still find that every day brings some new experience \u2013 or tribulation.\nSo far we have frozen in Cape Town, watched whales breaching in Hermanus in the Cape, fallen in love with a beach on the Garden Route, swum literally to the very edge of the Victoria Falls, traversed astonishing mountain passes, seen an abysmal production of Julius Caesar at the Sydney Opera House Playhouse, cuddled a koala and touched the atmospheric and strangely moving sandstone of Ayers Rock.\nAustralia was our second stop after South Africa, and we were surprised and delighted with the style and sophistication of Sydney and Brisbane. The architecture leads the way with that famous Sydney Opera House turning out to be even more impressive than expected. The whole of Sydney's enormous harbour was a treasure trove of surprises and delights while, inland, some of the shop windows reminded me of those in Paris.\nWe also loved Ayers Rock (or to give it its Aboriginal and official name, Uluru). We expected to be impressed by the rock from afar \u2013 particularly at sunset. But the next morning we got close up and, despite the 40C (104F) heat, walked around it for an hour and a half. We had not expected the wonderful shapes and undulations and crevices, the impossible overhangs and the deep indentations and almost sculpted spires. It was then that we understood why this is such a sacred place to the Aborigines.\nWhat has not been so delightful in Australia has been the discovery of just how expensive everything is, especially the food. Even in quite modest places we have found ourselves paying huge amounts \u2013 \u00a325 to \u00a328 and upwards for a main course in a pizza joint. It's partly due to a very unfavourable exchange rate and partly due to the fact that Aussies seem to be very well-heeled. It is true that we could have eaten cheap street food but, hey, we are senior gappers after all, and we like a chair and table to sit at.\nI'm afraid we have failed miserably to stick to our budget of \u00a3100 a day for food and incidentals \u2013 especially during a three-night stay at the Queensland coast resort of Hamilton Island, where all the restaurants were expensive"}

But considering the euphoria of playing in March Madness and how critical matchups are for advancing to the second weekend, well, the cast of decision-makers isn't getting off the hook that easy.\nCincinnati, the AAC tourney winner, should've been a No. 5 or No. 6 seed. The committee gave the Bearcats (28-6) a No. 7 seed in the South Region. While it's rather generous that they'll be playing in nearby Columbus, this seed makes us wonder if the committee even watched the American Athletic Conference tournament championship that ended right before the selection show. Cincinnati beat a really good Houston team in the final and had a much better profile to be in the range of a No. 6 seed or even No. 5 seed. It could be a blessing in disguise because of the location and how dangerous the No. 11 and No. 12 seeds are in this bracket.\nNCAA TOURNAMENT BRACKET: All 68 teams revealed!\nSnubbing UNC-Greensboro for St. John's: The Spartans (28-6, 15-3 Southern) were undoubtedly worthy of making the field of 68 given their overall profile in which they only lost to Quadrant 1 (top-30 home, top-75 away) opponents.

Look at the Red Storm (21-12, 8-10 Big East) from a blind r\u00e9sum\u00e9 standpoint. They had a worse NET score of 73, a worse non-conference strength of schedule of 216 and lost five Quad 2 or Quad 3 games compared to UNC-Greensboro's zero. The committee shouldn't have just given one really good mid-major love, it should've given it to two.\nFlorida State, not Purdue or LSU, should've been a No. 3 seed. The Seminoles (27-7) have been overlooked all season, having been the fourth wheel to the ACC's three No. 1 seeds \u2014 Duke, Virginia and North Carolina. Did the committee see that UVA game? Apparently not. FSU had a top-16 NET score, a top-15 strength of schedule and eight Quad 1 wins. Comparatively, while Purdue and LSU have slightly better NET scores, Purdue lost two more games and LSU isn't the same team with coach Will Wade suspended for his alleged involvement in an NCAA violation.

Phil Scott defended his proposed budget before fielding questions from an audience primarily of students, touching on everything from the industries to the incentives that might keep some of those students in the state.\nMuch of what Scott discussed with students related to his campaign platform of \u201caffordability,\u201d a catch-all term referring more generally to Scott\u2019s goal of keeping taxes low and offseting increasing expenses through tax base-expanding development.\nAmong the policy proposals Scott defended was his paid family leave plan, a proposal that would have employees or employers voluntarily sign into an insurance system shared between Vermont and New Hampshire. An initial risk pool would be created by signing Vermont and New Hampshire state employees into the program.\nIt contrasts sharply with the mandatory, statewide family leave plan passed by the Vermont House of Representatives last week, funded through a payroll tax on employees, which employers can volunteer to pay. The plan offers more robust coverage than Scott\u2019s proposal.\nBoth proposals would be contracted through private insurance companies.\nScott, invoked the state\u2019s rollout of Vermont Health Connect, warning the legislature\u2019s plan would create an IT \u201cdebacle,\u201d which he contrasted with his and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s \u201cwalk before you run\u201d approach to family leave.\nWhen he turned the floor over to students, questions focused on Vermont\u2019s tech industry and the viability of incubators like Hula, currently being built along the lakefront in Burlington\u2019s South End. \u201cThey\u2019ve been largely successful,\u201d Scott said, dubbing them \u201canother tool in the tool shed\u201d for fostering growth.\nLater questioned on industry in Vermont, Scott would revisit technology alongside aeronautics and renewables as places where Vermont could see growth. He cited companies like Beta Technologies in Burlington, where an electric aircraft was \u201cbeing built right here in Vermont,\u201d and South Burlington\u2019s Dynapower.\nThese were places where he also saw cooperation with Canada, the state\u2019s largest trading partner and from which Scott said his administration has drawn several tech companies to Vermont.\nScott also fielded questions about housing development, answering both in reference to his the $35 million housing bond in the 2018 budget and a proposal to incentivize housing restorations with the caveat that they be energy efficient, paired with a proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax on land.\nThe survivability of Vermont\u2019s colleges was raised by a member of St. Michael\u2019s faculty, the question asked in reference to several high-profile closures in the state. It was a difficult question, Scott admitted, and one that spanned the whole of the Northeastern United States.\nScott said the question was made even more challenging by both limited resources and declining school enrollments at the elementary and middle- and high-school level. \u201cWhat are the ripples?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\nAn answer, he suggested, could come from partnering with other sectors for education opportunities. Offhand, Scott hypothesized nursing as one of those possible areas, as healthcare needs were growing while hospitals continue to be short-staffed.\nScott turned to his administration\u2019s incentives program, which would reimburse moving expenses up to $10,000 \u2013 spread over two years \u2013 for people who move to Vermont and work remotely. The program, he said, was a huge success, drawing 3,000 applicants despite the fact that only a couple dozen rewards could be given."}

The development\u2019s success has come at a cost to some drivers confounded by traffic backups and parking problems.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 One year ago, a sleepy corner of Southwest D.C. suddenly blossomed into a beehive of social activity.\nNow, business is booming at the District Wharf, a year after the 24-acre development\u2019s grand opening. An estimated 10 to 12 million people have headed to Washington\u2019s newest waterfront neighborhood, some taking advantage of new transportation options such as the Water Taxi and free jitney service.\nBut the rapid density change has made getting around the old-fashioned way, by car, a little more difficult. The development\u2019s success has come at a cost to some drivers confounded by traffic backups and parking problems.\nTraffic troubles notwithstanding, developers and most patrons see the first phase of The Wharf largely as a commercial and societal success, with another 1.15 million square feet of hotel, residential and retail space planned to open by 2022.\n\u201cThere are lots of ways to get to The Wharf without actually getting in a car,\u201d said Bob Rubenkonig, executive director of The Wharf Community Association.\nWhen The Wharf opened on Oct. 12, 2017, it brought a number of restaurants, retail shops and music venues to D.C.\u2019s Southwest waterfront. One year later, new businesses are still moving in. Here\u2019s a look at The Wharf\u2019s impact in its first year.\nThe development has parking for nearly as many bicycles as for motor vehicles \u2014 more than 1,000 bikes above and below ground, in addition to Capital BikeShare stations throughout the neighborhood.\n\u201cYou can get here by driving but I would also say walking, taking your bike, riding here on the Water Taxi \u2014 the jitney is a great way to go. The Wharf Shuttle is a free service that\u2019s pretty terrific as well, as the new Circulator route,\u201d Rubenkonig said.\nRubenkonig said the below-ground parking spaces for cars can be hard to come by. The parking garage, he estimated, reaches capacity about five days a week. The Wharf\u2019s social media team sends push alerts on their app, as well as alerts on social media, when the roughly 1,400 spaces are taken.\nWhen the garages are full, Rubenkonig suggests drivers \u201cthink about parking up at L\u2019Enfant Plaza and walking down the brand-new Banneker Overlook stairs. It\u2019s really easy and the view of The Wharf from the Banneker overlook is amazing.\u201d He also noted that there are many other public parking areas near The Wharf.\nThe new Circulator route opened earlier this year, connecting Eastern Market and L\u2019Enfant Plaza. The line runs down M Street and makes stops near The Wharf and Arena Stage.\nThe Wharf and its nearby partners in Southwest also operate a free shuttle service with 10-minute headways. The Southwest Neighborhood Shuttle has ferried about 40,000 people per month between the National Mall and The Wharf since it launched late last year.\nFor a more nautical experience, the free jitney carries travelers, and"}
{"idx": "4632", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As we reflect on the lessons learned through the big-data boom, of how organisations securely capture, store and retrieve data and how they can derive value from these huge data sets, we must begin to prepare for a yet another new wave of data.\nThis data will come from millions of new Internet enabled devices, a continued push towards the use of virtualised machines and the adoption of cloud enabled business-critical applications.\nThis volume will make it more important than ever for organisations to holistically manage their data and storage more intelligently, and cloud services will be a key element to achieve this. Although the cloud has been around for a few years now, it is only recently that organisations started to really understand how to leverage it to suit their business needs. More than simply shared hard drives in the sky, today we see an increasing array of enterprise-level cloud services from virtual computers to fully realised Enterprise applications.\nHowever, what are the latest trends and services brought by the cloud and how can organisations now seize the opportunity to leverage on these new functions to enhance their business capabilities.\nWe predict that enterprises, rather than continuing to spend capital in their own datacenters, will become increasingly comfortable utilising big public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Dimension Data and RackSpace. The cloud is becoming more adept at allowing the use of data-intensive applications, e.g. SharePoint, Oracle or SAP. Currently, most organisations are knowledgeable about all of the different cloud service models (Infrastructure IaaS, Platform PaaS, and Storage SaaS) and the focus appears to be moving up the stack towards the application layer. In response, providers will likely grow their applications-as-a-service offerings, providing a broader range of alternatives to the traditional on-premises infrastructure.\nOrganisations should therefore, already start researching the right vendors, start executing their cloud strategy, and get used to managing the IaaS layer. 2015 will also undoubtedly see PaaS as its zenith. Recent trends show an increasing number of organisations are investing resources into implementing guardrails around their cloud environments so that developers can consume the cloud services in a secure and compliant manner. At the same time, they are also \u2013 or should be \u2013 either evaluating PaaS or doing a proof of concept with one or more PaaS platforms.\nIt is now time for applications and developers to enter the ring. Ultimately, this move to manage some resources in-house and put others into the cloud will reinforce the need for a hybrid cloud strategy.\nWorking with cloud service providers provides organisations with the ability to take advantage of the private cloud. In fact, a growing number of enterprises are consolidating their IT infrastructures to private/public clouds. The growing importance of hybrid cloud environments is transforming the entire computing industry, as well as the way businesses are able to leverage technology to innovate.\nOne clear benefit of a hybrid cloud model is having on-premises, private infrastructure directly accessible \u2014 in other words, not having to go via the public Internet for everything. This greatly reduces access time and latency in comparison to public cloud services. The hybrid cloud model gives the ability to have on-premises computational and storage infrastructure for processing data that requires extra speed or high availability for your business, while retaining the ability to leverage the public cloud for failover circumstances or when the workload exceeds the computational power of the private cloud component.\nBuilding out the private end of a hybrid cloud also allows for flexibility in virtual server design. Organisations can automate the entire virtual machine lifecycle to archiving older Virtual Machines (VM\u2019s) to the cloud. Some organisations are also looking at private compute clouds to provide"}

At least she was never drugged or given alcohol by her mother as a child just so she would fall asleep before it was time for business, the last resort of women working in Kamathipura.\nHer mother was divorced and worked at Kamathipura to support them, but Lakshmi didn\u2019t have to live there or bear the stigma attached to it.

Prerana started a night care centre at the Kamathipura Municipal School in 1986. The centre opens at 5.30pm and children are provided food, shelter and tuitions until their mothers pick them up the next morning. Preeti Iyer, project director, Prerana, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous and exploitative environment to grow up in. For mothers who feel their children are unsafe even in our shelter, we provide them with options outside the area.\"\nLakshmi\u2019s mother wanted her children as far away from Kamathipura as possible. Lakshmi and her younger brother and sister studied in an English-medium school and lived at a rented house in Thane with a caretaker, till Lakshmi was 6.

Heroin abuse can be detected either through signs on the body of the user or by typical addictive behaviors such as erratic mood swings, compulsive theft and nodding off. Use of dirty needles can also lead to contraction of hepatitis and HIV, either of which will present further physical symptoms that combine with the symptoms of addiction.\nThe most definite sign that someone is using intravenous drugs is the presence of \"tracks,\" meaning small red marks, pin pricks or bruising, usually on the inside of the elbows, the most common place to inject drugs. Remember, however, that these marks alone don't indicate heroin use; diabetics and others also use needles for health reasons.\nAnother physical sign of heroin use is very constricted pupils in the eyes, even in dim light. This occurs because the heroin relaxes the muscles in the body, causing the retina to close.\nHeroin is a highly addictive drug, which means that many people who don't necessarily want to be using it continue to use it because they feel a physical need for it. Addicts who are unable to acquire the drug legally often turn to theft to finance their habit. Someone who is constantly stealing, borrowing or selling off his possessions but never seems to have any money may be addicted. Heroin addicts are also prone to \"nodding off\" immediately after a fix, meaning that they enter a somnambulent state that isn't exactly asleep or awake, but from which they can't be roused.\nLong-term heroin addicts exhibit signs that are more serious than those listed above. Hard-core addicts may lose a great deal of weight and appear unhealthily thin. Their skin may take on a pale color and exhibit decreased turgor, meaning that if the skin is pinched up into a ridge, it tends to stay there rather than returning to a smooth state. General health may suffer as a result of heroin addiction, resulting in poor teeth, bad digestion and other problems. Many of these problems may be exacerbated or even caused by the personal neglect that is often a result of addiction, rather than by the drug directly."}

These events expose the troubling reality that, far too often, the Church\u2019s instincts are no different than from those of many other institutions, responding to such allegations by moving to protect her structures rather than her children. This is a longstanding problem in the Christian world, and we are deeply grieved by the failures of the American and global Church in responding to the issue of sexual abuse. We do not just believe we should do better; as those who claim the name of Jesus and the cause of the Gospel, we are convinced we must do better. In the hope that a time is coming when Christian leaders respond to all sexual abuse with outrage and courage, we offer this confession and declare the Good News of Jesus on behalf of the abused, ignored and forgotten.\nThrough the media we have been confronted with perpetual reports of grievous sexual abuse and its cover-up. Institutions ranging from the Catholic Church, various Protestant churches and missionary organizations, Penn State, Yeshiva University High School, the Boy Scouts, and all branches of our military have been rocked by allegations of abuse and of complicity in silencing the victims. And while many evangelical leaders have eagerly responded with outrage to those public scandals, we must now acknowledge long-silenced victims who are speaking out about sexual abuse in evangelical Christian institutions: schools, mission fields and churches, large and small. And we must confess we have done far too little to hear and help them.\nHolocaust survivor and author, Elie Weisel, once said, \u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim\u2026silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\u201d When we choose willful ignorance, inaction or neutrality in the face of evil, we participate in the survival of that evil. When clergy, school administrations, boards of directors, or military commanders have been silent or have covered up abuse, they have joined with those who perpetrate crimes against the \u201clittle ones\u201d \u2013 often children, but also others who are on the underside of power because of size, age, position or authority.\nIt goes without saying that sexual abuse is criminal, but within the Church we also believe that it is the work of the enemy of our souls \u2014 evil, horrific sin perpetrated in dark and hidden places, forever altering lives and destroying the faith of the abused. How could such evil be present and overlooked in the body of Christ? Surely as his followers, we would do everything in our power to expose the deeds of darkness, opening the mouths of the mute, the afflicted and the needy. The Church must never hinder those who so desperately need to run to God and his people for safety, hope and truth, while also providing them protection from the great deceiver.\nBut we have hindered the victims.

They're for getting rid of the kinds of low-frequency, ambient noises that you experience on a plane or a train, or if you sit near a low-pitched hummer at work. They won't cancel out a shriek or a beep or anything in the upper register, but for frequent travelers, they\u2019re an earsaver.\nPreviously, Bose's noise-cancelling magic has only been available in wired form, in the QC25 and QC20. No wires means more convenience, though, which is especially important in a device that exists mostly to facilitate naps in fast-moving modes of transit. Just pop them on or in your ears, and enjoy the silence. Or decent music. They rely on Bluetooth for connectivity, which means you can expect some loss in sound quality when streaming tunes from your phone or laptop to the headsets, but the noise cancellation shouldn't be affected. They also come with NFC chops, meaning all you need to do to pair them is hold your smartphone up to your right earcup.\nYou'll get a listed 20 hours of battery life out of the over-ear QC35, and about half that on the buds. The latter, by the way, have adopted the increasingly popular wrap-around, skinny-neck-brace form, while the over-ears look like the Bose you're already familiar with. They\u2019re both joined for the first time by an app (because wireless) that lets you modify the noise cancellation levels. Voice prompts control caller ID, and dual-mics in each headset should make for clearer hands-free phone calls.\nThen again, if you\u2019ve got noise-cancelling headphones on in the first place, you're probably not picking up the phone!

Vava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u is not only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but also a safe place in times of natural disasters, and is therefore known as the Port of Refuge. As such it is a fitting venue for Ministers from the region to gather and discuss the very full agenda of trade related matters.\nTrade is integral to all of our economies, whether it be a reliance on imports to sustain our people, a reliance on exports to obtain foreign currency, a reliance on taxation being generated from trade, even as we try to move away from this model, a reliance on tourism and service exports to again contribute to our national and regional economic interests.\nEven for a small island like Vava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u, trade is integral to its economic survival. In the past, crops such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvanilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were export products and significant income generators for the people of Vava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u. It is my hope that through progress made in on-going regional trade negotiations, will again contribute to Tonga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export position. It is no doubt that the most significant contribution to this island is through tourism, and trade in services, including our workers benefiting from existing labour mobility schemes to New Zealand and Australia.\nTourism work has also estimated that the whales here in Vava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u may be worth in excess of over One Million Pa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anga. It is vital that we work to open niche markets such as these to connect trade opportunities, but that we maximise the development assistance that supports trade agreements to our respective benefits as is the focus of the work on Aid for Trade.\nI wish to acknowledge the efforts of Minister Lisiate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAkolo who has worked closely with the Forum Secretariat to arrange the first ever Pasifiki Trade Fair to be held here in Vava\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u tomorrow to showcase the products from the island and to capitalise on the visit from our Pacific Trade and Invest Commissioners. Pacific Trade and Invest is another example of the support needed to build our marketing linkages for goods and services, and we are very pleased to have the Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trade Commissioners from New Zealand, Australia, Japan and China with us for this event.\nI am informed of the demanding range of issues that awaits your consideration in this meeting, including: PACER Plus and how we can build a way forward with our trading partners and development partners in the face of changing priorities, and what may have been perceived as a slow start, the functionality and deliverables to date and the high expectations for the forward work-plan, from the now formally incorporated Office of the Chief Trade Adviser the critical development and marketing support provided through the focus on trade facilitation, and the Aid for Trade agenda, and finally, a review of where we are with progress on the broader trade negotiation programme for the region.\nTonga believes PACER Plus is integral to our growth and development.

Last Thursday Australian federal police deputy commissioner Peter Drennan told a Senate estimates committee that Abdellatif had been convicted of premeditated murder and possession of explosives.\nThe allegations and the fact that Abdellatif had been placed under a severe \"red notice\" warning by Interpol since 2001, prompted Julia Gillard on Wednesday to call for an immediate review by the inspector general of intelligence and security of the way security services deal with \"high-risk\" asylum seekers. The furore over the case has plagued the prime minister over the past week in Canberra, with opposition politicians scathing about the fact that the immigration minister, Brendan O'Connor, was not told that Abdellatif had been housed in low-security detention up until August, when he was transferred to Villawood, a higher security detention centre in Sydney.\nOn Wednesday, Abbott said in question time: \"Given that a convicted jihadist terrorist was held at a family facility in the Adelaide hills for almost a year through what officials call a clerical error, will the prime minister now concede that Labor's policies have made Australia less safe than it was under the former government?\" He reiterated his criticism in parliament on Thursday.\nBut court documents seen by Guardian Australia, which appear to detail the convictions used to issue Interpol's red notice, make no record of a murder case or of any possession of explosives. The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR), an independent human rights body in Cairo, has verified the documents. Abdellatif's actual convictions, of being party to a criminal agreement and being a member of an illegal extremist group \u2013 under the rule of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt \u2013 were part of the \"returnees from Albania\" trial in Cairo in 1999, heavily criticised by Amnesty International at the time for using evidence allegedly obtained under torture.\nSpeaking to Guardian Australia, Abdellatif's Cairo lawyer, Muntassir al-Zayyat, said that his client was not accused or convicted of murder or bomb charges at the 1999 trial. Asked if Abdellatif had ever been accused or convicted of these offences Zayyat, who was speaking from Kuwait, said: \"Not at all. The accusations were only joining a secret organisation and being party to a criminal agreement to topple the regime [of Mubarak, who was later overthrown in the 2011 Egyptian uprising]. There was no killing mentioned at all.\"\nZayyat's office were unaware of any other charges against Abdellatif.\nA second lawyer, Majdi Salem, who also worked on the case, said that the 1999 charges against Abdellatif had been misreported.\nHe told Guardian Australia: \"There were no bomb-making charges. This detail emerged because at the time of the case, the local media often took their information from the Egyptian security services, and the sources were intentionally orienting the details to suit their own interests.\"\nThe developments follow comments from the foreign minister, Bob"}

Charles Bradford, who filed the case and represents himself, failed to show how he was personally affected by the closure of two elementary schools in Morehouse Parish.\nBradford argued through an original and amended petition that the closures would lead to overcrowding, increased segregation, create longer travel times for students and potentially cause the spread of Hepatitis A.\nHe also accused former board member Chip Rawls of living outside his district while continuing to vote and alleged that board attorney Steve Katz committed a criminal act by allowing it to continue.\nWhile Bradford is the grandfather to students who attended Morehouse schools and members of his church work for the district, Hayes noted in the the report that he did not show how either he was personally affected or how his grandchildren and congregants could argue for themselves in court.\nBradford initially filed the suit in November and requested a temporary order that would prevent MPSB from voting to close two schools as part of an overall reduction in force.\nThe judge denied that request, and the board approved the closure of H.V. Adams Elementary and Pine Grove Elementary in December. The schools were closed over Christmas break, and the district re-opened with consolidated campuses in January.\nIn both his original and amended complaints, Bradford asked the court to force MPSB to create a committee that would decide what action was in the children's best interests.\nHayes noted that a committee also could decide to close schools, so the relief he requested was unlikely to fix the unlawful acts he alleged.\nBradford included Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education District 5 representative Gary Jones and John White, the Louisiana superintendent of education, in his suit. He also ultimately named all members of MPSB who were serving in 2018 and board attorney Steve Katz.\nHayes noted that state law gives school board the ability to decide how many schools should be open and how many teachers should be employed, so BESE and the Department of Education had no say in this instance.\nAll the defendants asked the court to dismiss the suit based on lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nHayes recommends that the motions to dismiss be granted and the case be dismissed without prejudice.\nThe case will not be dismissed until a judge makes a ruling.\nAll parties have 14 days to file written objections for the judge to consider, and all parties have another 14 days to respond to any objections raised."}

The question may need to be adjusted a little, but many educators are reading, sharing, learning, and growing together. However, what are ways in which we can put these new ideas into action in a timely manner? I'm sure self-initiation, problem-solving, risk-taking and the freedom to fail and learn from such failure will be a part of the conversation. As a principal, I would love to have some strategies to close this gap.\nShawn's question is an important one, and several guests will be responding to his question over the next week.\nIn schools, I believe the key to \"closing the gap between new ideas and implementation\" is making sure that teachers are key in determining which new ideas are the ones being implemented. All too often, we are viewed by administrators, particularly many in school district central offices, as their \"instruments\" in executing \"flavor of the year\" programs.\nAnd why should administrators make that a priority? Because, if they don't, it's unlikely that they'll be effective.\nMany years ago, I helped operate a soup kitchen on San Jose's (CA) Skid Row. We were well-meaning, but not the most responsible neighbors. On day I was sweeping around the passed-out men and women on our front porch when a police car drove-up. An officer got out and started yelling me, saying that we couldn't control thing and they received many complaints about us. As the officer continued, one of the men on the porch pulled himself up on the railing and yelled out, \"Officer, Larry tries. He tries hard. We just don't listen to him!\"\nI've often thought about that incident during my nineteen year career as a community organizer and eleven years as a public school teacher. I've framed the lesson I learned that day as a question, \"Do I want to be right? Or do I want to be effective?\"\nIn my organizing career, I learned that a key to engaging people to move beyond their comfort zone is to first build a relationship -- a reciprocal one. A relationship entails eliciting from others their hopes and dreams, along with sharing your own. It involves finding learning the frustrations and challenges that people are experiencing. It involves looking for ways to help the other person realize those hopes and dreams and get beyond those challenges. And, if these \"new ideas\" can genuinely help in those ways, then building a relationship means framing the invitation to try it in a way that speaks to what the other person wants, which may not be the way the \"idea person\" would prefer to frame it. It is the difference between \"being right\" and \"being effective.\"\nUp until the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson was a master \"implementer.\" Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and many others tell a story about his arrival in Washington, D.C. as a Congressional aide. He lived in a boardinghouse with other aides -- and took four showers each night and brushed his teeth five separate times in the morning so he could get to know the interests of his colleagues.\nMany years later, as President, he still understood that he had to talk personally with as many Congressmen as possible, to learn what they needed to make them feel important. So, he would invite individual Congressmen and Senators to breakfast, to lunch, to dinner. He would call them at 6:00 in the morning. If they weren't up, he would talk to their wives.\nCreating a legacy is key.\nThough the \"goodies\" can be important tactical tools, during my organizing career,"}

That\u2019s the case for others in Orland and Hamilton City, as well, he said.\nAnother man complained that all along, viewers were told stations would switch to digital on Feb. 17, but now three Chico-based stations will make the shift on Monday, and he\u2019s not ready.\nAbout 100 people attended the meeting at the CARD Center Thursday afternoon. The event was organized by the Federal Communications Commission and featured brief presentations by managers of north-valley TV stations. The whole nation is on the verge of a switch to digital television. In most places, the change will occur Feb. 17. In the north valley, things are happening sooner.\nKIXE, which runs PBS 9, went entirely digital in August. And on Monday, Sainte Partners, which operates FOX 30, and Catamount Broadcasting, which has NBC 24 and CBS 12, will follow suit. The fifth local full-power station, ABC 7, will wait until Feb. 17.\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, Roger Goldblatt, an FCC official, called the switch to digital the biggest thing to happen in television since color pictures.\nThe impact may be even bigger, he said, if you didn\u2019t have a color set, you still got a black-and-white picture. With the change to digital, some viewers may get no picture at all if they haven\u2019t taken certain steps.\nPeople who have cable or satellite service should automatically receive digital signals. And those with newer sets containing digital tuners should be fine, as well. It\u2019s people who receive signals over the air and use older analog TV sets, who need to do something.\nThe easiest solution for these people may be to get a digital converter box and keep using their same TV, Goldblatt said. Two other options would be to buy a digital television or to sign up for satellite or cable TV.\nMyron Tisdel, general manager of KIXE, recommended those who can no longer view his station move around their rabbit-ears antennas, and if that didn\u2019t work, try using an outside antenna.\nJohn Stall, Catamount\u2019s general manager, said there\u2019s no need to buy an expensive antenna. Any UHF antenna should do, he said. The managers said the more expensive converter boxes seem to work best. They also advised buying a box with a \u201cpass-through\u201d feature that allows receiving both digital and analog signals.\nA woman who said she was disabled and lived on Social Security asked Stall if the government would help her buy an antenna. He said it probably wouldn\u2019t. But free coupons are available from the government to help buy converter boxes. For information on how to get them, call 1-888-DTV-2009 or visit www.DTV2009.gov on the Web.\nThe station managers said if people have problems receiving their digital signals, they should call the stations for help.\nGoldblatt said Congress ordered the switch to digital to free up space on the air waves and to improve the quality of television signals and sound."}

But where's the payoff for the business?\nOf the many competitive strengths that investors typically credit Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) for having, marketing is one of the biggest. After all, the consumer goods titan boasts the largest advertising budget on the market, with almost $5 billion of annual spending.\nThere's a less well-known piece of P&G's marketing program, though, that involves simply giving away free stuff. The company has ramped up what it calls \"sampling\" initiatives lately -- in hopes of winning back market share. Management sees the trial programs as worthwhile investments, but that's debatable since they don't carry the type of payoff that a new ad campaign or product launch might quickly deliver.\nProcter & Gamble sells a lot of diapers. At $9 billion of annual revenue, in fact, the franchise is easily P&G's single biggest brand.\nThe company also gives away tons of these products. Through partnerships with hospitals around the country, it put trial versions of its Pampers baby products in the hands of 70% of new moms last year. Executives credit this massive sampling program with helping deliver strong market-share gains against Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) Huggies brand. With its Pampers and Luvs brands, P&G now accounts for 45% of U.S. diaper share, up from 36% in 2009.\nP&G also gave away 2 million samples of its Fusion razors in the last year. The company targets young men by providing them trial products near their 18th birthday so that, ideally, they become repeat customers.\nIts market coverage has been impressive. Roughly 80% of this target demographic received a P&G-branded shaving product this year.\nThe grooming segment was P&G's worst performer in fiscal 2016 as the company had trouble defending market share from value-based rivals and from online-subscription shaving services like Unilever's (NYSE:UL) Dollar Shave Club. Trends are looking better at the start of fiscal 2017, though, which is giving management hope that it could soon return to above-average growth in this highly profitable segment.\nAnchored by the Tide detergent brand, Procter & Gamble's fabric care division is held up by CEO David Taylor and his team as an example of the type of innovation-powered sales gains they want across the portfolio. \"Fabric care results demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium,\" Taylor told investors in a recent conference call.\nSampling has been a key contributor to that success. P&G boosted its trail giveaways to 17 million units last year from just 5 million in the prior year. Management's plans call for a further near-doubling of the program for the current fiscal year.\nA consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing net spending because it was not producing, it never produces immediate short-term results.\nP&G pulled back on its trial programs a few years ago as part of its huge cost-cutting initiative.

Since August 2018, more than 1,200 people are believed to have contracted Ebola in Congo; 764 have died. And the outbreak has worsened significantly in recent weeks, with 20 new cases confirmed Thursday alone, according to Congo\u2019s Health Ministry.\nWHO has only used its highest level of alert in four previous health crises, most recently during the 2016 Zika epidemic, when the mosquito-borne virus was believed to be causing brain damage in infants. The group used the same designation for the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, a 2014 polio outbreak in Pakistan and Syria, and in 2014 to confront a widespread Ebola outbreak in West Africa that ultimately left more than 11,000 people dead.\nBut on Friday, Robert Steffen, chair of WHO\u2019s expert committee that met to address the Ebola outbreak, said at a news conference in Geneva that his team decided that \u201cthere would be no added benefit\u201d to declaring the outbreak a global emergency, in part because the virus has not spread over the border into neighboring countries.\nInstead, he called for efforts to control the disease to be redoubled. \u201cWe cannot lean back and relax,\u201d he said.\nThis latest Ebola outbreak is the deadliest since the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa that caught WHO off guard. The international body faced serious criticism over its handling of that outbreak and has acknowledged that it could have done more sooner.\nThis time, health workers want to make sure all that can be done is done quickly to stop the spread of the virus.\nIn Congo, the Ebola response has been complicated by the community\u2019s deep-seated distrust of outside intervention \u2014 a dangerous backdrop to the outbreak of a deadly, highly contagious disease. Armed groups have intimidated health workers, and in February, two health centers run by Doctors Without Borders were attacked, forcing the international medical group to suspend its operations in the epicenter of the outbreak.\nTrish Newport, a representative for Doctors Without Borders, said the outbreak is definitely \u201cnot under control right now.\u201d She said that many of the confirmed cases have been community deaths, opening up the possibility for the infection to spread to those who came into contact with the victims before they died. And in about 75 percent of new cases, health workers have not been able to identify where patients contracted the virus, Newport said.\nThat can hamper the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, which have historically been based on a \u201cring\u201d that identifies individuals who have had contact with someone diagnosed with Ebola and builds out from there.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t change our approach, we aren\u2019t going to get the outbreak under control,\u201d she said.\nJ.

The outstanding exception, to date, is his performance in Judd Apatow\u2019s \u201cFunny People,\u201d which showed what happens when he works with directors who tap into the depth of his talent. I eagerly await seeing him in Noah Baumbach\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d which will premi\u00e8re at Cannes next month. In the meantime, owing to Sandler\u2019s ongoing production deal with Netflix, there\u2019s \u201cSandy Wexler,\u201d the latest feature that he has made for the company; it was released there last Friday, and I watched it so that you don\u2019t have to.

Sandy is painfully awkward in as many ways as possible\u2014physically, verbally, emotionally. He represents his clients with a fanatical devotion that translates poorly into practical exertions. He\u2019s always on the hustle, and part of the hustle is the lie\u2014the lie of strategy, the lie of vanity, the lie of consolation, the lie of self-defense. He brazenly lies about what he is doing right in front of his clients\u2019 eyes, but he does so with such a childlike earnestness that they don\u2019t hold it against him\u2014and, in any case, they can\u2019t afford to hold it against him, because they likely couldn\u2019t find anyone who\u2019d even pretend to believe in them as fanatically as Sandy does sincerely.\nSandy\u2019s perpetually on the Atkins diet\u2014he eats only varieties of meat\u2014and his table manners are famously awful. (He\u2019s known to inadvertently soil his face with pieces of that meat.) His wardrobe is son-of-leisure suits in no-iron blends, and he has the odd habit of apologizing to his various outfits if he hasn\u2019t worn them in a while.

Those foreigners had been barred by an executive order signed by the president on Jan. 27.\nThe legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day, prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s filing sought to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the Seattle judge\u2019s decision and asked that the lower court\u2019s ruling be stayed pending the appeal.\nIn its argument for an appeal, the Justice Department had said the president had an \u201cunreviewable authority\u201d to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners. It said the ruling by Judge Robart was too broad, \u201cuntethered\u201d to the claims of the State of Washington, and in conflict with a ruling by another federal district judge, in Boston, who had upheld the order.\nThe Ninth Circuit court moved quickly to reject the administration\u2019s appeal, a measure of the urgency and intense interest in the case.\nJudge Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declared in his ruling on Friday that \u201cthere\u2019s no support\u201d for the administration\u2019s argument that \u201cwe have to protect the U.S. from individuals\u201d from the affected countries.\nHis ruling also barred the administration from enforcing its limits on accepting refugees. The State Department said Saturday that refugees, including Syrians, could begin arriving as early as Monday. Syrians had faced an indefinite ban under the executive order.\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s vehement criticism of the ruling and the certainty that it would be appealed, the government agencies at the center of the issue, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, moved quickly to comply.\nLawrence Bartlett, the State Department\u2019s director of refugee resettlement, wrote in a departmental email that officials were working to rebook travel for refugees who had previously been scheduled to leave for the United States over a three-week period that will end Feb. 17.

Cruz delighted in torturing animals, bragging about it and posting gruesome pictures on social media.\nWhile liberals attack Republicans for failing to limit access to assault rifles, and President Trump attacks the FBI for failing to follow up on a tip that Cruz might have been planning a killing spree, Thompson and others insist that law enforcement could have identified Cruz as a serious risk if they had paid attention to his history of animal abuse.\nWhile the nation argues about how best to respond to the proliferation of mass shootings, researchers have found that one way to limit mass killings would be to identify those at greatest risk of committing these types of crimes.\nThe FBI received a tip with concerns about suspected Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz but protocols were not followed and it was not investigated.\nLas Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock posted pictures on social media of bloody animals he had killed.

The move comes two months after the U.S. pulverized its six-ton stockpile of ivory contraband to signal that it will not tolerate the illegal wildlife trade, and one month ahead of a major international summit on wildlife trafficking to be held in London. But just how committed China is to combatting wildlife crime remains unclear.\nPoaching of Africa\u2019s savanna and forest elephants has reached levels that threaten the future of these species: tens of thousands of animals a year are being slaughtered for their tusks. The vast majority of the demand for the ivory comes from China, whose burgeoning middle class has a seemingly insatiable appetite for this traditional symbol of wealth.\nIn a letter sent to foreign embassies and other groups, China\u2019s State Forestry Administration noted that wildlife trafficking has become a serious problem and explained that it would be destroying the ivory \u201cfor the purpose of raising public awareness, and demonstrating Chinese government\u2019s resolve to combat wildlife trafficking,\u201d according to a translation. The Wildlife Conservation Society observed in a news release that the ceremony follows on the heels of a story on the costs of the ivory trade that ran on the front page of an influential Chinese newspaper in November and went viral in China, reaching millions.\nBut in contrast to the U.S., which destroyed its entire stockpile of illegal ivory, China destroyed only a small portion of its much larger stockpile at today\u2019s event. Indeed, Hong Kong alone has a hoard of some 30 tons of confiscated ivory. What is China going to do with the remaining contraband? Furthermore, what is it going to do about its legal domestic ivory trade, which provides cover for illegal trade? If China is serious about tackling wildlife crime, it will need to address these concerns. China is not alone in this latter regard\u2014the U.S. and other countries also have legal ivory markets that allow for the laundering of illegal ivory, and these loopholes need to be closed--but the stakes are that much higher in China because it is responsible for as much as 70 percent of the global demand for ivory."}

The admission was buried in more than 600 pages of documents released by Brazil's federal court system this month, detailing the testimonies of Mr Barusco who struck a plea bargain in November.\nResponding to Mr Barusco's accusations, Rolls-Royce said: \"We want to make it crystal clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\"\nThe accusations come as Rolls-Royce also faces a Serious Fraud Office investigation in the UK over allegations of bribery and corruption in China and Indonesia. They also come as the company is undergoing a painful restructuring, revealing its first fall in underlying sales in a decade and predicting a bigger than expected fall in profits in 2015.\nRolls-Royce is the latest foreign company alleged to be involved in Brazil's Petrobras scandal, which threatens to engulf the government of President Dilma Rousseff only two months into her second term and push the country's most important company into technical default.\nBrazil's authorities are already investigating allegations that Petrobras officials accepted bribes from SBM Offshore, a Netherlands-based supplier of offshore oil vessels. SBM has said it is co-operating with the investigation.\nUnits of two Singaporean companies, Keppel Corporation and Sembcorp Marine, along with three Brazilian shipbuilders with large Japanese shareholders, have also been accused of participating in the bribes-for-contracts scheme. Keppel and Sembcorp have denied the allegations.\nThe Petrobras scandal emerged when the former head of the oil company's refining unit, Paulo Roberto Costa, also struck a plea bargain after being arrested for money laundering in March.

Analysts estimate the scheme has cost Petrobras more than $20 billion.\nThe PT said the allegations are without proof and has promised to sue the \"accusers\".\nIn the latest testimony, Mr Barusco, who helped set up Petrobras's major rig supplier Sete Brasil after a 30-year career at the state-controlled company, said the kickback scheme was managed by several \"operators\" or agents who acted on behalf of groups of companies.\nMr Barusco alleged that his friend Luiz Eduardo Barbosa, a former"}

Think John Carpenter's Escape From New York (1981) or The Thing (1982).\nDespite Foster's credible performance, however, this movie will be forgotten in a month.\nWriter-director Drew Pearce makes his feature debut, after a career spent mostly on screenplays (Iron Man 3, 2013; Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, 2015).\nNearly all the action takes place inside the building, once a grand hotel, now functioning like a Swiss bank of hospitals.\nThe Nurse accepts the worst of the worst without moral judgment. A group of dangerous patients are trapped inside because of the insurrection outside. Each hatches plans to turn the situation to his advantage.\nPearce mixes a range of tones, including the closed-in paranoia of horror classic The Thing, the escape-room thrills of Foster's earlier film, Panic Room (2002), all wrapped in a noir-ish look that recalls Blade Runner (1982).\nIt is a bold mix, but marred by a lacklustre visual-storytelling style; everybody labours over exposition in dialogue.\nThere is a fatally mushy, predictable arc for Foster's character.\nFinally, the screenplay contrives suspenseful traps for its characters, only to toss them ex-machina escape hatches in the nick of time."}

Developed by Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends borrows popular elements from already-established genre leaders, while mixing in a few new gameplay elements for good measure.\nHaving launched on Monday, February 4 \u2014 with no prior announcement or reveal \u2014 the Electronic Arts-published free-to-play shooter has already established a dedicated fanbase, thanks to the game\u2019s emphasis on strategy, speed, and a silky smooth frame rate. In fact, Apex Legends is already shattering expectations for what a free-to-play console shooter can accomplish.\nAs detailed on Electronic Arts\u2019 official website, Respawn Entertainment\u2019s CEO, Vince Zampella, penned a blog post detailing Apex Legends\u2019 massive success, taking the time to thank players for flocking to the game and supporting the studio. Some gamers might recognize Vince Zampella from another popular series. Zampella was one of the original co-founders of Infinity Ward, the studio which went on to develop the long-running Call of Duty series. After a fallout with publisher Activision, Zampella and other Infinity Ward developers left the company, creating Respawn Entertainment.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apex Legends has managed to reach the 10 million player milestone in only three days. In comparison, Fortnite took two weeks to reach the same mark, as detailed in a tweet from the game\u2019s official Twitter account.\nNot unlike Blizzard\u2019s popular hero shooter Overwatch, Apex Legends features eight playable heroes, each with their own unique abilities and personality. Unlike other battle royale games, Apex Legends does not feature fall damage, and players have a chance to revive an eliminated teammate, by collecting their player-specific \u201cbanner\u201d and calling in a dropship. Respawn Entertainment has also included a robust \u201cpinging\u201d system, allowing players to communicate and share important info without the need for headsets and voice chat."}

Everybody in the whole world does all their own styling. They wake up in the morning and put their own clothes on themselves.

Pat Buchanan has been speaking and writing about it for decades. So have Kevin Phillips, Paul Krugman, Paul Stiles, David Sirota, Naomi Klein, and Bill Moyers. Lou Dobbs is the latest convert to the movement. We are Americans: check your hyphenated nomenclature at the gate.

It's the largest verdict against the company that has sold Baby Powder and Shower to Shower brand talcum powder for decades.\nA jury ruled in Johnson & Johnson's favor in one lawsuit in California last November. In October, a judge reversed two verdicts in favor of the company. A Missouri appeals court tossed out a $55 million verdict in June citing jurisdictional issues.\nIn 2006, the International Agency for Research in Cancer, which falls under the World Health Organization, decided to classify the use of talc in the genital area as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans.\" In the US, government agencies and medical associations that track what causes cancer believe the topic needs more research to know for sure.\nThe US National Toxicology Program, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, keeps a congressionally mandated list of \"agents, substances, mixtures, and exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to cause cancer in humans.\" Talc is not among the 248 listed; however, in 2010, when it was up for consideration to be included in the list, the agency explained that it has not fully reviewed talc as a possible carcinogen.\nA separate but related set of lawsuits suggest Johnson & Johnson's powder is contaminated with asbestos. Asbestos, a well-known cancer-causing agent, is often mined near talc. A New Jersey couple was awarded $117 million after after the husband claimed the J&J powder he inhaled gave him mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure.\n\"For over 40 years, Johnson & Johnson has covered up the evidence of asbestos in their products,\" Mark Lanier, lead trial counsel for the women and their families, said in a statement. \"We hope this verdict will get the attention of the J&J board and that it will lead them to better inform the medical community and the public about the connection between asbestos, talc, and ovarian cancer.\"\nDoctors have noticed that talc particles have been in cancer tumors for decades, but it's been unclear how the contamination happened and if it led to the cancer. The women in this case claim to have all used talc based powder for decades to keep their bodies smelling fresh and clean, particularly in their genital area.\nIn a statement following the ruling, Johnson & Johnson said it is confident its \"products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer,\"\n\"Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed.\""}

Although that\u2019s not quite what it sounds like as that includes all microtransactions, subscriptions, and DLC.\nOverall the UK video games industry generated \u00a33.864 billion in revenues last year, over \u00a33 billion of which was digital. That\u2019s a 12.5% increase for digital sales on 2017, but physical sales saw only a modest drop of 2.8%. Overall the games business in the UK saw an increase in sales of 9.1%.\nNone of those numbers are very extreme, and yet 2018 was filled with news stories of big-name franchises \u2013 everything from FIFA to Tomb Raider \u2013 suffering from massive drops in physical sales, anything from 25% to over 50%. At the time it was unclear if that was just because of an attendant increase in digital sales, but evidently that wasn\u2019t the case.\nFor mass market games like FIFA 19 physical sales still count for the majority, at around 75% \u2013 although in FIFA\u2019s case that is down from 80% in 2017.\nFIFA 19 sold 2.5 million copies in the UK, including digital, but that\u2019s down on FIFA 18 which sold 2.7 million. And yet this in turn is further complicated by the fact that EA makes the majority of its money now from microtransactions.\nThis can be cross-referenced with data from the Entertainment Retailers Association to show that FIFA 19 was actually the second best-selling entertainment product of any kind in the UK in 2018, behind only The Greatest Showman on DVD and digital.\nThis is similar to 2017, where FIFA 18 was behind only an Ed Sheeran album.\nAlthough video games don\u2019t always come out on top, at \u00a33.864 billion the games market as a whole is worth more than either video (\u00a32.34 billion) or music (\u00a31.33 billion).\nIn terms of formats, both Sony and Nintendo did well, with PlayStation 4 accounting for 48% of all boxed sales in the UK \u2013 although that\u2019s slightly down on 2017.\nSony was also the fifth biggest publisher of the year, although they were easily beaten by Nintendo \u2013 despite the company\u2019s thin release schedule in 2018.\nEA was the number one publisher, just, but that hides a disappointing year for the company, with its share of the physical games market down from 22% in 2016 to just 14.7% last year. Chart-Track confirms that this was due to lower sales of both FIFA 19 and Battlefield V.\nAcitvision Blizzard were also down 4%, with Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 selling less than Call Of Duty: WWII. Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey from Ubisoft and Fallout 76 from Bethesda also saw less physical sales than their predecessors.\nChart-Track has promised to add digital sales to their charts at some point this year, which will help to give a more consistent picture, but it does seem as if many big-name franchises are selling less than they used to \u2013 and yet at the same time making the same or more money thanks to microtransactions and DLC."}

So the Disclaimer folks clearly pushed some buttons when they scripted a piece about sexism in the workplace that was rife with sexist stereotypes.\nWhat was their intent? Where do they come down on questions of gender equality at work? And are some topics just too hot too be funny? Those are just a few of the questions spinning out of the debate over the Disclaimer\u2019s latest salvo.\nTo help answer them, Xpress has gone to the source: the woman who created and co-produces the Disclaimer. Our conversation with her appears below, but first, a bit of background.\nMichele Schevefounded the Asheville Disclaimer in 2002, and it lived for three-and-a-half years as a freestanding publication. Along the way\u2014and through her publication (but that\u2019s another story)\u2014Michele met her husband, Tom Scheve, who today co-produces the Disclaimer feature. When the couple stopped publishing in early 2006, Xpress persuaded them to contribute a one-page version to our newspaper on a weekly basis.\nNow, with a number of readers rankled about the substance and timing of the Women in Business parody, we asked Michele to explain what, exactly, she and Tom are trying to accomplish with their often-raw satire.\nBelow, a conversation with her about the business of parody.\nMountain Xpress: Is your Women in Business parody sexist, as some are claiming?\nMichele Scheve: It\u2019s meant to be silly and a parody of sexism, in its actuality and perception. The bit was audacious and overboard by design. It had an over-the-top quality that was intended to suspend belief.\nMX: Does it inadvertently legitimize sexism?\nMS: There is always the argument that there is someone out there who won\u2019t \u201cget it,\u201d and that this person will process a given bit as being supportive of that which is being satirized\u2014in this case, an over-the-top sexist attitude. We can\u2019t start trying to protect dumb people from their own opinions. Also, nobody has ever admitted to being this dumb person or knowing them personally, but a lot of people assume this person is out there poring over satirical news articles in alternative newsweeklies, so dumb they forgot to put on their pants this morning; alone and naked in the world, unable to process local media in a manner that does not put others at risk.

Yun explained that the ratio in many areas moved slightly downward in 2015 compared to 2014 as builders started to respond accordingly to local supply shortages.\nHowever, Yun noted that it will likely be multiple years before inventory rebounds in many of the markets because homebuilders continue to face a plethora of hurdles, including permit delays, higher construction, regulatory and labor costs, difficulty finding skilled workers and the exhausting process many smaller builders go through to obtain financing.\nAccording to the latest housing start report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, homebuyers could soon receive much-needed relief from the competitive housing market and increasing home prices as housing starts increased in July both monthly and annually.\nThe newest housing start report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is slated to come out early Tuesday morning."}

It also contained some disturbing details like a sizable drop in business spending and a slowdown in exports. But ADP's earlier report of 220,000 jobs added in April gave support to the idea that hiring is picking up and that much of the first quarter's sluggishness was weather-related.\n\"I do see a lot of weather in here. The inventories was a big loss, but that's something that sets the stage for better growth going forward,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. \"It was weaker than expected. You see the weather imprint but you see more than the weather imprint.\"\nThe Fed is expected to issue a statement at 2 p.m. EDT after a two-day meeting. It is widely expected to continue winding down its quantitative easing bond purchases by another $10 billion to $45 billion and make slight tweaks to its statement.\n\"This may color how they talk about the economy. It may not be as optimistic as some expected,\" Swonk said. But she thinks the Fed will go on with its plans to taper quantitative easing.\nStocks were subdued, initially weaker on the GDP report, but higher in late morning trading. Treasurys were higher after the report, and the 10-year yield, which moves inversely, fell to 2.66 percent.\n\"The fact that you've not heard anyone say the word 'recession' and equity futures were flat tells you all you need to know,\" said Daniel Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. \"This is being written off appropriately as not a qood quarter but it's largely weather impact.\"\nThe GDP report gave a number of clues about the weather impact. Consumer spending on goods rose only 0.4 percent as cold weather slowed shopping trips, shut businesses and closed schools, but total consumer spending rose at 3 percent. That was largely due to spending on energy to heat homes and on health care, possibly as more consumers signed up under the Affordable Care Act.\nJ.P. Morgan economists already knocked down their forecast for first quarter growth to zero, following government revisions Wednesday to retail sales data for the first quarter. The 3 percent increase in consumer spending, therefore, slipped to a 2.9 percent pace, they wrote in a note.\n\"It looks like the economy hit an air pocket in Q1. It stalled out. The share of the weak growth can be attributable to the temporary weights on the economy. Weather probably cut 1 point from growth. The expiration of emergency unemployment insurance cut as much as a half point, and of course the inventories subtracted just over a half point. If you add that up, the economy grew 2 percentage points in Q1, but that's still weak,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\nThe economy was growing at a pace of 3.4 percent in the second half of last year, and many economists expect the current quarter growth to show the spring back effects after record snowfalls and cold dampened spending and business activity. Zandi said the weak number does not change his expectation for 3.5 percent second quarter growth.\n\"I'm thinking we could see big revisions"}

{"idx": "4737", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Is the District looking for ways to cut service and increase costs for residents and businesses? That\u2019s what will happen, at least, if the D.C. Council adopts a proposed ordinance that would institute a taxi medallion system in the city and could cut the number of taxis serving the public in half.\nThere goes the neighborhood \u2014 literally \u2014 as taxi drivers inevitably would abandon low-margin trips in outer neighborhoods such as Anacostia to concentrate on the milk runs to the airport or serve higher-income customers along K Street and Capitol Hill.\nThat conclusion may seem exaggerated, but other cities that have restricted taxicab availability have had that kind of result. It\u2019s simple economics. Drivers focus on fares that generate the highest return, and their ability to do so will increase as competition becomes more limited.\nMedallions are metal plates issued to vehicles authorized to operate as taxis. Medallions have been around for decades in some cities and were widely adopted during the 1930s as an attempt to limit competition from new cab companies.\nThe big winners in a medallion system are large existing companies. Once medallion systems are put in place and the supply is restricted, as the D.C. ordinance explicitly aims to do, the price of medallions goes through the roof. In New York, medallions sell for upward of $600,000. The going price in Boston is $400,000. Even in small taxi markets such as Columbus, Ohio and Minneapolis, taxi medallions and licenses have sold for more than $25,000.\nThe average wage for a taxi driver in the D.C. metropolitan area hovers around $32,000 per year, and a medallion system would quickly squeeze out the little guy. These workers can have trouble making ends meet as it is, and start-up entrepreneurs are easily overwhelmed by the challenge of getting the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed just to buy a plate giving them permission to drive. As a result, medallions essentially relegate drivers to working for a big cab company. Rather than funnel revenue into buying (or upgrading) their vehicles, these drivers shell out thousands of dollars each year in leases to medallion owners.\nMeanwhile, the big cab companies lock in their dominant position by borrowing to buy up more medallions, making it virtually impossible for a company to start from scratch. Indeed, the initial deal proposed in the District\u2019s ordinance is pretty sweet. If you\u2019re a company that has been around for 30 years or more, you will have to pay an initial price of $500 for an unrestricted medallion. If you\u2019re a company younger than 20, the cost will be $5,000.\nThat creates some fast revenue for the city, but the real benefit would accrue to the cab companies after the initial sale because the ordinance creates an instant shortage by limiting the number of medallions to 4,000 (in a city with 10,672 licensed cabdrivers and 116 licensed companies). This virtually guarantees a black market for medallions and huge increases in price.\nThe biggest losers in this system, however, are likely to be outer neighborhoods such as lower-income sections of Southeast and Northeast. With substantially fewer taxis available to meet demand, drivers will pick the most lucrative routes.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happened in other cities with medallion systems.

{"idx": "4738", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Agriculture provides the main support for Zambia\u2019s rural economy, and because of this, growth in the agricultural sector is the clearest avenue through which poverty reduction can be achieved in Zambia. Sixty seven percent of the Zambian population depend on agriculture, primarily through smallholder production for their livelihoods and employment. Zambia recognizes agriculture as one of the key priority sectors in achieving sustainable economic growth and diversification away from copper mining.\nThe Food Reserve Agency -FRA- recently made a decision to set the floor price of a 50 Kilogram bag of white maize at 60 Kwacha under the 2017 crop marketing exercise. The FRA further announced that it will restrict its grain purchase to 500,000 metric tonnes of grain as National Strategic Reserve (NSR) in line with Government policy guidelines and will no longer sell grain to millers who will be expected to buy their own grain. However, the FRA will enhance community sales and sell to vulnerable communities and favour programmes such as Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit, Correctional Facilities, Ministry of Education -home grown school feeding programme and hospitals.\nThe FRA\u2019s original mandate was to establish and administer a national food reserve alongside private grain trade and to serve as a buffer stock to cushion grain price variability and provide liquidity in the grain market. Over the last two decades the FRA has engaged more actively in the market by exceeding its prescribed target, and has often bought more than double the prescribed quantity. In particular FRA usually buys above the market price for maize; and then sells maize to the millers at a subsidized rate. This FRA activity in maize marketing in Zambia is partly because of the Government\u2019s desire to resolve the \u201cfood price dilemma\u201d by ensuring that maize producers get a higher price, on the one hand while maintaining mealie meal prices at affordable levels for consumers, and particularly the vulnerable households.\nA floor price is the lowest legal price a commodity can be sold at. Price floors are used by the government to prevent prices from being too low. Price floors are often used in agriculture to try to protect farmers.\nFor a floor price to be effective, it must be set above the equilibrium price. If it\u2019s not above equilibrium, then the market won\u2019t sell below equilibrium and the floor price will be irrelevant.\nIn the case of maize in Zambia the floor price is raised above the price set at equilibrium, so the demanders (consumers) aren\u2019t willing to buy as much quantity. The demanders will purchase the quantity where the quantity demanded is equal to the price floor, while on the other hand, since the price is higher than what it would be at equilibrium, the suppliers (producers) are willing to supply more than the equilibrium quantity.\nBuy up all the surplus and sell it at a cheaper price. This often lead to subsidization of millers and re-sellers who do not pass on the full benefit of this subsidy.\nGovernment can strictly enforce the floor price and let the surplus go to waste. This means that the suppliers that are able to sell their goods are better off while those who can\u2019t sell theirs (because of lack of demand) will be worse off.\nThe Government can control how much is produced. To prevent too many suppliers from producing, the Government can give out production rights or pay people not to produce. Giving out production rights will lead to lobbying for the lucrative rights. If the Government pays people not to produce, this might create an influx of producers demanding to be paid.\nIn the end, a floor price has negative impact on society more than it"}

The Schenectady Planning Commission gave final approval to the project Wednesday.\nThe Board of Zoning Appeals earlier this month granted a variance, allowing the project to go forward with no designated parking spaces instead of the required nine.\nSalvatore Rasizzi, a construction contractor, said he plans to put two stores and six apartments in 105 Clinton St. He\u2019s a Queens resident who became interested in Schenectady when he and his wife visited the city, drove around and liked what they saw.\nHaving St. George Greek Orthodox church next door was an extra selling point for his wife, Helen, who is of Greek descent.\nRasizzi said eating dinner at Mexican Radio and watching the crowds come out for the holiday parade this year were extra selling points for him.\n\u201cThese are the kind of reasons I said I'm going to buy this building,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the Labor Temple is a nice structure with a lot of potential -- and one notable challenge: the third floor.\nThe building appears from the exterior to have four floors, but there actually are only three. The top floor\u2019s ceiling is twice as high -- 16 feet -- as the first- and second-floor ceilings because the top floor is the original meeting hall.\nRasizzi hopes to divide that into two levels, but he\u2019ll seek and follow the advice of an architect and structural engineer. If creating a fourth floor is not possible, he\u2019ll figure out another way to adapt the space.\nApproval for the apartment project ends a century-plus chapter in the history of organized labor in the Electric City.\nThe Schenectady Labor Temple Association was incorporated on Aug. 29, 1907. It purchased the lot on the corner of Clinton and Liberty streets in 1914 and began construction of the building that bears its name soon after.\nWhen it opened, the temple became home to more than 30 unions, from bricklayers to wood and wire lathers.\nThe temple housed many other unions over the course of a century, but in recent years was down to just one: Laborers\u2019 Local 157.\nAn administrator said the local had called the temple home since the building's construction, and the union's current leadership, staff and members still loved the space.

The belief is that a person may have one or two energies that are stronger than the other, or all three of them could be equally present. Each of these energies have their own unique set of characteristics. When in balance, these energies help people operate at maximum level. When out of whack, a person may feel lethargic, anxious or angry.\nFood and drinks are known to have nurturing, energy efficient properties that coincide with your dosha, which, \u201ccomes from a Sanskrit word meaning, \u2018that which can become polluted or imbalanced, or fall into disrepair\u2019,\u201d said William Courson, dean of academic affairs and institutional development at the Sai Ayurvedic College of Miami.\nIt is an ancient Ayurvedic belief (Ayurveda is also known to be a 5,000-year-old medicinal practice) in which people have three main energy centers in the body \u2014 Pitta, Kapha and Vata \u2014 fire, earth and water. Or, to put it simply, some food is bad for you and will make you feel drained, while other foods will keep you light and focused.\nAt the end of the day, he said, it is all about balance.\nTrying to balance the inner-dosha may seem like a tall order for students, who constantly lack time and a breadth of money, but Courson strongly believes that the reason Ayurveda works so well is because it\u2019s preventative.\nCourson said that his experience working with patients has repeatedly supported one of his main messages - that committing to preventing health problems is more cost effective than waiting for a problem to become too big to manage.\nAre you someone who runs hot, even when it is technically cold outside? Are you intense about your work and passionate about your hobbies? Do you eat fast, talk fast and sweat easily? Do you have an insatiable appetite? You have a strong presence of Pitta.\nMinimize your intake of spicy, salty and sour foods (stay away from that hot sauce and sharp cheddar cheese).\nAlso, try to give yourself a daily massage, since Pitta oriented people have a tendency to store the intensity in their neck and shoulders.\nAre you a naturally mellow person who likes to stay in your comfort zone? Are you friendly and love bear hugs and see the goodness in everything? Do you enjoy nightly doses of Netflix? Is it difficult for you to motivate when your bed seems like such a better option?

The Category 5 hurricanes that slammed into the Virgins Islands in 2017 were different because they occurred two weeks apart. Not only did Irma devastate the islands Sept. 6th, but also, it left St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix exposed and defenseless when Maria hit Sept. 19, 2018.\nRoads were clogged with storm debris. Power was out. Public schools were destroyed or severely damaged. Hospital patients were evacuated, and major hotels were forced to close for extended periods of repair time.\nDuring the last seven months, the islands' commercial sector has experienced an amazing renaissance, thanks in part to $800 million of federal aid. FEMA, the Army Corp of Engineers, and other government and private organizations have rebuilt the islands' infrastructure. Power has been restored. Cruise ships have returned. Restaurants have reopened, and commercial flights are back. In essence, you would be hard-pressed to identify storm damage in the business district of Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, the capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nWhat isn\u2019t back are jobs, rooftops, larger hotels, and the general prosperity enjoyed before the storms hammered the islands. A good part of the aid money was directed toward reestablishing the tourist industry that is so critical to the islands' economy. In addition to rebuilding the business district, FEMA allocated grant money of $49 million for home repairs, approved $454 million for SBA home repair loans, and funded the installation of 3500 blue tarps for temporary roof protection.\nResearch done by The Washington Post indicates that more than 18,500 home and businesses were either destroyed or damaged. To further exacerbate the situation, most residents, excluding nonresident vacation homeowners, could not afford expensive storm insurance. In other words, the U.S. Virgin Islands may be open for business, but their future depends on finding ways to rebuild the homes of locals, many of whom support the tourist industry.\nAll Hands and Hearts is a volunteer organization that is assisting homeowners and schools that don\u2019t have the resources to rebuild. It is difficult to give them enough credit. They are currently based in a condemned middle school, sleep in three different classrooms, and use the cafeteria as a tool shed and office. Their people work long hours in hazardous environments as nonpaid volunteers. They must find their own transportation to and from the islands, sleep on air mattresses that they bring, take ninety-second showers, and save the shower water for toilet use.\nVolunteers for All Hands and Hearts provide their own mattresses.\nDuties include tree and vegetation removal, eliminating mud, muck, and silt from water damaged buildings, tearing out and removing construction materials from ruined homes, and cleaning and drying salvageable remnants from destroyed structures. Once this work is completed, they rebuild schools and add roofs to some of the damaged houses they cleared and cleaned.\nIn early March, I teamed up with Connor Shafran, marketing content creator for All Hands, to document their home and school restoration work using data we collected from drone flights.

{"idx": "4758", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the newspaper industry on our nation\u2019s politics, so she did some research, which has been published in the Journal of Communication.\nIf you have noticed what seems like a sharp increase in political polarization in the past few years, you are not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities, found out, that polarization happened during a period of steady decrease in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country.\nAccording to the report, fewer local newspapers and \u201cwatchdog\u201d journalists means less opportunity to get information about local politicians and governments. Those without a local newspaper to read turn to national news sources, some of which try less strenuously to avoid taking one political side or another. Their feelings about national political figures, then, tend to trickle down to local politicians of the same party \u2014 again, because they have been given less information about the local folks.\nIf you think such a change in the way people are able to consume their news means little in the big picture, consider this, from the report: In 1992, 37 percent of states with Senate races elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate that state supported. In 2016 \u2014 for the first time in 100 years \u2014 not a single state displayed such a division.\nResearchers have also found lower voter participation among those news-deprived citizens, particularly in off-year elections (that\u2019s the kind of stuff unscrupulous political officials dream about when it comes time to shove through what would normally be an unpopular ballot measure, for example). Communities without local newspapers \u2014 and therefore without the journalists working at those newspapers \u2014 see an increase in government spending. Why worry about tossing a few extra bucks the way of your favorite contractor when no one is paying attention anyway, right?\nDunaway even found citizens\u2019 reliance on national news sources changes the way politicians campaign.\n\u201cThey have to rely on party \u2018brand names\u2019 and are less about \u2018how I can do best for my district,'\u201d she said.\nOf course, Mid-Ohio Valley residents know they can count on the News and Sentinel to keep them informed about local and state officials and issues. They know we will continue to do our best to provide the information they need.\nAnd if you think that\u2019s no big deal, take a look at what is happening in the growing number of communities who do not have a local newspaper to ask their politicians what they are trying to hide \u2014 what they hope you won\u2019t find out.\nLocal newspapers are important, ladies and gentlemen. There are only 7,100 of us left in the entire country. There were nearly 9,000 only 15 years ago. Without us, the politicians and their parties have a much easier time making the electorate serve them, rather than the other way around.\nThat is not as it should be."}

This age-old practice is still an excellent way to propagate many types of plants, including vining or soft-stem varieties of philodendron (Philodendron spp.). Prepare a philodendron cutting and place it in water. The cutting will grow new roots. While you can plant it in a flowerpot or in the garden after it roots, the philodendron is one of the few houseplants that can grow in water permanently.\nFill a clear jar or container with tap water, leaving 1 inch of space beneath the rim. Let the water sit overnight to allow time for chlorine to dissipate.\nRemove a 6-inch stem from a healthy philodendron plant. Make a clean cut with a pair of scissors, gardening clippers or a sharp knife, cutting the stem just below a set of leaves.\nPinch off two or three sets of leaves so at least two leaf nodes on the stem are bare. Suspend the leafless end of the cutting in the water. The upper leaves should rise above the top of the container and the bare leaf nodes -- where the leaves were removed -- should be in the water.\nChange the water every three days, allowing the water to sit out overnight before you change it. In about 10 days, the stem will start to form roots.\nMove the philodendron to a bright location, but not in direct light. Place the plant near a north- or west-facing window or at least 3 to 4 feet from a south-facing window covered with sheer curtains.\nHeart leaf philodendron (Philodendron cordatum) and velvet leaf vine (Philodendron micans) will grow in water.\nHouseplants placed in direct sunlight may burn; add sheer curtains to the window to diffuse the sun's rays.\nLewis, Melissa. \"How to Grow a Philodendron in Water.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-philodendron-water-24834.html. 28 November 2018."}

There are so many of them that you'll always find a few to agree with you. Take Europe's current refugee crisis: Rather than swaying hearts and minds, the emergency seems merely to have hardened and confirmed previous prejudices and opinions, of whichever stripe.\nReactions to the crisis range from the openly hostile to the warmly hospitable. Both extremes can be fed from the same set of facts. For instance, the current distribution of Syrian refugees.\nSyria's neighbours are bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis, and have done so for a lot longer than the current crisis. Turkey alone hosts around 2 million Syrians. That's half of the total number of Syrians who fled their country; almost 1 in 10 of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million; and more than any other country.\nLebanon is the temporary home of 1.2 million Syrian refugees, a remarkable feat considering its own citizenry numbers no more than 4.5 million. This means that Syrians now constitute almost a fifth of Lebanon's population. The number of Syrians in Jordan, a country of 8 million, officially stands at 630,000, but in reality may be much higher. There are even a quarter of a million Syrian refugees in Iraq. How bad must things be before you tell your family: \u201cOkay, enough with all the violence. Pack your bags; we're moving to Baghdad.\u201d?\nShouldn't European countries, therefore, be more generous towards Syrians requesting asylum? A counterargument from the same dataset: What are other Arab countries doing for Syria? As confirmed by Amnesty International, the number of resettlement places offered to Syrian refugees by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain is zero. How about they step up?\nBut the reality is that people are casting off their rickety boats in the direction of Europe, not Arabia. And not just to Europe in general, but to a few countries specifically.\nThe situation at the moment is very fluid. Perhaps the best idea to get a clear picture of it is to take a step back. The maps below reflect the situation on the Old Continent in the first quarter of this year, i.e., before the present influx. Produced by Dutch public broadcaster NOS, they show where the 185,000 asylum requests were filed.\nThese maps are cartograms \u2014 ordinary maps distorted to reflect one statistical dataset, in this case: the number of refugees per million inhabitants. In other words, they reflect the relative impact of the refugee crisis on the countries of Europe.\nFor the sake of calibration, first a normal map of Europe (to be precise: the western half of Europe), with the population sizes per country. Then, that same map reflecting the relative size of the refugee population. Germany keeps its size because it is the benchmark: It not only has the largest population (81 million), but also has the largest number of asylum requests per 1 million inhabitants (905). That works out to 73,305 asylum requests, or about 40 percent of the total quoted above.\nSome other remarkably popular destinations \u2014 relative to the countries' own population \u2014 are Malta (811 asylum requests per million inhabitants), Switzerland (507), and Luxemburg (482), all swelling up to several times their geographic size.

AARP estimates Hawaii would lose $1.9 billion in total federal and state Medicaid funding from FY2020 to FY 2026.\nThe legislation contains an age tax, which allows insurance companies to charge older consumers five times more for the same health coverage as a younger person and reduces tax credits that help lower- and moderate-income people pay for insurance. It will make insurance unaffordable for many older residents. AARP estimates a 60-year-old Hawaii resident making $30,000 annually could pay up to $4,450 a year in additional premiums and $1,276 more each year in deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. Premiums for a 60-year-old earning $55,000 in Hawaii could rise to as much as $8,661 more each year.\nAbout 268,116 Hawaii residents are between the ages of 50 and 64 and a little more than half of them, 54 percent, receive tax credit assistance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe AARP state analysis estimates that one out of every eight Medicaid beneficiaries, about 43,000 people by 2026, would have to lose coverage to maintain the same level of service for remaining beneficiaries.\nThe bill would also hurt kupuna in nursing homes and providers who care for people in nursing homes and at home, who could see reduced payments because of the Medicaid cuts.\nPayments to nursing facilities accounted for about 75.5 percent of Medicaid long-term services and support payments in 2014. Home and community based services are optional in Medicaid and could be more vulnerable to cuts.\nBut cutting home and community-based services could have the unintended consequence of increased hospital admissions and increased use of more expensive services that will ultimately cost the federal government more.\nEven people who get their insurance through their employer face higher costs because the bill allows states to weaken important consumer protections that ban insurance companies from capping how much they will cover annually, or over a person\u2019s lifetime. States could also weaken or waive requirements that protect consumers from high annual out-of-pocket spending, such as deductibles and copays.\nThe bill would also affect about 44,237 Hawaii residents ages 18 to 64 who leave or lose their jobs and who may have to buy coverage on the individual market.\nAbout 190,634 Hawaii residents, 73 percent of those 50 to 64, get their insurance through their employer.

However, Katie Finnegan, who oversees Store No. 8, has stated the retail experiences being worked on won't be seen for at least five years and possibly not for another decade.

So it makes sense it\u2019s not going to keep doing that,\u201d said Brian Waldes, Breckenridge\u2019s director of finance.\nAt $12.4 million, Breckenridge general retail sales were up 4.57 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking another strong month for the town and helping offset any losses at the restaurants and bars, which were down 1.85 percent. Lodging was also off in Breckenridge and down 3.33 percent, while grocery and liquor was 2 percent behind September 2017, marking the second straight month of declining grocery and liquor sales.\nConstruction experienced the most dramatic month-over-month gain for Breckenridge, jumping 33.09 percent over September 2017. However, the spike was attributed to a large sales tax return filing.\nMeanwhile, the town\u2019s marijuana sales surged 4.67 percent in September, but the industry makes up only a small fraction of the town\u2019s total tax base. Through the first nine months of 2018, marijuana recorded $7.7 million in sales. By comparison, lodging ($129.1 million), retail ($121.7 million), and restaurants and bars ($109.6 million) are all far outpacing weed sales year to date.\nDespite some of the monthly swings, every sector in Breckenridge except two \u2014 construction (minus 4.75 percent) and utility (minus 5.72 percent) \u2014 is trending up in year-to-date assessments.\nIn Silverthorne, the town saw its first month-over-month decline in sales tax revenue since October 2017. Still, the small 1.2 percent dip was mostly due to a one-time deduction from the county sales taxes, revenue administrator Kathy Marshall explained via email.\nEven with the adjustment, the town\u2019s estimated sales tax revenue was only down $12,415 in September compared to September 2017.

Investigations revealed that contractor and in-house engineers had warned prior to the launch that the unusually cold temperatures on shuttle systems the previous night and that morning could have catastrophic effects.\nAlso disclosed was the fact that NASA had known for years that the O-ring joints on the shuttle\u2019s solid rocket boosters were unsafe but planned to keep flying while they were being re-engineered. But concealed was the takeover of NASA by those in charge of President Reagan\u2019s Star War program along with the fact that NASA launched against the concerns of engineers in order to have the Teacher-in-Space mission in orbit in time for President Reagan\u2019s planned state-of-the-union address that night.\nBut the Teacher-in-Space was itself a smokescreen for the radical militarization of space that has received new impetus today from the ongoing takeover of the U.S. government by the Neocons. Thus the Challenger disaster was a warning to us all of what happens when technology is abused by covert political agendas and when lies and cover-ups replace honest inquiry.\nMy name is Richard C. Cook. Over 30 years ago I was the NASA analyst turned whistleblower who disrupted the cover-up the space agency had begun of the known causes of the space shuttle Challenger disaster when I released the O-ring documents to the press within 10 days of the January 28, 1986, explosion.\nI did this because I had been conducting an internal investigation of NASA\u2019s longstanding knowledge of the potentially deadly flaws in the solid rocket booster O-ring joints and knew, as did agency management, that it was these flaws that destroyed Challenger and killed its seven astronauts. But I could not make myself keep silent when the officials in charge were concealing what they knew and expecting staff professionals like me to go along with it. It simply would not have been the right thing to do.\nNew York Times journalist Phillip Boffey won a Pulitzer Prize for the articles he wrote on the documents I handed him at the Times\u2019 Washington, D.C., bureau. Boffey\u2019s articles paved the way for all subsequent news disclosures and investigations. But it was obvious to NASA I was the leaker. I was set-up for public attack and humiliation, fled the agency for fear of retribution, spoke and wrote publicly for several years afterwards, then kept my Challenger files for almost two decades until I published my account in book form in 2007.\nThus, 21 years after the disaster, on my retirement from the federal service, I published Challenger Revealed: An Insider\u2019s Account of How the Reagan Administration Caused the Greatest Tragedy of the Space Age. Despite a Starred Review from Publishers Weekly, the book has been almost completely, probably purposely, ignored by the mainstream media and attacked by the usual shills on the specialty web sites and chat rooms. But I have never backed down from what I had to say.\nMy book is the only complete account, either in print or the visual media, of one of the signature events of the 20thcentury.

Nor might Raytheon, the maker of the Patriot missile system which Washington is selling all over the world, because its stock went up by a modest five dollars, from $194.03 to $199.75. Perhaps they will be named by Trump the next time he makes a speech telling his country\u2019s bemused allies to buy US weapons.\nTrump also declared that \u201cWe have many wealthy countries with us today [July 12 at the NATO Conference] but we have some that aren\u2019t so wealthy and they did ask me if they could buy the military equipment, and could I help them out, and we will help them out a little bit,\u201d which made it clear that poorer countries that want to buy American weapons will probably not have to put cash down for their purchases. So it wasn\u2019t altogether surprising that the stock prices of the three arms manufacturers named by Trump all rose by over ten dollars.\nTo further boost this bonanza, the State Department did its best to make US arms sales even easier by enabling weapons manufacturers to avoid the well-constructed checks and balances that had been in place to ensure that at least a few legal, moral and economic constraints would be observed when various disreputable regimes queued up to buy American weapons.\nThere was yet more boosting by Lt-General Charles Hooper, Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, who declared at the Farnborough International Air Show on July 18 that \u201cDefense exports are good for our national security, they\u2019re good for our foreign policy. And they\u2019re good for our economic security.\u201d He then proposed that his agency cut the transportation fee charged to foreign military sales clients, which would be a major stimulant for sales of \u201cthe best jets, the best missiles, the best guns\u201d so valued by Mr Trump. Obviously a devoted follower of his President, the General followed the Trump line with dedication by reminding the media that \u201cas the administration and our leadership has said, economic security is national security.\u201d This man just might go places in Trump World.\nBut he won\u2019t go as far as the arms manufacturers, whose future growth and profits are assured under Trump and the Washington Deep State, which is defined as \u201cmilitary, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly manipulate government policy.\u201d US weapons producers have realised, as said so presciently two thousand years ago by the Roman statesman, Cicero, that \u201cthe sinews of war are infinite money,\u201d and their contentment will continue to grow in synchrony with their financial dividends.\nWithin European NATO, the biggest spenders on US arms, thus far, are Poland, Romania, Britain and Greece, and the amounts involved are colossal. Poland, whose economy is booming, has signed an agreement to buy Patriot missile systems for $4.75 billion, adding to the purchase of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles for $200 million, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, costing $250 million, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems for the same amount.

That bitter fight led to lawsuits, raids by the feds and criminal prosecutions of church critics. The criticism of the church has been the same for more than 15 years \u2014 that it\u2019s a cult which charges believers thousands of dollars for trainings and uses strong-arm tactics to keep members and critics in line. The church\u2019s line hasn\u2019t changed either \u2014 we are misunderstood and we will use the law to silence critics.\nThe Hatfields to the church\u2019s McCoys are itself a cultish group of loosely-organized hackers known as Anonymous, which \u201cdeclared war\u201d in January 2008 after the secretive religious group tried to suppress a creepy Tom Cruise video produced for Scientology members. After that incident the leaderless group organized online attacks, leaks of embarrassing internal church doctrine documents and protests outside of Scientology buildings around the country.\nA month ago a teen Anonymous member pleaded guilty in federal court to a computer hacking charge for his role in distributed denial-of-service attack that last year shuttered Church of Scientology websites. Two weeks ago Wikipedia banned the church from editing any articles.\nMostly, media just stay away from the story or generally cast the organization in a bad light. Enter public relations and a checkbook. In what Church of Scientology spokesman Ingo Lehmann told wired.com was a reaction at least in part to the Anonymous campaigns, the church began a campaign of TV commercials and Flash ads on May 17 designed to lure eyeballs to scientology.org, where there are hundreds of videos and testimonials (though they don\u2019t say really much about the Church\u2019s teachings). It plans to keep running ads through the end of the year. Interested viewers can go see the ads for themselves at http://thescientologyvideo.blogspot.com.\nDisconnect seems to play a big part in all of this: Lehmann sent out the Twitter screenshot in this article along with a press release about the campaign. He described the Tweeters as surprised. A better description might be that every Tweet in the screenshot was either offended or cynical.\nOur own experience was similar. Readers in Belgium and the UK tweeted us about scientology ads they saw on Wired.com last week and we responded that we had sold no ads to the church.\nOn Wednesday, Cond\u00e9 Nast Executive Director Josh Stinchcomb clarified that some Wired.com ads are sold through Google Adsense. The company does not comment on what advertisers appear on the site through that program, though this was apparently the source of the Scientology ads on Wired.com.

After missing the cut in Hawaii, Daly flew overnight to California and drove to Las Vegas for a session with Butch. They didn't have time then to have a heart-to-heart--that came last week. Instead, they worked on Daly's wedge game and Butch sent him off to the Hope in search of some hope. Daly wasted it. A muscle in his rib popped, prompting an emergency call to large-armed Jim Weathers, the shiatzu master and chronic-pain specialist who tried to knead Phil Mickelson's left wrist back to health during last year's Memorial. Weathers' arms are as big as an offensive lineman's, but they weren't long enough to wrap around Daly's abundant frame for the adjustment.\nSoon after, John was spotted at some parties, singing \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" with Meat Loaf and doing excessive amounts of the things Harmon said he wouldn't tolerate. There were rumors of a suspension and of rehab, and the following week Daly met with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem at Torrey Pines. Privately, Harmon said he was done with Daly, but with Daly there always seems to be one more chance, and Butch gave him one.\nThey met last week in Las Vegas and the conversation didn't revolve around shortening Daly's backswing or how to cozy a 90-yard wedge shot to a back-right pin. \"We had a man-to-man about changing his personal life,\" Harmon said Tuesday from the Titleist Test Center in Carlsbad, Calif., where he was working with Adam Scott. \"I told [John] to look in the mirror to see the guy who's causing all the problems. On tour, he needs to stay on his bus, stay out of the Hooters and the bars. I told him, 'If you can't do that, we don't have a deal.\"\nHarmon added, \"I gave him one hall pass. One is all I'm going to give him.\"\nAs for Daly's being replaced as the tour's man of the people, well, there is no replacing him. J.D. is one of a kind. He's part Elvis Presley and part Babe Ruth. Part Britney Spears and part Walter Hagen. He's a character from a Jerry Springer episode, a supernatural talent who has seen better days. Harmon is the old cornerman playing Burgess Meredith's role from Rocky, involved not because he needs the headaches, but because he still sees the potential.

{"idx": "4812", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Should Boston schools get rid of busing? Some say the money would be better spent in classrooms, but the answer is not clear. Here\u2019s why.\nThe Boston School Department spent $122.5 million on school transportation last school year.\nIn a city where school buses criss-cross neighborhoods, taking some students to high-performing schools but too many others to lackluster ones, some city and school officials are now raising one of the most contentious questions since the days of court-ordered desegregation: Should Boston get rid of busing?\nCity Councilor Annissa Essaibi George has been the most vocal, taking to social media last week, exclaiming, \u201cThose dollars would be better spent in the classroom, directly supporting kids!\u201d Boston School Committee Chairman Michael Loconto raised a similar point during a School Committee meeting, noting Boston has among the highest per-student busing costs in the nation.\nThe city spent $122.5 million on school transportation last school year.\nBusing students across the city has been the subject of bruising debates over four decades in Boston. The discussion intensified last week in the wake of a new report by Northeastern University that revealed a four-year-old computerized system used to assign students to schools is exacerbating segregation and leaving many black and Latino students in low-performing schools, even though tens of thousands of students get bused every day.\nThe findings have created immense frustration for city and school officials who had hoped the assignment system, which affects kindergarten through grade eight, would allow more students to attend quality schools close to home, in an effort to simplify the assignment process and save on busing costs. But the unfortunate reality is that Boston has too few good schools to go around.\nFor that reason, many parents, elected officials, and school leaders remain adamantly opposed to eliminating busing. Among them: Miren Uriarte, a School Committee member, who criticized Loconto\u2019s suggestion during last week\u2019s meeting.\n\u201cWhat that means is there is going to be more and more segregated schools. If we are willing to live with that, then we will go in that direction, [but] I\u2019m not willing to live with that,\u201d said Uriarte, eliciting cheers from some parents and advocates in the audience.\nFor many families, the yellow buses represent opportunity for a better education in another neighborhood. But many other students wind up at schools no better than the ones they pass by.\nThe latter fact irks some politicians, educators, and parents, who contend the school system\u2019s transportation budget is too high and complain about inefficiencies, such as late-arriving school buses. A frustrated City Council for the past few years has pressured the school system to reduce costs, but spending has nevertheless increased.\nYet if school officials were to try to eliminate busing under its school assignment plan, they would not wind up with $122.5 million at their disposal, according to budget figures.\nThat\u2019s because most of the transportation budget covers expenses mandated by the federal and state governments, such as busing special education and homeless students and transporting other students to charter, parochial, and private schools.\nBusing under the school assignment plan ultimately accounted for just $37 million last year.\nAnd even if the city moved to neighborhood schools, it would still need to shuttle students across neighborhoods because some areas do not have enough schools for all students who live there while other parts have too many schools and not enough kids.\nHow much would actually be saved remains anyone\u2019s guess.\nEssaibi George, who chairs the council\u2019s education"}

Some evictees drowned as they fled police gunfire, while at least one was shot dead.\n\u201cThese ruthless forced evictions are just the most recent examples of a practice that has been going on in Nigeria for over a decade in complete defiance of international law,\u201d said Osai Ojigho, Amnesty International Nigeria\u2019s Country Director.\n\u201cFor the residents of these deprived communities, many of whom rely on their daily fish catch to make a living, the waterfront represents home, work and survival. Forced evictions mean they lose everything \u2013 their livelihoods, their possessions and in some cases their lives.\nAmnesty International spoke to 97 evicted people as part of its research, all of whom told a similar story of being made homeless and losing almost all their possessions.\nBetween November 2016 and April 2017, Lagos state authorities forcibly and violently evicted more than 30,000 residents from the Otodo-Gbame community on the outskirts of Lagos city.\nIn the first eviction, at midnight on November 9, police and unidentified armed men chased out residents with gunfire and teargas, setting homes on fire as bulldozers demolished them.\nPanicked residents tried to run to safety amid the chaos, with eyewitnesses reporting that some drowned in the nearby lagoon as they ran from gunfire.\nNine people are believed to have drowned during the eviction and another 15 remain unaccounted for.\nOf the 4,700 residents who remained in Otodo-Gbame after the eviction, some slept in canoes or out in the open, covering themselves with plastic sheets when it rained.\nFour months later, in March 2017, state security forces backed up by unidentified men armed with machetes, guns and axes forcibly evicted residents who had remained.\nWhen residents protested, they came under attack from police. One man, father of two Daniel Aya, was shot in the neck and killed.\nThe forced evictions were carried out in direct violation of court orders issued on 7 November 2016 and 26 January 2017. In some cases, residents were evicted while they showed police a copy of the court order that was supposed to prevent the government from demolishing their homes.\nMeanwhile, 823 residents of the nearby Ilubirin community were forcibly evicted between 19 March 2016 and 22 April 2017.\nAfter being given just 12 days\u2019 written notice of eviction, Lagos state government officials and dozens of police officers chased residents out of their homes, and demolished all the structures in the community using fire and wood cutting tools.\nEvictees subsequently returned to the area and rebuilt their structures, but these were demolished six months later with just two days\u2019 oral notice and no consultation.\nThe Lagos government\u2019s explanations for these forced evictions have been"}

We need our cellphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not always looking for cheaper ways to make calls. Voice-over-IP services have come a long way in the last few years; Skype has perfected desktop-to-desktop calling, and Google has given us free VoIP domestic calling on Gmail \u2014 talk over WiFi on email from the comfort of your couch. But, the next new frontier has become WiFi and VoIP calling on mobile.\nThere are quite a few players already in this space. Pinger allows you to make calls over WiFi, and my colleague Alexia Tsotsis recently wrote about Talkatone, which uses Google Voice as a channel to allow you to make unlimited calls and send texts over WiFi. But, with each of these, there is always a catch. In Talkatone\u2019s case, to receive incoming calls, you have to upgrade your Google Voice account to get a phone number and tinker with you Google account.\nSo, here we have these intelligent devices we use to make phone calls everyday, aptly called smartphones, but if our phones are so intelligent, why can\u2019t they, say, recognize when WiFi is available and automatically allow us to take advantage of low-cost or free calling using the available WiFi network? Well, now thanks to a service called Bababoo, they can.\nSure, it\u2019s not a terribly appealing name, but it\u2019s certainly an appealing idea. Bababoo is a new telecommunications startup (and app of the same name) that is bringing \u201cintelligent\u201d calling to smartphones. What does that mean? What\u2019s so smaht about it? Bababoo\u2019s iPhone app gives the users the ability to make calling through WiFi, 3G, and the iPhone\u2019s carrier networks, AT&T and Verizon, but you don\u2019t have to change your network, your number, or caller ID. You just open the app, dial, and Bababoo does its thing.\nSo, as an iPhone user, you get to keep your cell phone number, which is a great start. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re using WiFi to make a call, but the person you\u2019re calling doesn\u2019t have WiFi available. In most cases, this means you either can\u2019t make the call, or you\u2019re charged a lot to do so. With Bababoo, as with Pinger and Talkatone, if WiFi is available for both parties, then you get to connect with the person you\u2019re calling over WiFi for free.\nBut, if both callers aren\u2019t on WiFi, Bababoo still connects the call, and it finds the cheapest and most seamless way to do that. You will be charged, but the standard rate in the U.S. is 2 cents per minute, which is comparatively cheap. And here\u2019s the coolest part: Let\u2019s say WiFi is of poor quality, or can\u2019t be found; with most other apps, you\u2019re screwed, but since Bababoo integrates with your carrier as an iPhone user, Bababoo simply switches you over to the 3G network so that you can still make the call.

The email then instructs the user to follow a link to find detailed information about money they may owe to the government.\nA screenshot of an email scam sent to Global News.\nThe link takes the user to a webpage that look almost identical to the CRA\u2019s website and asks them to fill out their personal information, including their credit card number, expiry and security code, as well as their social insurance number.\nHowever, a close look at the URL reveals the user is not on the agency\u2019s official website \u2013 a classic warning sign of a phishing scam.\nA screenshot of the webpage mimicking the CRA\u2019s website.\nThis type of scam targeting taxpayers is not new; so-called CRA scams began popping up in 2013 and have become a popular tool for defrauding people by phone or email, according to the RCMP.\nThe scam phone calls that take place are quite similar to the email scams. Someone claiming to be from the CRA calls and, in a conversation that starts out calmly enough, tells the victim that they have made an error on their tax return or neglected to file it. More concerning, the phone number may seem legitimate to those with caller ID.\nAccording to RCMP, the scammer then asks for financial or banking information to settle the alleged debt owed.\nIn other email scams, fraudsters have sent notice of a tax refund, asking users to send their personal and financial information in order to receive it. Others have requested victims to buy iTunes gift cards in order to pay off their alleged debts.\nBut these scams can be hard to spot. In one instance, a Calgary woman handed over nearly $20,000 before police intervened.\nAdditionally, the CRA will only send you notification emails if you have subscribed to the service and the email will only advise the user to go into their secure tax account to see relevant information.\nBut, just in case, there are a few surefire ways to recognize a phishing scam email from a mile away.\nFirst \u2013 never be fooled by official names or logos. One of the most common ways that phishing scams will try to fool you is by using official company logos or insignias. In some cases, the email address or web address may look close to the company\u2019s name, but is slightly altered or off by a letter.\nTake, for example, the email below. Though the sender\u2019s name clearly states \u201cCanada Revenue Agency\u201d the email address is not a government email (which usually ends in \u201cgc.ca\u201d).\nThis tip is especially important: Never click on a link included in a suspicious email \u2013 and, if you do, never enter any personal information on the webpage.\nBut, if you are working on a computer, you can hover your mouse over the link \u2013 without clicking on it \u2013 and a small yellow box will appear showing the actual web address the link will take you to."}

Maybe they are enticed by the huge revenue rewards that Colorado reaps from taxing recreational marijuana? You may know Kansans who visit Colorado just for weed, happily pumping money into their economy and state tax coffers. Or maybe marijuana is just not an unthinkable taboo to most Kansans?\nOur lawmakers, though, are not in sync. When the Legislature last debated medical marijuana, Rep. John Wheeler opined that it \u201ccould open the door to absolute chaos on the streets of Kansas,\u201d notwithstanding that his Garden City district is near Colorado and probably flourishing with weed already. And then there is Rep. Steve Alford, who publicly implied that black people and their supposed \u201ccharacter makeup\u201d and \u201cgenetics\u201d are why marijuana is illegal (he later apologized).\nOf course, the other extreme on marijuana \u2014 largely absent in Topeka \u2014 is also problematic. Much like alcohol or tobacco, marijuana has risks that should not be ignored and that merit regulation, even if recreational marijuana is legal.\nNow I respect that some people are uncomfortable with legalized marijuana in any form. But the age gap in opinions on marijuana is huge. Lawmakers today may not legalize recreational weed, but their children or grandchildren will. And they will wonder why today\u2019s politicians waited so long to reap the financial benefits.\nMeanwhile, Kansas is being left behind, especially on medical marijuana. That has huge implications for the many Kansans with conditions like chronic pain or seizures who might benefit from it. And bluntly, Kansas is increasingly surrounded by states with legalized weed in some form. No system is foolproof, and marijuana has been and will continue to make its way into Kansas. Is policing that flow where Kansans want their tax dollars spent, especially given how the majority of them feel about marijuana?\nKansas deserves an informed and smart debate about marijuana. One with less hyperbole and fewer character attacks. But also one that recognizes the public opinion and policy realities around marijuana.

Huseynov had been nearing the end of a two-year prison sentence on charges that he defamed two police officers whom he accused of torturing him, but then the prison authorities accused him of attacking a prison officer, charges that his lawyer said could add up to seven years to his term.

The line ran approximately nine miles from City Hall north to Grand Central Station, then west to Times Square and up the West Side to 145th Street.\nThe first underground railway system, the Metropolitan Railway, opened in London in 1863. The trains ran on steam, which caused problems in the tunnels, but the system proved popular. A competing London metro system introduced electric trains in 1890, which made underground transit more practical.\nThough the first subway in the United States opened in 1897 in Boston, New York eventually became the American city most associated with underground transportation.

For several minutes, Meyers lobbed one joke after another at Trump\u2019s expense, even wedging in a prescient imitation of Trump hosting a White House news conference.\nVideo from the dinner would later show Trump seemingly frozen in the audience, lips pursed, staring straight ahead with his face set into something between a squint and a hard scowl, as Meyers continued.\nAfter Trump announced his candidacy, several publications seized upon the 2011 dinner as the moment in which his political ambitions crystallized.\nThe National Review, in a similar search for what might have motivated Trump to run, published a piece titled \u201cHow the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner Gave Us the Trump Campaign.\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s Adam Gopnik wrote in September 2015 that he had been seated a few tables away from Trump in 2011.\n\u201cOn that night, Trump\u2019s own sense of public humiliation became so overwhelming that he decided, perhaps at first unconsciously, that he would, somehow, get his own back \u2014 perhaps even pursue the presidency after all, no matter how nihilistically or absurdly, and redeem himself,\u201d Gopnik wrote.\nThat said, The Post\u2019s Roxanne Roberts has systematically dismantled the theory that Trump was spurred to run specifically because of the 2011 correspondents\u2019 dinner, disastrous as it may have been for him. For one, his presidential ambitions apparently started decades earlier.\n\u201cThis narrative flies in the face of actual history: Trump mentioned running for president as far back as the 1980s, so the notion that this dinner was the single catalyst for this presidential campaign is absurd,\u201d she wrote in April 2016.\nThat did not stop many pundits from pointing to the 2011 dinner as the tipping point for Trump\u2019s political ambitions \u2014 including Meyers himself. Last year, the late-night comedian made an appearance on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show,\u201d where the two tussled, half-jokingly, about who should take the \u201ccredit\u201d for sp"}

But, if you're voting by mail, sending in a ballot isn't enough to guarantee your vote will be counted.\nElection lawyers offer this warning: People's signatures change over time. And your county election official is supposed to check the signature on your mail ballot with the signature on your registration card. If you signed a voter registration card years, or even decades ago, you run the risk that the signatures no longer match. In that case, your vote won't be counted. And you won't be notified.\nSo now is the time -- before the May 24 deadline to register to vote in the June 8 statewide primary -- to drop by your county election office.

It's also distributed elsewhere, including most recently through Microsoft's Xbox Live service.\nSince launch, VEVO has gone on to become the most popular music related Web site, and number three video site (behind YouTube and Facebook) with almost 57 million monthly unique viewers who spend an average of more than an hour at the site.\nIt has also paid out more than $100 million in royalties to the artists and other content owners who distribute videos through the site.\nWe caught up with VEVO CEO Rio Caraeff to talk about the future of the company, and music video online.\nVEVO is on track to be profitable in the first half of next year, but probably won't be spun off as an independent public company.\nBetween 70% and 75% of VEVO's volume comes through YouTube.\nMore long-form content and original programming. \"You can't go to a fashion show without music. You can't go to a restaurant without music. You can't go to a sporting event without music. There's a rich mine of narrative and stories that you can tell within there.

When it comes to the economy, $85 billion is a good candidate. That's the amount the Federal Reserve has been pumping into the financial system each month trying to stimulate growth and bring down unemployment. On Tuesday, Fed policymakers begin a two-day meeting at which they'll decide whether to dial back that stimulus.\nNPR presents the numbers that crystallize an idea or trend that was important in 2013.\nOn Tuesday, Federal Reserve policymakers begin a two-day meeting where many analysts expect they will announce a reduction in the central bank's $85 billion monthly stimulus.\nMany economists and investors think there's a good chance that at the end of their two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, Federal Reserve policymakers will announce that they'll begin reducing their $85 billion monthly stimulus, their third round of quantitative easing, or QE3.\nThe analysts think recent economic data, like a drop in the unemployment rate to 7 percent and a budget deal in Washington, have brightened the outlook for the economy enough that the Fed can pull back.\nBut there's another troubling number that could make Fed policymakers stand pat, says University of Chicago professor and former Fed governor Randy Kroszner. That number is the inflation rate.\n\"Inflation being far below where the Fed wants it to be is a major reason why they may hesitate,\" Kroszner says.\nPrinceton economist Alan Blinder points out that, strangely, during a period when the Fed has pumped trillions into the financial system, inflation has drifted lower.\n\"Inflation has in fact fallen on average over the last five years,\" Blinder says.\nThe most recent measurement shows that core inflation in a basket of consumer goods through the 12 months ending in October was running at just 1.7 percent. That's below the Fed's target of 2.0 percent, and it's been drifting downward this year.\nBlinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed, says this falling inflation is an extraordinary development given the trillions the Fed has pumped into the financial system. Economics textbooks say that's a recipe for inflation.\nSo what happened to that $85 billion a month \u2014 $1 trillion total \u2014 that the Fed has pumped into the financial system over the past year?\n\"It all got bottled up in the banks, and essentially none of it ... got lent out,\" Blinder says.\nHe says the banks are the key to making quantitative easing work. It would work by the Fed announcing it wants to buy $85 billion each month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Blinder says banks would then line up to sell them, and the Fed pays the banks by putting money in their reserve accounts at the Federal Reserve.\n\"You can think of these as the deposits that banks hold at the Federal Reserve, which is a bank for them,\" he says.\nBut unless the banks lend those deposits, or invest them, they don't get into the economy, they don't enter the money supply, and they don't contribute to inflation. And if banks aren't lending, there's no boost to the economy, either, which is, after all, the Fed's main goal.\n\"This is the $64 trillion question \u2014 the deep, deep mystery to me,\" Blinder says. \"In bits and pieces, we understand"}

They had enlisted into a decidedly low-tech effort.\nBesides plastic booms and giant tampons, a plan has been floated -- wrong word perhaps -- to dredge up some barrier islands just off the coast as a kind of earthen fortification against the big slick. And there were reports this week that chicken feathers and horse hair and alpaca wool and human hair were collected and woven into oil-absorbing fabrics, a great hairy effort to save the Gulf coast. Petco promised to send a ton of pet hair daily to help soak up spewing oil.\nBut the juxtaposition of fur ball technology against the nearly (but not quite) miraculous engineering that led to this catastrophe was nearly jarring. The Deepwater Horizon, a $300 million vessel floating unmoored 50 miles south of the Louisiana coast, kept in place by computers and satellite positioning, was able to drill miles down into a seabed 5,000 feet below the surface with stunning precision.\nBut when so many fail-safe gizmos malfunctioned and the oil vomited from the depths and threatened Gulf Coast habitats and (now it seems) Florida beaches and reefs, the oil industry revealed a massive technology gap. The engineering employed to get us out of this mess seemed decades behind the engineering that gave us this disaster."}

It has the potential to make an animated film that\u2019s not just highly entertaining but is also unlike any other computer animated film yet made, yet it keeps racing away from its own best material to try and be Pixar lite. Obviously, wanting to be like Pixar isn\u2019t a bad thing, and it\u2019s what keeps Blue Sky\u2019s product generally watchable, as opposed to the hit-and-miss chaos that is the output of Dreamworks Animation. But at the same time, the sentiment in Blue Sky\u2019s films\u2014the very first Ice Age largely excepted\u2014feels forced in a way it rarely does in Pixar\u2019s output. The company\u2019s films come alive when they engage in Looney Tunes-style chaos, a tone that no other computer animation studio does quite so well, and it\u2019s always disappointing to watch, say, a scene where Scrat gets caught up in something out of a Daffy Duck cartoon, then be deposited back into a bunch of learning and growing and family togetherness.\nThus it\u2019s kind of terrifying to see Blue Sky take on a Christmas special. Christmas specials, of course, are all about learning and growing and family togetherness. You can bet that if someone is even the slightest bit skeptical about the magic of Christmas\u2014as someone is here\u2014they\u2019ll be convinced of the specialness of the night by the end. And you can bet that any wacky slapstick\u2014like the usual amusing antics of Scrat trying to get that acorn\u2014will be shoved aside by a story that seems to be mostly going through the motions. At the same time, Blue Sky has created a batch of characters who are fun to hang out with, so watching this half-hour special isn\u2019t painful or anything. But there\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s even as distinctive as, say, Shrek The Halls, to say nothing of ABC\u2019s Prep & Landing, the gold standard of recent Christmas specials.\nThe plot here is fairly simple. For whatever reason, the characters of the Ice Age franchise celebrate Christmas, but their traditions are far from the ones we know and recognize. Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano, as always) enjoys hauling out the family Christmas rock every year, for instance, and he scoffs when Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) proposes decorating a tree instead. When Sid causes a decorations disaster that angers Manny, however, Manny makes up the idea of a \u201cnaughty list,\u201d something that ensures that Santa\u2014who\u2019s someone everybody is pretty sure exists, though no one\u2019s seen him\u2014will pass you by and make sure that Christmas doesn\u2019t come for you this year. (The story of how Christmas works for these characters is full of logical inconsistencies that are best not to think about too hard, not least of which is how they celebrate the holiday in the first place.) Horrified by the idea of being on the naughty list, Sid sets out with Peaches (Ciara Bravo), Manny\u2019s daughter, and his other friends for the North Pole, in order to convince Santa to remove him from the list.\nThe actors give this their all, for the most part. Even Denis Leary, as Diego the Sabretooth Tiger (a character that\u2019s largely been relegated to the sidelines as the franchise has gone on for no particular reason), seems to be trying to throw himself into"}

You should implement ''mean'' pooling (i.e., averaging over feature responses) for this part.\nFirst, we want to compute \u03c3(Wx(r,c) + b) for all valid (r,c) (valid meaning that the entire 8x8 patch is contained within the image; as opposed to a full convolution which allows the patch to extend outside the image, with the area outside the image assumed to be 0) , where W and b are the learned weights and biases from the input layer to the hidden layer, and x(r,c) is the 8x8 patch with the upper left corner at (r,c). To accomplish this, one naive method is to loop over all such patches and compute \u03c3(Wx(r,c) + b) for each of them; while this is fine in theory, it can very slow. Hence, we usually use Matlab's built in convolution functions which are well optimized.\nObserve that the convolution above can be broken down into the following three small steps. First, compute Wx(r,c) for all (r,c). Next, add b to all the computed values. Finally, apply the sigmoid function to the resultant values. This doesn't seem to buy you anything, since the first step still requires a loop. However, you can replace the loop in the first step with one of MATLAB's optimized convolution functions, conv2, speeding up the process significantly.\nHowever, there are two important points to note in using conv2.\nTo each of convolvedFeatures, you should then add b, the corresponding bias for the featureNum-th feature. If you had not done any preprocessing of the patches, you could then apply the sigmoid function to obtain the convolved features. However, because you preprocessed the patches before learning features on them, you must also apply the same preprocessing steps to the convolved patches to get the correct feature activations.\nImplement pooling in the function cnnPool in cnnPool.m. You should implement mean pooling (i.e., averaging over feature responses) for this part.\nNow that you have a trained softmax classifier, you can see how well it performs on the test set. These pooled features for the test set will be run through the softmax classifier, and the accuracy of the predictions will be computed. You should expect to get an accuracy of around 80%."}

In the summer, a crew removed materials from the building.\nThe brick depot has a cool mid-century sign reading \"Fort Benton,\" which the historical society hopes to secure for the museum.\n\"We're going to walk through this month and see if there's anything else they want to save,\" Lane said.\nThe railroad has out a request for proposals for demolition but expects winter will delay any such efforts.\n\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t had anyone go out there and do the proposal yet,\u201d he said.\nFort Benton has had three railroad depots in its history, according to Art Jacobsen, local railroad history buff.\nThe first depot at the Benton stop was a small shack on the bench north of town along the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway, the precursor to the Great Northern Railway.\nIt stretched through Fort Benton to Great Falls in the fall of 1887. Hints of that old railroad grade are still visible in a nearby coulee.\nThe second depot was a wood-frame building constructed when the Great Northern Railroad realigned the secondary main line to its present location in 1901. The depot cost $952 to build, and the railroad furnished the materials.\nThat's the depot local artist Brian Morger painted in \"Shep,\" which depicts the loyal dog on his long vigil.\nShep first appeared in Fort Benton in 1936 when his owner, an area sheepherder whose name remains unknown, was brought to town for medical treatment. When the sheepherder died, his body was sent on a passenger train to his family in the East.\nFor the next 51/2 years, Shep lived at the Fort Benton train station, waiting for his master\u2019s return. In 1942, he was killed by a train.\nThe third depot in Fort Benton was a rebuilt, modernized version of the wooden depot, built in 1950.\nPassenger service ended when the Budd car stopped running in April 1971. The railroad closed the agency there 14 years later when the line between Fort Benton and Big Sandy was abandoned because of a \"slip out\" along the bluff above the Missouri River's left bank, aggravated by an irrigation system installed on the bench above town in 1976, Jacobsen found.\nAnd so Fort Benton's depot became a BNSF office and storage site until the line into Fort Benton was abandoned in 2003. It was vacant and for sale, crumbling more every year, until demolition started a few months ago with the roof coming off.\nLane reminded people not to trespass onto the railroad property or into the depot for safety's sake."}

The study of the past masters of political philosophy was dutifully prolonged in universities, but without much hope of a new vision that would be likely to stir the interest of a wider public. The dust jacket says that A Theory of Justice has been translated into every major European language as well as into Chinese, Japanese, and Korean: a wider public indeed.\nAfter Rawls followed not only a rush of books and articles in learned journals commenting on his work but also at least two well-argued parallel theories, each conveying a distinctive vision of liberalism: by Ronald Dworkin in Taking Rights Seriously and by Michael Walzer in Spheres of Justice. All three writers have been trying to formulate, as clearly as they can, the moral foundations of liberalism, as this slippery term is understood in political arguments within the US.\nIt is important, I think, to acknowledge that Rawls\u2019s theories and arguments have to be understood, in the first place, as having their origin in the special setting of American history and of the American Constitution. Obviously liberalism is a political creed, with a set of political attitudes, which has flourished in Europe since Napoleon and which there has been supported by the arguments of Kant, Constant, Humboldt, Mill, and Sidgwick, among others. But American liberalism calls upon specific historical memories of the War of Independence, the debates on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Emancipation, all relatively recent events that have no equivalents in Europe. For this reason the search in the US for the justification of coercive government, and for the grounds of legitimacy, has employed a distinctive moral vocabulary which places a greater stress upon essential or primary human rights than has been usual in European thought about politics. Reading Rawls one is impressed by his distinctively American account of republican virtue, and of the political conception of persons as free and equal participants in a democracy.\nRawls\u2019s great achievement in international thought was to restore the notion of justice to its proper place at the center of arguments about politics, the place that it had occupied at the very beginning of theorizing in Plato\u2019s Republic. Justice is a necessary virtue of individuals both in their day-to-day conduct and in their personal relations, and it is the principal virtue of institutions and the social order. Plato described justice in the city state, social justice, as both reflecting and promoting the wisdom and moral soundness of those individual citizens who are themselves just, and Rawls\u2019s account is in this tradition."}

Image source: Polaris Industries.\nWe knew when Polaris Industries (NYSE:PII) bought Brammo in January that it planned to jump-start the arms race in electric motorcycles, and the introduction of the new Victory Empulse TT means it made good on that promise.\nAlthough rival Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) says it would rather get it right than be first -- last year it unveiled the prototype Project LiveWire e-bike, but a production version won't be ready till at least 2020 -- it's likely still a bit jealous of its competitor, which is proving much more game at manufacturing and marketing motorcycles than was previously believed possible.\nEven so, bragging rights in the e-bike market may not amount to all that much.\nAccording to market analysts at Navigant Research, \"worldwide sales of electric motorcycles and scooters are expected to grow from 5.3 million annually in 2015 to nearly 6 million by 2024.\" Most of the sales, though, will be in China, which accounts for 98% of the market, and the vast bulk of two-wheeled electric vehicle demand is actually for scooters, not motorcycles.\nCurrently, one of the world's leading e-bike manufacturers is Zero Motorcycles, and while it enjoyed record sales in 2014 with even greater growth expected this year, it's only anticipating some 2,400 bikes will be sold, or about the number of big bikes Harley sells in two days.\nIt's true that the entrance of a traditional bike manufacturer like Polaris (and eventually Harley, Yamaha, and Honda) could change that dynamic and accelerate interest (and sales) in the niche, but we're not talking about game-changing results from any of the manufacturers.\nThe introduction of a street-legal e-bike by a major manufacturer may be just the spark the industry needs to emerge from niche to substantive market. Image source: Polaris Industries.\nFor example, even though Harley-Davidson is confronting declining bike sales and shipments as its core customers shy away from making big expenditures on expensive discretionary items, it still sold more than 89,000 motorcycles in the second quarter. Even if it had a production LiveWire ready to go, the total number it would sell would be minuscule.\nSimilarly, Polaris' motorcycle division accounted for just 14% of its total quarterly revenues. It's making more money selling parts, clothes, and accessories than it does motorcycles. Electric bikes may be an interesting niche business, but right now, it's little more than that.\nBut let's also not discount the value of Polaris being first to market. First, it is \"getting it right.\" Whereas the demo LiveWire has only a 50-mile range on a battery charge (with greater distances promised when it goes into production), the Empulse TT can hold a charge that can take you almost twice as far, and it shouldn't be long"}

They tend to be offered in the midst of a major company crisis. In 2015, scandal-hit car producer Volkswagen offered amnesty to staff in an attempt to get a hold on its emissions-cheating problem.\nChief executive Herbert Diess wrote to staff promising they would not be fired or face claims of damages. He, however, added that he could not protect staff from criminal prosecution.\nIn 2013, Canadian construction firm SNC Lavalin also extended amnesty to employees to \"report potential corruption and anti-competition matters in which they may have been directly and indirectly involved\". SNC Lavalin, which was at the time under fraud investigation by the authorities, said the policy was \"to assist the company's efforts to fully gather and assess the facts associated with ongoing corporate ethics matters and to address and mitigate known risks in this area\".\nHaving an amnesty can be resource-efficient, because some will invariably step forward. This can provide vital leads to companies trying to get to the bottom of a problem.\nTransport operator SMRT had that goal in mind when it offered its staff an amnesty period to come clean about any breaches they may have committed. The move came after it found some staff may have falsified maintenance records for the pump system in Bishan. The lack of maintenance had caused the flooding of an MRT tunnel last month.\nSMRT group chief executive Desmond Kuek said the offer - which ended on Friday - was made to quickly establish the extent of improper practices, and allow staff to \"volunteer information in open reporting as a mitigation against further disciplinary action\".\nASSOCIATE PROFESSOR MAK YUEN TEEN from the National University of Singapore Business School, on SMRT's offer.\nSome staff from SMRT's Building and Facilities Department have taken up the offer and admitted to breaches, Insight understands. Yesterday, Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao also reported that SMRT planned to sack six staff over the flooding incident. When contacted, SMRT declined to comment.\nAssociate Professor Mak Yuen Teen from the National University of Singapore Business School reckons SMRT decided to offer amnesty as it did not know the extent of the problem, and recognised it may not be able to detect all breaches through audits and checks. He adds that SMRT now has to ensure those staff who came forward are not blacklisted or punished. \"It's important that they deliver on their promise of amnesty, otherwise the trust will be broken,\" he says.\nSingapore Human Resources Institute President Erman Tan views the move to offer amnesty as a positive step towards building an open culture within the company.

Revenue rose to $9.38 billion from $9.33 billion, also ahead of the FactSet estimate of $9.11 billion. Sales were driven by televisions, computing and tablets, as well as gaming and appliances, Chief Executive Hubert Joly said in a statement. The company is expecting fourth-quarter revenue and same-store sales to be flat, but for adjusted per-share earnings to rise by about 50 basis points.

In announcing the scrapped meeting, the company conceded that it \u201cdoes not expect to have the requisite stockholder votes\u201d to approve a reverse stock split, which would have been set at a range between 1-for-2 shares and 1-for-500 shares.\nReverse splits are generally not signs of fiscal health. Companies use them to boost share prices by dramatically limiting the number of outstanding shares, thereby artificially inflating the price. Nasdaq is permitted to delist companies whose shares trade below $1 for a sustained period of time.\nHelios shareholders approved a 1-to-250 reverse split last summer, with a similar aim of avoiding the sub-$1 danger zone. Shares spent a couple of days on the upswing, briefly reaching about $22.50 before plummeting back to earth. In addition to the New York probe and legal claims that it misled investors, the company faced public backlash during the peak summer moviegoing season, when it abruptly yanked popular titles like Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout. Initially blaming a tech glitch, the company has also indicated it could not afford to keep burning cash by paying tens of millions a month for bulk ticket orders while keeping subscription prices at $10 a month.\nIn its filing today, Helios marked December 18 as a key date. If it does not regain compliance (mainly via a $1 share price) by then, it could be granted a second 180-day period to get back on the beam. The filing notes that the Nasdaq could always decline the company\u2019s request for more time. A delisting would follow, which would rob the company of a vital source of equity and legitimacy. Helios has announced its intent to spin off MoviePass, whose businesses also include film finance and production, into a separately managed company.\nWith exhibitors now ramping up their own subscription offerings \u2014 AMC Stubs A-List just announced it has reached 500,000 members about eight months ahead of schedule \u2014 the market is much more competitive. MoviePass has further complicated its situation by changing its model multiple times in 2018, settling on allowing subscribers three movies a month but also reserving the right to pull hot titles off its app.\nThe SEC filing does not note any of these moves specifically, but it ends on a note of regret. \u201cThe Board apologizes for any inconvenience this may have caused its stockholders,\u201d it said."}
{"idx": "4890", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) makes dramatic changes in the country\u2019s health care system, especially in Medicare, that will seriously affect American seniors. Indeed, much of the health law\u2019s new spending is financed by spending reductions in the Medicare program.\nObamacare mandates $716 billion in Medicare payment reductions from 2013 to 2022. However, contrary to the way they are often portrayed, these cuts are not aimed at specific instances of waste, fraud, and abuse. Instead, they are across-the-board changes in Medicare payment formulas for a variety of Medicare providers, including hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and hospice agencies.\nDespite the constant political rhetoric that Medicare payment reductions affect only providers and not beneficiaries, funding cuts for Medicare services will directly affect those who depend on those services. If Obamacare\u2019s major reductions are implemented by Congress over the coming decade, seniors\u2019 ability to access Medicare services will surely diminish. In fact, the Medicare Trustees project that the lower Medicare payment rates would cause 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies to become unprofitable by 2019, and this percentage would reach roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050.\nMedicare\u2019s payments for health services would fall increasingly below providers\u2019 costs. Providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and would have to withdraw from serving Medicare beneficiaries or (if total facility margins remained positive) shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers.\nIn addition to the provider payment reductions, Obamacare significantly reduces payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans by an estimated $156 billion from 2013 to 2022. About 27 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in MA plans, a system of regulated and private plans competing against each other as an alternative to traditional Medicare. MA plans are attractive to beneficiaries because they offer more generous and comprehensive coverage than traditional Medicare by capping out-of-pocket costs and offering drug coverage.\nWhen Obamacare was enacted in 2010, the Medicare Actuary projected that the impact of Obamacare\u2019s cuts would be significant: \u201cWe estimate that in 2017, when the MA provisions will be fully phased in, enrollment in MA plans will be lower by about 50 percent (from its projected level of 14.8 million under the prior law to 7.4 million under the new law).\u201d This means that these enrollees would have to enroll in the less generous traditional Medicare program, causing them to lose their current health plan and likely face increased out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently updated its MA enrollment estimates, projecting a significant increase in seniors who will be enrolled in MA plans by 2023. Thus, conflicting enrollment projections leave Medicare Advantage with an uncertain future. It is not yet known how MA plans will react to Obamacare\u2019s significant reductions or how beneficiaries will respond to any changes made by MA plans.\nObamacare gives new powers to make additional cuts in Medicare through the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB is comprised of 15 unelected bureaucrats charged with meeting a newly created Medicare spending target. If spending exceeds the"}

Presumably being faithful to the spirit of the video game franchise means that at some point our protagonist will be chased by the police.\nWhile Aaron Paul joining the film is undeniably great news, the rest of the confirmed crew for this project leaves us a bit less excited. Director Scott Waugh has very little experience with actual films, and his only real big screen directorial effort to date has been Act Of Valor, that pseudo-fictional action flick that was sold entirely on the fact that it starred real Navy SEALs. Prior to that film, all of Waugh\u2019s notable work has been as a part of a stunt crew. Admittedly, he did work on car films during this time, but those movies aren\u2019t exactly hallmarks of the genre. Some of you may have seen the relatively recent Italian Job remake, but how many of you saw Torque or Biker Boyz?\nThe script, in turn, was written by brothers John and George Gatins. For the most part, both Gatins brothers are producers, though John wrote the script for 2011\u2019s Real Steel. Whether that gives you more hope for this video game adaptation hinges entirely on how much you enjoyed what was effectively a film adaptation of Rock \u2018Em Sock \u2018Em Robots.\nStill neither of the Gatins has created anything truly objectionable, so they do little to temper our excitement for Aaron Paul leading this movie. The announcement claims that while this film won\u2019t be based on any particular Need For Speed game, it will be based on the franchise as a whole, which is a perfect set up to cast Paul as a small time crook who gets in over his head in a world of high-stakes crime. Replace Breaking Bad\u2019s blue meth with exotic cars, and Paul can basically play his Jesse Pinkman character in this movie as well. Barring any massive directorial missteps or studio interference, that might just be all you need for a quality video game movie."}

Indeed, though the film is 2 hours and 14 minutes long, by the end I was wishing for more.

It was a guide book specifically for African Americans in the 1950s and the 1960s.\nTrue stories are often the very best stories, and this is one them.

It will take some sleuthing.\nThe Federal Communications Commissions proposed repeal of the current \u201cOpen Internet\u201d regulations would free Internet service providers to do all the things the FCC banned in 2015. Your ISP could block or slow any legal site, app or service or charge it for priority handling of its data\u2014but it would still have to disclose that conduct.\nThe idea behind that transparency mandate is to keep Internet providers subject to two forms of discipline.\nAt a minimum, broadband customers could check to see if a wired or wireless provider would hinder a site they like. The draft of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s proposed order, posted Wednesday, suggests that public pressure alone would push an ISP to back down from any such interference, citing AT&T\u2019s quick 2012 retreat from blocking Apple\u2019s FaceTime app.\nFurther, an ISP that either interfered with a site in undocumented ways or tried to suppress a competitor to one of its own services would risk an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC can investigate \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d conduct and seek civil penalties for it.\nMajor Internet providers such as Comcast have repeated earlier pledges not to block or throttle content, although statements like Comcast\u2019s vow not to \"discriminate against lawful content\u201d leave rhetorical space for charging more for an Internet fast lane.\nISPs could certainly exempt their own video services from their own data caps\u2014but the FCC already allows that.\nThat leaves consumers as the first line of defense.\nAnd the plan by the man President Trump picked last winter to head the FCC also pulls back from current net-neutrality protections in two ways.\nFirst, it doesn\u2019t require disclosure of everything covered by the 2015 rules, including addressing network-to-network \u201cinterconnection\u201d arrangements that govern how large volumes of data get shipped between the likes of Netflix and ISPs.\nRemember when Netflix became unwatchable for months over such providers as Comcast and Verizon? ISPs would not have to document the traffic deals that can make a high-traffic site responsive or not, and which today\u2019s rules let the FCC regulate under an open-ended \u201cgeneral conduct\u201d provision.\nSecond, an Internet provider wouldn\u2019t have to post its disclosure statement in a particular place or in a particular format. The proposed order gives an ISP a choice: It can publish that document \u201con a publicly available, easily accessible website\u201d\u2014that\u2019s supposed to be the one at where you\u2019d actually sign up for service\u2014or it can provide that information to the FCC, at which point it will be up to broadband shoppers to remember to check there.\nNeither possibility specifies a consistent listing of a provider\u2019s policies along the lines of the nutrition label-style disclosures the FCC proposed last year. As you may have noticed the last time you attempted to digest a terms-of-service agreement from a social network, not every company is equally straightforward in explaining its policies.\nBut even maximum clarity from an Internet provider about its handling of individual sites won\u2019t help you much if you can\u2019t switch from that company to a competitor. The FCC\u2019s own stats, based on data provided by ISPs, suggest your choices dwindle as your desired download speeds increase.\nAs of June 30, "}

{"idx": "4916", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In a culture in which speaking about death and dying has long been taboo, and with a health care system that does not foster such conversations, it should come as no surprise that only about 30 percent of Americans have advance directives for health care on file. Even then, an advance directive is just a paper form, and often one that is not accessible at the point of care.\nMore meaningful planning occurs when an individual has a health-care agent - a person with the legal authority to make health-care decisions on another's behalf. An effective person serving in this role must not only know and understand another's wishes for care but also be willing and able to honor them.\nThe consequences of forgoing this kind of planning are severe. The default in American medicine is \"to do everything,\" which lends itself to aggressive care and intensive-care unit stays that can be painful for patients and their loved ones and harmful for the health-care system as a whole.\nIn the words of a friend who is a resident, \"There is nothing worse about my job than making life-or-death decisions in the ICU. It isn't the place to explore these questions for the first time, and there is never a right answer.\" Pull the plug (i.e., stop life-prolonging treatments) and you are giving up on Mom. Keep treating aggressively, and you are torturing her, often to no avail.\nDespite unfounded talk of so-called death panels, there's evidence that shows talking about death and dying may not be as off-limits as we think. A 2012 survey by the California Healthcare Foundation found that 79 percent of patients who responded want to talk about their wishes for end-of-life care with their doctors. This is especially encouraging, given that structured systems to support advance-care planning conversations are growing at an increasing rate.\nFor instance, in La Crosse, Wis., which has been called America's best place to die because the majority of the population receives care in accordance with their values and wishes, Gundersen Health System pioneered a program called Respecting Choices. This is a systematic approach to advance-care planning built around detailed conversations led by trained facilitators that include patients and their chosen health-care agents. These conversations result in a mutual understanding between patient and agent of the former's wishes for care, along with clear and accessible documentation of those wishes. The approach is being adopted with great success by much larger health-care systems across the country.\nIn addition to health-care systems trying to institutionalize comprehensive advance-care planning, there has also been an increase in self-help tools that guide individuals and their families in talks about the end-of-life process. A great example is the Conversation Project (www.theconversationproject.org), which is taking part in a campaign called \"Let's have dinner and talk about death.\" This project encourages and assists families to \"transform the seemingly difficult conversation about death into an intimate shared experience.\"\nEven outside of formal programs, everyone can talk with their families and friends (ideally including a designated health-care agent) about their values and beliefs, and how these might translate into health-care preferences in scenarios that we prefer not to think about. These conversations become even more important for individuals who have chronic diseases and are likely to experience a functional decline.\n\u2022 Brad Stulberg is a population health consultant at a large health-care system, where his work includes advance-care planning.

The weather was non-uniform, the wigs did not need separate billing and the clothes \u2013 while still Edwardianly gorgeous \u2013 looked like they might survive more than one day\u2019s shooting of the story of the gradual entwining of the Wilcox, Schlegel and Bast families intact.\nIn the first episode we have the fleeting engagement of Helen Schlegel (wonderfully played by Philippa Coulthard, whose youthful enthusiasm already contains hints of the perilous idealism to come) to a Wilcox son \u2013 which is better delineated here than in the film as an outcropping of her infatuation with the whole family \u2013 its awkward aftermath and the growing friendship between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs Wilcox. Again, this is developed at greater length than in the film, which will surely make coming events more credible, aided by the fact that the characters here are played, respectively, by Hayley Atwell and Julia Ormond, with all of those actors\u2019 customary intelligence and commitment. Helen has her first intimation of the ultimate futility of life during Beethoven\u2019s 5th \u2013 goblins!

The dip flooded every rainy season and made the road impassable until it was built up, says Paul Metcalf, a consultant who works for the Barczewski family and its entities. \u201cWhen he placed the fill there it was to get from one part of his property to another,\u201d Metcalf says.\nLuxury homes now cover most of Carmel Valley, which used to be home to several large scale nurseries.\nThis is California, and this is a California story. So when the city and the Coastal Commission looked at the one-acre of high quality wetlands, they ordered Barczewskis to drain the accidental pond and then create bigger replacement wetlands elsewhere.\nAfter what appears to be 15 years of not getting the work done, the Barczewskis found a new friend to help fund the long-delayed corrective action.\nThey\u2019re selling some of their land that\u2019s adjacent to the mitigation wetland to the San Diego Association of Governments, which also has to create and maintain a wetlands to make up for environmental effects of the regional transportation agency\u2019s Rose Creek Bikeway.\nNeither Robert Barczewski, the 82-year-old who bought the 260-acre parcel before 1980 and ran Rancho Del Sol Nurseries, nor his son Chris Barczewski responded to multiple phone messages and emails with questions regarding this matter.\nBut riches of documents from the State Regional Water Quality Control Board, the California Coastal Commission, the city\u2019s Development Services and its Planning Commission, the community planning group; plus Superior and Appellate Court records tell a convoluted story about arguing, planning, suing, and enforcing \u2014 and doing very little for a long time.\nApparently, at some point in the fight over the missing money, Sandra Barczewski asked her title company, which was suing her, to pay for her legal defense against itself as required by the title insurance documents.\nThe Barczewski suit was dismissed in the state court. A later appeal failed, but the justices drafted the unusually detailed statement of the case that made their perspective public and almost unchallengeable.\nIn 1984, some of the land was in use as a nursery. Back then, Carmel Valley was full of nurseries including the Evergreen Nurseries mothership, which now may be the last wholesale plant nursery in the upscale neighborhood of million-dollar homes that lie mostly north of State Route 56.\nBig home developers \u2014 Lennar, Pardee, and Barratt American among them \u2014 were interested in building in the valley and the Barczewskis sold some land and worked with some developers.\nIn 1987, the coastal commission gave the nod to create 37 lots \u2014 including the luxe, gated Caminito Mendiola segment\u2019s 12 houses \u2014 and to keep part of the nursery operating downhill from the exclusive street.\n\u201cAgricultural use on the lots was generally divided into two areas: the eastern portions of the lot(s) were developed with greenhouse and storage structures.

Many suburbs in the county, however, have opted out of the wage increase. Should Illinois raise its minimum wage from $8.25 an hour?\nANSWER: No. Increasing minimum wage destroys jobs. Best way to increases workers wages is to reduce taxes and allow small businesses to thrive. Example is after the recent federal tax decrease many workers received wage increases and bonuses.

It is not that hard to do. I have done it. I would work toward a 1 % of a home\u2019s value property tax cap, which is the average in the US. In Illinois some home owners are paying more in property taxes than their mortgage payments. Those retired can\u2019t afford to stay in the home they rose their families in. It\u2019s not right.\nWith the rate people are fleeing Illinois we will have a difficult time supporting core services and pension obligations.

{"idx": "4927", "prompt": "Continue the following text: There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.\nThen there was what could be called Williams's British side, although I suspect British people would be somewhat flummoxed by that description. \"His humour is already reminiscent of the great British comedians,\" the MC at the Improv in LA crowed in 1977, introducing Williams for one of his earliest televised standup performances. What the MC meant, of course, was that Williams's comedy was weird. It was also sharp and a little scary. It was manic, in other words, and only someone extremely talented and very smart could pull it off without it all falling to pieces, and Williams was both of those things to the day he died. When he appeared as a guest on The Daily Show last year, he was his usual free-wheeling, wide-ranging self, slipping in and out of voices while also talking candidly about rehab. His voice sounded a little heavier, and there was a weary \"All right, all right, let's give them what they want\" look in his eyes, which at the time I put down to age and fatigue. But he was, nonetheless, hysterically funny, and he reduced Jon Stewart to speechless laughter, just as he did David Letterman 20 years ago and Johnny Carson (who chose Williams to be the last comedian to appear on his show) 30 years ago.\nWhen a next-to-unknown Williams appeared at Richard Pryor's Roast in 1977, sporting a truly terrifying suit, Pryor laughed so much he looked like he was crying, and it's hard to think of a higher accolade a young comedian in the 1970s could get.\nWilliams could certainly do drama without descending into schlockiness. His performance in Awakenings was brilliantly understated and has probably lasted better than Robert De Niro's self-conscious \"I'm playing an ill person! Gimme an Oscar!\" hamminess. The last scene in Dead Poets Society still causes the hairs on my neck to rise. World's Greatest Dad and One Hour Photo astutely mined the blackness that always provided the engine to the hyper speed of his comedy. But, to borrow a phrase from another comedian, it was his \"earlier, funnier\" work that proved him to be a genius.\nMost people first met Williams as Mork, the alien from Ork who had come down to earth in a giant egg (\"Na-nu na-nu! SHAZBOT!\"). Williams stole the show from his co-star Pam Dawber, the eponymous Mindy, with his sweetness, silliness and brilliant swerves into improvisation, and it's amazing to watch the show now and see how little Williams changed, really, over the next 40 years. (It is terrifying to imagine what Williams must have been like when he was deep in his cocaine addiction, considering what he was like when he was sober.) But most people do not know that Mork was actually first introduced"}

To a people already sharply divided over settlements and their place in the peace process, the feud was seen to mirror Israeli society's inner conflicts.\nNoga Martin, a former Israeli journalist, says that she hopes to see Palestinians form an independent state. But for this to happen, she says, \"illegal outposts have to go\".\n\"They [illegal outposts] strike me as a completely unnecessary provocation that only throws fuel on the fire,\" Martin says.\n\"I have no personal hatred toward the settlers,\" she adds, \"except for the ones who act violently.\"\nDuring the annual olive harvest, settlers sometimes attack Palestinian farmers and set fire to their groves. In Hebron, a Muslim-majority city in the West Bank with a small Jewish presence, tensions flare on a regular basis - with settlers throwing stones, garbage, wine, and bottles of urine at Palestinians.\n\"They seem to be doing anything possible to fan the flames,\" Martin says of the settlers.\nBut there are sites of quiet provocation like Gilo, Pisgaat Zeev, and Givaat Zeev. All lie beyond the Green Line, the border drawn at the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Palestinian eyes these Jewish communities are part of an Israeli land grab.\nJewish Israelis simply consider Gilo and Pisgaat Zeev neighbourhoods of Jerusalem. And Givaat Zeev, further out in the West Bank, is a suburb they say.\nWhile Martin acknowledges that these areas are past the Green Line, she says: \"No one would call Gilo or Pisgat Zeev a settlement, including me.\"\nMartin maintains that she does not support settlements. But if she accepts some, where does she draw the line?\n\"It is tough to say. Look, Gilo isn't going anywhere, neither is Pisgat Zeev neither is Givaat Zeev. And even the larger settlement blocks beyond the Green Line [such as] Ariel. Let's be realistic here. You can talk about what should happen and you can talk about what's going to happen. Ariel is simply not going anywhere.\"\nAccording to Neve Gordon, author of Israel's Occupation, Martin's position is typical of Jewish Israelis.\n\"I think the settlements in many respects have been normalised,\" Gordon says. \"The discussion is no longer about settlements but outposts. Even Peace Now [a left-wing Israeli NGO that monitors and opposes settlement growth] is more concerned about counting outposts than settlements.\"\nBecause this normalisation, or resignation to the physical status quo, is so widespread amongst Israeli adults, Gordon says most Israeli youth cannot differentiate between a so-called \"neighbourhood\" of Jerusalem, like Gilo, and a Jewish community lodged in the throat of the West Bank, like Ariel.\nAnd when none of these places \"register as something illegal,\" Gordon explains, it creates de facto support. \"Once they are no longer considered settlement, that's it. The work has been done.\"\nGordon is troubled by other trends, however. He points to a recent poll conducted by the Israeli research institution Maagar Mochot,"}

Even without the emphasis of six exclamation marks, it should be obvious that this is good news.\nBut there is more to celebrate than just the program\u2019s return and improvement. IDS is a program that encourages interdisciplinary studies at the undergraduate level, which seem to be encouraged much more at the graduate and faculty levels.\nThe IDS major was able to improve by inviting full professors to teach core classes for credit toward their research funding, similar to the way Fiat Lux seminars operate, said Michael Lofchie, chair of the program.\nThis modified Fiat Lux model is one that other interdepartmental degree programs should all think about using to increase their faculty base as these programs tend to have few faculty dedicated to their departments and we cannot afford to lose the few interdisciplinary efforts that exist at the undergraduate level.\nThe interdisciplinary collaboration employed by these programs is being discouraged at the undergraduate level by the university through actions such as removing the economics/international area studies major and the political science major\u2019s allied field requirements.\nAnd while the university has some excuse in that administrators are just making pragmatic decisions based on the budget cuts, other groups lack this excuse.\nThere are very interesting interdisciplinary programs on campus that disappointingly do not work with undergraduates at all.\nThe Williams Institute of the UCLA School of Law is the only university think tank focused on sexual orientation law in the nation. It employs interdisciplinary mechanisms by working with experts in law, economics, demography, education, and public policy. While it offers law students fellowships and research opportunities, it has no means by which undergraduate students can get involved.\nAnother example of a great program not using undergraduates is the Water Technology Research Center. The WaTeR Center is working to advance \u201cscientific understanding and technological basis for the production of new water sources,\u201d\u009d according to its website, but it has no undergraduate students taking part in research.\nOne argument for these types of interdisciplinary programs not catering to undergraduates is that they are highly specialized areas of study.\nOne research area listed on the center\u2019s website is \u201cantiscalants ranking and dose optimization,\u201d\u009d which probably requires more than an undergraduate-level chemistry background.\nThe Williams Institute\u2019s specialized area of law research requires a detailed knowledge of state and federal statutes and legal theory.\nBut this argument discounts the ability of undergraduates. While no one is expecting a 19-year-old to revolutionize antiscalants ranking or convince judges of the unconstitutionality of Prop 8, undergraduates can at least assist in labs and in background research.\nMany are already doing their own research for their departments and for other programs on campus. Why not let them get involved with the interdisciplinary programs as well?\nCalifornia NanoSystems Institute, a multidisciplinary research center, offers undergraduate research opportunities and coursework in nanotoxicology, which proves that even highly specialized areas of study can offer undergraduate coursework.\nThis model of involving undergraduates should be copied by other centers on campus so that we too can take full advantage of this research university\u2019s offerings.\nHarryette Mullen, a professor of English, said that the resources for undergraduates are there, but that it is on the students to search for them with persistence.\nThere should be more opportunities for undergraduates to work across the lines"}

On the other hand, if you\u2019ve reached the point at which you don\u2019t yet feel confident that the transfer agent will change its ways without further prodding, it might be a good idea to consider making a change.\nBefore sending out the usual RFP, however, make sure ahead of time that your potential new transfer agent truly understands what you\u2019re looking for - in plain English.\nMost importantly, when researching a new transfer agent, pay little heed to the often erroneous claims many agents make as to their abilities and successes. Stay focused on the needs specific to your company and stick to these expectations, making sure the transfer agent possesses the requisite resources and track record in the areas that are important to you. The transfer agent should outline these points in its RFP response and on the tour, but you should also look for feedback from other clients who are similar in size, complexity and goals to your company."}

Similar in appearance to blueberries, bilberries are slightly smaller and darker, with a red or purple inner coloration. Notoriously difficult to grow, bilberries are usually harvested in the wild, according to Breanne FIndlay, author of \"The Celtic Diet: Let History Shape Your Future.\" Supplements derived from bilberry offer potential health benefits.\nBilberry antioxidant supplements support healthy vision by helping to regenerate light-sensitive pigments in cells of the retina, according to a study published in the September 2010 issue of the journal \"Vestnik Oftalmologii.\" Anthocyanidin compounds in bilberry protect and improve nutrient status of the retina. Bilberry extract protected the retina from damage in an animal study published in the July 2009 issue of the journal \"Molecular Nutrition and Food Research.\" In the tissue culture study, bilberry antioxidant extract prevented oxidation of lipids and inhibited nerve damage to the retina in response to a toxin.\nA combination of bilberry extract and ginkgo biloba improved vision in patients with normal-pressure glaucoma -- a condition characterized by damage to the optic nerve that can lead to a narrowing of the visual field and eventual total blindness. Participants with normal-pressure glaucoma consumed the combination supplement daily for an average of two years. Results showed a 31 percent in visual acuity, according to one rating scale, while visual field improved by 17 percent.\nBilberry supplements may help lower your blood sugar, according to an animal study published in the March 2010 \"Journal of Nutrition.\" Diets supplemented with bilberry extract decreased blood sugar levels and improved insulin sensitivity -- the appropriate response of cells to insulin -- in mice with Type 2 diabetes. Bilberry extract activated an enzyme that stimulates fat burning and inhibits cholesterol production, leading to improved glucose absorption in muscles and lower levels of glucose and fat in the liver. Some evidence shows that retinal damage due to diabetes or high blood sugar may improve with bilberry supplementation, notes New York University's Langone Medical Center.\nYour circulation may receive a boost from bilberry supplementation, according to a study published in the November 2011 issue of the journal \"Clinical Chemistry.\" Participants with elevated cholesterol consumed 320 milligrams of bilberry antioxidants per day for 12 weeks. Measurements of blood flow showed 28.4 percent improvement in the supplemented group compared to baseline blood flow measurements of the same group taken before starting the bilberry supplement. Additionally, levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the good form of cholesterol, increased significantly with bilberry supplementation, while levels of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the bad form of cholesterol, decreased.\nRoizman,, Tracey. \"What Are the Benefits of Bilberry Supplements?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate."}

Remove suckers, water sprouts, weak limbs and branches.\n- Use the right-sized tool to make pruning cuts. Loppers are used to cut branches up to one inch in diameter, and pruning saws are used for larger branches.\n- Certain species of plants are prone to disease or pests. Before investing in new trees and shrubs, find out what problems are common in your area and avoid selecting plants susceptible to them.\n- Insects and diseases are harder to control when a plant is out of place. For example, growing shade-loving plants in the open sun invites pest and disease trouble.\n- An inadequate fertilizer application will not improve color or growth, nor will it bring out the full potential of the plant.\n- Fertilizer applied at excessive rates is detrimental to plants and can damage or kill the roots. Above the ground, excess fertilizer shows up as leaf scorch and even branch dieback.\n- Fertilizer should be applied to cover as much of the root-growing zone under the plant canopy as possible. If it is misapplied to only a portion of the root zone, the fertilized area could respond differently from the unfertilized areas.\nDo you have a small laundry room?

While these machines have attracted a great deal of negative attention over the years due to their \u201csignificant social cost\u201c, Ross Ferrar, CEO of Australia\u2019s Gaming Technologies Association (GTA), recently took the opportunity to point out the huge contribution that the industry makes to the country\u2019s economy each year.\nAddressing an audience at the Australasian Gaming Expo in Sydney, Ferrar cited research carried out by the Centre for International Economics (CIE) revealing that the industry contributes $8.32 billion in revenue to the Australian economy each year, of which $5.5 billion is collected by way of tax revenue. Furthermore, an additional $284 million is generated by the exports of such gaming machines, all of which helps to fund important public infrastructure and services to the benefit of all Australians.\nThe survey (\u2018The Value of the Gaming Machine Industry in Australia\u2019) carried out by aforementioned economic consultancy firm was commissioned by the Gaming Technologies Association, an Australian industry group representing Australian gaming machine technology manufacturers, such as Aristocrat Technologies, IGT Australia, Tabcorp, Scientific Games, and Konami Australia.\nNeedless to say, Ferrar\u2019s remarks prompted a strong response from anti gambling campaign group, such as the Alliance for Gambling Reform, with the latter asserting that tax revenue produced by pokies are completely dwarfed by the harm that they inflict upon the community.\n\u201cThe social costs of gambling, including family breakdown, relationship problems, domestic violence, and emotional and psychological distress, depression and suicide, are almost $7 billion per year in Victoria alone,\u201d explained Ms Keogh, referring to a recent study undertaken by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation.\nWhile pokies undoubtedly makes a very important contribution to the national economy, they also play a significant role in earning Australia its reputation as the world\u2019s biggest gambling country per person. In 2016, for instance, Australians lost an average of AU$1,292 ($US990) per resident, as opposed to say the US whose residents lost less than half that amount. All told, betting losses per adult were around double the average reported in other Western countries. Furthermore, the country as a whole lost a staggering $24 billion gambling during the 2015-2016 fiscal year, $12 billion of which was lost on poker machines.\nOne piece of data that has been exaggerated, however, is the assertion that the country currently holds around 18% of all the slot machines in the world.

Sourcefire wins plaudits from industry analysts like Gartner for its IPS and remains the champion of the open-source IDS called Snort that was invented in 1998 by Sourcefire founder and CTO Martin Roesch.\nExactly how the companies' products will sync up remains largely a mystery though. Wall Street financial analysts and IT security analysts grilled Cisco today on whether there are either-or technology choices to be made, but the company is remaining officially mum on this topic until after the deal is finalized later this year.\nIn the near term at least, \"product integration just isn't going to happen,\" said Gartner security analyst Greg Young about the areas where Cisco and Sourcefire directly compete: IPS and NGFW. Gartner believes Cisco will go forward in the near-term after its acquisition by maintaining both the Cisco ASA firewall product line, where IPS is often a function in that, and separately support the Sourcefire IPS product lines, which have grown to include a NGFW, network-discovery tools and its FireAMP anti-malware and cloud-based threat-detection service.\nGartner's view is that it remains a long-term goal to achieve product integration in this area, though a common management console might come earlier. One influential factor is that the IPS market is not showing growth as the technology is often becoming part of firewalls, Young says.\nBut Young says a big impetus for Cisco to buy Sourcefire is simply \"security credibility,\" and adding technology and human resources to compete in a crowded IT security market. Cisco has been fighting to hold onto its lead against companies like Palo Alto Networks in NGFW, while FireEye and others make strides in anti-malware sandboxing technologies.\nChris Young, senior vice president in Cisco's security group, acknowledges that Cisco and Sourcefire compete in IDS/IPS, which Cisco often includes as part of its ASA firewalls. He says he is precluded at this time from discussing specific strategy in IDS/IPS and NGFW until after the acquisition is completed. Once the deal is finalized, Cisco plans to put forward a product road map that would include these product and service topics.\nCisco's Young did say that today the company wants to buy Sourcefire for its core technologies (including FireAMP) and threat-research expertise. Cisco is considering how to integrate FireAMP threat detection into security products such as Cisco ASA firewalls and Web security gateways, he says.\nYoung also says Cisco, which is growing more open in integrating third-party products into its products, was more than ready to take up the banner of open-source IDS. Sourcefire's Roesch is expected to be named vice president and chief architect for Cisco security, and he \"will be driving a lot of the strategy around Cisco's portfolio,\" Young says.\nFor his part, Roesch in a conference call with Wall Street analysts said discussions between Sourcefire and Cisco leading up to today's announcement had convinced him there's \"a great deal of synergy\" and that the two companies share \"similar cultural ideals"}

The number of households factors out to more than 100,000 people using the program in September.\n\"A lot of our SNAP people do work, they just don't make a lot of money. They don't make enough to survive on,\" Windom said. \"The SNAP supplements their budget. What this means to me is there are more people in Alaska that are low-income.\"\nThe number of households using the program has generally been increasing steadily since September 2016. Windom said the figures indicate there are fewer jobs in the economy or that the jobs people are getting are lower-paying positions. The state lost about 6,500 jobs last year, according to the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.\nAlaska's Medicaid caseload was also up 19 percent last month compared to the same time last year, statistics from the state health department show. Windom said that's not just because of the people now eligible for the program under its recent expansion.\n\"We're seeing an increase in overall Medicaid participation, not just the expansion group,\" she said. \"The number of parents on Medicaid is increasing, (and) the number of children.\"\nMouhcine Guettabi, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Alaska Anchorage's Institute of Social and Economic Research, said it's common for enrollment in such programs to grow during a downturn like the one Alaska is currently experiencing.\n\"It certainly appears that the stress of the local economy is showing up in these rolls,\" he said in an email, referencing Alaska numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for several assistance programs. \"We are still in the midst of the second year of a recession and the job losses result in the swelling of public assistance programs.\"\nNumbers from the USDA show that Alaska had the biggest increase in the number of households participating in SNAP of any state from July 2016 to July 2017. Most states saw caseloads decline.\nThe food stamp program is so sensitive to economic conditions, Guettabi said, that between September 2007 and September 2009 \u2014 during the Great Recession \u2014 the number of people in the program nationally grew nearly 38 percent.\nThe number of people using some other types of public assistance in Alaska, such as senior benefits or adult public assistance, has not changed much in recent years, according to data from the state health department."}

{"idx": "4955", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Washington.-- What Vice President Quayle complacently mocks as \"indulgence and self-gratification,\" the founders of this nation referred to as \"the pursuit of happiness.\" They were for it. And they believed the government's job was to provide the conditions for that pursuit, not to dictate its terms.\nMr. Quayle's own pursuit of happiness has been conventional and easy; for most others, the pursuit is a struggle. That sound you hear across the land is millions of hands slapping on foreheads as deserted wives, gays and lesbians, men and women (and children) trapped in miserable marriages, assorted misfits, and -- yes -- even some lonely middle-aged professional women who somehow never got married but want a baby anyway say, \"Why didn't I think of that? I should just be a member of a happy two-parent family with a couple of normal, healthy kids. In fact, why not go all the way and inherit a newspaper fortune while I'm at it?\"\nThe liberating social developments of the past few decades have surely had their down side, but to dismiss them all as a ghastly mistake is smug and cheap and stupid. The pill, easier divorce laws, gay rights, the increased toleration of single parenthood and other eccentric living arrangements -- all these have undermined the traditional family. They also have offered paths to happiness for millions who otherwise would be trapped by the conventions that provide the plots of so many gloomy 19th-century novels. \"Happy families are all alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\" wrote Tolstoy in \"Anna Karenina.\" Well, we've disinvented a few of those ways.\nBut does \"the turbulent legacy of the '60s and '70s,\" as Mr. Quayle would have it, include a breakdown of traditional values that members of the middle class may have managed to survive but \"the poor, with less to fall back on, did not\"?\nIt is hard to know which is more exaggerated: the notion that the problems of the ghetto can be explained \"predominantly\" (Mr. Quayle again) as \"a poverty of values,\" or the notion that the poor values of the underclass trickled down from the counterculture. Let us concede a grain of truth to both points. But if you're looking for social forces that contribute to the breakdown of traditional values and the epidemic of self-indulgence, it's absurd to obsess about Woodstock.\nEven conservative social critics have made the point that free-market capitalism, in its constant stimulation and satisfaction of appetites, is the most powerful force eroding traditional values and social arrangements. The very decision to give Murphy Brown a fatherless baby was more a product of capitalist forces -- the quest for ratings -- than of any leftover Sixties ideology. In the search for cultural influences promoting self-indulgence and immediate gratification of appetites, the Reaganite 1980s is a livelier suspect than the distant and bedraggled 1960s. Kids weren't shooting other kids over $150 gym shoes in 1969.\nTo paraphrase Goering, whenever I hear the word \"values\" I reach for my gym shoes -- in case I want to run away. The problem isn't \"family values\" themselves. They're swell, in their way. The problem is the government trying to impose them.

Dr. Hong moved to the University of Buffalo in 1956 to join Dr. Hermann Rahn\u2019s department and returned to Yonsei University in 1959. From 1959 to 1968, he rose from Assistant Professor to Professor and Chair of the Physiology Department at Yonsei. In 1968 he accepted a professorship at the University of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Physiology. He subsequently chaired that department from 1971to 1975. Dr. Hong returned to Buffalo in 1975 as a Professor of Physiology in the SUNY School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, and spent the rest of his academic career at Buffalo. In 1995, he was named SUNY Distinguished Professor, the highest academic honor which the SUNY Board of Trustees bestows on its faculty members.\nDr. Hong\u2019s principal scientific contributions were made in two areas: renal function and the physiology of diving. His work made him a major figure in both disciplines for nearly 40 years. His studies in diving physiology encompassed both human breath-hold diving and saturation diving, and were performed with colleagues in Korea, Japan, Europe and the U.S. His publications concerning breath-hold diving in the Ama, the diving women of Korea & Japan, extend over a period of 35 years, and constitute perhaps the most thorough record in the literature to date of all aspects of breath-hold diving, from thermoregulation to cardiovascular adjustments, gas exchange, nutrition, hormonal effects, and energy requirements. In the area of high pressure physiology, Dr. Hong described and characterized the phenomenon of hyperbaric diuresis in human divers. He also studied its cellular aspects, in particular the effects of hyperbaria on sodium transport in isolated epithelial cells and tissues.\nIn recognition of his scientific accomplishments, in 1963 Dr. Hong received the Samil Cultural Prize in Natural Sciences, the highest civilian award given by the Korean Government, and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Kyongpook National University in 1983. Again in 1983, he was the recipient of the Stover-Link Award from the Undersea Medical Society. In 1987, UB\u2019s School of Medicine & Biomedical Sciences awarded Dr. Hong the Stockton Kimball Prize, its premier honor for a faculty member who has excelled in research, education and service. In view of his international standing in the area of diving research, he was invited to edit a section entitled \"Adaptation to the Hyperbaric Environment\" in the prestigious Handbook of Physiology published by the American Physiological Society. He received a special citation for Distinguished Service from the panel on Diving Physiology and Technology of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources.

Instead, his lawyer did the talking.\n\"We are pleased that this case has been resolved in this fashion,\" defense attorney Benjamin Brafman told reporters.\nBrafman also pointed out his client's charity work.

The move is expected to be in place for the 2016 season, once it is approved by the league\u2019s athletic directors and college presidents.\nHarvard has not had scrimmages, or live tackling, in practice after the kickoff of the regular season in 15 years. In that time, Harvard has the second-highest winning percentage in Division 1.\nHis thoughts on the matter were reinforced after a visit with St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher in the spring of 2010.\nBefore implementing his new policy, much to the initial surprise of his players, Teevens estimated Dartmouth averaged 15 to 20 concussions per season.

Ditto for the defending state champs, Shawnee Mission West.\nThe Pioneers torched West's defense with their second-half rushing attack and took advantage of critical Viking mistakes on the final drive to pull off a 37-34 upset Thursday.\nWest had a chance to win or at least tie with under a minute remaining and first and goal. But that's where things got sloppy again for the Vikings (who turned it over four times).\nOn first down, an end zone pass went through a receiver's hands. Then on second down, quarterback AJ Verdini tripped after the snap and was tagged down. With the clock running and no time outs, Verdini spiked it, settling for a game-tying field goal.\nBut West's kicker hooked it left, setting off raucous celebration on the sideline and in the scattered group of blue-clad fans that made the 45-minute trip.\nIt wasn't supposed to go like this, of course. Leavenworth came into the game struggling to score points, and West, while having lost a large core from 2012, were still the defending state champions.\nHeading into the second half, it looked like West might cruise after shutting down the Pioneer offense for the entire second quarter.\nBut after the Pioneers' first drive of the second half sputtered, Leavenworth began lining up wide receiver Isaiah Ross in the backfield next to running back Jason Randall.\nThe adjustment worked brilliantly. With Ross and Randall in the twins formation on either side of quarterback Landry Hodges, Leavenworth began running the ball effectively to both sides.\nThe Pioneers scored on three consecutive possessions, turning West's 28-16 halftime lead into a 37-34 Leavenworth lead early in the fourth quarter, where it would stay.\nRoss finished with six carries for 84 yards, a touchdown, and an interception late that helped Leavenworth shut out the Vikings in the fourth quarter.\nRandall, the Sunflower League's leading rusher coming into play this week, had 20 carries for 179 yards and three touchdowns.\nPrevious to Thursday's game, Ross had just six carries on the season and was used almost exclusively as a receiver. But now it looks like the Pioneers have found a new weapon using the speedy junior in the backfield as a secondary option to complement the already-dynamic Randall.\nNow 2-3, Leavenworth will look to carry their momentum into next week's matchup at Olathe East.\nGame Notes: West receiver Andre Maloney suffered a possible concussion in the first half. According to a member of West's game day staff, Maloney was confused when a teammate tried talking to Maloney following his second quarter touchdown catch. Maloney reportedly didn't recognize his teammate. An ambulance was called onto the track and took the Sunflower league's leading wide receiver to an area hospital.\n- Maybe it was because it was a Thursday game, but West's student section wasn't that big, especially for a team that won it all last year. They were spirited, though. One superfan had to do 'crowd-surfing pushups' after every West touchdown, one for every Viking point.\n- Leavenworth's sideline was much more vocal than West's, with players encouraging teammates and coaches yelling out instruction.

After Rovshen was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, Shaw watched her friend suffer through a long procession of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. \"She is someone I nursed for six years,\" says Shaw, India's first biotech entrepreneur. Shaw took her on a vacation to Spain for Rovshen's 60th birthday. She died a few months later after whole-brain radiation therapy. \"I saw the struggle that she went through--the crippling financial burden, the treatments, the disease itself. I know how awful it is. I just had to do something.\"\nSo after Shaw's pharmaceutical company, Biocon, went public in 2004--making her India's richest self-made woman--she kept her promise to combat cancer. Since 2005 she's donated some $33 million to philanthropic causes, and diagnosing and researching the disease and caring for patients is a big part of this. The centerpiece is the 1,400-bed Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center , built in 2009 in Bangalore and specializing in head and neck, breast and blood-related cancers. In 2011 she added a center for advanced therapeutics with a bone marrow transplant unit. And this year she set up a research center. One area of focus is on devising more effective and safer ways to deliver drugs to patients. \"I am constantly trying to add value to what I've already built,\" she explains.\nMeanwhile, Shaw, 60, continues to support her original cause--making affordable health care more available for India's vast number of rural poor. She bankrolls the eight-year-old Biocon Foundation, which offers a micro-health-insurance scheme for villagers, runs nine primary health care clinics across Bangalore's state of Karnataka and organizes health camps. While the camps are free, the clinics and the insurance plan charge small fees. \"My legacy is going to be in affordable health care,\" she declares. \"I am willing to invest in developing that model and the policies around it.\"\nSince 2005 Shaw has turned over at least half of her annual Biocon dividends to these programs. And now she has pledged that 75% of her wealth will go to philanthropy after she dies. She hasn't been approached to sign the Giving Pledge, an effort by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to get the world's richest to give half their wealth to philanthropy. \"I would certainly sign the pledge as a way to get others to understand the importance of philanthropy to change our world,\" she says.\nShaw's commitment to her causes hasn't flagged even though her net worth has plummeted since peaking at $900 million in 2010. Last October FORBES ASIA put her fortune at $625 million after Biocon shares had fallen 40% in two years--thanks to a giant marketing deal with Pfizer falling through and then a Portuguese investment bank questioning Biocon's accounting policies; the company denied any irregularities. The shares have regained 5% recently. Biocon cut its dividend in 2009 and 2010 during the global financial crisis, but Shaw says she maintained her same level of donations."}

While the latest season moved a tad slowly in the beginning, we can see now Weiner was building up to this moment, the most striking evidence yet of Draper\u2019s decline.\nHis marriage is dead, his kids are a mess and so is business.

Anybody?\" Adams asked.\n\"Today, you're all going to be a legislator. How about that? It's going to be fun.\"\nBefore convening the day's work, members elected a president to preside over their senate.\nKyler Jones topped a field of five candidates. Adams handed him a small gavel and prompted the newly elected leader through the mechanics of passing a bill.\nThe students passionately debated two bills: one to allow students to eat candy at school any time and another to place swings on the school playground.\nOne third-grade senator called the candy bill \"a bad idea\" because it would lead to \"candy wrappers all over the floor.\"\nSpeaking for the bill, another senator argued being able to eat candy at school would stave off hunger during the academic day.\nEventually, Adams taught the students how to end debate by saying, when recognized by the Senate president, \u201cI move the previous question,\u201d he said.\nWith that, the bill went down to defeat.\nDebate on the second bill took things to the next level. The original proposal was to place swings on the school playground.\nOne senator gave this enthusiastic endorsement: \"I think it's a great idea. We could have more fun.\"\nEaston Eyre, 9, and other third-graders at Windridge Elementary School in Kaysville strain to be called on to voice their opinion on an amendment mandating safety belts on future swingsets installed on the playground during a mock Senate session on April 16, 2019.\nOther argued that kids would have to take turns to use the swings, which could lead to disputes.\nAfter a number of students raised concerns that students could be injured on swings, one senator introduced an amendment to place safety belts on the swings to prevent students from slipping out of them.\nThe amendment raised other concerns. Kids could slip and become tangled in the belts and choke. Or the belts might cut into their bellies as they swung.\n\"Kids could get killed,\" one senator cautioned.\nThe amendment was eventually defeated but the bill passed, but not by a large enough margin to render it veto proof.\nWhen bills pass the Utah Legislature, they go to Gov. Gary Herbert who decides whether to sign them into law, let them become law without his signature or veto them.\nAdams told the students that the Utah Legislature passed 574 bills during its general session this year.\n\u201cYou want to know how many he didn\u2019t like?

Barry Bonds was bananas in 2002; but he\u2019s Barry Bonds. Carlos Beltran was out of his mind in 2004, but that\u2019s Carlos Beltran. This is Daniel Murphy. A 30-year-old career .288 hitter who had never hit more than five home runs in a calendar month in his life. This patently, objectively, does not make any sense. And there\u2019s nothing to do but keep repeating how it does make any sense, because it\u2019s never going to start making more sense.\nIf you want a partial explanation for Murphy\u2019s success, the Mets\u2019 hitting coaches have been working with him this year on pulling the ball more. Murphy\u2019s always been more of a contact guy than the power hitter some thought he might be, so his coaches figured that if he\u2019s going to put the bat on the ball, he might as well try to put it where he can give it some pop. Indeed all six of Murphy\u2019s homers on his streak have gone out to right or right-center.\nOK. I\u2019ll buy that that\u2019s something. But Murphy\u2019s bat is hotter than the surface of the sun, to a degree that defies an explanation as simple as a swing adjustment. But that\u2019s the beauty of the postseason, when the last player you\u2019d expect can suddenly become a god for an at-bat, a game, or in Murphy\u2019s case, an entire series-plus. Maybe he\u2019s not fazed by the pressure of the postseason. Maybe it\u2019s a remarkable case of a guy hulking out in his contract year (this playoff run will do wonders for Murphy\u2019s first career free agency, and, ironically, ensure that he\u2019ll cost more than the Mets are willing to pay to re-sign him).

Warmer waters and bleaching have been a major problem for the Great Barrier Reef in recent years, as mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 resulted in the loss of about half its coral.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very clear outcome, the higher the numbers of larvae that you put into the reef system, the more coral recruits you get,\u201d Harrison observed.\nAs further noted by CNN, the coral IVF experiment was launched to help accelerate the repopulation process in the Great Barrier Reef and to aid its recovery from the aforementioned bleaching events. While the last Australian summer was relatively quiet, with coral bleaching far less common than it was in the two prior summers, researchers have warned that global warming could lead to bleaching events happening more frequently.\n\u201cThe Great Barrier Reef, like many reefs around the world, has suffered from almost catastrophic loss of the coral community, and what this larval restoration hopes to do is to enable the process of coral community and therefore reef recovery to occur at much faster scales than would occur naturally,\u201d Harrison told CNN, adding that further experiments will be carried out in the reef\u2019s northern area later this year.\nThe coral IVF experiment is not the only initiative scientists are working on to help save the Great Barrier Reef from further damage. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, a team of researchers developed a biodegradable coral \u201csunscreen\u201d that could work in the same way as regular sunscreen does on humans, reflecting up to 30 percent of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light, and keeping waters at a more ideal temperature, while keeping birds, fish, and other animals safe.\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that these methods, specifically the newer coral IVF process, are practical or effective enough.

Indeed, Senate Democrats (who are, after all, the minority) managed to kill a bill which would withhold funding from cities which refuse to enforce immigration law.\nSenate lawmakers on Wednesday blocked legislation aimed at stopping violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants.\nDemocrats also blocked a second related bill, the \"Stop Illegal Reentry Act,\" which would require mandatory minimum sentences standards for those who have been deported and then come back into the United States illegally and are convicted of an aggravated felony.\nThis is a major strategic disadvantage for the Republicans. On issue after issue, conservatives pass a law or a referendum, the courts throw it out, and the GOP throws up its hands and says \"oh well, the law is the law.\" When a figure like Donald Trump appears, Republicans who gleefully roll over for President Obama are suddenly stricken by \"conscience\" because they don't want to \"violate the Constitution,\" even though Barack Obama practically shreds that hallowed document on a daily basis.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are simply indifferent to the law. They know illegal immigrants will vote for them if they are given citizenship, and so they defend their interests. They know it would hurt Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming President of the United States if she is indicted, and so they turn a blind eye to her astonishing carelessness and corruption.\nAnarcho-tyranny is in effect and it will remain so as long as Republicans continue to fight with one hand tied behind their back."}
