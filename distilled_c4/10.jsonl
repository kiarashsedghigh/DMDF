The Santa Monica-based company's stock price has spiraled down 76% since the calendar rolled over to 2015. TrueCar co-founder Scott Painter took the fault for TrueCar failing to meet expectations and admitted it was time for a change as he announced he would be stepping down from his position as CEO when a replacement is found.\nIt's certainly been a rough 2015 for the company, but how bad was its second quarter, really?\nIf you weren't following closely and were simply flipping through TrueCar's Q2 slide deck starting from the top, things didn't appear terrible at first. Despite missing expectations, TrueCar posted record total revenue of $65.3 million and record transaction revenue of $60.4 million during the second quarter, which was a nearly 30% gain compared to last year.\nTrueCar users purchased more than 190,000 units from the company's certified dealership network, which was a healthy 27% increase over last year's second quarter. TrueCar-branded channel units surged 46% to more than 82,000. The company also increased its market share by 19%, or 60 basis points, from 3.4% to 4% in the second quarter compared to last year. Even its overall traffic significantly increased 42%, to 6 million average monthly unique visitors.\nIn late July, TrueCar's stock price plunged nearly 40% in one trading day because management held a preliminary conference call warning that the second-quarter results would fall short of expectations. Management revised full-year revenue guidance to check in between $252 million and $258 million rather than the previous forecast of $280 million and $290 million. TrueCar was growing, but it wasn't growing as fast as management had forecast, and the real graph that killed TrueCar's second quarter was its adjusted EBITDA.\nAs previously mentioned, if you hadn't been following TrueCar closely, you would have considered it a decent quarter until you hit slide 11, when the adjusted EBITDA was like a smack upside the head. It was a staggering drop year over year and an even worse plunge sequentially from the first quarter. It quickly put an end to the strong adjusted-EBITDA performances in the past three quarters, and TrueCar remained unprofitable in non-GAAP and net loss figures: negative $0.05 per share and negative $0.18 per share, respectively.\nThere's no question TrueCar dropped the ball, and these results not only disappointed investors but scared many away. The truth is, this is a very risky stock and business to own. The company's potential growth is tantalizing if the new CEO can figure out how to balance TrueCar's relationships with certified dealerships while making sure the company receives its fair share of payments for purchase leads, as well as rolling out new services in the years to come, such as TrueTrade in 2016.\nTrueCar will look wildly different three to five years down the line, and it's likely we'll look back at mid-2015 as either the beginning of the end or the best buying opportunity of the company's young life. Do your homework before jumping into TrueCar as an investment, and be sure to have a long-term mind"}

The conference ultimately didn't send any teams to the Final Four.\nExpect this year to be different.\nIt's not because of depth. Only seven ACC teams are in the projected field, with bubble teams Clemson and North Carolina State on the outside looking in. And it's been a down year for the league in comparison to others. The ACC ranks just fifth in the NET, the NCAA's new metric in place of the RPI.\nBut at the same time, it's been a down year for just about every conference. The Big 12 won't have a No. 1 or No. 2 seed for the first time in nearly two decades. The Big East's best projected seed is No. 4 Marquette. The Pac-12 is having a historically bad year for a power conference and could realistically only get one NCAA tourney entree. The Big Ten has had good but not great seasons for Michigan, Michigan State and Purdue.\nThis opens the door for either the ACC or SEC to potentially have three No. 1 seeds this year with Gonzaga assured of one spot. The SEC is top-heavy with Tennessee, Kentucky and LSU above the rest.\nBut while the Volunteers are currently the last projected No. 1 seed in the latest bracket and the Wildcats have a profile certainly in consideration, Virginia and Duke are far superior No. 1s and current No. 2 North Carolina has arguably a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9 than both.\nIf the Tar Heels beat Duke for a second time on Saturday, UNC will have a profile worthy of a No. 1 seed. The conversation will shift to Duke's worthiness if Zion Williamson isn't back to full strength for the ACC tournament.\nBut as long as Williamson is back for the NCAA tournament, based on credentials that include two wins over the tournament's likely top overall seed Virginia, the Blue Devils should still be in good shape.\nIt might take a run in the ACC tournament for North Carolina to confirm its No. 1 seed.

For families enrolled in the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, politicians, not parents, choose what coverage is best for the children.\nThe program was established in 1997 to help uninsured low-income kids gain coverage.

Both the House and Senate currently have bills to refund the program.\nUnfortunately, though, refunding is not all that needs to happen to ensure America\u2019s kids get the care they need.\nLawmakers should use this 20-year milestone opportunity to provide structural changes to the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that would improve the range of options that low-income American children have.\nWhile the program has reduced \u201cuninsurance\u201d among children, it has had another effect: enrolling kids in a system that keeps them dependent on the state for their health care. The program provides only limited options for engaging in the broader health care market.\nThe State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is unique in that it gives states some flexibility to decide what type of program they\u2019ll run for children. States receive a certain amount of money, and they can use that to provide a variety of different options.\nBut in most states, low-income parents are trapped in whatever program their state has chosen to pursue.\nIf you happen to live in a state that provides you more options\u2014for example, one of the handful of states that will help you pay private insurance premiums\u2014you\u2019re in luck.

Leopold raised more than $100,000 earlier this month at an exclusive fundraiser attended mainly by developers, each of whom paid the $4,000 state maximum for a campaign contribution.\nLeopold, who won election in November pledging that he wouldn't be beholden to developers, said he hasn't changed and that his record bears that out.\n\"Whether a donor gives me $4,000, $1,000 or zero dollars, it won't change the direction I will pursue in the county,\" he said.\nCritics, including his Democratic opponent last fall and a former Republican county executive, have accused Leopold of hypocrisy but acknowledged that fundraising is part of political life.\nGiven that the Leopold administration is beginning a once-a-decade review of the county's growth plan, a process that might open the door to billions of dollars in development, do you trust that he will represent the county's best interests?\nIn June of last year, as a result of my record in support of campaign finance reform, I received a Common Cause of Maryland Award for \"ethical behavior in both practice and action.\" For more than 30 years, I have fought to arrest or mitigate the influence of money in political campaigns.\nThe stark reality of political life in America today is that winning campaigns require a lot of money, and candidates must spend an inordinate amount of time fundraising. Our system is awash in money, but most reform efforts receive little traction in Congress or in state legislatures.\nThe media that decry the influence of money in the political process will, at the same time, eliminate from serious press attention candidates who fail to win the \"money primary\" by raising large sums of money. This applies to state and local candidates, as well as to presidential candidates.\nCampaign contributions should be viewed as reprehensible when there is a quid pro quo or favored treatment in exchange for the contribution. My record as county executive for the past nine months and during my previous 30 years in elective office speaks loudly that my executive and legislative actions have been in the broad public interest, not in the service of special interests seeking favored treatment.\nThe county lawsuit against E. Steuart Chaney (who contributed $2,000 to my 2006 campaign) regarding alleged illegal building at a marina in South County and my legislation to ban disposal of coal ash after receiving a large contribution from the company that has been ordered to clean up contaminated water are just two examples.\nSeveral other developers who contributed to my 2006 campaign have requested favorable treatment since my election, and their requests have been denied. These developers contributed to several county executive candidates last year, a not-uncommon practice by donors hedging their bets.\nThe Sun and the citizens of the county have every right to be vigilant to ensure that elected officials keep their commitments not to allow special interests to drive public policy. My record over three decades justifies public confidence that my commitment will be kept.\nThe writer is county executive in Anne Arundel County.\nIt is legal for politicians to hold fundraising events to win and stay in public office. It is, in fact, a political necessity without public financing of campaigns.\nSpecial interests want a voice in government decision-making and are willing to pay for the privilege.\nWhat County Executive John R. Leopold has to remember is that he is the \"people's voice\" at the table. He has an incredible amount of power to advance the common good entrusted to him by the electorate. I"}

Legend has it that Jews first settled in what is now Uzbekistan following the destruction of the First Temple. The first documented Jewish presence in the region dates back to the 4th century C.E. A large Jewish community in Samarkand is first documented in the 12th century. By the time Central Asia was annexed by Russia (1865-1873), the Bukharian Jews were a minority with diminished rights, and a small part of them, living in the Bukharian emirate, were forcibly converted to Islam (the so-called \u201ctchala\u201d). Jews were living in Bukhara, Kattakurgan, Samarkand, Tashkent, Karshi, Shakhrisabz, Kokand, Margelan, and other cities.\nThe discriminatory edicts that had existed in the Bukharian emirate with respect to Bukharian Jews (referred to as \u201cindigenous Jews\u201d) were canceled in the areas annexed by the Russian empire. After the region came under Russian rule, Ashkenazi Jews appeared there as well. At the same time the term \u201cBukharian Jews\u201d emerged \u2013 used to define Jews arriving to Russian-ruled areas from the Bukharian emirate.\nAt the end of the 19th century, there were approximately 16,000 Bukharian Jews. According to the 1926 census the number of Jews living in Usbekistan had increased to 38,200.\nIn the 1970s, about 10,000 Bukharian Jews emigrated to Israel. Both the 1979 census and the 1989 census showed 95,000 Jews still living in the republic, (26,000 of these were Bukharian Jews).\nThe state\u2019s first legal Jewish secular organizations emerged in the years 1988\u20131999. May 1990 saw nationalistic riots, which caused damage to the Jewish quarter in Andijan. During the period of mass emigration (late 1980s \u2013 early 1990s) no less than 80,000 Jews left the republic. The emigration is continuing to this day. Beside Israel and the US, small groups of Jewish emigrants have settled in Russia; there are also small communities in Austria and Germany.\nToday\u2019s Jewish population in Uzbekistan is estimated at 13,000, no more than 3,000 of whom are Bukharian Jews. Tashkent has a relatively large community (about 8,000). There are smaller communities in Samarkand and Bukhara, and quite little ones in Fergana, Andijan, Namangan, Margelan, Kokand, and Navoiy.

And the combination bolsters Bristol\u2019s pipeline significantly, with the company projecting approvals for six new drugs soon.\nCelgene has had a rough few years, though.

Turning his experiences into compelling teen fiction ended up being harrowing in its own way, writes MARC McEVOY.\nWatching children die had a profound effect on John Green's life: it convinced him to abandon his vocation to be a Christian minister and turned him into an author.\nIt was 2000 and Green, now one of the US's best-selling young-adult novelists, was fresh out of Kenyon College in Ohio, where he had studied English and religion, mostly Islamic history. He was working as a student chaplain at a hospital, counselling ''with a religious bent'' the families of children who were dying, or had died, of cancer and other illnesses.\n''I was enrolled in divinity school and thought I was going to become a minister - I'm Episcopalian - but I was disavowed of that notion pretty quickly while working at the hospital,'' Green, 34, says by phone from his home in Indianapolis.\nHe spent five months in the job that led to a crossroads.\nGreen's religious vocation was replaced by an ambition to write. He moved to Chicago, where he was a reviewer for Booklist magazine, and later to New York City, where he wrote reviews and worked in public radio while his wife, Sarah, attended graduate school.\nIn 2005 his first novel, Looking for Alaska, a coming-of-age story inspired by his time at a boarding school in Alabama, was published.\nThat changed when he discovered the voice of Hazel Grace Lancaster, the 16-year-old female narrator of his new novel, The Fault in Our Stars.\nHazel, who is also from Indianapolis, has thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. The novel begins with her meeting a support group featuring ''a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumour-driven unwellness''.\nOne is 17-year-old Augustus Waters, or Gus, who has lost a leg to osteosarcoma but is the ''hot boy'' of the group.\nGus's relationship with Hazel is the pivot for a story about young people ''learning to live with one foot in the grave'' and the value we place on lives cut short. When Hazel wants to meet the Dutch author of a novel about a girl dying of cancer that ends mid-sentence - a metaphor for her predicament - she and Gus travel to Amsterdam, where they fall in love.\nBut this is teen fiction that avoids the cliches of youthful romance and tragedy. It is punctuated by references to popular culture (America's Next Top Model), allusions to authors such as T.S. Eliot, J.D. Salinger, Emily Dickinson and Shakespeare (the title is adapted from Julius Caesar, in which Cassius says: ''The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves), and Green's signature humour.\nWriting the novel provided several challenges for Green, who has a two-year-old son and also works as a professional video blogger with his younger brother, Hank. However, using a female narrator turned out to be easier than he expected.\n''It would have been hard for me to write that story if I had started out thinking I'm going to write from a girl's perspective,'' he says.\nWriting about illness carried its own risks.\nGreen came to prominence as a writer when his first novel, in which the narrator, Miles, has been"}

The thin body and rounded edges at the rear make the device manageable in your palm, but the finger occasionally finds it tough to reach all corners of the 5.7-inch screen.\nThe Nexus phones have brought many firsts this year and one of them is the Nexus 6P\u2019s full-metal body. The device comes in three colours: Aluminium, Frost and Graphite, which is a smudge magnet. Go for Aluminium or Frost if you don\u2019t want to repeatedly wipe smudges off your device.\nThe metal unibody, chamfered edges and crisp buttons make it a premium build worthy of the flagship title. The keys are placed on the right side and a textured surface makes the power button stand out.\nOn the rear, you see the remarkable Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor, but not before your eyes wonder why Huawei placed a hump on around its camera. The Gorilla Glass-covered band, popularly called the \u2018visor\u2019, makes the phone look a bit top-heavy. While the weight balance doesn\u2019t seem to be off, the visor breaks the visual symmetry at the back. What\u2019s good about the hump? Because it is spread across the breadth, the phone doesn\u2019t wobble when kept on a flat surface.\nThe latest generation of the Samsung AMOLED display protected by Gorilla Glass 4 brings a high level of colour saturation and great black levels. The phone has better viewing angles and depth than its predecessor, the Nexus 6.\nThe dual speakers on the front sound as good as they look \u2014 wholesome and and loud, making for a great multimedia and calling experience.\nAlso, full points to the design team for the Nexus logo painted in landscape on the rear of both Nexus phones this year.\nOne of the best new features on the phone is the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor. The scanner\u2019s low-key design makes it look neat and elegant. Unless you have small hands, the index finger reaches the sensor comfortably. Unlike the Nexus 5X, the other Nexus device launched this year, there is no camera bulge close to the sensor to confuse you.\nThere is, however, one drawback \u2014 the sensor\u2019s positioning at the back means you can\u2019t access it when the phone is placed on a surface. But the niggle fades away as soon as you are introduced to the technological delight of the Nexus Imprint.\nThe fingerprint sensor is so fast and responsive, it sometimes takes you by surprise. There will be times when you won\u2019t expect the Imprint reader to accept your poorly placed finger or a split-second tap, but it still will. Setting it up is equally swift"}

Second, you can now get the game on iPad.\nFor those who missed its critically acclaimed launch back in 2012, FTL is a space-exploration roguelike for PC, Mac, and Linux. You control a single ship and a crew tasked with outrunning an enemy fleet on a randomly generated series of star systems as you attempt to deliver critical intel to your allies. Originally Kickstarted for $200,000, most of the game plays out through ship-to-ship combat where you control weapon, defensive, and support systems by moving your crew throughout the vessel.\nSo as a developer, how do you make a great game even better?

{"idx": "10052", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Some 10 percent of American adults regularly take an omega-3 supplement, despite uncertainty about whether these products truly live up to their health claims. But two new studies published in November 2018 shed some light on who might benefit from omega-3 supplements \u2014 and who probably won't.\nThe first study was the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a large multiyear study with 25,871 healthy adults with no history of cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel\u2013related) disease and at \"usual risk\" for it. The group was racially diverse and chosen to be representative of the general population, says the study's lead author Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, professor of medicine and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women's Health at Harvard Medical School.\nResearchers tested, among other things, whether a moderate dosage (1 gram a day) of an omega-3 supplement could help prevent major cardiovascular events, compared with a placebo. Cardiovascular events included not only heart attacks, but stroke, and angioplasty procedures to clear blocked arteries.\n\"The findings are somewhat complex and nuanced. It's not a simple yes, or no, or one-size-fits-all answer. Some groups tended to benefit, while other groups didn't,\" says Dr. Manson.\nAlthough a daily 1-gram omega-3 supplement did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events over all, there was a 28% reduction in heart attacks and promising signals for other heart-related endpoints, she says. While the supplement didn't seem to protect most healthy people against future heart problems, certain groups did appear to benefit, particularly people who ate less than 1.5 servings of fish a week or didn't eat fish at all. \"For these people, there was a significant 19% reduction in the primary endpoint of major cardiovascular events, with a 40 percent reduction in heart attacks,\" says Dr. Manson.\nThe supplements also appeared to benefit African American participants, who saw a 77% reduction in heart attack for those receiving the omega-3 supplement, compared with those taking the placebo, says Dr. Manson. It's unclear why this group benefited more, and additional studies are needed to confirm the finding.\nThe second study, called the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA\u2013Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT), included more than 8,000 middle-aged and older adults who had elevated triglyceride levels and who had already experienced a cardiovascular event or had other significant risk factors for one. It aimed to find out if a daily high-dose, 4-gram prescription omega-3 medication could protect participants against future cardiovascular events, compared with a placebo. This trial, led by Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, found a substantial 25% reduction in the risk of dying from heart disease or suffering a cardiovascular event among people who took the medication, compared with those who had the placebo.\nHigh doses of omega-3 supplements, like the high-dose omega-3 product used in this trial, aren't appropriate for everyone because they pose risks, such as bleeding or an increase in a type of abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation, says Dr. Manson. \"However, while high doses are associated with some risk, overall benefits of the high-dose omega-3 product used in the trial appeared to outweigh the risks for people with"}

The district also had to postpone opening the newly built Adelanto High School until the 2014-15 school year due to its financial troubles. A county-appointed fiscal adviser worked with VVUHSD officials for one year in order to get the district's budget in order and cleared by the state in October.\nTeachers union president Jose Berrios argues that the financial \"crisis is over.\" VVUHSD officials project a nearly $15 million ending fund balance for the 2013-14 school year, and $19 million the following year, Berrios said.\n\"It's worked out that they're not going to be bankrupt, and now they want to continue with furlough days,\" said Berrios, a teacher at VVUHSD for 35 years. \"We've been taking cuts through this whole thing and now the crisis is over. With the money we have projected, we don't need furloughs.\"\nUnion leaders say district officials have not made good on a promise to return the furloughs when the fiscal emergency was over. An email and phone call to the district's assistant superintendent of business services seeking comment was not immediately returned Wednesday.\nTeachers picketing outside the district's main office Wednesday held signs with slogans such as: \"Where's The Funding?\" ... \"Over $8 million for books, where are they?\" ... \"Shame on VVUHSD\" ... \"Honor the contract\" ... \"VVUHSD Y U no like teachers?\" ... \"Put students first\" ... \"Teaching's a profession, not a 'job'\" and \"Students are the reason.\"\nSandra Bagnol, a teacher at University Prep, said that she was picketing to support her colleagues at other schools who lacked basic supplies and teaching materials, including books for college-bound students in advanced placement classes at Adelanto High School.

All our data activity must be compliant with data protection legislation.\n\"We want to reassure applicants that we do not allow access to their information by any unauthorised person or body, and may only share data where it is necessary and where we have a legal basis for doing so.\"\nThe Home Office has confirmed that it will take data from two other government departments \u2014 Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work & Pensions \u2014 which will be processed using an algorithm which will either accept or reject applicants.\nHowever, the UK government has refused to publish details of how this cross-governmental automated checking will work, saying only that it will not retain data from other government departments that have been used to make the decision.\nThe so-called \"memorandum of understanding\" between the Home Office and HMRC also shows that the department will seek a wide range of information, some of which is not necessary to prove residency.\nTransparency campaigners are pushing for the government to reveal how the data will be used.\n\"Unless there's something very odd going on, it really wouldn't be that difficult for the Home Office to publish far more information about how it has designed the system and the rationale it is using, as well as the individual data the applicants are being assessed on,\" Philip Booth, a data transparency campaigner who published a report on data use in the the settled status scheme, told BI.\nCampaigners also suggest that the Home Office scheme could be breaching official privacy rules and be unlawful.\n\"The EU General Data Protection"}

Plush called 911 twice, but the GPS information from his iPhone never got to the officers.\nApple is rolling out a new feature in its next iPhone software update to send emergency responders instant, precise location information in the US. The update, coming in iOS 12 later this year, calculates a caller's location based on data collected from WiFi access points, nearby cellular towers, and GPS.\nThe tricky part isn't finding out where a caller is -- Apple has been using its hybrid location technology since 2015 -- but relaying that information to a fragmented and aging 911 system built for landlines.\nOf the 240 million calls made to 911 each year, more than 80 percent are from mobile devices, according to the National Emergency Number Association.\nApple is working with a startup called RapidSOS, which specializes in sharing a cell phone's location information to the major programs used by the 6,300 emergency response departments across the US. RapidSOS offers its integration as a free software update to existing 911 dispatch systems.\nThe companies announced the feature Monday at the NENA conference in Nashville.\n\"The 911 system is literally 50 years old this year. It has not made the evolution into the digital era,\" said former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who is an investor in RapidSOS.\nWheeler has been pushing for more accurate 911 location information since he was at the FCC, but only invested in RapidSOS after he left in 2017. Two other former FCC chairmen, Dennis Patrick and Julius Genachowski, are also investors.\nNot all callers in an emergency know where they are, and some cannot verbally communicate their location. They might be in medical distress, or unable to speak because it would put them in danger. In those cases, calls from mobile numbers have to be located using cell tower information from carriers, which can result in a radius of hundreds of yards.\nGetting medical attention in the first 60-minutes after a traumatic injury is key to preventing death. Emergency professionals call this window the \"golden hour.\" In a 2014 report, the FCC estimated inadequate location information leads to more than 10,000 unnecessary deaths a year.\nOver the past five years, RapidSOS has visited thousands of public safety agencies around the country, said founder and CEO Michael Martin. The challenge was finding the ways to work with all of those systems without slowing down responses or overloading dispatchers with information.\nNow when a 911 center receives a call from a device using RapidSOS's technology, the dispatcher's software asks the RapidSOS database for more data. In addition to location data, RapidSOS might have other data like a person's medical records.\nThe company recently announced a partnership with Uber, which adds a button for calling 911 inside of the ride-hailing app. Google did a pilot program with"}

As a presenter is talking, she can see the questions and respond to them, without waiting for someone to speak into a microphone.\nGoogle Slides Q&A's presenter view lets presenters see what people in their audience want to know.\nIn addition to submitting questions, audience members can also vote on which ones they want to see answered. That means presenters facing a mountain of queries can filter by the most liked and tackle an audience's burning questions.\nPresenters won't have to worry about making sure that a microphone is set up for audience Q&A, and can instead focus on walking in, giving their presentation, and taking feedback from the audience.\nIt's also a boon for audience members who are more comfortable typing than getting up and asking a question. Asking a question in front of a big group of people can be a daunting task, and being able to craft just the right question in text form may help expand the questioner pool to more people.\nThe Q&A feature will also be especially useful for people who are having their presentations streamed over the Internet. By using Slides Q&A, they can take questions from around the world, without requiring that askers be in the same room.\nThe new feature integrates well with Google Hangouts, too. Google announced Wednesday that iPhone and iPad users can now present straight to one of the company's live streaming video sessions using their mobile device, making it easy to distribute a presentation to a wide variety of people.\nGoogle's move here could be a strike against other live commenting services, especially those tied to streaming platforms like Facebook Live and Periscope.

North Carolina, however, has a \u201ccertificate of need\u201d (CON) law, requiring Singh to prove to the Soviet-style central planners in the state government that Singh\u2019s area needs another machine.\nSuch state and local CON laws proliferated in the 1970s as the federal government began pouring money into health care, and government-funded hospitals tried to protect their revenue streams. Just for the privilege of submitting an application to buy an MRI, Singh would have to pay a nonrefundable $5,000 fee and be prepared to spend $400,000 (lawyers, consultants, economists) to surmount the opposition of determined competitors.

And the audacity of economic interests clamoring for government protection from domestic competition seems to be increasing as the Trump administration, with tariffs and import quotas, practices crony capitalism to protect favored industries and companies from foreign competition.\nFor example, this month a federal court \u2014 following the example of other courts that have swatted aside cases from Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Georgia \u2014 unanimously rejected this preposterous argument from Miami-Dade County (Florida) taxi owners: The U.S Constitution says private property shall not be taken for \u201cpublic use\u201d without just compensation, so they should be compensated because the government has permitted ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber and Lyft) that have substantially reduced the value of the owners\u2019 taxi medallions.

Well, we do, it\u2019s for the sake of size but with a negative impact on the typical scale of image preview. On the positive side, that screen is mounted on a flip-up bracket and so can be positioned too far forward for selfies - just like the NEX-5T model.\nThe small scale of the A5000 is a giant benefit. Weighing a mere 210g, the camera is definitely lightweight in the hand, and yet doesn\u2019t feel cheap and plasticky. The white model we saw on the Sony stand exuded quality for such an entry-level class model.\nThe A5000 has the Sony E-mount - the very same mount established with the birth of NEX. Even though this is an Alpha camera it\u2019s not compatible with A-mount lenses unless you buy into an additional adaptor. That's a bit confusing in some respects, but stick to E-mount and all will be fine. Although at this price point we suspect most owners won\u2019t buy in to giant selections of lenses and will rely on the 16-50mm power zoom lens shown here. It collapses into itself when the camera is off to keep that size down as much as possible. It adds some additional weight, but the camera still feels light.\nAutofocus has improved in Sony's cameras over recent years too, and while the A5000 doesn't have on-sensor phase detection capabilities, it still felt swift when snapping subjects into focus. No problems here, even if it's technically not as fast as something like the Olympus OM-D.\nThe camera's layout doesn't offer a mode dial, harking back to the earlier NEX camera models. This isn't a giant problem, but it does make the process of menu digging all the time to adjust modes a little irksome. And the Sony menu layout also takes some getting used to based on where various options \"live\".\nElsewhere the features list boasts a 20-megapixel APS-C sensor and, as mentioned, Wi-Fi in addition to NFC. We weren\u2019t able to test these to the max on the show floor given the short time we spent with the camera, but given just how good Sony image quality has been in previous models we have high hopes for the A5000.

Yes, please make note on your calendar that new episodes of \u201cIf Loving You is Wrong\u201d airs on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. This week\u2019s episode, \u2018Chest Pains\u2019 picked up precisely where last week left off with Steven being attacked by Eddie\u2019s goons. Let\u2019s just say Steven is not one to be messed with, he kicked the crap out of these guys and in a vicious manner to say the least.\nEsperanza alerted Lushion of the situation, and was worried that Steven might take matters into his own hands and do something that should have been done a long time ago. Lushion was none too pleased to be disturbed in the middle of the night with more nonsense. To be honest I do not blame him; it\u2019s like this guy can never get a moment of peace because everyone and I mean everyone has a freaking problem.\nEddie was not pleased to see that his goons were not able neutralize Steven, who entered the pub and placed a massive beating on Eddie! I was shouting to the Gods to see this finally transpire. Steven went to town on Eddie\u2019s face, and it seemed like our dirty cop learned once and for all that there are some people not to be messed with. Ian was searching for paperwork when he was interrupted by Larry who was inquisitive why he was working on the Travis King file. Ian looked like he was about to do something noble, but Larry was against it because of the issue of money. It always comes back to money. Larry is a bit of a tool and the fact that Eddie held him hostage and beat the crap out of him; I don\u2019t feel too bad about it now. Does that make me a bad person? I think not.\nKelly came face-to-face with a member from Calvary, the church that Travis attended and it appears his members were hoodwinked by his good boy persona. Hmm, interesting development that Travis seemed to have a pattern of stalking and terrorizing women, and that woman slipped up America. Kelly started preaching and it caught this godly woman off guard. Kelly faked having chest pains in an effort to get seen by doctors; smart girl.\nThis crap with Alex and Dr. Raston was a complete waste of time. At this point I don\u2019t even care who switched the damn DNA results. So if the writers try to pull that Alex\u2019s baby is actually Brad\u2019s and not Randal\u2019s I will absolutely die i.e. be floored. Getting beat to a pulp won\u2019t help Eddie see the light of the day and he spotted Kelly to annoy yet another person. He decided to antagonize her, and she traded spars back at him before Rick interrupted the melee. So it looks like Rick might be Kelly knight in shining armor. Rick started to share some details that he has some insider information that might help her case, but the question we all have is why now?\nNatalie wanted Esperanza to shut things down once and for all with Eddie to prevent any further violence or mayhem. Esperanza heeded Natalie\u2019s advice and decided to reach out to Eddie and have a conversation with him about his antics. Steven apologized to Esperanza for his antics and the discussion"}

Our favourite Kickstarter project this week is Mann\u2019s incredibly ambitious Song-A-Day \u2014 an ongoing effort that is nearing its final goal of 1,000 consecutive, unique songs. Jonathan Mann started the Song-A-Day project on January 1st, 2009 and, since then, has gone on to fulfill the nearly impossible expectations he set for himself by writing and recording an original number every day. On September 28th, 2011, Mann will have reached the 1,000 song milestone that signals the end of his work \u2014 for now \u2014 and has taken to Kickstarter in order to bring the entire affair to a suitably celebratory finish.\nThe songwriting and recording to date has mostly been provided entirely by Mann himself \u2014 whether he\u2019s singing about having food poisoning or chronicling his baby niece learning to walk \u2014 but, this June he\u2019s looking to bring his ongoing work to a triumphant end with a little help from his friends.\nMann has stated before that he\u2019s been unable to recruit other musicians because, well, he has no money to give them. Writing a daily song is a time committment that most professional musicians can\u2019t afford to embark on and, because of this, Song-A-Day has usually been a solo affair. Now, however, Mann is looking for some help from his fans so that he\u2019s able to bankroll a full band of collaboraters for the month of June. By using these donations the month will yield thirty days and thirty more original songs written and performed by a group.\nJonathan Mann\u2019s Kickstarter project is looking for contributors that can help support his work by allowing him the money required for properly capping off the finishing run of his years of effort. As mentioned before, funds will go toward paying musicians to take a month off from their day jobs. It will also be used in the recording and production of a ten-track album that rounds up the best of the Song-A-Day catalog and refines it into a properly mixed and mastered release. Some of the money will also be directed toward gear rental (microphones, pre-amps, etc.) and travel expenses necessary for getting all of the musician\u2019s in one place.\nFor the materialistic among us, there are plenty of rewards on offer. Signed copies of the finished album, one-of-a-kind polaroids from the studio sessions, a personally suggested Song-A-Day entry (pledgers come up with the topic, Mann makes it happen) and even freshly baked cookies are all available. The different pledge levels each provide something original and worth the donation for fans of the artist that want to lend their support while still netting some cool swag for doing so.\nTo donate to Song-A-Day by Jonathan Mann, head over to the Kickstarter project page by pressing a mouse button on this link.

Shaw, who snatched the assault rifle from the suspect after he opened fire, is being hailed as a hero.\nAt a press conference on Sunday, Shaw Jr said he had heard gunshots and glass smashing as people ran for cover.

They are planning a nationwide social media campaign, or \"virtual march,\" to encourage people to use the Internet -- email, Facebook, Twitter -- to tell lawmakers they want immigration reform -- a grass-roots tactic that last year helped Silicon Valley rally opposition to proposed legislation to combat piracy and established the high-tech industry as a political force. Silicon Valley has also begun to quietly lobby lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House.\nObama, in his State of the Union speech in February, called for \"real reform\" that would \"attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.\"\nImmigration reform for high-tech workers is also gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, where a bipartisan group of eight senators is working on comprehensive legislation.\nStill, reform is far from certain. Democrats are insisting on a single bill on immigration while some Republicans oppose key elements of a broad overhaul. Even the growing number of lawmakers who support reform worry it could harm American workers.\nThe Obama administration has its own immigration bill ready to go if congressional talks break down, but White House senior advisors have not tipped their hand to the high-tech industry on what that would mean for it.\nMarty, the son of Cuban immigrants, and Mutabdzija, who came to the United States as a refugee from the war-torn former Yugoslavia, said they grew weary of all the political talk about immigration reform in Washington.

Similar air-clearing measures had mixed results during the peak Winter smog season but this time citizens are hoping for better results.\nFor the two weeks starting April 15, most cars in the Indian capital will only be allowed on the roads every other weekday. In the so-called odd-even program, cars with license plate numbers that end in odd numbers are allowed on the roads on odd-numbered days and Sundays while cars with even license plate numbers are allowed on even days and Sundays.\nFor the first few days of the plan most offices and schools were closed for a string of national holidays and the weekend, so Monday is the true test of whether the restrictions are working.\n\"Today is the litmus test for the odd-even plan. Like the last time, we all need to cooperate to make it a success,\" Delhi's Transport Minister Gopal Rai tweeted from his verified account on Monday.\nThere are 2.6 million private cars and almost 5 million motorcycles and scooters registered in Delhi, according to the latest figures from the capital\u2019s Transport Ministry.\nThere are many exceptions to the regulations, meaning the number of cars on the streets will not be slashed by half. Women driving alone or with children, disabled drivers, emergency services, cars with diplomatic plates and motorcyclists are all exempt from the restrictions as are military vehicles and taxis.\nCommuter Raj Kumar Sharma said the city needs to expand its public-transportation infrastructure by adding more trains and buses before it tells drivers they can\u2019t use their cars half the time.\n\"Unless you have a proper transport system, what's the point in penalizing single-car owners like me in this sweltering heat,\" he said.\nSome politicians of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which does not run Delhi, seemed to agree.\n\"Why not make OddEven a permanent feature? If there is no infrastructure then first build the infrastructure and then implement it in one go,\" tweeted Vijay Goel, a BJP lawmaker.\nIn Delhi, levels of dangerous particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, which can cause serious respiratory illnesses, regularly exceed the amount deemed safe by the World Health Organization. The particles, from dirt, soot and smoke, can lodge in the lungs and cause respiratory illnesses. On many days Delhi records higher PM 2.5 levels than anywhere else in the world.\nWhether restrictions on cars alone can solve the problem is debated. Delhi implemented similar restrictions in January and there was not a huge difference in pollution levels. A study by Delhi-based think-tank--the Council of Energy, Environment and Water-- that independently measured air quality and traffic volumes at five locations in the capital, showed that pollution levels in the two weeks of January were actually worse than those observed in the last week of December."}

He never let the job get him down, well not for long anyway, but it must have been tough going for such a caring man.\nThen he would go stone mad in the commentary box when Kerry were playing. There were times when you'd swear you were listening to a South American soccer commentator shouting 'gooooooooal'.

According to reports from ESPN, the Broncos are looking to move on from the star wide receiver and are listening to trade offers.\nThomas is the longest-serving Bronco currently playing for the team, having been drafted by Denver with their first-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. In that time, he&apos;s been to six Pro Bowls and one Super Bowl, joining in the team&apos;s victory in Super Bowl 50.\nThe 30-year-old receiver broke 1,000 yards every season between 2012 and 2016, failing to hit that mark last season for the first time in a season in which he played all 16 games. Even then, Thomas fell just short of the mark with 949 yards. He holds the Broncos records for most receiving yards and touchdowns in a season.\nHowever, Denver looks ready to move on. With the addition of Courtland Sutton, it seems like the team is looking to offload their veteran pass-catcher before the October 30 trade deadline.\nESPN&apos;s Adam Schefter reports that \"a handful of teams\" have expressed interest in trading for Thomas.

The scams have caused more than $10.8 million in losses nationwide.\nScammers target students by emailing them convincing job recruiting messages or posting fake online job advertisements on college employment websites, according to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center.\nThe Federal Trade Commission said that a red flag for any job posting is whether it requires an applicant to enter a credit card or bank account number. Scammers charge job seekers an upfront fee for supposed training materials or services, claiming to guarantee job placement after payment. Once they acquire the information, scammers do not provide a guaranteed job or return calls.\nResearch the business first. Directly contact companies that are mentioned in ads or interviews to make sure they are really hiring through the service. Make sure to check the website of the company posting the advertisement, because scammers often use fake names similar to reputable companies to trick job seekers.\nBe cautious with what you click and the information you give. If you receive an unsolicited email, don\u2019t click on any links in it until you have researched the business and can confirm that the email came from an authentic source. Though legitimate employers will need Social Security numbers and might need a bank account number, be wary of any email asking for that information if you haven\u2019t met someone in person.\nDon\u2019t pay upfront fees. No legitimate job offer will ask an applicant to pay for credit reports, background checks or administrative fees before an interview. Scammers will often say it\u2019s for certification or training materials, but don\u2019t fall victim to this trick. Job seekers should also never give away bank account information until they have officially been hired.\nDon\u2019t wire money to someone you don\u2019t know. Scammers know that once you wire money, it is almost impossible to get it back. They will often ask you to send money through MoneyGram or Western Union, which makes money very difficult to track.\nProtect your documents. Keep sensitive personal and financial documents somewhere secure, such as in a safety deposit box or at home with your parents. Shred paper documents that include any personal financial information such as your Social Security, credit card or bank account numbers. Make sure important mail is sent to a permanent home address. School mailboxes are not necessarily secure and can be easily accessed in a dorm or apartment.\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

EURACTIV Spain reports.\nThe Ukraine\u2013European Union Association Agreement entered into force on 1 September 1 \u2013 an important step for bilateral relations. For the past three months, Ukrainians have been able to travel to the EU without a visa.\nIvanna Klympush-Tsynadze explained what this agreement entails for her country, what her government has done until now and what Ukraine can offer to the EU.\nWhat are the primary benefits for Ukraine?\nWe see this Agreement as a reform plan to achieve the successful economic and political systems of European member states. We already started to reform before the Agreement came into force.\nThe Agreement is highly ambitious and resembles the plans that Eastern European countries adopted before entering the EU. A complex agreement such as this depends on all actors in Ukraine who initiated this momentous change, as well as civil society, to succeed.\nBut we are aware that our efforts alone are not sufficient, but we need the EU\u2019s technical and economic support to ensure that all these changes are actually implemented on schedule.\nUkraine\u2019s current government has achieved visa-free travel to the EU for your citizens. What does this mean for EU-Ukraine relations?\nI believe this was hugely important for Ukraine. We cut ties with our Soviet past, the Russian empire. The EU\u2019s acknowledgement of all our efforts was instrumental. We worked closely with the president, the parliament, civil society and our European partners.\nI am saddened by the setbacks this process is suffering from \u2013 and not due to Ukraine but to internal EU affairs. I hope these political barriers, which weighed on the decision to enlarge visa-free travel, have less importance in European member states. I see a centrist swing within many countries, which are open to engaging in cooperation with Ukraine.\nExtending the visa regime also means enhancing personal and trade relations. It entails a clearer understanding of who Ukrainians are and putting an end to the myths which the Russian Federation promotes to European countries. This direct communication between citizens will yield positive results for the process of European integration.\nUkraine\u2019s government has talked repeatedly of \u201cthe European future of the country\u201d. What does Ukraine have to offer to the EU?\nNot only can we advance these gains, but we are already doing a lot. Right now Ukraine is the frontier of the West. On the Eastern border, we are protecting against a Russian attack. This is how we are contributing to EU\u2019s security.\nUkraine is a large country, with an educated labour force. It is a safe country for investment, a market for EU products, and a quality producer in numerous sectors including food production and innovation. We are leaders in IT industry among developing countries. So we have a lot to offer in economic and security terms.\nYou said in an interview that the Association Agreement \u201cis a difficult task\u201d. What are the biggest challenges to overcome?\nThe biggest challenge is that in some sectors the result of our reforms are not immediate, and citizens will appreciate the benefits with time. We need widespread support to really bring about change.\nFor instance, implementing the EU\u2019s environment directives is a hard job. Citizens do not see its short-term importance, and the long term ecological risks lying ahead. People do not think about the long term \u2013 they want to see results in one or two years.

In an era of tight budgets and rising deficits, candidates sometimes sound like they are running for accountant, not Congressman.\nThe conventional wisdom in the capital this year says that the Congressional elections reflect no national themes or trends. And apart from a Republican radio and television campaign aimed at youthful voters in about a dozen states, neither party is running national commercials advancing a single campaign message.\nBut a close look at about two dozen of the closest House races this fall discloses a number of common threads and strategies. And to a significant extent, these strategies are being hatched by party officials in Washington who keep in constant touch with campaigns around the country, often through the use of advanced computer networks.\nTrying to brand the Democrats as profligate budget-busters is hardly a new tactic for the Republicans, but it ranks high on their hit parade of past successes.\nDemocrats are going to great lengths this year to demonstrate their tight-fisted patriotism. In New York's 30th District, centered in Rochester, Louise Slaughter, the Democrat challenging Representative Fred J. Eckert, has a commercial that shows her standing in front of a bank of American flags while an original tune, ''Standing Up for Us,'' plays in the background.\nPhil Davis, the Democratic nominee in Arizona's Fourth District, jokes that his pinstripe suits and conservative ties ''make me look like a Republican.'' Mr. Davis, who is running against John Kyl, also stresses a record as a successful real estate developer to buttress the claim that he can find practical solutions to tough problems.\nSince the Democrats hold a 73-seat advantage in the House today, Republicans are frequently running against well-entrenched incumbents, and they look for ways to undermine the relationship between a representative and his constituents.\nMany Republican strategists are trying to duplicate the success in 1984 of Mitch McConnell, the party's Senate candidate in Kentucky, who won an upset victory by focusing on the mediocre attendance record of Walter D. Huddleston, the Democrat who was then the incumbent.\nA good example is Pennsylvania's 18th District, in suburban Pittsburgh, where the Republican challenger, Ernie Buckman, is stressing the argument that Representative Doug Walgren has passed only one bill in 10 years in the House.\nMr. Walgren replies, ''The voters have been deeply misled about my effectiveness, but my opponent knows that if he can't tear me down personally, he can't win.'' But Does He Live Here?

Mr. Carr declines to discuss details of the charge, but stresses his service to the district and his independance from party leaders back in Washington.\nIn searching for a theme of their own, Democrats have lately been focusing on the slumping economy, particularly in the central states suffering from sliding fortunes in the agriculture, energy and timber industries."}

In the hall filled with polished wooden pews, lit through majestic stained-glass windows, and studded with Corinthian columns, Jackson unleashes his distinctive blend of religious fervor and self-help bromides, ending in a brow-mopping series of invocations.\nIn competitive runs for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, Jackson harnessed his unique brand of Pentecostal populism to become the first African American taken seriously as a contender for the presidency. He won seven million votes in 1988 as a progressive alternative to the nominee who bested him, Michael Dukakis. Since then, Jackson has stayed active \u2014 sometimes in ways that have troubled former supporters.\nMuch of Jackson\u2019s energy these days turns on his Wall Street Project, launched three years ago to \u201copen up access to capital for women and minorities.\u201d The effort has also opened up access for the project itself, which counts Bell Atlantic, GTE, and the New York Stock Exchange as its biggest corporate sponsors. Among other efforts, the project joined with the Security Industry Association to distribute the Stock Market Game, a board game that teaches kids about investing, to public schools across the country.\nThe approach has caused whiplash among followers who consider Jackson their anti-corporate tribune. Some progressives also accuse him of being largely absent from the debate over Clinton\u2019s dismantling of welfare.\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1988, you said you were \u201cenhancing black and progressive politics.\u201d Why did you decide not to continue your efforts to enhance those politics through a candidacy?\nAt the time, I was thinking: What was the coalition that could stop the Reagan-Bush legacy? Even at the low moments, I\u2019m glad that we defeated the Reagan-Bush lineage. Eight years later, we have gone from debt to surplus, more people are working, we have unprecedented economic growth, and while the wealth is not as evenly spread as it ought to be, more people have benefited.\nWas it a difficult decision to stay out of the race in \u201992, \u201996, and again in 2000?\nNo, because I remain active. I didn\u2019t sit idly by, rolling my thumbs. We kept registering voters, we kept winning campaigns. There were coattails. In many ways Clinton inherited much of what we had done.\nMore than that, we raised the issue in 1984 of the U.S. connection to South Africa being a moral disgrace. Neither party would touch Mandela or South Africa then. Now he\u2019s a global hero"}

Though I dreaded reliving that race as much as anyone, I would never deny the deep reporting of John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, and bow before the bizarre scoopage they\u2019ve shown off here.\nBachmann\u2019s brain. The authors confirm not just that Rep. Michele Bachmann suffered from migraines, but that she had one the night before the Ames, Iowa, debate.\nThe candidate was lying in the dark in her hotel in the fetal position, trying to ward off an intracranial onslaught. A doctor was placed on standby. A hospital was notified. A hefty dose of drugs was obtained and administered \u2013 and, glory be, the meds worked.\nAnd that\u2019s just strange, because Bachmann\u2019s attacks on the governor during that debate were about issues she should have known about, given that she served in the Minnesota state Senate when Pawlenty was governor. The only real Bachmann-Pawlenty contretemps\u2014this the day before one of them was expected to win the straw poll (Ron Paul ended up coming second, anyway)\u2014was over a cigarette tax deal.\n\u201cWhen the deal was put together, Governor Pawlenty cut a deal with the special interest groups and he put in the same bill, a vote to increase the cigarette tax as well as the vote that would take away protections from the unborn,\u201d claimed Bachmann.\nThis required the incognito trading of an oppo file?\nWhat follows in the book is a hilarious short play about how gormless the \u201cAmericans Elect\u201d process was.

{"idx": "10095", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Tomb Raider was in a creative rut last we saw it, with stagnant gameplay and a dull lead character. However, Lara Croft has undergone quite a transformation in the five years since Tomb Raider Underworld. The new Lara might not be recognizable to the fans who knew her way back when but these changes are for the best.\nIn the game, Lara Croft is no longer the back-flipping, expert treasure hunter with uzis in each hand. Instead, she's a fresh-faced graduate on her first journey. Minutes after the game starts, she's shipwrecked on an island populated by wolves, murderous salvagers and other dangers. The game follows her evolution from scared young girl into hardened adventurer.\nThe evolution's a lot quicker than it ought to be. She'll be shooting enemies by the dozens within the first half hour of the campaign. Ultimately the demands of an action genre beat out the desire to tell a grounded story. Still, Lara has never been a more compelling character. The events of the game take an emotional and physical toll on her. Her transformation into a hero might happen too quickly, but the key thing is that there's a transformation there. In previous games, she was an unflappable action hero who tracks down treasure for funsies. Here, she's in over her head and has to grow up quickly in order to survive.\nThe trailers might lead you to think that survival is a big portion of the game. However, this isn't S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or DayZ. You're not going to be foraging for food and water. You have to kill exactly one deer in the campaign, and that piece of venison apparently tides you over for the rest of the game. Instead, the game challenges players with a mixture of combat, puzzles and platforming.\nThe combat is surprisingly deft. It avoids the plodding, whack-a-mole of other third-person, cover-based shooters. You can't just sit in a corner and snipe off one enemy at a time. Enemies force you to keep moving. Salvagers will toss molotov cocktails and dynamite at you or shoot up your cover. Wolves and blade-wielding enemies will charge your position as well. The charging enemies even do little side-steps to throw off your aim. Each battle is fast-paced and frantic, with bow-and-arrow headshots, assault rifle barrages and axe swipes.\nQuick Time Events rear their ugly head occasionally. The first fifteen minutes of the game will make you think they're more common than they actually are, though. For the most part they're used sparingly. I do wish they weren't utilized for key story moments of the game, though. I had to rewatch a few scenes because I didn't hit \"Y\" in time to avoid a death blow.\nPlatforming was a big part of previous Tomb Raider games and there's plenty of swinging and climbing here. You won't fight with the camera as much as you did in earlier installments. However, the jumping and climbing are effortless. It doesn't test your twitch skills at all. Instead, these parts of the game are like eye candy.\nThe puzzles, though engaging, are likewise reduced in importance for this game. There's a decent amount in the campaign but they're all fairly short. Furthermore, many of them are found in optional tombs hidden throughout the island. They're much more approachable than in past games thanks to a new ability called Surv"}

Because they are marginalized, their use of drugs has often gone up, and has been accompanied by HIV and hepatitis C infections.\"\nDr. Kendall and other B.C. health officials' call to decriminalize personal drug use and possession echoes that of the John Hopkins University \u2013 Lancet Commission on Public Health and International Drug Policy. The international commission of medical experts recently asserted that the \"war on drugs\" has undercut public health and resulted in collateral harms while doing little to affect drug markets or address drug use.\nCanada and the United States are currently grappling with opioid-related crises; B.C. declared a public health emergency last week over a significant increase in illicit drug overdoses. In Kamloops on Thursday, fentanyl was suspected in six non-fatal overdoses in a couple of hours.\nDr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer and vice-president of public health for Vancouver Coastal Health, said she supports a regulatory approach to all psychoactive substances.\n\"Personally, I think we need to be thinking about the decriminalization of drug use and perhaps having legal options for all drug users, including opioid drug users, so that they don't have to go to the illicit drug market for their addiction,\" she said.\nB.C. Health Minister Terry Lake suggested decriminalization is a direction worth considering.\n\"As Health Minister, public health is always the biggest priority,\" he said. \"I'm not the justice minister, I'm not the attorney-general, so I don't want to speak for them, but I would say that we have recognized over the years that the war on drugs has largely been a failure.\n\"And I think all levels of government are recognizing that, so let's put a public health lens on this, treat it as a health and social issue that we need to manage \u2026 I think there's a general movement in that direction.\"\nDr. Kendall noted that Portugal experienced significant benefits after decriminalizing all drugs in 2001. This included reduced rates of incarceration and associated harms and control of an HIV epidemic linked to unsafe injections. As of 2011, Portugal's total drug use is among the lowest in the European Union, according to the international public health commission.\nThe commission published a report on the matter shortly before this week's United Nations General Assembly Special Session on drugs, held in New York, where UN member states convened for the first time to discuss global drug strategies since 1998.\nThe commission is recommending the decriminalization of all minor, non-violent drug offences \u2013 use, possession and petty sale \u2013 and the strengthening of health and social-sector alternatives"}

This is not a joke or an ironic jest at a country that has garnered a global reputation for rendering itself an ecological wasteland. This is a very real development that is taking place in a China that is attempting to rapidly transition and stabilize on many fronts.\nWhat started out as a few experimental developments to test new green urban design and technological systems has turned into an all out movement. Eco-cities are now being built across China, from the eastern seaboard to the fringes of Central Asia, from Inner Mongolia to the jungly hinterlands of the south. 80% of all prefectural-level cities are now said to have at least one eco-city project in the works, and it has been estimated that in the near future over 50% of China\u2019s new urban developments will be stamped with labels such as as \u201ceco,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201clow carbon,\u201d or \u201csmart.\u201d In a country that has roughly 650 established cities, the impact of this eco-city building bonanza could be drastic \u2014 even if only a modest portion of them are ever actually completed and populated.\nWe read these stories of China\u2019s forays into the futuristic fringes of urban development, and it seems impressive, but trying to access any information that goes deeper than headlines and bare facts is often a fruitless dive into the black box of the Chinese development sector, which generally goes light in the public outreach department. To really find out what is happening in China\u2019s eco-cities you need to go there \u2014 you need to go out and look at these new developments first hand, talk to the people building them, and the investors and prospective residents who are betting on their future success.\nThe new city of Nanhui, a Chinese eco-city, rising up on reclaimed land.

Over the course of three years, Williams traveled to dozens of eco-cities around China, documenting their progress and figuring out what this movement is really all about.\nBut what, exactly, is an eco-city?\n\u201cThere is no definition of an eco-city, which makes them incredibly easy to invent,\u201d Williams very accurately quipped.\nThere are no formal standards as to what an eco-city is or is not, no certification criteria, no officially mandated seal of approval.

This absurdly priced rangefinder won't appeal to most buyers, but the small percentage of takers can expect top-notch design, superb images, and good low-light performance.\nThe Leica M9-P ($7,995 list, body only) is a beautiful camera with an absurdly high sticker price. Its lack of bells and whistles will confound casual snapshooters, but its an appealing choice for seasoned photographers who fell in love with rangefinder film cameras and want a digital equivalent. If you're looking for a camera that supports autofocus, video recording, and offers a library of zoom lenses, the M9-P is not for you. But if a compact camera with a large image sensor, bright optical viewfinder, and minimalist controls is what you're after, the M9-P may be what you're looking for\u2014the only question is whether you can afford it. This high-end interchangeable lens camera doesn't offer the mass market appeal or flexibility of our Editors' Choice Olympus OM-D E-M5 ($1,299.99, 5 stars), but if you're set on a new digital rangefinder, your choices are all Leica.\nWhy Choose a Rangefinder Camera?\nIf you've never shot with a rangefinder, you must first understand that there are some fundamental differences that set the camera apart from an SLR. When you look through the optical viewfinder of an SLR, you're seeing exactly what the lens sees. This has its advantages\u2014you get an accurate view of your frame and can preview the depth of field of your shot. With a rangefinder, two sets of framelines, which change along with the lens, are displayed in the viewfinder to give you an idea of what your frame will capture, but you'll want to keep shots a bit loose with the intention of cropping, as they aren't entirely accurate. You'll also see a bright rectangle in the middle of the finder with a double image\u2014that's how you focus. As you adjust the focus on the lens barrel, the double image turns into one. Once you've mastered this technique, it's quicker than manually focusing an SLR, but obviously lags behind the best D-SLRs in terms of speed and precision.\nSo, why put up with the convoluted focusing and framing system? For one, the finder is always bright\u2014regardless of whether you're using an f/0.95 lens or an f/4 lens. Depending on how wide your lens is, you'll also be able to see outside of the frame. This is ideal for shooting on the street where pedestrians may wander into a shot unexpectedly, or for tracking action. There's also no finder blackout when you take a photo\u2014so you'll see the exact moment that you're capturing as you hear the shutter click. There aren't a lot"}

The latest one suggests that you will be able to use the watch without ever plugging it in to charge it.\nThe reason for this is that it is said to offer inductive charging. This method of charging up a device was seen in the last year on smartphones such as the Nokia Lumia 920 and the Google Nexus 4. It will be interesting to see such a small device as a smart watch use this technology.\nInductive charging basically works through electromagnetic fields which are produced from one object (in this case it would be a charging unit) and picked up by a second device (the watch).\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. It seems that Apple is looking into other ways of charging its smart watch and for use on other products as well. For example, they are supposedly investigating the feasibility of adding a solar cell under the display of their devices, to allow them to charge using solar power.\nAnother possibility we might see in the future is that of smart devices which use kinetic charging to keep them juiced up.

Still, it\u2019s not the only subject worth discussing. The volume of data collected by the NSA and the associated costs make it the ultimate in Big Data case studies. What can it tell us about data and business? What can it tell us about business risk and the potential benefits and consequences of Big Data investments?\nThe agency\u2019s exact budget is a government secret, but estimates put it around $10 billion per year. Although not all of that is devoted to surveillance, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that something in the ballpark of $5 billion goes to fund NSA data gathering each year. This may not be the clear-cut biggest Big Data application (Google\u2019s revenue was $66 billion last year, for example), but it\u2019s substantial, focused and paid for by the public. We ought to discuss what we\u2019re getting for the money.\nThe budget is not the only cost of any Big Data program. Data gathering and analysis has an impact on public perception and everyday business practices. Do it wrong, and you could run into a lot of costs you never expected. NSA programs have led to costs that the government and public may not have anticipated: correcting functional problems, lost business to US companies, additional security costs to US individuals and businesses seeking to protect private data and the lost influence due to damaged credibility of US government and businesses.\nSpies have always depended on communication surveillance to obtain information. Stealing documents, listening in on conversations and cracking the codes of secret messages are basics of the profession. Electronics have been part of the mix for decades: the British used an elaborate electronic surveillance system to listen in on captured German officers during the 1940s. What\u2019s new is the volume and breadth of information gathered.\nEverybody\u2019s a target. There\u2019s the thing about Big Data. When you collect heaps and heaps of data, you may expect you\u2019ll know all about everybody, but in practice, it may not end up that way.\nWhen I was researching data sources for my book, Data Mining for Dummies, I gathered data on myself from several providers. These sources offer a lot of personal information. They can tell you, for example, that I\u2019m single, a fan of gardening and aerobics, a pet owner, and a regular user of American Express and Discover cards. They can tell you my income and what month my insurance payment is due. What a lot of detail! Think of what you could do with information like that. But you won\u2019t get the results you want, because every bit of that information is wrong.\nWhen the NSA obtains communications data, it has advantages that you do not. It can get communication data directly from the source, and that\u2019s good behavioral data rather than self-reported or other secondary sources, which are consistently of inferior quality. But huge volumes of data come with huge problems. The data management burden is stupendous, and most of that data is irrelevant to the intended purpose. Most people, and most communications, are not involved in government spying, terrorism or other crimes of interest to the NSA.\nBecause Big Data sources usually are not specific to any particular application, they are not necessarily the best data resources for solving any particular problem. A small volume of data, carefully collected for relevance and quality may offer more power.\nSo what do the NSA\u2019s Big Data programs provide us in return for our money?\nBut not everyone shares that view of the results. Some claim the agency is simply overwhelmed with data. When Senator Feinstein told us that terrorist events were stopped and arrests made in the"}

Odds to win the national championship. Maybe also odds to win each regional.\nVSiN has talked a lot in recent months about why you should avoid betting futures. No need to rehash all of that again. In short, for any first time readers, futures usually don\u2019t pay off at true odds, and typically pay off at worse odds (sometimes dramatically worse) than just re-investing in your chosen team on the money line round-by-round through the postseason.\nFor college basketball\u2026re-investing four times in a row to win a regional, or six times in a row to win the national championship is almost certain to out-profit any futures price.\nMany of you are going to bet futures anyway! We understand. Betting is FUN. With that in mind, we want to focus on a mental error too many of you will make when examining odds. You\u2019ll rule out too many possible longshots, which causes you to overrate the chances that favorites will rule the day.\nWhile it\u2019s true that it\u2019s extremely difficult for longshots to win six games in a row (or seven for play-in teams) to cut down the nets and star in \u201cOne Shining Moment,\u201d winning four (or five) in a row to capture a regional is achievable.\nThat\u2019s at least one every year, SIX years in a row!\nThis is important for futures bettors trying to visualize percentage chances for each team to win their region. This isn\u2019t a scenario where the #1 seed wins its section 60% of the time, the #2 seed 30% of the time, the #3 and #4 seeds gobble up the other 10%.\nYou can probably rule out teams #13-16. Everyone else has at least \u201ca chance\u201d to make it. Some teams you were giving 0% are probably in the 1-5% range each. Talented \u201clive floaters\u201d who were mis-seeded are probably even higher. The past six seasons, 29% of regionals were won by teams seeded #7 or worse.\nCasual bettors instinctively look for ways to bet highly ranked programs. Doing so game-to-game can seem scary because the point spreads are too high until later rounds. It\u2019s easy to make the mistake of assuming that betting futures is a better way to go.\nProbabilities are messy. Shooting variance can shock a super-team (they\u2019re cold for a game, or an opponent can\u2019t miss). An off-the-radar surprise is more likely than you realize."}

{"idx": "10120", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Too Many Initiatives ... Too Little Time?\nAt the same time the adults are battling at the top over the right changes, the students walk into school every single day hoping to be engaged.\nUnfortunately, some schools seem too busy to take these right drivers into consideration because they continue to be under intense pressure to change...for a variety of reasons. State education departments, as well as the U.S. Department of Education, have their own ideas of how all schools should change. That clearly has some good and bad points when we take into account that not all schools are the same and lack the same resources. Yes, this is not new news.\nWhen we go down to the district level, there are school district leaders who have their ideas about how their whole district should change. New years bring in new initiatives. Sometimes it does not necessarily come at the beginning of each new year; sometimes it comes after a new idea comes across their desk that they believe would be beneficial for their whole district.\nTo make matters more complicated, building leaders have their agendas about how their buildings need to change. It may be another new leader, or based on the collective thoughts of their whole staff and school community. Change is something building and district leaders talk (and read) a great deal about.\nGoing a little further, many teachers have their own ideas about what changes they want to make in their classroom practices. Perhaps it came after a summer of reflection or a grade level planning meeting. Maybe they found a new resource through social media or read a great book that has inspired them. We never know when we will read something that can change our mindset.\nAll of these changes collide, and they do not always coincide with one another. Sure, leaders and teachers should be moving in the same direction, but it doesn't always happen that way.\nWhen the changes are all occurring at the same time, many educators feel that they cannot keep up. They go with the changes from the top because those are the ones that come with more pressure, and are often tied to funding. When this happens, teachers feel the need to let go of the changes they want to make because there is only so much time in the day.\nOver the past few years schools have seen an increase in the need to collect data, which many schools definitely do. The problem is that they collect so much data that they do not know what to do with it, and often do not have the time to properly reflect on the data that they collected.\nThere are so many ways that schools are being asked to change. Some of the changes are new, while others are the same topics that schools have been trying to address for decades. Three that come to mind are literacy practices, anti-bullying laws and technology.\nReading is a constant focus for schools. At the elementary level, improving literacy practices is always the center of the conversation where data is concerned. How well are students reading, are they increasing their Lexile levels, and what methods work best. Students are being progress monitored left and right, and the pressure to get all students to read on grade level by 3rd grade has created this intense pressure to intervene at every word when a child is reading. It's sucking the fun out of reading.\nIn Reading Moves: What Not to Do (Educational Leadership. 2014), Richard Allington focused on some of the ways we do a disservice to reading, and it's a byproduct of the era of accountability we live in, but it happened all too often before accountability ever entered into our lives.

{"idx": "10128", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Stanford professor of applied physics Peter Sturrock and other researchers released a paper this past month proposing a new system to detect neutrinos by monitoring radioactive decay rates. This system, if proven effective, would not only reduce the cost of detecting neutrinos from millions of dollars to thousands, but also deepen our understanding of elementary particle physics.\nPurdue professor of physics and astronomy Ephraim Fischbach and astrophysicist Jeffrey Scargle of NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center also collaborated on the paper.\nNeutrinos, which are abundant, nearly massless elementary particles, are released as a byproduct of energy production in the sun\u2019s deep interior. Not only can studying neutrinos help elucidate the behavior of the sun\u2019s currently impenetrable interior, but studying the patterns of neutrino emission might possibly help to predict solar storms, which are intense bursts of radiation from the sun. These flares can cause damage and operational anomalies in man-made electronics.\nDespite their abundance, however, neutrinos rarely interact with other particles, making them incredibly difficult to detect. Current methods are inefficient and involve building complicated, expensive detectors. One such detector, Super-Kamiokande, costs $100 million and requires 13 million gallons of ultra-pure water.\nAlthough the new system of detecting neutrinos proposed by the paper has broad applications to many fields in physics and solar science, the system started with a problem in a completely different field. Fischbach was working on a difficult integral problem when he developed a new test for randomness.\nFischbach then applied this test to study nuclear decay, only to discover that nuclear decay was not random, but rather influenced by unknown signals.\nWith Sturrock and Scargle on board, the team was then able to analyze nuclear decay data and study what was causing this non-random variation. They found that these unknown signals seemed to correspond with the data from Super-Kamiokande and other neutrino detection facilities.\nHowever, the team must compile more evidence before they can determine for sure that the signals they are seeing correspond to interacting neutrinos.\nIf the team can prove that these variations of decay rate are due to neutrinos, it is likely to change a lot about the way people think of physics.\nIf these decay rate variations cannot be attributed to neutrinos, the discovery of non-stochastic, non-constant decay rates still raises the question of what forces are causing the variations."}

We also tallied Overall Vote-getters and solicited entries for the Most Coveted title - i.e., which director our respondents most wanted to work with. Admittedly, categories can be a nightmare. Directors have an understandable aversion to being typecast, and many of the people we polled also took issue with having to box up their brethren. Some ignored our survey format and simply sent us lists of their faves. But what turned up in the results should at least partially quell the fears of anyone who's loath to be pigeonholed. Many of the directors were applauded not just for single but for multiple categories. The venerable Spike Jonze scored in a whopping five, and also made the list of overall top scorers. Kinka Usher, notable for his high-testosterone Mountain Dew work, and the fly-minded Microsoft XP campaign, gained recognition in both the Action and Performance genres. The directors profiled in the following pages also have a lot to say on the subject of skills-sorting. Sam Bayer wryly notes that it was his success with \"intimate portraits\" that opened the door to all the action work he's now known for. Others, like tabletop star Irv Blitz, make clear that success often means being expansive and open-minded in the way one approaches what in lesser hands could be nothing more than an obscure tech-intensive niche. At any rate, we salute you all. The lists, it must be noted, are presented in alphabetical order. We're not playing favorites with the favorites. Thanks to everyone who participated, and here's hoping we see you all again in 2002."}

That referred to the wait for the Kansas City Royals to make the playoffs, something that hadn't happened in 29 years. And a lot of fans say that last night was worth the wait, worth waiting nearly three decades for, and last night waiting 12 innings for.\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Now looking for a two-out hit, past third, into left field. The Kansas City Royals are walking off into the ALDS.\nSIEGEL: That's the game-winning hit broadcast last night on TBS. The Royals beat Oakland and they advanced to the American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels. Last night's win is a tough act to beat as the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants play the National League wild card game, another elimination game. And joining me is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Hi, Tom.\nTOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Robert.\nSIEGEL: Baseball introduced the wild card games a couple of years ago to add more teams to the playoff mix and to generate some excitement with these do or die situations. It certainly lived up to that last night.\nGOLDMAN: Man, oh, man. Four hours and 45 minutes, Robert. I know baseball wants to hurry up games but this one was worth every second. You know, it had swings of fortune. It had dramatic comebacks. It had nerves of steel performance. How about the winning hit that we just heard by Kansas City catcher Salvador Perez, who'd been terrible at the plate, going 0-for-5 until his single in the bottom of the 12th inning? And then, of course, the move by Kansas City manager Ned Yost in the sixth inning that sure seemed like a major mistake. He took out the starting pitcher, James Shields, with a one run lead, replaced him with a 23-year-old Yordano Ventura, normally a starting pitcher who wasn't used to coming in as a reliever. He almost immediately gave up a home run. The inning ended with Oakland ahead by four and looking very much like they were going to win.\nSIEGEL: Well, they didn't. And for the team that loses the wild card game, that's especially tough to take. It's like, you were in the postseason but not really in the postseason.\nGOLDMAN: Yeah, exactly. I mean, some critics call it a coin flip game because a team can have an off night, or there can be one bad hop or a blown call and the team is out of the playoffs. And, you know, the ultimate message for the losing team, like the Oakland A's, is win your division, guys. That's the only way to avoid this kind of game. And in Oakland's case, you could say they lost this weeks, even months, before when they followed a great first half of the season with a terrible second half. They were cruising toward a division title and then had to win their final game of the regular season just to make this wild card game.\nSI"}

She used to absolutely love 'Forget You' by Cee Lo until I played it so many times. I played it five times a day, and then I made it my ring tone.

Go show and tell your neighbors what it is to be made in the image of God.\u2019 That\u2019s what we do here as well \u2013 come and eat at this table, and become what you eat, and then share yourself, your Word of God-self and flesh of God-self with a very hungry world.\nYet it is not only God in human flesh who images the Holy One. All parts of God\u2019s creation must reflect their maker in some way. The riotous diversity of the flowers of the field, the creatures of the sea \u2013 even Leviathan, whom God has made \u201cfor the sport of it\u201d according to the psalmist \u2013 and the sparrows that Jesus invokes in the gospel today \u2013 their creator cares for them and intends that each one flourish.\nThat is part of the challenging message of today\u2019s gospel: you will be hated because of what you teach \u2013 watch out if you advocate for justice for all the world\u2019s people and the other parts of creation! But don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and tell out what you know, for your soul will find life in doing that. Even in the face of danger, know that God cares for each one of us in ways beyond our knowing, even more than the evidence we see in the birds of the air and the flowers of the field.\nAthanasius had a predecessor in the faith named Irenaeus who famously remarked that the glory of God is a human being fully alive. That\u2019s what Athanasius also meant in saying that our vocation was becoming divine. Fully alive human beings know themselves made in the image of God, created as brother to the sun and sister to the moon, friend to the deer, and ant, and sparrow, as well as the enfolding blanket of atmosphere and ocean. We are one family, related through the one who created us to reflect the divine glory in fully-aliveness. There is no room in that for misusing our brothers and sisters, human or otherwise. There is abundant hope for all, given the image we reflect, and the ever-creative One in whom we live and move and have our being.\nAthanasius stood firm in the face of those who would deny God\u2019s presence in human flesh. We must do the same in the face of those who would destroy God\u2019s reflection in creation."}

Even when Acadiana regained the lead with less than two minutes remaining, the point-after attempt was blocked. Then Acadiana dropped two potential game-sealing interceptions on a drive that ended in a game-winning field goal, handing the Rams their first loss of the season.\nBut just as minor details can be the difference in stunning defeats, it can be the catalyst behind rousing victories.\nIn Friday\u2019s 35-10 Homecoming win against previously-unbeaten Sam Houston, Acadiana learned from its mistakes, mastering small facets of the game.\nThe Rams\u2019 defense forced three turnovers and scored off of all three. Kicker Landon Guidry converted all five of his extra points. New punter Latrell Charles consistently flipped the field, punting four times for 139 yards \u2014 an average of 34.8 yards. Acadiana also protected the ball, recovering both of its fumbles.\nIt was impressive bounce-back effort by a young team that returned only seven starters from last year\u2019s semifinal team, under a first-year coach. With the win, Acadiana (6-1, 3-1) now repositions itself to win District 3-5A, needing to run the table and hope the Spartans (4-3, 3-1) stumble at least once more.\n\u201cIt was a big game because it was the first time this young team faced some adversity after a football game,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cEspecially the way we lost against Comeaux, blowing a 24-point lead and them kicking a field goal on the last play of the game. So it was a big for us.\nWhen the Rams avoid the self-inflicted wounds, it allows them to do what they do best. Led by 150 yards and three touchdowns from Larryll Greene, including a 65-yard scoring jaunt on the third play of the third quarter, the Veer Machine racked up 324 rushing yards. Lucky Brooks produced 91 yards and touchdown, and Dillan Monette, somewhat limited by injury, added a 3-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.\nAcadiana possessed the ball for 31 minutes and 59 seconds.\nBut the offense owes plenty to an opportunistic Acadiana defense. The Rams needed to go only 51, 23 and 4 yards after each takeaway.\nSam Houston running back Gerron Duhon, a Yale commitment, left the game with an injury on the second play from scrimmage and didn\u2019t return. Aside from a 38-yard field goal by Davis Dow \u2014 a touchdown pass was wiped out by a holding penalty earlier in the drive \u2014 the Broncos (6-1, 3-1) failed to establish any offensive rhythm until late in the fourth quarter.\nSam Houston, averaging 38 points per game entering the contest, finished with just 136 yards of offense and converted on only one of its nine third-down attempts.\nThen when you throw in Acad"}

Hardy and easy to grow, Its tuberous roots were an important food source before the popularization of potatoes. Jerusalem artichokes are high in iron and provide other potential health benefits.\nBread made with Jerusalem artichoke contains more fiber and prebiotic content than conventional bread, according to a study published in the June 2002 \"Nahrung.\" Researchers used Jerusalem artichoke powder in place of a portion of wheat or rye flour and measured content of fructan, a fructose-derived molecule, also known as inulin, that acts as a food source for probiotic bacteria and adds bulk to the digestive tract. The resulting product received high ratings for taste and texture. Jerusalem artichoke showed similar fiber-enhancing benefits to a commercial product derived from chicory.\nInsulin sensitivity -- the ability of cells to respond appropriately to insulin -- improved in a study published in the December 2012 \"Nutrition and Metabolism.\" Diabetic animals that ate diets supplemented with 5 percent Jerusalem artichoke for eight weeks showed improved glucose tolerance, the ability to maintain healthy blood sugar levels and prevent post-meal spikes in blood sugar, as well as improved insulin secretion. When Jerusalem artichoke was combined with fermented soybean paste, the combination, at 5 percent of the diet, showed an additive effect that was better than Jerusalem artichoke by itself. Additionally, Jerusalem artichoke improved the function of insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas.\nFruit and vegetable juices combined with Jerusalem artichoke extract may help beneficial bacteria flourish in your digestive tract, according to a study published in the July 2010 \"British Journal of Nutrition.\" Participants drank shot-sized portions of the juice combinations, including pear, carrot, plum, beetroot and sea buckthorn, to which 5 grams of Jerusalem artichoke inulin were added. Results showed significantly higher levels of several important probiotic bacteria, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species. No changes in bowel habits, but a mild increase in gasiness was reported as a side effect of the Jerusalem artichoke supplementation.\nWith a lighter taste, somewhat reminiscent of water chestnut, and a texture similar to potatoes and other starchy root vegetables, Jerusalem artichoke offers a versatile, healthy alternative to conventional fare. Jerusalem artichoke tubers can be boiled, mashed or pureed in soups, stews or side dishes and can be substituted for potatoes in most recipes.

Where other '90s survivors have settled into roles as nascent elder statesmen (Pearl Jam) or rigorous outsiders (Radiohead), Beck walks a pocked and mysterious path.\nSince busting out of the underground 14 years ago with the slacker anthem \"Loser,\" he's mastered postmodern pastiche, proved a sure-handed surrealist, tripped through tropicalia, channeled a funk-fried party maven, and accessed his inner troubadour. He alternates dazzling-mess albums and focused meditations the way other people change shirts.\nAlong the way, Beck's bottomless stores of hipster irony and wacked-out humor have been largely replaced by dark memory and bleak anticipation. His last album, 2006's \"The Information,\" was a glum, if artful, collection of tech-age fever dreams. \"Modern Guilt,\" as the title of Beck's new album suggests, takes its predecessor's sounds and concerns into the realm of the emotions, douses them with a shimmering dollop of '60s vibes, and voila: another great Beck record.\nOut today, \"Modern Guilt\" was co-produced by Brian \"Danger Mouse\" Burton, half of Gnarls Barkley, and the collaboration makes all kinds of sense. Both are obsessed with the hybrid possibilities of modern technology and classic songcraft - Beck's pioneering patchworks surely paved the way for Gnarls Barkley's tricked-out psychedelic soul - and for Beck's eighth album, the pair has constructed a dazzling set of collisions that are as heady as they are humane.\nThe title track is a diseased ditty, jaunty of step and desperate of message. \"Misapprehension is turning into convention/ Don't know what I've done, but I feel ashamed,\" Beck sings over fuzzy beats and saloon-style piano. His anxiety is all-purpose: environmental (\"Gamma Ray\" and \"Chemtrails\"), existential (\"Soul of a Man,\" \"Volcano\"), and social (\"Orphans,\" \"Youthless\"). Sonic touchstones are equally pointed and vast, from heavy metal and the Beatles to shoegaze and Kraftwerk.\nIn signature form, Beck fashions a fantastical escape on \"Replica,\" an unmoored song that careens headlong into the ether on a rush of skittering beats, ethereal keyboards, and a massive pile-up of basses and marimbas. \"Make a perfect replica of your life,\" he sings above the din. \"Cut the paper with exacto knife/ Tape it up/ Tape it up/ Against the howling wind/ I'm so tired I don't know where to begin.\"\nWhile the artist and producer handle most of the instruments, and Danger Mouse's pawprints are nearly everywhere, the best song on the album - lo and behold the first single - is beat-less and Mouse-less. Masterfully cobbled by familiar Beck cohorts Jason Falkner, Joey Waronker, and Greg Kurstin, \"Chemtrails\" is actually far too eerie and epic to fly as a single, but it does rank among Beck's most beautiful recordings.

Just as the solar system did not all form in one day.\nPoints well taken. Indeed, there are now plenty of organizations in which SOA is showing signs of taking hold as a transformative force, and benefits may be seen in relatively short order.\nThe bottom line is that organizations that really need SOA the most to reform and reshape their processes are the ones least likely to adopt SOA. For most of these organizations, service-orientation will be spotty, uneven, without purpose, and often without the full support of the enterprise -- or perhaps no support at all. There will be plenty of SOA proponents forced to go it alone, building success one process at a time. Guerrilla tactics may be the only way forward here.\nMiko equates such localized efforts to the formation of individual planets, that exist within their own orbits until they eventually find ways to link to other planets within the same solar system. Or, as he puts it, \"enterprise software has a planetary system\u2013the guys from IT operations act like they are from another planet! The developers are from planet Koozbane... it\u2019s not just the different branches of IT that form planets, the assortments of business units and even the central IT function are all different planets.... This may not be Enterprise (intergalactic) SOA, but at the very least Lifecycle SOA. Lets walk before we can run.\"\nAnother point Jeff made got me to thinking as well. As he put it, SOA implementations he has seen and helped develop are guided by a compelling vision. \"Companies that I work with who take the time to think about what SOA means to them. They plan their community... And once they've figured out how to build a community they go do it. They don't do it for the entire enterprise all at once - that isn't what 'enterprise SOA' means. Instead, they partition their enterprise into a set of communities and attack them, often in parallel.\"\nBut right now, as countless surveys keep telling us, SOA still mainly resides within IT. IT may be a catalyst for organizational change, but shouldn't be expected to carry the torch of overall business transformation. The entire enterprise needs to be active in this effort.\nAs SOA helps reconstituted business succeed in the marketplace, market forces will compel the masses of companies with less-inspired management to follow suit."}

{"idx": "10171", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the first two parts of our \"Future of Driving\" series, we examined the technology that exists today and explored how the world could change when self-driving technologies become widely available. The previous installment focused on the potential benefits of self-driving technologies, and so it offered an optimistic vision of where self-driving could take us. This, our final installment, brings things back down to earth by looking at the politics of self-driving cars and considering some of the many ways things could go awry. Excessive tort liability and government regulation could keep viable self-driving technologies off the road. Customers could lose control over their own vehicles to automakers seeking DMCA-like anti-circumvention laws. Most ominously, the government is likely to seek a \"back door\" that gives them the power to seize control of self-driving vehicles.\nSelf-driving cars will be at the center of a lot of political controversies during the 21st century. Read on for a sneak preview.\nThe first question that will confront policymakers is what, if anything, governments can or should do to hasten the introduction of self-driving technologies. One advocate for a greater government role is Brad Templeton, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has recently become an evangelist for self-driving technologies. Templeton draws a parallel to John F. Kennedy's famous speech where he announced the Apollo project to send a man to the moon. Templeton believes that the necessary computing power and sensing hardware will be ready by the end of the next decade, and he tells Ars that government support could accelerate the necessary software breakthroughs and allow the introduction of viable self-driving products by 2020. He suggests that the next president could make the acceleration of self-driving technologies a focus of a state of the union address early in his term.\nTempleton is quick to stress that the Apollo analogy shouldn't be taken too literally. \"Apollo was a mission to send two men to walk on the moon,\" Templeton tells Ars. That's a very different problem than designing a technology that will be usable by and affordable to tens of millions of ordinary customers. Rather than proposing a single, monolithic government research project akin to the Apollo and Manhattan projects, Templeton envisions the next president publicizing the technology, supporting subsidies for self-driving research, and clearing away red tape to ensure that vehicles can be introduced promptly once they're ready. He argues that DARPA offers a promising model: fund multiple small, independent teams that are working on hard technical problems, and see what they come up with.\nOther scholars are more skeptical of an active government role in promoting self-driving technologies. Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who studies energy issues, notes that American presidents have a long history of touting next-generation automotive technologies, and most of them haven't panned out. Jimmy Carter, for example, was convinced that conventional cars powered by synthetic oil was the future of automation. The early 1990s saw a hot debate in Congress among advocates of ethanol, methanol, and other oil substitutes. Also in the 1990s, California required the increased sale of zero-emission vehicles such as electric or hydrogen-fueled cars within ten years, a goal that was never achieved. Most recently, the Bush administration has pushed a number of alternative automotive technologies, including hydrogen-powered vehicles, cars powered by switchgrass, and plug-in hybrids.

Deep shady depressions, dense old forests or places close to water for example are always considerably cooler than their surroundings.\n\u201cKnowing where cold climate refugia are in the landscape means we can protect these cold spots and help cold-adapted species to survive a warmer climate. Knowing how colder microclimates are generated means we could even create colder spots by wisely managing our forests\u201d, said Caroline Greiser, PhD student at Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences.\nThe scientists found out that summer maximum temperatures at the forest floor can differ more than 10\u00b0C over only 100 meters.\n\u201cWe also found out that the forest plays a dominant role in controlling warm near-ground temperatures in the summer, more than local topography.

As a response, NFL teams scrambled to fill their rosters with \u201creplacement players,\u201d individuals who had some experience with college or professional football, but who weren\u2019t part of NFL rosters that year. Replacement games \u2013 which lasted three weeks - were deeply unpopular with fans. The replacement players themselves became a footnote in sports history.\nIt turns out these players may actually play a critical role in football today - by helping us understand how playing in the NFL affects long-term health.\nThere is considerable interest in understanding how professional football affects health. The main concern is that injuries to the brain may shorten the life of NFL players. Lifestyle choices, such as substance use (either during or after a player\u2019s career), and listlessness and loss of purpose after early retirement are other factors that may also raise the risk of early death.\nBut finding an answer is difficult. The key issue is that NFL players represent some of the best, most uniquely trained professional athletes in the world, which means that any comparison of health outcomes needs to be based on a similarly athletic group of individuals who, for some reason, did not play professionally.\nPrevious studies have compared NFL players to men of similar age and race drawn from the general population \u2013 regular people like us. These studies find that NFL players have a much lower risk of death. While comparing NFL players to the general population might look good on the surface, the two groups are actually nothing alike. To make an NFL roster, players have to be in incredible shape. NFL players also make more money than most and have access to the very best health care while they are playing, which can improve health, too.\nThis is where the replacement players come in. Unlike members of the general population, replacement players often had prior experience playing football and maybe even similar training, but their professional experience was typically limited to just the strike games. Replacement players are much more like NFL players than the rest of us - but without the prolonged exposure to the game. This makes them an ideal comparison group for NFL players.\nIn our recent study, published in JAMA, we compared the life expectancies of professional NFL players who debuted between 1982 and 1992 to the life expectancies of replacement players from the 1987 strike.\nWe found that the risk of death in any given year after retirement was 38 percent higher among NFL players. These results are only suggestive, however, because the overall death rate was low. By the end of our study (December 2016), the players were on average only 52 years old and only a small proportion (4.2 percent of replacement players and 4.9 percent of NFL players) had died. These low rates of death make our estimates imprecise. Even though we can\u2019t be truly certain that the risk of death was higher among NFL players, our estimates do allow us to rule out the possibility that NFL players have substantively lower risk of death than replacement players \u2013 which is what studies comparing NFL players to men in the general population have found.\nWe also looked at causes of death. Both NFL and replacement players were most likely to die from heart disease. But there was a greater proportion of deaths from traffic accidents, unintentional harm (typically accidental overdoses from prescriptions drugs or drugs of abuse), and neurological diseases \u2013 like ALS \u2013 among NFL players. The higher risk of death from neurological disease among NFL players has been found in other research, as well.\nComparing measures of career NFL player and replacement player health over time will help increase statistical precision. Moreover, studies that go beyond just looking at life expectancy, by comparing measures of"}

An era of globalisation and the advance of artificial intelligence across the West makes it difficult to defend the centuries old independence of Scots Law and even the traditional role of the Scottish solicitor. Many of their proposals though seem out of time.\nThe frustration of the Law Society of Scotland in their submission to the Scottish Government\u2019s review of legal regulation is palpable and to an extent justified. Large international law firms with no organic link to Scotland have set up here in the last few years. Mainly based in England, the Law Society has no jurisdiction over them. Yet calling for legislation to allow the Law Society power to regulate cross border firms seems to be wishful thinking, and probably beyond the Scottish Parliament\u2019s powers, as there are strict geographical limits over where Scottish legislation can apply.\nTrying to police the use of the word \u201clawyer\u201d again seems unfeasible. In truth, lawyer has always been a generic description of people working within the legal system with no more meaning than that. The more specific jobs of solicitor, advocate or even judge are regulated and cannot be used in an ad hoc fashion.\nThe control of language in this way is also borne of frustration as many companies now claim to proffer \u201clegal advice\u201d without employing solicitors qualified in Scots Law. It is doubtful whether or not allowing them to call themselves \u201clawyers\u201d would prevent this phenomenon.\nOne of the drivers in April 2017 for this review were rumblings around the complaints system against Scottish legal professionals. For members of the public, the system was labyrinthine. For solicitors and advocates, the 12.5% increase in fees by the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission (SLCC) announced last year was a step too far.\nThe SLCC was actually created in 2008 as new approach to legal regulation. It replaced the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman which was viewed as remote from the public and too close to the profession. A return to such a model would be unthinkable."}

He has been charged with one count of conspiracy computer hacking, according to a Department of Justice indictment.\nThe DoJ complaint alleges Pingan was a malware broker in the People's Republic of China and from April 2011 until January 2014 transmitted malware code that was used in attacks against multiple organizations.\nAccording to the DoJ complaint, Pingan used the Sakula malware to compromise networks. The Sakula malware has previously been linked to the Anthem breach in 2015 as well as the breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\nIBM has announced a new data protection software package for virtual machines that it claims can be set up in as little as one hour.\nIBM Spectrum Protect Plus, which will be made available in the fourth quarter of this year, will offer two different deployment options, either as stand-alone software installed into virtualized environments or as an integrated function with IBM's Spectrum Protect software, which can be used by large enterprise clients with diverse data protection and availability requirements.\nIn addition, Spectrum Protect's hybrid cloud capabilities enable data movement from on-premises back-end storage to public or private clouds. Spectrum Protect Plus also provides data availability by using snapshots for rapid backup, recovery and data management.\nApple will be including 4K video capabilities in its upcoming fifth-generation Apple TV set-top box when it is announced in September alongside the company's 10th anniversary iPhones and new Apple Watch models.\nThe upgraded Apple TV product will also be able to stream live TV content, including news and sports, according to an Aug. 24 story by Bloomberg based on details from unnamed sources who are familiar with the company's plans.\nThe upcoming Apple TV set-top box will have a \"renewed focus on the living room\" to bring new capabilities to users through a faster processor that can handle 4K video requirements.\nVideo resolution in 4K is twice that of 1080p high-definition video, providing improved video quality.

Moore, the CEO and co-founder of RJMetrics, a on-demand database analytics and business intelligence startup that helps online businesses measure, manage, and monetize better. He was previously a venture capital analyst and currently serves as an advisor to several New York startups. Robert blogs at The Metric System and can be followed on Twitter at @RJMetrics.\nA few weeks ago, my former employer led a $100 million investment into Twitter and I must admit that I was quite jealous of my former colleagues. Chances are they got the opportunity to do some very cool analytics on Twitter's data.\nTwitter's user growth is no longer accelerating. The rate of new user acquisition has plateaued at around 8 million per month.\nOver 14% of users don't have a single follower, and over 75% of users have 10 or fewer followers.\n38% of users have never sent a single tweet, and over 75% of users have sent fewer than 10 tweets.\n1 in 4 registered users tweets in any given month.\nOnce a user has tweeted once, there is a 65% chance that they will tweet again. After that second tweet, however, the chance of a third tweet goes up to 81%.\nIf someone is still tweeting in their second week as a user, it is extremely likely that they will remain on Twitter as a long-term user.\nUsers who joined in more recent months are less likely to stop using the service and more likely to tweet more often than users from the past.\nRead on for some detailed charts a deeper dive into the data.\nIn the end, our sample size consisted of about 85,000 users and just over 3 Million tweets. By piecing all of these things together and pulling the data into the RJMetrics Dashboard, I was able to chart loads of information about Twitter's user base and user behavior. I've looked around, and this appears to be the largest public analysis of Twitter's user base online. Enjoy!\nHockey, anyone? As of September 1st, the actual number of live Twitter accounts was just above 50 million.\nWhen we look at the distribution of tweets by user, we see a very surprising trend: over 75% of all Twitter users have tweeted fewer than ten times.\nBefore moving onto analyses at the tweet level, it's important to note that some of the users we identified have \"protected\" their tweets, meaning we were able to see how many followers they had and how many times they had tweeted, but were unable to download specific tweets (and, more importantly, tweet times).\nAnother limitation of the API is that it can only return the 3,200 most recent tweets for any given user. This is obviously not a big deal for most users, but there are some users out there who have passed that mark. Our sample data set showed that less than 0.02% of Twitter users have sent more than 3,200 tweets. These users will have incomplete data sets in our study, but the population is so small that they should not have any meaningful impact on our conclusions.\nTwitterriffic has clearly seen better days, and text messages (txt) have been declining as a channel, as well. Meanwhile, TweetDeck appears to be aggressively gobbling up market share.\nSince we know the timestamp of every tweet in our sample data set, we can study the time between tweets and the recency of tweets from the userbase."}

The United States has squandered over $1 trillion on the war. Over 2,000 US soldiers have lost their lives, with 20,000 wounded. The war goes on with no plan for victory.\nThe current chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, admitted that the war is a \u201cstalemate.\u201d Yet, when Donald Trump tweeted that he was going to begin pulling troops out of Afghanistan, the foreign-policy establishment howled in disapproval. Richard Haass, a vicar of that establishment, rushed to defend the current course in a recent op-ed.\nHis defense of endless war in Afghanistan is a classic example of the strategic lunacy of the conventional wisdom in the foreign-policy establishment. Haass admits that the situation in Afghanistan is a \u201cslowly deteriorating stalemate,\u201d with \u201cno military victory\u201d possible. He thinks negotiations are unlikely to succeed, simply because the Taliban sensibly believes it can outlast the United States\u2014after all, they live there.\nIn Haass\u2019s eyes, America gains in \u201ccredibility\u201d by continuing a war that it cannot win. Our allies will certainly be reassured, as they witness us wasting lives and treasure propping up a kleptocratic regime whose people are constantly exposed to terror and whose economy is dependent on the drug trade.\nHaass also assumes we can afford to fight a low-level war forever\u2014at the cost of $50 billion or so a year\u2014without anything changing. In fact, our endless and failed interventions have, understandably, soured Americans on global adventure.\nThe real credibility gap is between the foreign-policy establishment and the growing number of Americans who have little appetite for their global meddling. Not surprisingly, when Trump was willing to say the unspeakable in public\u2014that America\u2019s foreign policy \u201cis a complete and total disaster\u201d\u2014he found a ready audience.\nAs a \u201creluctant sheriff,\u201d the United States is now using drones to bomb seven countries, while fighting in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan; supporting a surrogate genocidal war in Yemen; and dispatching special forces to 147 countries, which is about three-quarters of the the world. Meanwhile, our infrastructure is crumbling, our children are forced into debt to get the education we say they need, and real and present national security threats\u2014like catastrophic climate change\u2014are denied or ignored. The World Bank estimates that we have a $4 trillion infrastructure-investment gap\u2014and that does not include the cost of meeting the challenge of catastrophic climate change.\nThis isn\u2019t rocket science. The argument that continuing an endless war without victory makes sense can only be sustained by an insular and unaccountable elite out of touch with the realities around them. Yet Haass accurately echoes the conventional wisdom of Washington\u2019s bipartisan foreign-policy establishment\u2014and of its political class.\nConsider, Mitch McConnell chose not to challenge Trump when he embraced white nationalists, fought to throw millions off of health insurance, slandered America\u2019s intelligence agencies, or shut down the government over his idiotic wall. Yet, when Trump announced he would begin removing troops from Afghanistan, McConnell leapt into the fray. In a direct rebuke to Trump, he introduced a resolution denouncing \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan. \u201c[W]hile it is tempting to retreat to the comfort and security"}

Later, the passenger was said to be in stable condition. Leaving the medically ill passenger at the Warsaw Airport where he was undergoing emergency treatment, the said flight left for London. It stayed in Warsaw for over an hour.\nAccording to details, a PIA flight PK-785 left for Heathrow Airport London from Benazir Bhutto International Airport (BBIA) Islamabad at 11:00am (Pakistan's time) on Wednesday and was scheduled to land in London at 03:00pm.\nSoon after the flight took off, a British-Pakistani national passenger identified as Raja Nazir, 57, started feeling pain in the chest. Gradually, his condition worsened. Two heart specialists boarding the same flight provided him initial treatment while observing that the passenger might have suffered a heart stroke. This prompted the PIA authorities to ask the Warsaw aviation officials for an emergency landing at the Warsaw Chopin Airport. The flight was allowed to land at the said airport where a team of doctors found out that Nazir actually had a heart stroke and needed immediate treatment.\nConfirming the incident, the PIA Spokesperson Mashhood Tajwar said that the flight had an emergency landing out of humanitarian grounds. \"It was a life-threatening situation for the passenger whose heart malfunctioned during the flight. He could have faced any untoward situation had the emergency treatment not been provided. For the required medical support to the patient, the flight had to be landed at the Warsaw Airport,\" he told this correspondent.\nThe PIA authorities, Tajwar said, were in contact with the Warsaw Airport management regarding the treatment of the passenger. \"It was not advisable for the patient to travel in such a serious condition which is why he has been left there for treatment.\"\nAccording to Pakistani time, the said flight reached London at 5:30pm, the spokesperson informed.\nSpeaking to this newspaper from Warsaw, Spokesmen Warsaw Chopin Airport Przemyslaw Przybylski said that the patient was in stable condition after getting the emergency treatment. \"He is feeling better now.

When the big image of the product appears on screen, we want the time shown to be close to the actual time on the audience\u2019s watches. But we know we won\u2019t hit 40 minutes exactly\u2026for the iPhone, we made it 42 minutes. It turned out we were pretty accurate with that estimate, so for the iPad, we made it 41 minutes. And there you are \u2013 the secret of the magic time.\nMystery solved! What revealing proof of Apple\u2019s perfectionism! Betcha that Microsoft doesn\u2019t sweat details like that!\nExcept\u2026it\u2019s not nearly that simple. In order to actually figure this stuff out, you need to revisit the video of Apple\u2019s keynotes, track when the \u201cbig reveals\u201d occur, and take note of the time as indicated in the images shown onstage.\nSo I did. And I found that the iPhone 3GS was announced at approximately 11:45am at last year\u2019s WWDC. And the iPad was unveiled at roughly 10:10am at an event in January. In neither case did the time shown in the \u201cbig reveal\u201d image have anything to do with the current time in San Francisco, where both products debuted.\nJust to complicate matters: The \u201cbig reveal\u201d image of the iPhone 3GS showed the time as 9:41am, the same one indicated by the iPad\u2013I\u2019m not sure where the 9:42am shown in current stock images of the iPhone 3GS came from.\nJobs was forty minutes into the keynote, which had been scheduled to begin at 9am\u2013which fits Forstall\u2019s \u201cbig reveal\u201d theory exactly. But the keynote had gotten off to an unusually slow start, and didn\u2019t get underway until 9:14 or so. So Jobs stood onstage at 9:54am with a picture of an iPhone that seemed to be keeping really bad time.\nIn other words, it would seem that Apple tried for obsessive perfectionism, but it didn\u2019t quite work out.\n4) For decades, most watch ads have shown watches that indicate the time as 10:10 or thereabouts (sometimes a couple of minutes earlier, sometimes a couple of minutes later). There\u2019s no conspiracy\u2013it\u2019s just that it looks attractive, and artfully places the hands so that they don\u2019t interfere with the manufacturer\u2019s logo. But the iPad\u2019s big reveal in January did happen at 10:10am\u2013maybe that\u2019s a conspiracy!\nI would be willing to bet that the 9:41 time was simply kept because the Illustrator file that was used to create the \u201cvision\u201d image for each new product was based on the previous one. Slim the edges, stretch it out, rework the background and icons, and bam! You\u2019ve got an iPad from an iPhone! That\u2019s my theory, anyway.\nWhat more can I say? Apple is simply amazing!

And that's just the beginning. Specifically, Palm OS 4.0 includes support for the Universal Connector communications and synchronization interface, the 33-MHz Motorola DragonBall VZ CPU, MultiMediaCard and Secure Digital Expansion slots, and 16-bit, 64K color displays (found on the Palm m505). Version 4.0 also includes Palm Desktop software enhancements to boost productivity with any compatible PDA.\nPalm places an emphasis on security in version 4.0. You can protect your data from prying eyes by setting a security password as well as a hint to remind you. If you forget your password, you can guess an infinite number of times without being locked out or forced to perform a hard reset and lose all of your data. Also, in addition to a manual lock Menu button, you can program your PDA to lock automatically when turned off, either after a set time lapse of inactivity or at a specified time.\nAlarm functions are also enhanced. The Date Book, Clock, and Note Pad applications now support LED and vibrating alarms for those occasions when you need silent alerts. Whenever an alarm goes off, a Reminder screen displays a list of all PDA alarms so that you can delete alarm settings from a single screen. It would be even better if you could launch the Reminder screen from the main menu, but the only way to see it right now is to wait until an alarm activates.\nThe next two OS improvements fall into the \"it's about time\" category. First, you can now use both Graffiti and the virtual keyboard for data entry while the virtual keyboard input screen is open (previously you had to close the keyboard screen to use Graffiti). The second of these improvements is the addition of Time Zone and Daylight Savings settings to the PDA's Clock application.\nVersion 4.0 also adds an Address Book Dial command to complement the Palm Mobile Connectivity software. When used with a cell phone and the appropriate connection, you can dial contacts automatically. All you have to do is select the contact in the Address List or Address View and tap Menu, Record, and then Dial. If your cell phone's modem supports infrared, you can beam numbers automatically. Of course, the phone has to be in infrared modem mode. Rounding out the enhancements is support for HTML, frames, tables, and images for viewing Web page clippings.\nSignificant enhancements have also been made in the Palm Desktop for Windows 4.0 software (free download). These improvements are good enough to make the PIM capabilities worth trying, with or without a synchronized PDA. We like the new color themes and custom-viewing options for the Date Book and Address Book in particular. You can now change the background from crimson rose to emerald green and select yearlong or multiple-month calendar views. The program supports exporting appointment records in vCal format and contacts in vCard format, which allows your associates to import your records into compatible PIMs, such as Microsoft Outlook. The standard Palm OS Notes application is integrated in the Palm Desktop software. It includes useful options for transcribing handwritten notes or exporting them to desktop programs, such as Microsoft Word.\nThough Palm OS 4.0 is now available in the new m500 and m505 models, an exact date (or even month) has not yet been set for the release of the 4.0 upgrade. The company says it plans to release the upgrade for older Palms with flash ROM sometime this summer. At"}

However, there are other midsize SUVs worth looking at. The all-new Volkswagen Atlas comes standard with features that are optional in the Pilot \u2013 including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \u2013 and it has more overall space. The Toyota Highlander doesn\u2019t have as much cabin space or engine power as the Pilot, but it comes with a ton more standard driver assistance features. The redesigned Honda Odyssey is a less expensive, eight-seat option to consider.\nShould I Buy a New or Used Honda Pilot?\nHonda completely redesigned the Pilot for the 2016 model year. Since then, the Pilot has seen few changes. This means you can likely find a similarly equipped 2016 or 2017 Pilot for a lot less money than a new one.

That's Kepler 90i, not Earth.\nSaturn's rings sure are pretty, and Matt Damon\u2019s been to Mars, but our eight-planet solar system may not be that special after all. Today, scientists using data from NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft announced they\u2019d discovered an eighth planet orbiting a star 2,500 light years away. They\u2019ve named the planet Kepler-90i after the star it orbits, Kepler-90, which is slightly hotter and more massive than our sun. \u201cThis discovery of an eighth planet ties Kepler-90 with our own solar system for having the most known planets,\u201d said NASA astrophysicist Paul Hertz during a press conference about the discovery.\nResearchers found the exoplanet by re-sifting through four years of data from a Kepler instrument called a photometer, a machine that measures the brightness of stars. Between 2009 and 2013, Kepler took pictures of 200,000 stars every half hour, about 10 pixels per picture. If a star dims and brightens in a repeating cycle, that could mean a planet is orbiting it. And depending on how gradually it dims and how quickly it brightens, you can infer information about the length of its orbit and the size of the planet.\nBut the signs of Kepler-90i didn\u2019t just jump out at them. The secret to their success: a neural network trained to identify exoplanets, developed by University of Texas at Austin astronomer Andrew Vanderburg and Google software engineer Christopher Shallue.\nShallue came up with the idea. A mathematician by training, he had never worked in astronomy\u2014but he\u2019d read Human Universe by Brian Cox. \u201cOne thing the book mentioned was that in astronomy, our ability to collect data is growing much more rapidly than our ability to manually examine the data,\u201d says Shallue.\n\u201cIt probably took half an hour to thoroughly vet one of those signals,\u201d says astronomer Susan Mullally of the Space Telescope Science Institute, who helped develop sorting algorithms for Kepler that predate Shallue and Vanderburg\u2019s neural network. When Mullally worked on Kepler data, the automated program gave her 32,000 potential exoplanets\u2014of which 4,000 were eventually confirmed using Mullally\u2019s algorithms.. \u201cNo one astronomer wants to look through 32,000 signals,\u201d she says.\nShallue thought machine learning could help. He cold e-mailed Vanderburg with his idea. \u201cI found his name by just doing Google search of people who had been discovering exoplanets,\u201d says Shallue.\nThey developed a neural network, not unlike the kind that can auto-tag your dog in a photograph, and trained it with 15,000 astronomer-confirmed exoplanet signals. It actually took Shallue two weeks to download all the training data from NASA\u2019s website. \u201cThe dataset was too large to fit onto my desktop computer at work, so I had to periodically download parts of the dataset, upload it to the cloud, and delete the part that I downloaded,\u201d he says. Then, they gave the neural network a binary task: to tell them which files in Kepler\u2019s terabytes of data contained exoplanets.\nThen they decided to take a closer look at 670 stars with known exoplanets other researchers had already studied, searching for weaker signals others might have missed.

Sun Online Travel explains what happens when a hole appears in a pressurised aircraft flying at 35,000ft in the air.\nWhy is the air pressure different outside the plane?\nThe air pressure inside the plane is much higher than outside the plane, because the air is very thin at an altitude of 35,000 feet.\nThis means that humans can\u2019t breathe well enough to get sufficient oxygen and develop hypoxia \u2013 a condition where the body gradually shuts down and can eventually die.\nAs a result of this, aircraft cabins are typically pressured to around the same level as is typically found at sea level.\nWhy is air pressure a problem if a hole appears in the plane?\nThe stark difference in air pressure inside and outside the plane becomes a problem if a hole appears in the aircraft.\nIf a large enough hole appears, the aircraft is at serious risk of explosive decompression.\nThe air inside the cabin would be pushed to the outside incredibly quickly - as fast as 0.5 seconds.\nIf only a small hole appears, a bullet hole size for instance, it may not have too much of an effect as the air system would be able to compensate for the loss of pressure.\nWhat happens to passengers if a large enough hole appears in the plane?\nPassengers would hear a loud bang like an explosion, followed by violent jerks.\nClouds of condensed air may then begin to form inside the plane and passengers would feel all of the air in the cabin and would be sucked out very quickly.\nLoose items like cups and cutlery could then start flying through the cabin.\nAt this point, the oxygen masks would fall from the ceiling.\nAccording to Air And Space magazine, every plane that flies above 15,000 feet must carry at least ten minutes of oxygen per passenger.\nThe reason that flight safety announcements tell passengers with children to put their own mask on first is because hypoxia happens very quickly.\nIt starts by slowing down the brain, which makes a person feel drunk or stoned, so by the time they put on their child\u2019s mask they may be unable to do the same for themselves.\nThe pilots would then descend the plane very quickly to a height where the masks are no longer needed.\nWhat are the chances of being sucked outside of a plane if a hole appears?\nOn yesterday\u2019s flight, Jennifer Riordan was partially sucked out of the window but was pulled back by heroic passengers.\nIn 2016, a suicide bomber responsible for an explosion that tore a hole in the side of a jet in Somalia was also sucked out of the plane and died, and there have been several other similar incidents.\nBut there is a strong chance of surviving even if you are next to the hole if your seatbelt is fastened.\nThomas Anthony, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s aviation safety and security program told The Verge that it\u2019s probably best to avoid the window seat"}

{"idx": "10226", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: When Andrew Holness was monarchically anointed head of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) by then Prime Minister Bruce Golding, I was one of the strong critics of such a move. It was not that I thought Holness did not have it in him to be a good leader. In fact, his stint at the ministry of education had demonstrated latent leadership and management capabilities which, if properly honed and directed, could augur well for him as a future leader of the party and government. My concern arose out of a visceral suspicion of such anointing of political leaders in a democracy.\nI felt then, and still feel, that those who aspire to leadership - especially of a political party - must face the acid test of competition for that office. Furthermore, it would isolate others who felt that their time had come and could cause deep fissures to arise within the party.\nNeedless to say, the net result of Andrew Holness\u2019s anointing was the later leadership contest for the presidency of the party by veteran JLP politician and loyalist Audley Shaw. Some would forget the deep tension in the party when the contest was fully engaged, and combatants on either side spewed invectives at each other. The JLP was in a tailspin and never seemed to get its act together. Andrew was seen as a \"my way or the highway\" sort of person, challenging those who could not get with his programme to head for the proverbial exit.\nHe won the leadership contest, which frankly should have occurred before the anointing, but political egos that have been bruised do not heal easily, and so discontent continued in the party as Holness\u2019s leadership was seen as lacking. Party stalwarts like Mike Henry, Delroy Chuck, Daryl Vaz, and Chris Tufton - who had had disagreements with Holness - were alienated from the mainstream of JLP politics. The party once again seemed destined to reassert its long stint in the Opposition political wilderness.\nBut almost overnight, like a mushroom on well-dewed bovine mess, Andrew emerged as a confident new leader of the JLP. He had listened well to the ultimatum given by influential members of his party to \"shape up or ship out\". These members were understandably concerned about the drifting direction of Alexander Bustamante\u2019s party, and needed Andrew Holness to come up with a set of leadership criteria to justify his continued leadership of the party.\nAnd he responded by reaching out to his erstwhile detractors. In the run-up to the February 25, 2016 General Election he demonstrated that he was the person truly in charge of the party. The public was sold the idea that grievances had been settled and the party was well on the way to healing and readiness for government. The people seemed to have bought into this, as the JLP\u2019s razor-thin margin in the elections demonstrated.\nSince assuming the role of prime minister on his own merits, Holness has shown himself to be a prime minister on the move. He is now more confident than he has ever been. He has demonstrated a humility in governance that is very refreshing and that is a far distance away from charges of arrogance that have come from some detractors. Part of this newfound confidence is evidenced in his communication style. He talks to the Jamaican people as one who is genuinely interested in their welfare. He is studiedly concerned that his policies in fighting crime do not injure the human and civil rights of the ordinary Jamaican. This is commendable, given the long history of those rights being trampled on by successive governments.\nHe list"}

Complete the trade for Davis in the offseason or find a second superstar on the free-agent market and the Lakers can still be the team James envisioned when he signed with them. Any team with James on its roster is always a move or two from contending for a championship.\nThe pertinent question at this moment is whether the Lakers can make the necessary moves before it\u2019s too late \u2014 specifically, before the 34-year-old James is too old.\nFrom strictly a basketball perspective, James\u2019 decision to play for the Lakers never really made sense. Only a championship would be considered a success for a player of his stature and a flagship franchise such as the Lakers. Considering how little the Lakers had going for them outside of James, the only reason to think he could win here was that James appeared to believe he could.\nJames often sees plays unfold before others do. When thinking of how the Lakers would build around him, maybe he was also a step or two ahead of everyone else.\nOnly there now has to be skepticism about some of the assumptions he made, starting with his claim that his prime would extend far beyond that of the ordinary player. The once-indestructible James was sidelined for 17 games because of a strained groin, which is typically what happens when a player his age sustains that type of injury.\nEqually important was an element James never articulated, about his influence in the league and how it could be used to expedite the team\u2019s rebuilding process.\nThe key figure in this part of the plan was his agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.\nFrom the time Paul signed Davis as a client in September, Davis\u2019 possible move to the Lakers was widely speculated.\nBy his actions, James has become a champion of players\u2019 rights in the NBA, transferring the power of who will play where from owners and executives to the players. James constructed a champion in Miami and another in Cleveland.\nPaul\u2019s efforts to force the Pelicans to trade Davis to the Lakers marked the next step of the movement, but were several orders of magnitude more brazen than anything previously attempted. Davis was a bonafide franchise player who was under contract for another season and a half.\nPaul did everything in his power to facilitate a deal, from making Davis\u2019 trade demands public to making the Lakers the only possible destination by declaring his client wouldn\u2019t sign an extension with any other team that had comparable players to offer in exchange for him.\nThe Pelicans refused to give in, not even after the Lakers offered them a package that included Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Ivica Zubac, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, two first-round draft picks and close to $18 million in salary relief.\nThe game of chicken will presumably continue in the summer.\nPaul can continue to limit the Pelicans\u2019 options by insisting Davis won\u2019t sign an extension if traded to certain teams. The Pelicans will then have to decide whether to acquiesce to Paul\u2019s demands and trade Davis to the Lakers, send Davis elsewhere for a modest return, or hold on to him through next season and lose him for nothing in free agency."}

The scope got off to an inauspicious start; its initial images were blurry, a problem that mission team members traced to a slight flaw in Hubble's primary mirror.\nSpacewalking astronauts fixed that problem in December 1993, giving Hubble the sharp focus it's known for today.\nThe 2012 version of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image.\nThat was the first of five servicing missions that repaired, maintained and upgraded the telescope over the years.

Outgoing hospital President Dr. John Mendelsohn will co-lead the institute once he leaves office this summer.\n\"The generosity of this family will help our efforts to realize the long-standing dream of treating a patient's tumor based on its specific genetic abnormality rather than the experience of other patients,\" said Mendelsohn. \"It's our hope that five years from now, thanks to research sponsored by this gift, we will be able to offer such personalized therapy as standard treatment for our patients.\"\nNo one in the Al Nahyan family was available for comment about the gift.\nMendelsohn said the gift was a response to M.D. Anderson's treatment of many patients from the United Arab Emirates over the years. The donation honors Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates for more than 30 years, who died in 2004. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nM.D. Anderson will name the personalized cancer therapy institute building after the late president and the institute itself after the current president. It will name a pancreatic cancer research center to be created with the gift after another son, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nThe gift, to be paid in four installments, breaks the previous medical center philanthropic record by $50 million. Baylor College of Medicine twice received $100 million gifts - from oil executive Dan Duncan in 2006 and from Houston Texans owner Bob McNair in 2007.\nThe only bigger gifts to Texas academic institutions are a bequest to UT-Austin valued at $245 million and a $200 million bequest to Baylor University in Waco.\nSome $100 million of the Khalifa Foundation donation will fund the construction of a state-of-the-art, 600,000 square-foot facility on five acres of M.D. Anderson's main campus. No such facility was planned when M.D. Anderson announced in December it would create the personalized cancer therapy institute. The institute is the brainchild of Mendelsohn, who has worked in targeted therapy for 30 years.\nThe remaining $50 million will be split between the funding of pancreatic cancer research, institute equipment and clinical trials. Three endowed chairs funded from the gift will be named for the three Al Nahyan family members.\nMendelsohn said he's optimistic that personalized cancer therapy, much touted but still a goal, will become a reality as a result of the center and gift. He noted that M.D. Anderson will be sequencing the tumors of each of its 30,000 new patients a year, and that searching for a tumor's likely genetic abnormalities will become cheaper than doing a CT scan.\nMendelsohn returned to Houston on Tuesday following a ceremonial signing of the gift agreement at the Khalifa Foundation in Abu Dhabi Monday.

The legislation allows for a list of exceptions to the ban on school closures, including in the event of \"an invasion,\" \"plague of insects\" or other threats to student safety.\nIt also amends the law to prohibit school employees from using school resources to influence an election, adding language that would also forbid them from coordinating the closure of a school.\nThe bill is a callback to earlier this year, when, at the very end of the 2018 legislative session, teachers who walked out of their classroom watched and waited for lawmakers to pass an education budget. Townsend attempted to introduce a nearly-identical version of this bill as an amendment, which failed along with two others.\nThe walkout closed hundreds of schools, impacting more than 700,000 students and their parents.

Released in 2003 as a patch client for Valve\u2019s lineup of games (specifically, Counter-Strike), Steam has risen to dominate the digital distribution market. Through easy consumer access, frequent sales, and providing a worldwide platform for both mainstream and independent developers, Steam has built a base of more than 150 million users worldwide. In 2017, 7,600 games were released via Steam, leading to $4.3 billion in sales.\nSteam\u2019s ubiquity, ease of use, and market penetration all go a long way, but it\u2019s a mixed blessing for anyone besides, arguably, Valve itself. Independent developers often run into problems with the service\u2019s frequent flash sales, where a 25-75% discount can slash into what can already be a slim profit margin.\nSteam is also a \u201cgames-as-service\u201d model, where you\u2019re paying for indefinite rental of a digital asset, rather than a physical object that you possess. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re low on space, and a boon to the greater games industry (you can\u2019t trade in your digital games to GameStop, which will then resell them for pure profit at no net gain to the games\u2019 actual publishers), but it does mean that your games library is effectively not in your direct control.\nThere have also been arguments in circulation for years, which seem to ebb and flow like the tides, that Steam, like any other digital storefront, is simply overcrowded; it\u2019s a playground for trolls due to being insufficiently moderated; and the ease with which it can be accessed as a market means that there\u2019s a lot of truly tasteless dreck being offered through the service. Steam is indisputably one of the major games-industry success stories of the last twenty years, but especially in recent months, cracks are beginning to show.\nIn the last couple of years, Valve has made several different moves to leverage Steam\u2019s market share in order to shape the games industry as a whole. As we discussed last month, Valve\u2019s Steam Machines were the highly visible part of a larger attempt to popularize their Linux-based SteamOS as a viable gaming platform.\nEven as Valve\u2019s output as a game development studio has notoriously stalled, the company has become quietly evangelical over Linux\u2019s viability, primarily due to Gabe Newell\u2019s notorious dissatisfaction with Windows as a platform. Newell was speaking specifically about Windows 8 at the time, but to this day, many of Valve\u2019s moves can still be readily interpreted as shots across Windows\u2019s bow.\nMicrosoft has been making its own big moves, with initiatives such as Xbox Play Anywhere, which allows full cross-play compatibility between the Xbox One and Windows 10. A game with Play Anywhere functionality can work on either platform, which allows a player to move between the office and living room as their situation dictates. This turns the built-in Windows Store into a potentially lucrative, near-omnipresent digital storefront, giving Microsoft a captive audience for its library of software, and not coincidentally acts as a challenge to Steam\u2019s market dominance.\nHowever, the same initiative also means that there are effectively no real exclusives for the Xbox One. Success or failure in the console market often relies upon a system\u2019s library of unique games, and almost all of the Xbox One\u2019"}

If I traded him for about 30 feet on the back westerly edge of his lot, I would pick up room to build a garage on it. I have included a link to the county GIS map and a sketch demonstrating the new configuration results. Do you think this is a good idea? Bill P. - Rhinelander, WI.\nMonty\u2019s Answer: Bill, it was clever to email a sketch and a link with your question. I reviewed both the link to the property and your sketch. The county GIS information includes topographical and aerial photo layers, which added detail to the perspective. I want to qualify my answer because there is no substitute for being there. If I walked the land, my answer could be different.\nThat said, here is what I would do to determine which option to act on. The land with the most value is the water frontage the neighbor would acquire. In your first sentence, you state the neighbor \u201cwants to buy\u201d. Later, you introduce the concept of trading land with him. The land you are trading away is worth far more than the land you are acquiring, even though the parcel you would acquire is much larger.\nIt appears from the aerial photo there is room to build a garage on the westerly side of the driveway on land you already own. It would be closer to your home and further from the main road. It also appears to require some fill.\nThe 30 feet you are thinking of trading for appears that it will have to be excavated for the garage floor and may require a retaining wall behind the garage. I would ask a local contractor to come to inspect both sites and bring his transit. I have suggestions on how to find that contractor at DearMonty.com. The contractor could better judge which site would require the lowest cost to prepare for actual construction of the garage.\nAdditionally, I would contact the agent that sold the property originally and ask them a few questions and for a favor. I would ask their opinion on the going price for water frontage on your lake or similar lakes. This would provide a sense of the fairness of your neighbors offer. I would then ask them to email MLS data sheets on the 3 or 4 recent vacant lot sales that support their statement.\nI would also ask their opinion of the value increase attributed to adding 30 feet to the back of the easterly portion of your lot. Because they are familiar with the property, it should be relatively easy for them to render an opinion. I expect their estimate would be a negligible amount of money. Because your neighbors lot is vacant and the land he acquires increases the front footage, I suspect it will add value to his entire lot by the value of each additional foot of property acquired.\nIf it were me, I would strongly consider simply selling the neighbor your land on the other side of the slew then apply those proceeds toward the cost of building the garage on land you presently own. This solution preserves your potential capital outlay by the value established for the 30 feet not needed to build the garage.\nLastly, because the action under consideration is a negotiation, if you were able to negotiate for the"}

This message helps people decide how vigorously to work toward a goal, while also allowing themselves to learn from mistakes.\n\u201cWe provide a new theoretical account for how dopamine affects learning (what to do later) and motivation (getting fired up to go now) simultaneously,\u201d said study lead author Hamid, U-M neuroscience doctoral student.\nFor many years, researchers have known that dopamine is important for arousal, movement, mood and executing activities with haste and vigor. Aspects of these normal dopamine functions are highlighted in disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and depression. Drugs that elevate brain dopamine levels, like cocaine or amphetamines, produce euphoric feelings of well-being, in addition to heightened arousal and attention.\nAside from affecting immediate mood and behavior, dopamine also produces changes in the brain that are persistent, sometimes lasting a lifetime.\n\u201cThis is basically how we stamp in memories of what the smell of cookies or the McDonald\u2019s sign mean: predictors of delicious, calorie rich rewards,\u201d Hamid said.\nAbrupt dopamine increases when a person perceives stimuli that predict rewards is a dominant mechanism of reward learning within the brain\u2014a concept similar to Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov\u2019s dog hearing the bell and salivating at a response to stimuli, he said.\nHamid said the precise mechanism of how a neurotransmitter can achieve both invigorating and learning functions is counterintuitive, and many decades of neuropsychological research has attempted to resolve exactly how.\nOne theory, spearheaded by U-M psychologists Kent Berridge and Terry Robinson, suggests that dopamine invigorates actions toward desired goals. For example, rats with almost no brain dopamine will not retrieve food a few inches away while they\u2019re starving.\nAnother theory suggests dopamine is a \u201cteaching signal,\u201d like a coach who tells his player \u201cgood job\u201d or \u201cbad job\u201d to encourage a future reward. In the current study, U-M researchers describe those dopamine fluctuations as a continuous cheer to motivate, with brief moments of criticism.\nThey measured dopamine levels in rats while they performed a decision-making task, and compared it with how motivated the rats were and how much they learned. They also increased dopamine levels to artificially motivate the rats and repeatedly made them learn to perform actions that did not produce rewards.\nThe findings appear in the current issue of Nature Neuroscience.\nThe study\u2019s other authors include Jeffrey Pettibone, Omar Mabrouk, Vaughn Hetrick, Robert Schmidt, Caitlin Vander Weele, Robert Kennedy and Brandon Aragona.\nThe work was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (DA032259, DA007281), National Institute of Mental Health (MH093888, MH101697), National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NS078435, NS076401) and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (EB003320).

{"idx": "10257", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In the wake of Russia's increasingly belligerent behavior in Ukraine, President Barack Obama delivered a ringing declaration of NATO's support for the Baltic countries Wednesday in the capital of Estonia, a former Soviet Republic and current NATO member that also has reason to fear Russian aggression. Mr. Obama vowed the U.S. and NATO would honor the alliance's pledge of collective defense and back it up with a beefed-up troop presence and air patrols. He also pointed to NATO's decision to create a rapid reaction force and pre-positioning of military equipment in the region as evidence of the alliance's resolve to defend its members.\nMr. Obama's remarks clearly were prompted by Russia's slow-motion invasion of Ukraine where armed separatists backed by Moscow in the eastern part of the country are demanding independence from the government in Kiev. The conflict threatens to upset the post-Cold War order in Europe, a possibility Mr. Obama alluded to when he said no country can be allowed to redraw international borders at the point of a gun. Unfortunately, he was saying that in Tallinn, not in Kiev. It's NATO's response to Russian aggression there that's most worrisome.\nIt was probably no coincidence that on the same day Mr. Obama spoke in Tallinn, early reports surfaced in Kiev that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a cease fire between government troops and the rebels. The news sparked hopes the conflict might finally be winding down, but almost immediately the purported accord began to unravel.\nMr. Poroshenko issued a clarification suggesting what he and Mr. Putin had discussed was a cease fire \"regime\" \u2014 presumably meaning the conditions under which talks could proceed and the subjects to be covered \u2014 rather than an actual halt in the fighting. A few hours later the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement confirming the conversation between Mr. Putin and Mr. Poroshenko had taken place but then went on to insist Mr. Putin could not possibly agree to a cease fire since Russia was not a party to the conflict \u2014 a preposterous claim given NATO reports that thousands of Russian troops, along with their armor and artillery, have crossed the border into Ukraine in recent weeks.\nIn denying that Russia had any hand in supplying, arming and backing up the rebels with its own forces, Mr. Putin revealed himself as a master practitioner of the Big Lie, defined as a falsehood so blatantly absurd that people simply refuse to believe anyone would dare utter it unless it were true \u2014 so therefore it must be true. While the world was still reeling from that whopper, Mr. Putin quickly followed up with another: A \"peace plan\" that would require Kiev to withdraw all its troops from eastern Ukraine and allow separatists there to set up a Russian puppet state called, appropriately enough, \"Novorossiya,\" or \"New Russia.\" All would be well if the Ukrainian government would only accept his proposal, Mr. Putin said.\nComing on top of Mr. Putin's seemingly offhand comment recently that Russian troops could be in Kiev within two weeks, the message of his \"peace plan\" was clear: Surrender or risk a full-blown invasion and the toppling of your government.\nNATO and the E.U. seem have been caught off guard by the shamelessness of Mr. Putin's tactics. Perhaps that's because the Europeans have been reluctant to acknowledge the presence in their midst of an aggressive hostile power that reminds them of a painful"}

As it turns out, there was a reason for that: some of the new Pixel smartphones\u2018 best features won\u2019t be arriving in the new OS. This includes features like Google Assistant, the built-in customer support service, unlimited and free backup of full-res photos and videos, Smart Storage, and more.\nDetails on which features were \u201cPixel-only\u201d were previously reported by Android Police, citing a changelog provided by a Google source. Google confirmed to us those changes are accurate.\nSome of the omissions make sense. For example, only Pixel phones will ship with the new, \u201cquick switch\u201d adapter that makes it easier to move your data from iPhone to Android. That requires hardware in the form of the adapter cable.\nThe Pixel\u2019s Camera app is also tied to the phones\u2019 new hardware \u2013 that is, the Pixel sports a 12.3-megapixel rear camera which lets you shoot 4K video, and offers special modes like \u201cSmartburst\u201d for taking several photos in succession, among other things.\nPlus, the Pixel features a Sensor Hub processor with tightly integrated sensors and connectivity (i.e., Wi-Fi, cellular, GPS).\nOne could even argue that bundling the free, unlimited photo and video backup service, via Google Photos, is just good marketing. It makes the Pixel smartphone more appealing to photo enthusiasts, who are looking for a reason to upgrade their current Android device, or perhaps pick the Pixel over the iPhone 7, where iCloud storage still costs money.\nHowever, some of the missing features are more surprising.\nMost notably, Android 7.1, the updated version of Nougat that powers the Pixel and Pixel XL, is lacking Google Assistant. This smart virtual helper is Google\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It\u2019s a lot more robust than Google Now, the current digital assistant that ships on today\u2019s Android devices and in the standalone Google app.\nGoogle Now is already fairly powerful \u2013 it lets you talk to it using natural language, and offers a variety of assistance, similar to rivals. This ranges from sending you alerts of information you care about \u2013 like how long it will take to get home on your commute, or when to leave to catch a flight, when your package will arrive, as well as weather, sports and stock information, or reminders of upcoming events, and more.\nIt can also serve as a jumping off point for Google searches, by answering questions about nearby places, like restaurants or shops, or simply searching the web. And it offers more utilitarian functions, such as adjusting device functions, sending texts and emails, placing calls, or creating reminders.\nBut Google Assistant is like an upgraded, smarter Google Now. It can do everything Now does, but its underlying A.I. technology is capable of having a two-way conversation with you, and can learn and recall personal details you share with it, then recall them in future chats. You can ask it to give you daily updates on information you want to track through a subscription feature.\nIt also works with Chromecast and other Google Cast-enabled devices, and offers the ability to control smart home devices from Nest, SmartThings and Philips Hue.\nGiven Assistant\u2019s increased prowess, it\u2019s disappointing that it\u2019s not immediately replacing Google Now in the Android 7.1 update. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t ever arrive"}

At the end of 2018, however, the country saw what seemed like a bit of good news: successful negotiations in Stockholm that offered the promise of a peaceful settlement, or at least a lasting ceasefire. These negotiations, however, may not be the solution to Yemen\u2019s problems. Ariel Ahram of the University of Vermont argues that the Stockholm Agreement is at best incomplete and at worst could exacerbate the violence. Ahram contends the international community might be better off trying to build up local orders rather than preserving a fiction of a unified Yemen.\nThe Stockholm Agreement, signed on December 13, 2018, is the first good news regarding Yemen in a long time, even though implementation has been uneven. The UN-brokered agreement provides a conduit for aid through Hodeidah, the demilitarization of Taiz, and an exchange of prisoners. More than a month into the arrangement, the deal is intact despite a \u201ccomplicated\u201d implementation, UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths said last week. There is still sporadic fighting around Hodeidah and Taiz and violence continues unabated in areas not covered by the agreement, including Sana\u2019a. In January, UN mediators convened a new set of meetings in Amman to clarify the agreement, boost confidence, and solidify enforcement. Despite this rocky start, it is a significant diplomatic step toward potential conciliation between the internationally-recognized government of Abdarrabah Mansur Hadi and Houthi rebels who have held Sanaa since 2014.\nAll parties admit that the ceasefire can only succeed if Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iran act to restrain their respective proxy forces, which are deeply enmeshed in the conflict. In a wider sense, the agreement represents a de-escalation in what some call the Middle East\u2019s cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Much of this larger regional conflict has been conducted indirectly via proxy militias. In Yemen, however, Riyadh was determined to deny the Houthis and their Iranian allies a foothold on the Arabian Peninsula. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates launched expeditionary forces to counter the Houthi advances and support the Hadi government. Equipped and supported by the United States, the joint Saudi and Emirati campaign worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has prompted the United States to reconsider its blank check to the Saudis, which may be decisive for diplomatic mediation.\nFor all of the immediate good that the Stockholm Agreement might do, it also complicates the long-term search for conflict resolution. Yemen is suffering through three separate but interlinked wars: 1) the civil war in the north between the Houthis and the central government, 2) another civil war between the central government and the Southern Movement (SM), a loose coalition of separatists centered around Aden, Shebwa, and Hadramaut, and 3) a nationwide campaign against radical Islamist terrorists groups, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). These conflicts began in the 1990s and 2000s and annealed during the popular uprising, the splintering of the Yemen security services, and the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011 and 2012.

Get used to it.\nPope Francis, the most interesting man in the world, has made yet another stride toward enlightening the secular and religious worlds alike. In his recent interview with an Italian newspaper, the pontiff signaled a potential future where Catholics approve of gay rights. When asked if regulating civil unions is a road the Church can understand, the Pope replied, \"We have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety.\"\nSure, he prefaced this with, \"Marriage is between a man and a woman.\" But \"civil union\" is whole other beast, and Francis is a nuanced wizard of semantics. If ever there were a man to lead the ignorant to scientific enlightenment, that man is the current pope.\nIt's more leadership with a refreshing sensitivity, perception, and logic from Francis, who knows that giving the Church a facelift is priority numero uno.\nIn the Information Age, the Church can no longer preach \"shame on you\" from a soapbox of ignorance and denial. There are too many voices to ignore or deny validity, and there are too many unique souls within humankind to expect a uniform anything.\nThe world needs more understanding, understanding has never been more accessible, and nobody believes this more than Francis.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan tried to clarify it all in his recent interview with NBC, \"Francis is reminding us, 'Look, if [the Church comes] across as some crabby, naysaying shrill, we're not going to win anybody. If we come across as a loving, embracing mother, Holy Mother Church, who says come on in. We love you. We need you. We want you. And once you get to know us, then maybe we can invite you to the conversion of heart that is at the core of the gospel. And then maybe we can talk about changing behavior.'\"\nThe Catholic Church not only has a bevy of skeletons in the closet, it has gone out of its way to vilify all doctrinal opposition in the past. Francis serves as the antithesis of papal stereotypes. He drives a 1984 jalopy, lives in a modest apartment, and avoids all things ostentatious. He uses social media and kisses the feet of Muslim convicts. With his every subversion of typical pope behavior come new admirers, and he's using the newfound attention to deliver the resounding message that the church was, you know, based upon: kindness and understanding come before religious dogma and condemnation.\nFrancis is doing his best to include all of humanity in a loving and, more importantly, understanding manner. As Cardinal Dolan points out, \"We have a Pope that says, 'I want to ask the right questions. I want to point people to the place where they can get the answers.'\""}

The court\u2019s decision however, is not final and is expected to be appealed to a higher administrative court.\nOn Saturday the protesters' way was cut off by police who fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to disperse the protesters and stop them from entering the square.\nDespite the warning, some 3,000 demonstrators, chanted \"Together against fascism\" and \"Everywhere is resistance\", gathered in the Istiklal Avenue to march to the cordoned-off park near Taksim Square.\nAccording to reports, fighting between the security forces and protesters started after some of the demonstrators argued with police over their right to enter Gezi park.\n\"Hurriyet TV shows images of one child affected by tear gas. Repressors against all,\" reads the tweet.\nThe demonstration had been scheduled for 7 pm local time.\nThe water cannon was reportededly deployed down side-streets close to the square. One side street, Istiklal, was the scene of tear gas deployment on June 22, when clouds were unleashed on crowds ushered away from the square.\nTroops hounded the protesters back into the side streets in what bystanders labeled the biggest police intervention since mid-June. Several people were detained by police, according to Reuters.\n\"The Constitution says that anyone can stage a demonstration without giving notification, but the legislation says that applying to the authorities for permission is mandatory. So nobody can say they exercise their constitutional rights. This is unlawful,\" Gov. H\u00fcseyin Avni Mutlu had told reporters in response to news of the protest.\nApproximately 2.5 million people have taken to the streets across Turkey since May 31, when a harsh police crackdown against activists in Istanbul\u2019s Gezi Park prompted mass nationwide anti-government protests, according to a report published by Turkish"}

It won\u2019t wean the world off oil, but it could enable this Lexington, MA-based company and its partners to claim they\u2019re helping to green up the planet, all the while pursuing a $200 million market opportunity.\nI heard the Microbia story last week during a conversation with CEO Richard Bailey. It\u2019s kind of a twisting tale that begins with basic research at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge and gave birth to a couple different companies along the way.\nBefore diving into all that, here\u2019s the gist: Microbia now fashions itself as an industrial biotech company that has found ways to finesse yeast, bacteria and other fermentation materials into pumping out big-time yields of special chemicals. These new versions of carotenoid chemicals, like beta-carotene and canthaxanthin (used to make cheese look orange and salmon look pink, among other things), come from renewable sources instead of petrochemical derivatives.\n\u201cPetroleum won\u2019t be here forever,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cGreen chemistry does sell, but it has to come at price parity,\u201d to the existing methods.\nHow Microbia has gotten itself into this position is an interesting story about how science can lead down unpredictable paths. It was started in 1998 by scientists at the Whitehead Institute. The early work was heavy on how yeast strains become pathogenic, or diseased. This led to insights into how to turn yeast into a cheap, effective factory for all sorts of chemicals, Bailey says. The company put that knowledge to work via fee-based contracts with other companies, which reduced its cash burn for years, while another side of Microbia focused on using the knowledge to develop its own drugs.\nBailey, a veteran of Monsanto\u2019s nutrition division, came on board as general manager to run the industrial side of the company back in 2002. At that time, the place had great science but needed some business strategy, in his view. \u201cThere was a lot of work on science; I\u2019d argue too much,\u201d Bailey says.\nThat same year, Microbia partnered with Tate & Lyle, the London-based maker of Splenda sweetener and other food and industrial ingredients. Tate & Lyle invested $7 million to acquire a 15 percent stake in the newly spun off company and agreed to provide $13.75 million more over five years. Tate & Lyle hopes to get new products on the market faster through the deal, and in return, Microbia gets a share of the profits of any products it helps develop for the British firm. The deal has enabled Microbia to grow from about 15 to 50 employees and get the two carotenoid products primed for the marketplace next year, Bailey says.\nA lot of things obviously still need to happen before Microbia will start making a big impact in the market with its own products. But it\u2019s clearly not a science project anymore. In the past few months the company hired three people with experience on the business side of the specialty-chemical industry to fill top commercialization roles."}

Sometimes a torn, ugly, bulging burrito is the price you pay, right?\nHannah DePaulis, Chipotle's mid-Atlantic marketing strategist, and Courtney Harlin, the general manager of the Shrewsbury, Pa. Chipotle, have a few simple tips to help.\nDon't bring a taco to a burrito roll.\nWhen buying ingredients, look for big tortillas. Really big.\nDePaulis called Chipotle's tortillas \"massive.\" And while it might be tough to find ones that big at the store, you can look for \"burrito style\" tortillas. Those will be significantly larger than a typical soft taco shell.\nThis is key: The tortilla needs to be warm so it can expand to accommodate all your ingredients without ripping.\nThat's why you'll see tortilla presses at restaurants like Chipotle. And that's why it's best to make burritos in a hurry, so the tortilla remains warm.\nDePaulis says an oven or a microwave will work just fine for homemade burritos.\nIn Harlin's experience, a warmed shell can expand to accommodate huge amounts of food.\nShe said that, at times, burritos can be so large they won't fit in the restaurant's pre-cut foil. But because the shell was warm, the burrito still didn't rip.\nHarlin says a simple tip can help you roll the perfect burrito or even salvage one that didn't go so well on the first roll: Get all the ingredients together in the center.\nThat helps make sure they are spread evenly throughout and it gives you room to work on rolling the edges.\nOf course, it helps if you have a sensible amount of ingredients to begin with (Chipotle uses 4 oz. servings \u2014 roughly the size of a large serving spoon).\nFold the burrito in half and gently clamp all the ingredients together in the palm of your hand. It should almost look like a large ravioli \u2014 a mound of filling in the center with a wide border of tortilla around.\nThe Chipotle crew admits that rolling the perfect burrito is an art.\nIf your finished product isn't quite right, there's good news."}

{"idx": "10285", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The political galleries are full of people asking will he or won't he run for mayor here. But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, as he so often does, is playing a more elaborate political game, one in which his potential candidacy for office provides both a platform and his strongest bargaining chip.\nThe Democratic Party should find a way to win statehood for the District of Columbia, thus creating a Senate seat he can run for, or he will do the thing that strikes fear in the hearts of many Democrats. He will run for President again.\nBut it's not quite that simple. Jesse Jackson's remarks are always more intricate then they seem. In the week since Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington was charged with possessing crack provided by an F.B.I. informer, Mr. Jackson has said many things about local politics. His comments were reported in a front-page article in The Washington Post to mean that he was leaning toward a run for mayor. But his comments persuaded a columnist for The New York Times, A. M. Rosenthal, that he was not running for mayor.\nThis confusing pattern - or pattern of confusion - is familiar to those who have known Mr. Jackson a long time. ''He's saying different things to different people within minutes,'' not just to reporters but even to friends and advisers, said a longtime associate.\nSome of this is just the Jackson style. He is unusually accessible for a major public figure, and tries out ideas on whoever happens to be around.\nBut there is more. Mr. Jackson, his associates say, has not made up his mind whether to run, although most of his staff believe he is leaning against running. What is certain is that he will not let this moment pass without getting all the attention he can on his larger agenda, which includes a platform for his liberal views and what he calls ''options'' for higher office.\nSince his days in the civil rights movement Mr. Jackson has practiced what Frank Watkins, a friend and longtime associate, calls ''leverage'' politics. For example, the threat of an economic boycott produced the leverage to pressure auto makers to grant dealerships to blacks, and these dealers remain among the core of Mr. Jackson's financial contributors.\nIn the spring and summer of 1988, when Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts had the Democratic nomination locked up, Mr. Jackson carried on his campaign for President because it gave him leverage to negotiate things like his travel budget for the fall Democratic campaign and changes in party rules that could help a Jackson Presidential candidacy, if there is one, in 1992.\nThis style of politics has often led to the misplaced question, ''What does Jesse want?'' As in any bargaining situation, what he wants is the best deal he can get. The only way to find out is to exert pressure in various directions, or use leverage, and see what happens.\nThat is what is going on now. And Mr. Jackson says he has ''no plans'' to run for mayor, giving the field-tested response of candidates who are not ready to say they are candidates. A television reporter demanded of Mr. Jackson why he did not make a simple declarative statement that he was not running. ''Why should I in public service give up leverage and options to satisfy some urge?'' he replied.\nTwo things give Mr. Jackson leverage now. The first is that as long as he puts off a decision on running for mayor, he has the attention of those who want him to run and those who do not. The second is the question whether he will run for President for a third time.\nTo comprehend Mr. Jackson's plan requires an understanding"}

Yet there\u2019s a corner-cutting quality to the series \u2014 beginning with the casting \u2014 that makes this feel like a decidedly off-Broadway effort. So while WE has demonstrated it\u2019s willing to order drama as the network rebrands itself, the channel faces more work to prove it can be a significant player in this crowded field.\nThere\u2019s no nice way to say the leads simply aren\u2019t especially compelling, which might help better sell this otherwise familiar tale that hinges on a central mystery built around a death-penalty case.\nMarin Ireland plays Christine Rosa, an ambitious law student working for something called the Innocence Initiative, which endeavors to help those who the criminal-justice system has mistreated. In her eagerness, she steps out of bounds, in the eyes of her boss (Paul Schneider), by seeking to help a white inmate, Jared Bankowski (Chris Bauer), due to be executed in a few weeks for the murder of a well-to-do African-American family 12 years earlier, even though he hasn\u2019t sought help or made any protestations regarding his innocence.\nUltimately, it all plays like the old adventures of new Christine. Her investigation naturally threatens entrenched interests, including a prosecutor (Damon Gupton) who burnished his reputation by winning a conviction in the case, which at the time had threatened to divide the city. Christine, however, is the kind of hard-driving idealist (with a backstory to help explain why) who won\u2019t let go, which raises the specter of reopening old wounds, endangering careers and fraying relationships.\nIn the right hands, this might all be more interesting. But the two pivotal roles don\u2019t convey much pop, hinting at the show\u2019s limitations, and being partly responsible for them. The same goes for the central mystery \u2014 if Bankowski and the other fellow convicted didn\u2019t commit the murders, who did? \u2014 which reflects the kind of story Investigation Discovery regularly dispenses in an hour or less.\nAs the writer of such films as \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County,\u201d LaGravenese does provide his cast with some sharp dialogue in places \u2014 Schneider\u2019s character tells Christine, as a lawyer, to \u201cget used to knowing what should happen, and accepting what does\u201d \u2014 but it can\u2019t lift the material beyond formula.\nBased on what\u2019s here, there\u2019s also something mildly pretentious about the producers\u2019 promise (in a note to media) to examine \u201cwhere racism exists in today\u2019s \u2018Obama\u2019s America,\u2019\u2009\u201d while opening the show with a quote from Nietzsche.\nIt\u2019s clear the title \u201cThe Divide\u201d is intended to refer to various rifts in society.

They could reap big rewards if peace is restored.\nFar beneath the surface of the tragic drama of Somalia, four major U.S. oil companies are quietly sitting on a prospective fortune in exclusive concessions to explore and exploit tens of millions of acres of the Somali countryside.\nThat land, in the opinion of geologists and industry sources, could yield significant amounts of oil and natural gas if the U.S.-led military mission can restore peace to the impoverished East African nation.\nAccording to documents obtained by The Times, nearly two-thirds of Somalia was allocated to the American oil giants Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips in the final years before Somalia's pro-U.S. President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown and the nation plunged into chaos in January, 1991. Industry sources said the companies holding the rights to the most promising concessions are hoping that the Bush Administration's decision to send U.S. troops to safeguard aid shipments to Somalia will also help protect their multimillion-dollar investments there.\nOfficially, the Administration and the State Department insist that the U.S. military mission in Somalia is strictly humanitarian. Oil industry spokesmen dismissed as \"absurd\" and \"nonsense\" allegations by aid experts, veteran East Africa analysts and several prominent Somalis that President Bush, a former Texas oilman, was moved to act in Somalia, at least in part, by the U.S. corporate oil stake.\nBut corporate and scientific documents disclosed that the American companies are well positioned to pursue Somalia's most promising potential oil reserves the moment the nation is pacified. And the State Department and U.S. military officials acknowledge that one of those oil companies has done more than simply sit back and hope for peace.\nConoco Inc., the only major multinational corporation to maintain a functioning office in Mogadishu throughout the past two years of nationwide anarchy, has been directly involved in the U.S. government's role in the U.N.-sponsored humanitarian military effort.\nConoco, whose tireless exploration efforts in north-central Somalia reportedly had yielded the most encouraging prospects just before Siad Barre's fall, permitted its Mogadishu corporate compound to be transformed into a de facto American embassy a few days before the U.S. Marines landed in the capital, with Bush's special envoy using it as his temporary headquarters. In addition, the president of the company's subsidiary in Somalia won high official praise for serving as the government's volunteer \"facilitator\" during the months before and during the U.S. intervention.\nDescribing the arrangement as \"a business relationship,\" an official spokesman for the Houston-based parent corporation of Conoco Somalia Ltd. said the U.S. government was paying rental for its use of the compound, and he insisted that Conoco was proud of resident general manager Raymond Marchand's contribution to the U.S.-led humanitarian effort.\nJohn Geybauer, spokesman for Conoco Oil in Houston, said the company was acting as \"a good corporate citizen and neighbor\" in granting the U.S. government's request to be allowed to rent the compound. The U.S. Embassy and most other buildings and residential compounds here in the capital were rendered unusable by vandalism and fierce artillery duels during the clan wars that have consumed Somalia and starved its people."}

He cautioned that unless things change in how the county spends money, it will not have sufficient cash for future operations.\n\"These audit results continue to show a decline in the financial standpoint of the county,\" he said.\nSchmersahl pointed to the rise of underfunded pension liabilities, the continued decline of sales tax receipts and limited increases in property tax revenue due to PTELL as contributing factors to his conclusion.\n\"The message here is a continuing decline in the financial position (of the county) and without a correction, you'll run out of money,\" he said.\nAccording to the audit, the county's pension liabilities were overfunded by $477,840 in 2006.

A typhoon has devastated the already impoverished Philippines; tornadoes have ripped through the mid-west; and millions of people are lost in a maze because of the myriad of problems with implementing the \"Affordable Care Act.\"\nYet in the midst of the calamities of life, there is still a clarion call from saints who came before us to be thankful. As I read the words from the Book of Acts I am amazed that these early converts could be so joyful and thankful. You see, their conversion put them on a collision course with those who opposed them, both Jewish and Roman.\nPersecution would come in many forms, prison, beatings, being shunned by family and friends, and even death. Yet in the midst of these threats they still gave thanks to God.\nDr. Christine Pohl, at Asbury Theological Seminary, rightly reminds us that the only true response to grace is gratitude. I remember once visiting a man who was injured in a motorcycle accident. He was in a full body cast when I approached his bed. The first thing he said to me was that he was grateful. I surmised that he meant he was thankful because he was at least alive. However, what he was really thankful for was that he had not allowed his young daughter to ride with him that day. In the midst of any situation we can find a reason to be thankful to God.\nIf I start making a list, my prayer would take hours. However, let me suggest a few things. I am grateful for a family that loves me, for a church that loves everyone, and for a community that has accepted me and my family and allowed us to be at home here. I am grateful for the friends who fill my life with so much support and care. I am grateful to have a home, clothes on my back, and food to eat.\nYet, most of all I am grateful that God so loved the world (including a sinner like me) that he sent his only son to die on a cross for the sins of the world. Now my life is wrapped in peace and hope not sin and death. Now I can sing praises to the God of my Salvation instead of lamenting how unfair the world is.\nWell, you can make your own list, and I hope you do, to lift up to God this Thanksgiving.\" Let us give thanks to the God who has given all that we need to have abundant and meaningful lives and let's do it by living thankful lives as those early believers in Acts did.\nThanksgiving cannot be just words it must be actions. Show the world you are a thankful person by being generous with your prayers, your gifts, your service, and your witness. A glad and generous heart is a heart that can change the world."}

He was assisted by his niece's governess, who also shared the author's bed on occasion.\nFlaubert's version would have been the one to put on audio cassette, given his obsession with rhythm and precision. But according to Herbert Lottman's excellent biography, \"Flaubert\" (Little, Brown, 1989), that translation has never been found.\nIt is astonishing that this first English translation of \"Madame Bovary\" came out so long after the novel's publication. Even in Flaubert's day the book's realistic detail and the detachment of its narrator were recognized as monumental steps in the craft of the novel.\nThat detachment, incidentally, was one reason Flaubert was charged by the French government with \"transgressing against morality and religion\" when \"Madame Bovary\" first ran in magazine installments.\nThe state censors were outraged that the author drew no moral lessons from Emma Bovary's adulteries, and they felt certain passages ridiculed religion.\nThe judge concluded that \"Madame Bovary\" was a serious work and declared Flaubert not guilty.\nIt had been so long since I read \"Madame Bovary\" that I had forgotten much of it when I sampled the recorded versions. Or maybe listening to it was such a different experience that certain scenes seemed totally new to me.\nTake the description of the agricultural fair. Lottman says Flaubert worked on it endlessly in order to blend the doings in the background with what was going on in the foreground--\"a gentleman warming up a lady,\" as Flaubert put it in a letter to a friend.\nAs the aristocrat Rodolphe lures Emma Bovary into adultery, the awarding of medals for agricultural projects drones on incongruously in the background.\nI do not remember appreciating the brilliance of that scene when I read the book. But I found it riveting on tape.\nIt must be a special challenge to read this complicated scene for cassette without confusing listeners, but the British actress Davina Porter accomplishes it magnificently for Recorded Books.\nPorter's entire reading of \"Madame Bovary\" is a performance against which all others must be measured. Throughout her reading, which lasts 13 hours, I wanted to replay sentences again and again just to hear her pronounce certain words.\nAnd Porter wickedly reinforces Flaubert's intent when she speaks for the fatuous Monsieur Homais, the character Flaubert created as a send-up of the French bourgeoisie.\nThe Davina Porter reading is available from Recorded Books (800-638-1304) for a monthly rental of $11.50 or outright purchase for $65.95.

The blocks are the result of a collaboration between a local teacher, a resident artist, and a robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University.\nFew trends in K-12 ed tech are as hot\u2014or as underresearched\u2014as \"maker\" education.\nThe term generally refers to using a wide variety of hands-on activities (such as building, computer programming, and even sewing) to support academic learning and the development of a mindset that values playfulness and experimentation, growth and iteration, and collaboration and community.\nThe maker movement has its roots outside of school, in institutions such as science museums and in the informal activities that everyday people have taken part in for generations. It began exploding about a decade ago, thanks in large part to the enthusiastic audience of Make magazine and the popularity of public events such as maker fairs (the best-known of which was hosted by President Barack Obama at the White House in 2014). The rise of cheap digital tools, including microcontroller platforms such as Arduino and rapid-prototyping tools such as 3-D printers, has in recent years lent the movement a decidedly techie flavor.\nWhile exciting, that trend has begotten a number of questions and tensions, many of which are just now beginning to be explored by researchers. Following is a roundup of some recent books, essays, and research studies exploring maker education in K-12. The list is drawn in part from work presented this month at the annual conference of the American Educational Research Association, held here.\nThe case-study school's \"emphasis on trial and error, experimentation, and productive failure sat in uneasy alignment to the school's competency-based curriculum and assessment practices,\" the authors write. \"Many of the students expressed trepidation or anxiety about how their participation in the [maker space] 'counted,' and some expressed reluctance to change material they had worked hard to complete.\"\nThey found that it can work \"for some students, in some ways, at some times.\"\nFirst, the authors say, those involved in maker education need to be willing to tackle educational injustices, such as ensuring that making is not limited to well-resourced schools. Second, the notion of what constitutes legitimate maker activities needs to be broadened to include community-based practices from multiple cultures (think more sewing and crafting, in addition to computer science and robotics). And third, maker education needs to include a heavy focus on effective pedagogy, including a willingness to avoid fetishizing \"self-directed learning\" and instead focus on ensuring that teachers in maker spaces know how to support all students.\nThis oft-cited essay offers a context for analyzing and understanding the maker movement, focusing on the distinctions between making (activities), maker spaces (communities of practice, usually centered around a physical space), and makers (a personal identity).\nIn addition to offering a concise history of the maker movement, its roots, and concerns and questions that have arisen around it, Halverson and Sheridan discuss the tensions associated with bringing maker concepts and activities into schools.\n\"Bringing the maker movement into the education conversation has the potential to transform how we understand 'what counts' as learning, as a learner, and as a learning environment,\" they write.\nAt the same time, however, \"perhaps the greatest challenge to embracing the maker movement in K-12 schools ... is the need"}

Diet is only one aspect of cancer risk.\"\nOn Monday, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer released a report stating that there is now enough scientific evidence to conclude that eating processed meat causes colon cancer.\nAccording to the agency, each 50g portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colon cancer by 18 per cent. Red meat, such as beef, pork and lamb, was classified as \"probably carcinogenic\".\nThis announcement was not surprising, pointed out Dr Raymond Ng, a senior consultant medical oncologist at the National Cancer Centre Singapore.\n\"The information is not new as we have always acknowledged that processed food is not healthy,\" he said, stressing that there are several causes of cancer.\nPart of the reason why processed meats is believed to cause cancer is because they contain nitrates, usually used as a preservative.\n\"We know there are carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) in preservatives,\" said oncologist Ang Peng Tiam, medical director of Parkway Cancer Centre. \"But the real impact on cancer is questionable.\"\nIn Singapore, colon cancer is the most common cancer among men, and the second-most common for women. It is also among the top three causes of cancer death for both sexes. From 2010 to last year, 9,324 new cases of colon cancer were diagnosed.\nThe Health Promotion Board said that the average adult Singaporean consumes about 10g of processed meat a day, around the equivalent of half a hot dog.\nThe key message, say experts, is moderation. \"It is always a good idea to keep consumption of processed food to a minimum,\" Dr Ng said.\nAdded dietician Derrick Ong of Eat Right Nutrition Consultancy: \"Processed meats are very high in sodium, and that's also been linked to a higher risk of hypertension.\""}

{"idx": "10322", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The moment your head starts operating in chaos mode is the moment you need to pause and reset.\nIf you\u2019re a business owner, chances are you\u2019re always busy. You\u2019re multitasking, working long hours, and you worry that if you slow down, you\u2019ll never get everything done. But research has proven that task-switching make us less efficient\u2013not more. This kind of behavior can account for up to a 40% loss in your productive time.\nSo when you\u2019re already overwhelmed with too much to do, how do you switch out of the unproductive, multitasking habit into a zone where you\u2019re focused and getting more done? The answer is counterintuitive but straightforward: You take breaks.\nWhen you take breaks the right way, you escape the spiral of constant busyness, refocus your attention, and get more done in less time. If you\u2019re someone who continually faces interruptions or gets pulled into last-minute meetings, taking regular breaks will help you even more.\nThe first thing to do when you\u2019re overwhelmed with work is to remind yourself that a quick break will help you get more done. You\u2019re not going to get much done from operating when your head feels like a tornado, but you can (and will) regain your focus when you press the reset button.\nThe next thing you need to do is take a pause. Take your hands off the keyboard, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. Give yourself at least 30 seconds, but five minutes is even better. Your brain will tell you that you can\u2019t stop, but you can\u2013and must. Because when you get back to work, you\u2019ll quickly make up for the break time with increased productivity.\nThe concept is pretty simple: When you work, you work, and when you take a break, you stop. The key to clearing out the internal noise is to pause and physically take yourself out of chaos mode. Once you feel re-centered (and don\u2019t cut yourself short here, or the break won\u2019t serve you), ask yourself what needs your attention most right now. Think about where your time and energy need to go next and be deliberate about what you\u2019re going to do next.\nTo make taking breaks a habit, you need to determine your break triggers. The first trigger is obvious and one that all business owners probably know well: internal chaos. Your head is spinning with a million things that you need to do, your team members\u2019 requests for your input, and that looming deadline. The crazier you feel inside, the more you need a break, and the more a break will help you refocus and get it all done.\nBut you also need to set other triggers yourself, preferably corresponding with things that happen throughout your day. It can be when you finish a phone call, before you start a new task, or after someone interrupts you with an impromptu meeting. When these triggers occur, pause for a few moments before diving back into work.\nTaking breaks in these pre-planned moments helps you recenter, refocus, and get ready for the next task. Doing so will help you get more done in less time because the quick break sets you up to give 100% of your attention to the next task at hand.\nOnce you have the basics of taking breaks down, you\u2019re ready to amp up your productivity by planning your day (and your downtime.) Do you want to take a half-hour, non-working lunch every day? Do you want to stop mid-morning and get a latte at your favorite coffee shop? Do you want to fit in an afternoon walk or run?

Boone Pickens was right, or almost right, when he said the money the U.S. has paid to foreign nations for oil amounts to the greatest transfer of wealth in human history, he said.\n\u201cWith abundant sources of nuclear-generated electricity, I\u2019m convinced that American ingenuity would very quickly find ways to convert manufacturing industries and vehicles that now operate on oil to operate on electric power,\u201d Ferguson said in his book.\nBut a larger concern for Ferguson and his motivation for suing Obama was the president\u2019s flouting the rule of law, he said. Obama\u2019s move to shut down work on Yucca Mountain violated his oath of office to execute the law as outlined in the Constitution. Congress named Yucca Mountain as the nation\u2019s nuclear repository and only Congress has the power to change or repeal laws.\nThe lawsuit led to the release of the NRC safety report on Yucca Mountain last month. It found the repository was capable of containing used fuel and nuclear defense waste, including waste from Hanford, far into the future.\nBut the nation\u2019s lack of a repository has more to do with politics, than safety, Ferguson said. He blames to Obama and outgoing Senate majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada.\nObama allied himself with Reid and other powerful insiders, Ferguson writes. Reid, who has long opposed a national waste repository in his state, succeeded in getting his staff member Gregory Jaczko onto the NRC, where Jaczko would become chairman and get the technical license review of the repository shut down, according to the book.\nFerguson now recommends that Yucca Mountain be licensed as planned, but the decision to construct it be delayed until an incentive package for Nevada is worked out. He also supports creating large, temporary storage facilities for the waste, among other new policies to allow defense and commercial nuclear waste programs to move forward without unnecessary costs.\nHis latest book is a followup to his 2012 book, The Cost of Deceit and Delay, which focused on disposal of Hanford and other weapons waste. Ferguson self-published both books."}

Civil servants are now set to be called in front of an influential committee of MPs to justify the spending.\nThe Government\u2019s overseas aid budget has grown in recent years as ministers have sought to meet a commitment in the Coalition agreement to spend 0.7 per cent of Gross Domestic Product on developing countries from 2013.\nThe Coalition commitment meant that the Department for International Development (Dfid) had to spend \u00a311.46billion on aid projects in 2013, according to accountants at the National Audit Office, which monitors spending on behalf of MPs, in a report published on Friday.\nHow do you spend \u00a33.7bn in just 8 weeks?\nTrue or false: who really gets British foreign aid?\nIn June 2013, Dfid officials were forecasting that they would have to spend \u00a32.7billion in November and December to hit the target. However, months later they found that they had to spend at an extra \u00a31billion - \u00a33.7billion \u2013 to hit the 0.7 per cent target.\nThe NAO report concluded that the short-term need to increase spending that year meant that was a risk the money was not spend efficiently.\nIt said: \u201cGiven the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013. It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending\u201d.\nThe problem was caused by officials wrestling with different accounting year ends for the department and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which monitors aid spending internationally by countries, the NAO said.\nAnother complication was the fact that the 0.7 per cent aid figure can increase or decrease during the year depending on the size of the British economy.\nThe MP leading a Commons investigation of aid spending warned that it would be counter-productive if meeting the target led to \"unreasonable and unrealistic demands\" that resulted in taxpayers' cash being used less effectively.\nSir Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat chairman of the international development select committee which will consider the report, said it opened the temptation to divert a bigger share of the budget to big global bodies rather than direct aid.\nSir Malcolm said that while it was important governments were not allowed \"off the hook\", his committee was keen to find ways to prevent repeats of the sudden spurts of spending.\nThe Government said that of its Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) spending was \u201csubject to a rigorous value for money assessment\u201d.\nA Dfid spokesman said: \u201cDfid was able to use this additional money to increase urgent humanitarian support, particularly in Syria and the Philippines, as well as providing additional funding to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria and the World Bank.\nThe NAO found no evidence that the Department failed to follow its normal business processes.\nShe added: \u201cDfid sets a clear strategy each year to deliver its ODA target and works with HMT to monitor and manage this through the year.

It also used them to justify recent missile strikes against Syrian President Bashar Assad's military bases.\n\"It reminds me of the events in 2003 when U.S. envoys to the Security Council were demonstrating what they said were chemical weapons found in Iraq,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday, in response to U.S. agencies blaming Syria's government for using chemical weapons. \"We have seen it all already.\"\nThe Bush administration used false intelligence reports that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some lawmakers and pundits, however, accused the Bush administration \u2014 not the intelligence community \u2014 of exaggerating the reports.\nTrump used the same rationale in December to question intelligence reports that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" he said.\nTrump later supported WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's statements claiming that Russia did not help WikiLeaks.\nTrump has also accused intelligence agencies of leaking information about his associates' connections to Moscow, and blamed them for allowing an unverified dossier to be leaked. But he also blamed the media for the rift between him and the intelligence communities.\nTrump's rocky relationship with his own intelligence community has seemingly come back to bite him, as the Russian government has taken to using his own words to respond to US accusations. It's also not the first time the tactic has been used. On the campaign trail, Trump cited a fake news story about a terror attack in Turkey, repeatedly questioned the credibility of the US electoral process, and dismissed hacking attempts of the Democrats attributed to Russia \u2014 themes that were often echoed by Russian media.\n\"Part of the reason active measures have worked in this U.S. election is because the commander-in-chief has used Russian active measures, at times, against his opponents,\" Clint Watts, a former FBI agent who has researched Russian information warfare, told the Senate recently.\nThe U.S. has accused Russia of knowing about the chemical weapons attack and trying to cover it up. At the same time, Putin alleged that the U.S. framed Assad, and that the U.S. is planning more \"false flag\" chemical attacks in the suburbs of Damascus.\nStill, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there could be \"no doubt\" that Assad's troops were behind the attack, and autopsies have showed that sarin gas was used.\nRussia has instead argued that the Syrian air force carried out a conventional attack that hit a chemical weapons cache controlled by the rebels. However, as chemical weapons expert Dan Kaszeta told Bellingcat, sarin in storage consists of unmixed components, and dropping a bomb on them would not turn them into a nerve agent.\n\"It is an infantile argument,\" he wrote.\nMeanwhile, Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. would not intervene further in Syria, while Putin said that relations with the Trump administration have \"degraded.\""}

It was a fight to the death -- literally. After more than a decade of triumphs and misfires, massive financial losses and continuing struggles, both succumbed, replaced last year by the merger of the two, The CW. But despite their downfall, The WB and UPN left a lasting effect on popular culture and the TV landscape with landmark series such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Gilmore Girls.\" The tale of the acrimonious and often comical rivalry between the networks is explored in \"Season Finale: The Unexpected Rise and Fall of The WB and UPN,\" by former WB executive Susanne Daniels and veteran entertainment journalist Cynthia Littleton. The book, released last week, pivots between insider memoir -- Daniels' chronicle of being on the front lines of The WB's launch -- and a more objective account by Littleton of UPN's highs and lows. In \"Season Finale,\" the professional ambitions of the executives from both networks trying to reach a youthful, underserved viewership are interspersed with juicy anecdotes behind hits (\"Buffy,\" \"7th Heaven,\" \"Star Trek: Voyager\" and \"Felicity\") and misses (\"The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,\" \"Birds of Prey,\" \"Kevin Hill\"). \"Our motivation was to document a moment in media history that will never happen again,\" said Littleton, deputy editor of news development at Variety, noting the growing influence of vertical integration, cable networks and the Internet. \"A lot of the shows were signature shows of their era. Their legacy is greater than their audience.\" Added Daniels, now the entertainment president of Lifetime Television: \"There's no denying that both networks changed the face of television.\" In the process, egos clashed, reputations were bruised, stars were made. Sarah Michelle Gellar almost became a supporting cast member of \"Buffy\" instead of the star. Keri Russell's untimely cutting of her trademark curly locks hurt the popularity of \"Felicity.\" The defection of \"Buffy\" from The WB to UPN after a furious dispute between WB head Jamie Kellner and the show's studio, 20th Century Fox, may have struck a lethal blow to The WB. \"Season Finale\" is more than a little bittersweet for Daniels. \"It was very intense and cathartic to go back to those times,\" she said. \"It was a lot more emotional for me than intellectual. Everything we worked so hard for was jettisoned for The CW.\" She chronicles her meltdown after a 2001 WB presentation for advertisers.

Here at the Fleury-Merogis prison \u2014 where Amedy Coulibaly did time alongside another of the attackers in the deadly assaults this month in and around Paris \u2014 authorities are struggling to quell a problem that they say was long threatening to explode.\nFormer inmates, imams and guards all describe a chaotic scene inside these concrete walls, 15 miles from the elegant boulevards surrounding the Eiffel Tower. Militancy lurks in the shadows, and the best-behaved men are sometimes the most dangerous. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls promised last week to flood his nation\u2019s prisons with 60 more Muslim chaplains, doubling their budget to try to combat radicalization. Authorities this week raided 80 prison cells of suspected radicals, saying they found cellphones, USB drives and other contraband. Hundreds of inmates in French prisons are a potential threat, authorities say.\nBut critics say that these efforts are minuscule compared with the scope of the problem, with prisons so poorly controlled that a leaked French government report once described Osama bin Laden posters hanging on inmates\u2019 walls.

Most prisoners spend up to nine hours a day mingling relatively unsupervised, guards say, first at work and then in the prison yard. French intelligence services pride themselves for their penetration of militant networks in their country \u2014 but prisons fall under a different umbrella, experts say, in which many radicals go unchecked, and even unnoticed, by guards.\nOther nations, including the United States and Britain, have also struggled with radicalization in prisons. But the issue has proved especially volatile in France, where experts estimate that Muslims make up more than half of the country\u2019s 68,000 inmates even though they are only 5 to 10 percent of the general population. But there are only about 170 imams currently ministering inside prisons.\n\u201cThe number of people who work on intelligence within prisons is peanuts,\u201d said Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at Paris\u2019s School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences who has studied prison radicalization.

The ones who do, potentially drawing guards\u2019 attention, are usually the ones who are harmless, he said.\nPrison guards, who are each typically responsible for 100 inmates, say they are able to do little about the problem.\n\u201cThey adapt faster than we do,\u201d said David Dulondel, who works as a guard"}

Emotions were running high.\nThe crowd surged in to enclose them, and they immediately went into a sort of mobile defensive crouch, keeping in a tight circular formation with their gunbarrels out covering a 360-degree horizon, and backing slowly down the street, looking tense and scared.\nEventually, several cooler heads, all of them Iraqi -- and, in particular, an old man who said his name was Fa'iz, who had the look of authority, with a white turban and a long flowing white beard and handlebar moustache -- gently shooed away the gawking children, quietly urged the angry Iraqis to back up, and lightly persuaded the soldiers to consider their best interest and not linger.\nSo this is what freedom looks like to Iraqis -- the freedom to preach about kicking out the infidel invaders and running their own country. From an American point of view, it certainly wasn't pretty.\nBut that's the way of freedom -- once you unleash it, it can be hard to control, and dangerous to try.\nThora has become dangerous.

They said the bi-state region needs not one, but two, toll-free U.S. 41 bridges left in service.\nBob Koch, CEO of Koch Enterprises, said about 500 employees of his companies traverse the bridge to and from work.\nKoch, who also is president of the bi-state I-69 bridge advocacy coalition BridgeLink, said there are ways the project team can cut the long-term maintenance costs on the U.S. 41 bridges.\n\"Place a weight limit on the twin bridges and direct all medium and heavy trucks to the new, tolled bridge,\" Koch said. \"There\u2019s more than enough money to take care of the I-69 bridge and to keep the two existing bridges free of tolls.\"\nKoch was followed to the microphone by Sara Miller, president of the Old National Bank Evansville region; Berry Global CEO Tom Salmon; former Deaconess Health System CEO Linda White; Southwest Indiana Chamber Board President Christine Keck; Brad Ellsworth, president of Vectren South and board president of Growth Alliance for Greater Evansville; and others.\nWhite noted the volume of patients Deaconess facilities has from Kentucky communities, as well as the recently announced partnership between Deaconess and Henderson's Methodist Hospital.\nMiller said Old National \"benefits from a diverse and regional workforce, and we need to provide toll-free access to communities where they live and serve.\"\nDuring Monday night's public hearing in Henderson, the project team heard many similar comments.\nIt remains to the be seen how the project team will react to what it heard during the hearings.

And it's in these parts that the blowing dirt of the 1930s caused some in the heart of the Dust Bowl to move away.\nOn Black Sunday in 1935, a man climbed to the top of the Rolla water tower and took a picture of the billowing cloud of dust that was heading toward town. He then sent it to the president of the United States, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum.\n\"Dear Mr. Roosevelt, Darkness came when it hit us. Picture taken from the water tower one hundred feet high. Yours Truly, Chas P. Williams.\"\nThat, however, was more than 75 years ago.\nThere are few dark days in Rolla, except when an occasional storm cloud rolls in. Moreover, folks here are investing in growth, says Lee, the county's economic development director.\nMorton County resident David Light donated 10 lots inside the Rolla city limits a few years back to give away free to anyone who would build a home there. Then he went to the bank and asked officials to set aside $1 million in financing.\nMeanwhile, the county commission extended its tax increment financing to include new homes, Lee said.\nThe effort is comparable to what a few other communities across Kansas are trying - luring residents to town with free land if they build and maintain their property. It also, in essence, echoes the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered pioneers ownership of a quarter section if they improved the land.\nThe goal is to attract residents and businesses to rural communities in an effort to boost population and support small-town businesses and schools.\nCity officials now have one taker, Lee said. The new home being built by Jason Larue, a Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent, and his family, is 30 days from competition.\n\"We have nine lots left,\" Lee said. \"It has been so exciting. I know other small communities have given away land, but I didn't know how successful it would be for us.\"\nThe venture could also help sustain the town's Class 1A school, she added.\nRolla is not the only town in the county benefiting from rural reinvestment. Morton County took advantage of Gov. Sam Brownback's Rural Opportunity Zone program that helps repay student loans to those who move into a designated county.

Colors that offset such flooring chiefly depend on the oak itself. Oak species, like any wood, vary in tone, and the lightest of these range from nearly white and honey-tone to light gray and even subtle pink. Your low- or high-contrasting color options vary as much if not more than the wood tones themselves.\nHoney-colored oak tends to read as warm yellowy gold. To temper the warmth and provide high contrast, look across the color wheel to blue. Color opposites balance each other; your wall paint options include anything from steel blue to sky blue to bluebell. If you would prefer to incorporate blue in a different way, use a blue stain on a few wood furnishings or opt for pops of bright-blue accessories, then go with a vaguely contrasting, lighter honey tone on the walls.\nLight or white oak with a gray or weathered tone plays well with bright, fresh hues. Celery green, sunny yellow or orange bring life to grayish floors. If you prefer mellower contrast, freshen up gray flooring with plenty of whites throughout.\nWhite floors provide the most versatility when adding color. If a dark, dramatic scheme appeals to you, pair your nearly white hardwood with black walls -- they aren\u2019t as in-your-face as you might think. Dark shades tend to recede and allow light colors to come forward. Layer your dark walls with white window treatments and pale-colored art to play into the flooring. If white walls are more your thing, opt for plenty of contrasting black elements throughout. It doesn't matter that your \"white\" floors aren't actually \"white;\" the threefold coloring provides layered interest.\nLight oak flooring with a whitewashed or pickled finish sometimes reads as subtly pink or salmon. Seek dark, dramatic contrast for an edgy design. On the walls, avoid additional warm shades of burgundy, Merlot, rust or burnt orange in favor of cooler, bittersweet chocolate, espresso or charcoal, if you want to neutralize the pink underfoot. Light brown -- void of pink undertones -- or silvery gray provide \u201cquieter\u201d or slighter contrast. Dot a restful bedroom with accessories of complementary turquoise.

But this decision was a terrible mistake,\" says the Wisconsin senator. \"Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue, the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president. Ignoring important principles of judicial restraint and respect for precedent, the Court has given corporate money a breathtaking new role in federal campaigns. Just six years ago, the Court said that the prohibition on corporations and unions dipping into their treasuries to influence campaigns was \u2018firmly embedded in our law.\u2019 Yet this Court has just upended that prohibition, and a century\u2019s worth of campaign finance law designed to stem corruption in government. The American people will pay dearly for this decision when, more than ever, their voices are drowned out by corporate spending in our federal elections. In the coming weeks, I will work with my colleagues to pass legislation restoring as many of the critical restraints on corporate control of our elections as possible.\"\nWhen all is said and done, however, that may not be enough.\n\"All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law,\" said Roosevelt in the first years of the 20th century, when he was also proposing public financing of federal election.\nThe court\u2019s ruling in the case of Citizens United v.

As the title suggests, Fathallah analyses fan communities and their traversing patterns online. Specifically, the scholar identifies patterns where fan fictions orbit mainstream and cult television properties including The CW's Supernatural, BBC's Sherlock, and HBO's Game of Thrones. The texts are selected based upon researcher familiarity, but the artifacts also contain highly active fan communities. Meeting the tenets of what Henry Jenkins dubbed participatory culture, the author employs online ethnographic data collection while rigorously coding patterns that emerge over time. Rather than cherry-picking from outlier comments or fan behaviors, Fathallah effectively identifies patterns of significance that arise from the text (think episodic genre conventions) and the paratext (innovations provided by fan fictions that circulate online).\nFanfiction and the Author dskews toward academic audiences, but unlike many frothy offerings from the Ivory Tower, this work never tries on the insular trope of its contemporaries' ring-kissing. Indeed, there's plenty for fans of these texts to devour. The author writes from personal experiences, as fan, and her personal passion for the subject matter will no doubt tap into designated fan factions familiar with the literary/televisual series dissected under Fathallah's scholarly lens.\nIn terms of research grit, the author-scholar utilizes a mixed methods approach, which strengthens her overall assessment. Earlier pages suggest this work intends to draw heavily from vanguard postmodernist Michel Foucault. Fortunately, Fathallah steadies a relatable and digestible understanding of Foucault's contributions to discourse analysis. The researcher combines an assessment of discourse analysis with taut reviews of Internet Studies and Fan Studies. As a trained academic, her work is robust and impressive. Delving through the research references will be a treat to grad students and faculty readers alike. Fathallah remixes old and new sources that showcase a quality of fit between the author and her subject. In effect, she's practicing meta-genre mixing in textual and mixed methods form.\nSome of the strongest articulations come from Fathallah's close reading (and subsequent coding) of the texts themselves. For example, the researcher frames a shared understanding of masculinity in Sherlock by isolating recurrent themes of mind, body, position, and place (53-64). She then juxtaposes these textual patterns (considered canon) against those re-appropriated by fan communities, primarily through the creation and circulation of alternate narratives collectively identified as fan fiction (fanfic). The results spotlight how mainstream texts that skew toward heteronormative white male modes of power and privilege come to bend based upon alternative readings.\nThese textual renderings blur concepts of \"canon\" and provide contrary interpretations that extend narrative potentialities. Such a negotiated framework extends textual meaning whereby previous heteronormative standards hazily reject or limit alternative readings invitational to dialogic meanings"}

{"idx": "10357", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If you're an athlete who throws, pitches or passes, stretching isn\u2019t optional; it's an essential part of your training program. Stretching is vital for maintaining or improving joint mobility, increasing throwing power and reducing the risk of sports-related injury. When you stretch before a game or practice, opt for dynamic, or movement-based, stretches. Save static exercises for later, when your muscles are already warm, supple and more receptive to stretching.\nThe goal of dynamic stretching is to prepare your throwing arm, shoulders and trunk for more strenuous activity. After a 10-minute warm-up to raise your body temperature and increase blood flow, complete several sets of dynamic stretches. Circle your arms forward and backward to loosen up your shoulders, and circle your head slowly in both directions to release tension from your neck. Open and close your arms across the front of your body to stretch out your chest and upper back. Rotate your torso from side to side to warm up your obliques. Clasp your hands together in front of you and slowly rotate your hands to the right, and then to the left. Complete 10 to 15 repetitions of every exercise.\nTo stretch your triceps and surrounding muscles, stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart with your knees slightly bent. Bend your right elbow and direct it upward, allowing your right hand to fall behind your head. Grasp the elbow with your left hand and gently press the back of your head against your right forearm to achieve a stretch in the under-arm area. Hold for up to 30 seconds. Release briefly, and then pull the elbow gently to the left. Hold for 30 seconds. Increase the area of stretch by leaning your upper body slightly to the left while continuing to pull downward on the elbow. You should feel a lengthening sensation along the entire right side of your torso. Hold the position for up to 30 seconds, and then repeat the series on the left side.\nTo target the shoulders, chest and arms, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your knees slightly bent. Stand with a straight back, press your shoulders down and slightly back and extend your arms behind you. Clasp your fingers together, straighten your elbows and slowly rotate the elbows inward, pinching your shoulder blades together. If you feel a stretch, hold for 30 seconds. If you don't, intensify the exercise by slowly raising your clasped hands upward. Allow your chest to expand, but keep the top of your head level and avoid jutting your chin forward. Hold the stretch for up to 30 seconds.\nLoosen up your wrists, hands and fingers with a series of stretches. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your shoulders down and slightly back. Extend your right arm in front of your chest with your palm facing away from you and your fingers directed upward. Grasp the fingers of your right hand with the fingers of your left hand and gently pull back toward your chest. When you feel a light stretch in the wrist, hold for up to 30 seconds. Direct the fingers downward and repeat the gentle pull toward your chest. Hold for 30 seconds, and then release. Slowly expand the fingers of your right hand, separating the fingers as much as possible, and then close the fingers into a light fist. Repeat 10 to 15 times, and then switch to your left arm and repeat the series.\nThrowing can take a toll on your lower body, so don't neglect your quads, hamstrings, glutes, groin, hip flexors, calves and ankles. Include appropriate lower-body stretches"}

Well, it changes all the time. 'Set a debt-free date?' You don't have a crystal ball. 'Create a budget?' Ha!\nCompared with your salaried friends, your road to a debt-free life might be particularly long and winding \" but it's still a journey worth making. These strategies can smooth your way.\nWith credit card debt, making at least the minimum payments on time each month is a must. But you don't have to wait until it's due to pay.\nBut don't stop there. Making additional payments throughout the month as your income comes in will bring down those balances faster. And if you have good or excellent credit, look at moving your debt to a card with an introductory 0% balance transfer APR period to save on interest charges.\nWhile Lydia Senn was paying off $13,000 of credit card debt on an irregular income in 2011 and 2012, her approach to budgeting was simple: Make a plan based on the smallest paychecks.\n'We estimated, kind of going off the idea, 'Well, what if I don't have any freelance work this month? And what if there's no overtime?'' says Senn, founder of the personal finance blog Frugal, Debt Free Life. She lives in Mobile, Alabama, with her husband and kids.\nWhile paying off credit card debt, she was working as a freelancer and pregnant with her first child; her husband was working on an hourly wage as a civil land surveyor. This essentials-only budget helped them pay down their total consumer debt of $36,000 (including $13,000 of credit card debt) in about two years.\nWhile tackling her household's credit card debt, Senn always paid at least $200 more than the credit card minimums. But some months, she was able to pay more.\n'Whenever I got more freelance income, whenever there was a bonus or overtime or anything like that, all of the extra would go in [toward paying off credit card debt],' she says.\nYou can use extra funds to pay down your debt faster, too. It doesn't require winning the lottery or inheriting a fortune. If you earn more than expected in a given month \" perhaps because of a big tax refund, a birthday check from a family member or hours of overtime \" that cash can help you get rid of that credit card debt faster.\nFor Rachel Carlson, of Seattle, planning as far ahead as possible makes it significantly easier to pay down debt on an unpredictable income.\nBy noting when bills are due and when paychecks from her jobs are expected to come in, she can more easily estimate how much she can afford to put toward her debt each month. Recently, for example, she got a stipend of $800 for a play she directed, and because she knew her income from other projects would cover her basic expenses, she put the full amount toward her credit card debt.\nFor self-employed workers, like Carlson, an irregular income comes with the territory. But often, there's also another challenge: knowing what to charge clients.\n'For the first year, year-and-a-half of my teaching artist career, I really low-balled myself and didn't put"}

The encounter was forever immortalized in an intriguing photo, which enhances the enigma around this bizarre Saturnian moon.\n\u201cTitan is a fascinating place that really teases us with some of its mysteries,\u201d said Elizabeth Turtle, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.\nAs the Inquisitr previously reported, the 3,200-mile-wide moon \u2014 which is half as big as Earth\u2019s moon and ranks among the largest natural satellites of the solar system \u2014 is shrouded in a hazy atmosphere that conceals its surface features, hiding them from our sight.\nBut in this last snapshot of Titan, Cassini has managed to peer through the moon\u2019s atmosphere and capture a unique view of its north pole.\nAccording to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which designed and built Cassini, the image reveals an important clue about the moon\u2019s atmosphere, pointing to an unexpected difference between the southern and the northern summer on Titan.\nTaken on September 11, 2017, by Cassini\u2019s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) \u2014 specifically its narrow-angle camera, sensitive to near-infrared wavelengths \u2014 the photo showcases Titan\u2019s northern seas and lakes.\nUnlike the ones found on Earth, the seas and lakes on Titan are filled with liquid hydrocarbons, mainly methane and ethane, the Inquisitr reported last year, shortly after the Cassini mission ended in a literal blaze of glory on September 15, 2017.\n\u201cCassini\u2019s final image of the mysterious moon\u2019s northern lakes and seas leaves us with more questions than answers,\u201d JPL wrote on Twitter on September 13.\nThe left side of the photo is dominated by Kraken Mare, the largest known body of liquid on Titan. Named after the legendary sea monster, Kraken Mare stretches for 730 miles (1,200 kilometers) and is believed to be larger than the Caspian Sea on Earth.\nThe center of the photo is occupied by Titan\u2019s other two large methane seas, the 240-mile-wide (390 kilometers) Punga Mare and the slightly bigger Ligeia Mare, which measures 300 miles (500 kilometers) across.\nThese are not the same maria seen on Earth\u2019s moon, which earned their moniker after initially being mistaken for actual seas. Closer to home, lunar maria actually represent dark volcanic plains, the Inquisitr recently reported.\nThe left side of the Cassini photo is populated by numerous methane lakes, which are fed liquid hydrocarbons by rainfall and underground streams, notes JPL.\nBut while methane seas and lakes certainly make for a captivating sight, the striking thing about this Cassini image is a small detail that speaks volumes about the Titan\u2019s weather.\nCaptured from a distance of nearly 87,000 miles (140,000 kilometers) from Titan, the photo shows a few small clouds between Punga Mare and Ligeia Mare.

Data from the study is expected sometime in the first half of this year.\nImmunoGen&apos;s chief medical officer, Anna Berkenblit, talked about the encouraging data for IMGN779 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and plans for the drug: \"Encouragingly, in data presented at ASH, we saw anti-leukemia activity in more than 40% of relapsed/refractory patients. This year, we expect to establish the recommended phase 1 dosing schedule for IMGN779 to move forward within combination regimens in AML.\"\nBerkenblit also went over expectations for the Forward 1 study: \"We have designed the study looking for PFS improvement from three and a half months in the control arm to six months in the experimental arm, which translates into a hazard ratio of 0.58.\"\nHere&apos;s a quick lesson in clinical-trial lingo if you need it: PFS is \"progression-free survival,\" or the time it takes for a patient&apos;s tumor to begin growing again while the patient remains alive. Hazard ratio is a statistical measure of the differences between the two groups (arms) of the study; a 0.58 hazard ratio translates into a 42% improvement for mirvetuximab over the control arm of the study, where the patients receive chemotherapy.\nOn the potential for the drug to improve survival, Berkenblit pointed out that \"the study is not powered to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. However, we would expect that all of the endpoints are consistent, and so we&apos;d expect to see a trend in overall survival in the right direction.\"\nManagement expects to end the year with between $135 million and $140 million in the bank.

Based on some of the images I've seen (top left), the volcano is throwing ballistic bombs over a large swath of the summit area. All of this is well within the typical activity at the volcano when it enters a significant eruptive event - and the Instituto Geofisica of Ecuador seems to think that the conduit for Tungurahua is open, with ready expulsion of ash and gas, so the threat of a large explosive event is diminished. Although the eruption (video) isn't directly hazardous to many right now, the Ecuadoran government has now banned tourists from visiting the vicinity of the volcano.\nThe Daily Mail posted a series of images of the current eruption (with a description of the eruption as producing \"lorry-sized boulders\" ... that left many Americans blinking I'm sure). You can try to catch your own glimpse of the activity in the IG webcams pointed at Tungurahua as well.\nFurther down the continent in Chile, Planch\u00f3n-Peteroa is still producing small ash plumes (see below) - some of which have been quite visible on the webcam pointed at the volcano. The Oficina Regional de Emergencia (ONEMI) in Chile has issued a Yellow Alert (video) for towns near the volcano after an increase in the ash emissions and seismicity. The SERNAGEOMIN's latest update on Planch\u00f3n-Peteroa (word document) mentions that the region of the volcano felt 405 earthquakes over the month of April, many of which were offset from the active crater by 25 km. The volcano did produce steam and gas plumes mixed with small (~1.2 km) ash plumes that deposited ash and lapilli on the SE and SW slopes of the volcano. Interestingly, the update says that the seismic activity is \"relatively stable\" with shallow hydrothermal system activity, \"the ash and gas emissions have increased to become almost continuous phenomenon, which may facilitate destabilization of the system.\" So, this seems like a situation well worth watching.\nThe active crater area at Chile's Planch\u00f3n-Peteroa as seen on April 30, 2011.

Martino and Lord Ismay.\nReaffirmation of Alliance's right to possess atomic weapons - Decision to intensify the effort to reunify Germany through free elections - Middle East Security.\nThe North Atlantic Council, presided over by Mr. Gaetano Martino, Foreign Minister of Italy, held its regular Ministerial meeting in Bonn on 2nd and 3rd May, 1957. The Secretary General, Lord Ismay, acted as Chairman of the Council's discussions.\nThe Atlantic Alliance has always been and remains purely defensive. It was created to protect its member countries from any aggression. lt has succeeded. But the danger of aggression clearly continues, and the countries of the Atlantic Alliance must therefore remain united to provide for their defence.\nThe Council noted that since its last meeting the Soviet leaders have launched a campaign which, while throwing the cloak of oblivion over Soviet repression in Hungary, is designed to induce public opinion in various member countries to oppose the modernization of defence forces, and to weaken the principle of collective security in NATO.\nThe Council agreed that one of the objects of this campaign was to ensure for Soviet forces a monopoly of nuclear weapons on the European continent. Such a situation clearly could not be accepted. It was with satisfaction that the Council noted the firm replies given to these Soviet maneuvers.\nThe Atlantic Alliance must be in a position to use all available means to meet any attack which might be launched against it. It is the availability of the most modern weapons of defence which will discourage attempts to launch any such attack on the Alliance. Pending an acceptable agreement on disarmament, no power can claim the right to deny to the Alliance the possession of the modern arms needed for its defence. If, however, the fears professed by the Soviet Union are sincere, they could be readily dissipated. All that is needed is for the Soviet Union to accept a general disarmament agreement embodying effective measures of control and inspection within the framework of the proposals made on numerous occasions by the Western powers, which remain an essential basis of their policy.\nDuring their discussions on the problem of security, the question was raised of the balance as between the latest weapons and conventional arms. The Council is awaiting the results of the studies now in hand by the NATO military authorities to enable member countries to decide together on the steps necessary for the development and balance of the different types of forces needed. The Council remains convinced that these decisions taken in common should take into account the need for NATO to retain an effective deterrent against aggression, including a powerful shield of land, sea and air forces, to protect the territory of member states.\nRecent events in Hungary have confirmed that freedom counts for nothing in Soviet eyes, and that the USSR is prepared to use force to crush the legitimate aspirations of nations. The Council agreed that the continued brutal repression of the struggle for freedom of the heroic Hungarian people remains, and continues to make difficult an improvement in East-West relations.\nThe Council discussed the effect of political developments in recent months on the question of German reunification. They decided to continue their efforts with every means at their disposal to induce the Soviet Government to carry out its agreement that Germany should be reunified by means of free elections. The Ministers view the prolonged division of Germany and the anomalous situation of Berlin as a continuing threat to world peace. They according]y reaffirmed their determination by peaceful means to continue and intensify the common policy for the restoration of Germany as a free and united state within the framework of a system of European security. They directed particular attention to the inhumanity of the continued division of the German people.\nThe Council reviewed recent developments in the Middle East."}

Putin, who had good ties with Ukraine's fiery ex-premier in the past, could hope for striking a deal with her that would safeguard Russian interests without the need to resort to force.\n\"If she consolidates power, Putin will be quite happy. They understand each other perfectly well,\" said Stanislav Belkovsky, a political consultant who advised the Kremlin and worked in Ukraine. \"He has good ties with Tymoshenko, and her triumph would suit him.\"\nTymoshenko, who comes from eastern Ukraine, could be an ideal peacemaker, restoring an uneasy balance between Ukraine's Russian-speaking east and south, and its western regions that abhor Russian influence.\nShe is burdened, however, by the legacy of insider deals and corruption allegations during her business and government careers, which may challenge her campaign. She also faces the tough task of winning the trust of some of the protesters, who are suspicious of old players and want fresh faces and strong action. And she will have to walk a fine line between publicly taking an anti-Kremlin posture to win votes in western regions and assuaging residents of the east that their interests will be protected.\nFor Putin, she could actually make a more convenient partner than the hesitant and indecisive Yanukovych, who had tried to maneuver between Russia and the West and provoked public anger by abruptly shelving a pact with the European Union in favor of a bailout from Moscow.\nRussia's state-controlled broadcasters heaped scorn on Yanukovych, casting him as a leader who was too weak to use force to establish order and betrayed police who had stood behind him. That's a clear sign the Kremlin sees him as a discarded asset.\nReports about Yanukovych hiding in the Crimea, which hosts Russia's naval base, could encourage some activists in Kiev and western Ukraine to pressure the government to apprehend him.

A breath test found that her blood-alcohol level was above the legal .08 limit and she was charged with an OUI. She then sought to suppress the results, arguing that she had a right to consult with an attorney before taking the test. The Supreme Judicial Court is scheduled to hear arguments on May 5.\nBreath tests need to be administered promptly in order to be effective. So any delay waiting for a lawyer to arrive at the scene or police station could allow the alcohol level to drop to below the legal limit and let a drunken driver dodge charges.\nCapeless\u2019 office argues that the SJC could put an \u201cundue delay\u201d on the administration of justice if it rules for Neary-French.\n\u201cThe creation of a new right advocated by the defendant will create tremendous strains on the judicial system,\u201d wrote Joseph Coliflores, a prosecutor with the Berkshire DA\u2019s office.\nUnder state law, motorists who refuse a breath test automatically lose their license for 180 days. One unresolved question would be how long authorities would have to wait for a lawyer before it\u2019s considered an outright refusal and cost drivers their licenses.\nShe argues in her brief that taking a breath test is akin to handing key evidence to authorities on a silver platter.\nNeary-French\u2019s argument stems from a 2003 change to the state\u2019s OUI law, which now considers a failed breath test to be direct evidence of intoxication. Quigley wrote that the rule makes the decision to take a breath test a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in the criminal process. And under state law, everyone has a right to an attorney at critical stages.\n\u201cThe defendant should be afforded an opportunity to consult with counsel before being administered a breath test to determine if the defendant should submit to the gathering of such evidence,\u201d Quigley wrote.\nNeary-French, in a brief chat with the Herald, said she understands how the case could change how breath tests are administered across the state. She declined to comment further, saying Quigley told her not to discuss the case with the media. Quigley did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nThe SJC asked for amicus briefs in February, but to date no one has stepped up to support either side."}

{"idx": "10388", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the month of April, 1877, a little band of Princetonians invaded Cambridge to play football with Harvard.\nOnly a few months before in Spring-field delegates from Columbia, Harvard, Princeton and Yale had assembled, formed the American Intercollegiate Football Association and adopted the Rugby Union Rules as their code of play. The playing field was marked off on Jarvis Field.\nHarvard had had three years' experience playing under the Rugby code, Princeton none. Fortunately for Princeton, however, there was among her undergraduates at the time a young Sophomore who was familiar with the Rugby game. This young Sophomore was elected a football director, \"coach\" we would say today, and participated in the coaching of that original Rugby team of Tigers. The name of that young Sophomore was Woodrow Wilson '79. Harvard won the initial game.\nIn those times fifteen players constituted a team, divided into forwards, half-back and backs. The ball was put in play in a \"serum\" and the whole game, in fact, was typical English Rugby. Harvard won that game.\nIn the autumn the two fifteens met again, this time on famous and fashionable old St. George's Cricket Ground in Hoboken, New Jersey. In this second encounter, Princeton won. In 1878, back Princeton came and met Harvard on Boston Common, Princeton again winning. The following year, 1879, Harvard again journeyed to Hoboken and again suffered defeat. During these three years the famous \"fifteen\" of Rugby tradition had been reduced to \"eleven,\" and the basic line of cleavage established which in time was to produce a distinctive American game.\nDistinguished men were bred upon those early Harvard-Princeton football fields. Their \"line-ups,\" as we would say today, contained the names of W. E. Russell of Massachusetts, Robert Winsor and George R. Sheldon, Lucius N. Littauer and Robert Bacon, bankers and statesmen, all in their time football men at Harvard. On the Princeton teams were Blair Lee, later a United States Senator from Maryland and John S. Harlan, later Attorney General of Porto Rico and member of the Inter-State Commerce Commission.\nTackles Once Known As \"Next-to-Ends\"\nIn 1880 began the radical and many changes that gave us our present game. An orderly possession of the ball by one side was originated thus bringing on the great feature of prearranged tactics and strategy. Numerical values were assigned to the scoring plays, 1 to a safety, 2 to a touchdown; 4 to a goal from try following touchdown; and 5 to a goal from the field. The positions were settled into seven forwards or rushers, a quarter-back, two half-backs and a full-back. The names of the line positions also began to appear, \"end,\" \"next-to-end,\" \"next-to-center\" and \"center.\"\nIt quickly was noticed that the \"next-to-end\" made more tackles than the other linesmen and so his name was changed first to tackler and finally to tackle. Likewise it was seen that the \"next-to-center\" guarded the center while the latter put the ball in play and so the \"next-to-center\" naturally became known as the guard. Signals were invented, sentences at first in which a name or first letter of a name indicated the play.

{"idx": "10389", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Michael Gove\u2019s education reforms have created a real and potentially irreversible momentum for change.\nYesterday was the last day to apply for anyone wanting to start a free school in 2013. In the first year, 24 of those applying succeeded. This year, 72 made it. For 2013, there are over 300 applications, and probably more than 100 will be approved.\nFree schools are new schools, within the state sector, but outside local authority control. They are set up by parents, teachers, charities. They run themselves, with government money. They are complementary to academies, which are conversions of existing state schools to a similar self-managing status. By Easter, it is predicted, for the first time more than half of secondary schools will be academies, rather than \u201cbog-standard\u201d comprehensives. By the end of the parliament, the process of conversion will be almost complete.\nThese developments are extremely important. A real and possibly irreversible change is taking place.\nFor nearly half a century, the pressure was the other way. When Margaret Thatcher became education secretary in 1970, she was strongly opposed to the abolition of grammar schools, and did not accept the comprehensive doctrine. Yet such was the power of the local authorities who, in those days, controlled schools, that she ended up almost unable to resist. When she came into office, there were 1,137 comprehensives in England and Wales. By the time she left, she had reluctantly approved 3,286 more. She managed to save only 94 grammar schools. Mrs Thatcher created more comprehensives than any other education secretary in history.\nToday, the tide has turned. Under Tony Blair, Labour edged away from the dogma of the local authority comprehensive. Academies spread. Some Labour ministers, notably Lord Adonis, were evangelical about the need to change. Ministers who basically disliked reform were unable to stop it. Ed Balls, like Mrs Thatcher in reverse, tried to stem the rising tide of educational freedom, but failed.\nWhen the Coalition was formed in 2010, David Cameron, who is strongly interested in the subject, made Michael Gove his Education Secretary, and free schools were legislated for. In the very early days, Mr Gove\u2019s position was wobbly. His officials fed him wrong statistics, for which he had to apologise in public. He seemed uneasy running a big department. It looked as if the educational establishment might get him in just the way that the NHS establishment is currently getting Andrew Lansley.\nBut because of prime ministerial backing, and because Mr Gove is a highly intelligent and resilient man who really believes in what he is trying to do, he survived. The academies and free schools programmes have broken through. And although Labour councils are generally hostile, Labour\u2019s national leadership does not dare to throw a spanner in the works. Obviously, it would like the Government to fail in all its endeavours, but it does not want blindly to defend the status quo ante. The current shadow secretary, Stephen Twigg, is taking a \u201cwhat matters is what works\u201d line. The Liberal Democrats, though probably even more hostile on the ground to school reform, accept the reforms as part of the Coalition deal. If all the main parties are now prepared to agree, however grudgingly, that state-funded schools should be able to run themselves, then the greatest single obstacle to good education in this country is crumbling.\nBy chance, one organisation that applied this week to open a free school is the National Autistic Society."}

In his letter to Berkshire shareholders last month, he called the equity participation a \"bonus.\"\nBack on September 23, the day Buffett's multi-billion dollar \"vote of confidence\" in Goldman was announced, shares of the firm closed at $125.05.

Or a football game where you have your back to the field? Me neither. Yet that's exactly what I did to my students until a colleague set me straight. And I've seen this in a lot of classrooms over the years, so now it's my turn to set others straight.\nThe problem is that because teachers assign students to small groups for certain activities, they have them sit in small groups during whole-group instruction too. Some students, as a result, go back and forth between craning their necks or contorting their torsos to see what's on the board and turning back around to record notes. Other students, meanwhile, don't even bother straining to see the board, and instead either space out or socialize--no matter how much teachers exhort them to pay attention.\nAnd if this seat shifting sounds like a hassle, rest assured the time it takes for students to re-orient their desks/chairs (less than 30 seconds once they get it down) or for you to pass out a few clipboards is more than worth the positive effect on student engagement. So if you're looking for a simple yet significant classroom change for the new year, make sure students never have their backs or sides to the action in your classroom just as you never do when you go to the show or a game."}

{"idx": "10398", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Can I Have 2 401(k) Plans at the Same Time?\nA 401(k) is the most popular type of retirement plan private-sector companies offer, so you may have several different 401(k) accounts over your working lifetime. Or, if you work multiple jobs, you might be offered 401(k) plans from more than one employer simultaneously. Is this allowable?\nThe short answerThe short answer is yes, you can have multiple 401(k) accounts at a time. In fact, it&apos;s rather common for people to have an old 401(k) account (or several) from their previous employer(s), in addition to their current one.\nAnother common situation is where individuals earn self-employment income in addition to income from their job. With self-employment income, these people can set up and contribute to an individual 401(k) even if they have another 401(k) at their job.\nOverall contribution limitsIf you have more than one active 401(k) account, you need to be aware that the IRS&apos;s contribution limit for elective deferrals refers to your combined 401(k) accounts.\nFor the 2016 tax year, you can choose to defer up to $18,000 of your pay into your 401(k) plan. If you have more than one 401(k), this limit applies to your total elective deferrals. For example, if you choose to contribute $15,000 to your primary employer&apos;s 401(k) plan, you would be limited to $3,000 in elective contributions to any other plans you participate in. Also, if you&apos;re over 50, you are allowed an additional $6,000 in catch-up 401(k) contributions for a total of $24,000.\nNote that this limit doesn&apos;t include any employer matching or nonelective contributions. So, if you max out your $18,000 elective deferral in your primary 401(k), an employer could still contribute into another 401(k) plan for your benefit. In fact, the total contribution limit including elective deferrals and employer contributions is $53,000 per 401(k) plan for 2016 ($59,000 if you&apos;re over 50), or 100% of compensation, whichever is less.\nYou can treat contributions to an individual 401(k) as nonelective (employer) contributions, so even if you&apos;ve contributed the $18,000 maximum to an employer&apos;s 401(k), you could still contribute up to $53,000 to your individual 401(k) as a nonelective contribution.\nRetirement planning considerationsJust because you might be able to keep your old 401(k) accounts in your old employer&apos;s plan, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s the smartest move. You should compare the investment options of each 401(k) plan, and the fees you&apos;re paying. If your old 401(k) has lower fees and you don&apos;t mind having your retirement savings in several places, by all means leave it alone. On the other hand"}

Ten million people actively use Pocket monthly as a mobile app or browser add-on, Mozilla said, with more than 3 billion pieces of content saved so far.\nThe app also lets people discover what others have already stored, an idea called discovery. It's a hot business on app stores, news sites, and other realms because middlemen can profit by showing content advertisers have paid to blend in. That's how 25-person Pocket makes money.\nPocket offers Mozilla a new way to pursue its mission of fostering a healthy diversity on the web even as we spend more of our time online within major centralized \"silos\" like Facebook. \"They layer on top of all the different silos out there,\" said Denelle Dixon-Thayer, Mozilla's chief business and legal officer. \"It creates openness in a way that historically wouldn't be there.\"\nPocket gives Mozilla a foothold on iPhones, iPads and competing mobile devices powered by Google's Android software. Hundreds of millions of people still use the Firefox browser, but Google's rival Chrome has now claimed the lion's share of users, and Firefox is all but absent on mobile devices. That's a problem for the nonprofit organization because mobile devices account for much of the increase in online activity, and indeed phones are only way many use the internet at all.\nThe Pocket activity is useful for another Mozilla initiative, Context Graph, a tool to recommend websites that people might find worth visiting based on what they and others view online.\nIt's Mozilla's first acquisition, but not its last if Dixon-Thayer gets her way. \"I would love to be able to grow our product portfolio,\" she said.\nMost people who use Pocket do so both with PC browsers and mobile apps, said Read It Later founder and Chief Executive Nate Weiner. A majority also use it for both saving and discovering content, he said.\nMozilla has for years included the Pocket add-on by default in Firefox, with Mozilla sharing a portion of revenue from the sponsored content in Pocket's discovery feature, Dixon-Thayer said. Mozilla and Read It Later declined to disclose terms of the acquisition.\nMozilla today gets the vast majority of its revenue from search engines -- especially Yahoo -- that can show ads when people use their browsers to search. Mozilla wants to diversify its revenue sources, though."}

Mark Warner have sought to raise a variety of taxes, including those on sales, cigarettes and income.\nAccording to an analysis by The Washington Times, a family of four earning $100,000 a year would pay $764.25 more each year under Mr. Warner\u2019s budget and $837.25 more under the Senate\u2019s plan.\nThe analysis assumes that all adults buy a pack of cigarettes a day and spend 10 percent of their annual income on items that fall under the state\u2019s current 4.5 percent sales tax. The analysis does not include deductions, exemptions and proposed reductions in the food tax.\nMr. Warner, a Democrat, has proposed raising $500 million a year by increasing the sales tax from 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent and the cigarette tax the nation\u2019s lowest from 2.5 cents per pack to 25 cents, as well as allowing an additional local tax of up to 50 cents per pack.\nThe governor also wants to create an income-tax bracket that would impose a 6.25 percent tax on households earning more than $100,000 a year. Currently, all taxpayers pay an income tax of 5.75 percent. Mr. Warner has said under his plan, 65 percent of Virginians would pay less in taxes.\nYesterday, Mr. Warner resubmitted his two-year, $59 billion budget as the General Assembly reconvened for a special session. He called for a special session on Tuesday after lawmakers did not produce a budget during their 60-day legislative session or three-day extension.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman John H. Chichester initially had proposed $2.5 billion in new taxes in a budget that would raise the sales tax to 5.5 percent and increase the cigarette tax to 35 cents per pack.\nThe Republican senator also sought to increase the income tax for the state\u2019s richest taxpayers, placing a 6.25 percent tax on incomes from $100,000 to $150,000 a year and a 6.5 percent tax on incomes of more than $150,000 a year.\nThe Senate and the House submitted new plans yesterday.\nSenate budget writers dropped a proposed 3.5 cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase but kept the proposed sales, income and cigarette taxes. Dropping the transportation component reduces the overall Senate two-year budget to about $60 billion still about $2 billion more than the House plan.\nMeanwhile, House budget writers endorsed a bill that would remove sales-tax exemptions on several sectors of major industry, including airlines, shipping, railroads and media revenue that was integral to the House\u2019s old $58 billion budget.\nBoth chambers adjourned last night and were expected to meet again today.\nUnder The Times\u2019 analysis, a single parent of two earning $20,000 a year would pay $102 more in new taxes under Mr. Warner\u2019s plan and $138 more under the Senate\u2019s plan.

{"idx": "10416", "prompt": "Continue the following text: On December 22, 2016, the Japanese Cabinet approved a record $44 billion (5.1 trillion yen) defence budget. This is seen as a response to the deteriorating security environment in the country\u2019s neighbourhood, in particular its perceived threats from its west. Japan is going to invest billions of dollars in new submarines, ships and stealth fighter aircraft, focusing on defending the Senkaku Islands, the chains in the East China Sea administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu. The planned acquisition of six submarines will be equipped with improved sensor technology and could face appropriately to the Chinese challenge.\nEven with a self-posed ceiling of keeping defence spending below 1 percent of the GDP, Japan possesses one of the most advanced naval capabilities. The present author had a rare experience of visiting DD Harusume, a Destroyer at Yokosuka Bay on 10 March 2011, and interacting with the Captain of the ship, a day before the great east Japan earthquake and the ship dispatched soon on rescue mission. The sight of a number of warships lined up at the Bay gave an impression how powerful the country\u2019s naval capability is. Equally impressive was a visit to the Hyakuri Air Base in Ibaraki Prefecture on 27 November 2016 and witness the demonstration of advanced air power and convinced that the country possesses a sophisticated strength of aircraft that could be lethal in the battle theatre. The very fact that over a million people witnessed this demonstration spread over the entire day also meant to develop a sense of patriotism among the people who could be sensitized at the time of national security crisis.\nThe mention of the above two experiences is to make a point that there would be a general acceptance by the people of Japan if the government opts for a greater defence spending. The people of Japan understand that the nation\u2019s security environment is fragile and though protected by the US under alliance relationship, would endorse greater preparedness by the country itself. The nation\u2019s confidence is also drawn from the experiences of World Wars. Indeed, with a vast coast line the country\u2019s submarine fleet with focus on specific mission seems to be its core strength. The acquisition of submarines is not a sudden process; the investment in this area started in the 1950s with focus on up-gradation of technology and procurement on continuous basis.\nJapan\u2019s grand strategy seems to be deterrence against China. Japan\u2019s intention is to show China through upgrades the high costs of missteps in order to prevent war. Currently, Japan has 17 diesel-electric submarines and plans to increase the fleet to 22 by around 2021. In comparison, China\u2019s submarine fleet consists of around 60 vessels, including nuclear-powered craft that can travel very long distances at high seas.\nEven the country\u2019s Coast Guard is being strengthened with emphasis to protect the Senkaku Islands because the site has seen repeated confrontations between Japanese and Chinese forces in recent times.

{"idx": "10420", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: FINAL APPROACH. By John J. Nance. (Crown, $19.95.) John J. Nance, a lawyer and a former airline pilot, has made something of a career cataloguing the flood of changes that airline deregulation has brought to the industry and the traveling public. His first book, \"Splash of Colors,\" depicted the bankruptcy of Braniff Airlines. \"Blind Trust,\" Mr. Nance's best-selling second book, argued that deregulation has led to an erosion of safety margins. Now, in his first novel, Mr. Nance offers a behind-the-scenes look at the political jockeying that follows the crash of an airliner on a rain-soaked runway in Kansas City, Mo. In particular, he dissects the workings of the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent Government agency that, he suggests, is not so independent after all. Politically hungry officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force and the fictional North America Airlines all try to sway the board's investigation. \"Final Approach\" is at its best as a gripping aeronautical whodunit. But the book seems overly ambitious, with a cumbersome plot that includes the possible assassination of a Congressman (a diversion Mr. Nance never fully resolves), a military cover-up and no fewer than two intra-office love affairs. The result is a sometimes turbulent read. Mr. Nance has gone to considerable pains to be technically accurate, and the novel occasionally bogs down in the fine points of flight-control systems or Federal rules that govern flying. But for the most part, \"Final Approach\" goes down smoothly, leaving readers something to chew on next time they board an airplane."}

{"idx": "10424", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: According to experts, personal memories from long ago of family and friends can link us together in shared comforts of tradition, and also lend a gratifying sense of continuity in our lives.\nNostalgia can take on many different forms. Watching an old black-and-white movie can trigger a cultural nostalgia for a lost period in time. Often that longing can predate one\u2019s own date of birth: fondness for a time only your parents may have known and talked about.\nThe mental journey back through time adds a fourth dimension to the present. If mindfulness is the focal point of the Eternal Now, nostalgia forms a special continuum to the timeless past, expanding our concept of the self. The future may be vague, inchoate and unpredictable; but the past represents a finished whole that cannot be harmed or tampered with.\nIt allows us to cast off the stresses of modern life by traveling back to a period of our own choosing. It\u2019s like escaping into the confines of a good book or a darkened theater, but in this case the story is real and (if chosen wisely) has been assured a happy ending.\nEspecially for the elderly, frequently isolated from loved ones and familiar surroundings, recapturing the past often results in maintaining a positive outlook and leads to purposeful activities, such as telling stories and sharing wisdom from a bygone time.\nThe emotion of nostalgia can be evoked from a familiar scent, an old photograph, or a cherished song. Often it occurs during periods of sadness or transition, but it can appear anytime \u2014 affecting the young as well as old. Even children as young as eight-years-old can experience the wistfulness of times past.\nHow nostalgic are you? The research of Krystine Batcho has led New Scientist to create a quiz on the subject, to determine one\u2018s degree of wistful thinking. A high score indicates a person more attuned to life and more adaptable to life\u2018s vicissitudes.\nThe healthy use of nostalgia is not about retreating into the past. On the contrary, exploring the treasures of our \u201cmental\u201d time capsules can propel us toward the future, with a restored sense of enthusiasm and hope. The regular practice of this discipline has been found to be correlated with increased resilience and self-confidence.\nFor some, nostalgia can come to resemble a spiritual meditation. Indeed, the past is more venerated in places where the future is more fleeting \u2014 where constant change is often expected and demanded. The \u201ccushion\u201d against future shock rests on the pillow of slow self-reflection. Such a spirit of languid repose opposes the current epoch, a time when the present is rooted in gross speed and frequent turmoil.\nThe judicious use of nostalgia offers each one of us who feels stranded in the present an anchor to the past.\nJohn DiPrete has contributed to Psych Central, MacWorld, Perceptual and Motor Skills, Medical Hypotheses, Speculations in Science and Technology, among other outlets.

He did this while talking about relations with the United States and the European Union, which have expressed concern about alleged extrajudicial killings in his drug war.\n\"Dialogue relations can be made more productive, constructive if the valued principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the ASEAN member-states is observed,\" Duterte said.\nDuterte had last year branded then US president Barack Obama a \"son of a whore\" for criticising the drug war, and more recently called European lawmakers \"crazies\" for issuing a statement condemning the killings.\nObservers said in the lead-up to the summit that ASEAN leaders were unlikely to criticise Duterte, with Human Rights Watch calling the bloc \"a club of cosy dictators or rights abusers\".\nAmong the heads of undemocratic regimes in Manila were Thai military junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha, Cambodia's Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge cadre, and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei."}

Twitter\u2019s monthly active user number stands at 328 million, exactly where it was three months ago. Even worse, the company lost 2 million monthly users in the high-spending United States, dropping from 70 million to 68 million. The growth surge responsible for much of the optimism \u2014 Twitter added approximately 9 million monthly users in the first quarter of 2017 \u2014 was exposed as a blip. \u201cLikely no more than a one-time gift,\u201d Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak advised in a note to investors.\nThough Twitter beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue and profitability expectations, user growth is critical because Twitter needs that growth to credibly challenge Google and Facebook, two giant internet companies that give marketers access to massive audiences, along with the ability to target with precision. \u201cIt just makes for a difficult investment,\u201d Aegis Capital Managing Director Victor Anthony told BuzzFeed News, after noting that Google and Facebook are going in the opposite direction, growing users and revenue.\nAnd the issues go on. Twitter still doesn\u2019t have a head of human resources at a time one would expect the position to be a priority, given the tech industry\u2019s recent scandals. It\u2019s also experiencing a talent exodus among executives critical to its revenue operation. Since February, Twitter\u2019s lost its partnerships VP Ali Jafari, Niche head Darren Lachtman, global content partnerships VP Ross Hoffman, and global brand and creative strategy VP Joel Lunenfeld.\nFor those looking for reasons to stay optimistic, there are some. Twitter\u2019s daily user count is growing. In a note, BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said the daily user count is \u201cthe most important metric in determining Twitter's revenue potential.\u201d And Twitter\u2019s finally named a new CFO after trying to find one for eight months.

Now superstar Rajinikanth, after contemplating on a political foray for more than two decades, has launched a new party that promises to fill the vacuum created by Jayalalithaa\u2019s death and Karunanidhi\u2019s retirement.\nRajinikanth holds the promise of stepping into the space vacated by the two former Tamil Nadu chief ministers because he is the biggest star of them all \u2013 if one goes by his iconic status in Indian cinema. The media celebrated his entry when he announced it on New Year\u2019s eve. But, sceptics wonder how far he will be able to convert his star value into votes.\nFrom a fan base point of view, Rajinikanth might be the biggest of the film stars to have entered southern politics, but he is unlikely to be another MGR, say political scientists. \u201cIt is totally unfair to compare Rajinikanth with MGR in terms of charisma, popularity or public life. As an actor, MGR never had commercial intentions and he never talked politics to promote cinema,\u201d said Manivannan, head, department of politics and public administration, University of Madras.\nMGR built an image as the messiah of the poor and marginalised sections. His humble background and nature as well as some of his schemes retained his popularity among the poor despite the corruption charges.\n\u201cRajini has never made his stand clear on the plight of farmers in the state. He has not taken a stand when several fishermen went missing recently. He has been silent when people were standing in queues post demonetisation. Working with fan clubs to promote cinema is not like working with people. Cinema itself has become a big corporate event,\u201d adds Manivannan.\nHowever, his charm cannot be fully dismissed. But political observers believe that Rajinikanth, with almost nil political work to his credit, cannot become an alternative for Jayalalithaa in the next assembly elections. If he bags a few seats, it will only add to the fragmentation of votes. This is where the need for an alliance comes into the picture.\nWhile announcing his political decision, Rajinikanth had announced that his party would be secular one, above religion and caste. If he has to consolidate his fan base, it is important to remain secular as his fan base cuts across all religions and castes. Any alliance with the BJP will be detrimental to the support he enjoys among his fans.\nAnother important plank of his party is \u2018anti-corruption\u2019. Both the Dravidian parties and the Congress have had to battle allegations of graft and an alliance with them will put his anti-corruption promises at stake.\nIn short, the superstar will have to build a party on his own steam. But the fan base alone is unlikely to be strong enough to guarantee him the numbers in the next assembly election. According to Manivannan, the registered fan club won\u2019t be more than 50,000. The new website launched by him has lakhs of members. However, many of these curious internet users need not necessarily vote for him. Garnering votes is not like getting fans to promote the films.\nM G Ramachandran, Jayalalithaa and Vijaykanth came from the film world.

But such associations between a neighborhood\u2019s \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d and the general well-being of its population are the subject of increasing interest to those who study and promote public health.\nA new project by an associate professor at Washington State University\u2019s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine is beginning to map some of those factors for Spokane at a very granular level, with a new online tool that makes it possible to examine differences between neighborhoods on a variety of measures.\nThe Spokane Healthy Living Indicators Project is a continuation of the work that associate professor Pablo Monsivais began during his six years on the faculty at the University of Cambridge, mapping food access across Great Britain.\nThe SHELI project went online last week. It provides data on seven categories, including the density of fast-food restaurants within a mile, the availability of doctors and dentists, access to supermarkets and walkability. You can look at the information by neighborhood \u2013 or drill down all the way to your own address.\nFor example, I live in the Cliff-Cannon Neighborhood. When I look at the neighborhood characteristics, they show a relatively high density of fast-food offerings within a 1-mile radius, at 7.8 for the neighborhood on average. That\u2019s primarily because it\u2019s close to downtown \u2013 the Riverside Neighborhood \u2013 which has by far the highest concentration of such restaurants, at almost 22 within a 1-mile radius.\nBut the tool also can bore in much more closely, to the street or address level. Taking Cliff-Cannon as an example, when you drill into the street level, you see that density of fast-food joints varies depending on how close to downtown you are, as you would expect. And when I put in my own house, which is roughly in the center of the neighborhood, I get my personal fast-food density: 17 within a 1-mile radius.\nThere are also two grocery stores within walking distance, plenty of doctors nearby and a decent walkability score, at least compared with other parts of town.\nSHELI doesn\u2019t link these figures to health outcomes. But earlier research conducted by the Spokane Regional Health District examined the differences in health among Spokane\u2019s neighborhoods, and found stark differences. That research, a 2012 report called Odds Against Tomorrow, found that life expectancies varied dramatically among neighborhoods \u2013 the average life span varied by more than 18 years between the city\u2019s shortest life expectancy (66.17 years in the downtown Riverside district) and longest (84.03 in Southgate on Moran Prairie).\nIt found, on measure after measure, from unemployment to obesity to maternal"}

When the grout has deteriorated to a point that it can\u2019t be restored by cleaning, recoloring or resealing, you can revitalize your tiled floor by removing the old grout and replacing it with fresh grout.\nRemove old grout with a diamond-coated blade on the oscillating multitool. An oscillating multitool can be purchased or rented from hardware and home centers. These tools vibrate the blade at extremely high speed to grind away the old grout. Follow the grout lines in the tile, working first in the long direction and then in the wide direction. Grind down the old grout to a depth equal to at least half the thickness of the tile.\nChip away any grout remaining along the edges and corners of the tiles with a hammer and small chisel. Tap the chisel gently with the hammer to knock off the bits of grout. Take care to not chip the tile itself. Brush away the bits of old grout into a dustpan. Clean the tiled surface with isopropyl alcohol. Replace any damaged tiles before regrouting.\nPour 1 cup of dry grouting compound into the small plastic tub. Add water and stir with the putty knife until the grout is a smooth consistency, neither too crumbly nor too soupy. Let the grout sit for 10 minutes and stir it again before using it on the tile. Stir every 10 minutes while grouting.\nForce the grout into the joints between the tiles with the rubber grout float. Stroke the float across the joint diagonally to keep from gouging the grout. Use the float to remove excess grout from the tile surface. Work a small section at a time, covering an area you can reach without walking over fresh grout. If the grout gets too dry, discard it and mix another batch.\nAllow the grout in the newly grouted section to set for 15 minutes. Dampen a sponge in a bucket of water and wipe excess grout off the tile. Wipe diagonally across each joint. Rinse the sponge often. Grout additional sections until the floor is done. Wait at least 60 minutes after completing the last section. Buff off any remaining grout haze from the tiled floor with a clean soft cloth.

Fortune's Geoff Colvin asks CTO Sophie Vandebroek: Can the company keep it up?\n(Fortune Magazine) -- If all goes as scheduled, President Bush will hand Xerox's Sophie Vandebroek the National Medal of Technology at the White House in late July. It will be a sweet moment for her and for a company that was built on a world-changing innovation - xerography - but that lost its way for a while in the Digital Revolution.\nThe story of how Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s failed to capitalize fully on two of the most critical elements of the personal computer - the graphical user interface and the mouse - has become legend. In 2000, then-CEO Paul Allaire admitted that the company's business model didn't work anymore - a conclusion Wall Street had already reached. A year later Xerox's innovation ranking among its peers plunged to tenth (i.e., last) on Fortune's annual list of America's Most Admired Companies.\nFortune's Geoffrey Colvin talks with Xerox's Chief Technology Officer, Sophie Vandebroek about the struggle to come up with new products and services.\nVandebroek talks about the lack of female engineers in the workplace.\nColvin and Vandebroek discuss how she uses Second Life as a testing ground for future ideas.\nRecent years have been better. At a shade less than $16 billion, revenues have not changed much since 2003, but Xerox (Charts, Fortune 500) has increased profits every year, added $7 billion in market cap, and more than tripled its profit margins.\nOne key to the turnaround: Xerox has become an innovation power again, producing new technologies that can read, understand, route, and protect documents, among other things. Leading that effort is Vandebroek, 45, the company's chief technology officer since late 2005. Her task is to keep Xerox at the leading edge of infotech progress in ways that make shareholders richer.\nCOLVIN: Innovation may be the hottest topic in business. How can it be a competitive advantage for Xerox?\nVANDEBROEK: It's a matter of making sure that our customers constantly want to buy our products and services. Ultimately innovation is about delighting the customer, and that results in great economic returns for Xerox. If you innovate and it doesn't end up as something that the customer benefits from, then it's not innovation.\nHow does Xerox make sure that what it comes up with is not just what the engineers think is cool but what customers actually want?\nIt's tough. Innovation has two elements. No. 1, there is the creative piece, the \"Aha!\" moment. These are our own scientists and researchers and engineers, and our partners. A lot of what we do early on is dreaming and innovating with the customers. These are the early moments of understanding and seeing what nobody else has seen before that could result in a great product or service. The second piece is the \"intrapreneurial\" role within Xerox, making sure that this creative idea goes through the whole value chain and becomes the right product for the customer.\nIs there a risk of taking the passion out of something that ought to be full of passion?\nNo. If you can articulate a vision that makes people passionate, there are so many amazing things you"}

But until 2015, the FCC didn\u2019t have an efficient way to alert telecommunications providers of complaints and respond to consumers.\nThe agency purchased Zendesk\u2019s Support product to analyze, track, prioritize and solve customer complaints for the Consumer Help Center as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to move all of its legacy IT operations onto the cloud.\nThe software-as-a-service customer-complaint solution replaced 18 forms with a single ticketing system that provides support via email and a web form that handles up to 2,000 submissions a day. Approximately 98 percent of complaints are now filed online with the remaining 2 percent submitted on paper.\nWith the Zendesk platform, users can get immediate replies to their complaint filings and track them in real time. The process also reduced the FCC\u2019s overall response time by 10 days on average.\nWhile the FCC used to produce quarterly reports on the complaints data, the Zendesk system gives the agency a nuanced way to analyze it and find solutions to specific problems through a Socrata-powered open data application programming interface.\n\u201cThe FCC\u2019s Consumer Help Center leveraging Zendesk to replace our on-premise legacy systems represented the first external-facing SaaS product to go live at the FCC, but is one of many examples of how we\u2019re using cloud-based technology to radically modernize the FCC IT enterprise,\u201d Sarah Millican, FCC digital strategy advisor, told GCN.\nBuilding an on-premise system would have cost the $3.2 million, while Zendesk\u2019s platform -- running on Amazon Web Services infrastructure -- was deployed for $450,000. The service also reduces maintenance costs by $540,000 per year.\nDustin Laun, technology and innovation advisor at the FCC, originally suggested using a cloud-based system to cut down on costs and speed up the agency\u2019s process for communicating complaints information.\nZendesk offered the FCC an alternative that allowed it to get the Consumer Help Center \u201cup and running quickly, while also significantly reducing implementation costs and the time-to-launch timeline,\u201d Laun said. The streamlined filing process took less than six months to deploy rather than the one-year timeline provided to the FCC.\nThe SaaS model also eliminates operations and maintenance costs -- requiring the FCC to only pay renewal fees rather than for each change, as the previous system required. \u201cCloud computing systems are generally less expensive to operate, more secure and more agile than much of the IT systems you see in today\u2019s federal government IT landscape,\u201d Laun said.\nAdditionally, as the FCC makes improvements on the Consumer Help Center, the number of licenses needed to support the enterprise system decreases and the renewal cost goes down as a result.\nIn 2016, the agency decided to open up some of the complaint data to the public using a Socrata-powered open data site and API.

{"idx": "10459", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Oikonomou (Greek) \"Oi\" in Greek is pronounced as a long E.\nOikon (English = \u0113con) means house in classical Greek. The original meaning of Oikonomou was a home owner.\nOikonomou evolved from home owner to estate manager. Somebody who was responsible for all resources on the estate, a steward. Oikonomou was a medieval Eastern Roman title for somebody who was in charge of a project or institution. It is still used by the Greek Orthodox church. Hence the word economy means the management of resources. Since the proper management of resources would use the least amount, economy has also taken on the meaning of frugality.\nEver since the creation of currency, economic resources have been translated into and confused with money. Wealth is usually measured more in terms of money rather than what the money will buy or how much tangible assets we have accumulated.. We often talk about how much money we have in the bank, not what it will buy or what we own. We often forget that money and tangible assets are not the same thing. As a result, Oikonomou has evolved from a manager of resources, to a manager of money, a treasurer.\nMy great-grandfather Constantine lived in northeastern Greek province of Epirus near the city of Ioannina. Constantine was fighting the Turks with his village in the early 1800s. In order to avoid capture by the Turks he came up with the bright idea of putting the horseshoes on their horses backwards. The Turks always thought they were coming when they were going. The trick worked and his village rewarded him by making him the town Oikonomou, treasurer/steward. Over time, this title became the family name. I do not know what it was prior to this.\nThe \"mou\" ending connotes a sense of belonging. Greek names ending in \"ou\" are generally reserved for female members of a family. For example, the female members of a family named Mazarakos would have the last name Mazarakou. However, Oikonomou is an exception to this rule because the Oikonomou contains the sense of belonging/cartaker. Unfortunately, the officials at Ellis Island didn\u0092t always appreciate the fine points of Greek grammar and sometimes changed the ending to \"os\" upon arrival in America. In the United States there are about an equal number of Economos and Economou, but in Greek they are the same name.\nEvan is a Welsh name meaning youth, however, this is only the anglized version of my baptismal Greek name, Evangelos. My parents did not want to burden me with this, so they shortened it to Evan on the birth certificate. Evangelos mean good news(evangelical, evangelism). It is the name given to the holiday celebrating the Annunciation, when Mary was told by the angel Gabriel that she would bear God's son. It is celebrated on March 25, nine months before the celebration of Christ's birth. In 1821, it was also chosen by the Bishop of Patras as the day to proclaim Greece's independence (good news) from the Ottoman Turkish empire. Greeks celebrate name days rather than birthdays. As prescribed by Greek custom, the first son is named after the father's father, so Evangelos was also my grandfather's name. He ran away from his home in Epirus near Ioannia, at the age of 10 in 1870 and eventually owned a chain of bakeries in Athens and made lots of money (I never saw a penny).

Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, that would fund the subsidies \u2014 as almost every expert suggested back then. But now, passing the same bill would make coverage less affordable for more people than it would help.\nLikely losers: 1,706,780 enrollees with silver plans and incomes between 200%-400% of the federal poverty level.\nHow it works: After Trump cut off federal funding for the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies, insurers raised their premiums to make up the difference. Most of them loaded the whole increase onto the premium for \"silver\" plans. Those are the only plans that offer the cost-sharing reductions in question, and they're also used to calculate the separate subsidy each person can use toward their premiums.\nAs premiums rose for \"silver\" plans, everyone got a bigger premium subsidy.\nLosers: People in gold and bronze plans, whose subsidies are now covering more of their monthly premiums. This would reverse if cost-sharing payments resumed and the size of the premium subsidy dropped.\nWinners: People enrolled in silver plans, who make too much to qualify for a premium subsidy.\nThese people felt the brunt of the premium hikes because they weren't getting any federal assistance. If the premiums go down because CSR payments are made, they pay less.\nWe used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data on 2017 plan selections in states using healthcare.gov.

Costello's finishing was crisp, too, and a haul of 0-6, five from play, reflective of a productive evening's work.\nIn each of the last three summers, Gavin has unearthed a new forward to freshen up his starting championship attack.\nIt could be that he doesn't have to dig too deeply for this year's 'find'.\n\"Certainly it benefits a player if he's getting a good run of games in the league to stake a claim for a championship spot,\" the Dublin manager acknowledged.\n\"That's the form that we'd know from Cormac.

Here the helmer-scripter is inspired by her backstory, with mixed Italian-German parentage, strong sister personalities and a farm in central Italy figuring into the story. Aiming to capture a young teen\u2019s sense of belonging in a family determined to steer its own course, the pic has intermittent rewards yet isn\u2019t weighty enough to justify a Cannes competish slot. Smaller fests and a modest Euro release make more likely venues.\nLike \u201cCorpo celeste,\u201d the film opens with an indistinct nighttime scene that appears unmoored from what\u2019s to come. Hunters imprecisely glimpsed in roaming flashlights are never seen again, and later only the occasional sound of rifle discharges, railed against by pater familias Wolfgang (Belgium\u2019s Sam Louwyck), reminds viewers of this prologue. The idea (presumably) is to confirm the protags as an independent unit not born to the traditions of the land \u2014 they farm, but they don\u2019t hunt. German transplant Wolfgang; his wife, Angelica (the helmer\u2019 sis Alba); their four daughters; and an unexplained member of the entourage, Coco (Swiss thesp Sabine Timoteo), are refugees from contempo urban life who have turned their backs on the system, to farm and keep bees in as pure a way as possible.\nGelsomina (Maria Alexandra Lungu), on the brink of her teens, is the eldest child and a key participant in the family\u2019s beekeeping venture. Since this is summer, helmer Rohrwacher doesn\u2019t need to bother with the interruptions of school, focusing on Gelsomina\u2019s position in the family and on the farm. Marinella (Agnese Graziani), four years younger, is independent-spirited and often in conflict with her sister (\u201cCorpo celeste\u201d also featured a pair of argumentative sisters; could there be some root in the Rohrwachers\u2019 past?). Angelica looks after their few animals and the two youngest kids, but otherwise her presence is less felt than those of Wolfgang and the two older daughters.\nAudiences will need to glean the family\u2019s history from behavior more than from dialogue or action: They\u2019re newcomers to this part of the country (much of the shooting took place in the region where Lazio, Umbria and Tuscany meet), the kind of rural transplants who like to sleep outdoors and who denounce the industrialization of agriculture. So when Wolfgang and the kids stumble upon the filming of a cheap promo for a \u201cMost Traditional Family\u201d contest, he\u2019s dismissive of this crass objectification, while Gelsomina and Marinella, typical children, are seduced by the idea of appearing alongside wondrous glamour queen Milly Catena (Monica Bellucci).\nOf course, Wolfgang won\u2019t agree to selling out like that, but he\u2019s in need of money quickly: European law requires he standardize the area where the honey is processed, and the family can\u2019"}

Hold a bunch of bake sales !!!! It is just never going to stop.\nHow is it that the Johnston School District approves a bond to build a new school, and THEN we hear about a budget short fall.

Be it a replica of Han Solo\u2019s Millennium Falcon or a bustling colorful brick city, there are few limits on what can be created with a set of Legos.\nUnderstanding the inspirational power native to these bricks, an Italian entrepreneur decided to dramatically up the building-block ante with a project called Edo. Essentially Legos on steroids \u2014 and made of cardboard \u2014 Edo blocks expand on the DIY spirit in a manner similar to their smaller plastic cousins while adding their own unique flair.\nThey\u2019re basically Legos big enough to use to build a small house.\nKnowing that something described as \u201cgiant Legos\u201d is bound to be a massive hit, Simon Marussi (the entrepreneur behind this innovative idea) decided to launch Edo on the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The campaign offers adopters the opportunity to choose between blank sets of Edo or specific packs capable of building crocodiles, giraffes, and Edolinis (essentially an Edo-built person), with the largest set containing a whopping 500 pieces.\nMade of nothing more than cardboard, Edo bricks are fully customizable by the user. Be it covering them in spray paint, adding googly eyes, or using glue and construction paper, the final product is completely up to the builder. To show this off, the launch video displays constructed castles, dog houses, trees, and even cabinets using nothing but combinations of Edo blocks. Obviously, Marussi developed these blocks with children in mind but it\u2019s hard not to imagine the kind of adults who still have tubs of Legos in their house salivating at the opportunity to play with this innovative set.\nEdo blocks ship to backers as a group of flat, high quality corrugated cardboard pieces that (according to the Edo team) are \u201cvery easy\u201d to assemble. Though we\u2019ve yet to put this to the test ourselves \u2014 be on the lookout for a hands-on video soon \u2014 the campaign says kids as young as 10 should have no issue piecing them together. Available shapes include one, two, and four brick pieces as well as single and double flat sections, and are made of 100-percent recycled and recyclable cardboard.\nAt the time of this writing, the Edo Kickstarter campaign already boasted 14 backers for a total of roughly $1,300.

Kaluza, 65, and Vidrine, 68, were among four BP workers to face charges in the aftermath of the spill.\nThe U.S. accused the pair of ignoring multiple signals that the well was dangerously unstable before the explosion. Kaluza and Vidrine were each charged with 11 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of violating the U.S. Clean Water Act.\nVidrine pleaded guilty Wednesday to the pollution count. Kaluza will continue to fight the remaining charge, said his lawyer Shaun Clarke. A trial is set to begin Feb. 16 in New Orleans.\nThe two BP well-site managers had earlier won dismissal of 11 counts of seaman\u2019s manslaughter, a separate crime, after a court ruled that the victims weren\u2019t seamen.\nDavid Rainey, BP\u2019s former vice president of exploration, won acquittal in June of a federal charge that he lied to prosecutors in connection with company estimates of the size of spill. Kurt Mix, a former BP engineer, pleaded guilty in November to a misdemeanor of deleting text messages related to spill estimates, following reversal of an earlier conviction.\nThe Justice Department dropped the involuntary manslaughter charges against Kaluza and Vidrine after deciding it couldn\u2019t prove its case, agency spokesman Peter Carr said Wednesday.\nFederal prosecutors re-evaluated charges against Kaluza and Vidrine after hearing testimony in the civil trials over the causes of the spill. \u201cA number of witnesses have testified multiple times since the indictment was brought, and the factual landscape has changed,\u201d Carr said in an e-mail.\nThe department couldn\u2019t meet the legal standard for involuntary manslaughter, defined as \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life,\u201d he said. The U.S. believed it could justify seaman\u2019s manslaughter charges, but an appeals court refused to reinstate those counts.\nVidrine agreed to perform 100 hours of community service, complete 10 months of probation, and pay $50,000 in restitution, Carr said. The judge must still approve the deal, whose terms can\u2019t be altered, Carr said.

Tea is the only plantation crop whose exports are calculated according to the calendar year.\nSpice exports started picking up from September and the deficit for the April-October period is just 2% by volume and 4.6% by value.\nRoshni Sen, deputy chairperson of the Tea Board of India, the government trade promotion body, said the non-availability of sufficient crops has prevented India from boosting exports.\nStill, Indian exporters have benefited as weather and production patterns have been similar across the world, with major tea-producing nations such as Kenya and Sri Lanka reporting lower crop output on account of drought conditions.\nBetween January and September, the period for which figures are available, tea production fell to 696.72 million kg from 706.74 million kg in the year earlier. India exported 131.23 million kg, against 150.25 million kg last year.\nHowever, a hike in unit prices due to a supply crunch pushed up the cost of tea to Rs135.42 a kg from Rs111.93 a kg last year, with export earnings rising to Rs1,777.05 crore from Rs1,581.07 crore.\nMeanwhile, an import order from Iraq for 15 million kg of Indian and Sri Lankan teas last week met with a lukewarm response from Indian exporters due to concerns over payments.\nDeepak Shah, chairman of the South Indian Tea Exporters Association, said that though India had an advantage over Sri Lanka, where output has dropped and prices are higher, exporters were unwilling to take any risks.\n\u201cThere have been issues of delayed payments.

But every time I try and ask my husband to include me, he basically brushes me off. How can I get him to take me seriously?\nAnswer: First off, good for you. We adamantly believe that, within a couple, both people need to be on the same page about the household finances. Yet, according to a recent study by UBS, 56 percent of married women currently leave key financial decisions to their husband. Perhaps surprisingly, the numbers are actually worse for younger wives: 61 percent of Millennial women let their husbands make financial decisions, while it\u2019s 54 percent for older women.\nWe obviously don\u2019t know your husband or the best strategy for changing his mind. But one way to perhaps gain some traction with him could be to share concrete reasons as to why you want to be involved. For instance, you mention that getting older has helped you understand the importance of making decisions together. Take this idea a step further. Tell him you have a really good chance of outliving him \u2013 in fact, according to MarketWatch, once you both reach 65, you\u2019re likely to live 11 \u00bd years longer than him on average. Since these financial decisions will most likely be on your shoulders someday anyway, it\u2019s better to be involved sooner rather than later. It\u2019s not fair to be left in the lurch.\nIt also sounds like your husband might like handling the finances, so he\u2019s afraid that if you get too involved this responsibility won\u2019t be \u2018his\u2019 anymore. But stand your ground. Explain that you\u2019re simply looking to be more aware of what\u2019s going, that you deserve to be a part of the conversation. After all, it\u2019s your money (and future), too.\nThe Simply Money Point is that we recommend you and your husband sit down and have a serious conversation about your desire to get more involved and why he\u2019s resisting. You need to get to the root of this friction. We wish you luck.\nJulie in Colerain Township: Just got my tax refund! What\u2019s the best way to use it: paying off credit card debt or starting an emergency fund?\nAnswer: As of March 29th, the average refund was $2,873. But, no matter how much your refund is, our answer is pretty cut and dry: start your emergency fund.\nAt first glance, using this money for an emergency fund probably sounds pretty boring. And you\u2019re right. An emergency fund is just some cash sitting in an account that probably isn\u2019t earning a whole lot of interest. But that\u2019s ok. An emergency fund is supposed to be boring. It\u2019s supposed to be there, whenever you need it, to get you out of a jam. Because let\u2019s face it, life happens. The furnace goes out. Your car needs brakes. You make a surprise trip to the emergency room.\nYet, a recent study from the Federal Reserve Board shows that 40 percent of Americans can\u2019t cover a $400 emergency expense. And you know what usually happens when someone doesn\u2019t have cash to pay for an unexpected expense? It goes on the credit card.\nStop the cycle. Build up your emergency fund. We recommend having enough money in the account to cover at least three months\u2019 worth of your most vital living expenses (six months\u2019 worth of expenses is even better).\nHere\u2019s The Simply Money Point: Don\u2019t get us wrong.

Google\u2019s social tumble, remains to be Schmidt\u2019s biggest regrets.\nIt was during the same time, that Google co-founder Larry Page became the CEO of the company, and started streamlining the company\u2019s chain of command along with co-founder Sergey Brin. Of course, Page and Brin would have been frustrated on behalf of Schmidt\u2019s failure to do something about the threat. But he owned it. He put himself out in the public, admitting that he was wrong and that he was going to do his best to address it.\nWhen a leader sticks to a particular decision, his associates deserve to know what made him take the decision as much as the board does. When a leader doesn\u2019t take time out to explain a certain decision, people immediately jump to the conclusion that he\u2019s either detached, too dumb, or simply doesn\u2019t care enough.\nEmployees appreciate a leader who admits to his mistake. This helps not just to earn their trust, but also have an engaged workforce led by a strong leader.\nTo summarize, accountability, accessibility, admitting to one\u2019s mistakes, is the exact tools one needs to build trust, engagement, and credibility to lead."}

Solo travel is an extraordinary, accessible opportunity that can involve big or small adventures, easy or difficult as you choose.\nYou can do what you want, when you want, how you want, where you want. You pick your own pace, budget, itinerary and can always change your mind on a whim, never having to negotiate. The experience can be liberating and thrilling, igniting a rewarding sense of accomplishment, and the detachment from your \ufffdreal\ufffd life is often therapeutic.\nWhen entering a new place on your own, you may notice more than you do when you travel with others. I strike up conversations more easily when I\ufffdm solo, something I\ufffdve done in dozens of countries across six continents. But not all destinations are right for solo travelers. Here are some tips.\n\ufffd Visit walkable destinations connected by trains, buses, ferries and flights. Getting around this way will be straightforward, prices will be per person, and you increase your odds of meeting others, unlike destinations best seen or reached by car, where there may be fewer interactions. I\ufffdve found places outside the U.S. and Caribbean are sometimes more friendly to individuals, with reduced-fare single-person rooms. Youth hostels are great for 20-somethings and travelers of any age on tight budgets who crave conversation and don\ufffdt need upscale accommodations.\n\ufffd Traveling offseason can save a lot of money. One year in October, it was cheaper for me to spend a week in Costa Rica than to visit the Adirondacks in upstate New York. The off-peak flight, local transport and single accommodation in Costa Rica was less than the car rental and pricier double rooms during fall foliage season in New York.\n\ufffd If you can\ufffdt fly nonstop, turn your stopovers into perks. I\ufffdve visited Fiji, Iceland, London, Paris and Rome, at no extra cost, all on extended layovers.\n\ufffd Ask others about their vacations to get ideas for your own trips, and read up online and in guidebooks. Publishers can vary tremendously so look at a variety of brands in a bookstore or library, then travel with a guidebook that best suits your priorities.\n\ufffd Be prepared for the occasional bad day. I\ufffdve been tired, cranky, lonely and frustrated, suffering from food poisoning and stressed out by emergency landings, 14-hour flight delays, altercations with customs officials, bad weather and other complications. But temporary misery is part of travel, and can help you enjoy the magnificent moments that much more. And sometimes the worst experiences generate great stories later on.\n\ufffd Write in a journal every night. It records your adventures while also giving you the conversational outlet to express and process the details of your action-packed day.\n\ufffd When dining alone, bring a book or journal. Eating at the bar may feel more comfortable than a table for one.\n\ufffd Be respectful, inconspicuous and dress to blend in. Local fashion norms vary, but I typically wear jeans with subdued colors, dark shoes and subtle accessories so as not to attract undue attention.\n\ufffd English has become the world\ufffds second language, but learning to say hello and thank you in the local tongue goes a long way.\n\ufffd Be cautious but not paranoid.

In particular, said Weibo, it could have a hard time attracting and engaging users if people are afraid to post content to the service.\nWeibo's raising of red flags is the latest example of how online civil liberties issues are inflicting very real costs on internet companies and, by extension, the countries that host them. And China is hardly the only culprit. The censorship-sullied IPO comes on the heels of revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. government, and evidence that such surveillance slowed and complicated business for companies trying to sell cloud-based solutions to large corporations. In Russia, meanwhile, the CEO of the country's largest social network, VK, resigned under a cloud, implying Kremlin interference. In each case, freedom isn't the only thing that's lost. Oppression also costs money.\nAt Weibo, government crackdowns seem to have already hobbled the social network. After authorities passed a law threatening to jail anyone who posted an \"inaccurate\" message that was reposted more than 500 times, monthly users declined by 28 million. Today, the company has just 129 million monthly users, barely half that of Twitter.\nTo be sure, some of Weibo's has been due to competition from mobile-native competitor WeChat. Weibo also suffers because its users aren't valued as highly as those on U.S. based networks, in part because the company hasn't developed mature ad offerings; Weibo will be worth less than a sixth as much as Twitter if it sells 20 million shares today at $17 to $19 a piece, as planned.\nWeibo isn't alone in saying that government interference can hurt the bottom line. The New York Times last month reported that U.S. tech companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build overseas data centers to reassure clients nervous about surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency.\nSilicon Valley startups say it's gotten harder to convince large customers their data will be safe since revelations of mass surveillance were leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden last year.\n\"Our conversations with customers and prospective customers around cloud deployment has only gotten tougher since Snowden,\" says Matt Tucker, co-founder of Jive Software, which makes collaboration software and social networks for corporations.\nIn Russia, government intervention can be more direct. Pavel Durov, the CEO and co-founder of social network VK, briefly stepped down earlier this month, saying he couldn't defend that company's \"founding principles\" after a fund run by a reported ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin acquired 48 percent of his company. VK has said previously that it fielded censorship requests from the government. Durov later wrote that he would stay on board to guide the company \"at this difficult time.\"\nThere's nothing new, of course, about government monitoring and intervention in online activity."}

Many people will qualify for the first time this year because their incomes declined, their marital status changed or they added children to their families. Bigger families with three or more children get an extra boost with a larger credit this year. Workers without children also may qualify.\nFour of five eligible workers claim and get their EITC. IRS wants to raise that number to five out of five. However, workers can get their EITC only if they file federal income tax returns -- even if they are not otherwise required to file -- and specifically claim the credit.\nEITC can put up to $5,666 into the pockets of families and individuals. The average credit last year was $2,200. Anyone with earnings under $48,362 from wages, self-employment or farming in 2010, should see if they qualify. They earned it. Now they just need to file and claim it.\nTaxpayers wanting to know whether they qualify for the EITC can visit an IRS office. IRS personnel are available to answer taxpayers' questions, offer additional information about the EITC, provide publications about this valuable credit and help prepare returns claiming the credit.\nIRS offices will be open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Portsmouth office is at 80 Daniel St. Taxpayers can locate the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center nearest them by visiting IRS.gov.\nAside from IRS offices, taxpayers may also receive assistance at more than 12,000 free tax assistance sites nationwide.

{"idx": "10515", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: WHILE e-commerce is remaking how business gets done, it is also remaking traditional alliances on tax policy, creating a deep rift within the Republican Party and building common ground between some antitax Republicans and some Democrats who have opposed the antitax agenda.\nThe unpredictability of the matter extends much further. Efforts to make the Internet a permanent tax-free zone obviously pose problems for off-line businesses. But the most direct impact might be felt by state and local governments, which now receive almost half their revenue from sales taxes. As more transactions move online, falling revenue would have to be made up either through higher taxes on property, income and off-line sales or through cuts in services.\nIn 1998, at the behest of e-commerce companies seeking a tax break, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibited multiple and discriminatory taxes on the Internet and effectively prohibited sales taxes on e-commerce that crosses state lines until 2001.\nLast month, the antitax Republicans in the House leadership pushed for a vote to extend the moratorium for five years, to 2006, even though the current moratorium had 18 months left and even though hearings on the extension were not scheduled until a week after the vote.\nThe House Republican leadership pushed through the vote in the face of solid opposition by a traditional Republican constituency, the nation's retailers, from mighty Wal-Mart to local federations of mom-and-pop stores. They all want a level playing field in which there would be no distinctions for sales tax purposes among bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar and pure cyberspace businesses.\nThe moratorium extension is very likely to face a much tougher time in the Senate as retailers step up their lobbying. President Clinton has not said whether he will sign the bill, but the administration's representatives on the Internet tax commission have opposed extending the moratorium.\nBoth Mr. Istook and Mr. Conyers expressed concern that the moratorium would take power from state and local governments, which provide the bulk of government services, like police protection and education.\nMr. Istook wrote to his colleagues that his fellow antitax Republicans have lost sight of the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states and the people those powers not expressly authorized or denied to the federal government.\nTHE argument that opposing an extension of the moratorium means favoring higher taxes, which was promoted by the House leadership, was called bunk by Mr. Istook.\nHe urged his colleagues to fight high levels of taxes, rather than give a break to one industry. ''Tax justice is not achieved by promoting injustice; tax justice must be based on fairness,'' Mr. Istook wrote.\nMr. Conyers, while not agreeing that taxes are too high, said the state and local tax system was a mess and that by extending the moratorium to 2006, Congress would remove an incentive for the states to streamline sales taxes.\nAs much as Americans complain about the complexity of the income tax, the sales tax regimes of 45 states, plus the District of Columbia, are vastly more complex. A can of soda is untaxed as a grocery item in Ohio, for example, but is taxed as a convenience in New York.\nThe two congressmen, and many retailers, want to use the rise of e-commerce as a cudgel to force the states to simplify the sales tax, creating standard definitions of items and eliminating picayune rules.\nGov.

{"idx": "10516", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Gospel presentations have a disproportionate influence on the way people afterwards read the Bible. Therefore, it substantially shapes their biblical & theological framework.\n(That last sentence summarizes one of my basic convictions). It\u2019s worth reading again.\nThis single idea is the seed for both The Promises of God as well as The Creator King.\nWhy do it this way?\nTypical gospel tracts and presentations are extremely cursory and confusing for many people, especially those who have not heard the gospel before. In a sense, the presentations are so simplified that they are difficult to understand.\nOther tools have made serious efforts to share more of the Story (e.g. \u201cC2C\u201d & \u201cThe Story\u201d). The problem however is that they tend drastically to truncate the biblical narrative, largely cutting out most of God\u2019s revelation but omitting Israel.\nI think people don\u2019t give enough of the grand Story of the Bible. Doctrinal statements are simply signposts to the Story. They should not be confused with the Story itself. I\u2019m not talking about mere storytelling. I refer to the one overarching narrative about which all of Scripture testifies.\nThe Promises of God helps people put the gospel back into its biblical context. How so?\nI present the gospel in a way that is framed by the three major Old Testament covenants\u2013\u2013the Abrahamic, the Mosaic, and the Davidic Covenant. Without these covenants, the New Testament simply does not make sense. (I was first inspired to this through this questions when I say how Paul equated the Abrahamic covenant and the gospel in Gal 3:8).\nWhy The Promises of God?\nThe Promises of God has a shorter version and a full version. I have a few goals for both versions of the presentations.\n1. The Promises of God narrates the grand story both in a balanced way and in proportion to the Bible\u2019s own emphases.\n2. The presentation defines key terms and themes while also showing their interconnections. This is critical for giving people the sort of comprehension that reshapes worldview.\n3. It can be further utilized during the process of discipleship. If the truth be known, solid evangelism is the beginning of good disciple-making. If our evangelism doesn\u2019t make disciples (but only converts), then we have a problem.\n4. It shows believers how to interconnect the New Testament and Old Testament. It especially shows how Jesus fulfills Israel\u2019s history.\nThe pictures are symbolic of the various stages in the Story. They serve two purposes.\nFirst, they help people remember how to share the gospel story. The simple shapes can be drawn in the sand or on a napkin, which enables people to reproduce it from memory. The written words then become a script in their heads during a conversation.\nSecond, the pictures reinforce the Story for listeners and so make it easier for them to recall the story as well.\nSome presentations depend on limiting the number of statements or verses to 4\u20135. Others use alliteration. The Promises of God tells an integrated, coherent story but allows for easy recall because the pictures are simple and build on each other.\nSomeone may object that The Promises of God and The Creator King are too long for the average person to recall.\nIn truth, people everyday hear stories or watch movies with a lot more information that you\u2019ll find in these booklets. A number of details are simply for context and to establish tone. Through strategic repetition, one\u2019s attention is constantly brought back to"}

That's true for many California and West Coast hotels, thanks in large part to the number of actors who called the hotels home during on-location shoots.

It explicitly states that America can make due with a smaller nuclear force.\nIt is somewhat jaw-dropping in its cavalier attitude toward national defense. Obama does not even keep up the pretense that the threats determine our defense budget. He\u2019s decided to budget only enough for some threats.\nThis is a lead from behind strategy for a left-behind America. The President has packaged our retreat from the world in the guise of a new strategy to mask his divestment of our military and national defense. This strategy ensures American decline in exchange for more failed domestic programs. In order to justify massive cuts to our military, he has revoked the guarantee that America will support our allies, defend our interests, and defy our opponents. The President must understand that the world has always had, and will always have a leader. As America steps back, someone else will step forward.\nAn honest and valid strategy for national defense can\u2019t be founded on the premise that we must do more with less, or even less with less.

Patients with underlying Alzheimer\u2019s dementia pathology have a 90% chance of developing dementia after a stroke. Findings of research suggest that enhancing vascular health can effectively prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. The findings have been published recently in an international leading scientific publication, journal of Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia.\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. There are over 35 million people worldwide, including 70,000 in Hong Kong suffering from this disease. The latter is expected to triple in the next 30 years due to aging problems.\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia is characterized by progressive loss of cognition, such as memory, executive function and language. Pathologically, it is characterized by deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. International researches show that one in every three senior citizens aged 65 or above has underlying amyloid plaques in the brain. According to the Census and Statistics Department of HKSAR, approximately 35,000 senior citizens in Hong Kong may have underlying amyloid plaques who may later develop Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nDr. Lisa Au, Clinical Tutor (Honorary), Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics at CUHK, stated, \u2018The present study provides strong evidence that cerebrovascular disease triggers Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Maintaining vascular health will not only lower the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, but also prevent dementia.\u2019 Dr. Au also pointed out that preventive measures of cerebrovascular disease include treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia, smoking cessation, increase of physical activity, weight reduction in obese individuals, adoption of a healthy diet and the use of anticoagulant drugs in subjects with atrial fibrillation.\nLooking forward, the research team will further investigate the pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia including estimating the prevalence of amyloid plaques among dementia-free elderly subjects and evaluating whether certain drugs are able to clear up amyloid plaques or to prevent dementia onset among those with amyloid plaques."}

And winning.\nThe Gunners played that free-flowing stuff in their last game and got battered 6-3 by Manchester City as they tried to chase the game.\nLast night the result was more important than turning on the style.\nArsenal were without Jack Wilshere, suspended for his middle-finger gesture to the City fans, and Laurent Koscielny, who had not recovered from a gashed knee.\nIn came Thomas Vermaelen, while Mathieu Flamini dropped to the bench, with Aaron Ramsey playing in a deeper role and Tomas Rosicky on the left.\nMourinho picked his team with containment on his mind \u2013 Mikel selected to try to tame Mesut Ozil while Juan Mata was left on the bench along with Oscar. Chelsea strung five across midfield, played deep and closed the space to prevent Arsenal playing between the lines.\nThis blue blanket ensured a tame start, but matters got spicy when Cesar Azpilicueta went through the back of Ramsey\u2019s legs and Frank Lampard followed moments later sliding in on Bacary Sagna right on the touchline in front of Mourinho.\nThe Chelsea manager tried to lift Sagna back to his feet, but the Arsenal man was having none of it.\nIt took Arsenal nearly 25 minutes to create their first opening, with Sagna breaking free on the right and delivering a skidding cross into the area. Fortunately for Chelsea, Gary Cahill was alert at the near post and slid in to clear.\nChelsea went up the other end and fashioned a chance of their own, Ramires heading Willian\u2019s cross over.\nIn their next attack Chelsea went agonisingly close.

He has been converting a variety of data sources about our environment from NASA into cool Google Earth visualizations. Today Valery will share with you this collection of overlays showing the progression of day time land temperatures for the Earth for entire years starting with year 2000 until 2005. The data comes from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite project. These are not satellite/aerial photos, but are images of temperature data overlayed on top of GE's satellite photos.\nOnce you download the Day Land Temperatures file, you will see some sub-folders for each year. You should open these sub-folders and turn on each month to look at the data. On my system, if I just turn on an entire year, it kind of animates the overlays while loading them the first time. But, a better way to see the progression of the data is to use the movies Valery has created: small movie (1.2 Mbytes) or larger movie (3.7 Mbytes).\nGreat work Valery!

You can go to each location, checkout the satellite or aerial photo, and try tilting your view so you can see the height and shape of the 3D landscape at an angle. Turn on Google Earth Community layers to see other interesting information about the area.\nThe post for H21's collection is here in case you want to tell H21 about the locations for other countries, or have a correction to send him.

Rays of sunlight broke through in places, brightening spots in the forest like searchlights.\nThere are few landscapes more dramatic than Yakushima, and few places with more weather; within seconds we were being pelted by our 12th rainstorm of the day. But none of this bothered Sachito Fujimoto, one of Honda's top engineers.\n\"It's the perfect climate for us,\" he said with a grin, and we climbed into the dumpy little blue car he was testing.\nThe Honda FCX isn't much to look at, but it's the closest thing to a genuine car of the future you can drive on public roads.\nUnderneath the bonnet - and under the passenger seats as well - is a revolutionary fuel-cell engine that produces no pollution and, in effect, runs on nothing more than the enormous amounts of rain that fall on Yakushima.\nWhich is why Honda has chosen to test it on this remote southern island - a Unesco World Heritage Site better known for its sheer mountains and ancient forests.\nFuel cells don't run literally on water, but on hydrogen, which is forced through membranes inside the fuel-cell stack, producing an electric current that powers the car. You can make hydrogen from water, but that also requires electricity - and it so happens Yakushima has abundant quantities of that, too.\nThe reason lies 170 metres (yards) down a steep tunnel, which takes you deep under the mountains, on a funicular railway.\nThat is where the local electricity company has built turbines to harness the enormous hydro-electric potential on Yakushima - and it has done that so successfully that it produces far more electricity than the island's 15,000 inhabitants can use.\nSurplus electricity cannot be stored, so the company has joined forces with Kagoshima University and Honda, to make hydrogen for the fuel-cell FCX.\nSo some of Honda's top engineers have to spend several weeks a year on the island, running the FCX along its twisty mountain roads, and putting up with the endless rain.\n\"Actually it's a very good testing ground,\" says Mr Fujimoto, \"we want to show that our car can perform well in all kinds of extreme weather conditions\".\nIt doesn't hurt the car-maker's image, either, that it is associated with one of the most pristine natural environments left in Japan.\nHiroshi Ishii, the president of the electricity company, has grander dreams, of an island entirely powered by renewable energy.\nHe pulls out a colourful leaflet showing how the hydrogen could fuel all the cars, buses and boats on the island. It could even, he thinks, be shipped to a neighbouring island where Japan's space programme is based, to power its rockets.\nFor the moment, though, this is just a dream; his main customer is still Honda.\nThe people of Yakushima have now got used to seeing the little blue car swishing silently around their island.\nIt is an impressive machine, with surprisingly good acceleration for a car that runs on water.\nThe technology is still too expensive for mass-production, but Honda has loaned other prototypes to city governments and individuals in the United States, in the hope that one day, they may be the first to produce a truly affordable fuel-cell car.\nAnd the islanders, who are very proud of their World Heritage status, say playing host to such a clean-living"}

This shows the party is still significant, at least for 1,150,000 citizens, as compared to the 770,000 votes cast for its presidential candidate, Marie-Georges Buffet, in 2007.\nContinuing his dramatic slide in the opinion polls, President Sarkozy, whose policies are now supported by only 37 percent of the French people, can no longer argue that he has the country\u2019s backing for his antisocial counter-reforms. The president\u2019s party, the Union pour un Mouvement populaire (Union for a Popular Movement, originally founded by Jacques Chirac in 1976) lost many big city mayors and even some departmental (county) councils.\nThe Socialist Party (PS), which elected the most candidates, benefited from the defeat of the right parties and from a very high level of abstention (35 percent on average and nearly 50 percent in most large cities). But in terms of votes, the PS remained at its 2004 level of around 26 percent. In fact, it changed nothing in its program from the last presidential elections \u2014 which it lost \u2014 and it recently helped the right to adopt the new European Constitutional Treaty.\nIn spite of the current \u201cunion of the left\u201d (Socialists, Communists and Greens), the PS strategy during the campaign was clearly that of openness towards the Modem, the new center-right party led by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who placed third in the 2007 presidential elections after Sarkozy (UMP) and S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal (PS). This is the party\u2019s basic political orientation as it looks ahead to the next presidential elections in 2012.\nThe PS leadership\u2019s alliance with the \u201ccenter\u201d (that is to say with the moderate right), was rejected by many Communists, who refused to accept this submission to the neoliberal order. As a consequence, in many places the PS did everything possible to oust the Communist candidates, as in the Seine-Saint-Denis department. The same phenomenon happened with the Greens (Verts), allied with the PS, who won cities against the PCF (like Montreuil, near Paris).\nAs during the 2005 campaign against institutionalizing neoliberalism in the European Union\u2019s constitution, the Communists\u2019 resurgence arose from specific local mobilizations. It gives new hope to many workers, retirees, unemployed, young people and migrants for their future struggles. The next battles will be hard, like those against the planned destruction of the labor contract, public health, national education, public housing and the retirement pensions system.\nThese electoral results also make clear that the Communist Party must continue to exist as the main party of the working people, in order to consolidate these new positive developments and to advance the social demands and anti-capitalist claims of the working classes in France. What they need is a strong and fighting PCF. And they also know that the Communists presented more candidates than the far left parties have rank-and-file members taken all together.\nThe future of the left struggle for real social progress and democratization in France will not be that of smooth reformism, as many social democrats believe, but that of radical change and a thorough rupture with the aggressive ne"}

If all goes well soon hundreds of Churches will have Solar and help reduce the Carbon footprint. Bishop Ernest Jackson and his congregation received a generous donation from a sponsor that approached LUMINALT. One good thing led to another and today California Interfaith Power and Light, LUMINALT - and many women and men of good faith - can praise God for trying to heal Mother Earth and pollute less.\nJuneteenth is a special day for African Americans and the congregation at Grace Tabernacle Community Church decided to praise God for all HIS benefits - and this year was especial - because, California Interfaith Power and Light teamed up with LUMINALT - a San Francisco Solar Company to give Grace Tabernacle Community Church - Solar Energy.\nWhen the knob was turned - Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E) became history - and what will happen from now on - is that the Grace Tabernacle Church will have surplus energy from the 58 Solar Panels placed to absorb maximum sunlight and generate clean energy.\nThis gift of God would not have been possible if it were not for Espanola Jackson who is a member of the Grace Tabernacle Church who pushed to make this project happen. She was aided by Rene Gonsalvez, Joshua Arce, and a host of sponsors Southeast Jobs Coalition, Commission for the Environment, Young Community Developers, Brightline Defense, Alpha and Omega Asthama Resource Center, and of course California Interfaith Power and Light.\nBishop Ernest Jackson gave a plaque to the many who helped including Espanola Jackson, Lynne Brown, and owners of LUMINALT, the key person from California Interfaith Power and Light and others that played a key role. Renee Gonsalvez was the Project Manager on this Solar Job at the Grace Tabernacle Community Church.\nThe Bayview Hunters Point was the first place in the City and County of San Francisco where Solar Panels were installed on 58 homes years ago. Today, many homes and Churches look forward to use the SUN as a means to provide electricity. Grace Tabernacle Community Church is now one more institution that will help reduce pollution and generated Clean Energy.\nSome of years ago some of us shut down the PG&E Electric Power Plant and soon we hope shut down the Mirant Plant - both used fossil fuel and pollute the environment.\nWith the brand new Pittsburg - Potrero TransBay line - that will help this City and County with an additional 400 MegaWatts of Electric - much of the extra energy needed during peak hours - will be met easily.\nRight now our total consumption is 960 MegaWatts.

{"idx": "10564", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This post originally appeared in the Winter 2013 issue of The Learning System.\nA truism in education is that professional learning is a process, not an event.\nNevertheless, many educators continue to experience learning as an isolated activity. The thinking, talking, and planning of school system and school leaders may focus primarily on professional learning as a workshop, skill development session, college course, or a conference. While leaders may hope that educators will use their new learning to improve their practice, often they don't ensure there is the time or support necessary to produce that result. This stunts professional learning and limits its impact and benefits.\nSchool system and school leaders should think of professional learning as having two dimensions. The first concerns conceiving, developing, organizing, managing, and producing, or contracting for, activities that engage educators in new learning. This has traditionally been the focus of professional development, and it continues to consume enormous resources and effort.\nThe second dimension of professional learning is what happens after learning experiences: in the context of their daily work, educators apply, practice, and refine their new learning, and document and assess the results. Most school system and school leaders have devoted much less attention and many fewer resources to this dimension of professional learning. The result is that in many communities, professional development has been, and continues to be, a half-a-loaf enterprise. It's better than nothing, but neither educators nor their students realize the full potential of effective professional learning.\nThis is why one of the seven professional learning standards addresses the importance of implementation. This standard recognizes that unless education leaders invest in implementation, professional learning will not increase educators' performance levels. Equally important, the standard implies that without serious attention to implementation, professional learning will risk a loss of support among both educators and the public.\nAs the standard makes clear, one aspect of implementation is helping educators understand that the purpose of professional learning is to change their practice. But educators are no different from other people. They may resist change, especially when their experience is that it means more work and apprehension, as well as the possibility of failure. Too often educators have been the subjects of high expectations, but only a smattering of professional development, followed by little or no workplace support.\nThis is why school system leaders and frontline educators must understand that the implementation of professional learning is a change process. It takes time. It requires clarity about purpose and intended outcomes, realigning the daily demands on educators, and practical, adaptive on-the-ground assistance. Understanding and applying the findings of change research to implementation will increase the chances that educators will be partners, not just participants, in effective professional learning.\nAs is true across all the standards, successful implementation depends on each of the other six standards. Thinking leaders are essential. Adequate resources, appropriately and equitably deployed, are necessary. Judicious use of data is foundational. Learning designs that positively impact educators' practice are indispensable. The standards only \"work\" if they work together.\nTo date, implementation has been the weak link in the chain of decisions and actions that constitute professional learning. It is so much more than developing and conducting a learning activity. Professional learning can only be effective if school system and school leaders understand it as a comprehensive, complex system and focus greater effort and resources on implementation that educators value."}

{"idx": "10566", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Teachers in the U.S. are slightly more likely to see student use of digital devices as having a positive rather than negative effect on the overall education of students. In contrast, they are far more negative about the effects of those devices on students' physical and mental health.\nPlease think about the effects of digital devices on students. Do you believe that students' use of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers has helpful or harmful effects in the following areas?\nThe nationally representative March 5-12 poll of U.S. teachers finds that more than four in ten K-12 teachers say students' use of digital devices has a \"mostly helpful\" effect on students' education, while 28% of teachers instead describe the effect of these devices as \"mostly harmful.\"\nMeanwhile, an overwhelming majority of teachers in the U.S. (69%) believe students' use of digital devices has mostly harmful effects on students' mental health; a slightly smaller share of teachers (55%) express this concern with respect to students' physical health.\nWhile estimates vary, there is little doubt that a substantial share of K-12 students own and regularly bring some type of digital device to school. According to 2015 research by the educational organization Pearson, majorities of students at all grade levels own a smartphone, including 53% of elementary school students, 65% of middle school students and 82% of high school students. Separately, Pew Research estimated in 2015 that more than two-thirds of teens (72%) own smartphones.\nDespite their potential use to students, researchers and education policymakers remain divided as to whether these devices can be effective learning tools for students. Most schools have banned the use of cellphones by students, though this number has declined in recent years. These results suggest that while the greater share of teachers see the educational potential of these types of technology, there is no broad consensus among teachers.\nBy a nearly 2-1 margin, elementary and middle school teachers are more likely to see students' use of digital devices as more helpful than harmful to their students' education, with 48% expressing the former sentiment and 23% the latter.\nTeachers of high school students, where ownership of certain digital devices is nearly universal, are less positive about the educational impact of these devices than their counterparts. Nearly as many high school teachers see the effect of these devices on students' education as mostly helpful as see it as mostly harmful, at 36% and 34%, respectively.\nYounger teachers (40 or younger) are more likely than their older counterparts to see the digital devices as helpful to students' overall education. Fifty-one percent of teachers under the age of 40 say digital devices will have \"mostly helpful\" effects on students' education, compared with the 36% of teachers aged 40 and older who agree with this sentiment. And while 22% of U.S. teachers under 40 see the use of digital devices in students' education as \"mostly harmful,\" 32% of teachers over 40 say the same.\nAmong all U.S. adults, younger individuals tend to rely on their digital devices more frequently than older adults; they also exhibit greater levels of attachment to these devices relative to older age groups. If these broad patterns apply to teachers, young teachers may have more favorable views of the educational value of digital devices due to their greater familiarity with and reliance on the technology.\nDespite major growth in the educational technology industry and widespread adoption of digital devices in schools across the U.S., only a slight plurality"}

Existing sales rose 4.0% in November.\nHousing has proved a sore data point in the recovery so far, however more and more investors are betting that the housing industry has already hit a bottom.\nPending home sales continued to gain in November and reached the highest level in 19 months, according to the National Association of Realtors\u00ae.\nThe Pending Home Sales Index,* a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, increased 7.3 percent to 100.1 in November from an upwardly revised 93.3 in October and is 5.9 percent above November 2010 when it stood at 94.5. The October upward revision resulted in a 10.4 percent monthly gain.\nThe last time the index was higher was in April 2010 when it reached 111.5 as buyers rushed to beat the deadline for the home buyer tax credit. The data reflects contracts but not closings.\nLawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said the gains may result partially from delayed transactions. \"Housing affordability conditions are at a record high and there is a pent-up demand from buyers who've been on the sidelines, but contract failures have been running unusually high. Some of the increase in pending home sales appears to be from buyers recommitting after an initial contract ran into problems, often with the mortgage,\" he said.\n\"November is doing reasonably well in comparison with the past year. The sustained rise in contract activity suggests that closed existing-home sales, which are the important final economic impact figures, should continue to improve in the months ahead,\" Yun added.\nPending home sales are not affected by the recently published rebenchmarking of existing-home sales because the index uses a different methodology based directly on contract signings, and is adjusted for seasonality.\nThe PHSI in the Northeast rose 8.1 percent to 77.1 in November but is 0.3 percent below November 2010. In the Midwest the index increased 3.3 percent to 91.6 in November and is 9.5 percent above a year ago. Pending home sales in the South rose 4.3 percent in November to an index of 103.8 and remain 8.7 percent above November 2010.

For in Mannheim, open standards \u2014 not cost \u2014 is the main driver of the software strategy.\nThis does not mean everything has to be open source \u2014 though much will be \u2014 but it does have to support open standards. \"We migrated from Microsoft Exchange Server 2005 to Oracle Collaboration Suite because it [OCS] supports open standards \u2014 it is proprietary software but it uses standard protocols,\" says Armbruster, talking to ZDNet UK about his plans.\nAlthough it has not mandated the use of open source, it has already migrated the majority of its 120 servers to Linux and plans to migrate its 3500 desktops to the open source productivity application OpenOffice.org running on Linux.\nThe migration to Linux on the server was predominantly driven by the IT department's decision to use open standards \u2014 it wanted to use OpenLDAP rather than Microsoft's proprietary Active Directory. Similarly, the migration to OpenOffice.org was driven by its desire to use OpenDocument \u2014 a standard file format that Microsoft has said it will not support in Microsoft Office.\nIn contrast to many large-scale moves to open source software, cost was largely irrelevant for Armbruster. Mannheim recently paid approximately \u20ac1m to Microsoft to migrate from Office 2000 to 2003 and yet, says Armbruster \"it was not important in our internal discussions \u2014 we never said to our mayor that if we switch to Linux we won't need to pay \u20ac1m to Microsoft.\"\nAlthough the city will save some money by switching to open source desktops, it is likely to spend a considerable sum migrating desktop applications from Windows to Linux. \"We need to change 145 applications so they will work on Linux. This will cost millions of Euros,\" he says.\nMigrating those applications will not only take money: it will take time, and because of this, the migration to Linux on the desktop is not due to start for five or six years. But the migration to OpenOffice.org on Windows will begin next year, with 3500 desktops across 40 departments migrated to the open source productivity application by 2009, according to Armbruster: \"The migration to OpenOffice has to end when support for Office 2003 ends \u2014 so we have about four or five years to complete the migration.\"\nArmbruster believes that one of the most important factors for a successful migration is user acceptance. \"It is important for me to have no resistance from users,\" he says. It is so important that the Mannheim IT department is providing every city employee with copies of OpenOffice.org and Linux for their home PC and will even provide support for home users.\n\"Most of the problems in Munich are due to resistance from users \u2014 they don't want to change to Linux,\" says Armbruster. \"It's important for an open source project that you inform your users \u2014 you need to talk with users and speak about their problems.\"\nHe is confident that this won't happen with Mannheim's migration. \"We haven't seen any resistance from users in the city of Mannheim. We have talked with department managers and power users and they accept our strategy to slowly move to Linux,\" he says.\nThe problems with Munich's migration to open source encouraged Armbruster to publicise Mannheim's migration \u2014 to show that open source can work.\n\"Microsoft is probably very happy about the project in Munich because of its"}

Current single Maneater, with its radio-happy chorus powered by a grinding oily bass; No Hay Igual\u2019s Latin street hop; and a clutch of frisky, body-popping tracks suggest that the notion of Nelly as world music\u2019s answer to Missy is only faintly ridiculous.

On the one hand as a society with are being more and more careless with our private data, sharing everything from photos, running stats, contacts and much more on the internet without a care in the world, on the other we are becoming more and more aware that we are being watched by \"big brother\" as stories like PRISM and the work of Edward Snowdon continue to make headlines.\nPerhaps capitalising on this, or the continual decline and demise of BlackBerry, a new security focused offering has come on to the market - this time for Android users.\n\"We wanted to deliver not just the best privacy, but the best total package,\u201d said Toby Weir-Jones, SGP Technologies\u2019 Managing Director, the company behind the device.\nDubbed the Blackphone and available in the summer, the new phone will have security and encryption at the heart of what it does, like nothing you would have seen before, making services like Samsung's Knox or BlackBerry's Enterprise Server efforts look decidedly rudimentary.\nThere are two elements to the Blackphone.\nThe first is the handset. It is a fairly low-key looking device with a mid-range spec sheet to match. A 2 Ghz quad-core processor married with 2GB of RAM and a 4.7-inch HD IPS display, the phone comes with 16GB of memory, LTE support and 8 megapixel camera.\nThe small company has opted to make the phone themselves rather than just provide software so it can control the encryption and security elements a lot tighter and that means that you have to go with what it's created rather than simply running this off a shiny new Samsung Galaxy S5 or a Sony Xperia Z2.\nThe main focus though is the software that has been drilled into the Android operating system blocking out cross sharing of data and even making sure your calls are encrypted up to the point of hitting the phone network. This is proper Enemy of the State stuff.\nOnce you've gone through the opening salvo of setup instructions (similar but slightly different to Android's standard setup) you can start setting up the range of Silent Circe services that come with the phone.\nSilent Circle, a third-party subscription service allows users to make phone calls, and send text or video chats with another Silent Circle members. The transmission is secured and encrypted end-to-end from the device to other Silent Circle users whether they are also on a Blackphone, iPhone, or other Android device.\nTo get you started you get two years of Silent Circle, three years of Friends and Family Silent Circle subscriptions, two years of Disconnect, and two years of SpiderOak, and other features like the ability to manage Wi-Fi all of which when added together make for an incredibly secure and private offering.\nIf you aren't really sure what any of that does or means, don't worry. The end combination of the software means you can ban apps from accessing location or your contacts or even stopping the phone looking for Wi-Fi hotspots that you haven't set.\nSilent Circle's applications can only offer peer-to-peer encryption when you're calling another Silent Circle user, and you need to pay Silent Circle to be a user - which you get free with the phone for the first couple of years, but the people you phone will either also have to have bought the phone, or subscribed to the Silent Circle service. That costs $10 a month.\nThe blackphone isn't going to be for everyone, but the people that really feel they need to worry about the emails they"}

Gilmore doesn\u2019t believe in the notion Montreal is a one-sport city that only cares about the Canadiens.\nThe Impact have players from Canada, the U.S., France, England, Argentina, Nigeria, Finland and Uganda. Gilmore\u2019s job is to make those players better known in the city while attracting more fans to Saputo Stadium, which has a capacity of 20,801.\nThe Impact will introduce a pregame ritual Saturday in which fans are invited to greet the players about 90 minutes before kickoff when they arrive in the northeast corner of Saputo Stadium and ring the 1642MTL fan group\u2019s North Star Bell as they walk toward the locker room. There will also be a 2-for-1 special on all drinks at the stadium\u2019s concession stands from 11 a.m. until noon.\nGilmore said more than 18,000 tickets have been sold for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\u201cI think for those that have never been, the soccer experience is unparalleled,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting: I tell people when I was with the Canadiens I kept saying: How can we bring a little bit of that Impact atmosphere \u2014 or soccer atmosphere \u2014 into the Bell Centre.

The move has been taken in response to growing concern over the marine damage caused by plastic waste, which a report published recently by the U.N. Environment Programme puts at $13 billion or more annually.\nAmong the products that will be removed from Illinois shelves are several brands of exfoliating face wash. While natural versions of this popular product use the likes of oatmeal or ground kernels as an exfoliant, cheap commercial varieties use nonbiodegradable plastic beads, known as microbeads. One average-sized tube can hold thousands of them.\nBecause of their size \u2014 less than a millimeter across \u2014 microbeads are not sifted out from wastewater during the sewage-treatment process, but instead end up being released into large bodies of water, like the Great Lakes, where they cause irreparable harm. One California-based institute found almost 470,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer of the Great Lakes, and most of them (81%) were microbeads. Fish and birds think the beads are food and end up eating them, often with lethal consequences.\nNew York, Ohio and California are expected to follow Illinois\u2019s lead. According to a report released by New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman, 19 tons of microbeads are released into New York wastewater annually.

Your knees are essential to movement. If you\u2019re dealing with chronic knee pain, here\u2019s some advice.\nMetzl says every day in my office, he sees people coming in with achy knees, from 8-year-old gymnasts to 82-year-old marathon runners. No matter their age, each of his patients has a common objective, they want to keep moving.\nCommon Knee Pain from a Growth Spurt. This causes a loss of muscle flexibility and a pulling or pain sensation at the growth plate in the knee called Osgood-Schlatter. Knee issues are most common in teen athletes during periods of growth (for girls, age 10-14; for boys, age 12-14). How to fix it: The ways to fix a knee with Osgood-Schlatter include getting on a foam roller to loosen the muscles around the leg and using a knee strap to keep the pressure off of the tibial tubercle, the area of the knee that is made of cartilage and hurts with jumping and running.\nRunner\u2019s Knee. Runner\u2019s knee is the most common cause of knee pain in young adults. It is caused by the kneecap (patella) rubbing against the femur (thigh). You don\u2019t have to be a runner to get runner\u2019s knee. The classic symptoms are an ache underneath your kneecap as you go up and down the stairs. This issue commonly occurs in active people, age 20-60. How to fix it: The ways to fix runner\u2019s knee include building up the muscles in the leg which helps the patella stop rubbing against the femur bone and also shortening your walking or running stride. When the stride is shortened it puts less loading force on the patella and the pain reduces.\nMonster walks: Get a resistance band and put it around both ankles. Then slightly bend your knees and take small steps sideways. This is a great way to build the muscles on the sides of the hip, and thus, supporting the knee.\nSquatting from a chair: This is a great way to safely squat, and a great way to start building the quads and hips. Stand in front of the chair with your arms out straight and sit back until you feel the chair, then come back up. Don\u2019t get too comfy, the key is to lightly touch the chair and come back up.\nBiking: This a great way to keep the knees and hips moving while also building strength. He recommends 30 minutes a day, as often as you can.\nDr. Jordan Metzl is a renowned sports medicine physician at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. In addition to his medical practice, he is the author of five books about the intersection of fitness and medicine including The Athlete\u2019s Book of Home Remedies.

Those who can do it cheaper would get additional funding from the government.\n\"Patients will have greater choice about where they can access the best quality treatment,\" Lt.-Gov. David Onley said in the throne speech.\nOntario's outdated hospital system will be modernized with a bill that \"taps into the expertise of community partners and all health-care professionals\" while an expert panel drafts guidelines on patient care, he said.\nLegislation will also be introduced to make health-care providers and executives accountable for improving patient care, Onley said.\nFor example, hospital executives would see their bonuses tied to hospital performance, such as lowering wait times or C. difficile rates, government officials said. Hospitals may also be compelled to publicly report other indicators of patient safety, they added.\nOntario needs to be smarter with its health-care cash, which accounts for nearly half of every dollar it spends, Premier Dalton McGuinty said following the speech.\nThe expert panel will ensure that Ontarians get \"all the health care they need, and no more than the health care they need,\" he added.\nFor example, hospitals around the world already follow certain rules when a patient comes in with a hurt ankle, he said.\n\"Unless there are certain indications are there, you're not getting an X-ray,\" he said. \"You don't want an X-ray because you don't want to wait in line for an X-ray. I don't want to give you an X-ray because it costs too much money.\"\nAs for hospitals competing for cash, McGuinty said he's merely expanding the so-called \"patient-based\" payment model that's used in half of Ontario's 154 hospitals to reduce wait times for certain procedures, such as cataract surgery.\nForcing hospitals to underbid each other for services will hurt small and rural communities that can't compete with their big-city counterparts, leaving patients to travel further for care, said Natalie Mehra of the Ontario Health Coalition.\nWhen a similar plan was introduced in the United Kingdom about a decade ago, it led to a host of new administrative costs and massive privatization of hospitals services, she said.\n\"They are playing with fire,\" she said.\n\"There is little that will galvanize Ontarians as much as forcing them into an impossible situation where they cannot access health-care services from their local communities.\"\nIt's an \"interesting\" idea, but the government isn't saying which procedures will be included, said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.\n\"What I don't want to see is the government using any kind of model to simply pull all kinds of money out and create a situation where people don't have access to good health care close to home,\" she added.\nOthers argue the patient-based payment model will create a more efficient system and encourage hospitals to improve patient care.\nSmall hospitals and teaching hospitals would need to be funded differently, however, because they don't have enough volume to compete for cash, said Tom Closson, president of the Ontario Hospital Association.\n\"But with those provisos, the concept makes a lot of sense,\" he said.\nThe proposed changes come amid concerns"}

In some cases, they could not even receive mobile service where they lived.\nACCAN director of policy Una Lawrence said the issue was \"systemic\", with almost 70 cases on the books of vulnerable, remote Australians being sold plans they can't afford by different telecommunications companies. More recently, this includes customers in the APY Lands in northern South Australia, in areas that have only recently obtained mobile coverage.\n\"It's unconscionable. [Telcos] seem to have a one-size-fits-all approach for selling ... that is inappropriate for vulnerable consumers,\" Ms Lawrence told Fairfax Media.\n\"These are often people with poor literacy, without English as a first language or with a different cultural approach and this isn't sufficiently taken into consideration,\" she said. \"Some of them don't understand what excess data charges are.\"\nShe also warned against a \"quick check on the computer\" for a credit rating as the financial assessment undertaken by sales staff, describing it as \"inadequate\".\n\"These are not easy issues. This group of people is being treated very poorly, we need a more sensitive and nuanced approach that inquires a bit further,\" she said.\nA Telstra spokesman said its monitoring processes earlier this year led to the \"identification of potential concerns with sales activities at our Broome Store\" and after a review of the practices, two employees were dismissed for not following processes.\n\"We have apologised to the customers affected and waived the fees and charges relating to their services,\" the spokesman said, describing it as \"disappointing\".\nACCAN is hoping these \u201chorrific cases of overselling to vulnerable consumers\u201d and \"pushy sales tactics\" from telcos will be dealt with in a current review of the telecommunications consumer protection code, saying there are some issues of \"interpretation\" in the existing code.\nA separate submission, from the Consumer Action Law Centre (CALC) and Melbourne-based Westjustice, warned target- and commission-based selling \u201ccreates perverse incentives and puts profit before good consumer outcomes\u201d.\nIn one case described in the joint submission, provided to Fairfax Media, a woman was cold-called for a phone plan upgrade while she was in a psychiatric ward and on medication.

A national group funded in part by large corporate donations kicked in nearly $1 million to keep him on the bench and narrowly prevailed.\nDark money can be dangerous in judicial races.\nThe U.S. is in an era of high-priced judicial elections. It's hard to see how we can have judicial independence when judges depend on a handful of big donors to get them elected. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized this, ruling that judges must recuse themselves when a case involves their giant donors.\nBut how can a person litigating a case ask the judge to recuse him or herself if the litigant doesn't know that the opponent secretly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the judge elected?\nWith the sharp rise in dark money \u2014 spending by outside groups that do not coordinate with candidates and do not have to disclose their donors \u2014 this demands an answer.\nSpending on judicial elections has soared in recent decades, including election spending by organizations that don't coordinate with a candidate or party. In 2014, trial lawyers opposed to the retention of Illinois Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Karmeier spent roughly $2 million to defeat him. The Republican State Leadership Committee, a national political committee supporting candidates for state office, spent nearly $1 million to help Karmeier, who narrowly won retention. The RSLC received large donations from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA.\nThere's a simple answer to the hard question of what to do about dark money in judicial elections: Litigants (and their lawyers) should be required to disclose their contributions to influence any judicial election. This is a straightforward rule that would apply to trial lawyers and corporate defendants, and everyone else before the bar.\nIf a person or business files a case or is a defendant, they and their attorneys should report to the courts all of their spending on judicial elections \u2014 including donations to outside groups that spend money to influence judicial elections. The courts would maintain a publicly available, centralized website. That would get campaign spending information to the litigants and the public.\nDoes campaign spending really bias judges? Smaller amounts probably don't pose much of a problem. But the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that concentrated spending on judicial elections by litigants poses the danger of undue influence over judges, whether the judges are conscious of bias or not.\nIn the 2009 case Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to rule on a West Virginia case where Don Blankenship, then the CEO of Massey, spent $3 million on a state Supreme Court race. Blankenship knew at the time that the Supreme Court would soon hear an appeal of a case in which a $50 million verdict had been rendered against Massey. Blankenship's preferred candidate won, and then voted to overturn the $50 million verdict.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held that the risk of bias was too high to be constitutionally tolerable. The court held, \"We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias \u2014 based on objective and reasonable perceptions \u2014 when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge's election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\"\nMega-spending on judicial elections creates problems that are not easily solved."}

Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked secret documents about National Security Agency surveillance in 2013 and is living in Russia as a fugitive from criminal charges.\nThe start of the campaign coincides with the theatrical release this week of the movie \u201cSnowden,\u201d a sympathetic, fictionalized version of his story by the director Oliver Stone. Together, the film and the campaign, called \u201cPardon Snowden,\u201d opened a new chapter in the debate about the surveillance Mr. Snowden revealed and about whether his leaks will go down in history as whistle-blowing or treason.\nThe campaign, organized by the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, includes a petition that has been signed by technologists, law professors and celebrities. At a news conference, Mr. Snowden appeared by remote video link, thanking the organizers and arguing that his fate will have a broader impact.\n\u201cIf we are to sustain a free society through the next century, we must ensure that whistle-blowers can act again, and safely, as a check on future abuses of power,\u201d Mr. Snowden said. If he is sentenced to a long prison term, he added, people in the future who have information that the public needs to know will be afraid to come forward.\nThe chances that Mr. Obama will issue a pardon appear slim. In late July, Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, rejected the idea as she responded on behalf of the administration to a two-year-old petition on the White House\u2019s website that asked the president to pardon him.\nMr. Snowden said he could not receive a fair trial because he was charged under the Espionage Act, which does not permit defendants to argue to the jury that they should be acquitted because their whistle-blowing served the public interest.\nIn June 2013, soon after The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing revelations about secret N.S.A. surveillance and data collection programs, Mr. Snowden identified himself as the source of the information. He was in Hong Kong, and he later sought to travel to Latin America via Moscow and Cuba. But the State Department revoked his passport, stranding him in Russia.\nLast year, an appeals court ruled that the first program he revealed \u2014 the N.S.A.\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 domestic phone records \u2014 was illegal. Congress last year ended that program, replacing it with one in which the bulk data stays in the hands of phone companies.\nIn addition, many technology companies have increased the security of their products in response to his disclosures about the N.S.A.\u2019s widespread surveillance of the internet in operations overseas, where few domestic legal limits apply; its efforts to weaken encryption; and its hacking operations.\nCritics of Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures maintain that they have made it harder to gather intelligence about foreign adversaries and terrorists, and even for law enforcement officials to carry out court-approved wiretapping on ordinary criminal suspects.\nMr. Snowden signed off before the news conference was over. His lawyer, Ben Wizner, said he needed to perform technical checks for another event on Wednesday in which he was scheduled to appear remotely with Mr. Stone and the actor who portrays him in \u201cSnowden,\u201d Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\nThe movie presents Mr. Snowden \u2014 who appears in person in its final scene \u2014 in starkly heroic terms, mixing accurate re-creations of people, historical events and N.S.A"}
{"idx": "10616", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: School opened this week, so I thought this exploration would be appropriate and valuable.\nRecently, I was conducting a class on business communication, and a participant brought up what might be new trend in customer service. A similar idea had been suggested in an earlier MBA graduate class I was teaching, so I suspect there might be something going on in the business world that could be worth considering. Like most \"new\" items, this one has both good and bad aspects to it.\nThe new trend relates to what is happening in large call centers.\nA call center representative can talk to only one customer at a time. That means this is a very labor-intensive business. It's easy to see how the ebb and flow of call volume can influence the size of the call center work force.\nWith expanding use of the Internet, however, more customers are using e-mail and instant messaging to communicate with companies. Call center operators, likewise, are using this development to their advantage.\nWith instant messaging, call center operators can now handle two, three, or four calls at the same time. They can carry on written conversations with many more people than was ever possible on the telephone. Communicating with four customers simultaneously can provide much faster service, and that's what customers want.\nThat's the good news, but here's the bad news part to this trend. As some call centers have made this shift, they are realizing that many representatives who worked the phones well have difficulty writing well. Effective communication with clients is suffering.\nBeing able to talk well and being able to write well require two totally different sets of skills. Further, the permanency of speech and writing are very different. If someone makes an error while speaking, the error is gone in an instant. If, however, someone makes an error in print, that error lives forever.\nWe all know that how we communicate in business reflects on us personally, and it reflects on our companies.\nPoor writing reflects poorly on every company that allows it.\nThis difficulty with writing ability, of course, exists with customers as well as with the call center personnel; but companies can't do anything to control or improve the skills of their customers. They can and should, however, improve the skills of their work force because of the importance of the messages they are sending to customers.\nMany call center operators are looking to develop writing classes for their representatives so they can effectively use instant messaging. These won't be \"going back to school\" remedial classes filled with grammar rules and memorization, but it's a chance to revisit some of the basic skills we all struggled with in the past.\nIn many cases when we got out of school we stopped paying close attention to what we learned in English grammar class.\nThose old rules, however, still apply today. Whether or not we like to admit it, we are still judged by our writing skills. The companies we represent are also judged by what we do.\nIf you are in a position to do so, help your work force make a brief visit to \"Grammarland\". Encourage employees to pay attention once again to such things as: agreement of subject and predicate, antecedents of pronouns, number, gender, case, sentence fragments and accurate punctuation.

(AP) \u2014 John Elway insists Joe Flacco is at the top of his game at age 34 even though the former Baltimore Ravens quarterback hasn\u2019t thrown a pass in the playoffs since 2015.\nThat echoed comments Elway made Wednesday when he told the NFL Network that Flacco\u2019s \u201carm strength is still great\u201d and \u201che\u2019s just going into his prime,\u201d even though the veteran QB was supplanted by rookie Lamar Jackson last season and didn\u2019t play in the Ravens\u2019 wild-card loss to the Chargers.\nElway, who sent a fourth-round pick to Baltimore for Flacco in a deal worked out five weeks ago, trusts he\u2019s finally found a worthy successor to Peyton Manning \u2014 another Super Bowl winner who came to Denver for the second chapter of his storied career.\nFlacco said he\u2019d love to reach out to Manning as he tries to follow his lead in Denver.\nIt also appears Elway is trying hard to sell his latest quarterback acquisition to an antsy and skeptical fan base that has suffered through Mark Sanchez\u2019s flop, Trevor Siemian\u2019s fall, Brock Osweiler\u2019s flounder, Paxton Lynch\u2019s fiasco, Case Keenum\u2019s failure and Chad Kelly\u2019s flameout in the three years since Manning retired.\nNo matter the motivation, Flacco appreciates Elway\u2019s endorsement .\nFlacco, who\u2019s 7\u00bd years younger than Brady, said he\u2019s healthy and hardy and can\u2019t wait to get going.\nFlacco, whose last playoff appearance was a 35-31 loss at New England on Jan. 10, 2015, has three years and $63 million left on his contract with a 2019 salary of $18.5 million.\nFlacco missed just six games in his first decade in the NFL and was Baltimore\u2019s starter last season until he injured his right hip in a loss at Pittsburgh on Nov. 4. Jackson took over and went 6-1 to get the Ravens into the playoffs for the first time since the 2014 season.\nThe Ravens went 106-72 with Flacco as a starter, including the postseason, where his 10 playoff victories since 2008 rank second behind Brady among active quarterbacks. Nobody has more road playoff wins than Flacco\u2019s seven.\nFlacco heaved a 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones in the final minute of regulation when safety Rahim Moore mistimed his jump while going for the interception instead of the tackle. That play represents the Broncos\u2019 Bill Buckner moment and it propelled the Ravens to their second Super Bowl title a month later.\nFlacco said he\u2019s still driven by his love for the game, not by his disappointing end in Baltimore.\nNotes: The Broncos re-signed TE Jeff Heuerman to a two-year deal worth about $9 million."}

In some countries we are the market leader. In some categories, if we are not the market leader yet, we will be. In the Middle East we are on the right way. We know [adidas] have been here for a long time, but I think there will be a competition between the two brands.\"\nNike had, until recently, been primarily associated with basketball, a sport that is far from dominant in the Middle East. Adidas had always chosen to focus on football, using ambassadors such as Beckham, Kaka and Lionel Messi to sell their merchandise. Unsurprisingly then, with football the undisputed No1 sport across the Gulf, Nike has identified the beautiful game as a key area on which to focus.\n\"There are four key categories: football, running, women&apos;s fitness and lifestyle. Each of these have different timescales, but we believe \u2013 and I am positive \u2013 that we will dominate in the Middle East,\" added Hamori.\nNike Inc, which posted a turnover of more than $10 billion (Dh36.7bn) in 2008, has set itself an arduous challenge in becoming the market leader for football in the region. But if it is looking for an ambassador to market its products, it would struggle to better the potential of current clients Cristiano Ronaldo and Fernando Torres.\nManchester United midfielder Ronaldo, who was last month voted World Player of the Year, is a long-term partner of Nike, while Torres, who helped his country Spain win the European Championships last year, has been on Nike&apos;s radar since competing in an Under 15 Nike Cup in 1998."}

Children between the ages of 8 and 15, who were living in a refugee camp at the time, reported that they were forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for food and other goods. Fourteen French soldiers reportedly were suspected of being involved.\nAfter speaking to UNICEF representative in CAR who said that the children are cared for and followed up with, investigative reporter Karin Mattisson and her team spoke to children who said otherwise. One such survivor is Martha who became pregnant and contracted HIV by a peacekeeping soldier when she was 14-years-old.\n\u201cInitially, UNICEF said that they would make sure that the soldier was imprisoned and take care of the mother and baby to help us. But then, nothing, no one came to visit. It was left to us to take care of the child,\u201d her friend said. Martha said that all they received was a \u201cpresent\u201d of money equivalent to US$15, a bag of rice, milk and sugar. Meanwhile, the peacekeeper was sent home and it is uncertain if any punitive action was taken.\nIn response to the allegations, UNICEF spokesperson Najwa Mekki told IPS that the agency has provided assistance to children whose cases they are aware of and that they have scaled up their reporting procedures, victim assistance, and staff capacity since 2015.\n\u201cWe are following up on the children identified in the Swedish TV programme, providing assistance when appropriate, and will continue to give the necessary support to any victim of sexual exploitation and abuse who comes forward or is brought to our attention,\u201d she told IPS.\nFormer Under-Secretary General and High Representative of the UN Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, who is also involved in the Code Blue Campaign, noted that UN bureaucracy often stands in the way of action by preventing clear and concise information on such cases to travel up the chain of command.\n\u201cFinally when it reaches the Secretary General, [information] is already absolutely diluted,\u201d he told IPS. And without complete evidence, any investigation becomes a \u201csham inquiry,\u201d Chowdhury added.\nDespite steps taken by the UN to address the scandal in 2015, including the creation of a review panel which characterized the UN\u2019s response to sexual exploitation and abuse as a \u201cgross institutional failure,\u201d little to no punitive action has been taken.\nMost recently in January, a French investigation into the cases closed without anyone being charged. Senior UN officials accused of abuse of authority for suppressing information rather than reporting cases have also remained largely untouched, Donovan said, adding that the initial \u201cgross institutional failure\u201d has only continued.\n\u201cJustice is being delayed and it is being denied,\u201d Chowdhury told IPS.\nDonovan also pointed to the problematic use of \u201cUN insiders\u201d"}

Give them an iPad 2 instead.\nDespite being a more recent release, the new iPad mini packs the same 1024x768 display that's found in the iPad 2.\nIn fact, everything about the iPad mini, from its screen resolution to its performance, is comparable to the iPad 2; the only difference is that it's smaller.\nAnd yet, at $329 for the 16GB model, the iPad mini costs $10 more than a refurbished iPad 2 16GB WiFi Tablet.\nWe thus recommend opting for the latter, which comes in immaculate condition from Apple with the same 1-year warranty, as well as more screen real estate for media streaming, all for $10 less than the mini.\nThey want a NOOK HD? Give them a Kindle Fire HD instead.\nMake no mistake, the NOOK HD is a perfectly capable tablet with very similar performance and features to its rival, the Kindle Fire HD.\nHowever, when it comes to the ecosystem of each, Amazon has the upper hand.\nThe store has more consistently offered aggressive pricing on media like eBooks and MP3s, it has a more robust app marketplace, and Fire owners can stream Prime-related film and TV whenever they want.\nMoreover, Barnes & Noble is experiencing a slowdown in its core business of book-selling, which financially affects the NOOK and its supporting services; meanwhile, Amazon is enjoying record-breaking sales of its Kindle devices.\nAs a result, Amazon's Kindle Fire environment will continue to flourish and will likely remain stronger than that of the Barnes & Noble NOOK.\nThey want an iPhone 5? Give them an iPhone 4 or 4S instead.\nWhile it's now possible to find deals on a refurb iPhone 5, when it comes to saving money, the iPhone 4 and 4S are still your best options.\nLike the iPhone 5, both models can run iOS 6, however, the 4S now retails for $100 less.\nWe've even seen deals that drop to as low as $1 (with a 2-year contract).\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 4 is always available for free with a contract, and both previous generations see more deals than the iPhone 5 does.\nThey want a handheld game console? Give them an iPod touch instead.\nBecause of the smartphone, there are numerous small devices that now seem unnecessary, like the handheld game console.\nSure, there will always be Nintendo 3DS and Playstation Vita fans, but a device like the WiFi-enabled iPod touch now satisfies the desires of most casual gamers with its endless library of games, which now includes popular console franchises like EA's FIFA 13 Soccer, Assassin's Creed, and Call of Duty.\nPrice-wise, these apps are considerably cheaper and are more readily discounted than games for the Nintendo "}

Legal experts say it is unlikely the court will grant the review, known as an en banc hearing.\nChristopher Seeger, the co-lead counsel for the majority of players who are supporting the settlement, called Thursday's appeal \"meritless\" and said it would have \"devastating consequences\" for suffering retirees.\n\"They will be forced to wait even longer for the immediate care and support they need and deserve,\" Seeger said in a statement. \"This latest appeal is heartbreaking news for the 99 percent of the retired player community that has supported this agreement. We will continue to forcefully defend this important settlement through the appeals process.\"\nThe settlement covers about 20,000 retired players, and could cost the NFL more than a billion dollars while protecting the league from future litigation. The settlement has been in the works since March 2015, when U.S. District Court Anita Brody of Pennsylvania approved it as a suitable end to a class-action suit against the league. A small subset of players objected, but the Third Circuit's panel affirmed Brody's decision on April 18.\nIn Thursday's filing, Pentz argued that settlement could not be justified given how little is known about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease afflicting scores of former NFL players, as well as athletes from other contact sports like hockey."}

In recent years overseas sellers, particularly from China, have come to dominate many popular goods categories on eBay and Amazon, illegally selling products into the UK without paying VAT. As a result, many small British businesses have been undercut.\nIn April the National Audit Office disclosed that failure to declare tax from online retailers outside the EU lost HM Revenue & Customs up to \u00a31.5bn.\nOn Wednesday Caroline Flint, a Labour member of the committee, repeatedly challenged Joe Billante, an eBay vice-president, and Steve Dishman, a vice-president at Amazon, over their failure to stop fraudsters from using their services.\nShe said both firms were actively encouraging overseas sellers from China to use their platforms and were charging them a fee.\n\u201cWhatever your relationship to the seller, the byproduct of Amazon and eBay and other online marketplaces is that you are profiting from the evading of tax by these overseas sellers. That is a fact, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Flint said.\nDishman acknowledged there was a problem. \u201cWe need all sellers to compete equally. That is what we are focused on,\u201d he said.\nMeg Hiller, the chair of the committee, said both retailers were still taking a commission from overseas-based firms who were defrauding the taxpayer. Online sales accounted for 14.5% of all UK retail sales in 2016, making the UK the biggest online market in Europe after an increase of more than 12 percentage points in a decade.\nJust over half of all online sales were non-store sales, mainly through marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. Some overseas sellers now choose to export their goods to the UK and store them in \u201cfulfilment houses\u201d before selling them to UK consumers through online marketplaces.\nTax rules require that all traders based outside the EU who are selling goods online to customers in the UK should charge VAT if their goods are already in the UK at the point of sale. Amazon and eBay say it is the legal responsibility of the sellers who trade on their platforms to determine and declare any VAT that arises from the sale of goods or services.\nTax officials from HMRC also came in for criticism from MPs for not enforcing the rules effectively enough. Prof Rita de la Feria, a tax expert, told the committee that HMRC\u2019s failings were allowing firms to avoid paying their dues.\nJon Thompson, permanent secretary of the HMRC, called for legal changes to make firms such as Amazon liable for paying some of the VAT.\nRichard Allen, from the campaign group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, said many of the goods that were imported from foreign sellers were dangerous. \u201cTwenty per cent is a large sum of money, and if your competitors are avoiding the 20% you can\u2019t compete,\u201d he added.\nSome of the MPs on the committee said they had completed mystery shopping exercises and found firms without VAT numbers.

Freshman guard Both Gach, whose athletic abilities \u2014 albeit still raw \u2014 could likely give the Utes a bit of a jump-start, was inserted into the starting lineup.\nIt\u2019s not a scenario unfamiliar to Van Dyke, who has been moved in and out of the starting lineup for much of his career at Utah. His skill set as a spot-up shooter isn\u2019t bound or limited by his ability to start a game or play a certain amount of minutes.\nIn fact, teammates say Van Dyke is one of the best shooters they\u2019ve seen in practice, as 3-point shot after 3-point shot rains down at the Huntsman practice facility. In games, too, Van Dyke has improved his 3-point shooting by nearly 10 percent since last season, upping his 3-point percentage per game from 30.7 percent to 40.4 percent, while increasing his average 3-point shot attempts from 2.9 to 5.0 this season.\nSo it came as no surprise that Van Dyke became somewhat of the hero Saturday as he drained a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from about 25 feet out to defeat UCLA 93-92 in a come-from-behind victory. The shot heard around Pauley Pavilion was the final statement to an impressive 22-point comeback victory in a game where Utah never led until the final buzzer sounded.\nVan Dyke, who saw only 18 total minutes of play against the Bruins, subbed into the game at the 13-minute mark in the second half as Utah trailed by 20 and appeared out of any chance of making a comeback. Still, there was plenty of time left in the game, and the Bruins were no longer shooting 70 percent from the field.\nIn a matter of 3 minutes, Van Dyke drained three 3-pointers and got Utah within 14 points, and the Utes got to work at chipping away at the lead. After a brief stint back on the bench, Van Dyke was brought back into the game with 1:33 left as Utah was down by 7 points.\nAnd just like that, Van Dyke hit another 3-pointer and a comeback became a reality with 52 seconds left in the game. His fifth and final 3-pointer was the money shot \u2014 the embodiment of all the hard work he\u2019s put into the program over the years and the dream opportunity for every kid who's ever played basketball and run through that exact scenario in their backyard.\n\u201cI knew that it felt good leaving my hands,\u201d Van Dyke told media after the game. \u201cMy mind was pretty clear and Sedrick (Barefield) made a great pass. I just kind of let it fly.\nRegardless of minutes played, Van Dyke has always been the ultimate team player and has been willing to do whatever necessary to help his team be as competitive as possible, even if it means giving up a starting role"}

It certainly has its faults: most obviously, it provides a little too much information about the vasectomy \u00adMcKibben decided to have in lieu of a second child. But it isn't pious or hectoring; if anything, the author tries overly hard to be tentative, emphasising that he isn't seeking to dictate other people's choices, and doesn't think he has all the answers. The \"maybe\" is right there in the title, after all. McKibben meant it in the sense of \"maybe one child at most\", but it reflects the book's general tone of modesty and equivocation. Maybe One is a suggestion. It's something to think about.\nHe might as well have called for the enforced sterilisation of all men and women of procreating age, along with the outlawing of Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy. The New York Times called him \"sanctimonious\" and \"holier-than-thou\". The Wall Street Journal labelled him an \"extremist\" (their specific objection was that he hadn't mentioned nuclear power as a way to combat global warming, even though Maybe One is a book about parenting). \"So much false information, so many bad ideas, in so few pages,\" another reviewer fumed. Speaking after publication, McKibben observed that Maybe One's subject matter was \"the last remaining taboo thing to talk about\" and in this case the clich\u00e9 seemed justified.\nIn 1998, most people weren't willing to consider any significant lifestyle changes for environmental reasons, let alone cutting back on kids. Much has changed since then, of course, both in terms of the consensus on the threat posed by climate change, and our willingness to make sacrifices in the face of it. But one thing has not: you still won't hear any major environmental campaign group in Britain or the US arguing that, in addition to flying less and recycling more, middle-class westerners should be having fewer children to save the planet. Even commentators who warn of the evils of overpopulation, proudly trumpeting their willingness to raise controversial issues in defiance of \"political correctness\", only rarely emphasise the notion that we \u2013 rather than those in the developing world \u2013 might consider doing less of the populating. For several thorny reasons, family size has become the great unmentionable of the campaign for more environmentally friendly lifestyles. And yet, in the end, it may be the only one that really counts.\nFor all the confusion and sensitivities that \u00adsurround the subject, though, the basic facts are clear. If you live in Britain or the US in 2010, there is nothing you can do to reduce your impact on the environment that even comes close to the effects of having one fewer child.\nThis makes intuitive sense: every new human is a new consumer with their own carbon footprint, along with their own potentially limitless chain of descendants. The year before last, two researchers at Oregon State University, Paul Murtaugh and Michael Schlax, set about trying to put a figure on the idea of \"carbon legacy\", and last summer their results were published in the journal Global Environmental Change. Murtaugh and Schlax started from a simple premise. Assume, they said, that if a woman and a man have a baby, they're each responsible for 50% of that child's lifetime carbon dioxide emissions; and if that child has its own"}

Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes!\nThe game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game\u2014this game mattered. With the win and a Miami loss, Indiana moved back into first place in the East.\nThe starters were healthy, Vogel said, but could very much use another day off ahead of Friday's showdown against the Heat. But more than that\u2014those starters just haven't been very good lately. The Pacers came into the game having lost 12 of their last 19, and this benching was meant to send a message as much as it was to give them a rest.\n\"I've been teasing with it the whole month of March and every time I choose to not rest them and play our guys, (they) play poorly and we have consequences to it,\" Vogel said. \"The way we've been playing over the last month is concerning. The way we played against Atlanta was disturbing and something needs to be done.\"\nBut rather than just punt a game, Vogel played the odds, choosing to sit his starters against the Bucks, who are somehow three games worse than a team that lost 26 in a row. This was a big game for Milwaukee too, in their quest for the first draft pick, and they proved themselves up to the task.\nSo why was Vogel allowed to rest all of his starters, when Gregg Popovich and the Spurs were fined $250,000 for leaving their stars at home for a game at Miami last season? The Pacers claimed they're in the clear because they properly communicated their intentions to the league office. The true answer is that this game wasn't on national TV."}

The poor boys have taken their lumps in \"Hancock,\" \"The Dark Knight\" and even \"Iron Man.\" Self-doubt, angst and inadequacies plague them.\nNow comes \"Watchmen.\" Its costumed superheroes, operating in an alternative 1985, are seriously screwed up \u2014 and so is their movie. If anyone were able to make a nine-figure movie, something like \"Watchmen\" would have been the opening-night film at the Sundance Film Festival.\nAs stimulating as it was to see the superhero movie enter the realm of crime fiction in \"Dark Knight,\" \"Watchmen\" enters a realm that is both nihilistic and campy. The two make odd companions. The film, directed by Zack Snyder (\"300\"), will test the limits of superhero-movie fans. If you're not already invested in these characters because of the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, nothing this movie does is likely to change that.\nThat's bad news for Warner Bros. and Paramount, which hold domestic and international rights, respectively. Opening weekends everywhere will reflect the huge anticipation for this much-touted, news-making movie. After that, the boxoffice slide could be drastic.\nSnyder and writers David Hayter and Alex Tse never find a reason for those unfamiliar with the graphic novel to care about any of this nonsense. And it is nonsense. When one superhero has to take a Zen break, he does so on Mars. Of course he does.\nThe film opens with a brutal killing, then moves on to a credit-roll newsreel of sorts that takes us though the Cold War years, landing us in 1985; Nixon is in his third term, tipping us that we're in an alternate America. Our superheroes have taken care of Woodward and Bernstein, and other forces evidently have taken care of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe opening murder happens to the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), once a member of a now-banished team of superheroes called the Masks. Fellow ex-Mask Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) takes exception to the death. He believes the entire society of ex-crimefighters is being targeted.\nHis investigation and renewed contacts with former buddies fill us in on the complicated histories and problematic psychiatric makeups of these colleagues.\nIt's all very complicated but not impenetrable. We pick up the relationships quickly enough but soon realize these backstories owe more to soap operas than to superhero comics.\nThese superheroes, before Nixon banned them, were more vigilantes than real heroes, so the question the movie poses is: Who is watching these Watchmen? They don't seem too much different from the villains.\nWhich also means we don't empathize with any of these creatures. And what's with the silly Halloween getups?\nThe violence is not as bad as early rumors would have one believe. It's still comic book stuff, only with lots of bloody effects and makeup. The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as \"300\" did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help.\nThere is something lackadaisical here. The set pieces are surprisingly flat, and the characters have little resonance.

{"idx": "10675", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: These are both first novels from Australian writers. In The Singing, a woman spends her days at the window, looking out. In The Rose Notes, a woman spends her days helping to run her father's farm; and whenever she has spare time she follows the cattle tracks that criss-cross the paddocks wherever they lead her.\nThis difference in how they see landscape serves as an image of how differently these novels work. The Singing is precise in its narrow range. It is composed of memories and observations and everywhere the narrator looks she sees her own obsessions, haunting her world like the reflection of a face in glass. The Rose Notes, on the other hand, is like those cattle tracks that Pearl follows: gently involving, rambling and broad-ranging.\nThe Singing takes a quote from Virginia Woolf's essay On Being Ill as its prologue: \"The Public would say that a novel devoted to influenza lacked plot; they would complain that there was no love in it - wrongly however for illness often takes on the guise of love, and plays the same old tricks.\" In this essay, Woolf argues that illness could take love's place as a literary topic.\nBut in The Singing, Stephanie Bishop takes up love and illness together and treats them as aspects of each other. Her narrator suffers a love as enervating as illness and endures an illness as all-encompassing as love.\nWhen Woolf writes on being ill, she describes how it makes you discover yourself as a strange world. She exclaims at \"the undiscovered countries that are then disclosed, what wastes and deserts of the soul a slight attack of influenza brings to light, what precipices and lawns sprinkled with bright flowers a little rise of temperature reveals\". In The Singing, conversely, the narrator describes an illness, like love, that makes the whole strange world an emblem of itself.\nThis is the illusion that gives The Singing its intensity and elusiveness: even the leaves, even the city pigeons, strike the narrator as images of illness and of love. There is none of Woolf's disinterested interest in random life; so, though it takes her essay as its starting point, in the end The Singing comes closest to Anais Nin's style in Under a Glass Bell (1948). It is not so fantastical, perhaps, but it has the same sense of solitariness, giving ordinary life the quality of a dream.\nThe Singing starts at the end, so to speak, with a chance encounter with a former lover. This encounter prompts the narrator to remember how the affair came apart as an illness overcame her. So, like the \"Public\" that Woolf describes, you could complain that The Singing lacks plot. Or you could consider Nin's retort to the same accusation: \"I am always reminded of the interplay between Debussy and Erik Satie: Debussy said to Satie that his compositions had no form. Satie responded by titling one Sonata in the Form of a Pear.\"\nThe Rose Notes, on the other hand, tells a story in the form of a family saga. It describes a family's secrets and loyalties, its gifts and betrayals. It is set on a Riverina farm where Pearl tends and resents her ageing father, Dobie, as he fights to keep control over the farm and Pearl and all the life he feels falling away from him.\nEssentially, The Rose Notes is a story about inheritance; a study of the character, duties, fears and possessions that parents hand their children. In the end, it is a"}

The GR Sport model is a hugely significant car for Toyota, and it will be a litmus test of whether car-nut Toyota boss Akio Toyoda is hitting the right notes with enthusiasts, as he plans to make Toyota a more emotional, appealing brand.\nThe big question is - will hot hatch aficionados take to the Yaris GR Sport\u2019s hybrid powertrain? That\u2019s the same 1.5-litre petrol engine, plus batteries, plus electric motor, that you\u2019ll find in the regular Yaris Hybrid. Will 99hp and all the fuel economy you could reasonably ask for prove a big enough draw for fast hatch fans?\nIt just might, because Toyota is encouraging them to look past the engine, and concentrate on the chassis. There they will find many of the same components as used on the entirely insane Yaris GRMN hot hatch, which was made in a tiny batch of 400 very-limited editions, earlier this year. GRMN stands for Gazoo Racing - Masters of the Nurburgring, and Gazoo Racing is Toyota\u2019s racing and tuning arm, akin to Mercedes\u2019 AMG or Ford\u2019s RS.\nThe GRMN version of the Yaris was a thinly-disguised racing car, with a screaming 1.8-litre supercharged engine and a chassis that made it feel like a 1990s Touring Car. The GR Sport is the beneficiary of all this, getting the same suspension dampers (made by German specialists Sachs), the same 17-inch forged alloy wheels, and the same grippy Bridgestone Potenza RE50 205/45R17 tyres. So while it won\u2019t have a screamer of an engine, it should go round corners pretty rapidly.\nInside, there are high-backed, suede-wrapped bucket seats and the steering wheel from a GT86 sports car. Prices start from \u20ac23,700, and you can order one now.\nAt the same time, Toyota is also introducing a \u20ac19,740 \u2018Y20\u2019 birthday edition. The original first-generation Yaris (only the second-ever Japanese car to win European Car Of The Year) was introduced in late 1998, with the first proper sales in 1999. The Y20 celebration model comes in the same, distinctive, gold metallic paint as that original model used, with the added attraction of a contrast grey roof. Inside, there\u2019s more upmarket trim, and a new infotainment system, which claims improved smartphone connectivity. That will also be available on the rest of the Yaris range."}

She starts her pupils from the age of three \u2013 not in baby classes, but straight into classical ballet curriculum \u2013 Legat System (Russian Classical Ballet). When they are strong enough, approximately at age nine or 10, she puts them en pointe. At the same time, she introduces them to character dance and gradually to modern/contemporary through choreographic workshops and finally, jazz.\nThis is a gradual process which has proved to be incredibly successful with Olivia Dow\u2019s pupils. To prove her point, she decided to work on a project which demonstrated all this in a more understandable, visual way. So the show Fantasyland \u2013 The Danceshow was conceived.\nSince last November, Olivia Dow\u2019s creative husband John has been working on collating numbers with different styles but with a common denominator \u2013 classic rock.

There must have been a lot of thinking behind this new concept. Things were not just happening by chance. The preparations for such a performance must have been phenomenal, including long sleepless nights burning the midnight oil.\nFantasyland - The Danceshow was the first high-tech dance show that I have seen here and it certainly lays the foundations for similar shows in the future. The formula worked and everyone present at Sir Temi Zammit that Sunday evening came out smiling, satisfied and raving about what they had seen and heard.\nOlivia Dow has come a long way since 1993, when she introduced her first 15 pupils as Petit Ballet Russe de Malte. Today, Ballet Russe de Malte is a truly magnificent youth ballet company within the Olivia Dow School of Russian Ballet with a difference!

Under sentencing guidelines, he could have gotten more than 10 years.\nJudge Timothy Brooks set restitution at $660,698, the loss in state money. He also imposed a civil forfeiture of $664,000, which allows the taking of any assets Shelton might have. His prison time will be followed by three years of supervised release. He was ordered to report to prison Oct. 8.\nThe judge faulted Shelton for speaking with pride for his work for Ecclesia College, which paid kickbacks to Shelton, Woods and Rep. Micah Neal for state money it received. Shelton was paid by Ecclesia through a firm he set up called Paradigm Strategic Consulting.\n\"The illusion that you created this company and you provided fund-raising services, does not go very far with this court,\" Brooks said. The scheme was meant to funnel money to Woods. At the time, Ecclesia had its own professional fundraiser on staff. Brooks told Shelton that \"whatever time you spent Googling\" the names of potential donors for Ecclesia \"wasn't worth $50,000.\" Shelton has contended he was a legitimate fund-raising consultant., but most of his success came in securing state grant money arranged by Woods and other legislators.\nThe judge said Shelton's words demonstrated remorse but that his acceptance of responsibility was lacking and his statement was carefully worded to not admit guilt. He gave him some credit for family testimony, but said that fact cut both ways. \"Things shouldn't have turned out this way with you. You had a very good foundation,\" Brooks said. He said he thought the guideline range was a little high and Shelton's crime didn't rise to the level of Woods'. But he said deterrence was important.\nUnder federal rules, Shelton will have to serve most of the six years. He is expected to appeal.\nSimilar to yesterday in the Wood's sentencing, the morning was filled with an evidentiary hearing concerning facts that were not considered during Shelton's trial but were deemed relevant during sentencing, specifically concerning the alternative medicine nonprofit Arkansas Health Economic Research. We've written previously about the General Improvement Funds steered to this kooky outfit.\nThe other crucial issue has been trying to determine the loss amount, which is important for sentencing purposes. The defense made two key objections: They objected to the inclusion of the AHER and how the loss had been calculated. But the judge overruled objections in both instances.\nThe total loss amount for purposes of sentencing is $660,698, which includes GIF money funneled to Ecclesia and, to a much lesser degree, AHER. Like with Woods, it's a significant point enhancement in terms of the federal guidelines to be convicted for misusing an amount this large.\nShelton addressed the court. He said he remained proud of the work he'd done with Ecclesia and the mission of the college. He said he was ashamed he contributed to its tarnishing. \"If I could do anything different, it would be my misguided friendship with Jon Woods,\" he said. Shelton was best man at Woods' wedding. Woods also introduced him to his wife, he said. He asked for leniency.\nShelton's mother spoke for her son. She was emotional and said he was a good husband and great father and pleaded for mercy.

Education-based applications and popular games are some of the biggest reasons kids get on the computer, and the various dangers of the Internet are one of the biggest reasons parents shy away from granting free-reign access. Such is where the MiiPC comes in. This small desktop PC, which is a cube scarcely larger than a softball, is aimed at families with young children, and offers, among other things, parental controls and runs on Android Jelly Bean. Read our full SlashGear review to find out what all the MiiPC has to offer.\nThe MiiPC is a very simple desktop. Starting with the design, users get a cube with top and bottom plates that are angled inwards \u2014 while it makes it slightly awkward to place in a setup that contains other oddly-shaped set-top boxes and whatnot, the shape effectively disperses light: blue on the top from the power button, and green on the bottom from a large LED light bar.\nThe entirely unit is made from plastic, with an SD card slot being the only port on the front. The rest of the ports, of which you get three USB ports, one HDMI port, Ethernet, an audio-out jack, and a microphone-in jack, are located on the back in a vented plastic grille. The entire bottom of the MiiPC also features a grille plate that allows for additional ventilation, as well as four rubber feet to keep it stable.\nNeither outer edges feature any ports, and the top is home only to the power button, which is smooth and touch-activated. As far as the power button goes, this is my only complaint of the otherwise wonderfull little device \u2014 it is touch-activated, but the activation part of that equation isn\u2019t always so simple. I found myself tapping, touching, and swiping in different manners and lengths of time to get the PC to turn on, at one point even changing outlets in wonder of whether the present one was faulty. After turning the device on and off a few times, I\u2019ve mostly got the activity of turning it on down (using my thumb, pressed flat and held still, for about three seconds seems to do the trick), but turning it off is still a task I\u2019m yet to master, and the last time I tried, I found unplugging the power cable from the back to be a more convenient option.\nAs far as physical setup goes, it is as easy as plugging in an HDMI cable, USB mouse, and turning the computer on.\nWhen you first turn the device on, you\u2019re asked to choose between either the standard Android launcher or the MiiPC Launcher, and to then select the familiar \u201cAlways\u201d or \u201cJust once\u201d. I chose \u201cJust once\u201d for the MiiPC Launcher so I could go back and try later with the other launcher, but choosing this option caused the dialog box to keep reappearing, starting the process over. After three times of this, a little advisement box showed up telling me that I had to click \u201cAlways\u201d to proceed. C\u2019est la vie.\nNote: We spoke to the MiiPC\u2019s founder, Young Song, earlier this year, and he gave us the low-down on the device, as well as a walkthrough of its interface.\nAt this point, you\u2019ll be prompted to sign in to your MiiPC account, or to create one if you haven\u2019t already. You\u2019ll need to be connected to the Internet to do this if you haven\u2019t connected an Ethernet cable already. For this part, I exited the screen instead of"}

But there are seven namely instances where it is not only unforgivable but considered deadly: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, wrath, greed, and sloth.\nOf the deadly transgressions, sloth is what Italian Professor Maria Giribaldi claims to witness the most from her classes.\n\"In my classes there's a lot of immaturity,\" said Giribaldi. \"And usually it comes the moment of the final grade when they think they should have more. But they don't deserve it because they don't go to the lab, they don't do the work, they don't even pay attention in class.

Before Amazon Go, nobody believed artificial neural networks were already ripe to enable such functionalities. Although it is still doubtful, the experiment is gaining momentum.\nHave you ever envisioned an ideal picture with no queues, check-out lines, and shopping carts? Initially, Amazon\u2019s promises of smooth connection with the store\u2019s smartphone app, and accurate charging for selected goods sounded doubtful but appealing. In-store customer experience also seemed admirable: the option of moving items to and out of a shopping bag \u2013 no shop assistants, but hosts of cameras throughout the store instead \u2013 seemed absolutely fantastic.\nThe great job of Amazon\u2019s engineers has put the idea of an innovative user-friendly and completely transparent e-commerce infrastructure into practice. Amazon has always been known for the avant-garde AI expertise. And the recent breakthrough in deep learning made this rise of AI in the e-commerce industry possible. New-gen artificial neural networks, employed by Amazon, encompass from hundreds to thousands of neural layers. The computer vision system is able to monitor each customer, product, shopping time, etc., and support all supply-related logistics several times more effective than any manager. It means Amazon possesses the technology of controlling the human factor, which itself is a leap in the automation of simple processes, i.e. the work of cashiers, store assistants, and security guards.\nThe preliminary results of the experiment turned to be rosy to a lesser extent. Journalists and ordinary customers have tested the new store and found system imperfections. Errors can result in the system allowing customers to leave without paying. Or it can charge for an item a customer actually did not put in the bag. These bugs may seem not a big deal compared to the perks of the totally revamped shopping experience. But such issues jeopardize customers\u2019 trust in the system. In case you as a customer have to double-check transaction or verify your virtual shopping cart, you feel like someone has stolen your joy. Perhaps, customers\u2019 trust is currently the main issue for Amazon to improve.\nAmazon Go is not the first to pioneer cashier-free stores. However, as the leader of the AI-powered market, Amazon can afford the large-scale experiment. The recently launched store is not without its flaws. Amazon Go has inherited such disadvantages of brick-and-mortar stores as shoplifting issues. Despite an array of cameras supervising the store, the system could return errors processing the cases when cameras can\u2019t detect customers\u2019 faces. One can only guess what could happen in case a checkout-free store becomes a target for shoplifters and professional hackers.\nWhat if you\u2019re shopping with someone else, but you\u2019re holding their stuff?\nWhat if a child grabs items and tries to take them out of the store?\nWhat if your smartphone had been stolen and someone went shopping using your account?\nIn case your smartphone was stolen right in the store \u2013 many reasons for that \u2013 how to get through the hi-tech gates?\nWhat if you entered the store, just for the ride, without a smartphone?\nIn case you enter for the ride and decide to make a purchase a bit after, what are you to do?\nAmazon looks beyond all e-commerce retail solutions and platforms we have witnessed before.

This brazen, political ploy shored up Obama\u2019s re-election bid , and contorted Romney to make nice to Hispanic voters, yet at the same time pledged \u201cSelf-Deport\u201d as the final immigration policy.\nA hostile, cultural takeover is infiltrating California, from school system to bureaucracy, and is now infecting Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. Even in Oregon, where I was celebrating Christmas with family, residents are frustrated about illegal immigration. Just like in California, Governor Kate Brown defied the President, the will of the people, and the Constitution of the United States by declaring Oregon a sanctuary state. This is untenable, folks, and we are approaching strife not seen since the Civil War in this country. In New York and California, Democratic governors have further defied the rule of law, granting pardons to illegals because of their unlawful status in the country. These acts of executive order virtue signaling will not succeed, since ICE is still scooping up illegals and deporting them. Any kind of amnesty hand out from Washington, however, will only embolden blue state governor\u2019s adult-child social justice warrior micromanaging.\nEvery state has become a border state. The slow erosion of the nation\u2019s sovereignty is killing us all, literally. Every time there is talk in Washington D.C. about granting legal status to illegal aliens, more illegals crowd our borders. More rapists, murderers, drug dealers crowd the border and surround our cities and towns. How many more friends, relatives, and fellow Americans will have to die?\nNo, Mr. President, a DACA \u201cfix\u201d will not be a fix, Mr. President. It will only affix the Democratic Party\u2019s communistic agenda as a constant in this country. At least 50% of DACA recipients obtained permits through fraudulent means. There are at least 11 to 16 million illegals more in the country. There is nothing to prevent illegal aliens, once they achieve legal status, from bringing in five to ten more of their relatives each, many of whom are neither informed nor committed to the identity, vitality, or integrity of the United States.\nThe Republicans hold majorities in Congress and the Presidency. Why would they cave and give away their capital to renege on this precious promise of \u201cno amnesty\u201d. Sure,"}

Suddenly, it is no longer enough that Andhra Pradesh has far more news channels than any other in the country\u2014some 15, not counting impending and new entrants. What matters is whether the owner belongs to Andhra, or Rayalaseema, or Telangana and whose aspirations the media outlet is striving to represent.\nAt the end of August, Hyderabad got yet another English newspaper called Metro India. Speeches made on the occasion touched upon the most striking characteristic of the media landscape in this state. Bharatiya Janata Party leader M. Venkaiah Naidu said that if the paper wanted credibility, it should stay away from political affiliation. Chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy said he understood that the earlier newspaper from this group was begun out of compulsion, but he believed this one was being launched out of passion. The reference was to Namaste Telangana, the print mouthpiece of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), in which its leader K. Chandrasekhara Rao has a stake.\nAnd the industrialist who part-owns Namaste Telangana and is now launching Metro India, C.L. Rajam, assured his listeners that this paper would strive to remain neutral \u201cas much as possible\". Perhaps to that end, it is published by a company other than the one with a political imprint. A couple of years earlier, another Telangana industrialist started another newspaper and TV channel called The Hans India and HMTV, respectively. Those two have also sought to retain a neutral identity.\nAndhra Pradesh\u2019s media landscape has become such a chequerboard of affiliations that the politically aligned mediascape in neighbouring Tamil Nadu pales in comparison. With the impending division of the state any discussion on the media\u2019s role has journalists in the state taking you through a newspaper- and channel-listing of who supports which regional formation. Match that with each channel or newspaper\u2019s caste and political affiliation and you get a clear picture of the political economy of the media. There is the Kamma media which supports the Telugu Desam Party and a united Andhra Pradesh; Reddy media which supports the Congress and YSR Congress and the continuance of a united Andhra Pradesh; and Velama media, which includes one group that is from Andhra and pro-Andhra and another that is from Telangana and neutral.\nA number of media outlets have political owners, at least in part. Even the franchise for a channel like Zee 24 Ghantalu belongs to a Congress politician. A TV channel begun earlier this year, Channel 10, has a huge public shareholding, believed to have been organized by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Other media outlets are owned by scheduled caste leaders affiliated to both the Telugu Desam and the TRS. Even village folk are befuddled by these affiliations: a carpenter in a village in Adilabad district told me plaintively, \u201cOverall we do not know what to believe because each person gives their own news.\"\nEven if you once grew up in this state and have been visiting it since, nothing prepares you for the way identities have suddenly sharpened.

{"idx": "10713", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In the early nineteen-fifties, the United States government embarked on a top-secret endeavor to build a network of nuclear-missile launch stations beneath Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The initiative, known as Project Iceworm, faced a long list of challenges, chief among them a lack of essential knowledge about the deep structure of glaciers. At the time, sophisticated techniques for efficiently tunnelling through the cryosphere\u2014the frozen parts of Earth\u2019s surface\u2014did not exist. A team of scientists and engineers set about tackling the problem, removing long cylinders of ice, known as ice cores, from the sheet for study. The cores, they found, were made up of layers, each one formed in a single winter, rather like the concentric rings of a tree. Trapped within the layers were bubbles of gas, such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nEventually, researchers realized that these pockets of ancient air offered a chronological record of atmospheric conditions stretching back hundreds of thousands of years. Though Project Iceworm was eventually scuttled, the funding it had provided made American scientists some of the world\u2019s earliest experts at boring holes in polar glaciers. As the historian D. Graham Burnett observed, in an article for Cabinet magazine, in 2015, ice-core science \u201cnursed at the warm and flowing teat of the Cold War military-industrial complex.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s collection of columnar frozen water, gathered over the past six decades, is now stored at the National Ice Core Laboratory, near Denver. It is the biggest such repository in the world.\nWhen the artist Peggy Weil first learned about the National Ice Core Laboratory, a few years ago, she was captivated. She contacted Geoffrey Hargreaves, the lab\u2019s curator, and soon found herself inside a giant freezer, bundled in an Arctic-ready parka. (The temperature was minus thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit.) With the help of lab assistants, she loaded up a cart with cannisters made of thick cardboard, each containing a small segment of a two-mile-long core from the Greenland ice sheet. Weil trundled her specimens to a cylindrical scanner and photographed them in high resolution. Eventually, she strung together eighty-eight scans, top to bottom. Then she animated them and added an accompanying score, creating a four-and-a-half-hour video, designed to be projected onto a wall.\nWhen Weil first conceived of the project, she planned to make a video that showed all of the core\u2019s more than three thousand segments. It would have lasted seven days. Instead, she decided to pick a series of representative segments, starting at the top of the core, with the youngest ice, and ending at the bottom, more than three thousand metres down. The teams of scientists who drilled the core, from 1988 to 1993, painstakingly counted the layers as they hauled the segments up. The deepest ice, their tally showed, froze a hundred and ten thousand years ago.\nWeil\u2019s video installation is the highlight of \u201cIn Human Time,\u201d the first exhibition to be mounted by the New York Climate Museum. Conceived by the former social-justice lawyer Miranda Massie, the museum has yet to establish a permanent, physical home.

I don't think the eye-lid provides alot of padding. Just messing with ya.\nIt is probably more of a reflex than anything. Eventually it will go away. I used to be a catcher when I played baseball back in my teens and taking a lot of foul tips to my catcher's mask pretty much killed those eye-closing reflexes.\nHell, you can get a cheap/used catcher's mask and have someone lightly toss tennis balls off it while you wear it. Eventually you'll be able to keep yourself from blinking. Getting rid of a natural reflex takes time but you'll get it eventually.\nOne way my instructor told me to train the blinking out is to splash water in my face without blinking.\nYou should get used to it by sparring more. But there things you can do to help. You can get somebody to throw punches at you with little contact and try not to blink. I found the double end bag helps as well.\ntruth. and if you lose your vision, so be it. hell, van dam won bloodsport and he couldnt see shiet.\nhow long did it take most people to quit blinking/flinching? I've been consistently sparring for about 3 months like the TS, and although not as bad as the beginning, I do still blink when a combo is coming; either that or I will look towards their stomach region. Can't wait to completely break the habit.\nHaving strong neck means your head doesn't get snapped back, which is HUGE, I repeat HUGE in striking. The neck is everything.\nAfter 12 years I still catch myself wincing/blinking from time to time. It takes a concious thought for me to stop. sometimes I just bury my chin and take a few to the forehead other times once I realize I'm doing it I stop. Sometimes I go several rounds and can't stop.\nA simple solution there may not be one for all people. Getting hit hurts and its a natrual reaction to blink when stuff is flying towards your eyes thats what eye lids do. A antherh method if you don't like taking shots to the forehead is take a few off your gloves right in front of your face and focus on the problem.\nI think more rounds will most likely help but so will a concious effort to stop once you start. Some people will do it for as long as they lt people try to hit them in the face.\nI've taken some pretty big shots to the forehead (right on the hardest part) they just seem to land there when I have chin tucked and they can't get through my guard to my chin. I've taken a BIG overhand left from my southpaw sparring partner, and it just hasn't even really phased me, it's a big hit, but it just feels like no damage is done.\nYou need to think long term.

When deciding where to have a surgical procedure, it is important to understand the differences between each one.\nOf utmost importance is certification and accreditation of the facility, and the experience and track records of the surgeons and staff. The Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) is responsible for certification and accreditation of ASCs and physician office-based surgery centers. Hospital Outpatient Department surgery centers can seek accreditation from any Medicare-approved accreditation program. DNV-GL, part of the Det Norske Veritas group, is the accrediting agency for Lee Health.\nThe recent news series pointed out that unlike hospital-based surgery centers, ambulatory and physician office surgery centers are not required to report to government regulators all patient transfers to hospitals or fatalities. Physician office-based surgery centers have fewer regulations. Although regulation does not guarantee safer or better outcomes, it does set minimum standards and reporting requirements to help reduce variation in practice and improve adoption of best clinical practices. We believe transparency is necessary to help the public make informed decisions about their care.\n\u2022 We report any transfers on a monthly basis, and file an event report to patient safety organizations and state.\n\u2022 As part of the hospital, we are surveyed and accredited by DNV-GL, a Medicare-approved accrediting organization.\n\u2022 Staffing ratios are the same as the hospital.\n\u2022 Nursing staff is required to have a minimum of three years of experience so they are prepared to respond to emergencies.\n\u2022 Staff participates in all education, training and leadership initiatives as part of the Lee Health system.\n\u2022 To assure all patients are healthy enough to have their procedure done at the Outpatient Surgery Center, each is assessed by our Pre-Procedure Testing department. Every chart is reviewed by the medical director to determine appropriate pre-procedure testing: i.e., EKG, labs.\n\u2022 We provide comprehensive patient education before, during and after the surgery to ensure the patient fully understands how to participate in their care and recover as quickly as possible. All surgical team staff members have Basic Life Support certification, and staff in some units has certification in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support.\n\u2022 The Outpatient Surgery Center participates in fire drills, as well as medical response drills, biohazard training, medication safety, airway management, etc. and all required Lee Health system training to be fully prepared should an emergency occur.\nPatient safety and quality care are top priorities in all Lee Health facilities.

He had quit soon after discovering that George W. Bush\u2019s administration had turned the system on the American public, just as Church had cautioned might happen. \u201cThey violated the Constitution setting it up,\u201d Binney told me. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t care. They were going to do it anyway, and they were going to crucify anyone who stood in the way.\u201d He held his thumb and forefinger close together. \u201cWe are, like, that far from a turnkey totalitarian state,\u201d Binney said.\nIs Trump about to start the ignition? The public doesn\u2019t yet know all the details of his plans for the NSA and other intelligence agencies. It probably never will, given the clandestine nature of surveillance. Yet the signals to date are disturbing.\nTrump has presented distressing views on spying that would target specific communities and individuals. \u201cI want surveillance of certain mosques,\u201d he told a rally in November 2015. He has called the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201cthreat\u201d that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, we\u2019re going to have to be watching.\u201d Also troubling are the repercussions that Trump\u2019s opponents might face. Infamously, Trump said on Fox and Friends in 2013 that Snowden is \u201ca terrible traitor\u201d and, \u201cYou know, spies in the old days used to be executed.\u201d Trump\u2019s CIA pick favors exactly that course of action. \u201cI think the proper outcome would be that [Snowden] would be given a death sentence,\u201d Pompeo said on C-SPAN last February.\nThen there is Presidential Policy Directive 28. Issued by Barack Obama in 2014 following the Snowden revelations, PPD-28 established guidelines for the NSA\u2019s international spying. Surveillance can\u2019t be used, for instance, to give U.S. companies a competitive edge or to quell dissent abroad. Trump could rescind that directive and issue another one that might provide him with intelligence on rival companies to his business empire or on foreign groups opposed to his policies.\nAs proof that his administration should be granted more spying power, he might also point to a sweeping surveillance bill passed in the United Kingdom in late November.

And now, HBO has released the first footage from the upcoming movie which premieres on Saturday, October 20th. Peter Dinklage plays Herve Villechaize, who was once known as the most famous dwarf in the world. Villechaize was a French actor who starred in Fantasy Island as Tattoo and in The Man With the Golden Gun as Nick Nack.\nMy Dinner with Herve takes place over one night in Los Angeles when Peter Dinklage's Herv\u00e9 Villechaize is interviewed by struggling journalist Danny Tate, who is played in the film by Jamie Dornan. The movie is based off of an interview that director Sacha Gervasi conducted with Villechaize, which was the last interview that the late actor agreed to. Villechaize committed suicide shortly after his interview with Gervasi in 1993 and many believe that the interview was a suicide note from Villechaize.\nSacha Gervasi has gone to great lengths over the years to declare that Herve Villechaize was much more than a pop culture icon from the 1970s and 80s. The director has said that Villechaize was \"one of the most charming, cultured, and dangerous people I've ever met.\" My Dinner with Herve is going to explore the depths of the man behind Tattoo and Nick Nack and try to put forth who he was in real-life. Peter Dinklage doesn't exactly look anything like Villechaize, but he has the acting chops to bring forth an excellent tribute to the late actor, which is evident in the 30-second teaser that HBO has just released.\nIn addition to Peter Dinklage and Jamie Dornan, My Dinner with Herve also stars Mireille Enos as Herve's longtime girlfriend, Kathy Self, Harriet Walter, Fiona Baskin, Oona Chaplin, Katie Nielson, David Strathairn, Marty Rothstein, and Andy Garcia as Ricardo Montalban, Villechaize's Fantasy Island co-star. In addition to directing the film, Sacha Gervasi also co-wrote the screenplay with Sean Macaulay. Dinklage also serves as a producer on the project along with Gervasi and Garrett Basch and David Ginsberg.\nAs previously noted, My Dinner with Herve has been in development for years. HBO is preparing to debut the movie on October 20th, so fans will finally get to see what Peter Dinklage and Sacha Gervasi have been working on for so long. The teaser video for the film packs a lot into 30 seconds and teases Herve Villechaize's \"real story,\" through clips of the actor on Fantasy Island and The Man With the Golden Gun, as Villechaize is at the top of his game and then at the end of his life as he sits down for his interview with Danny Tate. You can watch the first footage for My Dinner with Herve below, thanks to the HBO YouTube channel."}

That McCain resisted an opportunity to turn our fear against each other then, when the stakes were so high, is remarkable. It\u2019s even more remarkable now.\nIt feels as though there is much to fear these days. Though we are more prosperous a nation and more connected a global community than ever before, many of us still feel lonely, disoriented and uncertain of the future.\nThe reckless, feckless and corrupt character of our current political leadership has something to do with that, perhaps. But there\u2019s also been tectonic shifts in the way we interact due less to politics and more to technology that have upended the way we treat each other.\nThat McCain left us with words that are meant to relieve our anxieties and dissolve our fears instead of stoke them tells you everything you need to know about the man.\nI\u2019m grateful for McCain for so many things. As an American, I\u2019m grateful for his service. As a conservative, I\u2019m grateful for his commitment to principle.

Robert Grenier, the CIA's former counterterrorism chief, has called Mousaoui's allegations \"inconceivable,\" and a former top Navy terrorism investigator, Robert McFadden, compared the claims to \"a unicorn,\" the Guardian reported.\nThough Moussaou was diagnosed as mentally ill by a court psychologist, he was deemed competent to stand trial on terrorism charges and was described by the Times as seeming \"calm and largely coherent\" throughout his 100-page testimony.\nSaudi King Salman, who took over after King Abdullah's death in January.\n\"Moussaoui describes meeting in Saudi Arabia with Salman, then the crown prince, and other Saudi royals while delivering them letters from Osama bin Laden,\" according to the Times.\nWhether or not Saudi Arabia was involved in planning and financing the 9/11 attacks has long been a subject of dispute.

{"idx": "10731", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: painful, it is not considered merciful to prescribe an overdose to a cancer victim against her will, or to gently smother a sleeping Alzheimer\u2019s patient.\nThe difference, of course, is that Kevorkian\u2019s clients asked for it. That free choice is what separates assisted suicide from murder, his defenders would insist.\nWhat peculiar wording. Douthat makes it sound as if this defense of Kevorkian is some kind of transparently concocted subterfuge. But, yes, the fact that his clients asked for it is what makes assisted suicide different from murder. Even if you don\u2019t approve, this is a pretty natural distinction and an easy one to grasp.\nSo what\u2019s the objection to assisted suicide? This is where it gets weird. Douthat argues that it\u2019s a slippery slope: if terminally ill patients are allowed to kill themselves, what\u2019s to stop anyone else who wants to do it? Nothing, he says, as the example of Dignitas, a Swiss assisted suicide clinic, shows. And technically that\u2019s true: about a fifth of Dignitas\u2019s clients aren\u2019t terminally ill, but merely weary of life. But think about that number: it means that perhaps 200 weary people have used Dignitas\u2019s services over the past decade or so. That\u2019s something like 20 per year.\nIn other words, even after a decade in business, Dignitas almost certainly isn\u2019t doing anything to spur suicides and it hasn\u2019t created a tidal wave of people wanting to die. Like so many other things, it merely provides an additional option for the well off (Dignitas charges about $6,000 to perform an assisted suicide). The less well off simply continue to swallow bottles of aspirin or jump off bridges.\nSo, again: what\u2019s the problem?1 More than anything else, I think this column illustrates the perils of taking a religiously motivated belief and trying to justify it on secular grounds. It just doesn\u2019t work. The slippery slope here pretty obviously doesn\u2019t amount to much, so you\u2019re left with a simple disapproval of people deciding to take their own lives. And what\u2019s the argument for that? Douthat doesn\u2019t provide one. He simply declares it murder and calls it a day. Without recourse to his underlying religious objections, that\u2019s really his only choice.\nBut of course, that\u2019s the real slippery slope. If the state is allowed to prohibit me from killing myself, what else is the state allowed to do? Can it force me to accept medical treatment that will save my life? Can it force me to accept medical treatment that might save my life? If not, why?\nI\u2019m a liberal, but I\u2019d just as soon keep the state out of decisions like that. I\u2019d especially like to keep the state out if there\u2019s no compelling secular reason for them to get involved. In this case, there sure doesn\u2019t appear to be.\n1Needless to say, there are practical issues with assisted suicide. You need to make sure the client really wants to die and isn\u2019t just reacting to a momentary bout of depression. You need to make sure there\u2019s no coercion. You need to make sure the client is of sound mind. But I think all of these things are pretty widely accepted as simple common sense."}

When he gets going, he is one the best scorers in college basketball but he tends to disappear too frequently.\nJames McAdoo, F, North Carolina, Fr.\nUNC coaches want to see more aggressiveness out of McAdoo and the freshman showed some glimpse of his ability but still does not seem completely comfortable at this point of his career.

Therefore, growth in demand should remain healthy. Globally, the greatest proportion of demand is for application in magnets; though in the United States the majority of demand is in catalysts for petroleum refining, chemical processing, and catalytic converters.\nThe United States re-entered REE production in 2012 when Molycorp (NYSE: MCP) restarted mining operations at Mountain Pass, California, after a 10-year hiatus.

{"idx": "10744", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Even as the national debate rages around federal funding of the arts, local organizations find support from cities.\nThe topic of government support of the arts is often controversial.\nVarious sides of the debate have again been argued in recent weeks at the federal level. The Trump administration has proposed drastic cuts to various arts-related programs, including a complete elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts.\nYet there is a long history of governmental patronage of the arts. Gudea, a ruler in Mesopotamia from about 2144-2124 BC, is among the early examples of kingly patronage of the arts. The federal government of the United States first began supporting the arts in 1817 when the 14th Congress commissioned a series of paintings to hang in the Capitol Rotunda.\nThroughout the 20th century, presidents from both sides of the political divide encouraged federal support of the arts. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a democrat, created programs like the Federal Art Project and the Federal Music Project as part of the New Deal, while President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a republican, recommended the creation of a federal agency to advise the government on the arts.\n\u201cThe federal government should do more to give official recognition to the importance of the arts and other cultural activities,\u201d Eisenhower said during one of his State of the Union addresses.\nMost artists and arts organizations in our region will never be the recipients of federal dollars through the NEA or other programs, but many regional arts organizations do receive significant support from local municipalities.\n\u201cOne of the largest patrons of the arts here in St. George is the city,\u201d said Gary Sanders, community arts administrator for the city of St. George.\nArtist Darrell Driver paints in front of his retail booth at the 2015 St. George Art Festival. The festival brings in artists and visitors from throughout the West.\nBy way of example, Sanders pointed to city facilities such as the St. George Art Museum, the St. George Opera House and the Electric Theater as well as events like the concerts in the park and the upcoming St. George Art Festival on Easter weekend.\nWhile some residents might oppose governmental support of these arts facilities and events, Sanders said the city\u2019s patronage is necessary.\nA major issue in Southern Utah is the lack of \u201cold-money\u201d philanthropic groups that are often the benefactors of the arts in more populated areas. Many individual residents donate to local arts groups, but these relatively small donations are often not sufficient to support the groups and their events.\nIn Cedar City, the Utah Shakespeare Festival has been able to access some major philanthropic institutions from Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, but the festival has decades of experience in fundraising and a Tony Award for clout.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have these old foundations \u2026 yet,\u201d Sanders said.\nThe Utah Shakespeare Festival's production of \"Henry V\" features some epic battle scenes.\nIn examining the role of local governments in the arts, we spoke with elected officials and representatives of arts organizations in Cedar City, Mesquite and St. George. All municipalities have different approaches to how they support the arts, but each of these cities offers either funding or infrastructure that benefits local arts organizations.\nCedar City is known as Utah\u2019s Festival City, and its flagship event is the Utah Shakespeare Festival.

Alessandro Beber of the University of Amsterdam and Marco Pagano of the University of Naples Federico II have now carried out a study of the bans and regulatory constraints on short-selling during the recent financial crisis, by examining data for around 17,000 stocks from 30 countries. They compared the prices of stocks for which short-sales were restricted (financial stocks in some countries) with stocks that didn\u2019t have these restrictions. They also estimated the impact of the ban by comparing stocks where short-selling was banned with similar stocks in countries where there was no ban.\nSeveral months after the ban on short-sales had been imposed, in a telephone interview to Reuters, Christopher Cox, the former chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission who had banned short-selling of stocks for a few weeks, had the grace to say, \u201cKnowing what we know now, I believe on balance the commission would not do it again.

The authors provide a long list of benefits: \u201cSchooling also encourages patience and long-term thinking. Teen fertility, criminal activity, and other risky behaviour decrease with it. Schooling promotes trust and civic participation. It teaches students how to enjoy a good book and manage money.\"\nPerhaps all this is true in the US. But in India, where a PhD or a postgraduate study course is often taken up by people unable to get a better job, the link between good jobs and schooling may be tenuous. Why else do thousands of people with post-graduate degrees apply for menial jobs in Indian Railways?

Although it will support both types of network, users will have to wait for other bits of the jigsaw puzzle to be put into place before they can seamlessly roam between the networks.\nThe card, dubbed the GC79, is an update of the existing GC75, which only offers GSM and GPRS connectivity. With the GC79, Sony Ericsson has removed the external antenna. It will support all three GSM bands, for worldwide connectivity, as well as GPRS class 10 and 802.11 Wi-Fi, which provides 11Mbps when in range of a Wi-Fi hot spot. The price, said Sony Ericsson business manager Johan Tysklind, is likely to be about 25 percent higher than for the GC75. Different deals with different network operators make it difficult to name the price, said Tysklind, but estimates hover around 350 euros.\nThe GC79 will support a relatively new protocol, called Extensible Authentication Protocol, that will let GSM operators bill for Wi-Fi airtime over the GSM network, said Tysklind. EAP SIM, as it is known, should be ratified as a standard this June. Currently, customers of Wi-Fi hot spot operators have to sign up separately and be given a password to use the bandwidth, even when the Wi-Fi service provider is BT. With EAP SIM-enabled devices running on EAP SIM compliant networks, operators will be able to bill for Wi-Fi use through the user's mobile phone bill.\nHowever, the real benefit for many users will be an automatic handover from the GSM network to 801.11b and back, depending on whether they want the cheapest or the fastest available option. \"This is not a feature of the card, it's a feature of the software,\" said Tysklind. \"At the moment there are some proprietary applications that enable roaming between GSM and Wi-Fi, but by next year you should see the client software built into Microsoft Windows. That will make roaming much more seemless.\"\nSome trials of GSM/Wi-Fi roaming have already been conducted. Swiss company Togewanet is currently conducting field trials with Swisscom Mobile for its WeRoam services, which lets wireless ISPs connect to the networks of mobile operators and vice versa, so that a common roaming platform can be created.\nFor a map of the UK's commercial Wi-Fi hot spots, click here."}

When one removes his carefully crafted doublespeak about tolerance and diversity, a disturbing portrait of the Oxford professor emerges: Ramadan finds nothing to reject in al-Banna's supremacist ideas; he has been accused of links to terrorists; he has justified bombings in Israel, Russia, and Iraq as legitimate resistance; he went no further than calling for a \"moratorium\" against stoning while the practice is debated; he supports restrictions on the public lives of women; he demands that integration take place on Muslims' terms; he led a boycott against the 2008 Turin Book Fair because it honored Israel; and on and on.

In 2009, Mogahed was a guest on Muslimah Dilemma, a show on the UK's extremist-heavy Islam Channel. Interviewed by a Hizb-ut-Tahrir member, Mogahed stated that \"the majority of women around the world associate gender justice, or justice for women, with Shari'a compliance.\" Moreover, she offered no defense of liberal democracy when it came under attack.\nJoan Wallach Scott, a leftist professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, completes the panel. In her former position as chair of the academic freedom committee of the American Association of University Professors, she protested the firing of jihadist operative Sami al-Arian and dismissed critics of Middle East studies as a \"well-organized,\" \"pro-occupation lobby.\" Scott also compared David Horowitz's anti-indoctrination campaign to the work of Nazis, while laughably asserting that \"there is no lack of balance in the academy as a whole.\"\nShe probably sees \"no lack of balance\" on the Cooper Union panel either.

If you are willing to lose a house you want, just follow these eight easy steps.\n1. Submit an offer at 77 percent of asking for a well-priced house that's been on the market for only seven days. Make sure to do this verbally so that the seller knows absolutely nothing about you.\n2. After having this offer rejected, agonize for three more days before submitting a new offer -- this time at 84 percent of asking price.\n3. After having this offer rejected, wait another few days. Then, compose a long email to your buyer agent detailing why the house is not worth a penny more than the 84 percent of list price that you just offered. Be as critical of the property as possible, and be sure to include a price-per-square-foot comparison versus a recently-sold house in the neighborhood that you've never seen.\nAsk your agent to forward this email to the listing agent so that the sellers can better understand where you're coming from.\n4. Wait another few days so that the sellers think they are finally rid of you. Then, submit the offer you should have brought in the first place, at 91 percent of asking. Be sure to direct your buyer agent to mention how reluctant you are to pay this much, and how fortunate the sellers are to have a buyer as qualified as yourself interested in their home.\n5. Counter in $10,000 increments in response to seller counters of $25,000. Whine a lot so the seller understands you are doing this against your will.\n6. Dig in your heels when you are $25,000 apart in the negotiations. Ask for a detailed utility cost history that makes the seller wonder if you can actually afford the monthly payments once you own the house.\n7.

Bottom line, behave in a way that makes the process so unpleasant for the sellers that if another offer comes in, they will prefer it to anything you may come back with.\nThe moral of this story is never to lowball a house that you love.

I refer to the treatment of Persons of Indian Origin who carry passports issued by other countries. By doing this, they lose the opportunity to hold Indian passports.\nThink how unfair this is. I may look Indian and have been born in India, as immersed in Bollywood as kids in Mumbai, rooting for the Indian cricket team as much as anybody else. But if i happen to hold the citizenship of another country, i cannot carry an Indian passport. Instead, the best i can have is an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card which allows me to travel to India, and live and work there, but denies me: 1) the right to vote; 2) the right to hold elective public office; 3) the right to compete for government jobs; and 4) the right to buy agricultural property.\nI know what you are thinking \u2013 \u201cBe grateful we have given you even this much. After all, you left us!\u201d To which my response is, \u201cWhat about Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d? If there is any philosophical or moral merit to this idea, then surely no Indian who ever left the shores of India ceases to be a member of the Indian family. Then why treat us differently?\nTo which you might say \u2013 every other country does the same thing. But you would be wrong \u2013 at least 50 countries, including major ones like the US, UK, Canada and Australia, allow dual or even multiple citizenships.\nBut how would you know that we would be loyal to India? This is an unfair knee-jerk question. A little reflection will show that resident Indians are not required to prove their loyalty, so why should overseas Indians be held to a different standard? Consider the millions of resident Indians who show active \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to India on a daily basis \u2013 through their corruption, tax evasion, fraud, subversion of institutions, incitement to communal violence, terrorism, etc. You do not take away their citizenship for any of these reasons.\nMoreover, overseas Indians have proved their loyalty time and time again \u2013 most spectacularly in 1999 during the Kargil War when NRIs were critical in influencing and shaping public opinion in the US all the way to the US Congress and President Bill Clinton, who just a year earlier had castigated and sanctioned India for its nuclear tests. But he shifted gears dramatically and forced Pakistan to withdraw in humiliation. US-based NRIs also made a valuable contribution in guiding the US towards accepting India in the nuclear club.\nPermitting dual citizenship will get India incremental, high quality civic engagement in local, state and national issues. The grant of full political rights will see more Indians abroad choosing to get involved in the political processes of India, instead of being mere bystanders. OCIs will bring, based on their observations and experiences, new, creative and innovative approaches and skills to think about and solve problems.\nHaving experienced and helped build successful public institutions, these overseas Indians understand good citizenship, and demand and expect quality in all aspects of public life. They will bring new and better ideas for governance to improve delivery of public services and reduce corruption. And they will bring all the passion and energy that has allowed them to be successful overseas. How can all this be bad for India?\nAnd then there is money. Overseas Indians remit an average of $70"}

Brady focuses on himself, presenting a sunny but vague picture of what he would do as governor.\nIn stark terms, the ad tries to do two things: tie Brady to gun violence and plant the idea that Brady is a potentially risky unknown.\nThe ad opens with images of a gun. \u201cThis is a deadly semi-automatic assault weapon. It\u2019s not used to hunt ducks or deer. It\u2019s used to hunt people \u2014 and kill them,\u201d the narrator says as the chalk outline of a body appears.\nThe ad correctly points out that Brady opposes reinstating a ban on assault weapons.\nIt goes on to say Brady opposes restrictions on guns near schools.\nThe ad cites two pieces of legislation, one in 1993 allowing an immediate one-year suspension for students who bring a gun to school and another in 1997 stiffening penalties for bring an illegal gun within 1,000 feet of a school. Records show Brady voted against both measures.\nQuinn may hope that Brady, a veteran Bloomington legislator, is a blank to many voters. If he can fill that blank spot with negatives \u2014 in this case, guns and violence \u2014 Quinn stands a better chance of keeping independents and disgruntled Democrats from swinging to the Republican candidate.\nThe Quinn campaign said the ad will run only in the Chicago area.\nIt could hurt him if downstate voters see it. Assault weapons are less of a concern outside the Chicago area, and downstate voters tend to resent weapons restrictions.\nBrady accused Quinn of distorting his record. Aides say he might have voted against these particular bills, but he also supported others that restricted guns around schools.\n\u201cI\u2019m not for guns in schools and he knows that,\u201d Brady said, adding that the gun shown in the ad is already illegal in Illinois.\nBrady\u2019s ad is a positive recap of his views, with no policy specifics. He promises to \u201cstop the insane borrowing,\u201d balance the budget without raising taxes, stand up to special interests and create jobs.\n\u201cThese are difficult times, but we can have a brighter tomorrow,\u201d Brady says.\nThe ad presents a kaleidoscope of pretty images: the Illinois State Fair, Brady on a farm, sunlight through the trees, Brady overlooking Chicago. It manages to squeeze 24 images into just 30 seconds.\nIn effect, Brady is answering the question of \u201cwho is this guy?\u201d with pictures and promises that are as upbeat as Quinn\u2019s ad is downbeat.\nBut the ad doesn\u2019t answer the many questions that Brady\u2019s promises raise.\nFor instance, despite his promise to balance the budget, Brady has acknowledged he lacks a specific plan for closing the state\u2019s record-high $13 billion deficit. He promises to cut spending 10 percent, but says he won\u2019t provide details until after taking office.\nBrady is spending about $250,000 to run his ad statewide, while Quinn\u2019s Chicago-only spot will cost about $500,000, said people familiar with the ads.\nAssociated Press Writer Deanna Bellandi contributed to this report from Zion, Ill."}

Thanks to the support of NEH, the Kansas Humanities Council is preserving personal artifacts of veterans; the Missouri Humanities Council has supported production of anthologies of writing by veterans; Humanities Iowa has supported an oral history project for returning warriors; and the Oklahoma Humanities Council is producing a documentary about the experiences of Native Americans in the armed services.\nBy affirming our shared past, and stretching to spread connected conversations throughout all of America's 21st-century communities, the National Endowment for the Humanities provides an unparalleled public service.\nPerhaps we are so divided, Mr. President -- a state of affairs that, as you acknowledged, preceded even the election of Barack Obama -- precisely because we have so profoundly reduced our investment in connective tissue such as the NEH.

The planet, which was discovered in 2007, is about eight times more massive than Jupiter.\nHAT-P-2b's path is much more elliptical than the orbits of the eight officially recognized planets in our solar system, so it makes one close approach to the star every 5.6 Earth days. During each of these \"flybys,\" the alien planet's powerful gravity pulls hard on the star, causing its outer shell to vibrate, the researchers found.\nSuch interactions have been observed before, in binary \"heartbeat stars.\" But the new study, which was published today (Feb. 14) in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, marks the first time a planet has been implicated in the phenomenon, study team members said.\n\"It's remarkable that this relatively small planet seems to affect the whole star in a way that we can see from far away,\" study co-author Heather Knutson, an assistant professor of geological and planetary sciences at the California Institute of Technology, said in the same statement.\nHAT-P-2b is about 100 times less massive than its host star, the researchers said. For comparison, Jupiter is about 1,000 times less massive than the sun.\nThe researchers spotted the pulsations after analyzing 350 hours of Spitzer observations, which were made between July 2011 and November 2015. The find came as a surprise.\n\"We had intended the observations to provide a detailed look at HAT-P-2b's atmospheric circulation,\" said study co-author Nikole Lewis, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"The discovery of the oscillations was unexpected but adds another piece to the puzzle of how this system evolved.\"\nThe heartbeat effect is slight; the star's oscillations are the most subtle light variations that the Spitzer Space Telescope has ever measured from any source, the researchers said. But modeling work indicates that the pulsations should be ever fainter, so there are more mysteries for the team to investigate.\n\"Our observations suggest that our understanding of planet-star interactions is incomplete,\" de Wit said. \"There's more to learn from studying stars in systems like this one and listening for the stories they tell through their 'heartbeats.'\""}

{"idx": "10779", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The last old-school record company in Memphis plugs away in a lair below Hollywood Street near Sam Cooper Boulevard, unbeknownst to most of the city. Ecko Records was launched in 1995 to release a salty song by a once-popular local artist when no established label would take the chance. Ollie Nightingale's \"I'll Drink Your Bath Water, Baby\" sold enough to make founder John Ward think he could make a living in an unforgiving business and set the artistic tone for the upstart company.\nThirteen years later, the company represents the last gasp of Southern soul in Memphis. Ecko's artistic roots intertwine with the genre's most celebrated record labels, and its business practices echo this bygone era.\nEcko functions as part of the chitlin circuit, a conglomerate of African-American nightclubs, concert promoters, radio stations, and mom-and-pop record shops concentrated in the Deep South and sprinkled throughout Northeastern and Midwestern cities. Circuit music, interchangeably called blues, Southern soul, soul blues, and even grown folks' music, appeals mostly to black listeners over age 35, a loyal good-time group that packs festivals and juke joints to hear the artists who've been circulating for decades.\nThe most popular circuit attractions, including Marvin Sease, Mel Waiters, Bobby Rush, Shirley Brown, and Denise LaSalle, are black singers, also well over 35. Their subject matter, best exemplified in song titles such as LaSalle's \"Pay Before You Pump,\" Sease's \"Candy Licker,\" and Waiters' \"Hole in the Wall,\" reflect the humor, taboos, and lives of grown folks, pretty well disqualifying the music from crossing over to a wider (and whiter) audience.\nThough the chitlin circuit operates outside the mainstream music business, Ecko is not immune to the convulsive changes gripping the industry at large. Death has claimed several Ecko artists \u2014 first Nightingale in 1997, then Quinn Golden in 2003, and Bill Coday earlier this year \u2014 while CD piracy slices Ecko's sales and corporations gobble up the small local radio stations through which the lifeblood of Southern soul flowed. Ecko survives thanks to its time-honored approach to making music in Memphis.\n\"It's tradition-based music, blues, played in a contemporary way,\" Ward explains. \"A song like 'Green Onions' ... it sounds contemporary, just as good today as it did whenever they put it out. You don't just hear it and say, '1962, I remember them days.' As opposed to Motown music, which is pop-based and sounds like oldies now. Stax stuck pretty close to the roots. I feel like what we do is that type of music ... same influences in blues.\"\nStill, Ward insists, Ecko is no reverberation of the classic Memphis sound. \"We're not trying to recreate what anybody did at Stax. It ain't got anything to do with that \u2014 it's totally contemporary. I can play you a song that we did 10 years ago, and you can't tell me that we didn't just do it yesterday.\"\nThere's something poetic about Ecko's studio. For starters, the company makes music for an underground music scene from a subterranean location. Ecko and its fans"}

{"idx": "10781", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Last Tuesday, a farm-to-table subscription service called Local Roots NYC dropped off boxes at pickup spots in New York City including a cafe, a brew pub and the offices of BuzzFeed.\nAlongside locally grown rainbow chard, romaine lettuce and beets, some members got bottles of olive oil from Italy or bars of chocolate and bags of dried pasta, both Brooklyn-made. From Rustic Roots, an organic-food delivery service in the tristate area, members could receive fruit boxes stacked with oranges, pineapples and avocados.\nAlthough both companies use the term \u201cC.S.A.,\u201d community-supported agriculture, to describe their service, the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional C.S.A.s are designed to avoid. And since olives and oranges do not grow in this region, those products provide no direct income to local farmers, precisely the people the C.S.A. was invented to benefit.\nCommunity-supported agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers. Starting in the 1980s (earlier in Europe and Japan), members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce.\nIt was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer. It did not rely on distributors or brick-and-mortar stores, and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash for the winter, used to buy seeds, repair equipment and expand into new growing methods.\nThe goal was for C.S.A. farmers and members to build a mutually supportive long-term relationship. Members would get straight-from-the-farm produce from a farmer they knew and trusted, and farmers would get financial stability.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other customer that pays you 100 percent, in advance, year after year,\u201d said Maggie Wood, an owner of Golden Earthworm Farm on the North Fork of Long Island.

Now, online hubs are using sophisticated distribution technology to snap into the food chain, often using \u201cC.S.A.\u201d to describe what they deliver.\nThe term is not regulated in most states, so companies can define it as they wish. Peapod, the online shopping service owned by the international grocery giant Ahold, delivers farm-sourced boxes throughout the Northeast; FreshDirect offers a variety of C.S.A. options in and around New York City.\nAs the \u201cfarm share\u201d concept has spread, the C.S.A. has become just another part of the sprawling, messy modern system of knowing where your food comes from and choosing what you want to eat.\nThe opportunity for confusion is of enormous concern to many farmers in the New York region. Depending on how and where these new businesses buy their produce, consumers can receive all the benefits of C.S.A. membership, while the farmers get only a fraction.

A lot of people believe, as you do, that gun violence has gotten out of control and our schools are unsafe.\nControl guns, or not? Each side holds powerful arguments.\n\u201cEach person in the State of Nevada having control or charge of any child between the ages of 7 and 18 shall send the child to a public school during all the time the public school is in session in the school district.\u201d This law was put in place because schools don\u2019t have the resources to monitor student safety off-campus.\nThe consequence of walking out of class without a permission slip is you will be marked absent. However, bringing a guardian\u2019s permission slip excusing a temporary absence on March 14 will ensure you are not marked absent.\nThe local media will be out in force to document your protest and will report what you say and how you act to the Northern Nevada community. This is your chance to make your voices heard! Be articulate. Speak from the heart. Don\u2019t curse. Respect your school\u2019s teachers and leadership during the walk out.\nIn the 1960s, Cesar Chavez called for peaceful boycotts, protests and hunger strikes which led to legislation that ended exploitative abuse of America\u2019s farm workers.\nThe Suffrage Parade on March 3, 1913, in Washington, D.C. was an important moment in the struggle to grant American women the right to vote \u2014 a right that was granted in 1920.\nIf you don\u2019t join the walkout, your school will have activities that will provide meaningful engagement. For instance, student leadership clubs are organizing moments of silence. Others are preparing ribbons to tie to school fences.\nSomething all students can do is email your legislators at http://mapserve1.leg.state.nv.us/whoru.

{"idx": "10791", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Publishers identify and publish books that attract readers.\nBook publishers take responsibility for all aspects of book publication. Their aim is to attract good authors and publish books that achieve commercial success. Depending on the size of the publishing company, the book publisher may carry out all aspects of publication, or may delegate part of the work to editors, designers and marketing specialists.\nSome publishers concentrate on broad categories, such as fiction or non-fiction. Others specialize within those broad sectors, publishing non-fiction books on art, business or science, for example. The choice of subject may be based on tradition if the publishing company has a long history. Newer publishing houses base their lists on market conditions, modifying their publishing programs in line with market demand. Large publishing companies with a wide range of titles appoint a number of publishers, each with responsibility for a different category.\nBook publishers may commission books that fit the profile of the publishing company. Or, they may review book proposals from authors or their agents. In larger companies, publishers delegate the detailed review of book proposals to commissioning editors, using their reports to make final decisions on whether to publish. Publishers prepare contracts that set out the requirements for the book and the payments the author will receive.\nWhen authors have completed their manuscripts, publishers review the text to ensure that it meets the requirements set out in the contract in terms of content, quality and length. Publishers manage the manuscript editing, design and production process, using a team of editors, proofreaders, graphic designers and printers. They provide schedules for each stage of the process, working backwards from the planned publication date.\nPublishers may look for opportunities to sell copies of the book to book stores, schools and colleges, libraries, special-interest groups and book clubs. They also aim to sell overseas rights to other companies that will translate the text and publish the book in their own territories. They negotiate terms that give the publisher and author shares of the income from various groups. Typically, publishers offer authors a pre-publication advance on royalties from book sales and authors earn further royalties once sales revenue covers the advance. Sales revenue is based on the actual revenue the publisher receives, not the cover price of the book, because publishers give booksellers discounts of up to 50 percent. The income the publisher receives covers costs, including authors\u2019 royalties, production, distribution and overhead costs.\nTo build sales of the book, publishers plan and manage a promotional program. They work with marketing and design professionals to create advertisements, direct marketing campaigns and other communications material. They publish book excerpts online, arrange interviews with authors and encourage authors to write opinion pieces for publication or participate in promotional events, such as book fairs, seminars and book store signings.\nLinton, Ian. \"What Does a Book Publisher Do?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/book-publisher-do-6716.html.

Singh was Mike Shaw (Bastion Booger/Norman the Lunatic), who was an incredibly underrated worker, a very talent superheavyweight who had great matches with Owen. He would go up for all of Owen's cool suplexes, sell big for him, and just keep up with him perfectly in general. If you're doing an Owen Hart set, then this feud needs to be represented, so it's good to see this listed here.\nThis has been on a million WWE DVD sets, but it also has to be here. It's one of the very best matches of Owen's career, arguably his best WWF match, and probably his finest moment as a star. Not only is it a great technical match, but it's a masterpiece in terms of Bret laying out a match where he made sure Owen would come out of it as a heel even though he won as clean as a sheet. Probably the best pay-per-view opener in WWE history, as well.\nThis match, originally shot at a Superstars taping for the Wham Bam Bodyslam home video, is a bit of a random choice. Most likely, they wanted a Bret-Owen title match on the set, and this is the one where Owen \"wins the title\" with Jim Neidhart's help before it's overturned and the match is restarted. It's a fun moment to see him with the belt, though this is not necessarily one of their best matches together.\nAnother odd choice, but if you're going to include an Owen and Yokozuna tag title defense, it might as well be this one. Owen and Davey Boy always had great chemistry and their partners had a long-standing issue, so this is one of their better matches as a team.\nThis is the blowoff to their feud that began with the reality-inspired angle Owen gave Michaels a concussion with an enzuigiri the night after Survivor Series. It was Owen's first main event level singles program that didn't involve Bret, and he made the most of it. This is an excellent match with a hot crowd and gets the ball rolling on Michaels' amazing 1996 run of great pay-per-view matches."}

The June election marks the first reelection since Spain was under dictatorship and the southern European nation will remain under a caretaker government as political parties fail to reach a consensus. Experts warn that Spain\u2019s economic gains could be in jeopardy if the next election fails to bring a resolution.\nThe decree effectively dissolves parliament, and the king is hoping a new election would usher in stability after parties failed to reach a majority during December elections. The past four months have been contentious as politicians wrangle for power and cannot find common ground, stoking further uncertainty.\nThough Spain has made significant strides in the past few years, the economy has left many people behind, explaining the rise of anti-austerity parties like Podemos. Podemos is one among multiple parties that gained additional seats during the last election, but must share power with the mainline Socialist Party, Ciudadanos, and other parties.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy resides over the caretaker government and he is aiming for another term, but his center-right Popular Party could be at the mercy of opposing parties if opposition leaders come to an agreement in the future.\nAlthough the drama is not affecting Spain in the short-term, experts fear that the uncertainty could result in trepidation from the business community. Spain is expected to grow 2.6 in 2016 and 2.5 in 2017, an above-average growth rate in Europe, but it is not clear how a new parliament would govern the nation going forward.\nSpaniards have not seen this type of instability since the death of fascist leader Francisco Franco in 1975, resulting in the restoration of democracy. Analysts predict that the June election will do little in solving the political crisis and could lead to another election shortly thereafter.\nAnalysts are not certain how many projects and business ventures have been forestalled because of the gridlock, but prolonged stalemates will make the situation worse while enraging voters in the process.\nThe conservatives could advance in power due to widespread voter apathy, but Podemos could upend the Socialist Party through an alliance with the United Left Coalition, gaining an upper hand over rightist leaders. Regardless of the June outcome, all parties must appeal to the concerns of voters, as many Spaniards view the entire government as corrupt, while also failing to address their needs.\nSpain\u2019s government has been embroiled in several scandals, including within the royal family, fueling perceptions of a state that is out of touch, and incorrigible in terms of governance."}
{"idx": "10798", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: From the outset of the debt-ceiling fight, House Republicans have made two clear demands: any agreement to raise the debt limit must include offsetting cuts of at least $2.4 trillion and could not include any revenue increases. For a time, it appeared that some grand bargain to reform the tax code and entitlement programs might obviate these demands. But those talks fell apart. Democrats first pushed for a deal that would include roughly 3 to 1 spending cuts to revenue increases. Then 4 to 1. And then, last night, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid threw in the towel and announced he'll introduce a bill with at least $2.7 trillion in cuts and no revenue increases at all. That's a clear win for Republicans, although they're certain to ask for more.\nLast week, I predicted that the final deal would be $1.5-$2 trillion in cuts, no revenue and a stern lecture from President Obama. That was based on my belief that Republicans would not yield on taxes, and Democrats, unwilling to risk the economic damage from a default, would meekly agree to the cuts devised during the Biden negotiations. Such a deal wouldn't quite have met the Republican demand for $2.4 trillion--but I figured Republicans would not choose default over $1.5 trillion in cuts and no new taxes. In hindsight, I underestimated the Democrats' willingness to keep making concessions (in fairness, their capacity to do so seems practically limitless).\nThe extra trillion in cuts Reid conjured up appears to come from war spending, the formal name for which is Overseas Contingency Operations funds, or OCO funds. What are OCO funds? A bit of background: when Obama became president, one of his early, high-profile actions was to put the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan onto the books -- George W. Bush had kept them off budget to mask their costs. Administration officials applauded themselves for this act of honesty in budgeting, but one obvious effect was that the budget would grow. The CBO, the official budget scorekeeper, said the wars cost about $1.4 trillion a year decade. But Obama is (gradually) bringing both wars to an end, drawing down troops and thus also reducing costs. That's where the savings come from. Right now, CBO estimates future spending by project current costs forward, plus inflation. But if the budget were to formalize the drawdown that the president has already announced, CBO has said it would amount to a cut in outlays of $1.1 trillion over the next decade (and a savings of $1.4 trillion when you add in debt-servicing costs). So there's your extra trillion.\nIt's a bit gimmicky, yes. But Reid has good reason to think he might get away it -- Paul Ryan used the same gimmick in his budget, so Republicans are on record as accepting its validity.\nBut that shouldn't mask the larger point here, which is that the Democrats have capitulated utterly to Republican demands. Recall that last Tuesday, the bipartisan Gang of Six proposal included $2 trillion of revenue increases. Now, having offered to give this up, Democrats are sure to get no revenue.\nAs bad as this deal is for Democrats, it could have been worse (and could still get worse). Reid's deal would lift the debt ceiling through the 2012 election, so there wouldn't be another shakedown -- although John Boehner's counterproposal is built on a short-term raise that would require further cuts. Reid's proposal also protects the two sacred"}

This includes micromanaging coaches, acting out on the sidelines and applying pressure that leads to anxiety for the athletes themselves.\nSURVEY: How involved should parents be in their children's athletics?\nThe result is an athletic experience for children and teenagers that has become less enjoyable and more results-driven.\n\u201cThere is a fine line between being a supportive parent and being an overbearing one,\u201d said Dr. Leah Lagos, a clinical sports psychologist based in Manhattan who specializes in reducing athlete anxiety and boosting resiliency.\n\u201cA supportive one will be there from the sidelines to support the child, really focusing on the quality of the process and the effort,\" she added. \"And then there are parents that are over-involved. They\u2019re involved in every aspect from talking to coaches, the instruction, arguing with the coaches and the refs, shouting out at competitions.\nSix high school athletic directors, who recently participated in a panel discussion with The Journal News/lohud, were in agreement that overbearing behavior from parents has grown in recent years.\n\"There\u2019s an entire culture that\u2019s changed,\" said North Rockland AD Joe Casarella, who began coaching 52 years ago. \"Back when we started, blue collar parents would just be happy for their kids to play.\"\nThey all pointed to the rise of expensive travel teams and private lessons, which add to parents\u2019 level of expectation.\nDr. Travis Dorsch, a professor at Utah State University and former NFL punter, has devoted much of his research to the influence of parents on athletes. In a study he co-authored this year, the authors found that parents were spending as much as 10.28 percent of their gross household annual income on one child\u2019s youth sport experience.\nThis is commonly referred to as burnout, which can lead to a child developing a dislike for a sport they once enjoyed, and sometimes result in a desire to quit.\nAs a former coach at Nyack and current athletic director at Ardsley, Mike Ramponi bore witness to the increase in student-athletes devoting time and money into travel programs.\nAs the father of an 8-year-old who plays soccer, he\u2019s now experiencing it from a parent\u2019s perspective.\nIt\u2019s an increasingly difficult balance to find, especially with one-sport specialization taking hold in the last decade-plus.\nParents who push their children to focus on one sport often do so with dreams of a college scholarship awaiting them, or even a lucrative professional career.

Enter Ryan Mathews, who the Eagles have reached an agreement with, pending a physical, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. With Kelly affirming that Sam Bradford isn\u2019t in town to be traded for a shot at Marcus Mariota, it seems he\u2019s willing to take a chance on a couple of guys who haven\u2019t seen much playing time in the last year. Bradford was out all of last season and Mathews only played in six games. I\u2019ve avoided drafting or bidding on Mathews for the last few years, given his hit or miss tendencies. If he can stay healthy for a full season, he can do well, but he\u2019s only done that once in his career (2013). Maybe there\u2019s something to DeMarco Murray making a visit to Philly late Wednesday.\nJeremy Maclin officially signed with Kansas City on Wednesday, but you\u2019ve got to think his fantasy value takes a hit with Alex Smith as his quarterback. Everyone knows the Chiefs didn\u2019t connect on a touchdown pass to a wide receiver all of last year, but you also have to know that it can\u2019t get much worse. The move reunites Maclin with head coach Andy Reid, and I see Maclin as a much more consistent player and a better route runner than Dwayne Bowe.

{"idx": "10809", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: More and more companies are in the grip of a new phenomenon: \"metric fixation.\" Here's what's wrong with it.\nMore and more companies, government agencies, educational institutions and philanthropic organisations are today in the grip of a new phenomenon. I\u2019ve termed it \u2018metric fixation\u2019. The key components of metric fixation are the belief that it is possible \u2013 and desirable \u2013 to replace professional judgment (acquired through personal experience and talent) with numerical indicators of comparative performance based upon standardised data (metrics); and that the best way to motivate people within these organisations is by attaching rewards and penalties to their measured performance.\nThe rewards can be monetary, in the form of pay for performance, say, or reputational, in the form of college rankings, hospital ratings, surgical report cards and so on. But the most dramatic negative effect of metric fixation is its propensity to incentivise gaming: that is, encouraging professionals to maximise the metrics in ways that are at odds with the larger purpose of the organisation. If the rate of major crimes in a district becomes the metric according to which police officers are promoted, then some officers will respond by simply not recording crimes or downgrading them from major offences to misdemeanours. Or take the case of surgeons. When the metrics of success and failure are made public \u2014 affecting their reputation and income \u2014some surgeons will improve their metric scores by refusing to operate on patients with more complex problems, whose surgical outcomes are more likely to be negative. Who suffers? The patients who don\u2019t get operated upon.\nWhen reward is tied to measured performance, metric fixation invites just this sort of gaming. But metric fixation also leads to a variety of more subtle unintended negative consequences. These include goal displacement, which comes in many varieties: when performance is judged by a few measures, and the stakes are high (keeping one\u2019s job, getting a pay rise or raising the stock price at the time that stock options are vested), people focus on satisfying those measures \u2013 often at the expense of other, more important organisational goals that are not measured. The best-known example is \u2018teaching to the test\u2019, a widespread phenomenon that has distorted primary and secondary education in the United States since the adoption of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\nShort-termism is another negative. Measured performance encourages what the US sociologist Robert K Merton in 1936 called \u2018the imperious immediacy of interests \u2026 where the actor\u2019s paramount concern with the foreseen immediate consequences excludes consideration of further or other consequences\u2019. In short, advancing short-term goals at the expense of long-range considerations. This problem is endemic to publicly traded corporations that sacrifice long-term research and development, and the development of their staff, to the perceived imperatives of the quarterly report.\nTo the debit side of the ledger must also be added the transactional costs of metrics: the expenditure of employee time by those tasked with compiling and processing the metrics in the first place \u2013 not to mention the time required to actually read them. As the heterodox management consultants Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman note in Six Simple Rules (2014), employees end up working longer and harder at activities that add little to the real productiveness of their organisation, while sapping their enthusiasm. In an attempt to staunch the flow of faulty metrics through gaming, cheating and goal diversion, organisations often institute a cascade of rules, even as complying with them further slows down the institution\u2019s functioning and diminishes its efficiency.\nContrary to commonsense belief, attempts to measure productivity"}

It\u2019s also quite obvious that it\u2019s inspired by Frank Miller\u2019s Year One that took place a few years prior in the regular Batman series. That\u2019s definitely one of my favorite Batman stories, and looking back on it, it\u2019s quite amazing the influence it\u2019s had on the Batman mythos and even the way Batman comics were produced in its wake. Some of the events that occur in this particular arc are directly intertwined with Year One, but seen from a different perspective.\nI must say that this was rather an odd choice for the first story, since it involves Batman traveling to and from Alaska, occult rituals, and Native American mythology. It was also a bit surprising that the premise and climax are both based on supernaturalism. Batman is one of the few superheroes rooted in \u201crealism\u201d (by tights-n-fights standards, that is), so it\u2019s weird and awkward when magic and the supernatural plays a key role in the story. In the case of Shaman, it\u2019s minor enough that it\u2019s not completely distracting, but still prominent enough to irk me a little.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s a solid way to launch this series and still holds up all these years later.\nWritten by Bruce Jones. Art by Ariel Olivetti.\nThis is how Batman should be written in LOTDK \u2013 a solo adventure that doesn\u2019t rely on Oracle, Robin or the extended Batman family to help him out (though Alfred does a lot of the work \u2013 but what else is new). The crime in question is a fairly ordinary kidnapping and the villain is definitely not any of Batman\u2019s usual rogues, nor is there any cheesy supernatural component to it. Though it is a little too convenient that this case is closely connected with Bruce Wayne himself.\nThe story starts out simple and straightforward, but becomes more and more complex as the issues progress. In fact, I\u2019d say the major flaw to this book is that it\u2019s a little overlong and for rather arbitrary reasons. However, it is told like a standard mystery story so Batman finds a clue with leads him to one suspect who tips him off to another and so on and so forth. Jones\u2019s script is breezy enough to keep it constantly interesting and intriguing. I do find it to be rather melodramatic at times, though. There are many moments throughout this arc that seem a bit over the top, even by comic book standards (inter-tangled love trysts, blackmail, family scandals, secret identities, etc.).\nI like that there is no apparent villain, though Batman does encounter a few goons along the way. These situations are also a bit generic and predictable, but like I said, the comic is written well enough that it doesn\u2019t come across as a crutch or an easy cliche.\nMy only major complaint is that due to the lack of a traditional villain, there isn\u2019t a lot of action throughout any of these five chapters. Even the ending is completely lacking in a showdown \u2013 it just kind of ends. I do appreciate the fact that the villain\u2019s identity is a mystery to both Batman and the reader, so much so that when it\u2019s revealed it comes as just as much a shock to both parties.\nWritten by Denny O\u2019Neil.

He added: \"There won't be any deal for Iran to stay in.\"\nAs Zarif spoke in New York on Tuesday, Trump was meeting at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been leading an effort by France, Britain and Germany to find \"fixes\" to the deal that would satisfy Trump's objections. Few expect such a solution can be found by May 12, the date on which Trump has said he'll leave the deal if there's no fix agreed to with the Europeans.\n\"No one knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea,\" Trump said, referring to Macron. He said if he does withdraw, he would look to see \"if it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations, because this is a deal with decayed foundations.\"\nIn a bleak warning to Tehran, Trump added that if Iran ever threatens the United States, \"they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid.\"\nIran has been working feverishly to frame Trump's expected withdrawal as a major blot on the United States, just as America's closest allies in Europe try to persuade the president not to rip it up. U.S. and European officials say they've made major progress on two of Trump's demands \u2014 on nuclear inspections and Iran's ballistic missiles program. But talks have stalemated on Trump's third demand: that the deal be extended in perpetuity, rather than letting restrictions on Tehran to \"sunset\" after several years.\nWith exaggerated handshakes and a pair of kisses, President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron professed a sunny, best-friends relationship Tuesday, even as the two allies strained to bridge differences over the Iran nuclear agreement, Syria and more.\nIran has outright rejected any changes to the deal, arguing that it's unfair to impose more demands beyond what Tehran agreed to already. Trump's strategy relies on the assumption that if the U.S. and the Europeans unilaterally agree to new demands, Iran will back down and voluntarily comply in order to continue enjoying the benefits. Under the 2015 deal brokered by President Barack Obama and world powers, Iran agreed to nuclear restrictions in exchange for billions in sanctions relief.\nAnd even if a so-called add-on"}
{"idx": "10820", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The makers of a software program that monitors employees' computer use at work have a simple recipe for productivity: Work hard for 52 minutes, then take a break for 17.\nDeskTime \u2014 software that tracks how much time workers spend doing everything from making spreadsheets to watching cat videos \u2014 came up with that formula by examining their own data. The most productive 10 percent of its users, as noted in a piece published by The Muse last week, home in on their work for an average of 52 minutes straight. They then take a break from their computers for about a quarter of an hour before turning back to it.\n\"The common factor was they took few and long breaks,\" says Julia Gifford, who leads content marketing for the Draugiem Group, a business incubator in Riga, Latvia that counts DeskTime among its startups.\nDeskTime was originally created for Draugiem's own use. With many remote workers and a rapidly expanding workforce, the company needed a way to help monitor how people were working. It now offers the software to small and medium businesses as a product, and more than 36,000 employees are active users.\nThe tracking software might call to mind Big Brother (or at least some kind of cyber-loafing police), but Gifford calls DeskTime less invasive than other products that allow for screen captures or keystroke recordings. She says it all depends on how management teams use the program, and notes that it can also be useful to employees who are trying to manage their own time.\nDeskTime works by asking supervisors \u2014 with employees' input, if desired \u2014 to sort desktop applications and Web sites into three buckets. A financial analyst, for example, might label Excel \"productive,\" Facebook \"unproductive\" and certain news sites or online journals \"neutral.\" DeskTime then runs in the background, creating visual reports for both managers and employees to see how much time is spent in each bucket.\nRealizing DeskTime was sitting on a \"treasure trove\" of information about how people work, Gifford says, she asked a programmer to dive into the data. She wanted to find out what commonalities there were among the most productive DeskTime users \u2014 those 10 percent who spent the highest ratios of time on tools that had been labeled \"productive.\"\n\"We thought maybe they arrived later at work, maybe they worked during the night, maybe they took frequent breaks,\" Gifford says. But as it turned out, they took fewer breaks away from their computers, and longer ones. When the data were analyzed, Gifford says, she was surprised to find that \"the most productive employees also spend a lot of time away from the computer during the day, which is counterintuitive.\"\nGifford doesn't know if the breaks are what's actually causing the most productive workers to stay on task. They could, after all, just be less tempted by the latest Internet meme than their colleagues are. \"This entire experiment was just to see if maybe there is some kind of correlation, and we think it's interesting that the most productive people actually take pretty long breaks.\"\nAlso worth noting: Their breaks weren't used to answer email or check Facebook, but to step away from the computer entirely. Seventeen minutes might not seem all that long, but it's plenty of time to get a cup of coffee, walk around the block or catch up with a colleague. That is, if it's not being used up on cat videos."}
{"idx": "10821", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: PONTE VEDRA BEACH - Just 12 days from its marquee event, The Players Championship made an announcement Wednesday that's sure to last longer than one action-packed week in the beginning of May.\nSpeaking to an audience of more than 100 people, including children and community leaders, PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem revealed The Players intention to generate an eyebrow-raising $50 million for youth-related charities in North Florida over the next 10 years.\n\"Now that is an attainable goal that we will meet in partnership with our national sponsors in growing the message and the impact of the message to the community doing things right here that says we are going to help with this problem,\" Finchem said in front of the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse after a round of cheers died down.\nAt first glance, $50 million seems almost like a mythical number. In the 30 years that the golf tournament has been played at TPC Sawgrass, however, The Players has made a habit of turning even the biggest skeptics into believers.\nLast year alone, The Players donated a record $4.8 million to Northeast Florida charities. Since 1977, that number sits at around $40 million.\nThe key to Wednesday's announcement was a shift in focus. Of that nearly $5 million last year, around $2 million went to youth-related activities. Now, The Players is purposing to change gears and begin supporting these organizations on a new level.\nTo put in perspective how drastic this plan is, The Players has produced $15 million to this cause over the last decade. The goal is to more than triple that number, without neglecting the other charities as well.\nFinchem said the process will start by continuing the foundation already set, and refining some programs to generate more revenue. Also, community involvement has and will continue to increase.\n\"It will be a continuation in some cases of the programs we have supported in the past,\" he said. \"It will be an extension to some extent in support of the programs and in some cases it will be new programs.\"\nThe Players has announced some changes already, but most of them will be decided as time progresses. One example is the tournament's popular Birdies for Charity program, which raised $2.4 million in 2011. It has been expanded. Another is The Players Chip in for Youth Sports promotion, where youth organizations and qualified middle and high school athletic programs can promote the sale of \"any day\" tickets to The Players with proceeds going to the groups and to the First Tee.\nHow it affects St. Johns County is also hard to determine in the short term. For the most part, it will be about continuing an already strong relationship. A perfect example of that is the Boys & Girls Clubs of St. Augustine.\nThe club opened an activity center on King Street this past fall that's actually named after The Players Championship.\nThat honor comes from the $750,000, 10-year grant the club received five years ago. Dr. Shannon Perry, the president of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida, said The Players has been instrumental in helping the program grow in St. Augustine.\n\"Really we could have not opened the club without their support,\" Perry said. \"It is their namesake and it was a huge piece of rallying a community support and community commitment. ... I don't know from his announcement today what that means specifically but I do stand here very confident that they will honor their commitment and pledge to us as it has been existing for that first five years.

The service is still some time away, however, for the rest of Cook County, she said.\nIn the collar counties, 911 calls are directed to sheriff's dispatchers in most cases, she said, and the *999 calls continue to be handled by the Illinois Department of Transportation.\nAccording to industry surveys, about two-thirds of wireless-phone customers say that security is their main reason for buying the service.\nMaking 911 available to portable phones should make them an even more attractive device, especially since Chicago is the largest job center in the region.\nWireless phones in most of the country already use 911 for emergency calls.\nBut the systems face a major problem. When calls from land-line phones in homes or businesses reach emergency centers, dispatchers know the site from which the call was made. With a cell phone, however, there is no good way to tell where the caller is and what jurisdiction should get his call. Ameritech may provide a fix for this problem, too.\nLast year, the Federal Communications Commission mandated that wireless systems adopt technology to provide emergency dispatchers with location information. By next spring, they must provide the location of the cell base station handling the call and the caller's phone number. This only tells where the caller is within an area that can be several square miles.\nBy early in the next century, they must pinpoint the caller's location within about one-tenth of a mile.\nChicago-based Ameritech said Wednesday it has just signed a contract with SCC Communications Corp. of Boulder, Colo., to implement locator technology in its system.\nCellular One is still shopping for technology, said Dane Ershen, vice president of network operations.\nThere are several different ways to locate wireless phone users. All involve monitoring radio signals received from the caller by different system base stations and using triangulation geometry to pinpoint the caller's location.\nTechnology to pinpoint caller location was field-tested during the last year in Texas and New Jersey.\nOnce wireless phone systems have a better fix on where the caller is, they'll be able to direct the call to an emergency dispatcher with greater precision, Ershen said.\nIt is helpful to know the location of the base station handling a call and also the direction of the caller from the station, but the information can be vexing as well.\n\"Sometimes one base station will serve an area covered by several municipalities,\" Ershen said. \"You have to get representatives from every jurisdiction into a room to ask them where they want us to route the call.\"\nBecause of the imprecision, larger jurisdictions often take calls, such as a county sheriff's office for any base station in that county or the state"}

Prepare for disappointment.\nHopes are fading fast that Apple\u2019s all-in-one television set, which has entered tech folklore, will hit the market before the end of the year \u2014 or the next for that matter.\nFor five years there have been rumors that Apple would upend the traditional TV business and render the remote obsolete with a fully integrated, flat-screen panel capable of piping all sorts of content into the home.\nThe prediction from notorious Apple bull Gene Munster of Piper Jaffrey that the device will be here next month is running out of time to come true and seems even more unlikely as Apple has already had two major product launches in as many months.\nWhile Apples fans have visions of the company reinventing the TV business, there are big obstacles to it taking over the living room.\nFirst, blame the sad state of the TV set market, which has been hurt by oversupply, razor thin margins and slumping sales. It\u2019s so bad that Japanese giant Panasonic is exiting the business to focus on building smaller devices like tablets.\nBaker believes Apple has a better future with its set-top box that delivers content from the Internet than with selling actual TVs. It has sold more than 5 million of its $99 Apple TV devices in the past year.\nMeanwhile, the TV set business is in decline, with sales dropping every year since 2009. The average selling price of a TV is about $500, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. That\u2019s a far cry from Munster \u2019s prediction that an Apple TV set would cost up to $2,000.\nNevertheless, with 10.5 million TVs expected to be sold during the holidays this year, even a small percentage of those sales would lift Apple\u2019s bottom line. The company could be looking at $2 billion in revenue for every million TVs sold.\nThe key to profitability, however, is in the sales of TV shows and movies and other content that could stream through the Internet into Apple\u2019s coffers. Yet there are reasons the TV business isn\u2019t exactly welcoming Apple with open arms.\nDespite the rise of cord-cutting options such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the cable-TV business isn\u2019t in dire shape like the music business was when Apple disrupted it a decade ago.\nIn fact, trying to \u201cunbundle\u201d programming the same way Apple broke up the record album and started selling single songs on iTunes is getting tougher in some respects for newcomers.\nFacing threats to their ad business, broadcasters and cable TV networks have increased their reliance on revenue from cable and satellite operators that deliver a standard TV package.\nIndeed, the broadcast networks and their local affiliates are asking pay-TV providers to pay up for content that was once free. So-called retransmission fees are now a booming business for the broadcasters and only strengthen their ties to big distributors like Comcast and Time Warner."}

Diplomacy requires discretion, and when the ability of American diplomats to communicate discreetly is undermined, tensions rise.\nThe celebration of Manning (complete with an invitation, since rescinded, to serve in absentia as a grand marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade) is part of a broader media celebration of leakers. This sort of makes sense: leaks of classified information are good for the press, since they make our jobs easier and more interesting. Access to information that is supposed to be secret makes the press more powerful.\nBut what's good for the press is only sometimes good for the public. The CEO of the Associated Press has complained that, by subpoenaing its phone records in its investigation of a person who leaked classified information about an anti-terror operation to the AP, the Justice Department has made some sources less willing to talk. Well, that's the point: the point of investigations and prosecutions is to get people with security clearances not to leak classified information, because it's desirable for the government to be able to keep secrets.\nThe government keeps too many secrets, which is part of why it has trouble convincing the public and press that leaks are bad. But the solution overclassification is to classify less; it is not a justification for public servants to violate the terms of their security clearances.\nNor should we be conflating leakers with whistleblowers. As noted by Professor Richard Rosen, who runs the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech, whistleblowers' legal right is to go to inspectors general within the government or to Congress, not to the press. Occasionally, even illegal leaks further the public interest (such as that of the Pentagon Papers) but the onus is on the leaker to be sure he's leaking the actually publicly relevant information -- not an indiscriminate trove of documents, as Manning is accused of.\nManning, like anyone else accused of breaching a security clearance, deserves due process and a fair trial.

Precipitation-soaked soil on top of the tunnel would have increased the weight on the tunnel\u2019s flat roof made of timbers.\nThe coming winter also could be unusually wet, Al Farabee, a DOE Hanford project director, told the advisory board this week.\nThe state is legally required to hold a 45-day public comment period, which it plans to start on Aug. 13, according to the Department of Ecology. Public hearings are planned 5:30 p.m. Aug. 27 at the Richland library and Sept. 5 in Seattle.\nThe mayors of Kennewick, Richland, Pasco and West Richland sent a letter July 31 to Smith, saying they were frustrated by how long the state was taking to make a decision.\nThey criticized the state for holding public meetings, saying DOE already held a public comment period this spring.\nThe state meetings \u201ccould potentially delay, as much as a year, the action recommended by the panel of experts, which will reduce the risk to our region of a potentially catastrophic tunnel collapse,\u201d said the letter from the mayors.\nBut the state said it could not hold its required public comment period until DOE finished its public process and then provided the state with more information.\nThe issue stems from the partial collapse in May 2017 of the older of two PUREX plant waste storage tunnels.\nThen DOE moved quickly under emergency conditions to stabilize the tunnel, including beginning to fill it with grout within six weeks \u2014 public comment requirements were waived because of emergency conditions.\nOfficials later heard complaints at the Hanford Advisory Board and other meetings that there was no opportunity for public comment.\nThis video uses animation to show how DOE and contractor CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company would fill waste storage Tunnel 2 near PUREX with grout to prevent a collapse, while allowing for future removal of the waste from the tunnel.\nQuestions have been raised about how rail cars filled with waste could be removed eventually from a tunnel filled with grout, although DOE says cutting up the grouted waste and removing it should be possible.\nThe partial collapse of the first tunnel triggered a structural analysis of the second and longer waste storage tunnel, which was built in 1964, eight years after the first.\nThe analysis found the 1,700-foot tunnel also was at serious risk of collapse.\nA panel of experts appointed by DOE determined that grouting the tunnel, which holds 28 rail cars loaded with highly radioactively contaminated equipment, was the best option to prevent a collapse and possible airborne release of radioactive contamination.\nGovernment agencies were working through the public process to reach a decision on grouting the tunnel, when DOE\u2019s concerns increased this spring.\nShoop said the construction of the second tunnel, which used steel beams, is a concern because if one beam falls, it"}

{"idx": "10839", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: On Wednesday, thousands of workers throughout the University of California (UC) higher education system struck in a one-day action across the state. UC is the largest public institution of higher learning in the world, comprised of 10 campuses, five medical centers, 16 health professional schools, three national laboratories and numerous satellite facilities.\nThe action was the second one-day strike called by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 in less than a month. Participation in the first strike, called on March 20, was much higher than on Wednesday.\nThe exact number of those who engaged in the strike has not been reported, but many media outlets reported 200-300 strikers at each of the campuses. This compares to nearly 1,000 picketers at each of the 10 campuses in last month\u2019s walkout.\nThe decline is an indictment of the self-defeating policy of the union, which is designed to wear down the workers rather than mobilize the support that exists in the working class for their struggle. By calling token one-day actions and isolating the workers from other education workers and the working class as a whole, the union hopes to dissipate the workers\u2019 anger and militancy and force them to accept a sellout agreement.\nTwo days of lost wages, costing between $150 and $300, is a major sacrifice for workers who make a poverty wage and face high living costs. AFSCME 3299 members are some of the lowest paid workers in the system, occupying positions such as admitting clerks, anesthesia technicians, MRI technologists, cooks, gardeners, security guards and janitorial staff. The union has kept them on the job without a contract since June 30, 2017.\nAFSCME provides no strike pay, despite its large bank balance. Instead, it squanders the workers\u2019 dues payments on donations to politicians of the two big business parties, mainly those of the Democratic Party, which is overseeing the union membership\u2019s impoverishment in California. According to Opensecrets.org, AFSCME handed over $13,397,952 to candidates, primarily Democrats, in the last election cycle.\nThe workers are demanding wages that keep up with rising living costs, an end to the outsourcing of jobs and use of temporary labor, and rejection of the 401(k)-style pension plan the Democratic Party-controlled UC Regents are attempting to impose on them.\nThe UC Office of the President (UCOP) has issued warnings before each of the strikes that workers who call in sick on those days will be required to present a doctor\u2019s note. In addition, the university system has hired hundreds of strikebreakers. The University of California uses the ten-day strike notice given by the union to hire scabs, recruited by agencies such as Huffmaster and Healthsource Global Staffing.\nStrike breakers brought by bus to UC San Diego Campus.\nThe UC system plays a critical role in setting the bar for wages and working conditions throughout the state and beyond. It is the largest non-governmental employer in California, the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, with a gross domestic product larger than that of the United Kingdom.\nOverseeing the vicious anti-labor policy is the president of the UC system, the former secretary of homeland security under Obama, Janet Napolitano.\nWSWS reporters spoke to striking workers at the UC Los Angeles and UC San Diego medical centers."}

You have the health care regulations that you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere you look, behind every nook and cranny. You have environmental regulations, and that&apos;s a whole area killing small businesses, particularly where I live in California. California farmers are getting rooned at the expense of the protection of certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw the national labor relations board war against Boeing. If you add it all up, it adds a lot of uncertainty and it paralyzes new hiring.\nRICK UNGAR: Actually no, I&apos;m always amazed when people say that. I was a small business man for a very long time. I had the same hassles that everybody has ,but there were never regulations and said \u2018boy if we could just get rid of these regulation, I&apos;d be making a lot more money.&apos; As you said, a lot of the things we are talking about here are state -based and don&apos;t have an impact on the economy. Because last year was an election year, we actually have a very small number of regulations that are hitting us as we go into the New Year.\nELIZABETH MACDONALD: They are supposed to release it between April and October but they buried it in the dead of night. These proposed new rules are going to cost the economy $128 billion, that&apos;s one estimate out there. Even Russia&apos;s czar Nicholas said &apos;I don&apos;t rule Russia, my bureaucrats, and my mini czars do.&apos; That&apos;s what we have going on in this country. Rich Karlgaard has it right. We have bureaucrats justifying their own existence by creating their own rules. What happens with small businesses, they have to hire their own bureaucrats to deal with government bureaucrats.\nMORGAN BRENNAN: I think it&apos;s important to make the point that regulations are necessary. That&apos;s something that Gov. Romney said in the first presidential debate. For every poorly written regulation, we have some that are very smartly written, especially on the state level as far as what&apos;s rolling out this year. Case-in-point, Oregon is coming out with a law that makes employers not discriminate against unemployed applicants. It&apos;s very important especially with long term unemployed. We see a lot of discrimination there and that&apos;s good for the economy.\nSTEVE FORBES: They are indeed David, people who love regulations always make it a choice between anarchy and regulations, it isn&apos;t. Regulations cost this economy $1.75 trillion a year. A lot of them are unnecessary, and in terms of job creation, having banks I know of, a mid-size bank had to hire 1,000 people for compliance, that means hundreds of fewer loan officers, one reason why small and medium size businesses are struggling. Regulations are a burden, pure and simple.\nVICTORIA BARRET: Absolutely because each regulation is a hidden cost of doing business. Rich put it right in the beginning, which is that these small businesses have to go out and hire someone to keep track of all these regulations and that&apos;s hiring that isn&apos;t going towards productivity, towards growing their businesses and growing the economy.

But that\u2019s not the case for James Gunn\u2018s Guardians of the Galaxy, which is currently in the process of assembling an all-new cast.\nLast month, the shortlist to play Peter Quill revealed to five contenders: Joel Edgerton, Jack Huston, Jim Sturgess, Lee Pace, and Eddie Redmayne. Now Marvel Studios has narrowed the options down to two. Sturgess is the only one of the original group that remains in contention, while Zachary Levi has emerged as a surprise finalist. More details after the jump.\nAlso known as Star-Lord, Quill is a half-alien, half-human NASA astronaut who becomes the leader of the titular team of intergalactic protectors. Other members of the team include Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Gamora. None of the roles have finalized casting at this point.\nAlthough Levi\u2019s name wasn\u2019t featured on last month\u2019s list of potentials, Variety reports that Marvel Studios has long had Levi on their radar. The actor was initially in talks to play Fandral in 2011\u2019s Thor before his commitment to Chuck forced him to drop out, and he was replaced by Joshua Dallas.\nWhat\u2019s a little weird is that Marvel Studios has already succeeded in casting Levi in one of their other projects. Ironically enough, scheduling conflicts proved an issue for Dallas in Thor: The Dark World, and Levi was cast to take over the role. That means if Levi gets the Guardians gig, he\u2019ll be playing two distinct and unrelated roles within the same universe. But that\u2019s a fairly big if at this point. While Levi and Sturgess are the current favorites, the studio may also test another, unnamed third actor in the coming weeks.\nLevi is mainly known for his TV work, though he\u2019s broken through into features from time to time. His highest-profile movie project to date is Tangled, in which he voiced dashing rogue Flynn Rider. Needless to say, Star-Lord would prove a bit step up for his film career.

She also said Manafort was closely involved in his own finances.\nHeather Washkuhn, managing director of the accounting firm NKSFB, arrives at the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse in Alexandria, Va., on Thursday to testify in the Paul Manafort trial.\nDay 3 of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's federal trial on bank and tax fraud charges began Thursday, in much the same way Wednesday ended: with prosecutors illustrating what Manafort spent his money on and, more important, the method he used to spend it.\nThe first two witnesses Thursday and the final six witnesses Wednesday spoke to Manafort's luxurious lifestyle: The chief operating officer of a home electronics company said Manafort spent over $2 million with his company over five years; a landscaper testified about putting flower-lined tennis courts on Manafort's property; and a manager of a menswear boutique said Manafort spent $330,000 on suits within a three-year period.\nBut in the Alexandria, Va., courtroom, Judge T.S. Ellis III has been quick to question whether Manafort's expensive taste is relevant to the case. It's not illegal to be wealthy, he said Wednesday.\nProsecutors for the government filed a motion Wednesday night, however, arguing that what Manafort spent his money on is valid. They argue it proves Manafort's \"willful intent\" to deceive the government. And, they also argue, his expensive lifestyle demonstrates why he lied, they say, to acquire bank loans when his income dried up.\nThe witnesses have also all testified that Manafort paid them with overseas wire transfers, mostly from accounts in Cyprus \u2014 accounts that his bookkeeper and accountant testified Thursday they didn't know about.\n\"The funds used to pay the vendors came directly from the unreported foreign bank accounts where Manafort deposited his foreign consulting income,\" prosecutors wrote in their Wednesday filing. \"Manafort's practice of paying his vendors directly with his offshore funds was designed to hide the underlying income from his bookkeepers and return preparers, and ultimately the IRS.\"\nProsecutors argue that Manafort's direct relationships with many of the vendors who testified also cut into the defense's argument that it was actually his assistant Rick Gates who was behind many of the financial crimes Manafort is accused of.\nOn Thursday, Ellis said he would allow prosecutors to introduce how much Manafort spent, but he discouraged them from going into intense detail or showing pictures of exactly what he spent it on \u2014 or to \"gild the lily,\" as Ellis put it.\nStill, prosecutors were able to elicit detailed testimony on Manafort's expenditures from two witnesses.\nJoel Maxwell, the chief operating officer of a technology company, told the jury about the $2 million in work he did for Manafort from 2011-2014, while Michael Regolizio, the owner of a landscaping company, told them of his work on a 1 1/2-acre Manafort estate in the Hamptons, including the large flower bed of white flowers with an \"M\" spelled out in red flowers on the property.\nBoth Maxwell and Regolizio testified that Manafort paid via international wire transfer.

Among black students, only 17 percent tested proficient or better in reading, and just 7 percent reached at least a proficient level in math.\nThe atrocious NAEP performance is only a fraction of the bad news. Nationally, our high school graduation rate is over 80 percent.\nThat means high school diplomas, which attest that these students can read and compute at a 12th-grade level, are conferred when 63 percent are not proficient in reading and 75 percent are not proficient in math.\nFor blacks, the news is worse.\nRoughly 75 percent of black students received high school diplomas attesting that they could read and compute at the 12th-grade level. However, 83 percent could not read at that level, and 93 percent could not do math at that level.\nIt\u2019s grossly dishonest for the education establishment and politicians to boast about unprecedented graduation rates when the high school diplomas, for the most part, do not represent academic achievement. At best, they certify attendance.\nFraudulent high school diplomas aren\u2019t the worst part of the fraud. Some of the greatest fraud occurs at the higher education levels \u2014 colleges and universities.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70 percent of white high school graduates in 2016 enrolled in college, and 58 percent of black high school graduates enrolled in college.\nHere are my questions to you: If only 37 percent of white high school graduates test as college-ready, how come colleges are admitting 70 percent of them? And if roughly 17 percent of black high school graduates test as college-ready, how come colleges are admitting 58 percent of them?\nIt\u2019s inconceivable that college administrators are unaware that they are admitting students who are ill-prepared and cannot perform at the college level. Colleges cope with ill-prepared students in several ways.\nThey provide remedial courses. One study suggests that more than two-thirds of community college students take at least one remedial course, as do 40 percent of four-year college students.\nCollege professors dumb down their courses so that ill-prepared students can get passing grades. Colleges also set up majors with little analytical demands so as to accommodate students with analytical deficits. Such majors often include the term \u201cstudies,\u201d such as ethnic studies, cultural studies, gender studies and American studies.\nThe major for the most ill-prepared students, sadly enough, is education. When students\u2019 SAT scores are ranked by intended major, education majors place 26th on a list of 38 (https:// tinyurl.com/pjmga9y).\nColleges are admitting youngsters who have not mastered what used to be considered a ninth-grade level of proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic. Often, when they graduate from college, they still can\u2019t master even a 12th-grade level of academic proficiency.

The Business Tax Holiday program was unanimously approved by the Westminster City Council last week.\nThe idea was proposed by Mayor Tri Ta and is in honor of National Small Business Week, which is in May. The policy should become a mainstay of the city\u2019s business recruitment plans because why a business has to pay to register with a city has always been a dubious proposition.\nCurrently, the city\u2019s business license tax is based on sales receipts and falls somewhere between $223.50 and $2,623.50, \u201cdepending on the type of businesses,\u201d according to a city staff report.

I only had to lean into his gait as he traversed the dunes, allowing me to take in the vistas.\nWhile Bodega Bay can be foggy and chilly, this particular weekend was sunny \u2014 and I\u2019d hedged my bets, staying overnight at a ranch just a mile north of town, so I could spend two days exploring the quiet inland hills and, later, the beach while on horseback.\nIt was my first time riding, although the excursion had been on my mind for months: As a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Bill Lane Center for the American West this year, I have been researching women farmers and ranchers throughout the region, and how their numbers have increased over the past three decades. The cattlewomen I\u2019d met from Montana, New Mexico and California\u2019s Central Valley had impressed me in particular. Some offered me the chance to join them on cattle drives \u2014 provided I get comfortable riding horseback.\nWith its mix of 28 retired and rescued quarter horses, thoroughbreds, Arabs, Appaloosas and Belgian drafts, the 378-acre Chanslor Ranch turned out to be an ideal introduction to the sport. Calling ahead to reserve a room \u2014 there are only three, although camping sites are also available \u2014 I booked two rides. A guided hourlong jaunt would take me along the Blacktail Trail, with generous views to the bay. Sunday\u2019s ride out to the beach, I later learned, is the ranch\u2019s most popular, and with good reason: The sandy trail is bordered by eye-catching, luscious succulents and wild grass wafting in the wind, and the descent to the water down along the dunes is a picture-perfect idyll.\nAs I saddled up for the hills ride that first day, I watched as a family from Torino, Italy \u2014 mother, father, and four charming boys, all dressed in matching white Oxford shirts and baby-blue shorts \u2014 mounted their horses. Ascending the first hill, they happily told me about their monthlong tour across Polynesia, Mexico, Utah and now California.\nFlour, my white Arab-Welsh mix, lumbered behind the others. As we reached the summit, Angel, our guide, told me that the horse is among the ranch\u2019s dearest residents. A rescue, she\u2019d been found emaciated and nearly abandoned in the backyard of a suburban house in Central California.\nLater, I drove into Bodega Bay and ordered fish tacos dripping with tangy guacamole at The Birds Cafe. I ate them out on the patio, feet up on a stool, watching the sunset with a blanket draped over my shoulders. It was a lovely way to end the day. I slept deeply at the ranch, although the walls are rather thin and I could hear my neighbors chatting by a campfire.\nThe next day, our group \u2014 which included a 20-something couple from Reno and several older women from Fairfield \u2014 headed down a sandy, shaded path on horseback, over dunes and around groves of cypress trees toward the beach.

Something had happened to my hamstring, and my hamstring didn\u2019t want me to run. It wouldn\u2019t be wanting me to run for quite some time, in fact. I was injured.\nNothing about this is all that serious. I\u2019m not a professional athlete. No money will be lost, no career will be damaged, no sponsorship deal will be affected. Nor is the injury terribly bad. It will heal and I will run again and may one day even be a better runner for having had this experience (and many others like it). I do not expect or deserve sympathy. But I do want to talk about what being an injured runner is like, at least for me, and I suspect others.\nWhen you are truly committed, irrespective of ability, running can start to define you. You don\u2019t necessarily mean for it to happen, but as you run more and you get better, and the challenges build up and you continue to meet them, it gives you a lift. Much of the time you spend away from home or at work is based around running. Before you know it, your sense of identity is inextricably linked with your standing as a runner. The regular challenges, the immediate feedback and the real accomplishments that running can provide are all a major boost to your self-esteem. All of which is fine when you\u2019re doing well, but take running away suddenly and you can find yourself feeling adrift.\nUnable to go out and run, you are left without the social network that has given you so much support. And there are constant reminders of the things you can\u2019t do. You don\u2019t want to look on Strava, for example, but you can\u2019t help it and the loneliness and the frustration get worse. Running injuries are mostly internal things, and because there are no visible wounds you can\u2019t see the healing process. You never really know how long it will be.\nIn my own case, it couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time. It was mid-summer and the races were piling up. The mile race we were training for when the injury happened is one of the highlights of my year, a few days after this there was the last in a league of 10k races and I was in the overall lead. The following Saturday I was planning to run my first fell race, and a few more track races were lined up for the weeks after. It was immediately obvious I wouldn\u2019t be running the mile race, and one by one, as the day of each of the other races approached, I would be forced to admit that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\nMissing the mile, and losing the lead of the 10k series, and not doing the fell race that had been in the diary for six months were not what really hurt though. The day after I got injured was my seven-year-old\u2019s sports day. There was a dad\u2019s race; he\u2019d asked me if I\u2019d do it and I\u2019d told him I would.

OOIDA Member Greg Herden of Brockway, Mont., is a farmer who hauls his agricultural products in the upper Midwest.\nIn 2012 he received a fine of $1,474 in the mail after Minnesota state troopers in the civil weights enforcement division were going through receipts at a grain elevator and found receipts they claimed showed that three overweight loads were hauled. Greg represented himself in court and told the judge that no weight limits exist for private roads in Minnesota, and that the troopers could not prove that his truck traveled on federal or state highways. The judge agreed and ruled in his favor.\nUnfortunately, the judge did not agree with the argument that using private receipts to issue the citation was a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. And while state officials say state statutes allow for the investigation of receipts at private scales, that didn\u2019t sit well with Greg.

Sudfeld signed his one-year, $3.095 million restricted tender on Monday.\nUPDATE: The Eagles have made the move official.\nSudfeld is likely to serve as the backup to starting quarterback Carson Wentz this season. He spent the last two seasons as the third quarterback on the depth chart behind Wentz and Nick Foles, who is now in Jacksonville. Despite his position on the depth chart, Sudfeld served as Foles\u2019 backup for several games over the last two seasons following Wentz\u2019s back-to-back season-ending injuries.\nSudfeld has appeared in three games over the last two seasons. He completed 20-of-25 passes for 156 passing yards and a touchdown during his limited regular season action.\nThe backup quarterback has had two years to learn behind Wentz and Foles, so he should be ready for a bigger role. He will compete with recently added Luis Perez for reps during the offseason program. Sudfeld enters that battle as the runaway favorite for the backup quarterback job.\nPerez is coming off an eight-game stint with the Alliance of American Football\u2019s Birmingham Iron. Perez will most likely serve as a developmental quarterback behind Wentz and Sudfeld.\nWith Sudfeld in the mix, the Eagles can spread out their passing reps during the offseason program. Wentz is recovering from a stress fracture in his back, so the Eagles may want to ease him into action. Sudfeld knows the offense and the majority of his offensive teammates really well.

Kamal Abdel-Marouf al-Mahi, who was ousted along with Defense Minister Awad Mohammed ibn Ouf a day after al-Bashir\u2019s overthrow.\nSince his ouster, al-Bashir \u2013 president for nearly 30 years \u2013 has been under house arrest in Khartoum. The military said he was removed from power in response to the demands of the people.\nA military spokesman said Sunday it will name a civilian prime minister and Cabinet but not a president to help govern the country. The announcement was unlikely to satisfy the protesters. Lt. Gen. Shamseldin Kibashi said in televised remarks that the military had begun to overhaul the security apparatus and wouldn\u2019t break up the demonstrations outside the military headquarters.\nSudan\u2019s uprising began in December as a series of protests against the rising costs of fuel and food, but soon shifted to calls for al-Bashir to step down. Dozens of people were killed in a security crackdown aimed at quashing the protests.\nThe protests against al-Bashir gained further momentum after Algeria\u2019s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years, resigned earlier this month in response to weeks of similar protests.\nPublished: April 15, 2019, 11:26 a.m."}

Today, China, an emerging superpower, is celebrating his \u201cgenius,\u201d while Marxist ideology is gaining adherents among a whole new generation in the West.\nDuring the period of rapid social mobility after the Second World War, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union, socialist ideas fell into deserved disrepute. In contrast, today\u2019s resurgence reflects both historical ignorance, particularly among the young, and the marked failure of contemporary capitalism to offer a credible scenario for a better future.\nSocialism\u2019s comeback extends across a broad spectrum of countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, France as well as in the United States. In France\u2019s election last year the former Trotskyite Jean-Luc Melenchon won the under-24 vote, beating the \u201cyouthful\u201d Emmanuel Macron by almost two to one. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the birthplace of modern capitalism, Labour, under the neo-Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, won over 60 percent of the vote among voters under 40, compared to just 23 percent for the Conservatives.\nA Pew poll finds that 43 percent of millennials feel positively about the word \u201csocialism\u201d compared to less than half that for people over 50. By 2024, these millennials will be the biggest voting bloc. Left-wing candidates, including some Democratic socialists, did surprisingly well in the most recent primaries.\nPolls of millennials show consistently that economic issues, such as jobs and college debt, are their dominant concerns. Issues like transgender rights, or climate change, may motivate the media and denizens of university hothouses, but for most young people more critical are those that impact their lives in a more immediate way.\nThe current ruling oligarchy, centered on Wall Street and Silicon Valley, has no real program to address these concerns outside of occasional proposals to provide guaranteed incomes and subsidies for what they see as increasingly extraneous masses. But many millennials may not feel so positive about a dismal future as \u201cgig economy\u201d drones. They certainly show little signs of capitalist ardor. Relatively few are starting businesses and fully half, notes a Harvard study, believe \u201cthe American dream\u201d is dead. Under these conditions promises of guaranteed jobs, free college and single-payer health care are far more attractive.\nSimilarly high rents and diminished prospects for home ownership naturally creates growing support for rent control and massive subsidies for housing. This is particularly true in the most overpriced markets (for young people especially) on the West Coast and in the Northeast. Even in Orange County, rent control has the support of nearly three in five voters, according to a recent Chapman University poll.\nWho will pay for an expansive new socialist agenda? So far progressive politicians have financed their current plans by targeting the wallets of the middle class. But, increasingly, leftist politicians are looking at the biggest piles of cash, which reside in the bank accounts of the tech and financial oligarchies. The proto-socialist City Council in Seattle, second only to the Bay Area as a center of new tech wealth, recently passed a wealth tax to pay for homeless services.\nIn San Francisco, progressives increasingly see themselves in a struggle against what they see as a \u201creal-estate/tech mogul party.\u201d This came up in the recent brouhaha over state Sen.

Richard Green in the complaint.\nCourt files indicate Cochran has yet to responded to the allegations. She declined to comment when reached by a reporter.\nThings began to fall apart for HiCaliber in 2017 when online attacks targeted the rescue. Numerous investigations by various local and state agencies began, and HiCaliber\u2019s extensive online fundraising abilities were crippled.\nCochran called her detractors haters and said the accusations were borne from jealousy about the success of her operation. She said her personality also made enemies in the horse rescue world.\nIn April, Cochran announced the ranch would close by June and the more than 100 horses on the property would be adopted out. By Dec. 13, when sheriff\u2019s deputies came to the property to execute the eviction, there were still a couple dozen horses on the property and volunteers said conditions at the ranch had deteriorated dramatically.\nCochran and co-defendant Romney Snyder were allowed to take 22 horses to another ranch in Valley Center. The location of that property has not been revealed.\nLater that day, according to published reports, Markstein and others toured the property and found the main home and other buildings trashed. A spokesman for Markstein and her husband, Travis Fox, said the ranch was filthy.\nMarkstein told the nonprofit news organization inewsource.org that the damage to the main house was extensive and included urine-soaked floors. A spokesman said after the eviction the body of a baby horse was found buried in a pile of manure.\nIn a statement, Fox said that when a professional cleaning company came onto the property following the eviction, workers wore hazardous material suits while cleaning the main house.\nMarkstein told inewsource she had been trying to get Cochran and the others off the property for months, but the legal process took time.\nBack in 2014, things were far different. HiCaliber was about to be evicted from a smaller property in northern Escondido where a monastery that had been leasing some of its land to what was then a much smaller rescue operation decided it needed the property for expansion.\nAn article in a horse-related magazine depicting Hi"}

The city could buy land from Hoyt Street at a discount to get more affordable housing off the ground.\nToday, Hoyt Street has missed its target. Only 30 percent of the nearly 2,000 units built under the deal are affordable, according to city documents obtained under the state's public records law. Three complexes now in the pipeline will bring Hoyt Street's affordable housing rate even lower, to 28 percent.\nHoyt Street would need to develop 258 affordable units to catch up to the city's target, an analysis by The Oregonian shows.\nYet the city has not brought down the hammer.\nDespite knowing for months about the shortfall and a quickly approaching Sept. 8 deadline to exercise its purchase option, officials with the city have taken no documented steps to force Hoyt Street to sell land for modestly priced housing.\nTraci Manning, director of the Portland Housing Bureau, said in an email this week that the city is working to get the \"best information\" before deciding what to do. She said regardless of how Hoyt Street's affordability record is measured ultimately, \"it will be close to target.\"\n\"That's pretty sad,\" Debbie Aiona, action chairwoman for the League of Women Voters of Portland, said of progress on affordable housing. \"You'd think they could have performed better.\"\nThe failure involving Hoyt Street Properties is just the latest example of high-minded Portland planning falling short. Despite city goals to sprinkle affordable housing amid heavily subsidized redevelopment efforts in the Pearl and South Waterfront districts, production targets have gone unfulfilled.\nPortland's inability to deliver should give residents pause the next time a big redevelopment project is proposed, said former city Commissioner Gretchen Kafoury, who voted in support of the Hoyt Street deal.\n\"How can the public have confidence that those targets will be met?\" Kafoury asked. \"And the answer is, they can't \u2013 unless they elect people who really care about this stuff.\"\nPortland planners' vision for the Pearl District began taking shape in 1988, when the City Council designated the rail yards north of Lovejoy Street for new housing. Six years later, the City Council approved an ambitious housing strategy for more than 5,500 new units in the old warehouse district north of West Burnside Street.\nPortland struck a deal in 1997 with Hoyt Street Properties to renovate a former rail yard into high-density housing. The developers have helped transform the old warehouse district but they didn't deliver enough affordable housing.\nCity officials knew that they'd need to subsidize housing construction for residents of modest means. In 1994, the City Council set a \"target\" that at least 35 percent -- but as many as 55 percent -- of the new units would be affordable for individuals or families earning up to 80 percent of the median income.\n"}

Abdul Raziq, the Kandahar police commander, was killed outside the provincial governor's office on Thursday, when a bodyguard opened fire on a group of officials as they left a meeting with Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.\nMiller was not injured but the regional intelligence agency commander was killed and the provincial governor severely wounded, decimating the leadership of one of the country's most strategically important provinces.\nAlthough nominally a provincial police chief, Raziq was one of the most powerful political figures in Afghanistan and a formidable opponent of the Taliban, with unchallenged authority across the volatile south of the country.\nThe decision to suspend the vote in Kandahar province was taken over the objections of some officials who warned that any delay would threaten the whole process and hand the Taliban a major propaganda victory.\nSaturday's election had been seen as a major test of the government's credibility and ability to organize a nationwide ballot ahead of the more important presidential election next April.\nBut the shock of Raziq's death meant the people of Kandahar were \"morally not ready to vote,\" Hafizullah Hashimi, spokesman of the Independent Election Commission, said.\nThe Taliban issued a fresh warning not to take part in the election on Friday, telling people to stay at home and saying it would shut down roads and would be \"closely monitoring all developments.\"\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a statement of its own expressing concern at Taliban statements pledging attacks on schools and other buildings used as polling centres.\n\"UNAMA urges the Taliban to respect and protect civilians and not to threaten them or carry out violence should they engage in their constitutional right to participate in elections,\" it said.\nOn top of the mounting security concerns, the elections were already dogged by serious technical and organizational problems, notably around the use of untested biometric voter verification equipment rushed in after allegations of widespread voter fraud.\nThursday's attack underlined how precarious the situation remains in Afghanistan after more than 17 years of war despite preliminary contacts between Taliban and U.S. officials to find a basis for future peace talks.\nU.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said it was too soon to say what effect Raziq's death would have but added that the U.S. military's mission was unaltered.\n\"We need to find who's done this,\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him in the southeast Asian city-state of Singapore. \"But right now, we are going toward the election and we will continue to defend the Afghan people.\"\nHe said he did not believe the attack would affect U.S. military movements around Afghanistan or Gen. Miller's security arrangements.\n\"You're going to start asking questions about, 'Well, how trustworthy are they? What influence do they really have?'\" said one former Defence Department official who left the Pentagon recently, referring to the Taliban.\n\"And you know the bottom-line question is, 'Why are we still dealing with them?' or 'Should we deal with them?'\"\nMattis was cautious about whether the Thursday attack could hit voter turnout but said the U.S. aim of finding a negotiated,"}
{"idx": "10888", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare?\nIn the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.\nThe seeds of the conflict were sown in 2003, when Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), which gives seniors a prescription drug benefit that is sold and administered by private insurers, not the government. This drug benefit, known as Part D, opened new markets for insurers, some of which have profited handsomely from the government\u2019s gift. The story of one of those companies, Humana, a forty-six-year-old carrier based in Louisville, Kentucky, shows what\u2019s at stake.\nBefore 2003 Humana, a regional company peddling health insurance, including HMOs, was hardly a household name. One of its policies had been a big money loser, and the company was struggling to dig its way out of a financial hole. Vice president Steve Brueckner called the MMA \u201can unprecedented opportunity to establish relationships,\u201d and his company made the most of it. Humana gained 4 million new policyholders and reported to stockholders in April that it had amassed \u201crecord breaking revenues.\u201d What\u2019s more, Humana has become a national brand poised to sell policies in the non-Medicare market, where people will increasingly be forced to buy their own health coverage, especially if an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d becomes a solution for the country\u2019s healthcare woes. \u201cPart D transformed the company,\u201d says Bridget Maehr, an analyst for A.M. Best, an insurance rating service.\nHumana\u2019s game plan centered on the options the MMA gave seniors for obtaining their benefits. They could keep traditional Medicare, in which the government provides the benefits, and buy a \u201cstand-alone\u201d drug benefit; or they could get the new drug coverage plus regular Medicare benefits provided by one of the Medicare Advantage plans, which include HMOs, the less restrictive preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and private fee-for-service plans, which usually offer traditional Medicare benefits, drug coverage and benefits for extras like dental, vision and chiropractic care. There are no limits on specialist referrals, and seniors can choose any doctor who accepts the insurer\u2019s fee schedule.\nSome Medicare Advantage plans were not new. Medicare HMOs had been around since the 1970s. But by the late 1990s, conservatives had seized on HMOs, as well as new options such as medical savings accounts and PPOs, as ways to speed up privatization. Under the guise of \u201cconsumer choice,\u201d always a popular concept, Congress authorized four new kinds of plans, in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, that would compete with traditional Medicare.\nIn theory, private plans, particularly managed care, would reduce the program\u2019s escalating costs. Government payments, it was argued, would allow these plans to offer both standard and extra benefits and encourage efficient, low-cost care. However, after 2003 the government began shoveling huge sums of money into the Medicare Advantage plans to entice seniors to leave the traditional program\u2013"}

(AP) \u2014 Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels announced their $426.5 million, 12-year contract on Wednesday night, a record deal that ties baseball\u2019s top player to the Orange County club for what likely will be the rest of his career.\nTrout also thanked Angels owner Arte Moreno, who avoided two seasons of uncertainty over his superstar center fielder\u2019s future by shattering the record for the biggest financial commitment to a player in North American team sports history.\nTrout had never shown any public interest in leaving the Angels, who drafted him late in the first round in 2009 and fostered his development. But his lifelong ties to the Philadelphia area and the Angels\u2019 on-field struggles provided ample fodder for fans wondering whether Trout would leave after his contract expired.\nThe Angels have made the playoffs just once in Trout\u2019s seven full big league seasons, which coincide with Albert Pujols\u2019 seven-year tenure with the Halos. They were swept by Kansas City in that Division Series in 2014.\nLos Angeles also is coming off three consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1992-94, but the Angels\u2019 progress under general manager Billy Eppler was enough to persuade Trout to take the deal.\nThe Angels now have two impressive cornerstones in place with Trout and AL Rookie of the Year Shohei Ohtani, who will return as their designated hitter at some point this season.

Sanders, the vice president of the National Association of Independent Schools, which represents most of the nation's leading independent day and boarding schools.\nThe N.A.I.S. has previously supported school choice generally, but has shied away from the more contentious idea of allowing the government to give money to parents who enroll their children in private schools.\nThe choice amendment introduced by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, \"seems like a proper experimental vehicle\" because it would provide aid to low-income families to send their children to private schools, Mr. Sanders said before the Senate took its vote late last week.\nTwenty nonprofit religious and education groups formed the National Coalition for Improvement and Reform of American Education this month to support the private school choice amendment to S 2.\nThe groups represent virtually all segments of private education, including independent, military, Montessori, Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran, Episcopal, Seventh Day Adventist, Quaker, and evangelical Christian schools.\n\"We feel the coalition allows us to show the diversity of support among ,the private-school associations,\" said Joyce McCray, the executive director of the Council for American Private Education, the umbrella organization representing most of the private-school groups.\nDespite the defeat of the choice amendment, the coalition will stay in place for now to promote other private-school choice proposals, said Greg Kubiak, the government affairs director for CAPE.\nThe potential political impact of the new coalition was underscored last week when several private-education leaders were called to the White House to meet with key Administration officials, just as the Senate was beginning debate on the education-reform bill.\nRepresentatives of the coalition met on Jan. 21 with, among other Administration officials, Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff; Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander; and Roger Porter, the President's domestic-policy chief.\n\"This was a fairly straightforward meeting to clear up any questions we had about details in the proposal,\" said Mr. Sanders of the N.A.I.S., who attended. \"We wanted to know how seriously committed the Administration was\" to the private school choice demonstration project.\n\"There is no point to having the private-school community go out on a limb if we are not getting support\" from the Administration, he added.\nThe coalition has sent a letter and position paper to each senator this month that seek to answer criticisms that have been leveled against the idea of federally funded private-school choice.\n\"If there is anywhere in which the public system is failing and the private schools are succeeding, it is in the highly concentrated low-income communities,\" the position paper says in support of the proposed demonstration program, which would provide a total of $30 million for up to six projects in which low-income families would get certificates to send their children to private schools.\nIn addition to CAPE and the N.A.I.S., the coalition includes"}

It reminded us that courage, ambition and hope are what\u2019s needed and what have been missing from our politics, too often, for too long.\nWe have learned to tread carefully and wear our values lightly. But in recent weeks we have remembered that our convictions can, as Jonathan Freedland once wrote, \u201cbring hope flickering back to life\u201d and meet the growing appetite for a politics that doesn\u2019t simply rail against what is but aspires to build a world that is better.\nBut consider this too. The Tories ran a terrible campaign. It was, without any doubt, the most inept, counter-productive campaign I\u2019ve ever seen in British politics. The day their manifesto hit the headlines, even in our toughest neighbourhoods, we could feel change in the air.\nArrogance is never rewarded by the British people, and Theresa May has paid a price for it. Yet, despite a Tory manifesto that was a full, square attack on older people, the majority of over-65s still came out for the Tories.\nAnd despite the growing relevance of freedom, internationalism and tolerance in an era characterised by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Liberal Democrats managed to become bystanders in the political debate.\nThey stood on a platform that aimed to capture the support of those Remain voters for whom Brexit is the major question, but neglected the rest. And they quite spectacularly failed to foresee that those who were intensely angered by May\u2019s conversion to a little England, hard Brexit stance would vote tactically against the Tories. Over those seven weeks, they all but disappeared as a political force.\nAs Bob Dylan once said, \"the times, they are a-changin\" \u2013 and they will change again. The recent past has moved at extraordinary speed. The Brexit Referendum, the rise and retreat of nationalism, the election of Trump and his crushing unpopularity just a few months later, the reversal in fortunes for May and Jeremy Corbyn, the astonishing phenomenon of Emmanuel Macron and pro-European centrism, and the dramatic rise and sudden collapse of Ukip.\nPolitics, as John Harris wrote last week, is now more fluid than ever. So now is the time, for hope yes, and for conviction too, but not for jubilation. We need some serious thinking.\nWe should be cautious to rush to judgment. It is only two weeks since the exit poll sent shockwaves across the country. There is no comprehensive explanation for the multitude of motivations that delivered this election result and will not be for some time. But there are some early indictors that must make us think.\nAfter seven years of austerity, as John Curtice observes, the Tories made some of their biggest gains in some of the poorest areas of Britain. It is something I felt in all of the eight constituencies I campaigned in during the election. While the Labour vote rose significantly in towns like Wigan, so too did the Tory vote, despite little or no campaigning activity on the ground.\nAs Rob Ford puts it:"}

The Leafs were second overall in the Eastern Conference with 67 points when the contest began, Ottawa dead last with 43. It didn\u2019t matter much in this game of swings: a 1-0 Toronto lead, 2-1 Ottawa lead, 4-2 Leaf lead, 4-4 tie, then a 5-4 Leaf victory.\nAll lines were clicking, with William Nylander showing off his skills early, mesmerizing Ottawa defenders. Ditto Nazem Kadri, who has sprung to life as a puck controller even if the scoresheet has not been kind to him. The addition of Muzzin has fortified the blue line, also helping the Leafs turn the corner and start stringing wins together.\nFor the Leafs: Hyman opened the scoring, tipping in a pass from Mitch Marner, as the Leafs dominated the first 10 minutes of the first period. After they scored on their seventh shot compared to just one by Ottawa, they seemed to take their foot off the pedal. The first ended with shots even at 11 each.

Us too. Despite how perfect they may seem\u2014looking at you, Heidi and Seal\u2014a celebrity break up has a way of jolting the public like little else.\nTo gain some much-needed insight on the subject, we turned to our own YourTango experts for the inside track on exactly why celebrity couples split so frequently.\nIt happens all the time: that moment when life imitates art and two celebrities start a romance off set. But Licensed Professional Counselor Kim Olver warns that those relationships start on pretty shakey ground and may not have a great chance at survival because \"when you're acting, it can be very hard to pull up those feelings and emotions on camera without having it confused in real life. Actors engage their feelings, their thoughts and their physiology in a role and that blurs the lines between acting and reality, so you're not really clear if you love that person or not.\"\nRelationships between two people with a wide age difference in general are more difficult, says Olver. The age difference can contribute to a number of insecurities in the relationship. For example, Olver says that the older person may worry about keeping the attention of their younger mate. While on the surface these relationships may end due to infidelity (or at least strong rumors of it, hey there Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher), the root cause of the problem is likely the age difference.\nEver notice how the tabloids report that a relationship is on the rocks, the couple discounts those rumors, then they break it off a few months later? Chances are that\u2014while those rumors may have initially been false\u2014according to Olver, if the relationship isn't solid to begin with \"you may look to outside sources to fill you in. And if you believe those sources and that's the only thing you're able to stand on in your relationship, then that can wreak havoc.\" Once a celebrity lets the tabloid gossip get under their skin, it creates distrust and when that happens, Olver says the relationship tends to crumble.\nWhen anyone\u2014famous or not\u2014finds out about an affair, chances are good the relationship is about to end. In the same way that intense scrutiny from the media can cause distrust in a relaitonship, San Francisco Couples Therapist Julia Flood says that \"people tend to break up when that sense of safety is lost.\" There are rare cases where infidelity didn't lead to the end of a relationship (David and Victoria Beckham weathered rumors of infidelity in 2004 and are still together), but for that to happen the couple has to have a very healthy relationship.\nIt's natural that two famous people will have busy schedules or far-flung filming locations that keep them from being together day and night. It comes with the territory. But unless the couple has a way of staying in touch, both physically and emotionally, dealing with long periods of separation can be taxing on a couple. And for celebrity couples, the intense scrutiny and media pressure certainly doesn't help. Olver says that time apart is especially hard on the physical and sexual part of a relationship more than anything else and that \"cheating becomes a common occurrence\" for regular and celebrity couples alike.\nWhile this may not be a clear indicator of a relationship's future success or demise, it could point to the reason why a couple did split"}

Unfortunately, the popular tourist attraction collapsed in 2005 for unknown reasons but remains well-visited. The nearby Baby Bridge has assumed the mantle of Aruba\u2019s greatest standing natural bridge, a phenomenon created by the surf pounding holes through the limestone, with others dotted along the coast in harder to reach areas.\nSpectacular caves permeate the limestone rock base of the windward coast. The Guadirikiri Cave extends for 100 feet and divides into two main dome-shaped chambers that receive shafts of sunlight through holes on the surface. Entrance is through the base of a cliff. At the Fontein Cave, ancient Arawak Indian paintings adorn many of the rock surfaces, and rainwater seeping through the limestone has left many colorful deposits and formations. The Huliba Cave has a 300-foot passageway accessible with use of a flashlight and has been dubbed \u201cThe Tunnel of Love\u201d because of its heart-shaped entrance through a steep, narrow stairway.\nThe north coast\u2019s distinctive features are the numerous \u201cbocas\u201d or bays where dry riverbeds meet the ocean.

{"idx": "10922", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Few people have made an impact on the world like renowned linguist, Noam Chomsky. Chomsky revolutionized the field of linguistics with his cognitive theory that language was an innate faculty genetically defined in the human brain. The M.I.T professor holds the title of being the most cited living person, and is sometimes said to be to linguistics what Einstein was to Physics. However, linguistics aside, Chomsky\u2019s intellectual contribution is extensive. He \u201chas published over seventy books and over a thousand articles in the fields of linguistics, philosophy, history, politics, cognitive sciences and psychology\u201d (Rudolph).\nChomsky, a libertarian socialist, has attained cult-figure status in the political arena with his outspoken political activism, and biting criticism of the U.S. capitalist machine. His basic argument is that true capitalism does not exist in reality. According to him, capitalism in the United States is a fa\u00e7ade intentionally created by the power structure in order to subjugate the masses, in the interest of the rich and powerful. He applies this view to issues such as U.S. foreign policy, traditional politics, and the role of media to reveal that hidden under layers of propaganda and political rhetoric are intentions that benefit the rich by manipulating the poor, working class.\nIn a 1994 article entitled How free is the Free Market, Chomsky states, \u201cthe free market is 'socialism' for the rich: the public pays the costs and the rich get the benefit --markets for the poor and plenty of state protection for the rich.\u201d His meaning is that the market claims to be free in order to gain the trust and tax funds of the working class, but in actuality, control of the market is enormously swayed in favor of the rich and privileged. Power is concentrated into unaccountable institutions that are highly subsidized and protected by the government in the interest of the rich elite.\nChomsky begins by demonstrating his theory through a human rights perspective. Human rights are frequently an issue brought up by the U.S. when legitimizing its reasons for foreign intervention in backwards, third world countries. The1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states the universal right of everyone to a standard of living adequate for himself and his family, if often used as a leverage to support U.S. foreign opinion. However, Chomsky questions, \u201cHow are these principles upheld in the richest country in the world, with absolutely unparalleled advantages and no excuses for not completely satisfying them?\u201d He states that in New York City, 40% of children live below the poverty line. In fact, according to Chomsky, the U.S. has the worst poverty record in the industrialized world--twice as high as England\u2019s.\nTrade in the U.S. is another excellent example for the argument against the supposedly free market. Chomsky questions the true efficiency of trade. He argues that in practice, trade is \u201chighly subsidized with huge market-distorting factors\u201d that are not accounted for. Chomsky provides transportation as an example of a market-distorting factor. He writes, \u201cSince trade naturally requires transport, the costs of transport enter into the calculation of the efficiency of trade.\u201d He explains that since all forms of transportation are highly subsidized through energy-cost manipulation or other methods, the true costs of transport are greatly reduced.\nAdditionally, Chomsky describes how trade is indirectly subsidized. A substantial part of the Pentagon is directed towards maintaining intervention forces in the Middle East. Chomsky argues that the reason behind U.S. interest is primarily \u201cto"}

{"idx": "10924", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In Colorado 150 years ago wildlife faced a dire future.\nTo provide food for miners and settlers streaming west during the gold rush and land rush of the mid- and late-1800s, market hunters slaughtered deer, elk, bear, buffalo, bighorns, pronghorn and any type of bird that could provide meat. Fish fared no better as nets and even dynamite were set in rivers and streams. Polluted water flowing from mining operations also devastated hundreds of miles of rivers and streams.\nColorado's wildlife was decimated and many people thought some species were gone forever. Fortunately, farsighted conservationists and hunters decided that strong action was needed to assure survival of wildlife in Colorado.\nIn 1870, the Colorado Territorial legislature passed the first wildlife protection law: It banned the use of nets for taking fish. In 1879, the first wildlife protection agency was established. With a law-enforcement agency in place, the legislature was able to set seasons and bag limits for most species. Some of the most far-reaching laws included bans on hunting pronghorn and bighorn sheep. The bans remained in effect for more than 50 years.\nThe efforts paid off. Today, Colorado is renowned for its wildlife. Hunters come from throughout the country to hunt geese, turkeys, deer, elk, pheasants, pronghorn, bears and mountain lions. Rivers and streams attract anglers from around the world. Birders travel to Colorado to watch the mating dance of sage grouse, the stop-over of sandhill cranes in valleys throughout Colorado, and to look for the hundreds of bird species that live on the eastern plains. Other wildlife watchers hope for a glimpse of big game animals, bats, the elusive lynx or the solitary moose.\nMany of the early wildlife conservationists also were hunters, so much of the early effort to restore wildlife focused on game species. By the 1950s, Colorado's deer and elk herds were healthy; hunting for pronghorn and bighorn sheep was opened. Fishing improved as rivers and streams were cleaned up and as hatchery techniques improved.\nStarting in the late 1960s, scientists and the public recognized that the health of wildlife provided an indication of the overall health of the environment. Biologists began to study various habitats to determine the importance of vegetation and landscapes to wildlife.\nBy the 1970s, the agency, formerly known as the Colorado Division of Wildlife, was no longer just a \"hook and bullet\" outfit. The agency broadened its role to become the caretaker for all wildlife species in Colorado. Biologists were employed to learn about non-game species and the habitats that supported them. They also started looking at endangered and threatened species and how those animals could be restored or reintroduced.\nOne of the most important efforts brought the peregrine falcon back from the brink of extinction. Starting in 1978, the wildlife agency joined other agencies across the nation in an effort to save the peregrines. Because of DDT use, eggs were brittle. When a falcon sat down to incubate, the eggs would crack and the embryos would perish. With that knowledge, wildlife biologists found peregrine nesting sites and went to them when the mother was out hunting. \"Dummy\" eggs were placed in the nests and the real eggs were taken to a laboratory where they were hatched in captivity. After the chicks were born they were placed back"}

{"idx": "10931", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Retirement is looming closer and closer. During your thirties and forties retirement was probably somewhere in your mind, but you may not have focused on it as much as you should have. Now that your 50\u2019s have crept up it is the time to get serious about retirement savings.\nIf you are unsure of how prepared you are for retirement there are online retirement savings calculators that can help you see where you stand. You can enter the age you hope to retire, your current age and other factors that help determine the calculations. You will find several calculators on the Internet but a few popular versions are on aarp.org and bankrate.com.\nWhen you figure out what your savings rate should be for a comfortable retirement you can begin to set goals to make this possible.\nFirst, you want to make sure that you are participating in your employers 401 (k) programs, if available. Some employers also match a 401 (k) up to a certain amount and it is advised to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match.\nFor example, \u201dan employer may offer to match 50% of employee contributions up to 5% of your salary. That means if you earn $50,000 a year and contribute $2,500 to your retirement plan, your employer would kick in another $1,250. It\u2019s essentially free money. Don\u2019t leave it on the table,\u201d explained Debra Greenberg, director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in an article on the Merrill Edge website.\nIt is also recommended to increase your 401 (k) contribution percentage anytime you receive a pay raise.\nThere are also Individual Retirement Account (IRA) plans that are not sponsored through an employer. You can also have an IRA in addition to the 401 (k). Some of these funds are tax deductible.\nUsually, if you are under 50, there are limits on how much you can contribute to IRAs and 401 (k) plans. However, once you reach 50 you may be able to contribute more than the original limits as \u2018catch-up\u2019 contributions.\n\u201cIf over the years, you haven\u2019t been able to save as much as you would have liked, catch-up contributions can help boost your retirement savings,\u201d stated the Merrill Edge website.\nOutside of investing, you can also make goals and adjustments in your everyday spending to help meet your retirement goals. Once you see how much money you need to save you can make a plan on how to save extra funds.\nExtra savings can also come from tax refunds and bonuses from your job. As tempting as it may be to use these funds for a fun splurge, setting some of this money aside for retirement can give you piece of mind that you are headed in the right direction.\nThe longer you wait to cash out on your Social Security retirement plan the higher your monthly payment will be. Social Security eligibility begins at age 62. However, each year you delay your benefits after 62, and up to age70, will increase your benefit."}

But sure enough, the day has come.\nWho would have ever guessed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Big Blue would someday forge a strategic partnership to build a solution for millions of people? But sure enough, it just happened. Overnight, Apple just acquired a massive ally.\nEquipped with its 15,000 analytics consultants, 4,000 analytics patents, 6,000 industry solution business partners, and 400 mathematicians, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has forged a partnership with Apple to \"transform enterprise mobility.\" The implications for both companies are huge.\nThe intention in this new partnership is to take the strengths of both companies to offer an unparalleled mobile enterprise solution. The partnership is packed with substance. Consider some of these key initiatives to the new partnership.\nTapping into Apple's iPhone and iPad, IBM is developing \"a new class of more than 100 industry-specific enterprise solutions including native apps, developed exclusively from the ground up, for iPhone and iPad.\" The partnership will also introduce iOS optimized IBM cloud solutions, an enterprise-specific AppleCare service, and a new system that makes it easier for IBM to activate, supply, and manage iOS devices for enterprise clients.\nFor IBM, the biggest advantage in this partnership is in going all out on the solution that Fortune companies were already using for mobile needs. Of the Fortune 500, 98% are already using iOS in their business. Ninety two percent of the Global 500 use iOS devices. Building a better enterprise mobile solution customized for iOS devices, therefore, will give IBM a distinct advantage over its corporate analytic solutions competitors by tapping into Apple's unprecedented and growing mobile enterprise user base.\nApple gains two major advantages.\nFirst and foremost, this gives Apple an advantage over Google's Android and other mobile operating systems as an enterprise solution for large companies. IBM is a leader in enterprise analytics, cloud, software, and services -- the best ally Apple could have in its efforts to building enterprise solutions. Together, the two companies will be able to offer a more complete solution than competing mobile operating systems.\nSecond, Apple has just tapped into key distribution for its iPhone and iPads, the tech giant's two largest segments. Perhaps the most important line in Apple's press release announcing the deal was this: \"As part of the exclusive IBM MobileFirst for iOS agreement, IBM will also sell iPhones and iPads with the industry-specific solutions to business clients worldwide.\" IBM will be able to sell, activate, and supply iOS devices directly to clients. Given the scale of IBM's reach in the corporate world, this is among the largest iOS device distribution channel Apple has ever tapped into.\nBest of all, the advantages gained for both companies have more than near-term implications. IBM will be able to better meet the needs of its business clients and deepen relationships with them by finally tapping into the mobile operating system the enterprise world has became so attached to: iOS. Apple will become more entrenched in the corporate environment where the switching costs related to jumping from one OS to another are high."}

It was a late entry in the company's 200 series of small tractors, and it was the smallest of the late-80s 200 series machines. A bit underpowered and overweight by current standards, the 240 was nonetheless capable of performing a full range of landscaping, gardening and utilitarian tasks.\nThe 240 tractor is equipped with an air-cooled, single-cylinder, 422-cc Kawasaki FC420V engine that produces 14 horsepower. The engine is mated to a Tuff Torq transmission with six forward gears and one reverse gear. The 240 also features electric start and a large 3-gallon fuel tank. In comparison to 2014 Deere tractor models, the 240 is a small garden tractor; the D105 lawn tractor is the smallest riding mower in Deere's current product line, and it's equipped with a 17.5-horsepower, 500-cc engine and an automatic transmission. Despite its relatively small engine, the 240 is heavy, weighing in at 590 pounds compared to the D105's 415-pound base weight.\nThe 240 could be outfitted with either a 38-inch or 46-inch mid-mounted mower deck. The 38-inch deck features two blades, a manual lift mechanism and adjustable cutting height between 1.5 and 4 inches. The 46-inch deck has three blades, manual lift and the same cutting height adjustments as the 38-inch deck. By comparison, the D105 is equipped with a 42-inch mower deck.\nThe 240 has a wheelbase of 47.9 inches, and it rides on 16-inch front tires and 23-inch rear tires. The overall width of the tractor when equipped with the 38-inch deck is 53.5 inches, and when the 46-inch deck is onboard the tractor's width is 57 inches. Compared to current models, the 240 is chunky; the D105's wheelbase is one inch longer, but its width is only 53.9 inches, and its tires are markedly smaller than those of the 240.\nDespite its modest power and size, the 240 was intended to be a capable all-around tractor for the homeowner. It could be equipped with a 42-inch, single-stage, manual-lift snow blower, as well as a 46-inch manual-lift snow plow blade and a 33-inch tiller. A 30-inch mechanical-drive tiller in John Deere's current product line is also compatible with the 240 tractor.\nGillespie, Evan. \"Description of the John Deere 240 Tractor Mower.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/description-john-deere-240-tractor-m"}
{"idx": "10935", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Union Station will become a hub for intercity bus service under an agreement scheduled to be announced Monday by John D. Porcari, deputy U.S. transportation secretary and chairman of the Union Station Redevelopment Corp.\nThe agreement with Greyhound, Bolt Bus, Megabus and Washington Deluxe will allow riders to get on and off the intercity buses in the shelter of a reconfigured bus deck in the station\u2019s garage. To put the deal into effect, the bus deck space will need to be restriped and some utilities will have to be relocated, according to a U.S. Transportation Department source familiar with the agreement. Riders should see the bus operations envisioned in the plan this fall.\nConsolidation of the District\u2019s intercity bus service is logical and should be a good deal for riders. The low-fare buses are especially popular, but they have not enjoyed a permanent, protected home. Instead, many stop on D.C. streets. Waiting riders are exposed to the weather, the locations of stops are obscure and confusing, and access to local transit is not always easy.\nThis deal also is likely to please downtown drivers who get caught up in traffic on streets where the buses stop.\nIn addition, Greyhound can move buses from its terminal at First and L streets NE, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been publicly announced. This move also will be welcomed by bus riders. The old terminal, wedged between Union Station and the New York Avenue Metrorail station, is not convenient to either.\nPutting the buses inside Union Station means riders can make easy connections with Metrorail and Metrobus, Amtrak, MARC, VRE and the D.C. Circulator buses. The garage is near the Bikestation on the west side of the terminal.\nThe deal also makes sense for the future of the District and its travelers. Union Station, nearly falling apart until its revival in the late 1980s, is on track to become even more of a focal point for transportation and community development.\nThe District government, redevelopment corporation and other public and private partners involved in Union Station operations have been looking at projects that include streetcar service on H Street NE, reconstruction of the Metrorail station, enhancements on the station\u2019s shop levels, improvements in vehicle and pedestrian circulation in front of the station, and the residential and commercial development near and over the railroad tracks.\nThe bus plan won\u2019t yield a profit for the redevelopment corporation, the source said. Initially, the bus companies will be charged an annual $30,000 fee per bus slip to cover the estimated revenue loss from the change in bus-deck operations. There also will be a 75-cent fee per bus rider to help fund the improvements on the bus deck and a nearby parking lot for the bus drivers.\nAbout 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Pentagon Metro station, I approached the south bank of escalators that lead from the mezzanine up to the bus platform. Not surprisingly, two of the three escalators were dead. However, the one operating escalator was going down. The outbound rush-hour riders struggled up the dead escalators in the 95-degree heat, as a couple of people rode down on the operating escalator.\nI have seen this before. This time, I walked back to the kiosk and asked if the direction of the operating escalator could be reversed. The agent said that if they stopped the escalator to reverse the direction, it would break.\nHave we come to this"}

In the month doctors thought she would die, she is opening a new yoga studio instead.\nEleven months ago, a doctor told Sarla Nichols she had one year to live.\nNichols had already survived breast cancer twice, but in 2016, an oncologist said the yoga instructor had Stage 4 colon cancer.\nNichols knew the steps: She got the surgery. She got the chemotherapy. Still, her cancer didn't go away. Her doctor suggested another round of radiation, but it was unlikely that it would save her life. At best, it would just help her live a little longer.\nIn June 2017, Nichols refused the radiation and stopped treatment. By November 2017, the cancer spread to her lungs.\nThen in January, Nichols went to see her surgeon. She thought the appointment would be a routine checkup and told her husband, Jimmy Lewis, that he didn't need to come along.\nThe news hit like a weight.\n\"He just looked at me and said, 'In a year you'll be dead,'\" said Nichols, 67. \"I went out into the hall and, of course, started crying.\"\nIt took almost a month for her family to digest the news.\n\"We were given a sentence,\" Lewis said. \"In that sentence was the declaration that the centerpiece of the joy in our lives was going to go away. It was awful.\"\nNichols read up on alternative healing, changed her eating, started to meditate and practice yoga and qigong, a Chinese form of exercise and breathing, every day. Then she and Lewis started traveling. They went to Santa Fe, New Mexico. They went to Branson, Missouri. They went to New York twice.\nIn August, Nichols met with a group of seven women for a 375-mile bike ride over six days in the San Juan Islands in Washington.\n\"I was with all these women who were very vital and active and in their lives, they were all business women and I started really recognizing that I was wanting to be back in the world, engaged in the world,\" Nichols said.\nAfter that bike ride, the pieces started to come together: Nichols would open a new yoga studio to replace the soon-to-close Midtown Yoga on Cooper Street near Peabody Avenue.\nOpening a yoga studio isn't new ground for Nichols.\nNichols had always been active, but her exercise of choice was running. After finding that the running was no longer enough to help her work through severe depression and anxiety, Nichols turned to yoga. That was about 30 years ago.\n\"The first couple times I went to class I ended up just sobbing,\" Nichols said.\nShe was the one to start Midtown Yoga nearly two decades ago. She and her husband own the building. She sold the business about six years ago after the stress of the administrative side of the business became overwhelming.\nIn the meantime, she taught private lessons.\nGrace Harwood, the current owner of Midtown Yoga, decided to close the studio when her lease ends at the end of the year. Harwood said she spent months looking for a new location but couldn't find one. Midtown Yoga may still reopen elsewhere if Harwood can find a studio before her business license expires in May.\nBefore Nichols committed to the new businesses, dubbed Cooper Street Yoga, she knew she would need a plan to make sure she didn't get overwhelmed with this business too.\nThat's where her husband came in.

None of these were correct, though.\nEveryone seemed puzzled as to what the answer could be. When he told us it was women, the entire class was shocked.\nAccording to Aidan White, general secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, the media is failing to fairly portray more than half of the world\u2019s population.\n\u201cBias in the portrayal of women and men in news content has a detrimental impact on the public's perception of gender roles in society,\u201d White said.\nOf course, the media is not the only place where gender discrimination is practiced. It is well known that there have been cases of females receiving lower salaries than males doing the same job. The reason always relates to capabilities, supposedly.\nAccording to the latest census data, women make 77 cents for every dollar that men make. From the workplace to sports, the military to public office, female figures are still being placed second to men in terms of credibility and opportunities.\nLaws supposedly \u201cprotect\u201d female employees from such discrimination, and maybe in a perfect world they would be enough, or not needed at all.\nSadly, these laws under the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission leave much to go unnoticed and unattended to.\nWhen I think of working females in society, the U.S. in particular, I cannot help but wonder why the number of women holding titles of prominence is so low.\nIt seems unbelievable that we are in a country that prides itself on being full of equality and opportunity, but we have yet to have a single female president.\nAre citizens still holding onto outdated, sexist traditions, or are the women to blame for not stepping up to the job?\nThe same idea applies to senators, as only a low count of 17 female senators are serving the U.S. \u2014 a number that has not significantly grown in the past few years.\nThe obvious root of gender discrimination against females is the former roles they served in society. Physical capabilities and mental capabilities are two drastically different things that were, and still are, wrongly associated.\nWhen practically all women were housewives 75 years ago, it makes sense that this progression is not yet complete. As for me, I would certainly like it to speed up a little.\nI am by no means a feminist, but this does not mean I do not believe in equality in every imaginable sense.\nIf the reason why women are still not as active in roles of authority as men is due to lack of interest or ambition, then so be it.

If I pay $50 for a bottle of wine, I am paying for the winemaker\u2019s artistry, and the same rules apply. However, when that same wine costs $150 in a restaurant, the value is harder to justify. It\u2019s the same service if I buy a bottle for $25 or one for $250. If the restaurant invests large sums in inventory, has wines not readily available, properly stores the bottles and trains the staff then a higher markup is justified.\nHowever, in many cases I\u2019ve witnessed high markups at neigborhood-type places where the staff doesn\u2019t know the wine and the meager selections are improperly stored.

And once you've done that, just tap the basketball to start the game.\nThe game isn't NBA Jam\u2014sadly\u2014but it is a fun little way to compete against your friends. Just flick your finger on your screen to get the ball in the hoop. That's it. Miss, and you'll get a random \"way to go\" emoji as a reaction to your poor shooting skills. Make the bucket, and you'll be rewarded with a happier and/or more-encouraging emoji. You'll need the encouragement, too, as the game doesn't stay easy for very long. Make more shots, and the basketball rim will start moving around. Make even more, and it'll move even faster.\nFacebook hasn't commented about the mini-game, nor has it offered up any suggestion as to future mini-games it might launch within Messenger. We're also assuming that you have to have the most recent version of Messenger installed to play the game. Some of this writer's friends have reported issues getting it to work, but they also haven't updated their app recently.

In one corner of the store, on West 105th Street, Mr. Dennis keeps what he calls his \" 'lost theaters of the Upper West Side' exhibit\" \u2014 framed photographs of movie houses long gone and all but faded from memory. They are names from a pre-video, pre-digital age, like the Riverside, the Riviera, the Arden and the Nemo.\nMr. Dennis may be a Brooklyn College graduate, but he will tell you that he \"learned English from Leo Gorcey.\" When his daughter was born seven years ago, he and his wife named her Ava. \"That's A-V-A,\" he said after seeing me write down \"Eva.\"\n\"Like Gardner, who in my mind, I named her after,\" he said.\nBut this is really about Mr. Dennis and Humphrey Bogart. Think of it as a beautiful friendship, though you might find their conversation a trifle one-sided, given that Bogart died in 1957, four years before Mr. Dennis was born.\nWhen he was 10 and living on West 103rd Street, Mr. Dennis picked up a biography of one of Hollywood's great couples, Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The boy was startled to discover that the tough-talking Bogart, born in 1899, had lived a pampered childhood on the same street, in a brownstone at No. 245. His father, Belmont DeForest Bogart, was a surgeon. His mother, the former Maud Humphrey, was an illustrator.\n\"I was amazed,\" Mr. Dennis said. \"He lived there? You don't assume that Humphrey Bogart grew up on your block.\"\nThus began his interest in one of the century's enduring screen presences. Mr. Dennis has seen nearly all of Bogart's 75 or so films. He keeps 51 of them in stock. Ask him for his favorite, and he says that choosing is hard. Inevitably, though, \"Casablanca\" makes its way to the top.\nAs time went by, Mr. Dennis became increasingly convinced that Bogart's Upper West Side roots had to be acknowledged.\nA year ago, he began a petition drive for a plaque to be placed at No. 245, turned long ago into low-income apartments maintained by the city's Housing Authority. The petition also asked that Bogart's name go up on that stretch of West 103rd, between Broadway and West End Avenue.\nRedesignating city streets is a tricky business. Many New Yorkers don't like the idea at all, regarding it as an overdone exercise. Often, especially since 9/11, streets are named for firefighters, police officers and others who, with all respect, are best known for how they died, not how they lived.\nMr. Dennis was more interested in celebrating a life.\nWhile he didn't say so, he could have pointed out that Bogart delivered one of Hollywood's all-time great observations about New York grit when he played Rick, the world-weary cafe owner, in \"Casablanca.\" The villainous Major Strasser asks if Rick can imagine the Nazis in New York. \"Well,\""}

My friends shake their heads and ask \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Frisco, why you at are war again?\u201d Giving that some thought, I recount my first-hand experience with the Peak One process.\nAll started fine, with well-attended public meetings where citizens prioritized needs and visualized a livable, attractive neighborhood. This was developed into the Peak One Master Plan.\nThen the trouble. Early this year, the town drafted and adopted the zoning laws governing the Peak One development. In this process, a transformation occurred with the result being Peak One zoning that is way too dense!\nHow dense is it? Many envisioned an affordable and livable development like the popular Wellington neighborhood in Breck. At Peak One, there is no cap on density. Minimum lot sizes are teeny (2,000 square feet per duplex unit, 3,000 square feet per single-family home). To illustrate, assume a 50 x70-foot lot size (3,500 square feet), which is somewhat larger than the minimums. On that small lot, the zoning will allow a 1,750 square-foot home, a detached 400 square-foot garage AND an 875 square-foot carriage house living unit. In comparison, the typical lot in Wellington is 4,600 square feet, without the extra carriage house squeezed in.\nThe Peak One parcel is small, only 12.7 acres. Half is not developable acreage; we can\u2019t build on the wetlands or the flood plains, the recreation path, the roads and other public ways. On the estimated 6.4 acres of developable land, 75 homes are to be built along with a possible 75 detached carriage houses. Lacking a density cap, more than 20 units per developable acre are allowed on Peak One, far more density than in Frisco\u2019s highest allowable density district (RH) zone. Didn\u2019t we make it clear we wanted a neighborhood that Frisco could be proud of \u201d that was affordable and livable, not a development of intense density?\nThen the war begins. When citizens speak to these issues, planning commissioner Bob Bloch wrongly \u201cclarifies\u201d and pretends Peak One\u2019s density is far less. And worse, dissenters are ruthlessly attacked.\nWhere is the balance? As one who participated in the Master Plan process, I object to the direction Frisco is taking. How do we achieve a balance of our highest community priorities? Most want attainable housing balanced with other \u201chigh priority\u201d values. No park exists south of Main St. \u201d our kids play on the streets, but no park has been assured? The most used recreation path in all of Frisco runs through the parcel, why have no buffers or setbacks as yet been established? Will access to the trailhead parking for Mount Royal, Rainbow Lakes and Peaks trails be provided? Under Frisco\u2019s new legal definition of \u201copen space\u201d which counts wetlands and paved areas, will there be any contiguous or useable green areas as contemplated in the master plan?\nInstead of answers, more attacks. It is not selfish, elitist or \u201cNIMBY\u201d to question town plans. The ballot issue is not about \u201ca select few wanting to preserve their own interests\u201d. When we get name calling instead of thoughtful answers, I can only declare that Frisco is broken. I am voting YES in hopes of getting Frisco back on track.\nGail Culp lives in Frisco."}

While this may seem unusual to anyone living in the suburbs, I feel both blessed and liberated not being the family chauffeur. City living, as many working women are beginning to understand, provides much more flexibility and precious time than the suburban commuter life. While we will never have enough space for all our books (or even our clothes!) or a backyard with a swing set, our apartment is a happy clutter where no child will be forgotten in the bowels of a finished basement, and Riverside Park has plenty of grass and ball fields.

Not only have I read your Broken Windows article and value it\u2019s important impact on criminal justice policy, but its thesis goes to the heart of how we make urban areas communities again, places where we can work and live. Before we go more deeply into your crime-prevention theories and your work in the New York City subways during the 1980s, I think its important to consider the relationship between free speech and crime control. I have been struck with how political conservatives have used the issue of crime to justify autocratic, if not authoritarian, policies. Street crime is not usually rampant in non-democratic regimes, whether it\u2019s the Communist Soviet Union or authoritarian Taiwan. Public order, however, has been a challenge for democracies. To what extent are we willing to suspend individual rights for the safety of the community? Do we have to tolerate police misconduct? Do we bar political demonstrations from the steps of city hall? Do we take away government contracts from groups such as Housing Works for protesting current New York City AIDS policy? All of these have been policies of Mayor Giuliani. While all these questions do not have an obvious relationship to public safety, for the mayor of New York they are all part of keeping public order. By extension, the mayor has the right to close down an art exhibit if it offends his sense of public decency. Where does free speech end and public order begin? For Mayor Giuliani, its obvious: It all begins and ends with his own personal preferences and there\u2019s no need to worry about the democratic process.\nI know it\u2019s still early, but what do you think?"}

{"idx": "10959", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Last Saturday night, I decided to try something different, something exciting. Before I knew it, I was walking beneath a bright red portico, down a narrow flight of uneven steps and into the basement of 114 North Cayuga Street. No, I did not venture into Ithaca\u2019s newest adult entertainment store. I discovered something even more exciting: a new restaurant. Since its opening in August 2005, the aptly named Yah\u2019 Mon has brought a piece of the Caribbean into the frozen depths of upstate New York.\nFrom the moment I stepped into this cozy, inviting nook, I felt like I was miles away from the hills of Ithaca. The restaurant itself seats less than 60 people, and coupled with the bright music and colorful decor, results in an atmosphere that is both intimate and casual. Unlike many Ithaca establishments that cater to a specific crowd, Yah\u2019 Mon is a restaurant that you can take parents, friends, professors and young children to enjoy.\nThe service at Yah\u2019 Mon is quite friendly and accommodating. Admittedly, my knowledge of Caribbean food is quite limited, but my waitress didn\u2019t bat an eyelash during the battery of questions I asked about the menu: \u201cIs the chicken served on the bone? \u2013 Is the oxtail fatty? \u2013 What does goat meat taste like?\u201d I can\u2019t blame myself for asking so much. I have never seen a menu filled with so many unfamiliar dishes. The appetizers were fairly self-explanatory. Most of us have tried coconut shrimp, crab cakes, jerk shrimp and chicken wings. However, other items such as the beef patty and the cod fish with scotch bonnet had me puzzled. In the end, I ordered the crab cakes as a litmus test. The worst crab cakes I\u2019ve consumed were bready and greasy. The best crab cakes I\u2019ve tasted hailed from Maryland and melted in my mouth. The crab cakes at Yah\u2019 Mon fell somewhere in the middle, winning points for their golden brown frying technique and losing points for being filled with too much breading.\nThe list of entrees presented another conundrum. Should I stay safe and order the curry chicken, venture into the realm of Caribbean specialty and order a jerk dish, or jump off the deep end and order the oxtail stew? My dining partner chose to stay on the safe side and ordered a dish called Dunns River Falls, a combination of chicken and shrimp in red sauce over fried polenta. The chicken was blackened and crispy yet tender and juicy on the inside, and the shrimp popped at the slightest pressure. I however, decided to go wild: I ordered the curry goat. I have never tasted goat before and I must admit, I was expecting to gnaw on a lump of toughness. So imagine my surprise when a stew of tender, fall-off-the-bone meat was placed before me. The essence of goat sang on my tongue like no other meat I have tried before. Still unable to imagine the flavor? If you like lamb, you will probably like goat as well.\nI still haven\u2019t described the crowning moment of my dining experience at Yah\u2019 Mon. One thing is for sure, the chef at this restaurant has perfected the art of frying, particularly french fries. My southern palate adores sweet potato fries. I have actually gone to restaurants in Ithaca for the sole purpose of trying the sweet potato fries, and alas, I have been disappointed on several occasions. Sometimes"}

The biggest tax reform since Independence will change the indirect tax landscape of the country, subsuming over a dozen central and state taxes. GST embodies the principle of \"one nation, one tax, one market\", unifying the country's $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a common market. Despite various tax rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent, and many exceptions, the new tax regime is aimed at eliminating the cascading tax structure, easing compliances and lowering tax burden on consumers.\nTo ensure that manufacturers and service providers pass on the benefit to the final customer, the government has included an anti-profiteering clausein the GST law. Under this, it becomes mandatory to pass on the benefit tax reduction due to input tax credit to the final customer.\nThe implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation, the Reserve Bank of India said in its latest monetary policy statement. Economists also predict a benign inflation regime with global crude prices remaining soft and forecast of normal monsoon. Though the tax rates in some select services categories go up, overall inflation may not be impacted significantly, according to economists at DBS Bank, who say the overall tax burden will get lowered over time.\nThe change in service tax rate will get reflected from Day 1 of implementation. Some services will get costlier as financial services and telecom have been put in the 18 per cent rate slab under GST, from 15 per cent earlier. Education and healthcare will continue to be exempt from taxation. \"The impact of GST on service sector in the short term could be inflationary as the tax rate would immediately shoot up to 18 per cent. However, going forward, it is expected that due to reduced cost because of availability of GST credit on items hitherto not available, the price of services will come down which will benefit the consumers,\" said Sandeep Sehgal, director-tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.\nHowever, prices of many common goods at the stores are likely to remain unchanged in the initial days despite change in tax rate after the GST rollout, say experts. Manufacturers may wait for a few weeks to gauge the net impact of GST on them as well as on wholesalers and distributors and may revise the prices accordingly later, says Mr Sehgal.\nIn earlier regime, on goods having an MRP, the excise duty was paid by manufacturers on MRP based on a certain formula, says Mr Sehgal. However, in GST, there is no such concept and tax will be charged only on transaction value for all goods, he adds.\nSmall traders with annual turnover less than Rs. 20 lakh are exempt from GST registration.\nIn further relief to small businesses, under the composition scheme, they will benefit from not having to meet with detailed compliances under GST. However, they will not get the benefit of input tax credit. If businesses opt for the composition scheme, traders with turnover below Rs. 75 lakh will have to pay 1 per cent tax on turnover. Manufacturers will have to pay 2 per cent while restaurant businesses will have to pay 5 per cent."}

As his first step on the day of decision, which he went into with a small lead in the polls, he entered the Jerusalem gym from a side door with his wife Sarah to cast their votes. The masking tape markings on the floor had been worn down to nothing in some places, and hand-painted pictures by children graced the white walls. Netanyahu wore a suit and entered the room with his arm around Sarah. Each walked out of the voting booth with the sealed envelope and then paused for a moment over the ballot box so the cameras could catch them casting their vote.

A report on GDPR breach notifications rounds out the latest.\nFirst up, Instagram users are apparently the target for attackers that created a shadow database of \u201cGrammer\u201d details. Researcher Oliver Hough took to Twitter to warn of the existence of database, which is wide-open to the web. He noted that there are more than 14.5 million entries gathered through October, with information scraped from user profiles, including telephone and address data for business accounts.\nWhile the information is available on public profiles, having it all collated in one place makes like easier for criminals looking to mount a phishing campaign, for instance. And it creates a second location for user data that users themselves have no control over.\nMeanwhile, dating site OKCupid has denied a data breach after reports surfaced of users complaining that their accounts were hacked.\n@okcupid My account was just hacked about 20 minutes ago and passed/email changed, trying to find a contact email but been unable to. Any help?\nWhile password reuse and using easy-to-guess passwords often make cracking accounts like these fairly easy using credential-stuffing/brute-forcing, several users said they were using strong credentials, unique to the site. That would imply some kind of data breach or exposure by OKCupid \u2013 but that\u2019s a conclusion that it says is unwarranted.\nWe reached out to OKCupid for further comment and will update this post with any response.\nOn the international front, the European Commission said that it received 41,502 data breach notifications between May 25, 2018, when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect, and Jan. 28. The statistics cover 21 of the 28 EU member states; an analysis by law firm DLA Piper\u2019s meanwhile counted 59,430 disclosed data breaches across Europe over the same period. Most of the notifications were in the Netherlands (15,400 disclosures), Germany (12,600) and the United Kingdom (10,600). DLA Piper also said that fewer than 100 fines have been doled out so far.\nSpeaking of the UK, online parenting discussion forum Mumsnet has announced a data breach arising from a software snafu.\nThe site, which is an entrenched fixture for parents in the UK with 4.3 million unique users per month, announced that users that logged into their accounts between 2 p.m. on Feb. 5 and 9 a.m. on Feb. 7 could have had their account information switched with other users logging in at the same time.

Is there blood on the hands of those who call out crimes or on those who commit the crimes? These are questions that must be answered.\nOne of the many reasons why we at CIA find the celebration of entities like WikiLeaks to be both perplexing and deeply troubling\u2026is because while we do our best to quietly collect information on those who pose very real threats to our country, individuals such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden seek to use that information to make a name for themselves. As long as they make a splash, they care nothing about the lives they put at risk or the damage they cause to national security.\nWikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service.\n-They published the Guantanamo Bay \u2018Detainee Policies\u2019: more than 100 classified or otherwise restricted files from the United States Department of Defense covering the rules and procedures for detainees in U.S. military custody. The release of these documents led to fundamental reforms that brought the United States back within the boundaries of human rights according to the Geneva Convention. How bad would the torture have gotten without this revelation in WikiLeaks?\nThey do not care about the causes and people they claim to represent. If they did, they would focus instead on the autocratic regimes in this world that actually suppress free speech and dissent. Instead, they choose to exploit the legitimate secrets of democratic governments\u2014which has, so far, proven to be a much safer approach than provoking a tyrant\u2026No, Julian Assange and his kind are not the slightest bit interested in improving civil liberties or enhancing personal freedom. They have pretended that America\u2019s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice. They may have believed that, but they are wrong\u2026Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value. He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud\u2014a coward hiding behind a screen.\nTough words. But do they mean anything? Assange has done nothing but sacrifice his own well being and freedom for the opportunity to share unadulterated information about corporate and governmental crimes. Assange truly believes that global citizens have the inherent right to know the full truth about the world they inhabit. This truth, whether we like it or not, must come without redaction or censorship. He truly believes that every human being deserves the right to see the facts as they are, not as someone else wants them to be. What is so terrible about that? Why persecute him?\nIf Pompeo disagrees with Assange about the merits of uncensored journalism, then so be it. But to actively demean Assange\u2019s character, and to seek his head on a platter is too much. This vindictiveness was unbecoming as a Senator and it will be unbecoming as a Secretary of State. Like so many of his colleagues in Congress and the CIA, Pompeo\u2019s paranoid desire for secrecy should not be confused for patriotic foresight. The bottom line is that his stance on WikiLeaks is guilt ridden and on the wrong side of history; it is a stance that has done nothing to combat injustice, spread democracy, or preserve human rights; it has only succeeded in making the United States look hypocritical and immoral.\nGeorge Cassidy Payne is a free lance writer, adjunct professor of philosophy, and domestic violence counselor.

Catharsis was founded in 1990 and provides daily dinner to 310 elderly in need. Although the major function of the charity house is to provide food, Catharsis also offers other services like medical assistance, a relaxation room, chapel, rehabilitation hall, library and caf\u00e9.\nAccording to Elene Cucqiridze, one of the managers of Catharsis, the NGO a joint effort of government and the private sector. Around 1,000 private companies donate money to Catharsis, and more than 100 donate products and medicines on a regular basis.\nThe Georgian Government, in turn, offers the building free of rent, and supplies Catharsis with free labor in the form of the so-called \u201cbrothers of virtue,\u201d for whom the work at Catharsis is an alternative to serving in the military. Working in Catharsis is a great option compared to other alternatives used by Georgian youth to avoid military service (Read more about this in our blog \u201cOn Education and the Sacred Duty of Defending One\u2019s Motherland\u201d).\nThe way Catharsis works is similar to a public-private partnership (PPP), defined as \u201ca long-term contract between a private party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility, and remuneration is linked to performance\u201d (PPP Knowledge Lab). Although Catharsis might not fully satisfy the formal definition of a PPP, it definitely contains elements of collaboration between the public and private sectors.\nIn economic theory, public-private partnerships are typically viewed through the prism of contract theory. Back in 2003, the concept of PPP was first studied from an economic theory perspective by Oliver Hart, Professor of Economics at Harvard University, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2016. Several research studies used and expanded Hart\u2019s model (e.g., Francesconi & Muthoo 2006; Chong et al. 2007).\nPPPs typically follow the \u201cdesign-build-finance-operate\u201d (DBFO) scheme. Under this model, the government specifies the services it wants the private sector to provide. The private sector, in turn, designs the project, finances the costs of construction, and delivers the service directly to customers (the general public) or a public entity. PPPs may also be of the \u201cbuild-operate-transfer\u201d (BOT) type when the constructed asset is transferred to the government at the end of the operating contract (Hemming R., 2006).\nPPPs are attractive to both the government and private sectors. The private sector\u2019s involvement ensures greater innovation, better management and stronger incentives to decrease costs and increase efficiency. The quality of services is also usually higher when provided by the private instead of the public sector. Moreover, PPPs allow the private sector to work in new fields to which it previously did not have access. Finally, PPPs allow to combine public and private resources and skills.\nMore and more countries are adopting PPP models for a wide range of economic and social projects. PPPs are particularly common in the case of economic infrastructure projects (such as toll roads), due to high economic returns. Unlike economic infrastructure projects, social infrastructure projects (e.g. healthcare, education) have lower economic returns but higher social returns, which makes them less attractive for"}

Terry McAuliffe\u2019s (D) political action committee (PAC) to the wife of an FBI official, conservative media are trying to revive the story. Now they\u2019re trying to hype flawed, speculative allegations of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged role in the fundraising for McAuliffe\u2019s PAC in hopes of undermining the FBI\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails.\nIn an October 23 article titled \u201cClinton Ally Aided Campaign of FBI Official\u2019s Wife,\u201d the Journal reported, \u201cThe political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email use.\u201d The piece implied that the McAuliffe PAC\u2019s donation may have influenced FBI official Andrew McCabe, who is married to the donation\u2019s recipient, Jill McCabe, in his later investigation of Clinton\u2019s email use.\nBut just as the initial Journal story fell apart under scrutiny of the timeline -- Andrew McCabe didn\u2019t become involved in the FBI investigation until several months after McAuliffe\u2019s donation to Jill McCabe -- so too does the Daily Mail\u2019s bizarre and complicated suggestion that Clinton headlined a fundraiser because she was able to foresee that resulting donations would months later go to the wife of a man who would later be promoted twice to play a lead role in an investigation that did not yet exist.\nWhat hasn't been proven is that Hillary Clinton did anything improper. Clinton would have had to be a pretty advanced political chessmaster to do a June 2015 fundraiser with the knowledge that, in October 2015, it would benefit the wife of an FBI official who would be promoted to an oversight position into her email investigation the next February. And McAuliffe would have to be an even savvier operator to have recruited Jill McCabe to run for office in March 2015 in the hopes that, sometime down the line, her husband would get promoted to the point of overseeing an investigation that didn't yet exist. There's also no evidence Andrew McCabe actually influenced the email investigation in a way that benefited Clinton. For all we know, he could've been pushing for her prosecution only to be overruled by Comey.\nIndeed, perhaps a much simpler explanation for Clinton\u2019s fundraising appearance and the McAuliffe PAC\u2019s donation is that a leading Democrat raised money for the Virginia state party and the governor's PAC to try to swing the legislature to benefit the Democratic governor -- who is also an old friend -- during one of the few major off-year elections in the country.\nYet, even though almost nothing about the story has changed, right-wing media are now hyping the Daily Mail\u2019s \u201cexclusive\u201d to suggest impropriety by Clinton and McAuliffe and a compromised FBI investigation. Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson said the situation was \u201csleazy,\u201d and the pro-Trump Breitbart News suggested the donations are \u201cunusual\u201d and raise questions, despite the continued lack of evidence of any wrongdoing."}

These issues, of course, will only affect those who decide to upgrade.\nAccessory manufacturers are likely tracking the rumors of a smaller connector very closely, as a partnership with Apple, along with a timely release of product, can make or break a year\u2019s business.\nRitchie\u2019s sources have also stated that the upcoming Apple event to announce the new iPhone will be held on September 12, with a release date of September 21st. This rumor was later corroborated by Jim Dalrymple of The Loop. These sources were correct on the date of the iPad\u2019s announcement earlier this year and the site has had a recent history of publishing correct early information on Apple product releases."}

This information is fed into OpenSCAD, a program for creating solid objects, and finally churned out through his RepRap 3D printer.\nOkay, they can be on the fragile side - you don't want to risk snapping a plastic key in your lock - but Patel claims they're strong enough to turn a deadbolt, so don't close the door on the idea just yet.\nPatel even suggests the system could be used in conjunction with Sneakey, a tool for teleduplication through optical decoding. In other words, creating replicas simply from a photograph."}

The top-seeded Centaurs play No. 2 Joel Barlow-Redding (23-1) for the CIAC Class L championship at 1 p.m. at East Haven High.\nAfter losing its first game to Masuk in a proverbial wakeup call in the Class L second round, Woodstock hasn\u2019t dropped a game in its run to the final. The Centaurs handled Bristol Eastern, 3-0, with relative comfort, winning 25-18, 25-14 and 27-25. The state-tournament wins have been relatively stress-free, 75-minute or under contests.\nWoodstock has thrived by excelling in basic fundamentals.\nStrong servicing has produced easy points through aces or unreturnable shots. Reliable digging has contained opponent kill shots. Accurate feeds from Rebekha Wesler, Orlowski, and libero Maddie Gronski have fed Hernandez, a terminator outside hitter whose kills are powerful and on a downward plane. Effective defensive blocking at the net also stifles opposing offenses.\nKatherine Papp, Natalie Low and Hernandez lead the block party at the net. In the semis, they neutralized Bristol Eastern\u2019s top hitter, Zoe Lowe, until Zoe\u2019s third-game flurry of kills came up a bit short and was too late for the Lancers.\nSaturday, Woodstock will face something different - a two-headed monster, or monster and sidekick, at the net. Joel Barlow features a top outside hitter in Kiara Robichaud and another strong hitter in Julia Mullin.\nEach had 19 kills in Joel Barlow\u2019s 3-0 semifinal win over RHAM Wednesday.\nWoodstock beat Barlow, 3-0, in the 2017 Class L semifinals by scores of 25-21, 25-20 and 25-23. This year, Barlow has lost only to Class LL Newtown, 3-2, in its regular- season finale. Barlow ousted defending champ RHAM in the semifinals, 3-0.\nWhile falling one game short is Woodstock\u2019s movitation, Barlow is fueled by revenge of last year\u2019s loss. Robichaud is a four-year player and considered the best player in school history. She has been credited with 700 career kills \u2014 21 a game.\nWhile Robichaud projects to play volleyball in college, Mullin is a three-sport athlete who focuses on the sport in the fall."}

{"idx": "10998", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY, Pa. -- For decades, rifle deer hunting season has started the Monday after Thanksgiving, but now, it's one step closer to starting two days earlier.\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission tentatively approved the change at a meeting Tuesday morning. Commissioners believe opening the season on a Saturday better fits the schedules of young hunters who work or go to school.\n\"I'd like to see it start on Saturday. It gives me an extra day to hunt,\" said Richard Seidel of Danville.\n\"I think it would certainly help the younger generation get interested,\" Steven Shepperson said.\n\"The kids will get an extra day to hunt. Saturday will be an extra day. Monday would be a day off school, but maybe they'll cancel that because of Saturday being the first day,\" said Charlie Tobias.\nRichard Seidel thinks it will be nice for the hunters who cannot take off work.\n\"Certain jobs they have to work Mondays, so Saturdays would give them, then, a chance to get out there the first day. That's important because once the deer get spooked, it's a little harder to get one.\"\nEven though most of the people we spoke with agree with switching opening day to Saturday, they do see both sides.\n\"I mean it's always been the tradition, the Monday after Thanksgiving. Most schools give off at least the first day,\" Shepperson said.\n\"It was OK the way it was, but like I said, with that extra day, that does make it nice,\" Tobias added.\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission will make its final vote in April."}
