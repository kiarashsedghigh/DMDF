A second Broadway production in 2009 flopped, darkening prospects of redemption for a musical of daunting scope and undeniable skill. But there\u2019s good news to report from Pasadena Playhouse, where a stunning revival opened Sunday under the expert direction of David Lee.\nThe musical still has its embarrassing storytelling moments, and when the waves of honky-tonk piano give way to saccharine power ballads, the score loses its rich historical flavor.

If the diplomats fail again, the next confrontation will be far worse.\nIsrael's deference to Egyptian sensitivities enabled Hamas to build up its military strength. If the diplomats fail again, the next confrontation will be far worse. In late December 2007, at a meeting with a very senior Israeli defense official, The Jerusalem Post was told about a videotape, compiled by the security establishment, which documented Egypt's failure to effectively seal its border with Gaza. The tape, the Post was told, featured evidence of Egyptian assistance in arms smuggling and included footage of Egyptian security personnel aiding Hamas terrorists crossing illegally into Gaza. At one point, Egyptian border policemen were seen helping a group of some 80 Hamas personnel slip into the Strip through a hole cut in the border fence. The Post was told that the tape was being sent to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, and we reported this. The security establishment's intention and expectation was that the tape would be made available on Capitol Hill. The aim was to encourage Congress to use the leverage of US financial aid to Egypt to press for more effective controls. In the previous four months alone, according to information then compiled by the IDF, more than 100 tons of explosives had been smuggled into the Strip, as well as 20,000 rifles, 6,000 anti-tank missiles and immense supplies of ammunition. Only days earlier, Israel had also filed an official complaint with Cairo for unilaterally opening the Rafah crossing - ostensibly for Palestinians travelling to the Haj. In fact, Israel charged, this freedom of access was abused by a significant number of Hamas personnel to travel to Lebanon and Iran for military training. Egypt ridiculed the IDF's arms smuggling figures. \"To get those quantities [of weaponry] into Gaza,\" scoffed an Egyptian official at the time, \"you would need to have a tunnel every 10 meters.\" Despite the extraordinary gravity of the arms smuggling, and despite the most senior defense echelon's profound interest in alerting US legislators to the danger in the hope of prompting economic pressure on Cairo, the security establishment's videotape was not, in fact, swiftly made available in Washington. Reading the Post's report on the tape, several US legislators contacted Israeli diplomats to ask why they hadn't received it. In response, in some cases, they were told that there was no such tape, and that the Post's story was untrue. In fact, as the Post then established, the tape was shown only to some US administration officials and not made available to Congress because Israel's political and diplomatic leaders decided it did not want to infuriate the Egyptians by distributing it more widely. A senior defense official had noted to the Post that \"if key congressmen and senators see this, then it will provide a clear picture of the situation and ensure that [part of] the [US military aid] money is withheld. When this happens, [Egypt's President Hosni] Mubarak will feel that he has no choice but to stop the smuggling.\" The political-diplomatic echelon thought differently. As we reported, \"The perception that won the day this time was that over-involvement would be seen by Cairo as an infringement of certain diplomatic 'rules' between the two countries and could lead to a major crisis.\" The US Congress was already deeply concerned by the scale of the smug"}

Goetz from Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota told Reuters Health. Goetz and colleagues previously observed that CYP2D6 is needed to convert tamoxifen into its active form.\nIn this study, the researchers investigated whether common changes in the CYP2D6 gene influenced the outcomes of 223 women treated with tamoxifen as part of their breast cancer therapy.\nWomen with a gene profile in which CYP2D6's ability to convert tamoxifen to the active form was limited were more likely to experience a recurrence of their breast cancer than were other women. The researchers also found that these \"poor metabolizers\" experienced little or no hot flashes.\n\"Although CYP2D6 (gene testing) is already commercially available, at this time we have stated that we would like our data to be confirmed before routinely recommending\" such testing, Goetz said.\nAssuming the data are confirmed, \"there would be little reason to increase the dosage of tamoxifen for CYP2D6 poor-metabolizers, because, there is no evidence that increasing tamoxifen dose will increase\" levels of the active form of the drug, Goetz explained.\nConversely, some women have a genetic profile that makes CYP2D6 even better than normal at converting tamoxifen to its active form. For these women, smaller doses of tamoxifen than usually given may be appropriate, he added.\n\"Our next goal is to look at the effect of medications that inhibit CYP2D6 on the risk of breast cancer relapse,\" Goetz said. \"This is critically important as some very common medications are frequently administered to patients while on tamoxifen to either treat depression or to alleviate tamoxifen-induced hot flashes.\""}

When Reed objected, his trustee\u2019s attorney charged even more to defend the original bills.\nBondonno\u2019s latest action strikes down a third set of fees requested by attorney Michael Desmarais, who is representing prominent Silicon Valley trustee Thomas Thorpe in this closely watched case illustrating the high cost of estate managers who serve elderly and disabled adults \u2014 and how the court did little for years to stop it.

When Reed objected to Thorpe\u2019s and his attorneys\u2019 original $108,000 bill, the costs soared.\nThe bills submitted by Thorpe\u2019s team so far amount to more than half of the money Reed has left in his trust. Reed\u2019s legal team includes a public defender and two private attorneys working free of charge.\nIn previous rulings, Bondonno struck down 80 percent of fees Thorpe charged Reed\u2019s estate, and has said he lamented awarding Thorpe\u2019s attorney more than $145,000. But he said he was hamstrung by a 1989 California Supreme Court ruling in the Estate of Trynin, which allows for so-called \u201cfees-on-fees\u201d in disputes such as these.

It\u2019s a promise to care for someone in the face of the harsh realities of life on planet Earth, from Donald Trump\u2019s views on climate change to pharmaceutical marketing to the plight of child soldiers like his new friend from Sudan, Emmanuel Jal. Since he wrote the song, Jal has become his occasional touring partner and the singer-rapper brings a guest vocal track to the song.\nHis latest single, Walk Away, from the album Storm Boy, is about finding the courage to change.\nWhile Rudd\u2019s brand new release Storm Boy takes on all those themes, in the end, its greatest value might be as a balm for the soul, a respite for anyone who\u2019s stressed out in these troubled times.\nWith its title track named after a popular Australian children\u2019s book and movie from the 1970s, Storm Boy offers some of the most comforting, heartfelt, passionate tunes Rudd has recorded yet, including a few tender love songs. After his collaboration with the United Nations band on Nanna (2015), it\u2019s also the singer\u2019s first solo project since 2012\u2019s Spirit Bird and his ninth studio album.\nStorm Boy\u2019s songcraft will likely elicit further comparisons with the likes of Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel for the singer\u2019s depth of vocal sincerity, deft pop hooks and entrancing grooves that delve into roots reggae and more. But Rudd\u2019s biggest collaborator might be Mother Nature, and it\u2019s a telling thing that the cover graphic of little white dots is actually a picture of the night sky.\nBeyond his wider planetary concerns, it sounds as if Rudd\u2019s personal life has never been better.\nHe\u2019s been based along Australia\u2019s northeast Sunshine Coast for about seven years now. Two years ago, he got married for the second time, \u201cto an amazing woman.\u201d On top of that, a bit of emergency back surgery was \u201clife-changing\u201d for the way it ended years of chronic pain and occasional canceled shows. His new titanium implant is \u201cjust great,\u201d and that\u2019s no small thing considering the energy he puts into his live performances.\nTrue to form, the Storm Boy concert tour finds Rudd handling \u201call that stuff\u201d as he puts it, a cluster of guitars, yidaki (or didgeridoo), harmonica and percussion. Backup players cover bass, keys and drums (bassist Yosef Haile and Ian Peres\u2019 keys also appear on the album with session guests).\nAt some points in the past, Rudd has been dubbed a one-man band. He seems to value the purity of expression that lone effort embodies and part of each show will still feature him all alone.\nGrowing up around Torquay, in the south Australian state of Victoria, Rudd came from a mixed British-Dutch-Aborigine ancestry, but he grew up very close to nature and spent much of his early life in the bush and along the ocean.

And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!\nAnd so, while I\u2019m hoping to run a positive campaign, I am today going to engage in some real trash talk.

Metallic balloons are particularly problematic for marine life, having a longer life-time than latex balloons, and mass balloon releases (for various ceremonies) is little different from dumping plastic bags into the oceans.

Cubed3 was lucky enough to get an early taste of this Spring 2015 release, so get plugged in and find out why this is already turning into something very special indeed.\nThe beauty of the Blackwell series was that its puzzles were inventive and really got the old grey matter working, yet never put players in that uncomfortable position of having to go through every permutation of item-person-scenery to find solutions. Currently, that breath of fresh air in the point-and-click genre has not been forgotten about with Technobabylon following suit. Nothing is overly confusing or illogical, and although getting stumped during even these early stages was something that occurred, taking a moment and using some lateral thinking suddenly made everything clear, giving a fantastic sense of satisfaction when unravelling what initially looked impossible.\nThere were two key scenarios available in this sampler, the first being a 'trapped in a box' section, focusing on Latha Sesame who has, for some reason, been locked in her room, and the second being a detective-style affair, revolving around Charlie Regis and his partner at the CEL police force, Max Lao.\nFirst up, Latha - described as \"a jobless agoraphobe addicted to the Trance\" (a sort of cyber network for online communication, sheltering people from the world). She finds herself caged within her own apartment, which might sound odd given the 'agoraphobe' tag, but when having the freedom to leave, she chooses not to, but removing that liberty brings about a whole different train of thought. Using the very limited tools around her room, a complex situation must be resolved by not merely using the objects at her disposal, but also logical thought processes and interaction with computer systems that control her food machine and door controls. Going from seemingly super easy due to the lack of options, to then almost impossible when the first attempts at escaping do not work, what is gradually revealed in this first step is how complexity can be brought into even the simplest of circumstances\u2026and how enjoyable it is to break everything down.\nWhilst grafting away, it is apparent the Adventure Game Studio development tool is at play, with the core mechanics of the Blackwell games shining through in terms of the inventory and interaction elements, as well as the retro-pixellated graphical appearance of the characters and their surroundings (with new pixel art introduced by the talented Ben Chandler, it should be added). What is not retro in style, however, is the atmospheric soundtrack that - although still not finalised - exudes a chilling air of mystery, with a foreboding Dystopian future vibe where the feeling is that humanity is fading. As well as this, there is stellar voice acting, really complementing the already strong gameplay of Technobabylon - something that also drove the Blackwell games forward.\nThe final section tested was the dour world of CEL members, Charlie - someone that has managed to avoid being connected to the all-seeing network - and his female cohort, and technophile of the partnership, Max. This duo is hot on the heels of the Mindjacker, someone stealing the contents of people's brains, but there is also something else afoot, something that raises a lot of questions at this early stage, which definitely built up the intrigue levels higher and higher the more progress was made through the initial scenes on offer.\nIntriguingly, there are even moments where key"}

Who could argue against the need for kids to meet basic standards or for schools to be held accountable for student success?\nUnfortunately, while questions can be shaped to yield answers that fit neatly into little boxes on a test sheet, children are not shaped nearly as easily.\nOr, as my late schoolteacher grandmother put it, \"Every child learns differently.\"\nRight you were, Grandma. I learned that quickly enough when my son, now 11, was falling behind his peers in his reading scores in the second grade, much to the alarm of his mother and I.\nFortunately, filmmaker George Lucas re-released \"Star Wars\" at about that time. My son, like innumerable children before him, was hooked. Big time.\n\"Dad? Would you buy me a book?\"\nSoon my kid immersed himself in many \"Star Wars\" books. Within three weeks, his teacher remarked that he suddenly had lurched from performing below his grade level in reading to well ahead. She wanted to know why.\n\"Thank George Lucas,\" I said.\nMy son, it turned out, knew how to read. He simply had not been handed anything that he really felt like reading.\nWith that, I received a simple but dramatic example of how children who seem to be foundering educationally can blossom suddenly when something clicks inside them.\nThe greatest gift a teacher can give is to inspire a desire to learn. Instead, teachers and principals increasingly are pressured to drill kids in ways to pass standardized tests.\nUnfortunately, left to spend their limited resources on meeting new state or federal standards, school districts are bound to take the cheapest and easiest course. That often means they increasingly will make the tests not only the main measure but the only measure of a child's educational progress.\nThat one-size-fits-all approach to education poses a problem that can only become worse when such tests are given annually.\nThe Bush administration is right to call for more accountability for low-performing schools. But many leaders in the educational and psychological-testing community caution that such tests should not be the sole or even the primary basis for high-stakes decisions that lead to promotions, graduation or college acceptance.\nYet the Bush administration is wedded to quite the opposite idea, that annual testing is not only helpful but essential to educational progress.\nAnd, if you don't agree, Education Secretary Paige says you're some sort of snooty elitist who wants to keep kids trapped in a \"broken system.\"\nThat's what Mr. Paige declared in a Mother's Day essay in the Washington Post: \"Anyone who opposes annual testing of children is an apologist for a broken system of education that dismisses certain children and classes of children as unteachable.\"\nComing from a man known for his even-handedness, Mr. Paige's remarks take a surprisingly intemperate slap. In fact, opponents to annual school testing include many people who live and work with students in a variety of neighborhoods, from the most affluent to the most disadvantaged.\nThey include parents in wealthy suburbs like Scarsdale,"}

Several years ago, LaRue, the Port of Corpus Christi's executive director, began seeing the smooth quartz grains arriving in bulk from Wisconsin and Minnesota. It's used in fracking, one of the materials injected into shale-rock formations to free oil and natural gas and coax it topside.\nNone of that fracking is happening in this industrial port city down the Gulf Coast from Houston. Instead, Corpus Christi is the waypoint for the sand that's trucked inland to the surging Eagle Ford Shale formation.\nThe inland energy boom is sending more than sand through the nation's fifth-largest port. On a recent May morning, not far from from an airline-hangar-sized building filled with fracking sand, long rows of steel drilling pipe from Korea awaited shipment to Eagle Ford sites.\nBut what's now coming from the Eagle Ford back into and through Corpus Christi is transforming the region even more. The trickle of crude oil flowing from the port has turned to a flood: Between 2010 and 2011, the port went from exporting 274,000 barrels to more than 2 million. Last year, the number of crude barrels headed outbound to other parts of the U.S. was 122.5 million and the port has expanded its docks to handle it all.\nBillions of dollars in investment is pouring into the region. Unemployment in Corpus Christi is down, and it was 5.1 percent in March compared with 6.3 percent nationwide. More jobs are on the way. Beyond the crude oil exports, companies are planning new manufacturing and chemical plants that will use Eagle Ford's natural gas.\nAsked how much of the port's recent expansion can be chalked up to the Eagle Ford, LaRue replied, \"I don't want to say 100 percent.\" He adds: \"I'd say 90 percent.\"\nIn sum, Corpus Christi is riding the fracking boom without doing any fracking of its own.\nBut just as the city is getting an economic jolt from Eagle Ford Shale development, new pollution sources are also arriving, creating fears of new exposure in poor and minority neighborhoods that are already shouldering more than their fair share.\nWhile there is air-pollution-monitoring in the region, activists nonetheless fear that the rapid new development will outpace anyone's ability to understand its overall impact and safeguard against dangerous air toxics.\n\"There is no process where you really get a good cumulative look at what people are being exposed to,\" said Kelly Haragan, who directs the environmental clinic at the University of Texas law school and works with Corpus Christi activists.\nThe list of new projects \u2014 and pollution sources \u2014 that are underway or planned is long.\nNew oil storage tank farms dot the port region.

The tiny fluctuations in it are just the right size to have triggered the growth of galaxies and other large-scale structures.\nMAP will measure the tiny temperature differences within the fossil light, which is in the microwave frequency. The temperature differences vary by only millionths of a degree.\nCosmologist Dr Charles Lineweaver, from the University of NSW, says MAP will have 20 times the sensitivity of COBE and can view across a greater range of frequencies.\nUnlike the various balloon-borne and ground-based experiments since COBE, which looked at only a small section of the sky, MAP will see it all.\nAbout a month after the launch, MAP will swing past the Moon, boosting its orbit to a special point four times further than the Moon in the direction away from the Sun. The point, known as Lagrange 2 or L2, requires very little fuel to maintain orbit.\nThe journey will take three months, and it will be an additional 18 months before the survey and analysis are complete."}

The Cuban-American model has managed to keep Air Jordan grounded for the last three years. This, in itself, deserves a huge bag of Kudos. So, what does Jordan do? He proposes.\nSince leaving the Bulls, Jordan has basically fallen flat in his basketball ventures. He tried turning the Washington Wizards around in the front office, making moves that no one else would make.\nHe then decided to come out of retirement to play nothing like his younger version and now Jordan is attempting to turn the Charlotte Bobcats into a contender.

It\u2019s very possible that MJ has grown up and will now take this second opportunity seriously.

The location of the proposed development adjacent to Earl Shilton\u2019s urban area and the identified infrastructure improvements would contribute towards ensuring a sustainable form of development.\n\u201cThe proposed development would result in a number of benefits to the existing and proposed population. It would contribute to social sustainability through the provision of additional homes which would increase supply and choice for the local population, provide work in Earl Shilton in construction related jobs and services and through the delivery of the proposed employment land, provide additional amenity facilities that would benefit Earl Shilton, including public realm improvements in the distinct centre and to public open space, improve road access and provide land that would facilitate the extension of Heath Lane Medical Centre."}

But some families are raising concerns about safety and sharing alarming accounts of apparent side effects in their kids.\nAn ongoing study is looking into the safety of the popular medication in response to reports that a number of children developed \u201cneuropsychiatric problems\u201d after taking MiraLAX.\nWhile the FDA awarded a grant to CHOP to investigate the possible side effects in 2014, the story is once again making headlines after a report from a local Philadelphia news station voicing parents\u2019 concerns.\nFamilies told WPVI-TV that after taking MiraLAX their children experienced mood and behavioral changes, including depression, anger, anxiety, and mood swings.\n\u201cWe saw a lot of the anger, a lot of the rage, a lot of the aggression,\u201d parent Mike Kohler told the station.\n\u201cIt was horrifying to see my daughter change like that and to not come completely go back to normal,\u201d Ward said.\nHow great a concern are such claims, and is there proof that MiraLAX is the cause of the problems?\nPediatric neurologist Dr. Jonathan Mink, MD, says that while the jury is still out, there are other likely scenarios that might explain the issues these parents reported.\n\u201cI see an awful lot of children who have neurobehavioral syndromes like Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and anxiety and constipation is a common problem in those children,\u201d he told CBS News.\nThough the exact connection is unclear, the nature of these disorders likely has something to do with it, as nerve cells and muscles also control bowel function, explained Mink, who serves on the executive committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Neurology and is president of the Child Neurology Society.\nThat raises the possibility that problems the parents observed may have been due to an underlying condition rather than the medication itself.\nIn 2014, the FDA reported 167 adverse side effects in children who had taken MiraLAX, 37 of which included neurological or psychiatric responses.\nBut after reviewing these cases, the agency said there was not enough evidence to change or add any additional warnings to the drug\u2019s label.\nMink says he believes the study will eventually help provide more concrete answers. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the study is going on to look into this because the concern has been raised,\u201d he said.\nHowever, for children with chronic constipation for which alternative treatments have not worked, Mink says he believes MiraLAX is likely safe to use.\nHe notes that although MiraLAX isn\u2019t approved by the FDA for use in children, it doesn\u2019t mean it is not safe.\n\u201cFor pediatricians and pediatric sub-specialists, there are many treatments that we offer to children who have very serious symptoms that have not been approved by the FDA for use in children.

{"idx": "24076", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For some entrepreneurs and high-net-worth individuals, the citizenship with which they were born somewhat restricts their ability to do business or invest globally. As a consequence, the last three decades have seen a growth in savvy high net worth individuals seeking alternative residence and citizenship options.\nFar removed from traditional ideas of residency and immigration, the era of globalisation has created a new class of \u2018citizen.\u2019 Economic citizenship, otherwise called citizenship by investment, is an immigrant investment opportunity. Through economic citizenship programmes, an individual is granted citizenship after completing the legal process of naturalisation and having made a financial investment in a country\u2019s economy.\nWhile economic citizenship programmes (or ECPs) exist in countries all around the world, they are very popular in the island nations of the Caribbean, where citizenship comes with a range of benefits including increased international mobility.\nIn recent years, Grenada has been making conscious efforts to encourage national economic growth by way of its economic citizenship programme. The Government intends to secure a stable economic future using such investments to support the financing of growing sectors, such as tourism and construction as well as smart energy solutions.\nOne way this is made possible is through the island\u2019s National Transformation Fund (NTF). The Government makes use of money from the NTF to transform the local economy. A donation to the NTF is one of two paths to Grenadian economic citizenship, and gives investors a true sense of having contributed to their new nation\u2019s wellbeing.\nAcross the country, there\u2019s also a tangible commitment to make Grenada an international business and investment hub, with non-restrictive trade. Economic citizenship-funded initiatives are in the rare position of being able to operate debt-free going forward, which is a major economic sustainability factor.\nEconomic citizenship is a valuable source of foreign direct investment. In St Kitts and Nevis, for example, the citizenship programme was projected to generate roughly EC$200 million Eastern Caribbean dollars in 2015, which equates to nearly a third of the Government\u2019s revenue.\nAlternative routes to economic citizenship in Grenada include making an investment towards one of the island\u2019s many approved real estate projects, including hotels, villas, and resorts. Investment in tourist infrastructure is incredibly popular, owing to the exponential growth of Grenada\u2019s tourism industry in recent years.\nPrivate investors are able to purchase real estate at such developments as the Point at Petite Calivigny, a boutique residential development on the island\u2019s blissful southern coast, and the Mount Cinnamon luxury resort and beach club.\nAs Grenada\u2019s tourism sector expands, so do the number of approved real estate development proposals, including, for example, the Kimpton Kwana Bay resort, a new 146-key resort that is expected to open in early 2019.\nThe economic citizenship programme is expected to continue to bring a considerable number of new real estate-based projects to Grenada, with a strong positive impact on the Grenadian economy and other positive spinoffs.\nThis makes for particularly fertile ground for both budding and seasoned entrepreneurs in Grenada, and widens their scope to do business internationally. It\u2019s no wonder the past few years have seen a fast-growing economy that today draws high-net-worth investors from around the globe."}

It's an idea that has taken on a life of its own; more of a life, I suspect, than what it predicts ever will. It's a Thing for techno-utopians: wealthy middle-aged men who regard the singularity as their best chance of immortality. They are Singularitarians, some seemingly prepared to go to extremes to stay alive for long enough to benefit from a benevolent super-artificial intelligence \u2013 a man-made god that grants transcendence.\nAnd it's a thing for the doomsayers, the techno-dystopians. Apocalypsarians who are equally convinced that a super-intelligent AI will have no interest in curing cancer or old age, or ending poverty, but will \u2013 malevolently or maybe just accidentally \u2013 bring about the end of human civilisation as we know it. History and Hollywood are on their side. From the Golem to Frankenstein's monster, Skynet and the Matrix, we are fascinated by the old story: man plays god and then things go horribly wrong.\nThe singularity is basically the idea that as soon as AI exceeds human intelligence, everything changes. There are two central planks to the hypothesis: one is that as soon as we succeed in building AI as smart as humans it rapidly reinvents itself to be even smarter, starting a chain reaction of smarter-AI inventing even-smarter-AI until even the smartest humans cannot possibly comprehend how it works. The other is that the future of humanity becomes in some sense out of control, from the moment of the singularity onwards.\nSo should we be worried or optimistic about the technological singularity? I think we should be a little worried \u2013 cautious and prepared may be a better way of putting it \u2013 and at the same time a little optimistic (that's the part of me that would like to live in Iain M Banks' The Culture. But I don't believe we need to be obsessively worried by a hypothesised existential risk to humanity. Why? Because, for the risk to become real, a sequence of things all need to happen, a sequence of big ifs. If we succeed in building human equivalent AI and if that AI acquires a full understanding of how it works, and if it then succeeds in improving itself to produce super-intelligent AI, and if that super-AI, accidentally or maliciously, starts to consume resources, and if we fail to pull the plug, then, yes, we may well have a problem. The risk, while not impossible, is improbable.\nBy worrying unnecessarily we're falling into a trap: the fallacy of privileging the hypothesis. And, perhaps worse, taking our eyes off other risks we should really be worrying about, such as manmade climate change or bioterrorism. Let me illustrate what I mean. Consider the possibility that we invent faster than light travel (FTL) some time in the next 100 years. Then I worry you by outlining all sorts of nightmare scenarios that might follow. At the end of it you'll be thinking: my god, never mind climate change, we need to stop all FTL research right now.\nBut there are already lots of AI systems, so surely it's just a matter of time? Yes, we do have lots of AI systems, like chess programs or automated financial transaction systems, or the software in driverless cars.

And you've probably wondered: can I maybe still work out after throwing back a few drinks?\nTo get to the bottom of this, we spoke with Aaron White, Ph.D, senior scientific advisor to the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and Thomas Allison, Ph.D, Director of the Integrated Stress Testing Center at the Minnesota Sports Cardiology Clinic.\n\"When you drink, the alcohol goes to your stomach and then is absorbed in the small intestine,\" White tells BuzzFeed Health. \"Alcohol is a small molecule that goes wherever the water goes in your body, which is everywhere, and that includes your brain.\"\nHow quickly you digest the alcohol is going to depend on what else is in your stomach \u2014 so if you haven't had anything to eat recently and your stomach is empty the alcohol can be absorbed within just half an hour.\nJust one adult beverage can affect the way your brain works.\nWhite says it can take only one drink, depending on genetics and tolerance, for your balance, decision making, and reaction time to be affected.\nThat's because alcohol targets four major parts of the brain: the reward center \u2014 which controls feelings of euphoria, making you feel good; the cerebellum \u2014 which controls motor coordination: balance, movement, and reaction time; the frontal lobe \u2014 which controls behavior, decision making, and impulse control; and the amygdala \u2014 which is what makes you feel anxious or afraid when you're in danger.\nSo, for instance, you may not be as wary of your limits when lifting heavy weight, which could lead to injury. Or, because your motor coordination is off, you could be playing a sport and accidentally hurt yourself or a teammate because your balance is off.\nFor most people, it'll take a few drinks to really feel the effects while exercising.\nAllison says that studies have shown it will take a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of around .08 for you to experience loss of muscle strength and endurance or feel lightheaded and dizzy while exercising. That can be around two to three drinks for a 140-pound person and four to five for a 160-pound person.\nBut, he points out, all those studies were done in a lab. In a real-world setting in which we're moving around outside and in a gym (with much more stimuli) it may take only a drink or two for someone to feel those effects. For instance, you'll probably feel that alcohol a lot more when you're running around outside in the sun than you would doing the same in an air-conditioned gym.\nSo clearly anything that requires concentration, balance, or technical ability is probably a don't.\nIf you\u2019re doing something simple at a moderate intensity, like bicep curls, going for a jog, or riding a stationary bike, White says you probably won't notice a difference. But if you've signed up for a CrossFit class, it's your heavy lifting day, or you're doing anything that requires you to get close to giving your maximum effort, you'll definitely feel the consequences of the alcohol.\nSo if you've had a few drinks, definitely don't try exercises or activities that involve lots of concentration, balance, or judgement calls, such as trail biking/running, yoga,"}

One thing that will surely catch your enthusiast eye is the fact that this is likely the first 80Plus Platinum rated power supply you have seen in the overclockers realm. Kingwin does mention this unit is \"overclocked\" as well. 650 watts for the price of 550 watts? Uh, no.\nToday we have the opportunity to have a look at a power supply being branded by KWI Technology Inc., or better known to most readers as Kingwin. Kingwin has been in business since 1992 manufacturing mobile racks and general storage solutions. Today though we find Kingwin branding, and in some product categories developing, a number of different components and peripherals including cases, CPU coolers, liquid cooling systems, and power supplies in addition to its core business markets. Today\u2019s Kingwin offering is from another extension of its Lazer branding; the \"Lazer Platinum.\" In particular, we will be reviewing the Lazer Platinum 550W (LZP-550) which is developed in conjunction with SuperFlower once more.\nSuperFlower Computer Inc is a name that may not be familiar to most of our US readers, but as a company SuperFlower has been designing and producing power supplies, and chassis, since 1991. In 2006, it expanded with the establishment of a new subsidiary factory, Jing Hua Co., Ltd, now handling its increased power supply production. While SuperFlower has not been a high profile OEM in the US, some of its products can be found branded by TTGI, MadDog Media, Kingwin, and occasionally under it own \"SuperFlower\" brand. One of the distinguishing points spearheaded by SuperFlower units was the inclusion of some of the first 140mm fans, and while normally not found as the OEM behind \"ultra high end brands,\" SuperFlower has typically made solid budget oriented offerings.\nThe Kingwin LZP-550 is the 4th power supply we have seen from Kingwin and is the smallest by capacity at just 550W. In addition to being the smallest capacity unit we have seen from Kingwin, the unit's Platinum branding gives us another clue on how this unit differs from other Kingwin Lazer products that we have reviewed before. This is not only the first 80Plus Platinum advertised unit we have reviewed from Kingwin, but the first 80Plus Platinum unit we have seen. To be sure though, efficiency is not the be all and end of all of a quality power supply. In addition to that obvious advertised advance, what else does Kingwin have up its sleeve with this new unit?\nThis time around we find the Lazer webpage just has a list of features and no real advertising or copy for the LZP-550. We do not consider this a bad thing either, as most of the PSU marketing it more story telling than product description. Moving on let\u2019s see what we can expect when a user purchases the Kingwin LZP-550 supply in retail in terms of documentation, accessories, cable count, rail layout, output characteristics, and general build quality."}

We idolize the sheer genius of Albert Einstein and the creative brilliance of Steve Jobs\u2014framing their success within the idea that geniuses like these are born, not created.\nWe have a surprisingly antiquated and misguided idea of how real talent comes to be, and this mistaken belief is holding our country back. There is no place where this myth is more destructive than in education.\nSince the inception of \u201cGifted and Talented\u201d programs, we have operated based on the idea that children are either born with rare and exceptional intellectual capacity, or they are not. In other words, being gifted is exactly that\u2014a gift, having little or nothing to do with a child\u2019s effort and everything to do with his or her natural ability.\nThis pushes parents of bright young children to become hyper focused on proving their child\u2019s giftedness at a young age. And for good reason: the gifted label is a golden ticket in our education system. Once a child has earned it, typically by claiming a spot in the top 10 percent in a given skill or subject area, most often based on standardized test scores, the doors to gifted and talented education programs and resources swing open. These programs offer the accelerated curricula and greater learning resources that propel a small subset of students into top colleges and elite careers.\nAll of this sounds fine until you consider who we\u2019re leaving out and what\u2019s at stake. We need more innovators, problem solvers, and highly skilled people to tackle the monumental challenges of the 21st century. Unfortunately, in the current education system, exceptional ability is too often an entry point, not a destination. The onus is on parents to prove that their child has extraordinary talent before they can access the most effective learning resources. But a large and growing body of research shows that this may be limiting the quality and quantity of the next generation of thinkers.\nMore than three decades of research from Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and others support the idea that when students believe they can develop their potential\u2014rather than believing it\u2019s limited by natural intelligence or ability\u2014they begin to approach difficult problems differently. Instead of seeing impossible and frustrating tasks, they see challenges that need to be sweated over and solved. Research shows that these moments of struggle with difficult tasks are critical to higher learning. These struggles build stronger, deeper neural connections and help children become more determined, resilient, and confident when facing challenges.\nIn this way, intelligence is not fixed. Intellectual capacity expands or contracts based on how we use our brains. The most advanced learners understand this, and they seek out challenges that help them expand their intellectual capacity. On the flip side, misguided belief in fixed intelligence can lead to a variety of negative learning patterns. For example, children labeled \u201cgifted\u201d early on often reach the conclusion that needing to work hard is a sign of low intelligence. They shy away from challenges, fearing that failure or struggle will expose intellectual weakness.\nSo why, then, is our entire system for gifted and talented education predicated on the notion that intelligence is a fixed trait that can be measured at a young age? Our fixation on giftedness as a threshold for access to superior education is harming our most promising children\u2014both those identified as the smartest of the smart, and those who may have been overlooked.\nIn my own life, I was very nearly a victim of this broken system. When I moved in fifth grade from Barbados to a working-class neighborhood in the suburbs of Philadelphia, my school didn\u2019t know what to make of"}

But the bills soon may be coming due for a long-ignored byproduct of that process.\nThough the air pollution produced by coal-fired plants has long been limited by rules to protect the environment, the disposal of coal ash, another potentially harmful byproduct, was virtually ignored by regulators. Coal ash contains an array of dangerous chemicals, but most plants captured the ash and flushed it into artificial holding ponds or landfills, which presumably kept the chemicals contained. Indiana, as a major industrial state with high electricity use, leads the nation in the number of coal-ash ponds.\nThough there are no fly-ash disposal sites in northeast Indiana, the coal plant operated by American Electric Power in the southern Indiana town of Rockport supplies a portion of the electricity delivered by I&M, the AEP subsidiary that serves northeast Indiana.\nGrowing concern that dangerous chemicals including arsenic, radium and boron might be seeping into groundwater and nearby drinking-water wells from those holding ponds led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue its first regulations on coal ash in 2015. Though that represented a step forward, environmental groups challenged the agency in court, contending the new rules should apply tocoal-ash disposal sites that have been closed down as well as those still operating.\nThe regulatory outlook is still murky. The Trump administration plans to delay implementation of the new rules, though that decision is also being challenged in federal court by environmental groups.\nAccording to the Indianapolis Star, two Indiana utilities, Duke Energy and NISPCO, have already filed test results indicating they have groundwater pollution violations and have offered plans for cleanup to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which is charged with enforcing the federal rules.

The proposal is set to go before the Senate by midweek. The act will be the first amendment voted on in a broader Democratic bill that will also seek to make gun trafficking a federal crime, and provide more federal funding for school security programs.\nIn March, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dropped proposals from the bill introduced by Sen.

With the thoroughness and relentlessness of a prosecutor, Power documented how US officials sat idly by as Armenians were slaughtered in Turkey, Cambodians were massacred by the Khmer Rouge, Kurds were gassed by Saddam Hussein and Bosnian Muslims were murdered by Bosnian Serbs. She extolled the work of such courageous crusaders as Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jewish immigrant who coined the term \u201cgenocide\u201d in 1944 and lobbied diligently for the passage of the UN\u2019s Genocide Convention, which was approved by the General Assembly in 1948 and ratified by the United States forty years later. Lamenting the fact that \u201cno U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority,\u201d Power assailed US officials for responding to \u201cunspeakable atrocities\u201d by trusting in negotiation, clinging to diplomatic niceties and shipping injured parties humanitarian aid. The United States, she maintained, should subject perpetrators to a harsher array of measures\u2013threatening them with prosecution, shutting their embassies in Washington, imposing economic sanctions. Genocide poses such a serious threat to American values and interests, Power argued, that the United States should be prepared \u201cto risk the lives of its soldiers\u201d in order to stop it, even if this means acting unilaterally outside the framework of the United Nations.\nThe winner of the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 2003, \u201cA Problem From Hell\u201d propelled Power from the tilling fields of freelance journalism and adjunct professorship into the empyrean realm of public intellectualdom. She was named to Time magazine\u2019s list of the world\u2019s top 100 scientists and thinkers. She became a columnist for that magazine and a regular contributor to The New Yorker.

Despite that misstep, if Obama is elected President, Power seems likely to join his administration in some senior capacity.\nYet, in the harsh glare of recent events, \u201cA Problem From Hell\u201d seems less persuasive than when it came out. Appearing as the Bush Administration was pressing its case for attacking Iraq, the book, with its advocacy of humanitarian military intervention and its description of Saddam\u2019s regime as genocidal in nature, fed support for the war in some liberal circles. Now, with more than 140,000 US troops bogged down in that country, and with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead and millions more displaced in the largest episode of forced migration in the Middle East since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the idea of relying on unilateral American military power to achieve humanitarian ends seems largely discredited.\nIn her new book, Power offers something of a response.

The World Health Organization has warned that a deadly outbreak of the plague, which began in late August, is swiftly spreading in cities across the country.\nThe unprecedented outbreak of a highly contagious form of plague in Madagascar's capital of Tananarive could \"explode\" if local and international efforts to contain the epidemic fall short, a Canadian assessment team deployed by the Red Cross says.\nThe epidemic has made its way into the congested metropolis of just over two million people.\nWhile the World Health Organization (WHO) believes the risk of global spread is low, there is a moderate risk the disease could spread to neighbouring countries in east and southern Africa and a very high risk of spread locally.\nSince the first case was reported on Aug. 31 in Ankazobe district, more than 1,300 cases of suspected, probable and confirmed plague have been identified, and 102 people have died in 18 of Madagascar's 22 regions. In 2014, considered a bad year for plague in Madagascar, only 40 people died. The United Nations says the rapid increase in cases is cause for concern and that \"the situation will continue to deteriorate.\"\n\"This year, we are seeing urban spread of the pneumonic type\" said Tonje Tingberg, the Red Cross field team leader in the country. Two-thirds of cases this year are the highly contagious pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs and is transmitted in the air, unlike the bubonic form of plague that is endemic in rural Madagascar, and which is only transmitted by fleas living on rats. Unlike most years, the plague has hit cities where person-to-person transmission is easier due to urban density and poor sanitation.

{"idx": "24100", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: You might think your legs do all the work when it comes to your running routine, but that\u2019s just not true. Your core muscles, which include your hips, abs, obliques and back, all work to keep you upright, balanced and moving. A strong core is particularly important for trail runners, who need to keep both their back and trunk limber as they maneuver over exposed tree roots and unstable ground while running.\nAll runners can benefit from strong core muscles, as they keep your pelvis where it needs to be. An unaligned pelvis makes you prone to injury such as lower-back pain and hamstring pulls, according to Runner\u2019s World. A strong core also makes you more solid when you strike the ground, reducing the need for your body to stabilize each time. This means a faster running time because you\u2019re a more economical runner.\nIt\u2019s tough when a workout takes you away from running on the treadmill or trail, but focus on your core three times a week for 15 to 20 minutes per session. In each session, aim to complete six core exercises, spending 60 seconds on each one. Take a short break, and then repeat the series of exercises. You\u2019ll be running again in no time.\nAb exercises aren\u2019t just crunches and situps. There\u2019s plenty of variety available to keep your core workouts interesting. Start with step-down exercises by lying on your back with one hand under your lower back. Raise your legs so your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and bend your knees to 90 degrees. Slowly lower your right leg until it\u2019s 1 inch off the floor, hold for two seconds, and then return it to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. Other ab exercises include front and side planks, bicycle crunches, prone stabilizers, reverse crunches and V-ups. Incorporate the use of a stability or medicine ball for a bigger challenge.\nWhen it comes to core strength and balance, yoga offers a great cross-training option for runners. Yoga poses that require standing on one leg require focus on using the core muscles to balance, but for deeper core work, try moves such as the opposite arm and leg pose. Get on all fours with your knees under your hips and hands shoulder-width apart. Extend your right arm forward so it\u2019s in line with your shoulder and back while lifting your left leg back so it\u2019s also in line with your back. Keep your ab muscles engaged and hold the pose for five to 15 breaths; release and repeat on the other side. Repeat three to five times for each side."}

The disaster claimed the lives of 11 workers and critically injured four more.\nBut environmental impact has been huge. Now it has been determined that the amount of air pollutants in the atmospheric plume generated by the oil spill was similar to what happens in a large city.\nNOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) and NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colo., along with university colleagues, focused on ozone and particulate matter\u2014two pollutants with human health effects.\n\"We could see the sooty black clouds from the burning oil, but there's more to this than meets the eye. Our instruments detected a much more massive atmospheric plume of almost invisible small organic particles and pollutant gases downwind of the oil spill site,\" said Ann M. Middlebrook, scientist at NOAA ESRL's Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) and lead author of the study.\nAccording to the study, over the course of the spill, the total mass of organic particles formed from evaporating surface oil was about ten times bigger than the mass of soot from all the controlled burns. Controlled burns are used to reduce the size of surface oil slicks and minimize impacts of oil on sensitive shoreline ecosystems and marine life.\nThe organic particles formed in the atmosphere from hydrocarbons that were released as surface oil evaporated, and they got bigger as they traveled in the plume. The atmospheric plume was about 30 kilometers wide- about 18.5 miles - when it reached the coast.\n\"It was fortunate that the effects on air quality of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were limited in scope,\" said Middlebrook. \"Our findings show that an oil spill closer to populated areas, or in shallower waters, could have a larger effect.\"\nThe findings of the study have been published in a special issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nUrbanization is not bad altogether. Undertaking the correct approaches during urban planning can avoid most of the environmental problems associated with it."}

But, she says many are losing sleep year-round, which has both immediate and long-term impacts.\nSharma says adults need between seven and eight hours of sleep a night \u2014 but not more.

Likewise, \u201ccatching up\u201d on lost hours of sleep doesn\u2019t really work.\nShe says studies have also shown that people who are sleep deprived experience drops in performance, but don\u2019t know they\u2019re making mistakes, which can be a dangerous.\nShe says one thing keeping people from getting sleep is artificial light. Our bodies are programmed to be awake and be asleep according to the sun, but with artificial light, televisions, electronics and more, we don\u2019t feel the urge to sleep when we normally would. Sharma recommends turning the lights down in the evening, and putting down the iPads and iPhones a few hours before bedtime. Many people turn on the television or the computer when they can\u2019t sleep, which is really just perpetuating the problem.\nSharma says sleep apnea is on the rise with the increase in obesity rates.

A lot of relationships rest on our partners meeting very specific preferences. Many people eventually grow resentful of their partners and aren\u2019t afraid of dropping relationships once they reach the point where their partners' quirks and habits \u2014 which once were charming and cute \u2014 suddenly become annoying and bothersome.\nIn Radical Acceptance: The Secret to Happy, Lasting Love, the new book by YourTango founder and CEO Andrea Miller (in stores May 2nd), she makes a potent case for the importance of bringing empathy into every aspect of relationships and the long-term benefits of looking at your partner\u2019s flaws with kindness rather than judgment. According to Andrea's philosophy, love is never wasted. It's not a bad thing to be the one who loves MORE.\nHowever (and this is important), radically accepting your partner does NOT mean being a doormat or putting up with abusive behavior. After all, practicing unconditional love and acceptance should be an empowering act that brings more satisfaction and strength to your relationships. Loving without judgment should benefit both of you, so keep that in mind. You're not there to make excuses for your partner. You're there to develop the most open, honest love you can.\nWhen you meet someone you want to commit to, wholly accepting them \u2014 even their unloveable parts \u2014 requires a tremendous amount of trust and communication. Loving someone unselfishly, striving for true radical acceptance, means loving them in the way that they want to be loved, not the way you want to be loved.\nYou have so much to give the world emotionally, so why hold back?

As a result, two more tanks, one empty and the other containing toluene, a volatile liquid used to make nail polish remover and paint thinner, caught fire.\nITC, which is owned by Japan's Mitsui & Co, said on Tuesday it is bringing in a 15-person crew experienced in battling tank-farm fires, additional high-pressure pumps and suppressant foam to battle the inferno.\n\"We have been up to this point in defensive mode\" trying to contain the fire, said Samuelsen. \"Because of the expertise these guys bring, the expectation is we'll be able to go into offensive mode\" later in the day.\nSamuelsen said the burning tanks are within a six-foot tall earthen berm that is collecting water and chemicals leaking from the tanks. Firefighters are pumping 10,000 to 20,000 gallons of water and foam a minute onto the tanks.\nSome chemicals and water have escaped the site and flowed into a nearby waterway and into the ship channel, he said. ITC has set up containment booms to limit the liquids from spreading and to capture the chemicals. State and federal regulators have said they are monitoring the site.\nSamuelsen said he had no new timetable for when the blaze will be extinguished. On Monday, ITC had said the fire could burn until Wednesday.\nAir-emission readings showed pollution from the chemical fire has not exceeded acceptable levels at ground level measurements, Samuelsen said.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a state regulator, installed additional air monitors near the site, but had no updates early Tuesday, a spokesman said.\nShips continued to move through the 50-mile-long channel, which is part of the Port of Houston linking refineries and chemical plants in Houston and Texas City, with the Gulf of Mexico."}

In North America, daily volume dropped 0.1% to $995 billion in October from a year earlier, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed. Tokyo and Australia also reported declining volumes.\nThe slump was led by a slide in forwards and swaps, which fell 5.6% and 14.3%, respectively, from a year earlier in U.S. markets. The dollar's surprising surge last year might have contributed to those instruments falling out of favor, said Olivier Doleires, head of currencies at UBP's investment management division. For money managers based outside the U.S., a rising greenback would boost returns on unhedged dollar-denominated holdings.\n\"The direction south of other asset classes, mainly equity, fixed income and credit, might have contributed to the decline in FX swap trading,\" said Mr. Doleires, who is based in Geneva. \"Lots of flows went to dollar assets on an unhedged basis.\"\nAn uptick in other instruments wasn't enough to make up the shortfall. Spot market transactions increased 10.6% from the previous year, according to the New York Fed, while usage of options grew by 32.9%.\nThe most recent data from the Bank for International Settlements, from a triennial survey released in 2016, pegged daily global currency-market turnover at $5.1 trillion. That level marked a drop from $5.4 trillion three years earlier.\nDriving the divergence in activity could be the implementation of MiFID II, according to MarketFactory, whose software helps traders aggregate currency prices and manage risks from buying and selling on multiple venues.\n\"Forwards are not as transparent as spot,\" said Executive Chairman and co-founder James Sinclair, who is also a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee. \"Under MiFID II, you have to take all sufficient means necessary to give customers the best results. The tools available to do that are most available in the spot market, rather than forwards.\"\nOne other notable shift was that while euro-dollar remained the most-traded pair in London, the euro-sterling cross has become less busy than dollar-yuan. Average daily turnover in the U.S.-China pair climbed to a record $72.9 billion from $62.2 billion in April, replacing euro-pound as the seventh most-traded currency pair, according to BOE data."}

In view of this, the Environment Ministry is preparing several measures to improve the situation in the future.\nCertain Slovak towns and villages have been struggling with smog recently.

He said that he does not want to order anyone to do anything, but he called on people not to use a fuel that pollutes the air.\nMoreover a new environmental strategy that, among other things, is set to improve air quality should be concluded by the end of this year. It should provide an effective guideline on how to keep pollution under control. In addition, the strategy might include emission requirements for certain home heating boilers that are being placed on the Slovak market as well as state support for replacing unsuitable boilers.\nLadislav \u010c\u00e1rack\u00fd from SHM\u00da reported that smog limits have been exceeded recently mainly due to poor dispersal conditions and severe frost.

Newcastle, the historic capital of the Durham and Northumberland coal fields, had all the coal it needed.\nBut the expression will have to be retired. Last month, the Port of Tyne, Newcastle's harbor, began receiving large-scale coal imports from Russia to fuel a nearby aluminum smelter.\nTwenty years after former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war on the powerful mineworkers union, the coal industry in Britain is clinically dead. And Newcastle, once the industry's gritty hub, has been forced not only to import coal but also to reinvent itself.\nThe visual transformation has been stunning. Newcastle and its sister city, Gateshead, across the river are famous for their collection of bridges on the River Tyne, graceful marvels of steel and stone that reflected the engineering leaps of the Industrial Age. But until recently their riverbanks were a blighted postindustrial no-go zone.\nToday the derelict wharves and warehouses have been transformed into restaurants, art galleries and loft apartments. Ornate Victorian office buildings long ago abandoned by shipping companies have been resuscitated and are occupied by the city's lawyers and stockbrokers. The district, known as the Quayside, thrums with activity day and night.\nThe Quayside's most impressive projects are the Baltic Center for Contemporary Art, the Sage Music Center and a pedestrian bridge over the Tyne that tilts upward to let ships pass. The two buildings are on the Gateshead side of the river.\nThe Baltic, a converted flour mill, is a huge gallery similar in concept to the Tate Modern in London. The Sage, designed by Norman Foster and scheduled to open next month, is a bulbous glass-and-steel concert hall that will be the home of the Northern Sinfonia chamber orchestra.\nFoster's pickle-shaped London office tower, nicknamed the \"Gherkin,\" has become one of that city's most admired new buildings, and residents hope that the Sage's distinctive design along with the Millennium Bridge will do what Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum has done for the once-neglected Basque port city of Bilbao, Spain.\nNewcastle's efforts have not gone unnoticed. Time magazine listed Newcastle as one of Europe's \"secret capitals,\" while Newsweek named it as one of \"the world's eight most creative cities.\"\n\"What you're seeing is the miracle of the National Lottery,\" said Paul Collard, creative director of the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative, a civic marketing group.\nMore than $180 million of the money for the Baltic and Sage projects came from the National Lottery.\nAccording to Collard, the national fondness for gambling generated an \"unbelievable\" amount of cash for investment in arts and culture projects, \"and we had the good luck to be absolutely first in the queue.\"\nWith the success of the Quayside restoration, Newcastle and Gateshead have latched onto the idea of culture-led urban regeneration with a vengeance. Officials say a cultural renaissance has helped reverse the city's decline, but they freely admit they still have a long way to go.\n\"We used culture to get some momentum going, to get some confidence back,\" said Paul Rubenstein, in charge of culture for the Newcastle City Council. \"But in terms of competitiveness, our economy is still far behind Manchester and Leeds, never mind London.\"\nThe collapse of the"}

The move provides diplomatic support but no practical impact on Palestinians' aspirations for statehood.\n\"The conflict between Israel can only be solved with a two-state solution, negotiated in accordance with international law,\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said during his inaugural address to Parliament, according to Reuters.\n\"A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to peaceful co-existence. Sweden will therefore recognize the state of Palestine,\" Lofven said.\nThe Oslo Accord of 1993, which began the now-stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, stipulated that a Palestinian state can be formed only through negotiations.\nThe last round of U.S.-brokered talks fell apart in June and were followed by a third major conflict in six years between Israel and Hamas, the State Department-designated terror group that governs Gaza. More than 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis were killed in the fighting.\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said the Swedish move would have the same practical impact as the United Nations General Assembly's recognition of a Palestinian state in 2012. The Swedes would be recognizing a \"state\" with no set borders, territory under control of competing factions and no real capital, Miller said.\n\"In the end, it's a joke, actually,\" Miller said. \"It confers nothing. It could create a wave of support for growing international recognition of a Palestinian state, but what does it really mean?\"\nThough formal recognition is no substitute for an agreement with Israel, the move is more than symbolic, says Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine.\n\"It doesn't change a thing on the ground,\" Ibish said. \"It changes the number of countries that have recognized the Palestinian state. It changes the Western commitment to a two-state solution, (and) it does put more pressure on Israel to make concessions.\"\nThe move supports the strategy of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who governs the West Bank. Last week in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Abbas called for achieving a Palestinian state alongside Israel through non-violent diplomacy. That contrasts with Hamas, which wants to achieve a state through violence, Ibish said.\nA majority of the European Union's 28 nations do not recognize Palestinian statehood. Those that do are Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, according to the BBC. Several are former Eastern-bloc countries that recognized Palestinian statehood before joining the EU, according to Reuters."}

Nvidia and arch-rival AMD have decided that 30 frames per second at 1080p resolution is the gaming sweet spot, and so the GPU designers have set about beating each other over the head to build the best chips for delivering that performance at a $150 price point.\nWhile both companies happily oblige gamers craving higher performance-those with the financial means to satiate their hunger, that is-it's the mainstream products that generate the most cabbage. And they're certainly justified in designating 1080p a \"mainstream resolution,\" since that's the spec most consumer-oriented 23- and 24-inch displays deliver.\nTo that end, Nvidia is looking to chop the legs out from under AMD, which announced its own \"1080p sweet spot\" offering- the Radeon HD 7790 -just last week. AMD set a price target of $150 for Radeon HD 7790 cards in order to compete with boards based on Nvidia's GeForce GTX 650 Ti, which until then had been the sole occupants of that price bracket.\nThe price of cards based on Nvidia's new GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost GPU will start at $149.\nAMD maintains that its 7790 is on average 20 percent faster than Nvidia's original 650 Ti. But Nvidia announced that existing GeForce GTX 650 Ti cards with 1GB of memory will now sell for just $129.

But there's a slight catch: The 1GB 650 Ti Boost cards won't begin shipping until early April. The models Nvidia says consumers can buy today come with 2GB of memory and cost $169.\nNvidia claims the GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost is on average 10- to 20-percent faster than AMD's Radeon HD 7850.\nNvidia also took the opportunity to counter an AMD talking point: all GeForce 650 Ti Boost cards will operate in two-way SLI, where the original 650 Ti cannot (a pair of AMD Radeon HD 7790 cards, it should be noted, can operate in two-way CrossFire mode).\nThe GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost is outfitted with 768 CUDA cores and runs at a base clock rate of 980 MHz. When the workload demands it, that clock rate is automatically boosted up to a top speed of 1033 MHz. The cards have a 192-bit memory interface to deliver memory speed of 6 gigabytes per second.

Both the white nationalists and left-wing counter-protesters fought and beat each other with blunt objects for most of the morning.\nThe sheer violence and extremism on display in Charlottesville shocked the nation, and politicians all over the spectrum issued strong condemnations of the rally.\nForemost among them were Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Democratic Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer.\nBoth of these Democratic leaders were praised by the media for their response to the violence that unfolded. But, interestingly enough, few reporters are asking them about their responsibility in letting Charlottesville turn into a battlefield between political extremists.\nLaw enforcement was on hand at the dueling demonstrations on Saturday, decked out in riot gear and looking prepared for the worst. Except they weren\u2019t allowed to do their job. Police on the scene were reported to have been ordered to \u201cnot intervene until given command to do so,\u201d according to the ACLU. That kept them from suppressing the numerous scuffles that broke out.\nWhen police were ordered to disperse the alt-right rally, that act directed the white nationalists into the antifa demonstrators, leading to further street brawls. Police didn\u2019t seem to try to get in between the two groups or suppress the fights.\nAs ProPublica reported, state police and National Guardsmen mostly stood aside and watched as the violence grew worse.\nThis appears to be a direct result of what appears to be a stand down order from higher-ups.\nWhen the alt-right rally was mostly dispersed, police still seemed a missing presence in the city as the leftists kept demonstrating, some armed with aluminum bats and other weapons. This is the scene where the white nationalist drove his car through pedestrians, with police seemingly far away from the action.\nThat absence allowed for a female reporter who was an eyewitness to the intentional crash to be allegedly punched in the face by antifa. The reason: because she was press.\nCuriously, this attack on a journalist hasn\u2019t netted much attention.\nThe chaos seems like it could have been contained and fewer people hurt if police were a more active presence in Charlottesville.\nBoth sides of the rally have been critical of police inaction in the rally, putting blame on them for the out-of-control violence that occurred on Sunday.\nMcAuliffe was asked about the criticism of law enforcement\u2019s inaction Sunday, to which he offered an odd response \u2014 he blamed the presence of armed militia for why police didn\u2019t do more.\n\u201cThey had better equipment than our State Police had,\u201d the governor said of why police stayed put and watched the violence unfold.\nBut, according to ProPublica, the militia members seemed to be the only ones breaking up fights and trying to keep the peace in the tumult.\nIt would have probably been more effective in suppressing the violence if the men and women paid to keep the peace for a living were out in the mix.\nThese street battles have become more common in our country following Trump\u2019s inauguration, and they have gotten out of hand when police are ordered to stand down.

The proposal would bar providers like Comcast from blocking websites, but they could charge websites for faster service as long as the arrangements are \"commercially reasonable.\"\nWheeler is trying to rewrite the net-neutrality regulations after a federal appeals court struck down the old (stronger) rules earlier this year. The commission is now accepting comments on its proposal and will have to vote again in several months to enact final regulations.\nWheeler's proposal has outraged many liberals, who argue that \"fast lanes\" would allow Internet providers to extort \"tolls\" and stifle innovative start-ups that can't afford to pay. Activists camped outside the FCC last week, demanding that Wheeler enact stronger net-neutrality rules.\n\"I support a ban on paid prioritization deals,\" Rep. Doris Matsui, a California Democrat, said. \"We can't afford a two-tiered Internet system.\"\nShe warned that if Wheeler's proposal moves forward, it could \"inadvertently block the next Google or Amazon from the market without evening knowing it.\"\n\"Paid prioritization represents a fundamental departure form the Internet as we know it,\" warned California Rep. Anna Eshoo, the subcommittee's top Democrat. She pressed Wheeler to explicitly state whether he would would ban paid-prioritization of Internet traffic.\nWheeler explained that his proposal would at least block deals that are bad for competition or consumers.\nHe tried to allay the Democrats' concerns, stating repeatedly he wants to protect the openness of the Internet.\n\"There is not a fast Internet and a slow Internet. There is one Internet,\" he said. \"When a consumer is buying access to the Internet, they are buying access to the full Internet.\"\nHe promised he wouldn't allow providers to degrade service in order to make fast lanes more appealing. The commission has also asked for input on whether it should try to ban pay-for-priority outright.\nBut Wheeler is in a tough spot legally. When the D.C.

A court in the country ruled that Ablyazov's Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement was an extremist group earlier this year.\nThe attempts to hold opposition protests come at a sensitive time in the oil-rich Central Asian country amid mounting speculation that Nazarbayev will not stand again when his present presidential term ends in 2020.\nThe head of the Almaty-based Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights monitor Yevgeny Zhovtis told AFP that \"the majority of the detained have now been released\" without charge.\n\"But some are still at police stations,\" he said, noting that one of his colleagues at the rights group was among those detained and then released.\nZhovtis put the overall number of detained in Almaty at \"up to 50.\"\nAn AFP correspondent in the capital Astana could not confirm media reports of detentions at a similar protest planned there.\nThe state prosecutor's office and the ministry of internal affairs declined to comment on the detentions when contacted by AFP.\nA journalist in the northwestern city of Uralsk told AFP that four of his colleagues from the city's leading independent newspaper Uralsk Week and a reporter from Radio Free Europe were detained while intending to cover a rally that did not take place.\nUralsk Week journalist Raul Uporov told AFP the journalists were formally taken to a police station for questioning as witnesses over an unrelated case.\nThe Radio Free Europe journalist was later released as well as three journalists from the newspaper.\nPolitical rallies are deemed illegal unless officially sanctioned in Kazakhstan, a law that rights groups say is designed to suppress civil society.\nAblyazov, who is believed to be based in France was last year found guilty of embezzling billions of dollars from BTA bank, once a leading lender in the republic, in an investigation dating back to 2009, when he fled the country.\nHe received a 20-year sentence in absentia and has denied any wrongdoing.\nHe promised to topple the Kazakh government \"in the space of three years\" after France refused to extradite him to Russia in December to face separate charges of corruption linked to BTA in 2016."}

Topics will include, but will not be limited to, connections of regulation for intermediaries, households and policymakers in the U.S. and outside the U.S.\nThe papers for this session are invited from the fields of empirical Industrial Organization (IO), Labor Economics, Public Finance, and Health Economics, Environmental and Energy Economics, and Development Economics. The unifying feature of the papers should be that they each contain a theoretical model of an economic interaction and an empirical implementation of this theoretical model using actual data. Popular topics for papers from previous years\u2014the empirical implementation of models of auction market equilibrium, discrete choice models of differentiated product demand and oligopoly equilibrium, dynamic models of individual and group behavior, and analysis of experiment data of policy interventions in circumstances of non-random assignment or self-selection. A clear link between the theoretical economic model and econometric model should be a hallmark of the papers presented.\nThe idea of this session is to bring together microeconomic theorists working on dynamic games and contracts with more applied theorists working in macro, finance, organizational economics, and other fields. First, this is a venue to discuss the latest questions and techniques facing researchers working in dynamic games and contracts. Second, we wish to foster interdisciplinary discussion between scholars working on parallel topics in different disciplines, in particular, helping raise awareness among theorists of the open questions in other fields. We\u2019re aiming for a roughly even split between micro theory papers and papers from other areas. Specific topics likely to be covered include repeated and stochastic games, dynamic optimal contracts, dynamic market pricing, reputation, search, and learning and experimentation.\nThis workshop will be dedicated to advances in experimental economics combining laboratory and field-experimental methodologies with theoretical and psychological insights on decision-making, strategic interaction and policy. We invite papers in lab experiments, field experiments and their combination that test theory, demonstrate the importance of psychological phenomena, and explore social and policy issues. In addition to senior faculty members, invited presenters will include junior faculty as well as graduate students.\nThe purpose of this SITE workshop is to bring together researchers working on issues at the intersection of psychology and economics. The workshop focuses on evidence of and explanations for non-standard choice patterns, as well as the positive and normative implications of those patterns in important economic decision-making contexts such as lifecycle consumption and savings, labor supply, effort provision, financial contracting, and firm pricing. Many past presenters at this workshop have built upon insights from other disciplines, including psychology and sociology. Theoretical, empirical, and experimental studies will be included.\nThe session will cover recent work on the causes and effects of changes in volatility and uncertainty in the aggregate economy, which is incredibly topical given the recent Brexit and Trump election outcomes. Many observers, including policymakers such as Bernanke, Summers, and Romer, have highlighted that these have been major driving factors in the recent credit-crunch recession and advanced heuristic arguments of why this might have been the case. Unfortunately, our theoretical and empirical understanding of these topics is limited since only recently have macroeconomist started working on these issues from a more systematic basis. Nevertheless, the preliminary results in the literature, to which all three of us have contributed, are rather encouraging. Changes in volatility and uncertainty similar to the ones observed for the U.S. economy can be shown to be quantitatively significant factors in business cycle fluctuations and a key element in a successful explanation of aggregate fluctuations. Moreover, the presence of changes in volatility and uncertainty has important implications for the design of optimal policies and for our assessment of the"}

It looked at patients in New York state who had certain stroke-related billing codes from 2003 to 2012. It divided the women into age groups as well as whether they were pregnant or within six weeks of having been pregnant.\nThe found a direct relation between pregnancy and stroke, which was even more pronounced the younger the women were. Women ages 12 to 24 had more than double the rate of stroke risk during or right after pregnancy. Those 25-34 had a 60 percent increase of stroke rate. These are still relatively small numbers though: In the 12-24 group, it was 14 women per 100,000 versus 6.4 per 100,000 for nonpregnant/postpartum women. In the 25-34 age group, 21.2 per 100,000 pregnant or post pregnant women had stroke versus 13.5 per 100,000.\nThe risk is not significantly different after age 34. In the 35-44 group it was 33 per 100,000 versus 31 per 100,000. And in the 45-54 group, it\u2019s 46.9 pregnant or post-pregnant women with strokes versus 73.7 nonpregnant women with strokes. The risk for stroke goes up with age, but the pregnancy does not appear to affect it as much in that 35-44 age group. And the oldest group, probably doesn\u2019t have as many pregnancies to begin with, thus limiting the number of stroke patients who have also been pregnant recently or are pregnant.\nDr. Steven Warach is the medical director of Seton\u2019s Stroke Institute.\nWhat is significant about this study is that it does find the correlation between pregnancy and younger women who have had stroke. Dr. Steven Warach, who is the medical director of the Seton\u2019s Stroke Institute, explains that the prevailing thinking is that there is a link between estrogen and blood clotting. We know that there is a link between stroke and oral contraception that contains estrogen and stroke and hormone replacement therapies with estrogen in them, he says. Pregnancy and those six weeks of post-pregnancy are a time when a woman\u2019s estrogen levels are high and then in flux.\nWhat the study also found was the type of stroke these women were having. The pregnant or post-pregnant women were having strokes from clots in their veins instead of in their arteries, which is the more common type of stroke.\nOf the pregnant or postpartum women who had had strokes, 54.1 percent had had a cesarean delivery, 32.5 percent had had gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia; 14.7 percent had had an infection present, about half of which was the bacterial infection chorioamnionitis.\nWhy weren\u2019t the numbers higher for pregnant women versus nonpregnant women after age 35? More conventional risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes start to go up in the regular population. The pregnant women who had had strokes were less likely to have those risk factors, though.\n"}

What was unique about them were the capsules of cocaine found in the cookies, which landed the man in jail.\nIn a related report by The Inquisitr, drug runners are starting to innovate how they get drugs into the United States. Usually, it would be with \u201cdrug mules,\u201d who are men or women who live in the United States who leave the country for a couple of days, then come back with with smuggled cocaine. How they do it is usually through their digestive systems. However, that is not always the case, as a truck at the Mexican border was seized which contained $1.6 million worth of marijuana. What was unique about the bust was the truck, which looked like a government vehicle. Another example, relating to cocaine trafficking, included two women who filled two condoms with cocaine. What is unique about this bust was where they hid the cocaine-filled condoms, which are usually places a condom would be associated with.\nAccording to a report by New York Daily News, dozens of seemingly delicious cookies were found in the man\u2019s suitcase, but were nothing but a front for over $50,000 worth of cocaine. Tiny capsules of cocaine were found inside the basked goods when Mauricio Isidro Rivera Hernandez landed in Newark Liberty International Airport on June 5. He would have gotten away with it if Hernandez didn\u2019t act so nervous when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found the cookies.\nAuthorities took Hernandez into a private room and discovered the 118 small oval-shaped capsules containing a white powdery substance that tested positive for cocaine. The precise price of the drugs smuggled were $52,000. Afterwards, Hernandez was turned over to Port Authority Police officers, and now faces charges for narcotics smuggling.\nThis isn\u2019t actually anything new for the drug cops. According to The Examiner, baking cookies just to hide capsules of cocaine in them is just one example of how drug mules use food to smuggle in the illegal drug. Last month, eighteen pounds of narcotics were found in a custard, and the month before that, seven pounds of narcotics were found inside frozen meat.\nIn conclusion, this just shows how astute customs agents are in catching drug mules, and where they stand in the war against drugs. Unfortunately, many of the narcotics do get by because they can\u2019t simply check every single piece of luggage and search every single person with a fine-tooth comb\u2026 and that is what the drug mules are betting on."}

We had all collaborated at varying degrees during our teens and were fans of each other\u2019s musical projects and style of playing. The band\u2019s inception can be traced back to Herman [Spiteri] and Andr\u00e9 [Portelli]\u2019s idea to blend their musical roots with electronic influences. Simon [Deguara] and Mark [Zammit] were approached to give life to an idea which had been long in the making. It is the diversity between the members\u2019 musical influences which has actually paved the way for the development of KTA\u2019s sound.\nHow has your experience of being in previous bands shaped the way you approach the music of Kill the Action?\nWe were all after developing the band\u2019s sound around an \u2018electronic backbone\u2019 which could also accommodate alternative and rock influences. The song-writing process has been instrumental in achieving a balance between the use of ambient-style synths and fat synth bass sounds on the one hand, and melodic and driving guitar sounds on the other.\nAs opposed to our experiences with previous bands, the ongoing challenge to merge electronic and rock influences to accommodate both their strengths, has led to our individual styles of playing having to take a back seat at times in the interests of the particular track under production. The song-writing process has, over time, also become more focused and task-oriented, similar to the song-writing process utilised by electronic artists.\nYou\u2019ve released two singles so far: The Inside and Last Train (Straight to Nowhere). How did the sound that characterises these tracks evolve, and are you currently working on either an EP or an album release?\nThe Inside is hard-hitting and upbeat. It started off as a beat and a couple of riffs which were quickly re-structured. The track remained untouched for a number of months until its post-production where the main synth bass line was added along with some background dissonance. The synth line in the \u2018middle eight\u2019 was also added in the studio to resemble an 80s pop song gone wild.\nLast Train is slower. It, too, was re-structured in the studio. There\u2019s more guitar work going on, with the track\u2019s main synth line being used as a backdrop to set the track\u2019s overall tone and vibe. Nonetheless, the track still contains a healthy dose of analog weirdness, which is characteristic of the band\u2019s sound.\nAs regards our plans to release more material in the future, we are currently experimenting with distributing our music online at regular intervals prior to distributing physical copies of an EP. We do have plans to release a selection of tracks in the near future and to re-visit certain material with the aim of experimenting with different production techniques.\nWhat are some of the challenges local musicians face \u2013 when it comes to both performance venues and the financial viability of being in a band? And are any of those challenges made easier or harder by the internet?\nWould it be appropriate to mention the government\u2019s half-baked \u2018plan\u2019 to provide local musicians with practice spaces and venues in order to promote a musical culture which is undoubtedly still dull and very conservative? Or might such mention, in itself, be considered as being politically incorrect? What about local radio stations \u2018playing it safe\u2019 or the \u2018monopoly\u2019 of a handful of bar owners who half-heartedly allow musicians to perform at their venues for a fraction of their revenue?

One of Hill's daughters says the marriage was improper and that Hill's estate is now in question.\nThe recent marriage of two nonagenarians might seem romantic ... but the family of 96-year-old Edith Hill doesn't think so. The Associated Press is reporting a legal dispute in Alexandria, Va., between Hill's daughter Patricia Barber and Barber's sister, Rebecca Wright, who took their mother to marry 95-year-old Eddie Harrison.\nCary Cuccinelli, Barber's attorney, said at a hearing last week that Hill has been declared legally incapacitated for many years and that Wright's decision to facilitate the marriage without court permission was \"improper.\"\nNow, says Cuccinelli, Harrison has legal rights to Hill's estate, which includes real estate in the pricey Old Town area of Alexandria. Hill's property there is worth about $475,000. The dispute also claims the marriage complicates Hill's care and living situation.\nJudge James Clark agreed with Barber that the process of the marriage was improper, but he didn't want to immediately separate the newlyweds. He decided to remove both daughters as Hill's legal guardians and instead appointed another attorney, Jessica Niesen. Niesen now has the task of investigating the marriage and protecting Hill's interests.\nIf Niesen finds that the marriage does not benefit Hill or her estate, she can pursue a divorce or annulment. But, she told the AP, she won't break up the marriage if she finds no damaging information. She also opposes the idea of a postnuptial agreement, which would deny Harrison access to Hill's estate. Niesen says the marriage should be given equal treatment if found to be a good arrangement for Hill.\nHill and Harrison met more than a decade ago while waiting in line to buy lottery tickets. One of the tickets was a winner, worth $2,500, but both walked away with more than cash. The two have been companions ever since. A church elder presided over their marriage ceremony earlier this year.\nWhat makes this case particularly noteworthy is Wright's claim that Hill and Harrison may be the oldest interracial married couple in the country. Hill is black and Harrison is white. A legal marriage in the commonwealth of Virginia would not have been possible if the couple had met when they were young.\nIn an interview with WUSA9, Harrison hugged Hill and said \"we'll be like this always regardless of what happens.\"\nHill and Harrison live in nearby Annandale, Va., with Wright and her daughter, Robin."}

Given Sparks generally only plays the second night of Toronto\u2019s back-to-backs, he didn\u2019t have to wait long for another chance between the pipes after last Saturday\u2019s debacle, and all eyes will be on the netminder to see how he lives up to his word.\nWhile the other Leafs can appreciate Sparks is the type to \u201cwear his heart on his sleeve\u201d as Mitch Marner put it, they don\u2019t necessarily agree there\u2019s been a lack of emotion to their game.\nAnd becoming angrier may not even help the Leafs anyway, especially if it distracts them from the bigger focuses on the ice.\nThe last time Alex Nylander stood opposite his brother William in a game, it was April 3, 2017, and the younger Nylander was making his NHL debut.\nIn the nearly two years since then, Alex has honed his craft primarily with the American Hockey League\u2019s Rochester Americans, while William became an integral part of the Leafs\u2019 offence and went through a highly publicized contract dispute with the team last fall.\nRegardless of how their paths diverged, Alex is thrilled they\u2019re set to cross once again on Wednesday.\nThis season only recently became enjoyable again for William, as he struggled to reestablish his game following the stalemate that cost him two months of the schedule.

The DNA allowed them to draw up a family tree of the virus that traced its ancestry through time and space. Using statistical models they could push farther back than the 1950s and locate the origin of the pandemic in 1920s Kinshasa.\nPeople with HIV in central Africa at the time did not have specific symptoms that would have been written down in their medical records. The virus causes the immune system to collapse, leaving people open to all manner of infections. \"For an epidemic like HIV where we're trying to track back to before it was even discovered, genetics is the only source of information we have,\" said Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and senior author on the study.\nThe genetic data suggests that pandemic HIV spread rapidly through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country the size of western Europe. From the late 1930s to the early 1950s, the virus spread by rail and river to Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi in the south and Kisangani in the north. There the virus took hold and formed secondary reservoirs from where it spread to countries in southern and eastern Africa.\nTo be clear: The AIDS virus is believed to have spilled over into the human population years before it gained purchase in Kinshasa, but conditions there were such that the infection was first able to proliferate and spread. It did so quietly at first, stealing its steady way through the surrounding area for several decades before thundering, deadly and swift, across the globe."}

Like many rich men, Irving was utterly convinced of his own virtues, and impatient with any who dared criticize. Fans who voiced their disapproval of his plans were condemned as politically-motivated troublemakers. He is best remembered at White Hart Lane for the destruction of The Shelf, the popular terrace which afforded one of the best views of any of the famous kops. A long and bitter battle was fought, resulting in the retention of a small strip of terrace along the front of Irv\u2019s beloved executive boxes. The atmosphere at White Hart Lane has never been the same since.\nIrving spearheaded the concept of the football club as a business, his slick, bullish approach perfectly in touch with the rampant Thatcherism of the time. TH plc had to diversify, so the bolt-on companies such as Stumps, Martex proliferated, and the club struck up a deal with kit manufacturers Hummel.\nBut strokes of genius such as going into the textile business at the start of a recession or, as in Hummel\u2019s case, failing to supply kit to such high profile clients as Southampton FC, turned the network of companies into a burden. As the 80s drew to a close, it became obvious there was a serious financial crisis at Tottenham.\nIn October 1990, Irving Scholar resigned from the Spurs board, whose other members were known to be unhappy at his failure to inform them he was negotiating a loan deal with Robert Maxwell. Chaos and uncertainty abounded. When Scholar floated Spurs on the Stock Exchange, one of his claims was that this would give shareholders a chance to be more involved in their club.\nYet at an often-postponed AGM on New Year\u2019s Eve 1990, with the club\u2019s accounts still not ready, the board stonewalled all questions, and relied on their own majority shareholdings to defeat calls for their resignation. They also refused to answer questions about bids from a consortium rumoured to include Terry Venables and Frank Warren \u2013 a group favoured by the overwhelming majority of fans over the dreaded Maxwell.\nWhen the Venables deal finally succeeded, Scholar had to break his last links with the club \u2013 leaving after a series of massive Scholar Out demonstrations. Scholar may have learnt from his mistakes, although the track record of his ilk doesn\u2019t give much cause for optimism.\nThe investigation into the Maxwell loan episode, published in the Ashurst Report, offers a further example of Irving\u2019s style.

Despite already having a world premiere, it will be screened as part of the gala events.\nThe Canadian festival takes place between Sept. 7 to Sept. 17. It is seen as an essential stop for films hoping to score with Academy Awards voters, because it has a long track record of highlighting films that go on to awards glory. Previous Best Picture winners such as \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d have boosted their Oscar campaigns after enjoying a warm reception from Toronto crowds.

Netflix fell short of subscriber targets during the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has historically offered conservative guidance that it can easily beat. It also served up uninspiring guidance for the third quarter, and now there are fears that it didn&apos;t set the bar low enough.\nBig-data analytics specialist M Science is forecasting that Netflix gained as many domestic subscribers as it lost during the quarter, well short of the 300,000 net additions that Netflix itself was projecting earlier this summer. This was already going to be a challenging quarter. Longtime subscribers who were grandfathered into the original rate of $7.99 a month for the flagship streaming service when it was bumped up to $8.99 more than two years ago and $9.99 last year now have to pay the current rate. However, that change should have already been baked into Netflix&apos;s original outlook.\nMost of Netflix&apos;s growth over the past two years has come from its international gains, but there will be a jolt to the stock if stateside subscribers are peaking.\nSeptember treated iFans to the updated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, but Apple was mysteriously silent in pushing out sales data for the iPhone&apos;s debut weekend. It warned that it would no longer be doing this -- and a supply shortage on the iPhone Plus end didn&apos;t help -- but this does make Apple&apos;s Oct. 27 earnings report more interesting than usual.We will finally get sales data on the iPhone and the new Apple Watch, at least through the end of September.\nAnalysts have been warming up to Apple this summer. The iPhone 7 launch appears to be going better than expected, as many were writing it off until we get to next year&apos;s 10th anniversary edition.

A productive co-worker may be a bad person in his personal life; just as, incongruously, a poor co-worker could spend his weekends working at a homeless shelter.

Along the same lines, how different is Mickey Mantle\u2019s legacy if photos of his legendary benders were documented on TerezOwens.com? I\u2019m posing these questions because the Bruins cleverly leaked concerns over Tyler Seguin\u2019s lifestyle to the media days before trading the former second overall pick of the 2010 NHL Draft to Dallas.\nOrganizations used to fear players showing up on the web surrounded by girls that weren\u2019t their wife, with beer(s) in hand, and an ice luge in the background.

Perhaps if the data figures are much higher than what their current expected trend is, then they may go for a hike in December,\u201d Neuteboom told International Business Times.\n\u201cThe central bank may want to monitor price stability closely in the coming two months and, if it deviates from the baseline scenario (20.8 percent on end-2018), take action in December,\u201d she added.\nApart from the rate hike, the Turkish government had also announced a few other measures -- dubbed The New Economy Plan -- to fight inflation in September.\nFinance minister Berat Albayrak, who announced the measures, projected inflation to fall to 15.9 percent in 2019 on an annualised basis.\nTurkish inflation reached almost 25 percent year-on-year in September, its highest level since August 2003.\nAlbayrak\u2019s plan included a 10 percent discount on certain consumer goods, changes to lower the prices of fruits and vegetable, holding the prices of natural gas and electricity for the rest of this year and an acceleration in VAT rebates.\nNeuteboom said these unorthodox measures by themselves were insufficient to counter high inflation. She expects them to have a small effect in the short-term, but said it will not solve the underlying structural issues that cause price pressures in the long term.\nShe expects Turkey\u2019s inflation to rise to 28 percent in October, before falling to 24 percent in December. In 2019, Neuteboom sees inflation to stay above 20 percent until mid-year, before slipping to 12 percent in December 2019.

But Donald Trump's ascent to the top of the Republican ticket has changed their fortunes.\nLongtime advocates for shutting the door to new immigrants now hold crucial positions in Trump's campaign, and many feel, for the first time in recent memory, they have a candidate who is willing to speak plainly about reducing immigration flows and offers their clearest shot yet at influencing, perhaps even drastically altering, U.S. immigration policy.\nJoe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff and poster child for workplace raids and traffic stops, earned a prized seat on Trump's airplane a few months ago, spending hours with his new close friend. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the fiercest opponent of GOP-backed \"amnesty\" bills in Congress for the last decade, now smiles and demurs when asked whether he might serve as Trump's running mate or settle for a Cabinet position.\nAnd NumbersUSA, long on the fringes of Washington lobbying groups with its stance that legal immigration should be reduced, now crows that all those powerful consultants had it wrong when they insisted that the GOP needed to compromise on raising immigration levels to win a presidential election.\n\"Trump broke all the rules \u2026 got hammered for it, and just kept going,\" said Rosemary Jenks, vice president and director of government relations for NumbersUSA.\nTrump's upending of the Republican establishment has sapped clout from many who are used to having it, and empowered others who had grown accustomed to the margins. Nowhere is that reordering more pronounced than the immigration debate, in which Trump's rise has exposed a widening gap between the party's elites -- and stalwart allies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- and its voters.\nTrump's ascent vindicates those who argue that working-class voters see immigration as a threat to financial security. But the political argument has only been proved in Republican primaries, meaning Trump's allies in the immigration policy community could lose their influence if he is defeated in the general election, in which a large Latino turnout favoring Hillary Clinton could doom the GOP candidate.\nFor now, allies such as Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff whose controversial immigration enforcement tactics prompted an investigation from President Obama's Justice Department, are relishing the moment. Arpaio said he received a note from Trump three years ago because of their mutual interest in questioning Obama's birthplace -- an unfounded conspiracy theory -- but did not meet the candidate in person until a year ago, when he introduced Trump at a campaign rally in Phoenix. Recently, Arpaio's ailing wife received an uplifting six-minute phone call from Trump.\nArpaio said he has endorsed Republicans in prior presidential elections, but never with the same fervor.\n\"He doesn't need to go through my wife to hook me,\" Arpaio said. \"He had me hooked to begin with.\"\nSessions may have the deepest ties to Trump among anyone in Congress.

Eris (which Brown nicknamed Xena, before the International Astronomical Union settled on its official name), though, was evidently a little larger \u0097 and that discovery set off an international furor. If Pluto was a planet, Eris obviously was too. And if so, why not Quaoar and Sedna, and several other worlds, which were smaller than Pluto, but not by much?\nIn the end, the astronomical union avoided the whole mess by demoting Pluto and the rest to the status of \"dwarf planet,\" infuriating Pluto partisans around the world (an odd category, when you think about it: there are no rabid fan clubs for Jupiter or Mercury or Mars). Brown ultimately poked Pluto lovers again when he wrote a book titled How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming. The one hope Pluto fans had for revenge was that it was very tough to pin down Eris' size exactly. Maybe it would end up proving smaller than Pluto after all. That wouldn't restore Pluto to full planethood, but it would make them feel better, anyway.\nNow a team of astronomers has finally nailed down Eris' size with high precision, and the answer is that it may be bigger than Pluto, or it may not \u0097 but the difference is probably pretty small either way. Much more significant, says Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory, lead author of a paper on the discovery in the latest Nature, is that despite their comparable size, Eris is some 27% more massive than Pluto. What's more, it's prettier, with a surface Sicardy describes as \"brighter than new fallen snow.\"\nMeasuring the size of something 24 billion km (15 billion miles) away is no mean feat. It is, says Sicardy, \"like measuring a coin at a distance of 100 miles.\" Even with the Hubble telescope, Eris looks like a featureless pinpoint. The only way to gauge its size accurately was to wait for it to pass in front of a distant star, in what's known as an occultation. All you have to do then is time how long it takes the star to reappear on the other side and you can calculate the size of the obscuring object. Two years ago, Sicardy and his team found a good star in what seemed to be the right spot \u0097 but they couldn't be sure the two bodies would actually cross paths until it was about to happen. \"You need to know the location of the star and the orbit of Eris very, very precisely.\"\nFortunately, they chose well. Last November, the occultation took place. \"It's amazing it works!\" says Sicardy, who knew better than anyone how hard it was to predict."}

He will no doubt revive some of his early impressions as to the irresistible strength of Great Britain, and be told, pro- bably for the first time in a convincing manner, that there are points of policy upon which this country will not give way, even if ,the alternative should be the reconquest of the Transvaal. He will undents.nd what is meant by the protection of the Outlanders, and may have his mind cleared of some suspicions by which it is obviously haunted. He will come face to face with Mr. Chamberlain and other modern statesmen, and may be convinced that whatever his country may have to dread, it is not British craft. On the other hand, he may be annoyed to find that South Africa is only one among many interests that Great Britain has to consider; he may be, indeed will be, sur- rounded by flattering Envoys from other countries of Europe, and he will be a mark for the European financiers, who are always seeking concessions and profitable contracts. He is vain enough already, or he would not, in defiance of all Republican precedent, have put his own head on the Transvaal coinage; and he may go back believing that his personality is the pivot of South Africa, if not of the universe at large. That alternative result of his visit, which will be acknowledged to be at least possible, will not tend to pacification. We do not quite see either how the visit is to help him in playing his very difficult game within the Transvaal itself. He is himself more or less of a statesman, who understands something of the relative strength of States, though he probably does not quite understand what sea-power ; but he rules by virtue of popularity with twenty thousand freeholders, who are unusually ignorant, who are opinionated to foolishness, and who have acquired from events in their history an overweening confidence in their military prowess. They really believe, in spite of General Joubert's warning on the subject, that they have de- feated the British Army. They think that they can remain masters in the Transvaal for a century without making any concessions whatever, they despise the British in the way that our own country squires used to despise townsfolk, and they are morbidly suspicious of being \"given away\" by their own elected rulers. Favourite as Mr. Kruger is, they will trust him rather less after his visit than before,\u2014feeling, as country cousins do when one of their number has visited a great house in town, an in- ward conviction that he has been \" caught \" by a more polished and less trustworthy \"society.\" They are opposed to all concessions whatever ; they are eagerly desirous of \"independence,\" by which they mean exemption from the control even of British opinion; and they witness with disgust, though they profit by it, the immense prosperity of the Outlanders. They think that the English, if not cowardly, are \" soft \" \u2014 an opinion also held by Western Americans\u2014and are inclined therefore to break away from the British Empire alto- gether, accepting the consequences, which, as they fancy, would be only a successful \"battle \"\u2014that is, skirmish\u2014 or two.

That caps a year-to-date loss of 22%. It&apos;s been a tough spell for the world&apos;s largest publicly traded uranium miner.\nSo what: Cameco had been holding up relatively well in July up until the last few days of the month, when it reported earnings. In fact, prior to reporting earnings, the shares were only down around 3% or so in the month. That&apos;s pretty impressive, too, given the news out of Japan that an anti-nuclear power governor had been elected in the only region with a running nuclear power plant.\nJapan shut down all of its nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster in 2011 and has only recently been looking to start them up again. The decision to shut down reactors had a huge impact on the entire uranium industry and helped to create a lot of uncertainty in the market, pushing uranium prices lower. If Japan backtracks on its plans to restart its nuclear fleet, that headwind will return. Couple that with an oversupplied market, and it&apos;s no wonder that uranium prices have been weak this year.\nSo when Cameco reported a quarterly loss of $0.35 a share on July 28, it wasn&apos;t the least bit surprising. The company earned $0.22 a share in the same quarter a year ago. And even adjusted earnings weren&apos;t all that great at a loss of $0.14 a share -- well off the results from last year, when adjusted earnings came in at $0.12 a share. Clearly, it&apos;s tough for Cameco right now.\nHowever, it was the outlook that probably hurt the most. Cameco essentially told investors that things are bad, which investors already knew, but that there wasn&apos;t a clear indication of when the uranium market would see notable improvement. With that kind of an outlook, no wonder the shares ended the month with a 12% loss.\nNow what: The long-term picture for nuclear power hasn&apos;t really changed. Nuclear power plants are being built in key markets like India and China and that should help to support long-term demand for uranium. But this long-term view doesn&apos;t do much to assuage investor concerns over the near-term problems, which are very real and are having a big impact on Cameco&apos;s top and bottom lines.\nAll told, Cameco probably isn&apos;t the best option for conservative investors. However, if you believe that nuclear power has a bright future globally as emerging economies turn to the low-carbon power option, Cameco&apos;s struggling share price could be a contrarian opportunity -- but only if you have a strong stomach."}

In early February, the group reported there had already been 18 school shootings since Jan. 1, 2018.\nGenerally, when one thinks of \u201cschool shootings,\u201d they think of incidents like Columbine or Parkland. But, as the Washington Post pointed out in a Feb. 14 article, that wasn\u2019t the case here.\nOne incident included in Everytown\u2019s statistics was a man shooting a gun in the air on the campus of Wake Forest University at 8 p.m. In this case, the shooter wasn\u2019t aiming at anyone, and no one was injured. Another incident cited a man committing suicide with a gun on school property. The argument made against that statistic was that the school had been closed for seven months at the time.\nBoth the left-leaning Washington Post as well as several right-leaning websites like Breitbart attacked the numbers for misrepresenting school shootings in a way that made it appear there were more school shootings than there actually were.\nAnd the writers of the Everytown article likely intended it that way as part of a push to support an agenda for gun reform.\nSadly, in another political climate, those same statistics could potentially be used to gain useful information to improve gun safety on school grounds. Was the night shooter putting anyone in danger? Could the suicide have been prevented?\nBut these finer points get lost in the debate as the weaponization of statistics makes it increasingly difficult to even agree on what the definition of a mass or school shooting is.\nBut other organizations define a mass shooting as at least four or more people shot.\nAnd then there are questions of how motive plays into defining mass or school shootings. Is terrorism a mass shooting event, or its own separate category? What about gang violence? Is a drive-by shooting of several individuals a mass shooting? What if it occurs at school but is limited to gang members? Is it a mass shooting if one person kills only family members? And if the shooter takes his or her own life at the end, should they be included in the death toll or only their victim(s)?\nAll of these variables can be added or subtracted to bolster the arguments of the side presenting them. Some gun reformers want higher numbers"}

The milestone served as an important reminder of the fifteen-year framework that is now in place.\nThe SDGs were built around a common, global agenda with a clear set of 17 development objectives designed to alleviate poverty by 2030. The result of the broadest consultation process ever undertaken by the UN.\nHowever, in order for the 2030 Agenda to be truly successful, both the public and private sector must embrace its framework for policy and investment.\nThat said, beyond the confines of the United Nations, it is becoming increasingly evident from extensive, external consultation with both the public and private sector\u2014that there is still a great deal of practical education and advocacy work to be done.\nMany companies are still grappling with what exactly the SDGs are and with planning efforts to address them. Learning from our ongoing experience it is essential that we cast a wider net and continue to help companies understand and translate the SDGs into meaningful action.\nThere is a critical need to determine how we unpack the SDGs in a way that they are no longer mysterious to the private sector, diplomatic community and governments. For those who have been not been involved in the implementation and preparatory discussion of the goals, there is a real need to help educate a larger community of practice and facilitate knowledge sharing at all levels.\nWith this in mind, UNITAR, and the Sustainable Development Goals Fund have prepared an important online training course to deliver innovative training to address the needs of business and institutions. The course will increase understanding and provide expert insight as part of a new e-Learning tool and curriculum to provide specialized training modules to promote grounded knowledge about the SDGs.\nBy breaking down the 17 goals to meet the needs of business, the SDGs can be firmly adapted to showcase clear and meaningful targets and plans. The course also provided case studies, examples and indicators of how public-private partnerships for achieving SDGs can be shaped. It is based mainly in the experience shared by the SDG Fund\u00b4s Private Sector Advisory Group and partners.\nWhat\u2019s needed now is for the UN to allow for governments, civil society and companies is to understand the key principles so they can build on their own internal systems of management, performance indicators and actual methodologies.\nWe also recognize that companies are learning from their peers and like their public sector counterparts have begun to see the benefit in building stronger community relations, fostering employee engagement, and continuous learning.\nWe must expand our often \u201cUN-centric\u201d communications and provide the basic understanding of the goals to a larger network, including those not traditionally working on the subject of development or the global goals. This requires some fresh thinking.\nGiven the complexities of the agenda, for example with the multitude of targets and indicators, we must break it down and offer concrete and hands-on examples of projects and areas for collaboration. We must work harder to demonstrate the value proposition for implementing the goals.\nMore broadly\u2013 how can the UN help the public and private sector understand the nuances and complexities of what is considered the new 2030 Agenda? Quite simply, there are numerous areas where individuals and business can benefit. What are some of the solutions or best practices for building partnerships\u2013 especially at global and national levels?\nThere seems to be no better time to truly highlight the compelling story of the SDGs\u2019 especially their intrinsic value and how the SDGs can be turned into public"}

To restore the \u201cnatural order\u201d of the planet, Hitler believed, Jews had to be eliminated, and to eliminate them he first had to render them stateless by absorbing or overrunning the countries where they lived. \u201cThe German destruction of neighbouring states,\u201d Snyder writes, \u201ccreated zones where ... techniques of annihilation could be invented.\u201d In this excerpt from his book, Snyder writes about pre-war Poland, where Jews made up about a tenth of the population, and proposals to reduce the numbers of European Jews through mass immigration to Palestine or even Madagascar.\nNaturally, there were Polish spies in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, some of them on a rather unusual assignment. On June 8, 1935, Polish military intelligence ordered its officers in Soviet Ukraine to make tours of all the battlefields of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1919-1920. Their task was not to prepare some new campaign, but to commemorate a past one. Jozef Pilsudski (the former revolutionary and leader of Poland since 1926) had died the month before, and a small bag of earth from each of the battle sites was to be discreetly gathered for his burial mound.\nThe end of a political life reopened the issue of the character of the Polish state. Pilsudski\u2019s authority had been personal, and the old comrades (\u201cthe colonels\u201d) who wished to succeed him had to contend with popular politics at a time of economic depression. Pilsudski\u2019s old enemies, the National Democrats, chose to exploit popular anti-Semitism to mount a challenge to the regime that his associates established after his death. Their encouragement of pogroms, at the same time an act of racism and a violation of the law, was understood by both sides as an attack on the state.\nThe new regime enjoyed greater formal powers than had Pilsudski himself, since it exploited an authoritarian constitution that had been conceived while he was still alive. Although most of his successors were not anti-Semitic by conviction themselves, they tried to ride out the challenge from the National Democrats by adopting anti-Semitic public policy. In so doing, Pilsudski\u2019s successors compromised the basic moral premise of his politics: that Poland was a state and not a race.\nIn 1935, responsibility for Jewish affairs was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Jews were no longer normal citizens to be integrated and protected by the state, but somehow aliens: a matter for the world at large, objects whose future might be negotiated with foreign officials. Pilsudski\u2019s electoral organization, which had been popular with Jews, was replaced by a party of power which excluded them.\nThis new Camp of National Unity (Oboz Zjednoczenia Narodowego, OZON), created in 1937, announced its preference for the emigration of about 90 per cent of Poland\u2019s Jews.

Neither the sweeping war movie nor the action film its title and its marketing suggests, Basterds is more of a talky drama which just happens to have a lot of Swastikas in it.\nInglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Crash. Neither the sweeping war movie nor the action film its title and its marketing suggests, Basterds is more of a talky drama about a variety of coincidentally connected characters living separate lives which just happen to have a lot of Swastikas in them. Sure Tarantino occasionally indulges in the gory brutality that is his trademark, but only when one of his characters stops talking long enough to take a breath. They don\u2019t take many breaths. That\u2019s fortunate since brilliant babbling distracts from the movie\u2019s lack of narrative. When his ciphers are dishing you\u2019re too busy reveling in the intense exchange of threats, ideas, and ruminations to notice that the film abandoned most of its cast half an hour ago for no particular reason.\nIt plays out like a series of vignettes in which different archetypes are forced to deal with the Nazi occupation in different ways. For some its survival, for others its revenge. Ok ultimately it\u2019s all about revenge, but this is not the story of a group of hard-bitten, bloodthirsty Jewish-American soldiers sent behind enemy lines to wreak havoc on every Nazi in sight. Aside from the occasional scalping, we never see any of that. Yes Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a part-Apache American soldier leading a group of Nazi killers called the Basterds, and yes they terrorize occupied territory by slaughtering SS officers. It all happens off camera. The Basterds only show up when they have something to say or when Tarantino needs a warm body to stand between someone else and a gun fight. They are one minor component in a movie filled with different, mostly unrelated characters whose lives may or may not become intertwined for a big fiery finale which is meant to, even if it sort of makes a mess of it, bring the whole thing together.\nStill there\u2019s revenge. Separate characters living separate lives stand around and talk about how they\u2019re going to get it or how they\u2019ve gotten it. Raine and his men take the direct approach, killing Nazis and carving swastikas in the heads of the ones they leave alive. Or there\u2019s Shoshanna, a Jewish girl hiding in plain sight at a Paris movie theater playing German propaganda films, and letting her Nazi hate simmer as she lives and relives every horrible injustice she\u2019s suffered.\nIf there\u2019s a main character in this story it\u2019s Col.

{"idx": "24228", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: So, it may come as some surprise to many of you that Stratus Technologies - one of the venerable vendors of fault tolerant servers for commercial applications - is now trying to get its x64-based ftServer machinery into supercomputer sites, thanks to the charge of Microsoft into the high performance computing arena with its Windows HPC Server 2008 edition.\nHere's the deal. Fault tolerant servers are really aimed at commercial transaction processing - and they're meant for the kinds of workloads where a system crash is a big problem. (Think banking transactions - if you can bear to think of such things right now). Tandem and Stratus were two of the early sellers of fault tolerant servers, the latter being a big partner of IBM and the former having disappeared into Compaq more than a decade ago and now part of Hewlett-Packard.\nStratus doesn't make its own processors and systems any more, like it did in the old days, but it does take Xeon servers from Japanese partner NEC and then equip them with chipsets and firmware that allows for the absolute lockstepping of applications running on two distinct physical machines. These machines are identically configured, including identical processors, memory, disks, and such, and they can provide 99.999 per cent uptime for Windows or Linux operating systems.\nSupercomputer centers haven't generally worried about fault tolerance, basically because they have much larger issues to worry about concerning their Linux and, Microsoft hopes, Windows clusters. There are a lot of ways to lash together server nodes to create parallel supercomputers, which are used to model everything from car crashes to the weather to nuclear explosions to the interaction of subatomic particles on an absurdly small scale and the Universe on the large scale.\nThe typical parallel supercomputer today uses a protocol called Message Passing Interface, or MPI, to link server nodes together so they can pass information between the nodes. This information passing is necessary since calculations that define a simulated state in a region within that simulation - say a 3D chunk of air in the atmosphere - depend on the state of the regions that surround it. So, in simulating stuff, parallel supercomputers chop the job up into pieces, model what's going on in those pieces and their interactions, and show how the whole system changes over time based on initial conditions.\nWhile parallel supercomputer clusters have lots of clustering for scalability, they do not generally scale for high availability. This could be done, and in fact, Microsoft and Stratus will be making the argument that for key nodes in an HPC cluster, it should be done.\nThis is something of a surprise position for Stratus to be taking, and the company is up front about it. \"Generally, Stratus has had this aversion to clusters, and clusters have been the enemy when it comes to availability,\" explains Denny Lane, director of product and marketing management at Stratus.\nAnd for commercial data processing, despite the headache of setting up and maintaining high availability clusters, which have one server's applications switch over to a backup set of servers in the event of a failure on the primary machine, there is an order of magnitude (or two) difference in adoption of HA clusters over fault tolerant machines out there in the data center. Lane said that Stratus had sold 10,000 fault tolerant servers worldwide. The world consumes more than 8 million servers a year.\nAccording to Lane, Microsoft approached Stratus with the idea that the marriage of key nodes in a supercomputing cluster running Windows HPC Server (which manage the workloads running on the cluster and access to the nodes) with fault tolerance like that provided by"}

They\u2019re also not as good as they could be, say some experts.\nThe simplicity is attractive to many, but higher fees and lower returns should be considered when deciding where to invest your retirement savings.\nYou're saving for retirement, and the first thing you see is a list of fund names.\nSome people freeze and put off choosing. Others look for a simple approach.\nIf you are in a workplace retirement plan, you may be automatically placed into an investment known as a target-date fund. You can usually recognize these because the fund names all end in a year that's supposed to correspond with your retirement age.\n\"Target-date funds tend to be very attractive to investors who don't want to consistently manage their investments,\" said J. Kevin Stophel, a certified financial planner at the advisory firm Kumquat. \"But consumers [generally] do too little homework when selecting a particular fund.\"\nInstead of picking a bunch of funds and trying to balance between stocks, bonds, international and domestic, a target-date fund is more like one-stop shopping.\nYou invest in it fully, without having to think about your asset allocation. They're attractive to investors who don't want to have to pay too much attention to managing their investments.\nThese funds are created to automatically rebalance to an investment allocation that grows more conservative as one gets closer to retirement or the target date, Stophel says.\nThe asset allocation generally starts out more aggressive, since the investor has several decades until retirement and can ride out some bumps in the market. The nearer to retirement, the more conservative the mix of investments.\nEven though target-date funds are advertised as a hands-off investment for people who don't want to fuss, it's still important to research the investment company and the expense ratios. You'll want to know how much you are paying for convenience. Another thing to look at: How the target-date fund is rebalanced through the years.\nAs an all-in-one investment, these funds are pretty good, says Nick Holeman, a CFP with Betterment for Business, the robo-advisor. \"They're also not as good as they could be,\" Holeman said.\nHoleman dislikes several aspects of target-date funds. There's too much time between fund dates to give a truly customized experience. A 26-year-old might be in a fund set for a 2055, but what if this employee hopes to retire several years earlier or later? They're also biased toward their own funds. If you're in a Fidelity target-date, you're investing only in Fidelity funds.\n\"They handle the investments, but retirement planning is so much more than just investments,\" Holeman said. \"They won't tell you if you're saving enough or if the risk tolerance is right for you.\"\n\"When you're younger, the default of a target-date fund might be all you need to get started,\" Holeman said.\nBut more mature investors might be interested in a little more detail, which would allow you to better match your risk tolerance.\nThese funds assume everyone has the same risk tolerance and life expectancy, says Holeman.\n\"But the risk tolerance in that fund might not match your own comfort level,\" Holeman said. \"If it seems a little risky for you, you can choose [a different year].\n\"That shorter time horizon could mean a slightly less aggressive approach,\" he added.\nYou might want"}

Near the top of the hour, CNN host George Howell threw it over to CNN legal analyst Areva Martin. Howell, operating under the assumption that Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed, asked the legal analyst to break down what the possible impact might be on upcoming cases the court will handle.\nIf you were expecting any sort of unbiased example of pending cases which might be closely divided you were about to be sorely disappointed. Martin launched into a scenario based on gerrymandering cases, frequently brought by Democrats challenging district maps drawn up by state Republican parties. She then reminded viewers of Kavanaugh\u2019s emotional testimony after Christine Blasey Ford addressed the committee. She went on to ask if Kavanaugh believes that the witch hunt against him was organized by Democratic operatives, can he judge gerrymandering cases brought by state Democratic parties fairly? Let\u2019s go to the video. It starts at this point in the conversation and only runs for a few minutes.\nFrom there, unprompted by the host, Martin spins off into an explanation of how nobody can force a Supreme Court Justice to recuse themselves. But would Kavanaugh be willing to do it? It\u2019s a fairly remarkable position to take, even in the fractured partisan battlefield of 2018. In the vast majority of cases the court hears, there will be one side or the other supported by the Democrats and Republicans. The gerrymandering issue is only one small piece of that much larger puzzle. Whether it\u2019s abortion, gun rights, Title IX, Obamacare or immigration, there\u2019s an obvious conservative and liberal \u201cside\u201d in the battle.\nSo what Areva Martin is suggesting is that because of his exclamations aimed specifically at Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh should sit out virtually every case coming before the court. She concludes by repeating the Democratic talking point we\u2019ve heard from the beginning, suggesting that there should be \u201can asterisk\u201d next to every case that Kavanaugh votes on in a 5-4 decision.\nWas this supposed to be a \u201clegal analysis\u201d or a partisan broadside? It\u2019s understandable when CNN has on a member of the DNC or RNC to comment and they wind up spewing party talking points. That\u2019s pretty much their job. But it seems as if the job title of \u201clegal analyst\u201d has little meaning these days. Of course, when you do a bit of checking into Martin\u2019s background you quickly discover that she\u2019s hardly a neutral figure in the nation\u2019s political wars. Particularly when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, check out these recent tweets from Martin.\nAs #BrettKavanuagh moves closer to being confirmed despite the thousands of law professors, judges & experts who say he is unfit, will GOP Senators who vote yes pay a hefty price at the ballot box for confirming him to the Sup Court? My take on @HLN and @CNN throughout the day.\nIn addition to peppering her Twitter feed with Democratic talking points, check out the text of a speech she gave opposing Kavanaugh on September 7th. This was the final day of Kavanaugh\u2019s initial confirmation hearings, five days before Feinstein would send Ford\u2019s confidential letter to the FBI and nine days before the rest of the world would even learn her name. And she was already sounding the alarm about how horrible Kavanaugh would be as a Supreme Court Associate Justice."}

Sometimes the thieves put a device into your ATM or department store cash register and steal your identifying information. It can even happen when you buy gas. Recovering from the theft and damage to your credit can be a nightmare. Imagine how overwhelming it is when the victim is your aging parent. Finally the government is offering a tool to help you. This is particularly good for assisting seniors who may not be so savvy with the internet. IdentityTheft.gov is clear, simple and offers a step by step plan. This was just announced by the Federal Trade Commission and in reviewing it, I am happily surprised. I am not normally a fan of how government agencies explain to consumers how to do things. To me government sites are not generally created with the clearest and simplest way of communicating with the public. This one, however, is different.\nHere's how it works. You or your aging parent, if computer literate, signs on to IdentifyTheft.com. The site walks the user through a sign in and then gives you instruction as to what to do first. That is to call the companies where the fraud occurred. One would of course see where the out of line charges were on your credit card statement or any other bill that is wrong. It tells you to ask them to freeze the accounts. You then change all logins, passwords and PINS for these accounts.\nFollowing that, the site instructs the user how to place a fraud alert on your credit report and tells you how to get a free credit report. The next step is to report the identity theft to the FTC and it gives you an online form to fill out. The system then creates an Identity Theft Affidavit for you. Finally, the program instructs you to file a local police report, tells you what you need to take with you to do so and offers you an online memo form to give to law enforcement which you can also use.\nThe issue of identity theft is particularly traumatic for our elders, as they can be easily overwhelmed by the impact of theft, the fraudulent charges they see on their bills and the long process of trying to correct the fraud. Often, their adult children or others in their lives must help them. Even seniors who use the internet may not be thoroughly adept at filling out online forms, and following all the steps electronic reporting entails. At least this site and tool from the FTC can be helpful to anyone. I hope identity theft never happens to you, nor anyone in your life. But as it's out there in force, you know you have a straightforward way to address it, using a free tool the feds have created. It can't fix every issue but it will give you a solid start to recovery after such theft. You will have standardized, credible forms to use to fight back. An aging parent would be empowered to get things corrected with the use of IdentityTheft.gov.\nIn my work at AgingInvestor.com & AgingParents.com, I consult with families with aging parents every day and some are indeed victimized by identity theft. I am comfortable showing them this tool and I hope you, too will pass this on to anyone you know who may need it."}

Today, Pachelbel is best known for the Canon in D, as well as the Chaconne in F minor, the Toccata in E minor for organ, and the Hexachordum Apollinis, a set of keyboard variations.\nHe was influenced by southern German composers, such as Johann Jakob Froberger and Johann Caspar Kerll, Italians such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Alessandro Poglietti, French composers, and the composers of the Nuremberg tradition. He preferred a lucid, uncomplicated contrapuntal style that emphasized melodic and harmonic clarity. His music is less virtuosic and less adventurous harmonically than that of Dieterich Buxtehude, although, like Buxtehude, Pachelbel experimented with different ensembles and instrumental combinations in his chamber music and, most importantly, his vocal music, much of which features exceptionally rich instrumentation.

Forty-eight percent of all Americans feel that a smile is the most memorable feature after first meeting someone.\nWhile smiling is important, you probably don't want to have a cheesy and inauthentic grin plastered across your face.

Even a small grin can go a long way.\nNot only does smiling make others feel more comfortable around you, but it also decreases stress hormones that can negatively impact your health. This isn't according to just one or two studies; smiling is highly correlated with longevity.\nSince the need to make a positive first impression can increase your stress level, smiling is a way to take the edge off.\nThe handshake is accepted internationally as a professional sign of politeness.

If you have a hard time remembering names, the intro is a great place to reinforce the name of the person you just met.\nIt doesn't have to be too involved: when your contact says, \"Hi, I'm Amelia,\" reply with a simple, \"Great to meet you, Amelia.

It also conveys a sense of interest in the conversation; likewise, looking away too much will make you appear distracted.\nLike with most things, it's a good idea to not overdo it; if you don't take breaks now and again, your eye contact could be viewed as staring, which has negative connotations.\nOne interesting thing about human psychology: most of us instinctively mirror each other's body language.\nThink about how infectious a yawn is"}

Authorities offered few other details, allowing only that Stewart was not a patient or an employee at the nursing home, and isn't believe to be related to any of the victims.\n\"It's a horrible event in any size town, particularly, though, when you deal with a small town such as Carthage,\" police chief Chris McKenzie said. \"It's hard.

To now be the champion ... 22 years between wins [first Masters victory and this one] is a long time. It's unreal to experience this.\"\nHe lost his health to four back surgeries that left him unable to get out of bed, much less swing a club, and he went two years without even playing a major.

At that time, he thought his career was over.\n\"Now I'm the dad with two kids there,\" he said.\nHe wanted his children to see him win, once saying they saw him only as a YouTube legend.

The following weekend, Griffin showed out at an event in Kansas City. Soon Illinois, Pitt and Kansas entered the fray with offers, and as we know, he committed to the Cyclones in September.\nGriffin's rise in the recruiting world was remarkable. He was a fringe mid-major prospect before July, and a Bill Self target by August. Some of that boils down to luck \u2014 playing your best at the right time in front of the right people.\nMore than anything, though, Griffin's profile blossomed as a result of offseason work on one glaring hole in his game: He developed a 3-point shot.\n\"In college, nobody wants a 6-foot-5, 6-foot-6 center,\" Griffin told the Register before practice at Hinsdale South on Tuesday. \"So I\u2019m like, 'I\u2019ve got to do something to get out of the center spot.'

So I\u2019m like, 'I\u2019ve got to get in the gym, put up as many reps as I can in a day until it gets consistent.'\"\nGriffin earned trickles of college interest as a junior, averaging 17.3 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. But despite his obvious athleticism and defensive range, his ceiling was lower with an offensive arsenal that only extended to the midrange. In essence, he projected as an undersized big.\nTo go about developing a Division I-ready 3-pointer, Griffin got technical. After his junior season of high school wrapped up, he broke down film of his 3-pointers and realized three things: His form was fine and he elevated well, but he rarely put enough on his shot.\nA spring full of trips to the weight room helped fix that.

They're digging out basements to create underground mansions \u2014 often to neighbors' dismay.\nYou know, when homeowners add onto a house, they usually build out or maybe up. They could add a floor. But there are some places in the world where cities have no room for houses to grow. And so there's only one option, and that is to dig down. NPR's Robert Smith reports from London on a new subterranean building boom.\nJOHN COYLE: You'd be surprised what's underground (laughter).\nROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Above us is a street of narrow London townhouses. Down here, it is the Wal-Mart of basements.\nThis is huge. I mean, look at how tall the ceilings are down here.\nIt is still under construction. It has been for nine months. The contractor, John Coyle, walks me through what is to come.\nCOYLE: I just wanted to give you an idea of the scale of it.\nSMITH: Bedroom, bathroom, another bedroom, utility room, a home theater.\nCOYLE: So this will be - this will be the cinema room here. This will be a big projector and a screen on that wall.\nSMITH: I have literally been in movie theaters smaller than this room.\nSMITH: I'm guessing reclining leather chairs?\nSMITH: It's not just that the English love to sit in dark, damp spaces. This basement boom is happening because wealthy Londoners feel like they have no other option. The most fashionable neighborhoods here feature these really narrow houses. And historic restrictions make it hard to add anything that you can see from the street. And so the engineers start digging. Some residential streets in London have had dozens of basements dug out. There's even a name for them, iceberg houses, bigger below the ground than above.\nCOYLE: Where we're standing now, it wouldn't be unusual to have another staircase down to a swimming pool.\nSMITH: It is a simple calculation. London real estate is so expensive that adding any extra space is worth the money. This basement right here costs $1.8 million to build. It will probably add $3 million to the value of the home. Usually, you can double your money. Of course, things do go wrong. Tim Chapman is a subterranean engineer with Arup consultants. He's dug some of the biggest holes in the city. And he says once you go down in an old place like London, you can find anything - underground rivers, sewer pipes, Roman ruins, old train tunnels.\nIs there any dirt left under London?\nTIM CHAPMAN: You're quite right. I mean, there's a huge amount of things underground in London. Every decade, we add a new tube line. People are putting in new fiber optic cables. And no one takes any of these things away. So it's a form of pollution.\nSMITH: Find a human bone or a piece of pottery, and suddenly your new basement project can take twice as long. And then there are the neighbors. If you're rich enough to build a million-dollar basement, your neighbor is probably rich enough to get a lawyer. Chapman is often hired as an expert consultant in these cases. And"}

He won his first commission right out of high school, \u201ca 132-foot-tall wheat sculpture\u201d that still graces the offices of the High Plains Journal.\nDespite creating steadily since those days, Haley admits that \u201cI\u2019ve only been able to say, comfortably, for the past five years that I\u2019m an artist.\u201d He still doesn\u2019t say it loudly. He doesn\u2019t dress in artistic solid black. He does not drive a hip, vintage car.\nHaley began casting and welding the pieces that constitute the bulk of Gravity back in January, during the buildup to the war in Iraq. By April, as the war began to wind down, he was working on the exhibit full time: Assembling tidy rows of cast-concrete houses. Painting eerily similar houses on the flat horizons of sheets of rusting, enamel-coated metal. Soldering strips of steel into neat spheres that, the artist comments, are \u201clike perfectly trimmed bushes\u201d dotting the surreal suburban sameness represented by the rest of the exhibit.\n\u201cOnly now can I look back and see what was going on in my mind,\u201d he reveals.\nAnd yet, he continues: \u201cA lot of people are still hanging onto that dream, and the more it\u2019s not possible, the more they hang onto it.

That\u2019s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)\u2014a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.\nThe hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.\nClose to 800,000 Americans have a stroke each year and estimates suggest about half of those people will be disabled from it. With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.\n\u201cDespite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,\u201d said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.\nAnd inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren\u2019t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson\u2019s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity\u2014and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.\nIf all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest\u2014the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain\u2019s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.\nThe team will focus on people who suffer ischemic strokes, which is when blood flow to the brain is blocked.

The film is called The Lobby USA, but it has never been released. That\u2019s because the Israeli government and the Israel lobby pressured Qatar to censor it.

{"idx": "24282", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If you stop and think about it, if the Democrats allow the Republicans to pass a bill that will make vouchers available all across America, that could create a huge political problem for the Democrats at the next election and for years thereafter.\nFirst of all, vouchers would alienate one of the Democrats\u2019 biggest financial contributors, the teachers\u2019 unions. These unions also supply much manpower and phone banks to get out the votes on election nights. Losing their support would be a huge loss.\nThen there is the support of blacks, who are the group that votes most dependably and most overwhelmingly for Democrats. But what if a Republican-sponsored bill creates vouchers that allow black children to escape the terrible schools that so many attend?\nSince voucher schools will not have to accept hoodlums, they will tend to be safer places, even if the education they offer is no better. But studies have already indicated there are better educational results as well.\nNot all black parents will send their children to private schools with their vouchers, and not all those that do will vote Republican at the next election. But once it becomes apparent that vouchers offer some escape from the worst schools, word is going to spread. Moreover, Republicans can point out Democrats fought against vouchers, tooth and nail, for years.\nThis does not mean most blacks would vote Republican. Chances are the Democrats would continue to win a majority of the black votes for some time to come. But, in a country as evenly divided politically as America is today, Democrats could be ruined if their current 90 percent of the black vote erodes to 75 percent. Democrats are already in trouble among white voters, so they need every black vote they can get to offset that.\nIn short, giving the Republicans a victory on vouchers could mean giving them many victories in future elections, where the difference between winning and losing is a few percentage points. That includes elections for president of the United States.\nWhatever the shortcomings of politicians, they can count votes. Sometimes that is all they can do or want to do.\nWhat about the future of a whole generation of young blacks? Not even the Congressional Black Caucus puts that ahead of maintaining political support from the teachers\u2019 unions.\nHere and there isolated individuals within the Democratic Party have apparently let concern for the future of the next generation of blacks cause them to back off from their opposition to vouchers. D.C.\u2019s mayor Anthony Williams is one of these. So is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat.\nOne of the tragedies of the public schools is they have become so enmeshed in bureaucratic rules and constrained by court decisions they can do little to prevent a handful of classroom clowns and hoodlums from making it virtually impossible to educate other students in many ghetto schools.\nPrivate schools, and to some extent charter schools, escape these rigidities. Teachers\u2019 unions and others in the education establishment say it is \u201cunfair\u201d that public schools have to compete with other institutions that do not have these and other bureaucratic and legal handicaps.\nThe greatest unfairness today is denying a decent education to poor children, for whom it is often their only way out of poverty."}

Verizon has vowed to deploy 5G to wireless customers in as many as 30 cities by the end of the year. Meanwhile, AT&T has targeted \u201cat least 21 major cities\u201d for its rollout. And T-Mobile has said it plans a nationwide network by 2020, starting with low-frequency airwaves that can travel farther than the high-frequency technology being used by AT&T and Verizon.\nPressure to be the \u201cfirst\u201d to 5G has resulted in a massive marketing war. Last year, Verizon said it was the first to deliver a form of 5G to consumers but only as a replacement for in-home broadband. AT&T had also said it was switching on its 5G wireless network in certain markets but only for select customers \u2014 and accessing the network required the use of a mobile hotspot.\nMeanwhile, Sprint sued AT&T this year for promoting \u201c5G Evolution,\u201d which Sprint said risked misleading consumers into thinking 5G was truly available when AT&T\u2019s network is, in fact, offering an upgraded version of existing 4G mobile data technology. AT&T this year began to replace the \u201cLTE\u201d icons on some smartphones with a \u201c5G E\u201d icon, saying it showed how AT&T was on the path toward 5G.\nT-Mobile and Sprint have made 5G a central part of their argument for a $26 billion merger, claiming that together the two companies will be able to build a better 5G network than they could individually.\nSprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure told Congress recently that without a merger, his company could be forced to borrow money to build out its 5G network, adding costs that would be passed to customers. But opponents of the merger say the deal would ultimately give the combined company greater power to raise prices anyway, despite a three-year moratorium on price hikes T-Mobile has offered regulators to sweeten the deal.

Different varieties mature at different rates, offer varied fruit sizes and flesh characteristics and may or may not be seedless. Regardless of the watermelon variety growing in your garden, it is alarming when nearly mature fruits split open on the vine or ripe fruits split open during handling.\nWatermelon vines require a lot of water to grow and produce quality fruit, but if water is supplied incorrectly it can lead to splitting. Fruit split is caused by an erratic watering pattern, particularly excessive irrigation or rainfall during the last two weeks of growth. The excessive moisture causes a great deal of pressure on the inside of the fruit, which will split open with even slight tapping or during normal harvesting. Watermelons benefit from deep, occasional waterings that wet the top 6 inches of soil with each irrigation and supply a total of 1 to 2 inches of water weekly. As fruits ripen, reducing the amount of water supplied will improve fruit flavor. Some cultivars might be more prone to splitting than others.\nRyczkowski, Angela. \"What Causes Watermelons to Split Before Maturity?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/causes-watermelons-split-before-maturity-81763.html.

The reclusive writer, who moved to Seattle in 1999 from her native Southern California, was a giant in stature (she was 6 feet tall by age 15) and in accomplishment.\nShe remains the only science fiction writer to receive one of the vaunted \"genius grants\" from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, a hard-earned $295,000 windfall in 1995 that followed years of poverty and personal struggles with shyness and self-doubt.\n\"People may call these 'genius grants,' \" Butler said in a 2004 interview with the Seattle P-I, \"but nobody made me take an IQ test before I got mine. I knew I'm no genius.\"\nButler's most popular work is \"Kindred,\" a time-travel novel in which a black woman from 1976 Southern California is transported back to the violent days of slavery before the Civil War. The 1979 novel became a popular staple of school and college courses and now has more than a quarter million copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so much in Butler's solitary life.\n\"Kindred\" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of whom could not understand how a science fiction novel could be set on a plantation in the antebellum South. Butler stuck to her social justice vision - \"I think people really need to think what it's like to have all of society arrayed against you\" - and finally found a publisher who paid her a $5,000 advance for \"Kindred.\"\n\"I was living on my writing,\" Butler said, \"and you could live on $5,000 back then.

The triumphant former beautician had just won the cross-country race, completing the 2,042 miles from Los Angeles to Cleveland in just eight hours, ten minutes and thirty-one seconds. Using an innovative, new fuel system, she chalked up another first by becoming the first pilot to finish the course non-stop. Within a year Cochran was awarded, for the second time, the most prestigious prize given to American women aviators: the women's Harmon trophy. She'd also broken a women's altitude record, climbing to 33,000 feet, and she'd broken several speed records. When Cochran was asked what fueled her ambitions she would reply: \"I might have been born in a hovel, but I determined to travel with the wind and the stars.\"\nCochran's earliest memories are of life with a foster family on what she called \"Sawdust Road,\" but what was, in fact, a lumber mill town in northern Florida. In her autobiography she remembered having no shoes until she was eight years old, sleeping on a pallet on the floor and wearing dresses made of cast-off flour sacks. As a child she was hired by a beauty shop owner, and by the time she was 13, she was cutting hair professionally. In the 1920s she became one of the first women to master the newly invented permanent wave. But one of the customers, noting Cochran's spark, encouraged her to do something more serious with her life. With very little formal education, Cochran enrolled in nursing school.\nEven though Cochran completed three years of training to be a nurse, she never quite adjusted to the profession. In her autobiography, she remembers not ever getting \"comfortable with the sight of blood.\" She constantly had to resist the urge to hand in her notice, reminding herself that a nurse was more valuable than a beautician. But she was never convinced, and an experience delivering a baby to an impoverished mother in Florida helped drive her back to the beauty trade. She remembered three children were sleeping on pallets next to the woman giving birth. \"There I was with neither the strength nor the money to do the smallest fraction of what needed to be done to make those lives better... . In a beauty shop the customers always came in looking for a lift. And unless I really screwed up,\" she concluded, \"they left with that lift.\"\nHer next job as a beautician at Antoine's in New York's Saks Fifth Avenue brought Cochran into her future husband's world. At a dinner in 1932, the dashing millionaire financier Floyd Bostwick Odlum advised Cochran that if she were ever to realize her dream of setting up her own cosmetics firm, she'd need wings to cover enough territory to beat her competition. Cochran took the advice to heart, and that summer she learned to fly. \"At that moment, when I paid for my first lesson,\" Cochran remembered later, \"a beauty operator ceased to exist and an aviator was born.\"\nIt wasn't until the end of the decade, after Cochran had established herself as America's leading female pilot, that she tried to turn her new profession into one in which she could make a vital contribution to her country.

Could it be as simple as redesigning existing pasture dams to have drain down tubes installed?\nThe 8 inch to 12 inch tubes would allow water from rainfall events to slowly drain out of the pasture dams and make its way to the Republican River.\nNote: This solution does not remove any of the pasture dams, as they provide a valuable service for us, it only redesigns them. The tubes can be set an elevation that allows water to remain for livestock, wildlife, its. This solution also does not require additional costs after installation; if it rains, the water flows to the river.\nIn my opinion, given the Compact language of Article XI, the Compact states should demand that the United States install these draindown tubes. Almost all of these pasture dams were built after the Compact was signed. They were designed, built to federal specs and paid for entirely or on a cost-share basis through a variety of federal agencies. The dams hold back water, which decreases streamflow, which interferes with the full beneficial consumptive use of the waters within the basin.\nThe Compact states were utilizing the waters of the basin for beneficial consumptive use through irrigation from the resource.\nThe United States, through the federal agencies, interfered with that use when they installed the dams that interfered with streamflows. The installation of the draindown tubes will help decrease that interference and help restore streamflows.\nThis solution will help in several ways. Any additional water that is measured at a river gauge is added into the formulas for compact compliance. The evaporation from some pasture dams is counted in the formulas for compact compliance. If the water flows through, there is no evaporation to calculate. Additional streamflow also will help to keep the river channel free of debris.\nThe Republican River Basin is a 24,900-square-mile watershed, almost 16 million acres. The water draining from one pasture dam may not amount to very much, but the water draining from a large percentage of the dams located on 16 million acres will.\nAt a meeting I attended they showed aerial photos that vividly illustrated the amount of water being held back by pasture dams and terraces after a heavy rain.\nIf this aerial photo was worth a thousand words, we need to know how many thousands of acre feet of water will be added to the Republican River if that water in the pasture dams is allowed to flow to the river.\nI would hope that some research will be done on the feasibility of this proposed solution. Perhaps some drainage areas that drain to the locations of the gauges on the Republican River could be done as a pilot program. More streamflow at the river gauges provides us with the best chance of helping to achieve Compact compliance.\nDale, what have you been smoking?????????\nYou have got to be kidding!!"}

As part of the study, the researchers, Janet Schwartz of Tulane University\u2019s A.B. Freeman School of Business and Adriana Samper of Arizona State University, gave two groups of people two different flu shot prices, $25 and $125.\nThey found that consumers associated lower medication prices with a greater communal need and, therefore, a greater sense of personal risk and they associated higher prices with less need and less risk. The potential implication: consumers may forgo more expensive medication and procedures on the false belief that they\u2019re less important.\nAs consumer advocates, policy experts and a growing group of startups try to open up the black box of health care costs, it\u2019s an interesting study to keep in mind. And the authors argue that more education about risk and need should accompany price transparency efforts.\nComparison shopping in health care is still in its earliest days, but sites like Castlight Health, ClearCost Health, Clear Health Costs, HealthInReach and PokitDok are trying to give consumers more clarity into health care pricing. Getting the data straight from the providers is tricky (although PokitDok and HealthInReach attempt to do this) but using claims data, many of these sites try to provide consumers with the spectrum of price options for a given procedure or visit.\nAnd some already try to give consumers more context \u2013 such as physician ratings, outcome data when available and patient reviews. That information may not necessarily give patients more insight into their risk around a particular kind of medication or procedure, but it\u2019s a start.\nUntil all purchasers of health services pay the same price for the same service, all the data in the world will remain useless. My health insurance company typically pays 40% of the stated price on the billing from the care provider. Individuals will never get that favored pricing, so they will never have a sound basis for decision making, or indeed, the ability to make sound decisions at all. If you only have $25, it doesn\u2019t matter how safe you want to be. If you can not afford $125 for a vaccine, you will not pay it.\nEverybody needs health care. Nobody needs health insurance. We need a system that provides care for everyone, manages costs equitably and doesn\u2019t see anyones illness as a profit center.\nGood article on the future of health care consumerism! 2 points of clarification. Castlight Health works with employers. It is the most robust transparency platform mentioned, but unless your employer has a contract with them, you can\u2019t use their service. Okcopay is probably the largest provider of health pricing yet they are not mentioned here.\nInteresting findings \u2013 price perception now has another element which is \u201crisk\u201d as you say \u2013 this is similar to price perception where low prices are sometimes associated with low quality.

Not since Jerry Brown in 1992 has a candidate come into the convention with an agenda for changing the Democratic Party. Howard Dean had his 50-state strategy, but his reforms were not as transformative as Bernie's.\nThe battle for the soul of the Democratic Party has begun. If Hillary Clinton is smart, she will not attempt to stop Bernie's reforms. 2016 is about changing the status quo. If the political revolution is ignored by the party establishment in Philadelphia this July, many Sanders supporters will vote third party or stay home in November.\nThose who are calling for Bernie to drop out and campaign for Hillary Clinton don't understand what the Sanders campaign is all about. Bernie and his supporters want to change the system. They are tired of a rigged political process. It would be a mistake for them to surrender now without putting up a fight for change.\nThe Democratic Party establishment should be listening. The lesson they should have learned from this year's election is that they have lost touch with a significant portion of their base and Independents. Bernie's success should be seen as a wake-up call. Reforming the party with Bernie's guidance will go a long way toward rebuilding trust with Democratic and Independent voters.\nToo many voters feel both parties are bought and paid for by the one percent. The political revolution is about changing that. It is not enough to pay lip service to political reform. The Sanders army will need to see real action before they will commit to supporting the party again.\nHere are some actions that will go along way toward rejuvenating the Democratic Party.\n1. A new Democratic Party chair. A progressive leader must replace Debbie Wasserman Shultz as DNC chair. Her actions throughout the entire campaign have been undemocratic. Her handling of the debate schedule and threat to enforce one of the most undemocratic rules ever imposed by the party disqualifies her from a future leadership role in the party. To tell the candidates that they cannot participate in any debates not sanctioned by the party is authoritarian. Of course she didn't enforce the rule on Hillary Clinton, but she threatened to enforce it on Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders when they talked about organizing more debates. Wasserman Shultz was clearly attempting to shield Clinton from more debates.\nNow, out of roughly 60 spots on key committees at the convention, only three were chosen from lists submitted by the Sanders campaign. Bernie currently has an estimated 45% of the pledged delegates. The committee's make-up should reflect the results of the primaries and caucuses.\nAt last summer's meeting of the DNC there was a motion for more debates. Wasserman Shultz ruled that the motion was out of order and that it was her decision to make. She refused to allow a vote on the issue, drawing criticism from at least two vice chairs. One of them, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, was told by Wasserman Shultz to stay away from the Vegas debate if she couldn't stop talking about the need for more debates.\nAnother vice chair, former Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak, said Debbie Wasserman Schultz was making statements that were \"flat out not true\" and threatening the 2016 race.\n\"I have serious questions,\" Rybak said. \"And it's not just about the debates.

Symptoms, such as feeling tired or rundown (also called fatigue), are among the leading causes of disability for older adults.\nSometimes symptoms are directly caused by illness--for example, an aching chest can be a symptom associated with a heart attack. But often, symptoms have multiple causes. For example, fatigue can be a common symptom when you have conditions such as knee osteoarthritis, depression, and heart failure.\nUp until now, we haven't had much information about how symptoms that occur at the same time affect an older adult's ability to function. To learn more, a team of researchers recently examined information from a large study of older adults, the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), which included more than 7,500 participants aged 65 and older. The study was published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\nThe researchers also recorded measurements of the participants' grip strength, whether they walked slowly, their balance, and their ability to rise from a chair. They were also asked whether they had fallen one or more times in the last year.\nThe researchers also measured whether participants had any chronic diseases, whether they had an overnight hospital stay during the last year, and whether they had trouble performing their daily activities (such as getting in or out of bed, eating, toileting, bathing, and getting dressed). The researchers learned that 75 percent of older adults had at least one symptom and nearly half had two or more symptoms. They noted that nearly 14 percent--almost 5 million older adults in the U.S.--had four or more symptoms.\nSymptoms increased with older age.\nWomen were more likely to have more symptoms than men.\nCompared to white individuals, black and Hispanic participants had more symptoms. Older adults with lower levels of education had a higher number of symptoms than those with higher education levels.\nCurrent smoking, obesity, and an inactive lifestyle were also associated with a higher number of symptoms.\nParticipants who had a chronic medical condition, or multiple chronic conditions, also experienced more symptoms.\nImportantly, older adults who reported more symptoms had weaker grip strength and walked more slowly. Over time, older adults with more symptoms had an increased risk of falls, hospitalizations, disability, and mortality.\nWhile healthcare providers understand that treating symptoms is important to improving quality of life at the end-of-life (palliative care), there is less understanding about the best way to treat multiple symptoms that older adults experience.\nThe researchers said that their findings highlight the need for more research on symptoms in older adults to develop effective management strategies.\nInvolving in cultural activities like visiting the cinema or museum can prevent depression in old age, reveals a study.\nChildhood poverty has lasting effects on cognitive skills during old age. Cognitive skills include thinking, learning, remembering, reasoning, and problem solving."}

Since meetings of the Continental Congress had done so, and as the First Congress would create a chaplaincy and implement opening prayers in meetings of Congress, the Convention\u2019s decision is noteworthy.\nIn other words, somewhere along the line the decision was made not to open the Constitutional Convention with prayer, even though opening with prayer was typical for similar bodies at the time.\nWhile I\u2019ve seen conservatives cite Franklin\u2019s call for prayer many times, using it as evidence that the founding fathers were Christians who intended the United States to be a nation built on prayer, I\u2019ve never seen these same conservatives grapple with the absence of prayer Franklin\u2019s appeal for prayer suggests.\nDuring the darkest days of the Convention, Benjamin Franklin offered an eloquent motion noting the omission of prayers and recommending that they be instituted.\nTime and time again I have seen apologists for Christian America assume or deceitfully insinuate that Franklin\u2019s motion was well received and that the initiation of prayers in the Convention was the moment of breakthrough, resulting in a miraculous, God-blessed Constitution. In fact, a debate broke out over Franklin\u2019s motion and it was never voted upon.\nIn other words, the vast majority of the fifty-five delegates at the Constitutional Convention disagreed with Franklin\u2019s proposal, and no prayer was held.\nWhy was Franklin\u2019s proposal not acted on? We learn more in a paper by Louis Sirico, professor of law and legal writing. According to Sirico, Alexander Hamilton \u201cfeared the effect that adoption would have on those who were not privy to the Convention\u2019s deliberation.\u201d Namely, he worried that it might \u201clead the public to believe that the embarrassments and dissentions within the convention, had suggested this measure.\u201d Hugh Williamson, a former minister, noted that the Convention had no funds with which to pay a minister.\nThe Convention ultimately adjourned without voting on Franklin\u2019s proposal, though Franklin himself estimated, as noted above, that not more than a handful of delegates supported his proposal.\nThe differences of religious opinion within the Convention and the clergy of the area are easy to understand\u2014what is meant by the reference to the Quaker usage? Though the city had become more religiously diverse since the early 1700s, Philadelphia was originally dominated by Quakers. I am not an expert on Quaker religion, but I do know that Quakers have traditionally not had ministers or formal worship services.\nFranklin\u2019s proposal that the Convention invite a minister to open each session in prayer was not approved because (a) some feared approving such a proposal now would make the Convention look desperate; (b) there was no money to pay ministers; (c) there were religious differences among the delegates and the local clergy; and (d) the Quaker tradition still prominent in Philadelphia tended against public prayer by ministers.\nTrump, in his comments, referenced Franklin\u2019s proposal that the Constitutional Convention begin each day with prayer as part of a list of public appeals to or recognitions of God, offering it as evidence that this is a religious nation. Franklin, Trump said, \u201creminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer.\u201d And that much, I suppose, is true. What is not mentioned is that Franklin\u2019s colleagues rebuffed his proposal, and that the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention never did open with prayer."}

It was an extraordinarily rare live performance by the British musician Brian Williams, who has been recording as Lustmord since 1980 but has given only a handful of public concerts during his career, emerging for the Unsound Festival in Krakow, Poland, last year.\nLustmord has been a pioneer of what is generally called dark ambient music. It is textural rather than melodic, ultra-slow and submerged in bass and sub-bass frequencies, merging natural reverberations \u2014 Lustmord has recorded in crypts \u2014 with electronic ones. It opens abysses and lingers in them. When Lustmord got started it was associated with post-punk industrial music. Mr. Williams was a member in the 1980s of the Australian industrial group SPK and more recently has collaborated with the Melvins and Tool. While recording prolifically as Lustmord he has worked extensively as a sound designer in Hollywood, bringing ominous resonances to movie soundtracks.\nNow that equipment is portable enough to recreate and manipulate the sounds he assembled over the decades in the studio, a concert setting, free of distractions or interruptions and enveloped by the music, is ideal for Lustmord. Behind Mr. Williams and his laptop a screen showed images made by four video artists, changing in slow motion with computerized symmetries: smoke, clouds, flames, morphing three-dimensional white shapes, a circular kabbalah diagram. Subwoofers set the Henry Street auditorium shuddering.\nThe music moved at a tectonic pace, with its elements gradually welling up from subterranean depths. Within the drone and throb were deep Tibetan chants, orchestral strings, wordless choruses, distant howls, sustained synthesizer tones, dissonant buzzes, emerging and disappearing chords, and what might have been icebergs cracking, winds rushing, planes flying overhead and volcanoes erupting.\nThere was a pulse to the music, at first like the respiration of a sleeping leviathan and eventually with an established beat, created at first by a low repeating crash, like a tall tree falling. The music gradually accelerated to what would have been, in most concerts, the slowest dirge; a steady drumbeat surfaced, and eventually a syncopated one, only to disappear within a looming, buzzing drone. The last stretch of the music was marginally more conventional, with rushes of cymbals and hovering, Penderecki-like classical choirs. Another beat emerged, steady and industrial, with jackhammer sounds. But it, too, would be swallowed in rumble and drone, manmade music reverting to primordial sound."}

Here are five things you should know about Calgary\u2019s single-family market through the first two months of 2016.\nPeople selling single-family homes on the resale market have been busiest in three key ends of Calgary; the city\u2019s south, southeast and northwest areas. Citywide, sales were down nine per cent over the first two months of 2016 from a year earlier. But it\u2019s been a strong start for the city\u2019s south end, which led the first two months in resale with 264 deals on the books, says the Calgary Real Estate Board. Its most bustling neighbourhoods for sales were Evergreen and Chaparral with 22 and 21 transactions, respectively, year-to-date. Southeast Calgary followed with 189 sales and there were 163 in the northwest. The southeast\u2019s leaders in sales were master-planned communities by Brookfield Residential, with Auburn Bay at 33 and 28 in New Brighton. In the northwest, it was 26 for Tuscany and 16 in Silver Springs, topping the list.\nOver the first two months of the year, new construction of single-family homes in the Calgary census metropolitan area eased to 443 starts from 778 a year earlier, says Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. CMHC tracks new home construction in neighbourhood clusters. Between Jan. 1 and the end of February, three of these clusters recorded at least 50 single-family starts. A stretch of southeast Calgary, which includes New Brighton, Copperfield, Cranston, Auburn Bay and Mahogany carried the pace with 77 starts. A section of northeast Calgary, including Saddle Ridge, Saddlestone, Cityscape and Redstone was next with 64. Then Sherwood and Nolan Hill, in the city\u2019s northwest, followed with shovels in the ground for 51 single-family homes.\nOverall, single-family homes were more affordable in Calgary over the first two months of 2016 compared than the same time a year earlier.

Even while running a business as automated as Raw Athletics, if I'm not careful, I occasionally find myself engulfed in a never-ending to-do list.\nIf you've ever been in a situation like that \u2014 and I'm assuming most people here have \u2014 you know that you are usually left with two options: fire up the coffee pot and charge full-steam ahead into the god-awful hours of the night, or realize that the current situation is not sustainable and things must change in order to move forward.\nMany of us choose Door #1, which leads us down an unsustainable path that demands torturous amounts of mental energy. Up until a certain point, this hard work probably brings a strange sort of pleasure from the sense of accomplishment through the struggle, but the moment that grueling pace stop being fun and you begin to accomplish less and less, you're all of a sudden left with a severely depleted body and mind \u2014 you are sufficiently burned out.\nAt this point, the smartest thing you can do is hit the reset button, because no \"productivity hack\" will help you at this point. Yet clearly something needs to change. After all, Albert Einstein defined \"insanity\" as \"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\" \u2014 so if you're expecting to stay on the same unsustainable path yet expect to overcome your burnout AND accomplish everything you need to do, that's an insane plan. Literally.\nAccept the fact that you are burned out. The only true way to recover from a full-blown burnout is to rest your body and mind. Once you come to this realization, you won't feel guilty about taking more personal time because you will understand that the quicker you get back to normal, the quicker your business can move forward.\nGive yourself more down-time, but don't disconnect completely. Unless you're taking a mental detox vacation, I wouldn't recommend disconnecting completely. Realistically, completely disconnecting from your business without proper planning would probably lead to more stress instead of less, which is counterproductive for our purposes of beating the burnout. Take a look at your to-do list before you go to bed every night and plan on getting only a few things done the next day. Don't overreach on what you think you can accomplish \u2014 it's better to get a few things done early than to get more things done but still not reach your goals for that day. Set yourself up for success, not failure \u2014 it will do wonders for your mental recovery.\nGo to sleep earlier and/or wake up later. Usually people wake up early or go to sleep late to have more working hours in the day \u2014 which makes sense when you're functioning at full-strength \u2014 but when you're burned out, it doesn't matter if you're awake for longer because you're unproductive during those hours anyway. You're much better off getting those few extra hours of sleep. Working fewer hours will also give you a chance to see where your business processes could be improved in your absence. Do you need to hire more employees? Do you need to automate a specific process?\nOptimize your morning routine. Take this reboot time to really test out new lifestyle and routine changes that you would like to carry with you back to your normal everyday routine to try and prevent another burnout. One of the best things I personally have done for myself was to optimize my morning routine, which led to improved energy levels and focus throughout the entire day.\nTemporarily stop drinking coffee.

{"idx": "24336", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: By Blane Tetreault on Feb 8, 2019 at 5:04 p.m.\nIt is that time of year when we question why we live somewhere so cold, when we struggle to stop writing the previous year while writing the date, and when many of us already have given up on our New Year's resolutions. Whether you still have a resolution, let me issue a challenge: Be the change you wish to see in the world.\nThat phrase is often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. However, after researching, I found no conclusive evidence the influential activist from India spoke those exact words. Regardless of its origin, I believe adhering to this notion could positively impact us each individually and eventually our community as a whole. That is why I encourage you to consider how you can be the change this year.\nWe are a divided country. Diverging philosophies are constantly used to promote the virtues of one perspective or to condemn those of the opposition. Despite our perceived differences, I believe we all have the same basic desires: happiness, comfort, opportunity, and fulfillment, to name a few. We just have different visions for how we can realize those desires.\nWe often spend excessive amounts of emotional equity discussing issues largely beyond our personal control. It is our right to have concerns and reasonable opinions, but we cannot expect thoughts and words alone to bring change. Instead, let us live our proposed change this year in an effort to more significantly impact our world.\nWe each have an opportunity to influence people every day on a small scale with our actions and interactions. The great thing is, we do not have to be millionaires, famous, or have 10,000 followers on social media to be an influence. All we need is a reasonable change we would like to make and some discipline to hold ourselves accountable for personally making that change.\nOnce we lead by example, those around us will be more inclined to follow a similar path. Eventually, our personal change could be the catalyst that motivates our families, neighbors, coworkers, and possibly the entire community to change. That is definitely more worthwhile and effective than your standard Facebook posting.\nI have three primary changes I pledge to make in 2019: live a slower life, unplug from technology and media, and strive to buy local. Addressing these aspects of my life will better help me realize my basic desires and will lead to a more positive existence for my family and me. I believe these changes also could do the same for the citizens of our community.\nLiving a slower life means striving to value each day; life is a journey, not a destination. The moments in life that exist between significant goals and accomplishments often go unnoticed. However, they make up the bulk of our lives and where our lives can be most enriched. I plan to take time to enjoy a casual conversation, a cup of coffee, a sunset, and a simple walk instead of rushing from one commitment to the next.\nUnplugging from technology and media means striving to untether myself from my phone, computer, television, and internet obsessions. These things have become significant distractions that impact my conversations, relationships, health, and well-being. They truly are addictions that have become socially normalized and that negatively impact my life.\nFinally, striving to buy local means doing my best to support my community and enjoy quality over quantity by buying from locally owned or based businesses. Studies have proven that buying local keeps larger proportions of dollars spent within the community. This benefits all citizens. Even if it costs me slightly more, I will vote with my dollars by buying local.\nI encourage you to join me in this change challenge. What changes can"}

Marriott is often thought of as being more conservative with its designs, which largely appeal to the business-travel market. Boutique hotels are smaller, hip, upscale and built with an emphasis on location and taste.\n\"Things change, the collective unconscious changes,\" Schrager said in a phone interview. \"Fashion changes, automobiles change, styles change, our tastes in movies, music and theater change, and things are constantly evolving.\"\nThe companies say they hope to take the boutique hotel idea to a new level, focusing on \"a feeling rather than a look,\" Schrager said. Marriott said it hopes to sign five development deals under the still unnamed brand by the end of 2007, with 100 hotels open, or in the pipeline, within a decade. The company will open the hotels through new construction, conversions and renovations.\n\"The scale of this brand requires the reach, resources and expertise of a global player like Marriott, while the innovation necessary calls for the experience and originality of the category's most accomplished entrepreneur,\" chief executive J.W. \"Bill\" Marriott Jr. said in a statement.\nSchrager will focus on concept, design and food and beverage, while Marriott will make deals with developers and then manage the hotels. Schrager is credited with many innovative hotel trends, including making the hotel lobby a gathering place for customers and residents, and \"cheap chic,\" providing ambience and luxury at accessible prices.\nAn almost perfect contrast with Marriott, a Mormon who does not drink, Schrager came up in the free-wheeling, New York disco days of the 1970s and 1980s, founding Studio 54 and Palladium with his late partner, Steve Rubell.\nThe deal puts Marriott into a category with well-established brands from competitors such as Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant Group and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, whose line of W hotels have been wildly popular.\nMarriott plans to look into opening hotels in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and other major U.S. markets. New York was an obvious first target, and Marriott was visiting three to four sites there yesterday, he said in an interview.\nThe company is also looking at cities such as London, Berlin, Madrid, Shanghai and Beijing.\nAnalysts called the deal a logical, strategic move for the lodging behemoth, while not one that may have an immediate impact on its bottom line. The new brand appears to be part of a larger strategy of branching into new markets. Last month, Marriott announced it would create a line of family-themed resorts with Nickelodeon.\nBoutique hotels tend to be slightly more profitable because more alcohol and premium foods are sold, said Smedes Rose, a lodging analyst for Calyon Securities.\n\"I would say the margin is probably better [with a boutique hotel], and you're getting higher price points,\" Rose said.\nStaff writer Michael S.

Twenty-first century European travel runs the gamut from backpacking adventures to luxury tours. Whatever your style and comfort level, Europe is more accessible than ever before. The advent of the European Union facilitated intra-European travel by eliminating the need to keep track of local currency in the euro-zone countries. Likewise, the fact that most European automated teller machines accept American cards reduces dramatically the need to visit currency exchanges. If you are contemplating a trip to Europe, no time beats the present for making those critical travel decisions: who, what, when and where. Plan as if you were going to Europe this year; once you begin to collect information and narrow choices, it may prove impossible to turn back.\nMake a list of the people who will accompany you to Europe. Answer the \"who\" question first, since the age and number of your fellow travelers affects every other choice. Traveling with children mandates more parks and less museums, while organizing a family reunion requires one travel hub. Athletic couples might organize a European trip around an outdoor sport, such as hiking, biking or skiing. A group of singles might prefer lively urban centers. If you want to travel alone, you have only yourself to please.\nDecide up front the primary focus of your dream trip to Europe. Use absolute candor to avoid disappointment. Don't plan a backwoods adventure in Spain if you long to see the legendary European capitals (London, Paris and Rome appear on most \"great cities of Europe\" tours.) Take your traveling companions into account, but build the trip around your own vision of a European vacation.\nSelect your itinerary before selecting your dates, since sometimes where you go suggests appropriate timing. Your travel focus dictates whether one city or 10 make the itinerary. Research possible destinations using online Europe guides, such as Frommers or Lonely Planet, or printed travel guides. If nothing comes to mind, consider southwest France for vacations with children, the Italian lakes for romance, Greece for ancient history tours and Barcelona for a family reunion.\nDetermine the \"when\" of your trip by evaluating your vacation time and reviewing travel literature on your chosen destinations. Madrid is spectacular in May, but bakes you dry in the summer. Nothing is more romantic than a picnic in the Jardin du Luxenbourg in Paris, but not in January. Find a range of dates that work for your itinerary, then narrow it down from there. Realize that holidays and local festivals often require advance planning. Most Spanish destination cities, for example, fill up fast during Semana Santa, (the week between Christmas and New Years) while Edinburgh hotel rooms disappear during the Edinburgh Art Festival.\nReview your travel plans just before you head for bed in the evening. By morning, you may find your decision made.\nSpengler, Teo. \"How to Decide to Visit Europe.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/decide-visit-europe-43376.html.

Americans saw him as another trendy character to slap on children's lunch boxes.\nAn uncut version of \"Gojira,\" the Japan-made 1954 debut of Godzilla, gets released today for the first time on DVD. Consider it pop culture reparations for generations of embarrassment, starting in 1956, when \"Gojira\" was sliced and diced into \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" -- which added scenes with Burr and all but eliminated the important political messages in the film.\nGodzilla over the years suffered many horrible slights at the hands of Hollywood, but the disregard of Japanese culture by Americans can best be summed up in one word.\nThis annoying reptilian imbecile from \"The Godzilla Power Hour\" is perhaps our greatest argument that the 1970s was the suckiest decade ever. Godzooky could fly around using tiny wings, which was ridiculous to begin with because his body looked as if he dined on nothing but the Burger King dollar menu.\nGodzooky was the nephew of Godzilla. His deal with scientists on board the ship the Calico was almost identical to Moe Greene's agreement with Michael Corleone regarding Fredo in \"The Godfather\": The scientists tried to ignore the fact that Godzooky kept getting everyone into trouble, and in return Godzilla would bail the humans out every time the fat little idiot screwed up.\nMuch like Bigfoot, who battled \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" on television, Godzilla became a caricature in the 1970s and 1980s. Blue Oyster Cult followed the cowbell-laden 1976 hit \"(Don't Fear) the Reaper\" with a song called \"Godzilla.\" The character became green in American versions and developed ridiculous powers (laser vision and fire breath?) that had nothing to do with his radioactive origins. Even Burr returned, infecting the series again in \"Godzilla 1985.\"\nThe man in the suit is the genius of \"Gojira,\" and also the character's downfall. Watched in its proper context, the emotional impact of the movie is in the same league with that of the 1933 \"King Kong.\" The special effects were excellent for the time, with model work that still looks impressive. Best of all, unlike current blockbuster movies with special effects so seamless that they force the brain to take a two-hour vacation, \"Gojira\" forced kids to use their imaginations.\nTo be fair, Toho Studios, which created Godzilla, released its own substandard sequels -- making the character an even easier target for American smart-asses in the entertainment industry. The man in the suit, now a synonym for \"cheesy movie,\" became a much less effective tool as the Japan-made films were shot in color, the model-making got worse and the writing got more ridiculous.\nWhen satirists such"}

There are many reasons that nonreligious people should oppose this mandate: It will have adverse consequences on public health, distort health care markets, particularly for contraception, and threatens First Amendment rights.\nIt\u2019s tempting to see this discussion through the lens of the controversial debate about when life begins or the morality of reproductive choices, but that\u2019s really not the central issue.

That roughly matches sales for last year\u2019s iPhone 6s, which captured a 1% market share during its first weekend of availability, while the iPhone 6s plus, introduced at the same time, achieved a 0.3% share.\nHowever, the iPhone 6 captured a higher market share after its first weekend debut in 2014, suggesting that it was a bigger seller. It had a 2% market share while the iPhone 6 Plus, which was introduced at the same time, had a 0.3% share, according to Localytics.\nThis weekend\u2019s weaker results may be a bit misleading, however. Localytics says that iPhone 7 demand is significant and suggests that its sales would have been stronger had Apple make more supply available. Apple has said that demand was stronger than expected for iPhone 7 Plus, leading to supply shortages. The same holds true for its jet black iPhone 7 model.\n\u201cGiven that all iPhone 7 models and the jet-black version of the iPhone 7 Plus sold out in pre-orders, there is a demand for these models that was not seen in previous years,\u201d Localytics said in a statement.\nApple\u2019s iPhone 7 went on sale on Friday. While the interest led to some lines outside some Apple stores, many people had instead already preordered their phones.\nIn fact, the iPhone 7 Plus was fully sold out online before the smartphone became available in stores, leaving only iPhone 7 units on store shelves.\nApple\u2019s limited supply was apparent on Sept. 9, when the iPhone 7 went on preorder. Just hours after going on sale, supplies had run out and shipment dates were pushed back. Just three hours later, the jet black iPhone 7\u2019s shipment date was pushed back to November.\nAnalysts had raised questions about consumer interest in the iPhone 7 before it went on sale. While the phone comes with an updated design, an improved camera, and faster processors, its headphone jack has been removed, requiring owners to either use Bluetooth headphones or an adapter that comes in the box and allows them to employ wired headphones through the smartphone\u2019s Lightning port. Reports also say that Apple is planning a major upgrade to the iPhone next year, which could make some customers wait for 2017.\nIn addition to analyzing how well the iPhone 7 performed in its first week, Localytics detailed the current market share of all iPhones models. The iPhone 6 is still the most popular with a 31% market share among all iPhone owners followed by the iPhone 6s with 21% market share and the 5s at 15%. With its 1% share, the iPhone 7 is now tied with relatively ancient iPhone 4. The iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 0.2% market share makes it the lowest share of all models.\nOne other tidbit from the Localytics study: Apple\u2019s iOS 10, it latest mobile operating system, was running on 26% of all iOS devices after it became available six days ago.

He had hoped to pitch with the injury, but this week, he realized he couldn't do it.\nAfter consulting with the team's training staff, Erickson decided to forgo forego the season and have surgery. Dr. Lewis Yokum, who originally diagnosed Erickson's torn labrum in November, is expected to perform the procedure on Friday.\nErickson said he hopes to return by September, but several team officials confirmed a news release that said he'll miss the entire season.\n\"This,\" Erickson said, \"is the last thing I want.\"\nThe surgery likely means the end of Erickson's stint with the Orioles.

Club officials said insurance will cover less than half of that, so this is another financial blow for the Orioles, who still have the injured Albert Belle under contract for one more year.\nFrom a pitching standpoint, the club prepared itself for this possibility by re-signing Pat Hentgen and plucking Omar Daal and Rick Helling off the free-agent market. Even with Erickson out, the Orioles still have six established starters vying for five spots in the starting rotation: Rodrigo Lopez, Sidney Ponson, Daal, Hentgen, Helling and Jason Johnson.\n\"Not that this was something we expected,\" said Orioles executive vice president Jim Beattie, \"but HERE it was it was an eventuality we thought could happen, so we tried to prepare for it as much as possible.\"\nThe Orioles still intend to explore trades that would package a starter - most likely Ponson or Johnson - for a run-producing bat.

{"idx": "24355", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Salpointe basketball coach Brian Peabody is out of a job--despite a winning record.\nLast week, at the confluence of passion and pettiness, sustained excellence ran headlong into unrealistic expectations and Brian Peabody was fired as boys basketball coach at Salpointe Catholic High School.\nPeabody is arrogant, driven and obsessed. And, as the joke goes, those are his good points. While I have always liked him (a lot), he's one of the least-popular people I know, and believe me, I know some real stinkers. The average lawyer probably has more friends than Brian.\nBut he doesn't really care. His life is basketball, always has been. After only 13 years of coaching, Peabody is almost a third of the way toward 1,000 victories, a mark reached by only three other people in U.S. prep-coaching history.\nMy favorite coaching motto, and the message I try to impress on kids, is that the good is the enemy of the great. Being good is fine if that's the best you can do, but if you have a chance to be great and you settle for good, shame should follow you around like body odor follows Kid Rock. For decades, Salpointe boys' basketball had been good--sometimes very good--but it had never been great. Peabody made it great, but in doing so, he stepped on more toes than the remedial class at Arthur Murray's.\nHis first Salpointe team, liberally sprinkled with sophomores (he had kicked off several disruptive seniors), struggled to reach the regional playoffs. His next nine teams all went to state; two of them reached (but lost in) the championship game. Along the way, he ran up staggering win totals. His average record in his 10-year run at Salpointe was 24-6, and that includes the shaky first year. All the while, he used to say that coaches who win too much or lose too much draw negative attention, but those who manage to stay around the .500 mark in these politically correct times can keep their jobs forever.\nIt is the nature of sport that winning tends to generate superficial friends and substantial enemies. Peabody's single-mindedness added a double-digit exponent to the end of that truism. Let's just put it this way: Will Rogers never met Brian Peabody, and if Dale Carnegie had been a contemporary of Brian's, the book How To Win Friends and Influence People would have had an asterisk on it with the addition * Won't Work For Everybody. You could probably count the number of coaches who genuinely like Peabody on one hand and have enough fingers left over to pick the noses of all three Corr sisters.\nIn a way, he became a victim of his own success. His program got so well known, kids flocked to Salpointe to try to be a part of it. Every year, dozens of kids would get cut after tryouts, and that certainly fostered hurt feelings among the kids and hard feelings among the parents. His hyper coaching style and year-round regimen didn't go well with coaches from other schools that actually let kids live lives outside of the gymnasium.\nHe ran afoul of other coaches at Salpointe who resented the fact that the school was known almost exclusively for its boys' basketball team. And there were accusations that he illegally recruited athletes, although those claims have never been substantiated.\nOne Salpointe parent, who asked not to be identified, told me that the situation had"}

The group will meet with importers and government officials including a meeting with the New Zealand Timber Importers Association at the Pacific Islands Trade & Invest office in Newmarket.\nAs 60% of sawn timber is sold to markets in Australia and New Zealand, the visits aim to increase understanding among both exporters and importers of market requirements and opportunities for Solomon Islands sawn timber.\nAt present, the vast majority of Solomon Islands timber is exported to China as unprocessed round logs, with wide recognition of the unsustainable level of harvesting.

Markets in the EU and the United States have already introduced the requirement to demonstrate the legal origin of imported forestry products. Australia implemented similar legislation in November 2014, while New Zealand (which currently has a voluntary code of practice) could also follow suit.\nOther equally important discussions will include opportunities to improve timber quality and presentation, processing and end-product requirements, supply, consistency and potential markets for alternative species. Opportunities for potential collaboration with importers to improve timber processing quality in Solomon Islands will also be examined.

The step appeared to be a stop-gap measure to keep the state and economy functioning while a transitional administration is set up.\nProtesters have called for dramatic steps to ensure Egypt moves to a real democracy after nearly 30 years of autocratic rule under Mubarak and his ruling party.

Carnegie Mellon University scientists used a chapter of that book to learn a different lesson: identifying what different regions of the brain are doing when people read.\nResearchers from CMU's Machine Learning Department performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of eight people as they read a chapter of that Potter book. They then analyzed the scans, cubic millimeter by cubic millimeter, for every four-word segment of that chapter. The result was the first integrated computational model of reading, identifying which parts of the brain are responsible for such subprocesses as parsing sentences, determining the meaning of words and understanding relationships between characters.\n\"At first, we were skeptical of whether this would work at all,\" Mitchell said, noting that analyzing multiple subprocesses of the brain at the same time is unprecedented in cognitive neuroscience. \"But it turned out amazingly well and now we have these wonderful brain maps that describe where in the brain you're thinking about a wide variety of things.\"\n\"If I'm having trouble learning a new language, I may have a hard time figuring out exactly what I don't get,\" Mitchell said. \"When I can't understand a sentence, I can't articulate what it is I don't understand. But a brain scan might show that the region of my brain responsible for grammar isn't activating properly, or perhaps instead I'm not understanding the individual words.\"\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere have used fMRI scans to identify activation patterns associated with particular words or phrases or even emotions. But these have always been tightly controlled experiments, with only one variable analyzed at a time. The experiments were unnatural, usually involving only single words or phrases, but the slow pace of fMRI -- one scan every two seconds -- made other approaches seem unfeasible.\n\"No one falls asleep in the scanner during Leila's experiments,\" Mitchell said.\nThey devised a technique in which people see one word of a passage every half second -- or four words for every two-second fMRI scan. For each word, they identified 195 detailed features -- everything from the number of letters in the word to its part of speech. They then used a machine learning algorithm to analyze the activation of each cubic centimeter of the brain for each four-word segment.\n\"The test subjects read Chapter 9 of Sorcerer's Stone, which is about Harry's first flying lesson,\" she noted. \"It turns out that movement of the characters -- such as when they are flying their brooms - is associated with activation in the same brain region that we use to perceive other people's motion. Similarly, the characters in the story are associated with activation in the same brain region we use to process other people's intentions.\"\n\"It's sort of like a DNA fingerprint -- you may not understand all aspects of DNA's function, but it guides you in understanding cell function or development,\" Mitchell said. \"This model of reading initially is that kind of a fingerprint.\"\nA complementary study by Wehbe and Mitchell, presented earlier this fall at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record brain activity in subjects reading Harry Potter. MEG can record activity every millisecond, rather than every two seconds as in fMRI scanning, but can't localize activity with the precision of fMRI. Those findings suggest how words are integrated into memory -- how the brain"}

It\u2019s a familiar moniker among those who live here, and a reputation that spreads as more and more people come and go from our neighborly metropolis. Many of those going are the young, newly minted degree in hand. Seeing jobs and new thrills they are drawn to cities that, well, aren\u2019t Buffalo. But what\u2019s it like for those who come back, whether to stay or just to visit? Seeing old friends and good neighbors, familiar neighborhoods and favored stomping grounds? And how far does a good neighbor go to help out a Buffalonian in need? Caitlin McAneny raises these questions in her funny and poignant play \u201cGood Neighbors\u201d, part of Road Less Traveled\u2019s season opener, Buffalo Rises.\nThe East Side. Lovejoy. Kaisertown. Elmwood Village. The West Side. Riverside. Black Rock. Parkside. North Buffalo. The Old First Ward. South Buffalo. Like any old city, Buffalo is a chain of communities, each with a distinct personality and history of its own. South Buffalo, where McAneny sets \u201cGood Neighbors\u201d still largely retains the Irish roots planted by immigrants long ago. With their large, traditional St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, Irish step dancing schools and Gaelic street signs, their definitive legacy outlasts the city\u2019s changing profile. It was once a thriving community fueled by the immigrants flocking to work in steel plants, factories and rail yards. Like the rest of city, South Buffalo was emptied by economic downturns and subsequent population flight. From its highest point of 573,000, Buffalo lost 55% of its population by the end of the twentieth century, earning a not-so-coveted spot on the list of 20 most quickly deteriorating regions in the nation.

A sense of camaraderie pervades, a unity of those who stand together against mercurial Mother Nature and repeated economic and athletic disappointments. You lend a hand; you watch the streets, and welcome home all those want to return with open arms. The unity and identity of a Buffalonian resists changing time and location.

That would mean finding money at the outset to cover the entire $560 million cost, rather than the $320 million estimated for the first phase.\nA committee of business, government and civic leaders is proposing construction of the system to speed commuters, shoppers and tourists through a downtown area that has grown dramatically beyond the boundaries of the Loop.\nThe committee, funded by RTA grants and working under the auspices of the Metropolitan Planning Council, has produced a proposal to cover the cost of the system equally from three sources: a federal program for new transit lines, revenue from property owners in a special taxing district served by the system and an increase in the state gas tax.\nBut Franzen said funds generated by a proposed program that includes a 6- cent-a-gallon increase in the state`s fuel tax should go only for highway improvements and repairs and repairs to the existing transit infrastructure.\nThe increased gas levy was proposed last week by Illinois Transportation Secretary Gregory Baise. Under his plan, $3.7 billion would be generated over the next five years for highway upgrading, and the RTA would receive about $1.2 billion to replace aging buses and rail cars and to shore up and replace crumbling elevated structures, track and maintenance facilities.\nFranzen called on property owners served by the system to produce enough cash to match federal funds.\n''Without private money in the downtown area making a strong, strong financial commitment, the circulator system cannot fly,'' he said.\nState transportation officials believe the trolley supporters are too optimistic about their ability to get dwindling federal dollars for the project. If this assessment is correct, another source of funding must be found or the private sector would have to cover even more of the system`s cost.\nAs proposed, the first phase of the system would be built from about Canal Street east on Monroe Street to Columbus Drive, north on Columbus and Fairbanks Court to Chicago Avenue and then east to State Street.\nA second leg would run roughly along Canal Street north from about Monroe, past Union and Chicago & North Western Stations and across the Chicago River. It then would run east along the river bank, across Fairbanks Court to about Lake Shore Drive.\nThe second phase would extend the system south to the lakefront museums and McCormick Place, west to sports stadiums and the West Side complex of medical facilities and north and south through the Loop, connecting the River North area and the South Loop."}

And there is a perception among some marketers that this target audience is particularly enigmatic and hard to connect with.\nWith little understanding, the default marketing approach is often to just \u2018do something online\u2019 or \u2018create a social media campaign\u2019. Unfortunately it takes more than the inclusion of a hashtag, video, Facebook page or consumer-with-brand-selfie request to drive engagement with young people today.\nIn 2007, Jigsaw conducted a qualitative study into young Australians aged 18-24.\nAt the time, the issue of local youth identity was particularly hot, following the aftermath of the Cronulla race riots and the cultural cringe from Lara Bingle\u2019s \u2018Where the bloody hell are you\u2019 campaign. The objectives of the study were to expose what young people were really thinking and explore the defining traits of this generation.\nSeven years later, we have refocused on this audience; with the challenge of getting beneath current media rhetoric and stereotypes. Having previously conducted a similar study helped us pull apart \u2018coming of age\u2019 characteristics vs. traits which are a by-product of 2014\u2019s unique technological, political, cultural and environmental landscape. This time we could also employ fresher methodologies (e.g. online communities, tasks involving Spotify, Tinder etc).\nSo what\u2019s changed? Here are a few of the shifts we discovered.\nBack then, we found that success for young people was defined by their own goals. The older stereotypes of success (e.g. high paying job, big house, flash car) no longer applied and instead success largely equated to personal happiness i.e. doing what you want and then making a living from this.\nFast forward and 18-24-year-olds are still rejecting their parents\u2019 definitions of success. However what\u2019s changed is that there is phenomenal pressure to not just do what you want, but to do it in a BIG way.\nThere are so many high profile young entrepreneurs, bloggers and vloggers who have changed lives, made millions/billions or simply become celebrities. So young people currently find it hard to justify doing things in an \u2018average way\u2019. They therefore appreciate anyone who can support them as they strive towards achieving their large-scale dreams.\nYoung people told us that they were being buffeted by an accelerated culture in which everything seemed fast paced e.g. trends coming and going, new technologies, news stories constantly breaking.

The ideas could then be deployed to other maturing fields such as in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia.\nArdent says it needs at least two companies to sign up for a project to get off the ground. Well-Safe, another company offering a new approach, also needs several operators to commit.\nSo far, Ardent has found it challenging to persuade companies to be the first to sign up.\n\u201cEveryone is queuing to be second,\u201d said Ardent\u2019s Decommissioning Director Stuart Martin.\nOil companies are keen to reduce costs in a part of the market dominated by major global players such as TechnipFMC , Schlumberger, Saipem and AllSeas.\nBeyond the floating tanks, Ardent has also joined forces with oil services firm WorleyParsons and technology and shipping group Lloyd\u2019s Register, to bring a one-stop-shop service.\nThis could save money by cutting out the need for lots of different contractors. Well-Safe proposes coordinating decommissioning work across companies to share equipment and staff.\n\u201cYou got to give Well-Safe and the others a real tip of the hat. We all want them to win. It\u2019s in the best interest of the industry,\u201d said Jim House, CEO of Neptune Energy, which is planning decommissioning for its Juliet and Minke fields in the North Sea.\nOil platforms are usually removed piece by piece and taken to the shore using complex vessels. The floating tanks that Ardent used to lift the Costa Concordia, are much cheaper to use, industry experts say.\n\u201cThis technology could have significant potential cost efficiencies,\u201d the Oil and Gas Technology Center, which is funded by the British government, said in a report.\nBut Ardent says it would need contracts for at least two buoyant tanks to go below current costs per ton of steel removed and three to get below its target cost reduction of around a third. Britain\u2019s industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority, has set a target of 35 percent cost cuts compared with 2015 levels.\nWell-Safe\u2019s main lever for cost reduction also depends on several operators committing to contracts.\nArdent is also proposing to oversee a project from production to scrapping the metal onshore. Worley Parsons would operate the platform and maintain the equipment and Lloyd\u2019s Register would plug the wells.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot about an emerging set of companies and we don\u2019t yet know which is going to be the winning model,\u201d said Boston Consulting Group\u2019s Philip Whittaker.\nWith other fields maturing and drying up across the world and some experts expecting demand for oil to peak in the 2030s, the North Sea is a test bed for new decommissioning projects.\nIf a company can plug oil wells without leaks and remove thousands of tons of steel platforms and pipelines, some 50 years old, in the rough, deep seas between Scotland, England and Norway, they should be able to do it anywhere.\nIndustry body Oil and Gas UK, expects"}

It had been more than 20 years since a congressional Democrat incumbent lost a primary in the city.\nClarke, who was first elected to Congress in 2006, eked out a meager 1,075-vote win against the 30-year-old Bunkeddeko to hold on to her seat.\n\u201cThe blood is in the water,\u201d one ex-staffer said.\nInterviews with two former Clarke staffers paint a picture of a lawmaker who is perpetually late, remains largely disengaged and has accomplished little since her first election.\n\u201cTo say that she was chronically tardy I believe was factually accurate,\u201d one said.\nShe is expected to win reelection against Republican Lutchi Gayot in her heavily Democratic district in Central Brooklyn this November, but her political future is an open question.\nAn analysis of data by the CUNY Graduate Center Mapping Service shows the demographic changes in the city.

{"idx": "24396", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: That was almost too easy. After music and technology lobbyists hammered out a series of complicated compromises, Representatives combined several bills into the Music Modernization Act, which passed the House unanimously last month. Now that the legislation has been introduced in the Senate, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has introduced an alternative bill that could slow it down.\nWednesday (May 23), Sen. Wyden introduced the Accessibility for Curators, Creators, Educators, Scholars, and Society (ACCESS) to Recordings Act, which would essentially federalize recordings made before 1972, which are currently covered under state law. This would allow rights holders and performers to collect royalties when their works are streamed online, which they currently can\u2019t do. But the bill wouldn\u2019t be as good for creators and rights holders as the current version of the Music Modernization Act, which would grant them this right without otherwise changing the way they\u2019re covered under state law. How much support the bill will gather isn\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s possible that it could slow down -- or alter -- the broader legislation.\nWhile the relevant provision of the Music Modernization Act would let rights holders of pre-1972 recordings collect money until 2067, Wyden\u2019s bill would have these acts enter the public domain sooner: either 95 years after they were released or 120 years after they were recorded, whichever comes first. That means that some recordings would begin entering the public domain before 2067. The most valuable pre-1972 recordings, made in the 1960s and very early 1970s, would begin doing so in 2055.\nWyden\u2019s bill also calls for all pre-1972 recordings to lose all of the protection they currently have under state law. Under current law -- and the Music Modernization Act wouldn\u2019t change this -- all state law protection expires no later than 2067, although in some jurisdictions it could run out sooner. It also says that works recorded between 1923 and 1930 will enter the public domain if they\u2019re not used, and it offers a three-year window from liability for statutory damages in some cases.\n\u201cCopyright reform for pre-1972 sound recordings must consider the interests of all stakeholders -- not just those of the for-profit record labels,\u201d Sen. Wyden said in a statement. This has become a talking point of anti-copyright activists, who have characterized the Music Modernization Act as a copyright term extension -- inaccurately. Also, any reform of pre-1972 recordings would help not only labels but performers, who are paid directly by SoudExchange when the works are transmitted digitally on interactive services like Pandora and SiriusXM.\nIt has been suggested that any reduction in state law copyright protection would constitute a \u201ctaking,\u201d and thus be unconstitutional. But this bill seems intended as a way to negotiate changes in the Music Modernization Act, so it\u2019s unlikely that will ever be tested."}

Otherwise, the mice were left to themselves, continuing to eat and groom as they normally would.

However, the findings show that muscles also send their own signals to the brain, with consequences for neural health.\nWhen the researchers investigated the connection more closely, they found out that lack of physical activity lowers the amount of oxygen in the body, leading to an anaerobic environment and altered metabolism. Furthermore, reduced exercise impacts two genes. One of these, CDK5Rap1, is known to be critical to the health of mitochondria \u2013\u2013 rod-shaped organelles that can be considered the power generators of the cell, converting oxygen and nutrients into adenosine triphosphate.\nThis feedback loop helps explain several health problems, ranging from cardiovascular disease as a result of sedentary lifestyles to more devastating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and motor neuron disease.\nBeyond medicine practice here on Earth, the findings could prove very important when planning future missions in space. The research shows that physical activity is critical in order to grow new neural cells and, as such, astronauts on long-term missions ought to perform load-bearing exercise daily. In the future, the researchers plan on studying the altered genes identified here in more depth.\n\u201cThe take-home message for the general public is that the physical inactivity is detrimental to our mental health,\u201d co-author Dr. Daniele Bottai, also from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, told ZME Science.\n\u201cOne could say our health is grounded on Earth in ways we are just beginning to understand,\u201d concludes Bottai.\nThe findings appeared in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience."}

Is it time to cut the mumble, asks Ben Milne.\n\"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man,\" Lord Hall tells the Radio Times, \"but I think muttering is something we could look at.\"\nHis comments are likely to strike a clear chord with viewers. Recent dramas like Birdsong and Parade's End apparently drew complaints because of indistinct dialogue. It's a perennial gripe that the senior generation has always had about young people - that they don't speak clearly enough.\nAndrew Billen, TV critic for the Times, gets more mail about not being able to hear dialogue than on any other subject. \"TV is made by young people, but it's watched by old people,\" he notes.\nBillen says that as people get older they find it more difficult to distinguish dialogue from background noise. TV makers don't take this into consideration, he suggests. And production techniques have made things worse.\n\"It's quite fun to lay on a great piece of music behind a drama but on most people's tinny screens the sounds can become indistinct.\"\nTrends in acting haven't necessarily helped. Method acting tries to capture the \"truth\" of a character - even if that character can't be heard properly - rather than bowing to stodgy old considerations about being audible from the cheap seats.\nIts foremost proponent was Marlon Brando - a man given the nickname \"Mumbles\" by his Guys and Dolls co-star Frank Sinatra. This was an actor who put cotton wool in his mouth, while playing Don Corleone in The Godfather, to make himself less intelligible.\nOther actors who have been accused of mumbling include Kristen Stewart in the Twilight films, not to mention Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain and Jeff Bridges in True Grit - both of whom perfect an indistinct cowboy diction known to anyone who's seen Blazing Saddles as Authentic Frontier Gibberish.\nBut is it fair to blame the actors?

He says that most performers are just doing what's been asked of them by the producers and directors.\n\"Everything that is going on is to do with the sound department of the production, and their choices in an edit suite.\"\nBut perhaps the last word should belong to Sheb Wooley, who worked with a young Clint Eastwood. \"He didn't speak his words very loud.

{"idx": "24407", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Being able to read and write is the most basic foundation of knowledge accumulation and further skill development. Without literacy, there can be no quality education. Presently, 1 in 5 adults is illiterate, two-thirds of whom are women. At the current pace, over 700 million adults worldwide will still not be able to read in 2015.  In global education discussions, literacy rates are most often reported for adolescents and adults, an ex post facto measure of the failure of primary school systems to impart basic skills in the most formative schooling years. It is clear that much needs to be done to provide these adolescents and adults with access to successful literacy programs. But we must also ensure that children with access to schooling are not growing up to be illiterate.\nChildren enrolled and regularly attending school for the first three grades should be able to read basic text. Evidence shows that acquiring this ability to read sets students up for further learning, enabling them to read and comprehend progressively more advanced materials and acquire additional knowledge.\nAs explained in our earlier policy brief, data from numerous countries show that children in school are failing to acquire the most basic of skills, measured as the ability to read words of connected text. We called for a global paradigm shift that places learning at the center of the global education discourse. This shift requires the major bilateral and multilateral actors to refocus their own efforts on supporting learning in the classroom and measuring progress by increased learning outcomes. There has been some progress here, such as USAID\u2019s goal to improve reading skills for primary school children in its new education strategy and the World Bank\u2019s Education Strategy 2020, Learning for All: investing in people\u2019s knowledge and skills to promote development.\nThis shift of focus also requires substantial changes on the ground, including encouraging and supporting a culture of literacy and learning at the community level. For example, Gove and Cvelich highlight some main factors contributing to low reading levels, including a lack of support for teachers, limited instructional time, poorly resourced schools, the absence of books in the home and policies regarding the language of instruction.  In Mali, a recent survey found that three-quarters of grade 2 students did not have a textbook and no student had supplementary reading books at school.  In The Gambia, the vast majority of students who demonstrated a level of reading fluency said that they had books at home. Globally, in both developed and developing economies, a relatively consistent proxy for \u201cparental commitment to education\u201d is the number of books in the home. A 20-year study of 27 countries found that children growing up in homes with many books get three years more schooling than their peers who come from homes without books.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution to improving the quality of education in developing countries. However, there is plenty of room for innovation to address some of the biggest barriers to improving reading levels, including availability of appropriate reading materials at school and at home. In disadvantaged communities, where there are relatively few books and even fewer books in local languages and that deal with culturally-relevant topics, innovation is needed to help develop a robust culture of literacy.\nAdditional support for emergent readers. E-readers provide additional support to teachers in teaching children how to read, an important supplement in primary school classrooms in low-income countries where there may be 40 or 50 students per teacher. In such cases, students are required to work independently or in small groups while the teacher is working with other students. The text-to-speech feature on e-readers can read books aloud to the student,"}
{"idx": "24408", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: How to Relieve Arthritis Pain. Joint pain is one of the hallmarks of arthritis. The swelling, stiffness and inflammation that accompany this, sometimes debilitating, disease are the main causes of arthritis pain. Fortunately, there are now many ways to relieve arthritis pain.\nTake some aspirin. Aspirin is the tried and true standby of arthritis pain relief. It has been used for this purpose for decades and remains one of the most effective ways to relieve the pain of arthritis. In fact, many arthritis patients start out with aspirin when they first get the disease.\nTry an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory. Inflammation is the primary culprit in arthritis pain. Readily available anti-inflammatories, such as Motrin and Aleve, may provide pain relief for mild to moderate arthritis.\nGet a prescription. If over-the-counter medications don't work for you, you probably need something stronger. Your rheumatologist or family doctor can prescribe a variety of drugs, such as Bextra and Voltaren, that are aimed at relieving arthritis pain.\nRub in a topical ointment. You can get plenty of good pain-relieving creams over the counter. Look for ointments containing capsaicin (derived from cayenne pepper) for the best results.\nStart exercising. Even though it may cause you more pain in the short term, exercise is remarkably effective at relieving arthritis pain over the long term. This is because exercise increases blood flow to the joints and strengthens the surrounding muscles.\nUse ice packs on painful, tender joints. Ice can help to reduce inflammation (taking pain away with it) and can also temporarily numb the area. You can use ice packs as often as you see fit.\nSoak in warm water. A hot tub or warm bath can relax your muscles and increase blood flow throughout your body, resulting in a lessening of pain.\nIf you are on prescription arthritis medicine, always check with your doctor before using any over-the-counter pain relievers. You must do this to make sure the over-the-counter drug is right for you and will not negatively interact with your prescription medication. Exercise is a must for arthritis patients. If you do not move your joints, there is an increased risk that they will become frozen in place or otherwise deformed. Therefore, you must exercise--even on days when you don't feel like it. If you decide to soak in a tub of water, make sure the water is not too hot. If your skin turns red on contact with the water, you should add some cold water to the tub before getting in."}

NFL Media's Albert Breer confirmed the receiver's absence was the cause of the suspension, per a source briefed on the situation.\nGordon was suspended for 10 games earlier this year for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.\nAs Breer notes, Gordon missing his 11th game will keep the wideout from accruing a season toward free agency -- players must play in six games to earn a year of eligibility toward becoming a free agent.\nWhether or not the Browns pay Josh Gordon for Sunday's game will determine whether he accrues the year. Gordon can appeal with the NFLPA.\nUpon his return, Gordon didn't look close to the player that led the league in receiving in 2013.

The previous administration considered trading the troubled receiver prior to the 2013 season. Now, after a lost season, there is a chance the new one might consider moving on from the gifted but misguided wideout.\nAs for Johnny Football, NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Manziel was fined for being late to medical treatment, per a Browns source.

Former Nissan representative director and Ghosn's close aide Greg Kelly was also indicted, it said.\nAn indictment takes the prosecutors\u2019 pursuit of Ghosn to the next level, while representing a victory for Nissan chief executive officer Hiroto Saikawa who has emerged as a driving force into the investigation into Ghosn\u2019s alleged wrongdoing.\nGhosn is in custody in Japan after his Nov 19 arrest on allegations of under-reporting his income at Nissan, which has since ousted him as chairman.\nWhile he remains at the helm of Renault, Nissan\u2019s partner in the world\u2019s biggest auto alliance, he has been replaced on an interim basis. Tension within the Franco-Japanese partnership that has been held together by Ghosn for two decades has all but exploded into the open since his shock incarceration.\nHere\u2019s how Ghosn\u2019s legal process could play out: After indictment, Ghosn is likely to remain in custody as prosecutors continue to investigate additional suspected crimes.\nA trial typically takes place about 40 to 50 days after indictment.

{"idx": "24427", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Education has never been exclusively about academics\u2014because preparing for college, career, and citizenship isn't only about reading and math achievement. Without compromising any of the rigor reflected in college-and-career-ready standards, we need to act on the knowledge that schools have an essential role in preparing young people to take their place in the community. Properly understood, strong academic standards create an ideal context for realizing this holistic vision, but supporting students in developing character, life skills, and agency can no longer be relegated only to a supporting role in reaching test-score goals.\nWith a rich vision of student success in mind, it is clear that the answer is not a program or intervention. Social-emotional and academic development has to be infused into every aspect of the school and student experience. The National Commission coalesced around the sturdy vision of a three-legged stool: Students need (1) explicit instruction in understanding and applying social-emotional skills/competencies; (2) opportunities to practice these skills/competencies embedded into academic instruction; and (3) a learning environment that models safety, respect, and purpose so that students can invest their whole selves in learning.\nResources: Straight-up resource inequity persists, representing a moral failure of our society. Resources should be allocated relative to need, including additional counseling, mental-health support, and wrap-around services for the many children who experience trauma through exposure to violence, neglect and abuse, and food and housing insecurity. The National Commission highlights ways that school systems can more effectively partner with out-of-school-time youth development organizations to foster more seamless connections in support of learning and development.\nIdentity: Creating learning environments and experiences that enable students to develop into their best selves requires affirming students' heritage and cultural background as assets to build on. Issues like stereotype threat and implicit bias are flip sides of the same coin and need to be addressed proactively; both teachers and students need to learn that effort and mindset are more determinative of achievement gains than race or socioeconomic status.\nAgency: Finally, equity in social-emotional learning requires giving voice to the aspirations and concerns of families, community members, and students themselves\u2015and sharing power with these perspectives. Value judgments inevitably inform thousands of decisions about what to prioritize (and what to stop), how to combine building blocks of student success into a vision and a curriculum, all the way down to what books to read and what cultural institutions to visit on field trips. Parents and students must be actors, not objects, in defining a richer vision of student success and grappling with its implications.\nAs should be clear from the equity discussion, policy has to invest in setting enabling conditions, but should tread carefully so as not to displace community prerogatives. There simply is no one-size-fits-all approach to advancing an agenda that supports the comprehensive development of every young person. Moreover, the most important work happens in schools and classrooms in the context of the communities and families they serve; this work needs to be both responsive to local context and iterative to reflect what is learned over time. Policymakers can bring focus through the bully pulpit and accelerate progress with resources, but ultimately this is a practice-change agenda that needs to be owned by educators along with the students and communities they serve.\nThe National Commission will release its final recommendations in January 2019, giving voice to a growing consensus that learning is a social-emotional and academic enterprise. Schools need to pay attention to each of these dimensions of learning and development for students to thrive in college, careers, and in their communities.\nAt the National Commission's inaug"}

The official says, however, that regardless of what the President says or does during his European trip, he can expect to face sizable protest demonstrations against his defense policies.\nPressure is building in the US Congress, as well as within the bureaucracy, for early talks with the Soviets on nuclear weapons.\nSenator Jackson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, disagreed with President Reagan's assertion made during a press conference on March 31 that the Soviets held a ''margin of superiority'' over the US in nuclear weaponry. The senator said that despite some imbalances, a ''qualitative advantage'' held by the US in bombers and submarines had to be taken into account.\nA number of experts within the government itself are startled by President Reagan's news conference statement on the nuclear balance. Although they are inhibited from saying so publicly, they tend to agree with Jackson that the President's assertion went too far. They consider it potentially damaging to the European allies' confidence in the United States to speak of Soviet superiority.\nOne official asserts that the Soviets are incapable of tracking US submarines and that this would become even more difficult for the Soviets once the new Trident submarines are deployed. American submarines are said to be much quieter than their Soviet counterparts. The official says that US B-52 bombers are still far superior to anything possessed by the Soviets. And, the official says, once the US deploys its new D-5 missile warhead, it could prove to be extremely threatening to the Soviets' land-based missiles.\nThe administration is currently narrowing down its negotiating options. But the official says that its final strategic arms negotiating position is likely to include not only limits on nuclear missile launchers, as did the SALT II treaty, but also limits on the size and numbers of warheads.\nOn the Soviet side, meanwhile, a problem could emerge from the leadership struggle reported to be under way. With President Leonid Brezhnev ailing and possibly on his way out of power, the Soviet leadership may temporarily lack the unity needed to go to the negotiating table.\nGlobal News Blog Why did North Korea test fire a submarine missile?"}

The tactic worked and \u2018Mushy\u2019 read aloud a poem, before later standing in front of his entire year to deliver a speech, with the help of his iPod. The emotional scenes were one of the stand out moments of the television show.\nThe pair, both motivational speakers, are still in contact and can sometimes be seen delivering talks together.\n\u201cA lot of the stuff he [Mushy] talks about that he battles through, I think people see it sort of as a symbol for their own.\n\u201cEverybody has had trouble at school. I went through bullying and all sorts, everybody struggles through something.\n\u201cAnd whether it is a stammer, or not a stammer, a mental health issue, whatever it may be, I think what his journey represents is overcoming that and just being resilient enough to say \u2018no, I\u2019m not going to let that define me for the rest of my life. I\u2019m going to blast through it and become the best I can be\u2019.\nResilience is one of the values Mr Burton, from Wakefield, hopes to instil in the students at his school, where he has also brought in two simple new rules - be nice and work hard.\n\u201cThe vision is to give every child the skills, opportunities, the means and the values to go ahead and make a positive impact in society and have the best life they possibly can have,\u201d he says.\nHe wants to see the school, currently rated as \u2018requires improvement\u2019 by education watchdog Ofsted, become outstanding, whilst engaging and working with the community and developing extra-curricular activities are among his other priorities.\n\u201cI really want this school to be outward facing, truly a community academy and I want it to be the first choice for parents in this area to send their children to. I can\u2019t wait to talk to people about that,\u201d he says, referencing the school\u2019s forthcoming open evening on October 4.\nThe start of the new term - Mr Burton\u2019s first as head - last month, marked the beginning of his 13th year at Thornhill.\nHe joined the school as a newly-qualified teacher in September 2006, after completing his Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at the University of Leeds, progressing to become head of the English department, assistant headteacher under Jonny Mitchell - the head at the time of Educating Yorkshire, and then deputy, with a pastoral role, before becoming headmaster.\nHis own children, Olivia, four, and Theo, two, are never far from his thoughts either. \u201cIf it\u2019s not good enough for my kids, it\u2019s not good enough for anybody else\u2019s kids,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMy little girl has just started primary school and, as a parent, you don\u2019t realise until they step through"}

State religious department officials arrested the women, along with one transgender child, at a wedding party in a private home on the night of June 8 and 9 under the state\u2019s Sharia law, which criminalizes \u201ca male person posing as a woman.\u201d All pleaded guilty, except the child, who was released.\nThe religious department officials had infiltrated the wedding party and arrested the transwomen, several of whom were wedding planners, known locally as \u201cmak andam,\u201d while others were invited guests at the wedding. The officials beat one of the women \u2013 choking her and kicking her \u2013 and tore another woman\u2019s clothing in the course of the arrest, according to Justice for Sisters, a Malaysian transgender rights group. After they were sentenced on June 9, because they are legally considered \u201cmen,\u201d they were transferred to the male ward of Sungai Udong prison. There, prison authorities forcibly shaved their heads in what the women said was an effort to negate their gender identity.\nOn June 11, a defense lawyer filed a request to have the women\u2019s sentences re-evaluated and to secure their release on bail. According to Justice for Sisters activists at the hearing, the judge\u2019s actions appeared to reflect considerable personal bias in the case. The judge asked the accused, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if [you] are in prison?\u201d He told them that their shaved heads made them \u201chandsome.\u201d He set bail conditions that were impossible for many of the women to meet, including that their parents \u2013 some of whom lived in distant states or were ill \u2013 physically come to court within 30 minutes to bail them out. The women served five days of their sentence before prison officials released them early on June 13 since their release date fell on a weekend.\nMuslims in Malaysia are subject to both federal criminal law and to state-level Sharia criminal enactments, which vary from state to state. All 13 states and the federal territories criminalize transgender women, and at least three states criminalize transgender men, solely on the basis of how they dress. Section 66 of the Negeri Sembilan Syariah Criminal Enactment states, \u201cAny male person who, in any public place wears a woman\u2019s attire and poses as a woman shall be guilty of an offence.\u201d The law imposes a sentence of up to 1000 ringgit (about US$300) and six months in prison.\nMalaysia\u2019s National Registration Department refuses to allow transgender people to change the gender markers on their identity cards in order to match the gender they identify with, leading to unending cycles of arrest.\nThe constitutionality of the law has been challenged in a case currently before the Putrajaya Court of Appeal. The petitioners \u2013 three transgender women who have been arrested under the Negeri Sembilan law in previous incidents \u2013 argue that the law violates rights protected by Malaysia\u2019s constitution, which is superior to state Sharia law.

They called this particular plane NASA 905.\nThe museum is throwing a huge party for this 747, including astronauts, skydivers and fireworks -- all centered around Independence Plaza, where a replica space shuttle called Independence sits on top of the airplane.\nVisitors will be able to go inside both the 747 and the Independence to explore exhibits and artifacts from the space shuttle era.\nMuseum exhibits manager Paul Spana worked with a Boeing historian who provided photos detailing 747 interiors to help maintain accuracy.\n\"Aviation enthusiasts will be excited at the opportunity to see a 747 closer than they would at any airport,\" Spana said.\nBut the flight deck will be off limits to visitors, at least during the first year, when crowds would have a hard time maneuvering the spiral staircase to the cockpit.\nA few of the pilots and flight engineers from this airplane also are expected to be on hand for Saturday's ceremony.\nFrom the early 1980s to the end of the shuttle program in 2011, the 747s were called upon to ferry shuttles that landed in California back to launch facilities in Florida, flying low and slow, at 13,000-15,000 feet high and about 285 mph.\nNASA 905 flew internationally, too, carrying the shuttle Enterprise to England and the Paris Air Show in 1983.\nSo, how did the 905 lift all that weight? For one thing, NASA stripped the plane's main cabins clean.\nIt was pretty much the cockpit and a big empty shell. That was it. No seats, galleys, lavatories, bars. No passengers, luggage, food, water, cargo. Built for maximum power, maximum lift.\nNASA changed the original 747 design by adding vertical stabilizers to the plane's tail to improve directional stability.\nIt also did a lot of testing on how to attach the spacecraft to the airplane to achieve the best aerodynamics.\nNASA's choice of the 747 to ferry the shuttle is just one more example of the importance of the aircraft.\nNicknamed the Jumbo Jet when it entered commercial service in 1970 with Pan Am, it was the world's first wide-body airliner, offering unprecedented seating capacity and long range.

Little did they realise that disaster awaited them.\nThat was 1974, when Zaire powered exuberantly to victory over Zambia in the Nations Cup final held in Egypt. Three months later they left West Germany with their tails between their legs having scored no goals and conceded 14 in a disastrous World Cup campaign that fixed the image of African football\u2019s \u201cnaivety\u201d in the popular mind.\nThere will be no repeat in Germany this summer, not least because the newly crowned African champions, Egypt, will be absent, along with such established heavyweights as Nigeria, Cameroon and Senegal. But the showing of Africa\u2019s five World Cup representatives \u2013 four of whom will be debutants \u2013 at the 25th staging of the continental championship has raised concerns that their showing in the 2006 World Cup could be the continent\u2019s worst in years.\nMuch good football was played by well organised teams in Egypt. Unfortunately, for the most part those playing it would not be going to Germany, including less-fancied sides such as Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two of the World Cup qualifiers, Angola and Togo, were drawn together but neither made it out of Group B. Ghana, missing the injured Michael Essien of Chelsea, were more impressive and, having beaten Senegal, needed only to beat pointless Zimbabwe to qualify for the last eight, but surprisingly crashed to a 2-1 defeat. A fourth qualifier, Tunisia, lasted only one game more. But although the reigning champions were edged out on penalties in the quarter-finals by Nigeria they had good organisation, a dangerous striker in the Brazilian-born Francileudo dos Santos and less of the play-acting and gamesmanship that had marked their victory as hosts two years earlier.\nThe World Cup qualifiers who really bucked the trend were Ivory Coast. Their quarter-final with Cameroon turned out to be a classic for connoisseurs of the muscular school of African defending, with the Elephants\u2019 back line taking turns to boot the tournament\u2019s top scorer, Samuel Eto\u2019o. Cameroon had been possibly the most impressive team in the group phase but Ivory Coast, under the experienced French coach Henri Michel, successfully broke their rhythm. A goal apiece in extra time set up a shoot-out that featured a succession of 22 perfect penalties before Eto\u2019o missed his second spot-kick.\nIn the semi-final Ivory Coast saw off Nigeria, a simple long ball over the top allowing Didier Drogba to exploit a yawning gap at the heart of the Super Eagles\u2019 defence.

But not their pin-up striker, Tottenham\u2019s Mido, after his furious touchline bust-up with the coach, Hassan Shehata, following his substitution in the semi-final against Senegal. Mido had barely sat down when his replacement, the lively Amr Zaki, stabbed home what turned out to be the winning goal, forcing the sulky golden boy, like a third-placed Miss World contestant, to join in the delirious celebrations half-heartedly.

I foresee a time when a hit musical will open in Las Vegas and have a second venue in New York.\"\nGallin, 57, a talent manager for more than 30 years, now oversees the careers of performers such as Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton and Mariah Carey. Over the years he has also handled Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg and Richard Pryor.

Today, Google has announced that it has launched a significant new feature, giving users the ability to share their medical records with designated family or close friends.\nThe general idea behind the feature is that oftentimes during emergencies family members may not know the details of your medical history, like medical allergies. Such information can be lifesaving, but sharing extremely personal medical information is not something that should be taken lightly. Google is taking lengthy measures to ensure the security of the data, associating invite links to specific Email addresses and allowing users to track who has viewed their records. All shared records are also read-only.\nOne security measure that I don\u2019t understand is the 30 day expiration Google Health is placing on each Shared link.

Many people who were in your real estate class are unlikely to be in the business five years from now. While that sounds alarming, it\u2019s your livelihood at stake, so you better pay attention.\nWhy do so many agents fail and quit the business?\nI\u2019ve worked with and studied real estate professionals for a long time, and I\u2019ve identified 10 of the biggest reasons agents fail. Avoiding these pitfalls will help you join that elusive club of agents who survive and succeed in this business. Let\u2019s go!\nJust being interested in your career isn\u2019t enough. When you\u2019re interested, you do things when they\u2019re convenient. Success in real estate is all about diving in head first, being fully committed; this means doing whatever it takes as long as it takes to achieve your goals.\nIf you\u2019re not fully committed, it\u2019s time to reassess your career choice. For more on this topic, watch this previous #TomFerryShow.\nCan you explain your market trends easily? Do you truly know your market? What\u2019s selling? What\u2019s not? You need to be able to answer the questions and those like them in a split second.\nTo survive in real estate, you need to look at your marketplace from a strategic standpoint. You must look at the hot sheets every day.\nYou have to own that knowledge and become the knowledge broker in your market. It\u2019s not enough to simply like houses and enjoy working with people. Take a step back, analyze your market and make sure you know it and your place in it.\nThere\u2019s a lot of vanity in real estate, which can cause agents to shy away from anything that might paint them in an unflattering light.\nBut you can\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes. Mistakes are how we gain wisdom. Accept that it\u2019s okay to make mistakes.\nTry new things, see what works, learn from what doesn\u2019t, and always keep moving forward.\nThe more mistakes you make, the more you\u2019ll bridge that gap between knowing and not knowing, and between success and struggling.\nHaving someone to look up to, to aspire to, to model your behaviors on is a hugely critical step in helping you reach that \u201cnext level\u201d in real estate.\nFar too many agents have no role model for their business. Or they have the wrong one. To accelerate your ascent in this business, find someone who is successful in both life and business, and model your behaviors on theirs.\nFor more on this topic, watch this.\nAs a real estate agent, your No. 1 priority is attracting customers. It\u2019s not a part-time pursuit. Far too many agents do just a little bit of marketing once a week and hope for the best.\nLead generation and lead conversion need to be your primary focus. If there was a way to teach every new agent this philosophy and force them to live up to it, the agent failure rate would decrease dramatically.\nBeing a real estate agent isn\u2019t a job, it\u2019s a business. It\u2019s your business. You\u2019ll get out of it what you put into it.\nEspecially if you\u2019re new, you absolutely must put in the time and effort.

{"idx": "24456", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The word pyx (Lat., pyxis , which transliterates the Greek, pyxis , box-wood receptacle, from pyxos , box-tree) was formerly applied in a wide and general sense to all vessels used to contain the Blessed Eucharist. In particular it was perhaps the commonest term applied to the cup in which the Blessed Sacrament actually rested when in the Middle Ages it was suspended above the altar. Thus the Custumal of Cluny in the eleventh century speaks of the \" deacon taking the golden pyx ( auream pyxidem ) out of the dove ( columba ) which hangs permanently above the altar \". In later times however it has come about that the term pyx is limited in ordinary usage to that smaller vessel of gold, or silver-gilt, in which the Eucharist is commonly carried to the sick. Such vessels are sometimes made flat like a watch, sometimes mounted upon a little stand like a miniature ciborium. From the resemblance in size and shape the word pyx is also used to denote the small silver vessel or custode in which the Sacred Host is commonly kept in the Tabernacle, that it may be transferred thence to the monstrance when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed for the service of Benediction. In the Middle Ages pyxes for carrying the Eucharist to the sick were not unfrequently made of ivory. In spite of synodal decrees it is to be feared that there were many churches both in medieval and later times which preserved no proper pyx for taking Viaticum to the sick. In these cases the custom seems to have prevailed, even if it was not officially tolerated, of carrying the Host wrapped in a corporal in a burse which was suspended round the priest's neck or even of placing it between the leaves of a breviary.\nThe \"pyx-cover\", or \"pyx-cloth\", of which we sometimes read in medieval inventories, was a veil which hung over the pyx as it was suspended above the altar, and it was consequently a cloth of considerable size. At the present day the pyx when carried secretly to the sick, as is the case in most Protestant and many Catholic countries, is generally carried in a burse or pyx-bag, i.e. a silken bag suspended round the priest's neck within which the pyx is wrapped in a diminutive corporal used for that purpose."}

{"idx": "24459", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: \u201cChocolate is chocolate is chocolate, right?\u201d asks food writer Megan Giller. In her new book, \u201cBean to Bar Chocolate: America\u2019s Craft Chocolate Revolution,\u201d Giller answers her own question \u2014 with a definitive no. Across more than 200 pages, the Brooklyn-based author chronicles an increasingly popular process that takes small batch producers from raw cocoa beans to finished single-source chocolate, a process that has more in common with winemaking than industrial candy production. In the book, Giller profiles artisanal makers from across the country and includes recipes and tips for chocolate pairing.\nQ. What do you mean by \u201cbean to bar\u201d?\nA. Chocolate has become this industrial product where we expect it to taste the same every single time. To do that, companies have to manipulate the cocoa beans they\u2019re using and also add some other ingredients. About a decade ago, or a little longer, some Americans started saying,\u201dI really don\u2019t want to eat chocolate like that anymore. I want to see if I can make chocolate without all these extra ingredients and pay attention to flavor and look at cocoa beans like they are wine grapes almost.\u201d So, they stripped out all the other ingredients and just started making bars with cocoa beans and sugar and really focusing on flavor.\nQ. What makes this chocolate different?\nA. Any of the chocolate bars we eat, even if they\u2019re bought at really high-end chocolate shops, most of those are using chocolate that has been premade by a big company, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. There are big companies that make really good chocolate like Valhrona. But (most high-end shops) are buying that premade chocolate, melting it down, and adding maybe sea salt and almonds for example, and turning it into their own specialty bar. That\u2019s a completely different skill set than the kind of chocolate I\u2019m writing about where people are really starting with whole beans and roasting and grinding and turning them into chocolate themselves.\nQ. When you start with beans from a single region, how does that affect flavor?\nA. We have this idea of what chocolate is supposed to be like. Madagascar beans set that on its head. It\u2019s a very fruity, great bean that sometimes can taste like raspberries, sometimes almost lemony or limey. It\u2019s a surprise. There can be lots of nutty flavors. There\u2019s also floral notes. That can be different honeys and flowers and very delicate tastes. It really can go on and on. It\u2019s very rare that (single source chocolate) tastes like one flavor. It is like wine where it can start one way and can change form and finish a different way.\nQ. You like to set up chocolate tastings. How do they work?\nA. There are lots of ways to do it, but I usually try to include anywhere from three to five chocolates. You really don\u2019t need that much of each one. You can set it up so each one is the same percentage (of cacao solids and butter) but has other differences. Maybe they\u2019re all 70\u2009percent single origin but from Madagascar, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Venezuela, something like that. Then you really can taste the difference in terroir between them. Another thing that I think is fun is to try four or five bars from the same maker, then you get a sense of what their style is. You have to start with dark chocolate and then do milk chocolate and then do white. That has to do with the way the milk powder coats your tongue and changes your taste buds a little"}

But I'm unwilling to call for more government authority and encroachment on civil liberties until I'm convinced that existing law and procedures are insufficient.\nThere's a problem with involuntary commitment: it costs money. Publicly-funded money through higher taxes and whatnot. Didn't the United States see massive funding cuts to mental health services since the 1980s? How much, let us ask, does it cost to keep someone with schizophrenia locked up and medicated on a monthly basis?\nThere's a second problem with involuntary commitment: who gets to decide who gets involuntarily committed? Family members holding a grudge against an eccentric relative? A social worker from the local government? Just how bad does someone have to act in public to be determined a mentally unstable threat? Because while those like Loughner might be easy to spot, there have been those who seem perfectly normal or socially well-adjusted who just suddenly snap under stress, and we're never going to be able to spot those right away.\nI recommend everyone listen to the \"This American Life\" episode entitled \"Pro Se\". It details the travails of a person who has tried to prove he is sane enough to be released, but everything he does to show his sanity is considered to be more evidence that he is insane. The individual is not particularly sympathetic, nor was I necessarily convinced that he was sane. But his story about his struggle does make me worry that we should have a better way to consider people able to be released before we start involuntarily committing more of them."}

But rather than provide healthcare to more workers, a growing number of employers are cutting back employee hours instead.\nThe result: Not only will these workers earn less money, but they'll also miss out on health insurance at work.\nConsider the city of Long Beach. It is limiting most of its 1,600 part-time employees to fewer than 27 hours a week, on average. City officials say that without cutting payroll hours, new health benefits would cost up to $2 million more next year, and that extra expense would trigger layoffs and cutbacks in city services.\nPart-timer Tara Sievers, 43, understands why, but she still thinks it's wrong.\n\"I understand there are costs to healthcare reform, but it is surely not the intent of the law for employees to lose hours,\" said the outreach coordinator at the El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach. \"It's ridiculous the city is skirting the law.\"\nAcross the nation, hundreds of thousands of other hourly workers may also see smaller paychecks in the coming year because of this response to the federal healthcare law. The law exempts businesses with fewer than 50 full-time workers from this requirement to provide benefits.\nBut big restaurant chains, retailers and movie theaters are starting to trim employee hours. Even colleges are reducing courses for part-time professors to keep their hours down and avoid paying for their health premiums.\nOverall, an estimated 2.3 million workers nationwide, including 240,000 in California, are at risk of losing hours as employers adjust to the new math of workplace benefits, according to research by UC Berkeley. All this comes at a time when part-timers are being hired in greater numbers as U.S. employers look to keep payrolls lean.\nOne consolation for part-timers is that many of them stand to benefit the most from the healthcare law's federal premium subsidies or an expansion of Medicaid, both starting in January.\nThe law will require most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Yet many lower-income people will qualify for government insurance or be eligible for discounted premiums on private policies.\n\"For people losing a few hours each week, that's lost income and it has a real impact,\" said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. \"But many low-wage, part-time workers will also have some affordable options under the federal law.\"\nEmployers say these cutbacks are necessary given the high cost of providing benefits. The average annual premium for employee-only coverage was $6,540 in California last year. Family coverage topped $16,000 a year. Those premiums have shot up 170% in the past decade, more than five times the rate of inflation in the state.\nBill Dombrowski, chief executive of the California Retailers Assn., said employers are reducing hours because \"it's the only way to survive economically.\"\nThe full effect of these changes in the workplace isn't known yet because many employers are still considering what to do. Many companies waited to see whether the landmark legislation would survive a Supreme Court challenge and the outcome of last fall's presidential election.\nNow many employers are scrambling to understand the latest federal rules on implementation and are analyzing what makes the most sense for their workforce and for running their business.\nThere has been widespread"}

If you're like most people, you carefully reasoned your way to the wrong answer. Because Los Angeles is on the coast, and Reno is in landlocked Nevada, you probably assumed that Los Angeles is farther west. It doesn't matter that you've stared at countless maps or taken a road trip across California \u2013 the atlas that we keep in our head is reliably unreliable.\nColin Ellard, a behavorial neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, probes this and other shortcomings of human spatial intelligence in his delightfully lucid book \"You Are Here.\" (The Canadian version of the book is titled \"Where Am I?\" Apparently, Americans don't like asking for directions.) While modern life is full of tools that keep us from straying off course, from Google maps to the iPhone, Ellard sees the need for such contrivances as a sign that we've already lost our way. We've become hopelessly disconnected from our setting, burdened with a brain that needs a GPS satellite just to get across town.\nThe book begins with a highlight reel of animal navigation skills, which is just another way of showing us how far we've fallen. Ellard argues that the human talent for abstraction \u2013 we can easily imagine places and spaces that don't exist \u2013 comes with a hidden cost, which is that our mental maps of the physical world have become sparser over the course of human evolution. Unlike insects, we can't keep track of the patterns of polarized light; unlike loggerhead turtles, we don't pay attention to magnetic fields; unlike geese, we're not very good at path integration, which is why we have to write down directions that involve multiple turns. Ellard takes great care in explaining the experiments that revealed these astonishing biological talents. He describes, for instance, the research of R\u00fcdiger Wehner, a Swiss scientist who glued tiny stilts made of pig hair to the limbs of desert ants. Because the insects with longer legs consistently overshot the nest and got lost, Wehner demonstrated that ants have an internal odometer: they carefully count their steps when searching for food. (This is only one of the reasons the microscopic ant brain is such a miracle of navigation. Ants can also find their way back from 20,000 body lengths away, which is equivalent to a human being able to remember an uncharted route more than 22 miles long.) The chickadee is no less impressive: it can store food in nearly 80,000 different locations and then find the secret cache as easily as we find the fridge. Humans, meanwhile, can't even keep track of the car keys.\nI go on to discuss Jane Jacobs and why it's best not to wear underwear when navigating on the open sea. If you're interested in the neuroscientific take on navigation, I suggest learning about hippocampal place cells, which are even cooler than mirror neurons."}

Notably, she attracted criticism from the \"Cornish pasty police\" after she made some packed with lamb, apple and peas. \"I got a massive telling off,\" she says, with an equally massive grin. \"What's wrong with changing things around and making them taste different? There's nothing wrong with that. I'm not saying it's the original, I'm just saying it's a different version of it, and I think people are just scared that it might be better than the original.\"\nFood, Hussain says, is meant to be fun and experimented with. \"It's an expression of love.

Yet the level of change, challenge and opportunity across the housing sector presents a smorgasbord of opportunities for the budding entrepreneur. The question is how do we foster this?\nHigh-profile and energetic individuals such as Social Bite\u2019s Josh \u00adLittlejohn have disrupted Scotland\u2019s approach to tackling homelessness by mobilising \u00adthousands of people to raise \u00admillions of pounds to seed the growth of \u00adHousing First. Susan Aktemel has established a social enterprise \u00adletting agency that has secured investment from social impact investors to \u00admanage and deliver homes to those on the periphery of the private rented sector, often excluded by being recipients of housing benefit.\nAn entrepreneurial spirit exists within Scottish Government that has led to the establishment of the LAR Housing Trust and most recently the MMR Fund with PFP Capital. Both will deliver at least 1,000 new homes each through loan funding of more than \u00a390 million that will bring in an additional \u00a3150m through private investment. The MMR Fund only happened due to an entrepreneurial and disruptive mindset within Places for People that recognised the need for the \u00adsector to invent its own future.\nIn 2016, we teamed up with SUNAMP, developers of the world\u2019s first heat battery, and the Scottish Government, to deploy the technology in tackling fuel poverty. At the point we agreed to the joint venture, fewer than 20 systems had been installed. At the end of the project, with more than 600 installations, SUNAMP were at full production and had refined the technology, which has the potential to \u00addisrupt the heat and hot water \u00admarket, delivering increased \u00adcomfort with lower carbon and costs.\nUnderstanding and managing the risks enabled our tenants to benefit from lower energy bills and has \u00adenabled SUNAMP to make a major step in its development.\nFuture opportunities for entrepreneurial activity are vast across our sector, from solutions to compliance monitoring and asset management, to delivery of digital services, \u00adsupporting vulnerable tenants and promoting inclusion to name just a few. Fostering this activity is the responsibility of our sector and this will require a commercial skill set that understands and accepts risk, reducing the time from concept to commercial implementation.\nWorking in partnership with \u00adgovernment and the private sector is key to fostering entrepreneurial talent and tackling some of housing\u2019s knotty problems. This will require financial commitment, space to fail and a willingness to try something new. The longer term benefits will see solutions designed around the needs of tenants and communities, who are often the last to benefit from innovation and economic growth.\nRichard Jennings, managing director, Castle Rock Edinvar."}

{"idx": "24486", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When Compaq bought rival computer-maker Digital last spring, analysts wondered what fate lay in store for AltaVista, Digital's once-prominent, but fading, search engine. Compaq bought Digital, after all, to bolster its high-end hardware and service offerings for corporate customers. Where did a search engine fit in?\nIt seemed likely that AltaVista would wither on the vine. But it didn't.\nFirst, Compaq (CPQ) shelled out $3.35 million dollars to buy the rights to the altavista.com URL, replacing the clunky altavista.digital.com moniker. Next, the company poured $10 million dollars into fleshing out the site's services.\nTuesday, it unveiled the results: multiple new search options and the familiar channel design favored by the portal big-shots, features intended to push AltaVista onto the portal playing field as a direct competitor to the likes of Yahoo, while building on its core strength as a search engine.\n\"Our goal is to convert AltaVista from the number ten site to the number one, two, or three site over the next several years,\" said Kurt Losert, vice president of Internet services at Compaq, and the acting general manager of AltaVista.\nSince Compaq assumed stewardship of AltaVista six months ago, distribution deals with Microsoft and Netscape, along with other partnerships, have driven traffic to the site up nearly 50 percent, according to Losert.\nAltaVista now averages between 32 million and 36 million daily page views. That makes it the tenth most visited site on the Web, based on a recent survey by Web-rating firm RelevantKnowledge. Aggressive marketing and distribution partnerships will quickly push AltaVista up the ratings ladder, said Losert, who predicts traffic will grow another 50 percent in the next 6 months.\nWhen it comes to driving traffic to its site, Compaq has a unique advantage: hardware. Compaq is the world's number one seller of PCs, and every new net-enabled Presario PC that Compaq sells has an Internet search button on the keyboard that automatically whisks surfers to the AltaVista site.\nIt works the other way, too. Compaq's Net offerings help sell PCs. Compaq offers a $100 rebate to any Presario-buyer that signs up for Internet access through a co-branded offering with GTE. The rebate allows Compaq to undercut competitors in the white-hot market for bargain-basement PCs.\n\"The combination of the base price of the Presario, plus the rebate, is unmatched,\" said Losert. \"We intend to combine the power and scope of the company's distribution with hardware and software integration to provide complete, end-to-end service integration\" for Internet users."}

Yet that is no reason to throw up our hands, glibly excusing our lackluster educational performance by claiming that \"forces beyond our control\" are making it practically impossible for schools to function at all or for children to learn much in them.\nAlmost every time I talk with educators, someone seeks to assign primary responsibility for weak academic achievement to heedless parents, decaying families, changes in the ethnic or socioeconomic composition of the students, drugs and alcohol, violence on television, bad role models in the neighborhood, and so forth. Nobody has yet mentioned sunspots, but almost every other imaginable non-school influence has been suggested.\nI generally respond by recalling Lester Maddox, the infamous ax- handle-wielding, segregation-minded former governor of Georgia. When asked how he proposed to improve the sorry condition of the state prison system, Mr. Maddox replied: \"There's not a lot more we can do unless we start getting a better class of prisoner.\"\nHe had part of a valid point, to be sure. Prisons would obviously be more tractable and tranquil places if only nice people were incarcerated in them. Their rehabilitation rates would probably be up, recidivism down. Yet those questioning Mr. Maddox should not have been satisfied by his rejoinder. For a public official in his position to suggest that we can shrug our shoulders, that there is no more to be done until some improvement takes place in the condition of those entering the prison walls--well, one might as usefully respond to drought by praying for rain or to arthritis by donning a copper bracelet.\nI can think of no institution that would not have an easier time producing satisfactory results if those with whom it deals were not so sorely afflicted. Hospitals would have a terrific cure rate if nobody presented maladies more serious than hangnails and head colds. Defense attorneys would win many more acquittals if all their clients were innocent.\nAnd schools would enjoy greater success if every child were ready and eager to learn, had supportive parents and no serious personal4problems, and the neighborhood were peaceful and other community institutions available and active. In the same vein, we know that the school faces a far harder task when other influences undermine and contradict its lessons. We will surely need to devise means of boosting its leverage, and these are likely to include increasing the fraction of their lives that children spend under its influence. Yet it little avails us as educators to cast about for scapegoats, to yearn for a better class of students, to blame forces beyond our control, or to insist that society's other shortcomings be set right before we can begin to do our part. The challenge of the 1990's is to wrestle our education system into such a shape that it can do its part, meeting the cognitive learning needs of a modern society as well as those of its individual students, even when other conditions are unhealthy.\nIts shape will have to change considerably, and changing it will doubtless bring discomfort. We are talking, after all, of whipping our sluggish couch potato of an education system into one resembling Jane Fonda or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Many of its longtime assumptions and standard practices will need to be replaced. Above all, we will need to hold our schools--all of them--responsible and accountable for the results achieved within"}

Lancers RB Mario Padilla called Saguaro \"the definition of 4A football in the state of Arizona\", earlier this week at practice.\nThe game was scoreless heading in to the 2nd quarter, before Sabercats QB found Logan Pettijohn for a 36 yard touchdown.

But the law in question, the Iran Sanctions Act, is set to expire in late 2016.\nSkeptics of the Iran deal, including Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) want to go ahead and renew ISA now through 2026. They argue that extending the act would send a signal that the U.S. is serious about its willingness to \u201csnap back\u201d sanctions if Iran fails to dismantle much of its nuclear program or otherwise cheats.\nThe White House, however, is urging lawmakers to hold off. The official argument, made in congressional hearings and other forums by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and fellow administration officials, is that it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to extend ISA now. When pressed to expand on their reasoning, administration officials go only slightly beyond that talking point, saying they support eventual renewal of ISA, but not now.\nWhat\u2019s left unstated is the possibility that Iran would view a renewal of ISA as a provocation \u2014 perhaps grounds to allege the U.S. is violating the agreement before it\u2019s even fully implemented \u2014 and that extending it could affect the political dynamics in Tehran, where hardliners also oppose the deal.\nRegardless, the administration\u2019s vague answers on ISA is puzzling many lawmakers and risks squandering potential good will in Congress.\nThose potential allies include Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, perhaps the only Republican still undecided on the deal. Last week, during a speech on the floor about the agreement, he pointed to the ISA renewal as a stumbling block.\n\u201cThe degree to which the administration has resisted even the suggestion that Congress reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act, for example, which expires next year, just so that we might have sanctions to snap back, makes us question our willingness to confront Iran when it really matters down the road,\u201d Flake said.\nThe GOP-led Congress is expected to vote against the nuclear deal in September, but the president has promised a veto, and for now it appears lawmakers won\u2019t be able to override him. It\u2019s clear, however, that opponents of the deal are looking at ways they can strengthen U.S. sanctions on Iran even if the nuclear agreement is implemented.\nSen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently said an ISA extension would probably pass not long after Congress finishes its debate on the Iran deal, even if the government in Tehran bristles over it.\nOther lawmakers have raised the possibility of imposing new sanctions on Iran for actions unrelated to its nuclear program. Already under the agreement, the U.S. will retain sanctions on the country linked to terrorism, human rights abuses and its ballistic missile program, so lawmakers could expand on those.\nAdministration officials warn, however, that Congress cannot take existing nuclear-related sanctions and simply relabel them without violating the agreement.

Blacks' views are more positive now than they were in 1963, when 74% thought whites had better chances at jobs. Blacks have felt disadvantaged versus whites in terms of job hiring in all but a couple of instances over the last 50 years.\nThe results, based on an Aug. 9-22 Gallup poll of 1,001 blacks, suggest some progress on this front in the 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech laid out his vision of racial equality in the United States. However, with blacks continuing to feel the odds are stacked against them in hiring, they suggest King's vision has not been fully realized in this respect.\nWhen Gallup asked the same question of a national sample in a June 13-July 5 poll, Americans overall were much more positive than blacks about equality of job opportunities for blacks -- 68% of Americans said blacks have as good a chance as whites to get jobs for which they are qualified, while 31% disagreed.\nBlacks' perceptions about equality in childhood education are more positive than their views of equality of job opportunities. Fifty-six percent of blacks believe that black children have the same chance as white children in their community to get a good education, while 43% believe black children do not have the same chance.\nWhile positive on balance, the results are essentially unchanged since King's days. In 1962, 53% of blacks said black children had educational opportunities equal to whites' opportunities. And today's results are less positive than what Gallup measured from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, when as many as 68% said black and white children had the same opportunity to get a good education.\nBlacks are also less optimistic than Americans overall about educational opportunities. In the June-July poll, 77% of Americans believed black children have the same chance as white children to get a good education, while 23% said that is not the case. These views have changed little in the last 50 years; in 1962, 83% of Americans perceived equality of educational opportunity.\nA narrow majority of blacks, 51%, say blacks have as good a chance as whites to get any housing they can afford, while 48% disagree. This question, dating from 1989, does not have as long a history as the questions on job and educational opportunities. Over this time, blacks have typically been divided or slightly more optimistic than pessimistic about equal housing opportunities.\nEarlier this year, in the national poll, 79% of Americans said blacks had equal opportunities for housing, while 20% said they did not. Those views are more positive than the ones Gallup measured in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nA separate question in the poll asked blacks directly whether they thought discrimination was mostly the reason blacks tend to have lower income, jobs, and housing than whites. Forty percent see discrimination as the major reason for these economic disparities by race, while 57% think it is due to factors apart from discrimination.\nSlightly fewer blacks now perceive discrimination to be at work in economic matters than in 1993, 40% versus 44%.\nBlacks are more likely to see discrimination at work in the greater prevalence of black"}

As a result, we do not want to comment until that process is completed. I have instructed members of the organization not to talk about this issue and get our focus back on the field and winning baseball games.\"\nSaid Eaton: \"You see the reach a lot of people have made. Adam sees that as God put me into this position to make a decision. I made the decision I made. And it\u2019s sending shock waves through not only the sports world, but so many different media channels.\nThe White Sox players have asked for the Major League Baseball Players Association's involvement, with Eaton and Sale each saying that LaRoche had a clause in his contract permitting his son to be with him as much as possible. Yet, it appears it was only a handshake agreement, and there would be no basis for the union to step in and permit LaRoche\u2019s son to continue being with the team.\nThe White Sox players say they were hoping to change Williams\u2019 mind during Tuesday's contentious two-hour meeting, but instead, became infuriated, even threatening to boycott Wednesday\u2019s spring-training game.\n\u201cKenny said quite a few things,\u2019\u2019 Sale said, \u201ccontradicting statements a couple of times.\n\"We've been told three different stories, so we don't know who to believe, or even who to believe it originated from. First, he said it was the players (who complained about LaRoche\u2019s son). Then went to the coaches. Then came in here and told us it was the owner. I think if the right person had handled it, it would have been completely different.\n\u201cWe have a much bigger problem on our hands than Kenny coming in here and kicking out a kid, and 'Roche retiring. That's the unfortunate part of all this. But at the end of the day, it wasn't the right thing.\nDrake LaRoche, who is home-schooled, has been by his dad\u2019s side for the last five years, a welcome presence in the Washington Nationals' spring training and regular season activities before his father signed a two-year, $26 million contract with the White Sox before the 2015 season.\nHe was a staple in the clubhouse, complete with his own locker and uniform.

While there, he will likely push the Palestinian agenda and lobby for full membership to the United Nations. Were he to succeed, U.S. law prohibits funding U.N.-affiliated organizations that accept the P.A. as a member state, and the United States would therefore be required to cut all funding of the United Nations.\nLast July, the Group of 77, a U.N. bloc that includes 134 developing countries, elected the head of the Palestinian mission, Riyad Mansour, as its next leader for 2019.\nThe Palestinian mission to the United Nations was granted observer status in 2012, making it eligible to join U.N. bodies such as the International Criminal Court and UNESCO.\nHowever, because the Palestinians have the status of a non-member state at the United Nations, which would have made them ineligible for the chairmanship of the bloc without a special vote, the U.N. General Assembly held one last October to temporarily elevate the Palestinians\u2019 status at the world body to resolve the issue.\nWhile it may appear that the Palestinians are slowly managing to achieve their goal of achieving full U.N. membership and being upgraded from observer to member-state status, the likelihood of this happening still remains slim.\nAt the same time, an upgrade to full membership at the world body for the Palestinians would require support from the Security Council, where the United States holds veto power.\nShaked said that Abbas had a good relationship with President Barack Obama and also with U.S. President Donald Trump in the beginning of the latter\u2019s presidency. But that relationship soured when Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nShe also said that while Abbas is ready to reopen the relationship with the United States, he doesn\u2019t want Jared Kushner to serve in the role as special advisor to the president on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Abbas wants Trump to remove him. This won\u2019t happen because changing out Kushner means changing policy."}

Though the future of Superman films is currently in question due to Henry Cavill\u2019s reported exit from DC (though his agent and Warner Bros. have denied that anything is set in stone on that front), recent rumors have indicated that a big screen version of Supergirl is in the early stages of development.\nAmong these rumors is that Morano, who has directed episodes of both Billions and the highly acclaimed The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (for which Morano won an Emmy n 2017), is currently Warner Bros.' frontrunner to direct the movie. This would certainly be in line with the studio\u2019s recent track record of hiring female directors for female superhero adaptations, which includes Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman and Cathy Yan\u2019s upcoming Birds of Prey film. Regardless, Morano and Warner Bros. have both remained quiet about the aforementioned speculation, until now.\nThough Morano is denying any current involvement with Supergirl, if talks with Warner Bros. were actually happening, it\u2019s just as likely the director would not reveal that publicly. However, it seems more likely at the moment that the rumor of Morano directing Supergirl was one created by someone who'd like to see that happen, and doesn't have a factual basis. Regardless, even if Warner Bros. doesn't have Morano on their radar, it\u2019s completely plausible she could end up there at some point. Fans will simply have to wait and see.\nWherever DC ends up landing in regards to a director for Supergirl, the rumors surrounding the film\u2019s plot are just as intriguing to consider. From unconfirmed speculation that the movie will be set in the 1970s to equally unsubstantiated reports that well-known Superman villain Brainiac will be stepping into the villain role, there's currently a lot of online discussion among fans concerning what is or isn't true regarding the project.

It entails disrupting the dominance of Western schools of knowledge.\nAccording to incoming club president Chris Koenig \u201919, existing problems within the education system are structural and multi-faceted.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t begin at any specific point but has to be attacked on different fronts at the same time,\u201d Koenig said.\nFor example, Koenig mentioned the Who\u2019s Teaching Us movement as one perspective from which to address educational issues. The movement seeks to evaluate the process through which Stanford recruits its professors with consideration of factors such as race and personal background. Koenig believes that such a campaign will be helpful in recruiting professors who can empathize with the experiences of minority students.\nIn January, the club hosted a three-day event called \u201cPower TranSFER: Healing, Hope, & Education.\u201d The event focused on helping marginalized students as well as scholars reclaim power in academic contexts by considering how to validate knowledge created by marginalized community members. Targeted at both the graduate and undergraduate community, the program consisted of a research component, an open mic night and a discussion panel.\nThe open mic took place in El Centro Latino y Chicano. According to Suenaga, students told their stories and experiences in the classroom, such as whether a professor had asked them to speak on behalf of their race, or when a professor did not seem to understand the difficulties of being a first-generation college student. Suenaga emphasized that validating the experiences of students from marginalized groups and supporting them in changing systemic inequities is an important step for all students to take.\nThe event also included a panel discussion, including University of California Santa Cruz philosophy of education professor Ronald David Glass, who provided context for how education-related activism has progressed over the years, and East Palo Alto Stanford Academy (EPASA) director Priscila Garcia, who facilitates partnerships between local middle schoolers and Stanford students through Stanford\u2019s Haas Center for Public Service, among others.\nAccording to Koenig, SAJE\u2019s incoming president, the event included a workshop on the relationship between research and decoloniality done in coordination with Green Library.\n\u201cThinking about how we can leverage the people and resources that are already here and share knowledge in new ways was really exciting,\u201d Koenig said.\nPhillips said that, in conceptualizing and planning the event, the club drew inspiration from Latin American thought movements centered on the ways in which colonial ideology is embedded in the way that we learn.\nAccording to Koenig, teaching methodology is another important factor in the quality of education that students receive. He said that the classroom structure, tradition and legacy have impacts both in the classroom and in research since they affect the type of knowledge that is generated and disseminated.

{"idx": "24525", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Fashion designer Chi Atanga is comfortable with an identity as a global African.\nBased in Portugal and Cameroonian-British by background, he is currently in the U.S. looking for investment and sounding out potential markets. African-American communities are emerging consumers of music, movies and fashion from the continent, he says, and he hopes to ride the wave with a clothing brand that reflects his heritage.\nFor the time being, however, his Walls of Benin brand will be manufactured in Europe. His first line will be produced in Porto, Portugal, where he has access to a skilled workforce, reliable infrastructure and support from the European Union -- all prerequisites for building a competitive fashion business which are still missing from most Sub-Saharan African markets.\n\"Personally I'm drawn to Cameroon and to West Africa,\" Atanga says, \"but private enterprise is difficult in Cameroon.\"\nOn the World Bank's 2016 'Doing Business' ranking, Cameroon placed 172 out of 189 countries, scoring particularly badly on the ease of trading across borders. Expensive electricity connections and poor transport infrastructure add huge amounts of cost to manufacturing businesses in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, meaning that they often struggle to compete with businesses in other regions.\nFashion, along with other creative sectors, could be one way to overcome these barriers, as demand for unique designs and intellectual property from Africa increases.\nAtanga insists that he believes in the power of enterprise as a way to bring people out of poverty, and in the need to move African economies up commercial value chains and away from simply exporting raw materials. But to have that impact, he says, his company would need to be large enough and robust enough to overcome the challenges that most of the continent's economies present.\n\"We don't want to use Africa as a gimmick,\" he says. \"We need to have scale, we need to have a name and a reputation.\"\nInvestors in the U.S. have shown some interest, and Atanga is hoping to fund his first line through a crowdfunding campaign in December. After that, he will look again at finding a base in Africa. Rather than the west of the continent, he believes that Rwanda and Ethiopia, both of which have created 'special economic zones' that offer tax breaks for light manufacturing businesses.\nEthiopia in particular has made a strong play for textiles and garments manufacturers, building the infrastructure -- in partnership with Chinese companies -- to host factories making shoes and clothes for major international brands. The country hopes that increasing costs in Asian markets will make its relatively inexpensive labor force an attractive prospect.\nAfrican SMEs working in fashion face the same challenges as most other enterprises across the continent, according to Vanessa Erogbogbo, who works with a number of fashion and textile entrepreneurs in Ethiopia as the manager of the International Trade Center's Women and Trade program.\nEntrepreneurs -- particularly women -- often struggle to access finance to grow and access international markets. Erogbogbo advises the women that she works with to focus on unique, niche products that can differentiate them from their international competition.\n\"When we look at fashion and textiles and garments, the buyers are prescriptive, they want you to show them something that would interest them. You have to be quite creative,\" she says.\nThe small-scale, women-owned companies that Erogbogbo works with have added appeal to conscious consumers, who care that the products contribute to better livelihoods in their country of origin. Proving the provenance of African products is important, but perhaps more so"}

LeMond, winner of this year's World Championships and Tour de France, will sign a three-year, $5.7-million contract with the French club, Team Z, his attorney said Tuesday.\nWhen he signs at a ceremony in Paris, LeMond, 28, will become the highest-paid bike rider ever. LeMond will receive base salaries of $1.8 million next year, $1.92 million in 1991 and $2 million in the last year of the contract. He can earn bonuses of $200,000 for winning the Tour de France, $100,000 for winning the World Championships, and $50,000 for winning the Tour of Italy or any World Cup event. Another clause in LeMond's contract calls for the entire Z team to use a bike that LeMond designed and that carries his name.\nHis joining a French team is something of a surprise. LeMond, of Wayzata, Minn., has publicly expressed his interest in signing with a U.S. team. That preference led to a bidding war between the Coors and 7-Eleven teams.\nLeMond already rides for the Coors Light team in a series of races in the United States, so that was attractive. On the other hand, 7-Eleven is the only U.S. team to campaign in Europe, where nearly all the prestigious races are held. However, 7-Eleven's stock dropped when it became clear that the team would have to enlist a co-sponsor to support a LeMond-led team. Coors was in the same position.\nThe lack of financial commitment by those sponsors to the European tour eventually sent LeMond and his advisers looking to European teams.\n\"The problems came to a head at the World Championships (last month in France),\" LeMond's attorney, Nathan Jenkins, said from his office in Reno. \"We negotiated diligently with 7-Eleven and Coors. But it was clear that they did not have the financial commitment to cycling that the Europeans have.\"\nJenkins said LeMond--who is criticized by some in the sport for his businesslike approach and the unprecedented amounts of endorsement money he has commanded--did not take the highest offer. That bidder was the French-based Toshiba team, which offered $200,000 more per year. Jenkins said LeMond had, by that point, established a good rapport with Team Z and had all but made his decision.\nJenkins said that part of LeMond's initial reluctance to sign with another European team was his bad experience with his former team, ADR of Belgium. According to Jenkins, that team owes LeMond $300,000 in salary and has been in breach of the contract. LeMond announced after winning the Tour de France in July that he would leave ADR, even though the contract had a year remaining.\nADR officials say LeMond broke the contract and have threatened to sue. Jenkins said he has not been contacted by ADR's attorneys.\nTeam Z was the No. 10 team in the world in 1988, when it was known as Z-Peugeot. LeMond's contract is with Team Z.

That's on top of the 115 accounts Facebook shut down earlier this week and the 652 pages, groups and accounts removed in August.\nFacebook said the additional accounts were identified after a website that claimed to be associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency published a list of Instagram accounts it says it created. Facebook said it had blocked most of the listed accounts already and has now blocked the rest.\n\"This is a timely reminder that these bad actors won't give up,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber security policy, said in a statement.\nU.S. tech companies have stepped up efforts to fight disinformation campaigns by Russian groups, whom authorities accuse of swaying the 2016 presidential election. The companies were caught embarrassingly off-guard then. This time around, there are clear signs they are making some progress.\nSam Gill of the nonprofit John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which recently commissioned a study on misinformation on social media, said that while tech companies cannot declare victory yet, \"the leaders of the companies don't talk any more that it isn't a problem \u2014 they talk about how important it is to get it right.\"\nThat's in contrast to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's now-infamous quip in November 2016 calling the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the elections \"pretty crazy.\"\nBut social media companies still have work to do . By some measures, the spread of fake news on Facebook has declined since 2016, but the same can't always be said for Twitter.\nThe Knight study on misinformation points to a central problem that has emerged since 2016: It isn't just Russian agents spreading misinformation. Plenty of homegrown sites are at it, too.\nThe study found that fake news is still being spread on Twitter, the vast majority from just a few sources.\nGill said that, at this point, we simply \"don't know enough\" to say how the spread of misinformation has changed since 2016. That's despite a slew of academic studies that attempt to measure the spread and consumption of fake news on these services.\n\"We need a lot more basic research studying the relationship between social media and democracy,\" he said. \"We need to see more and understand more from the companies. We need access to more information.\"\nLong criticized for not giving academic researchers access to its data, Facebook launched a program in April designed to address this issue \u2014 though only when it comes to elections. The initiative solicits proposals from outside researchers, then works with Facebook to give researchers access to Facebook data. Facebook doesn't get to pre-approve research and provides no funding.\nBut until there is more research, social media companies must contend with present-day problems around misinformation, hate and propaganda, playing whack-a-mole as new fake accounts and trolls pop up trying to misuse their services.\nAfter all, the 2020 presidential election is less than two years away \u2014 and jockeying for that"}

The outcome of their deliberations could alter the financial landscape at a time when Baltimore-based Constellation and others are considering whether to invest billions of dollars in new power plants to help solve Maryland's projected energy shortfall.\nSome industry analysts said yesterday that the lack of an agreement on re-regulation could factor into Constellation's decision over whether to build a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs in Lusby. It also could affect other proposed power plant projects, which some argue will be critical to preventing electricity rates from rising further. Maryland imports about 30 percent of its electricity - a shortage that has helped drive wholesale energy prices up 85 percent over pre-deregulation rates.\n\"Generally speaking, the more uncertainty there is, the more likely a decision like that will be put off or delayed,\" said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates in New York.\nThe deal reached Monday seems designed in part to prevent that from happening. It states that Constellation, the parent company of Baltimore Gas and Electric, will give preference to Maryland when deciding where to build a new nuclear plant. The company had said previously it might build in New York to avoid Maryland's volatile political environment.\nThe settlement also includes a provision allowing an investor to buy up to 20 percent of Constellation's shares without triggering a regulatory review by the Public Service Commission. That could clear the way for Paris-based EDF Group, which has partnered with Constellation to develop nuclear power plants in the United States, to provide cash to finance the Calvert Cliffs project.\nWhile remaining vague about its plans, Constellation said yesterday that the deal with lawmakers is a step forward.\n\"Looking ahead, BGE customers gain a number of tangible benefits as does Constellation Energy, which will be better positioned to attract the capital necessary to invest in key strategic initiatives,\" said Rob Gould, a spokesman for the company.\nPatterson and other industry analysts saw benefits in the deal, despite the unresolved issues. And Fitch Ratings, a major credit-ratings agency, took Constellation off credit watch negative yesterday in light of the agreement with lawmakers. Some analysts see the deal as an opportunity for the parties to alter the tone in the re-regulation debate.\nGov. Martin O'Malley's administration is trying to walk a fine line between collaborating with Constellation, while still getting consumer-friendly changes to the state's regulatory scheme.\n\"It means working to ensure we are increasing generation, including working with Constellation and the federal government on that third reactor at Calvert Cliffs, but doing so in a way that is fair to ratepayers,\" said Rick Abbruzzese, an O'Malley spokesman.\nThe PSC has put forth a series of potential regulatory fixes in recent reports to lawmakers. Key among them is a plan to partially re-regulate the industry by requiring utilities to enter into long-term contracts with power plants. The idea is to spur construction of new generation by providing a guaranteed stream of revenue for suppliers, who would have to compete for the contracts and build the plants.\nProponents say it is an improvement over the current system"}

The interview aired Thursday.\nTrump has lashed out repeatedly in the past at Sessions, the Alabama Republican who was the first senator to endorse the celebrity businessman but then recused himself shortly after taking office from the special counsel investigation that led to the criminal cases and is still underway into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\nTrump tried to play down his relationship with Cohen, his longtime \u201cfixer,\u201d who claims the president directed a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of two women who say they had affairs with Trump. The president contends Cohen only worked for him part time and accuses the lawyer of making up stories to reduce his legal exposure.\nTrump made the comments as his White House struggled to manage the fallout from Cohen\u2019s plea deal and the conviction of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Manafort on financial charges. The president suggested that Cohen\u2019s legal trouble stemmed from his other businesses, including involvement with the New York City taxi cab industry.\nThe back-to-back legal blows have raised speculation that Democrats would launch impeachment proceedings if they win the House of Representatives this fall. Trump argued such a move would have dire economic consequences.\nYet his White House signaled no clear strategy for managing the fallout. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted at least seven times at a briefing that Trump had done nothing wrong and was not the subject of criminal charges. She referred substantive questions to the president\u2019s personal counsel Rudy Giuliani, who was at a golf course in Scotland. Outside allies of the White House said they had received little guidance on how to respond to the events in their appearances on cable news. And it was not clear the West Wing was assembling any kind of coordinated response.\nThat Cohen was in trouble was no surprise; federal prosecutors raided his offices months ago. But Trump and his allies were caught off-guard when Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes, which, for the first time, took the swirling criminal probes directly to the president.\nSome Democrats are openly discussing the possibility of impeaching Trump if they should take control of the House in November\u2019s elections."}

Once your hometown, average annual precipitation in said city, age and occupation are established in rapid-fire succession, though, it's time for the second tier of questions.\nFor English speaking visitors, the quiz goes as follows: Why are you Americans always shooting each other? How come so many people like Bush? Why do you English love the Queen so much? Can you explain Northern Ireland in 10 sentences or less?\nOnly after you've proven your reliability on the political front will Germans try to establish some common ground. And they're likely to start with what they view as an easy one: What do you think of \"Dinner for One?\"\n\u0093You know -- dinner for one; James; Miss Sophie; same procedure as every year?\" And then they break into an uncontrolled fit of the hysterical giggles.\nThe native English speaker is at this stage completely flummoxed -- what on earth is this crazy kraut going on about? Then between snickers and guffaws, your otherwise quite sober and serious new friend will start to explain the phenomenon. Every New Year\u0092s Eve everybody -- yes really EVERYBODY -- in Germany watches a black and white short film, in English, about an aristocratic lady and her butler. And they are astonished that you have never heard of it. Given its astounding popularity in Germany, they assume that it must be a huge hit elsewhere in the world -- and they feel flattered to have been lucky enough to get in on the big British joke.\nIt's a terrible blow to the average German's weltanschauung when they find out that most Americans, Brits, Irishmen, Scots, South Africans, Canadians and New Zealanders haven't a clue what \"Dinner for One\" is all about. Only the Australians, it seems, have been introduced to the pleasures of this particular bit of black-and-white television buffoonery.\nSo what exactly is \u0093Dinner for One\u0094 and why does it have such a hold on the German imagination? The story is pretty basic. Miss Sophie is a dotty old lady celebrating her 90th birthday in what she likes to imagine is the presence of her old pals.

Rather, he's a bit of an old codger and cavorts across the screen in convincing slapstick manner, increasingly slurring his words and fighting with a tendency to trip over a tiger skin rug.

{"idx": "24558", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As tax reform debates continue in Washington, here are five issues that have come up in the past week alone.\nOver the past week tax reform has dominated the political cycle in Washington D.C.\nOn Thursday, the House of Representatives took a necessary step toward tax reform when it approved $1.5 trillion in deficit spending for tax cuts on a near-party line vote. This has caused significant pushback from Democrats, who have resurrected the GOP's Obama-era language of fiscal responsibility to criticize the bill.\nAt the same time, the particulars of the plan remain unfinished. Although the House has approved the spending Republican leaders are still drafting the actual bill, with some reports suggesting that they plan to unveil it on November 1.\nAs the tax reform debate continues in Washington, here are a few of the most important developments over the past week.\nThe Council of Economic Advisors has recently predicted that cutting corporate taxes to 20% will cause household incomes to grow anywhere from $4,000 to $9,000 per year. Their argument is that allowing investors to keep a larger share of profits will lead to a surge of capital into the market. This will, advocates argue, lead to an increase in business investment and productivity, in turn creating a more competitive labor marketplace and a trickle-down increase in wages all around.\nThere is no reason to believe that this will happen.\nIn fiscal year 2017, the U.S. Treasury collected $297 billion in corporate income taxes. According to FactCheck.org, raising the average household income by only $4,000 would cost more than $503 billion per year. This amount calculates only the money directly flowing to those households, not the net economic activity it would take to push that money down in the form of increased pay after accounting for corporate spending, profits and dividends.\nTo realize advocates' most conservative claim, this cut would have to generate new economic activity worth more than twice as much as the total pre-reform corporate income tax base. No tax cut in history has generated this kind of growth, and steadily increasing corporate profits over the past 30 years have tracked most closely with the expansion of executive pay and shareholder compensation rather than wage growth.\nIncreasing corporate liquidity, on its own, does not necessarily lead to wage growth, and few credible economists believe it will happen in this case either.\nForeign shareholders will take home approximately three times as much in tax relief as American households.\nThis is the conclusion of new, widely celebrated research by the Tax Policy Center's Steve Rosenthal. In his work, Rosenthal finds that foreign investors own over a third of U.S. corporate stock. With a 15-point corporate rate cut they will collect a short-term, highly predictable benefit of approximately $70 billion per year compared to the estimated $23 billion per year in tax relief planned for the middle class. As Paul Krugman points out, this amounts to $700 billion over the likely ten-year lifetime of this bill.\n\"The question of who wins from slashing corporate taxes has been obscured by a debate over what happens in the long run,\" said Rosenthal. \"Some economists argue that in the long run a small benefit from the cutting of corporate taxes will go to the workers. Other economists argue that in the long run a large benefit from cutting corporate taxes will go to the workers.\"\nBut, he said, \"That's quite a tenuous chain of events that need to occur, and those occur over many, many years. In the meantime what we do know in the short run is that the winners are stockholders both"}

On Wednesday, the school board will hear a report on the charter school's progress.\n\"I think we have everything pretty much lined up,\" said Spear Lancaster, spokesman for the Hanover school.\nCounty Board President Konrad Wayson said that although the board and the county school system have been working with the charter school's founders to keep the school open, what happens next will depend on what the report says and how much progress the school has made.\n\"At this point, I don't know what could happen,\" said Wayson, who added that he has not seen the report on the school's progress. \"It could be anything.\"\nChesapeake Science Point, which opened in the fall, focuses on math, science and technology. Although the school had some stumbles at the start of the school year, the bigger problems began in March, when police removed then-director Jon Omural from the school.\nOmural was placed on leave by school system officials after personnel complaints and union grievances were filed against him by three teachers, who were reassigned to other county schools. Omural resigned.\nThose actions led to an investigation into the management and operating procedures of the school, and, ultimately, to the \"letter of cure\" that was given to the charter school's board last month.\nLancaster said that architects have drawn new plans for how the school's classrooms can be divided within the rented industrial park space the school inhabits. The fire marshal's office visited the school last week to make sure all was in order.\nThe Chesapeake Science Point board has two candidates to take over the operation of the school: Fatih Kandil, who most recently ran a charter school in Ohio, and Judith Henry, a retired Prince George's County principal. However, Lancaster acknowledged that Kandil does not hold certification in Maryland to be a school administrator, an issue that also was a problem with Omural.\nAs far as the bookkeeping and paperwork issues raised by the school system, Lancaster said he thinks that those are in order.\nLancaster emphasized that Chesapeake Science Point's board members, founders and parents are doing everything they can to be in compliance with the school system's regulations.\nA survey of teachers and parents at the school shows that most are satisfied and would like to see the school remain open, he said. Only one teacher is not returning next year, and of 103 students who ended the year there, five have said they will not be returning. The school will take in an additional 50 students in the fall, as it expands to sixth grade.\nBut Wayson said that the school's finances remain his top concern.\n\"Do they have enough money to support the school?\" Wayson said. \"...

Russia\u2019s Nuclear Sub fleet it is not a debate. Obviously the coup in Ukraine instigated by US puppet Nazi fascists jeopardized that important geographical base Crimea. The USA would have done the same w/o question to any important base had a Coup occurred & jeopardized one of it\u2019s bases. We know the base is Crimea was leased from Ukraine & LP / Gas were exchanged at a discounted rate in fair trade. In fact Russia has forgiven some of the outstanding owed debt. The Balaklava Nuclear submarine base working in close association with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet stationed at Sevastopol. It\u2019s really not that difficult to follow or see where this goes w/ the NATO build up & aggression surrounding Russia. Yet not one SAT photo of Russian Tanks inside Ukraine or troops other than Russian troop build up in Russia in defensive positions & drills. To be expected certainly.\nIn order to achieve its goals in Asia, the US needs to push NATO further eastward, tighten its encirclement of Russia, and control the flow of oil and gas from east to west. These are the necessary preconditions for establishing US hegemonic rule over the continent. And this is why the Obama administration is so invested in Kiev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blundering junta-government; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Washington needs Poroshenko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neo Nazi shock troops to draw Russia into a conflagration in Ukraine that will drain its resources, discredit Putin in the eyes of his EU trading partners, and create the pretext for deploying NATO to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s western border.\nThe idea that Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proxy army in Ukraine is defending the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereignty is pure bunkum. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on below the surface is the US is trying to stave off irreversible economic decline and an ever-shrinking share of global GDP through military force. What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing in Ukraine today, is a 21st century version of the Great Game implemented by political fantasists and Koolaid drinkers who think they can turn the clock back to the post WW2 heyday of the US Empire when the world was America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oyster. Thankfully, that period is over.\nNATO encirclement, the U.S.-backed coup in Ukraine, an attempt to use an agreement with the European Union to bring NATO into Ukraine at the Russian border, a U.S. nuclear first-strike policy, are all policies which attempt to substitute force for diplomacy.\nRussia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the terror unleashed by western-backed neo-nazis in Crimea and Odessa came after the local population appealed to Russia to protect them from the violence. Russia then agreed to Crimea joining the Russian Federation, a reaffirmation of an historic relationship.\nThe Western press begins its narrative on the Crimea situation with the annexation, but completely ignores the provocations by the West and other causal factors which resulted in the annexation. This distortion of reality is artificially creating an hysteria about Russian aggressiveness, another distortion which could pose an exceptionally dangerous situation for the world, if acted upon by other nations.

Its arc is derivative as hell, but at least it exists: There\u2019s a shape to the narrative rather than a desperate flailing from one direction to another. Whether this actually constitutes an improvement rather than a lateral move is still up for grabs. It\u2019s not as if the writing and the acting have improved all that much, but they\u2019re now in service of something more\u2026normal. But is that really what we want from our Dome?\nThat\u2019s not to say the show has completely abandoned its nuttier side, not in an episode where Big Jim slices open mad scientist Frank Whaley\u2019s neck with an onion dip lid. For the most part, however, \u201cCaged\u201d follows a predictable pattern. There are those who are not under Christine\u2019s sway (Big Jim. Julia, Joe, and Norrie) and there\u2019s the Kinship, and the tension between the two is mounting. Even Norrie\u2019s infrequently appearing mother Carolyn (Aisha Hinds) has fallen under the sway of the new Chester\u2019s Mill hive mind (complete with eerie group whistling). She finds the X-ray machine that reveals Hunter will be permanently paralyzed as a result of his fall from the roof and thus become a drain on the community medicine. He\u2019s gotta go (and at this point, I think most of us would have been fine with that), but Julia, Joe, and Norrie rescue him from lethal injection at the last minute.\nThere\u2019s still plenty that doesn\u2019t work, starting with the Julia/Barbie/Eva triangle. The deck has been stacked here since the beginning, both because Barbie and Julia have a longer shared history (from our perspective, anyway) and because Eva is, you know, an evil alien or something. (I imagine if Barbie knew about Eva\u2019s suggestion that both women could be with him if only Julia would join the Kinship, it would complicate matters for him.) Junior\u2019s reversion to villainous creep isn\u2019t so effective, mainly because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve already thought of him for most of the show\u2019s run. And Uncle Sam remains a dreadful character with no real purpose; he\u2019s way overdue to make a huge sacrifice for the town and be off the show for good.\nFrank Whaley was an amusingly cartoonish addition for one of Under The Dome\u2019s patented three-episode guest arcs, but Aktaion\u2019s interest in the egg as an energy source always felt like a retcon that had been shoehorned into the increasingly sprawling dome mythology (ditto the revelation that it was Christine\u2019s initial discovery of the egg that caused the dome to appear). Their presence inside the dome was never adequately explained (Did they come in via the root cellar in Dale\u2019s father\u2019s back yard?) and now it appears their part of the story is over anyway. Even a version of this show that makes slightly more sense still can\u2019t help leaving loose ends and red herrings at every turn.\nI wonder if an actor like Aisha Hinds, who is only around for a handful of episodes each season, has any idea what\u2019s going on when she gets the script for her next appearance. It\u2019s probably confusing enough for the regulars, but if you\u2019ve been away a few weeks and then find out your character is now a drone in an alien-controlled collective\u2026I guess you just go with the flow.\nThe episode ends with the biggest cliffh"}

First, he visited an elementary school to talk about his No Child Left Behind (search) program, a program which has generate a fair amount of criticism from Democrats. Then the president headed off to a political fund-raiser.\nSo, who&apos;s right in this dispute over the president&apos;s education plan?

Chester Finn, who has been an education policy adviser to political figures from Ronald Reagan to the late Democratic Senator Pat Moynihan, who is currently president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation (search), joins us from our studios in New York.\nCHESTER FINN, PRESIDENT, THOMAS B. FORDHAM FOUNDATION: Yes, sir.\nHUME: What about this dispute? Some of those Democrats, a number of them, voted for program and now say it is under funded. What about that?\nFINN: Well, that dispute is as old as politics, at least as old as I can remember. It is election year and Democrats always say there is not enough money being spent on education. And Republicans usually say we&apos;re not getting our money&apos;s worth for the money we&apos;re currently spending.\nThe interesting change this year is that, for the first time in my memory, the Republicans are looking pretty good on education. George W. Bush looks like a serious education reformer and that&apos;s because he is one. And the Democrats are playing catch-up politically on this.\nThis was, however, bipartisan legislation two years ago. It wouldn&apos;t be shaped the way it is shaped if it weren&apos;t for Ted Kennedy (search) joining forces with George Bush to pass this piece of legislation, which incidentally, is 1100 pages long and has lot of moving parts.\nHUME: Yes. I remember when the bill passed, though; there were education reform advocate, perhaps including yourself, who there wasn&apos;t enough testing and enough accountability in it. What about that?\nFINN: There&apos;s lots of testing and accountability if the states and districts actually do what they&apos;ve been told to do here. The point, of course, is to just use the testing to find out where the changes need to be made, which states, which districts, which schools actually need to change and do things differently.\nAnd the real grumbling across the education land is the grumbling of people who don&apos;t want to change what they have been doing the last 20 years, even though it has been failing. Money is sort of a red herring in this issue. The real question is ... are people going to change how they teach and what they teach and whom they teach in order that lots more kids learn like those kids in the school in St. Louis in your segment?\nHUME: Now, tell me about how they compare, for example, and how they would come out in the testing to the schools, which people like you suggest are falling down on the job?\nFINN: Such as a lot more school of choice and a lot more flexibility for the states. Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller said no to those changes. And so what got left was mostly testing and accountability. And that was a bipartisan agreement. Testing is not expensive.

Do you offer extended Maternity/Paternity Leave, and are your Human Resources policies inclusive for Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, etc. individuals? Do you have prayer rooms facing the correct direction; do your gyms have areas that are exclusive for women? How is your pay equity based on gender? These are things that can help attract top talent and show you will welcome them as equal employees without singling them out, or making them feel that they won\u2019t find a sense of belonging at your company.\nIn addition to finding the right candidates, diversity brings several important things to your organization. Imagine if the people who applied for your job postings came in for an interview and didn\u2019t see anyone who looked like them, or if all the people who interviewed them asked the same questions in the same way. They would likely not be very interested in continuing the discussion. Your employer brand is only as good as what employees and candidates will say about you when you\u2019re not in the room. Taking the opportunity to show you are a progressive company that is investing visibly in many areas of diversity will be obvious from their first encounter with you.\nWhile it is generally true that almost everyone values diversity, you may have noticed that many in younger generations are very vocal about their values. Moreover, many of them expect diversity and can be very outspoken about how much it matters to them in a workplace. By bringing in a diverse group of people to your organization, you will have access to broader networks which will spur further diversity opportunities and all the benefits it brings. Think of how much more likely it is that diverse"}

During a long discussion of the matter, most board members were very supportive of the airport's efforts to attract new carriers to the airport -- including practices that sometimes took them on faraway, expensive trips.\nThe most outspoken board member, however, was Bernice Washington, who said the lack of actual abuse was secondary to the fact that the public believed the television reports are true.\n\"The people are [expletive] -- fair or not,\" Washington said.\nAs a result, she asked questions about Fegan's salary, executive pay structure, employee car allowances and other issues raised by the Channel 11 story.

It was the first time Uruguay won its opening match at the tournament since 1970, when it went on to reach the semifinals. Russia leads Group A on goal difference after beating Saudi Arabia 5-0 on Thursday in the tournament\u2019s first match. Uruguay, which also has three points, is now second. Egypt forward Mohamed Salah was on the bench for his country\u2019s first World Cup match since 1990 after injuring a shoulder while playing for Liverpool in last month\u2019s Champions League final.

Suarez failed to beat Egypt goalkeeper Mohamed El Shennawy in two one-on-one situations and Cavani hit the post from a free kick two minutes from the end.

{"idx": "24594", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner has warned that delays in extending the U.S. debt ceiling may cause irreparable harm.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner has warned that delays in extending the U.S. debt ceiling may cause irreparable harm. While borrowing costs for the U.S. government have not yet risen, irreparable harm may have already been done to the U.S. dollar and its status as a reserve currency. Ironically, it\u2019s not a plunging, but a rallying bond market that is a symptom of the problem. Let us explain.\nFirst, no one really knows how the markets will behave should the U.S. delay servicing its debt. Most observers believe that a) the Treasury has a big bag of tricks to continue servicing the debt; and b) politicians will play a game of chicken, but eventually do what they always do: agree to spend more money. Some have even suggested that a derailment of the bond market may not be the worst outcome, as it forces action on the deficit now rather than later, arguing that in the long-run, this would be a positive development. That said, we don\u2019t know how the bond market will react; but we do know that policy makers are playing with fire, and when you play with fire, you may get burned.\nFor the time being, this is mostly an oddity. But this may well have profound long-term implications for investors from domestic institutions to foreign central banks.\nIn the U.S., managers of money market funds and other vehicles that provide investors a high degree of liquidity, rely on the U.S. Treasury market. Regulations and practicalities make Treasuries the instrument of choice for a great number of cash management transactions. If there is a shortage of Treasuries, riskier and less liquid securities must be considered, creating operational and regulatory complexities. Few tears may be shed for the managers that have additional work, but some money market funds, amongst others, may become riskier to investors because of the wrangling in Congress.\nOur main concern, however, is with foreign central banks. A key reason why the U.S. dollar has been the world\u2019s reserve currency is because of the lack of alternatives. And when we talk about a lack of alternatives, we don\u2019t talk quality, but liquidity. When you have billions to deploy, but don\u2019t want to rock the markets, the U.S. Treasury markets have historically been the most liquid in the world. The People\u2019s Bank of China, for example, has been increasing its gold holdings; however, as a percentage of its reserves, gold holdings have been going down as total reserves have been climbing at an even faster pace. Liquidity concerns may be the main driver behind this, as the gold market is far less liquid than the Treasury markets. Like most central banks, the People\u2019s Bank of China typically does not try to influence market prices, thus adjusting any involvement based on liquidity considerations.\nIt\u2019s not just the gold market, though. As far as money markets are concerned, the U.S. has the deepest, most liquid market in the world. Indeed, one of the best ways to increase global stability would be for Asian countries to develop their domestic fixed income markets, so that Asian issues of debt are less dependent on the U.S. dollar. But even the Eurozone with an active market in German and French Treasuries, to name a few, is a distant second to the U.S.\nWe are not predicting that institutional investors will abandon the Treasury markets in the near future, but the damage created by a failure to raise the"}

{"idx": "24605", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The outcome of the by-poll for NA-120, a seat vacated due to the disqualification of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, sprang up a few surprises including an unexpected 14 percent vote by two debutant religious-political organisations, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLY) and the Milli Muslim League (MML), Jamaat-ud-Dawa\u2019s (JuD) political front.\nThe TLY got 7,130 ballots and the MML received 5,822 votes, ending up as distant third and fourth respectively in the by-poll. At the same time, the abysmal performance by two mainstream political parties, the secular-liberal PPP pocketing 1, 414 votes and the pan-Islamist JI bagging a meagre 592 votes, was equally shocking.\nWith less than one year left to the parliamentary elections in Pakistan, such electoral trends have raised a lot of interest among political pundits. Against this backdrop, it is important to deconstruct the impressive performance of the two new religious-political parties and how this could affect democracy in Pakistan.\nHistorically, religious-political parties have done poorly in Pakistan\u2019s electoral politics. They have never been voted to power at the national level. At best, they have formed coalition-governments, as junior partners, at the provincial level. At worst, they have remained political-pressure groups (for the better part of their political career) using their street power to protect their religious interests.\nWhile the PTI has eroded the PPP\u2019s power base in Punjab, the votes that the TLY and MML have attained in Punjab constitute the right-wing vote bank that usually had a pro- PML-N tilt. However, due to a number of factors, this vote-bank has now been split, shrinking the PML-N\u2019s power base in Punjab.\nFirst, in 2016, the PML-N fell out of favour with the Sunni-Barelvis, a sub-sect of the Hanafi school of thought, following the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri, the self-righteous assassin of the late governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, over the latter\u2019s efforts at reforms in the strict anti-blasphemy law. The top leadership of the Barelvis in Pakistan praises and hails Qadri as a hero. The PML-N\u2019s decision to implement the court\u2019s order of hanging Qadri alienated the party\u2019s right-wing voters. The Barelvis hold Nawaz Sharif responsible for Qadri\u2019s execution. The TLY was born out of the Movement to Free Mumtaz Qadri, which changed and entered politics after his execution.\nThe second is the changing character of the PML-N\u2019s politics from centre-right to centre-left. Since the 1980s, the PML-N has done right-wing politics in Pakistan and for the most part of the last four decades, an overwhelming majority of the Barelvis has voted for the party in return for protecting their religious interests. However, Qadri\u2019s execution eroded the trust between the PML-N and the Barelvis, rupturing the voting arrangements between the two.\nFurther, it created a distinct political consciousness among the Barelvis along sharp sectarian lines. They felt the need to enter politics to safeguard their religious interests. Hence, the erstwhile apol"}

The discounts are worth \u20ac500 for private cars and \u20ac1,000 for commercial vehicles, annually.\nRecent figures show a surge in the number of electric vehicle sales with 811 purchased in January this year compared with 104 for the same month in 2018. Plug-in hybrid car sales rose from 109 in January last year to 301 this year.\nMr Ross said more than 4,000 people, some 52 per cent of electric or hybrid car owners, had successfully signed up for the scheme.\nBut Fine Gael TD Noel Rock expressed shock that \u201conly one in every two of them has registered for a scheme that is meant to incentivise the public at large to convert to electric vehicles, turn doubters into believers and get more people buying electric vehicles\u201d.\nThe fact that only half of existing owners had applied for the scheme showed a clear issue with the \u201cclarity, consistency, effectiveness and usefulness of the scheme\u201d, he said.\nBut Mr Ross said \u201cif 48 per cent of people who qualify are not applying, it could be inertia\u201d. He said it could also be a matter of the scheme not being properly advertised, and he would bring the matter to TII\u2019s attention.\nMr Rock raised the issue following a report in The Irish Times that owners who had signed up for the scheme, which requires a toll tag, had been charged full price.\nHe said some operators applied the discount the moment a car passes through the toll, while others rebate the money on a monthly basis in arrears, but there was a \u201ccomplete lack of clarity and consistency\u201d on the issue.\nThe Dublin North-West TD drives an electric car himself and successfully receives the toll discount.\nMr Ross said neither the TII nor individual toll service providers had received \u201cinformation, concerns or complaints\u201d from customers about the scheme.\nHowever, while toll providers get information about cars from the national vehicle registration office, it has been suggested vehicle registration documentation should carry an extra category indicating whether a specific vehicle is petrol, diesel, electric or hybrid.

Some may see it as Sisyphus-like obsession, constantly attempting to bring something new and fresh to a series that has been reinvented multiple times over the course of five decades. In principle, however, the X-men embody themes that require a certain level of revitalization. It doesn't just keep the stories fresh. It ties their struggles to contemporary issues.\nThe X-men can't operate like they did in 1963 while remaining culturally relevant in 2018. Issues surrounding the struggle of marginalized minorities are still as pressing as they were when the original five X-men debuted, but the circumstances constantly change with every passing era. The era that Cullen Bunn finished during his run on Uncanny X-men in 2017 centers around survival in a world where mutants aren't just hated and feared, they're pushed aside and willingly erased from the culture.\nWhether it was due to narrative shifts or conflicts surrounding the movie rights, the biggest challenge for the X-men in recent years has been reestablishing their relevance in the greater Marvel universe. In the pages of X-men Red, X-men Gold, and X-men Blue, they make progress while enduring setbacks. The return of Uncanny X-men #1 promises to take a bold leap that requires every current X-men team to unite. Matthew Rosenberg, Ed Brisson, and Kelly Thompson join forces with R.B. Silva, Mahmud Asrar, and Yildiray Cinar to create an all-star creative cast to put mutants into an all-or-nothing scenario that feels familiar, but throws in some intriguing twists.\nThere are elements from classic X-men stories like Chris Claremont's Days of Future Past [YEAR] and Joss Whdeon's Gifted [YEAR] but the similarities never go beyond the surface features. Once the action starts and fastball specials start flying, Uncanny X-men #1 quickly becomes its own things. There are a lot of moving parts to the story. There are mysteries that take the X-men from the Kalahari Desert to Morrisville, North Carolina. Initially, there's not a lot of connective tissue between these sub-plots, but that changes once planes start crashing and people start randomly teleporting away.\nThe underlying catalyst for this chaos eventually converges around the idea of a vaccine being created for mutants. It's not framed as a cure, however. It's not even presented in the context of anti-mutant bigotry. The man promoting this vaccine, Senator Ashton Allen, says that mutants are \"innocent victims\" in need of \"treatment\". He's not Graydon Creed or Reverend William Stryker promoting mutant extermination. He presents this effort as an attempt to prevent mutant children from becoming dangers to themselves or others.\nThis kind of rhetoric isn't the same blind hatred that the X-men have been dealing with since the Kennedy Administration. It doesn't even qualify as hatred, on some levels. Senator Allen isn't demanding that mutants submit themselves for registration or surrender their civil liberties. He doesn't even call anyone a \"mutie\" or a \"freak\". He's just promoting something that he believes will alleviate suffering. For the X"}

Trying to pull any of these moves against a police officer will likely get you tased or shot, and almost certainly arrested.\nThe video is technically a part of the Gracie brothers' \"GracieBreakdown\" series, in which the two show how BJJ could be applied to a recent event, usually a mixed martial arts fight.\nAs for United Airlines, well, the video is just another flag in a long, painful line of reminders that treating your customers horribly and failing to apologize will cause a lot of PR problems.\nWATCH: Not again.

This is especially true of the \"local flora and fauna\" sort of museum dioramas. I have seen squirrels, thanks. But the Panorama is something else, a work that transcends its genre to become true art and a temple to Maker creativity.\nThe Panorama is the work of Lewis Lindsay Dyche, a 19-century KU professor. Dyche originally constructed the exhibit for the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. It featured 121 animals and took two years to complete. Scientific American called the Panorama one of the most remarkable exhibits at the Fair. By all accounts, Dyche was a very good taxidermist. But his taxidermy work is only part of what makes the Panorama so impressive.\nInstead of presenting a single scene, the Panorama flows, capturing every North American biome from the Arctic to the jungle. It wraps around the room, almost a full 360 degrees. As you follow the circle, polar bears and seals fade seamlessly into bunnies on the tundra, then aspen forests full of bobcats, and on into craggy cliffs dotted with mountain goats. As a child, it was my first brush with the realization that where I lived was only one part of something bigger\u2014if I walked far enough north, I'd find icy wastes, far enough south and there'd be vine-covered trees filled with monkeys. What the Panorama offered was perspective.

You're missing the desert and jungle areas.

It forms part of an ongoing negotiation with the British Olympic Association, which will inherit the rights from Locog.\n\"I am concerned to hear that businesses such as Wilkinson Eyre, who have designed the stunning Basketball Arena, are finding themselves unable to put themselves forward for awards ceremonies to promote that good work,\" said Jowell.\n\"This kind of stricture was never the intention when the rules were designed. I hope that a reasonable compromise can be found so that these great British architects can get the recognition that they deserve.\"\nRespondents to Armitt's study, which concluded that the next 12 to 18 months were a \"crucial window of opportunity\" for companies to publicise their association with the Games, were critical of the extent to which they could do so at the moment.\nOne said: \"To get any real commercial benefit, companies need to be allowed to demonstrate that they have, and are indeed working, on the London 2012 Games and this is virtually impossible in any real sense at the moment.\"\nAnother said that although their reputation had benefited \"this has not been a major enhancement due to the restrictions on promoting our involvement with the construction of the 2012 facilities.\"\nIndustry magazine Building has been running a campaign to highlight complaints from firms that the marketing protocol has gagged them as they seek to capitalise on their Olympic achievements.\nJowell paid tribute to the contribution of British businesses to the completion of the Olympic venues.\n\"The story of the Olympic construction is a success story for British business.

{"idx": "24626", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In March, comparing the price of a cancer drug on a per capita basis here and in India, I told drug companies how to charge $1.6 million per patient for a new drug -- and get away with it. So long as companies make sure that all patients have access, I argued, it's possible to convince governments and insurers to pay truly princely sums for medicines that really help patients.\nStill, I thought that $1.6 million, was a sky high, off-the-charts, unbelievable amount. Surely, no medicine for sale today cost more than $1 million I thought. In fact, the priciest one I can name is Soliris, from biotech high-flyer Alexion, which costs $500,000 per patient -- a lot, but still only half a million. Turns out I was wrong -- it's possible that medicines that are already on the market could rise to this price point, if they continue to help young patients grow bigger.\nI was convinced of this by an April 17 note from biotechnology analyst Geoffrey Porges of Sanford C. Bernstein. He wrote that ultra-high-priced drugs are the one \"bright spot\" in the pharmaceutical business. Companies will be able to maintain their prices for these expensive medicines, he argued, calling Alexion \"the paradigm of the postmillennial biopharmaceutical company.\" A second medicine Alexion is testing could also cost more than $200,000 a year. Biogen Idec could price its new drug for amyloid lateral sclerosis at more than $75,000 per patient per year. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' new cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco costs $290,000 price point, and a new Vertex CF combo pill could cost about as much.\nIn the process of making this argument, Porges took a look at how existing enzyme replacement drugs for rare genetic diseases are priced. These medicines, including medicines such as Cerezyme and Fabrazyme sold by Sanofi's Genzyme unit, all average $200,000 per patient per year or more. But they are actually dosed by weight and the cost of the medicine increases as patients gain weight. Because these medicines improve and extend the lives of children with terrible diseases, someday the per patient cost could become much higher as the kids grow up.\nThat red line is Naglazyme, which treats Maroteaux\u2013Lamy syndrome, a disease that causes dwarfism, heart problems, and nerve problems. The treatment, sold by BioMarin, costs about $350,000 for the average patient. For kids under five, as the chart shows, the cost would actually be well less than that. But what happens as those children get older?\nAs you can see, at current pricing, the cost of Naglazyme will pass $1 million as patients hit their teen years, and reach $1.3 million as they approach their 40s. Of course, it's not certain that this will happen; one could imagine that the price may need to drop over the coming decades. But this shows how very expensive these drugs are. Update: to be clear, only some patients will pay this per patient per year cost; the average cost could still be lower than that of, say, Soliris, because some of the patients on Naglazyme will be kids.\nOne of the most important questions when we think about how new medicines should be priced is this: is it better for a"}

And it\u2019s not just emotionally driven. Partnering with the next \u201cit\u201d product is an extremely effective and pragmatic marketing strategy. Brands can generate excitement amongst existing customers while simultaneously extending awareness of their brand to the partner\u2019s customers. Some common \u201cit\u201d partner categories over which brands compete include blockbuster movie releases, the latest electronic devices and hot new social media players.\nOver the last few months, there\u2019s been growing interest in a new \u201cit\u201d category: cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin has emerged as the Xerox or Kleenex of the category, with newer names such as Ethereum, Ripple and many others gaining notoriety. The digital currency checks several of the \u201cit\u201d criteria boxes: it\u2019s new, garners a lot of press, gets everybody talking, and provides status for those who own it. People who don\u2019t even know what cryptocurrency is\u2014or more specifically, those who don\u2019t fully understand it\u2014still want to own it for the sole purpose of saying they have it. They want to be seen as an early adopter, part of the \u201cit\u201d crowd.\nDespite delivering on a number of positive \u201cit\u201d criteria, marketers should proceed with caution before hitching their wagon to this global phenomenon. As with anything truly new, a partnership can be a gamble, and this new category is far from a traditional corporate product launch.\nWhile the benefits may ultimately outweigh the risks, it\u2019s important to understand the potential downside of partnering with cryptocurrencies.\nHistorically, currency is the most popular prize, reward and premium. It rises to the top of almost every focus group or survey response. Cash is king because everyone uses it; everyone accepts it as payment. Cryptocurrency is in many ways a modern, sexier version of cash. It may be even more appealing than cash to a progressive, image-conscious brand.\nHowever, cryptocurrency falls way short of cash when it comes to universal appeal to consumers or acceptance by retailers. In a recent poll by LendEDU, awareness of Bitcoin is strong, with 78.6 percent of Americans responding that they have heard of it, while awareness for Ethereum (31.6 percent) and Ripple (22.2 percent) is considerably less.\nIf a brand is running an incentive-based program with cryptocurrency and bad news breaks, that brand's program suddenly becomes toxic.\nOf course, awareness doesn\u2019t always translate to adoption. Less than 15 percent of Americans responded that they currently own or have owned Bitcoin. And retailers have been even more reluctant to jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. According to Morgan Stanley, only 0.6 percent of the top 500 online retailers accept Bitcoin, which actually represents a decline from 1 percent in 2016.\nWhy are these stats important? Because consumer participation in marketing programs that offer niche prizes and rewards is typically much lower.\nSome loyalty providers have started offering cryptocurrency as a reward option, which, in theory, is strategically sound. It\u2019s a digital reward that eliminates the expense of warehousing and fulfillment costs. It\u2019s appealing to international loyalty programs because it\u2019s a global currency. But despite those positives, it carries substantial risk as a reward item.\nThis extremely volatile currency can see exponential price fluctuations in a relatively short period of time, which could be"}

No one warned me that I was actually travelling there in a time machine, back to an age when girls were girls and men were men. It soon became obvious.\nWhat I learned in the few years I worked in the nation's capital was that power and privilege allow for the most boorish behaviour imaginable. And before anyone suggests that I'm talking about the olden days, gather round and I'll tell you stories that seem all too familiar today.\nSeasoned veterans of the Parliamentary Press Gallery had advised me not to rely too much on Question Period or news conferences but to get out into the bump and grind of the Ottawa social circuit and make connections. I was chuffed when a senior member of prime minister Brian Mulroney's inner cabinet circle, a popular senator, invited me to a \"5 to 7\" reception at his Ottawa pied-\u00e0-terre (I'm not naming him because he's deceased and unable to respond to this story).\nI don't recall the purpose of the gathering, but the senator's townhouse was abuzz with Ottawa insiders, a target-rich environment for journalists, and there were several of us there. As the party wound down and the crowd thinned, two other reporters and I agreed to share a cab home. The senator came to the door to say goodbye. He shook hands with the men, then turned to me. Suddenly, he had me pushed up against the wall while he groped and tried to force his tongue into my mouth. My colleagues stood by, aware of what was happening but not knowing what to do. I fought the senator off, grabbed my coat and fled the house, dishevelled and confused.\nThe two men with me in the taxi said they were shocked by what they had just witnessed. I don't recall their names but I do recall what they said: They cautioned me to be careful what I did about it.\n\"I hope you're not planning to report him,\" one of them warned. \"Just remember what happened to Judy Morrison.\"\nThat was enough to send a chill down my spine.\nJudy was the highly accomplished host of the weekly CBC radio program The House. About a year before I arrived in Ottawa, she became the object of scorn and ridicule when she dared to expose the appalling behaviour of the prime minister's press secretary, Michel Gratton. If you wanted an interview with Mr. Mulroney, you had to go through Mr. Gratton, and Judy had made several requests. He told her finally that she could have a one-on-one only if she agreed to go out on \"a date.\" A reporter from the Ottawa Sun heard about Mr. Gratton's offer, confirmed it with Judy and reported it in the newspaper.\nNDP MP Margaret Mitchell rose in the House of Commons a few days later to demand an explanation from the Conservatives. But instead of contrition, the House erupted into uproarious laughter, a rare moment of shared mirth among political foes.

{"idx": "24636", "prompt": "Continue the following text: China has been transformed by a credit-fueled investment boom unlike anything the world has ever seen.\nA credit-based economy, built around what has effectively been the dollar standard, made it all possible. There\u2019s no limit to the amount of credit that can be created under a fiat money system. And the dollar standard created a very large global boom, as U.S. dollars flooded into countries like China.\nBetween 1990 and 2014, investment in China increased a staggering 50-fold. Between 2007 and 2014 alone, investment in China increased by 236%. In the U.S. meanwhile, investment only increased 6% over that same time period.\nThe Chinese are therefore dependent on the dollar standard. If they could have given it up, they would have. But they can\u2019t. They desperately need a trade surplus with the U.S. and the rest of the world to finance their economy and sustain their jobs. Jobs are the main benefit they receive from the dollar standard. China\u2019s had an explosion in their population in the last three to four decades. Because of the dollar standard, globalization and the growing U.S. trade deficit with China, they\u2019ve been able to keep those people employed, fed, and increasingly prosperous.\nChina kept the global bubble inflated after the U.S. bubble burst in 2008, through very rapid credit growth and investment growth. But that credit-fueled came into an end sometime in 2014 or 2015. And China faces severe problems as a result. I\u2019m not at all certain China\u2019s economy grew at all last year.\nChinese exports used to grow up to 30% a year. Now they\u2019re contracting. Last year, for example, Chinese imports contracted 17%. The great export surge from 1990-2014 will not be repeated.\nThere\u2019s simply not enough demand in the entire world to permit China\u2019s investment-driven economy to grow. The global economy now teeters on recession, if not outright depression. In the past, China was able to export most of its excess production to other countries. But now trade is collapsing and global demand is much too weak to absorb further Chinese exports. Meanwhile, U.S. credit growth is too weak to drive growth, at home or abroad. And my projections don\u2019t show those figures changing anytime soon. The bottom line is that China will not be able to sustain its economy through export-led growth.\nChina\u2019s investment boom has long since outpaced demand. And with exports contracting, that is now resulting in heavy losses in the banking system. Investment is a net good, but only as long as it creates goods that can be sold for more than they cost to make. When investment is too high relative to demand, prices fall and investment results in losses, rather than profits. That\u2019s what China is facing.\nChina realizes it can\u2019t continue having such massive levels of investment. That investment has already resulted in far too much excess production capacity. Most of it is already generating losses. And the more they invest now, the more wealth they destroy. Further investment in loss-generating enterprises will only result in more losses. But without continued high rates of investment, the Chinese economy will fall into severe recession. That\u2019s the trap.\nChina invests much more than it consumes, which has led to a severely imbalanced economy. And Chinese per capita income is far too low to consume the nation\u2019s excess capacity. Median Chinese disposable income, for example, is only $8"}

The one with the first grade teacher from The Success Academy, erupting at her tiny peanut of a student who had demonstrated the wrong procedures to solve a math problem.\nWhen I watched it and then read the accompanying piece this morning, I must admit I got sick to my stomach. So many thoughts swirled through my head; so many questions. But there was one issue I just can't let go.\nThe most important thing--perhaps overlooked in the article--is that the conversation is about the individual and not on the larger issue. The video--which blurs the student faces for anonymity but clearly identifies the teacher--is personal, and not something that transfers as clearly to the issue at hand. This is a tiny snapshot of something much larger, a small slice of a bigger and more complex problem.\nSo let's stop talking about the teacher's actions, poor choices, and bad pedagogy.\nThe real conversation that we must have is about the education of our children of color. The relationships we have as teachers with our students. The role of race and poverty in education. And the type of schools that many of our students attend.\nWe need to have a conversation about the larger scale issues, not just about the individual. I can't help but wonder what blurring out the teacher's face on the video could have done to help spur this. Could this have made the issue about systemic issues, instead of one teacher's bad behavior?\nSo here's my call to action: Instead of focusing on one educator's horrible pedagogical moves, let's stop shaming her. Put the shame spotlight on the larger system. Use this as fodder to have a deeper and more important conversation. One about the role of race in our education system. Let's talk about how our children of color are treated in some of our schools and what we can do as a collective body to make sure things start to change.\nIn the words of Nikki Giovanni, \"If now isn't a good time for the the truth, I don't know when we'll get to it.\""}

Chris Sununu vetoed a death penalty repeal bill last June, and the Senate lacked the votes to override it in September. But momentum grew after Democrats won control of both the House and Senate in November, and an identical bill has passed both chambers with more than the necessary two-thirds majority needed to override Sununu's planned veto. The House vote 279-88 last month, while the Senate vote Thursday was 17-6, with five Republicans joining 12 Democrats voting in favor of repeal.\n\"State-sanctioned killing is cruel, ineffective and inherently flawed,\" said Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover. \"It is time to abolish the death penalty in New Hampshire.

Twenty states have abolished or overturned it.\nNew Hampshire hasn't executed anyone since 1939. The repeal bill would not apply retroactively to Michael Addison, who killed Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in 2006 and is the state's only death row inmate. But supporters of capital punishment argue that courts will see it differently.\n\"The day that this passes and is signed into law, Mr. Addison's sentence will be converted to life in prison,\" said Sen.

She will not be able to speak to her husband again, whereas Mr. Addison will be able to talk to his family and have them come up to visit him.\"\nLaura Briggs has largely stayed out of the debate over the death penalty bill over the years, but she spoke last month against a repeal in part because her son's now working in law enforcement.\n\"The death penalty is about protecting society from evil. It's not about an eye-for-an-eye or revenge. It's about protecting our society from evil people that do evil things,\" she said at the time.\nCarson echoed those comments Thursday.\n\"We're not talking about getting revenge or soothing the families soul or anything else like that,\" she said. \"This is about justice nothing more, nothing less.\"\nOther relatives of murder victims, however, testified in favor of the bill, as did retired prosecutors, clergy and former death row inmates who were exonerated and released.

So this is actually my very first game project, my first interactive project. It took me a long time to get here because of that.\nI had an iPod Touch about 4 or 5 years ago. I had it for about three hours, and just intuitively, not really knowing the technology on a real level, felt that things were getting close enough that you could start opening up this whole new canvas for storytelling, which was the actual world.

And make no mistake, it will get loud.\nThere are a myriad of concerns facing music event organizers, from assembling a compelling schedule of talent, to ensuring the proper beer-vendor-to-portable-toilet ratio, and, finally, to supplying enough pimento loaf to satisfy Broken Social Scene\u2019s backstage deli-tray needs. Near the top of any to-do list is the complicated matter of amplified sound. Getting the music toward the ears of the people who want to hear it is not a problem \u2013 that issue was solved at Yasgur\u2019s Farm in 1969. Rather, the challenge is to make sure the noise isn\u2019t drifting to residents living near festival sites. If you think Arcade Fire is thunderous, nobody makes a racket like a music-averse NIMBY.\nWorking to solve sound-bleed issues is Jeremy Bridge and his Calgary-based company PK Sound. Bridge and his team have developed a speaker system called Trinity, which uses software and robotics to funnel the sound precisely where it needs to go.\nFactors affecting sound travel include wind, rain, temperature, even the cloud ceiling. All those conditions can be dealt with swiftly with a touch of a laptop key. Slats within the Trinity speakers are shifted to control sound direction.\nShambhala, an annual electronic music bash, is set on a cattle ranch in the West Kootenay mountains. Sound wafting to surrounding areas isn\u2019t a major concern there. But in urban places, with ever increasing population density, stemming the bleed is a high priority.\nIn 2017, drifting decibels at the Ever After Music Festival in Kitchener, Ont., resulted in some 130 noise complaints. This summer, organizers of the annual electronic dance music (EDM) event brought in Bridge and his PK Sound techs as consultants. The result? Just six nearby residents complained that their peace had been disturbed.\nAsked about the advanced PK Sound technology and know-how, Mattacchione puts it simply: \u201cWe like it, the talent likes it, the city officials like it and the residents like it. Trinity will be the system we\u2019ll use.\"\nEDM festivals are particularly prone to noise complaints. Thanks to its deep, resonant frequencies and because of its reputation for youthful (let\u2019s say) exuberance, the genre and its thumping, rowdy gatherings are less than palatable to older demographics. Because of that, Bridge and PK Sound have carved out a specialty, working on such EDM events as Ottawa\u2019s Escapade Music Festival and the gigantic Electric Daisy Carnivals in Las Vegas and Mexico City.\nAnd while the technology is especially valuable for use at outdoor venues, PK Sound systems see duty on arena tours as well. One satisfied client is country star Dierks Bentley. As for the future, Bridge sees growth in Asian and European markets. \u201cThese are exciting times for sure,\u201d he says.\nPeople are talking.

She declined to specify the type of cancer Safire had or say when he had been diagnosed.\nSafire spent more than 30 years writing on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. In his \"On Language\" column in The New York Times Magazine and 15 books, Safire traced the origins of words and everyday phrases such as \"straw-man,\" \"under the bus\" and \"the proof is in the pudding.\"\"\nSafire penned more than 3,000 op-ed columns, aggressively defending civil liberties and Israel while tangling with political figures. Bill Clinton famously wanted to punch the curmudgeonly columnist in the nose after Safire called his wife \"a congenital liar.\"\n\"Not only was he brilliant in language and assessing the nuances of politics, he was a kind and funny boss who gave lots of credit to others,\" Shields said.\nAnd as a speechwriter in the Nixon White House, Safire penned Vice-President Spiro Agnew's famous phrase, \"nattering nabobs of negativism,\" a tongue-in-cheek alliteration that Safire claimed was directed not at the press but Vietnam defeatists.\nSafire also wrote several novels and served as chairman of the Dana Foundation, a philanthropy that supports brain science, immunology and arts education.\nAlong with George Will and William F.

Defensive back Willie Creear completed the touchdown trifecta when Redwoods\u2019 snap to backup quarterback Sam Fisk sailed over his head and all the way back into the end zone, where Creear pounced on it for the score.\nThen, things got dicey. Redwoods drove and scored on Ronn Schruefer\u2019s 12-yard pass to Aubrey Reed, innocuously enough, to make it 33-7. But Brandon Noland fumbled the following kickoff and Ralph Marks picked it up at the 49, returning it for a touchdown, and Derick Seward lost the handle on Butte\u2019s very next possession. Though he appeared to be down well before the ball popped out, no whistles blew and Jeff Daceus was all too willing to take that fumble back for six as well.\nNeedless to say, the halftime break couldn\u2019t come sooner for Butte.\nStill, Butte had the answers in the second half, limiting the Corsairs to just three points the rest of the way as the Roadrunners rebuilt a four-score lead; it was the fourth time in as many games this year that Butte has gone over the 40-point threshold. Dennis was limited to 57 yards rushing and fumbled, an off-day for a back averaging well over 100 yards per game, but he reached the end zone twice, as did wideout Nick Lonnegren, who had touchdown catches of 37 and 15 yards from Ramirez, the state\u2019s top-ranked passer. Butte got backfield support from Seward, who had 52 yards, and Cameron Mikell, who added 46 yards on just six carries. Few Roadrunners expressed anything but"}

We recognize that we are in the midst of an historic endeavor, not only to defend our democracies from the threat to our freedoms posed by terrorism, but also to build a Europe that is truly whole and free.\nThe countries who banded together on the Baltic shores in August of 1989, in Visegrad in 1991 and in Vilnius in 2000 have played an important role in making what seemed a dream of our forefathers into a reality for our children. Our countries came together because we had drawn the lesson from our own past that we can better achieve our common aspirations if we cooperate with one another. We wanted the Vilnius Group to become an engine of regional cooperation and integration that would help overcome our continent's past divide and set a cornerstone for a Europe whole and free.\nSince 1989, we have learned that we will be called upon to teach far more often than we will be forced to fight. But we must be prepared to do both with a seriousness of purpose. We have learned that a common insecurity may have brought us together, but it will be a common vision of man that finally unites a democratic Europe. Thus, we set for ourselves the goal of acting in solidarity and as de facto allies \u2013 towards each other and towards those Western institutions that we aspire to join.\nWe have learned that the damage done in the 20th century to all the nations from the Baltic to the Black Sea by nationalism, fascism and communism was far more profound than we could have imagined. From the outset our goal has been to bring our countries back into the community of nations from which we were bitterly separated for nearly half a century. The reintegration of our democracies into the Euro-Atlantic community has required huge economic sacrifices, painstaking reform, and significant political risks. Nevertheless, the path we have chosen is clear. History requires but two things of Europe's new democracies: the acceleration of reform at home and a steadiness of resolve abroad.\nFive months from now the leaders of the Euro-Atlantic will gather in Prague and Copenhagen to make decisions that will shape our continent's future for decades to come. We are determined to ensure that each of our countries will be as prepared as possible to achieve its goals of integration into the European Union and membership in the NATO alliance. We believe that as many of our countries as have completed their preparations should be invited to join NATO in November and the European Union in December. But we have also committed at this summit to continue to support and assist one another beyond Prague and Copenhagen by further strengthening our democratic institutions and by pursuing a policy of continuous reform in our militaries and civil societies. We believe that Prague and Copenhagen will mark a new beginning for the process of reform and a further deepening of our commitment to the democratic transformation of our countries.\nWe continue to share the view we expressed at the Bucharest summit that stability and security in Europe can best be served by a balanced approach between regional cooperation in Northern Europe and the emerging \"southern dimension\" of Euro-Atlantic security. In our preparations for NATO membership, we have emphasized the role of regional partnerships and the essential character of close cooperation between Europe's north and Europe's south. We have discussed the ways in which we contribute to NATO operations and agreed on the urgent need to develop new capabilities in the Alliance, as set forth in"}
{"idx": "24674", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Are You Missing Out By Shopping A Retailer's Mobile Site Instead Of Desktop?\nLast year\u2019s holiday season was a hands-down winner for mobile shopping. Traffic and sales both hit all-time highs during Holiday 2017. In my own company\u2019s examination of retailers\u2019 eCommerce strategies (to be released August 25th), we found that 90% of surveyed retailers reported that more traffic now comes from mobile than from desktop.\nFor consumers, it\u2019s easy to think that because it\u2019s \u201cdigital\u201d they are getting the same experience on mobile that they\u2019re getting from the desktop site.\nAre they? The simple answer is no. But it\u2019s actually not that simple.\nMobile commerce in retail started out much like eCommerce did in general. In most retailers, a few people saw the importance of the channel as it began to emerge and insisted their company do something about it. As a result, the first mobile site efforts were separate from eCommerce (both because it was a bit experimental and to make it easy to kill). They offered much less capability than the desktop site, in part because some of the technologies that made desktop sites work just weren\u2019t supported by early mobile browsers.\nEven today, mobile is often treated as the neglected step-child. At RSR, we still find retailers who offer digital gift cards on their desktop site that are obviously a broken process on mobile. Even if retailers with that issue can\u2019t actually support the mobile purchase of digital gift cards (which they should be able to do), it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not even paying attention to what the experience looks like on mobile \u2013 better to just turn it off completely than to continue to offer something that errors out every time a shopper tries to use it. I wonder every time I evaluate retailers with this issue if anyone is paying attention to mobile at all \u2013 does no one notice they are getting 0% conversion rate on mobile digital gift card purchases?\nToday\u2019s mobile commerce is much more sophisticated than those early efforts. For a lot of retailers, responsive design is a priority, where a single website can be designed to offer an experience that works for desktop, tablet, mobile \u2013 whatever screen size you want. And most retailers\u2019 online strategies include a \u201cmobile first\u201d priority, where they design for the smallest, most challenging screen first and then scale up to richer experiences as the screen size grows. And while there is always a debate around whether to create unique mobile experiences that take advantage of unique mobile capabilities (like accessing the address book or camera, for example) vs. having one experience that works equally well across devices, the technology to support either decision is increasingly available \u2013 one code base, multiple unique experiences.\nIn other words, no matter the retailer\u2019s strategy for mobile, it\u2019s getting easier to implement it without resorting to multiple instances or code bases or support. There should be no excuse for having a sub-par mobile experience compared to desktop, other than a retailer is not making it a priority.\nWhich leads to a somewhat counter-intuitive answer to the question \u2013 yes, there can be substantial differences between a retailer\u2019s desktop and mobile experiences, but mobile may not always come out worse. And for shoppers who are annoyed by personalization or pop-ups, that \u201clesser\u201d mobile experience may actually be preferred. Here\u2019s a round-up of some recent data that RSR has collected.\nMobile is not always slower than desktop. In an evaluation we completed this year, we found that mobile can actually be faster than desktop, depending on how you measure it. We utilized webpagetest.org for gathering our performance data, and we found that desktop sites"}

With the next major version of the suite\u0097Office 10\u0097not due until early next year, SP2 will be the dominant version of the world's leading productivity software for a while.\nThe most newsworthy capability added by the service pack is support for a broader range of file formats, Open Document Formats (ODF, the open-standard document formats used by OpenOffice) and Adobe PDF in particular. It also allows users to uninstall service pack updates individually, using Microsoft Service Pack Uninstall Tool for the 2007 Microsoft Office Suite. PCMag.com got an early look at the service pack, though not at the uninstall tool.\nIt's been speculated in the tech press that the support for Adobe's page definition format finally being baked into Office was a result of a court ruling or agreement with Adobe, but since many other third-party products have long included the ability to save to PDF format, the move seems more a sign of Microsoft acknowledging the popularity of the competitor's format. Incidentally, the option for saving as PDF also offers to save the file in Microsoft's competing XPS format.\nA representative for Microsoft explained the move as follows: \"As far as including PDF, this is not a result of a court ruling or some other agreement. The decision to add PDF, and XPS, support to Office is consistent with our long held belief that customers should be able to choose the document format that best meets their needs in a given situation. This is why Microsoft has supported many formats in Office in the past and is including support for these additional formats in SP2.\"\nMicrosoft also claims improved performance with multiple graphics elements present, better printout quality, and as the Office Sustained Engineering blog notes, \"Improved interoperability using standard DrawingML markup to describe the visual properties of the SmartArt graphic and Substantial improvements to Forms-based authentication support in Word, Excel, PowerPoint and SPD.\" Those last won't affect most everyday users, but there are many fixes and app-specific updates that will be welcome productivity adds. Access gets the ability to export reports to Excel spreadsheets, Excel gets improved charting functionality, and Outlook and PowerPoint get improved performance.\nService Pack 2 updates all editions of Office from Basic to Ultimate, and all Office applications. This means not just the biggies\u0097Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint\u0097but also InfoPath, Publisher, OneNote, Groove, Access, SharePoint, Project, Visio, and InterConnect. It also updates shared ancillary programs such as Proofing Tools, Printing Assistant, and Viewers, plus updates for all languages.\nService Pack 2 includes more than 2,000 updates in all. For this reason, the update can take a while if you have a lot of apps that haven't been updated. The Microsoft team warned me that the update could take more than an hour to install, but on a 2GHz dual-core Athlon Vista machine with 2GB RAM, it only about 15 minutes. Of course, the update time depends on how many Office apps are installed on your system, how up-to-date they are, and the speed of the system itself.\nWhen I tried the new Saving to PDF feature, it worked without a hitch, and now the option for that and for OpenDocument Text format appear right in the main Save As choices in Word."}

(Perhaps you've heard of them?). So, Randy formed his own band, Bachman Turner Overdrive, and it didn't take long for BTO to make their mark. \"Takin' Care of Business\" was the band's biggest hit, but there were many more, including \"Let it Ride\" and \"You Ain't Seen Nothing yet\", all of which helped secure BTO's place in rock history. All told, they sold more than 20 million albums, worldwide.\nIn the late '70s, Randy went solo. After a couple of BTO reunions in the '80s, Randy left the group for good in 1991. Meanwhile, Fred kept making music with the other guys in BTO. Randy moved on to a number of new musical projects; more recently, he's been heard over the airwaves hosting his show 'Vinyl Tap' on CBC Radio.\nBut all the while, fans never stopped hoping for another Bachman/Turner collaboration... and in 2010, they finally made it happen. The guys performed at this year's Grey Cup, played some festival gigs, and for the first time in 20 years, they've got an album of all-new music."}

Ahmed Asiri pointed out in February that both Israel and Riyadh share concerns over Tehran. \u201cWe have the same enemy, the same threat,\u201d WSJ quoted. He also noted the U.S. is an ally of both Israel and Saudi Arabia as well.\nThe simple fact is, every Israeli prime minister since 1973 has presented some version of a final status deal to the Palestinian Authority, including several that included handing over most of Judea and Samaria. Each and every proposal was rejected by every leader of the Palestinian Authority, from Yasser Arafat to Mahmoud Abbas.\nAnd so it has continued to this day, with the PA government instead choosing to make incitement against Jews and Israel an active part of the social programming of its population from the cradle to the grave. The brainwashing of all citizens has taken priority at all levels to ensure the concept becomes part of the population\u2019s cultural heritage as fast and as thoroughly as possible.\nFor readers who wish to see examples of the Palestinian Authority-sponsored incitement and the programming translated by the Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) organization, click here.\nNow with U.S. President Donald Trump on his way to the region later this month \u2014 his first stop slated to be in Riyadh \u2014 it is possible the fragile bond between Israel and Saudi Arabia may grow even stronger.

Over 54% of physicians report a loss of enthusiasm for work, feelings of cynicism, and a low sense of personal accomplishment. The number is up 10% from just three years ago.\nWho is to blame? If you ask many physicians, the fault lies among leaders involved in healthcare finance, policy and clinical administration.\nWhy don\u2019t business people get us?\nWhy are there so many administrators involved in the delivery of care now\u2014when there were so few in the early days of my career?\nThis is the general sentiment I hear most frequently from physician colleagues. There is a real belief that everything would be better if my administrator colleagues just backed off and let them get back to taking care of patients.\nWe are amidst one of the most dynamic moments in healthcare delivery\u2014and the relationship between those who deliver care and those who administrate it has never been more tense, challenged, or fractured.\nThe simplistic explanation is that change is hard\u2014and the healthcare industry is changing more rapidly than anyone is able to keep up with. There is certainly some truth to this, but it misses a bigger\u2014not to mention potentially fixable\u2014problem. The relationship between those who administrate care and those who deliver care has never been more strained because at a very basic level, both groups don\u2019t understand or trust one another.\nSolving the challenges facing American healthcare will require a distinctly different type of relationship between physicians and administrators than currently exists in most health systems around the country.\nDrawing on my experience leading change at CareMore Health System, and through discussions with my physician and administrator colleagues, I\u2019ve come to believe that building a better relationship between physicians and administrators is a real possibility.\nFour guiding principles can help jump-start the effort.\nThe first is to formalize processes and structures to unlock the ingenuity and knowledge of front-line physicians. As health systems focus increasingly on maximizing value, physicians are dramatically underutilized assets. Systems build broad-based committees and coalitions, but the physicians sitting on these committees are almost always part-time administrators, and almost never true front-line clinicians. Even the best-intentioned clinician-administrators often lose sight of the micro-level insights that drive improvements in care or delivery. Sadly, I increasingly include myself in this category.\nOne of the fundamental cultural tenets at CareMore is that all physicians\u2014in addition to being responsible for delivering care\u2014are responsible for redesigning healthcare. This type of empowerment leads us to genuine insights that enable us to collectively improve care. A great example was the insight that providing free toenail clipping services to diabetic patients could improve the frequency of foot examinations, allow early intervention on ulcers and reduce amputation rates. Getting the culture of physician engagement right\u2014and valuing all physicians for the special insights that they can bring to care delivery\u2014 is a critical foundation for value-based healthcare delivery.\nThe second principle is to invest in educating physicians about the financing of care delivery. Most physicians complete their training with little or no knowledge about the financing or organization of healthcare. Nowhere in their premedical education, medical school, residency or fellowship do most physicians get a comprehensive education on healthcare policy, administration, finance or organizational behavior.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that there is a world of suspicion between those of us involved in administrating and financing care and those involved in actually delivering it. When you are working with different understandings of how the world is structured and why, mistrust, misunderstanding and miscommunication are soon"}

In the previous 36 months, the state had fined nursing homes a total $639,500, according to philly.com.\nIndustry officials have said that the state fines place another burden on operators already under financial strain to provide quality service.\nState officials say they are responding to Auditor General Eugene DePasquale\u2019s demand for improved oversight of the nursing care industry. His July audit identified three main issues -- inadequate review of nurse staffing levels, complaint handling and sanctions against poor-performing facilities.\nDePasquale discovered in his 22-month audit that the health department found federal deficiencies in nursing homes that led to $2 million in federal fines, but just $172,350 in state fines. He also found that the state ordered just 30 in-service trainings, the department\u2019s alternative to state fines.\nNursing home operators have been getting less Medicaid reimbursement to care for the elderly, Henry said. Nursing homes are losing an average of $27 a day on Medicaid clients. Some members of Leading Age which pay higher wages lose $100 a day.\nEven if the state House budget makes it though with a proposed increase in Medicaid reimbursement, it would remove millions for centers catering to a higher population of medical assistance residents.\nOperators have less money to provide quality care, and now are fined if they fail to provide quality care, Henry said.\nPreviously the health department worked closely with faltering nursing homes to bring them into compliance and helped a center direct resources to where they were needed, Henry said.

But he never got the chance.\nMr. Silva, who had come here as part of President Alan Garcia's delegation, said the 200,000 peasants that he represents received only a tiny fraction of the street price of cocaine and felt trapped in a violent world of narcotics traffickers, leftist guerrillas and the security forces.\nBut he said that transforming the rich Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru, perhaps the largest coca growing area in the world, would cost billions of dollars and that so far no one had been willing to provide the money. The United States, he said, seemed to prefer spending its money on law enforcement, which sometimes drove peasants into the arms of the guerrillas.\nAs President Bush and the leaders of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia began their summit meeting this morning, soldiers and the police had taken up positions along the main streets of Cartagena. A half-dozen Colombian warships and patrol boats maneuvered in the bay surrounding the peninsula where the talks were held and helicopters loaded with anti-terrorist teams clattered overhead.\nAs Colombian and American officials here had predicted, the summit meeting went off without even a hint of violence. The deployment of about 5,000 soldiers and police officers, however, had made some residents jittery. Schools and many businesses closed today, and traffic was unusually light.\nElsewhere in Colombia, however, students at several universities protested against Mr. Bush's presence, and in Cali, one of the main trafficking centers, guerrillas of the National Liberation Army kidnapped an American priest, the Rev. Francisco Amico Ferrari. The guerrillas said the kidnapping, like that of two other Americans earlier in the week, was intended to show their resentment toward the American President.\nLate this afternoon, the National Liberation Army declared that it now considered every ''American interest'' in Colombia to be ''a military target of our organization.'' Military analysts said that while the National Liberation Army, with an estimated strength of 2,000, had carried out a series of kidnappings recently in Bogota, Medellin and Cali, it was doubtful that the organization is capable of carrying out major attacks.\nA spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Colombia said she did not know anything about Mr. Silva's attempts to see Mr. Bush. She said she also had no information on an assertion by Mr. Silva that the American Embassy in Lima had denied him a visa to attend a special session of the United Nations on drugs next week in New York.\nSome United States officials in Washington speculated this week that President Garcia, who had threatened not to attend the summit meeting in protest against the United States invasion of Panama, might have invited Mr. Silva to the meeting in an effort to embarrass Mr. Bush.\nMr. Garcia has argued that the United States should be spending less on the police and military in the fight against cocaine and more on economic development. Mr. Bush has pledged more than $2.2 billion in aid to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia over the next four years, but the proportion designated for economic development is far lower than the amount Peru and Bolivia say is needed.\nMr. Silva said that while no other crop gave peasants more profit than coca, income from fruits and vegetables could be multiplied with the establishment of food processing plants."}

Back up regularly and thoroughly, so that you can quickly and easily recover from small problems such as user-errors (deleting a file) and big problems (system death or fire/theft).\nChange your important passwords! Again, telling people to change their important passwords on a regular basis seems remedial, but experience and feedback from readers tells me that it's a valid message. I also feel compelled to add the \"don't reuse passwords\" message too. Change your important passwords regularly (few times a year) and never reuse the same password for multiple accounts! In my experience the reason that people don't manage their passwords well comes down to one thing - not having decent password management software installed. And there really isn't any excuse for not having good password management software. If you're a Windows only person, I recommend the excellent PasswordSafe application (free product). If you want something that works cross platform then I recommend SplashID which has versions of its password manager for a variety of platforms (commercial product). Manage your passwords!\nClean the cobwebs out of your systems! One of the main causes of system failures is overheating, and one of the major causes of overheating is dust and detritus build-up on components and, critically, on fans. So open up your system periodically and use a can of compressed air to blow your system clean (this can be a messy job so you might want to do it outside). DON'T use a vacuum cleaner on your system because"}

The Aston Martin Vanquish Zagato wowed the crowd at the 2016 Concorso d\u2019Eleganza Villa d\u2019Este in Italy, but at the time Aston said it was just a concept. Yet thanks to customer prodding, the Zagato will now go into limited production, and it probably won\u2019t be cheap.\nAston says the production decision was made due to \u201cunprecedented customer interest,\u201d which doesn\u2019t seem like an exaggeration, given that it\u2019s only been about a month since the Vanquish Zagato was first shown at Villa d\u2019Este. Just 99 copies of the car will be made. Expect them to get snatched up quickly.\nItalian coachbuilder Zagato took the already-handsome Vanquish and added a bit more flair. The sleeker bodywork is rendered entirely in carbon fiber, with large panels that eliminate body cut lines. The traditional Aston grille is enlarged into a gaping maw, with two round driving lights. The glass wraps around the body not unlike the way it would in a Le Mans prototype race car. Zagato also threw in some of its signature styling elements, including a \u201cdouble bubble\u201d roof and round taillights, which use LED \u201cblades\u201d adapted from the Vulcan track car.\nThe collaboration between Aston Martin and Zagato dates back to 1960 and the DB4 GT Zagato, an iconic model that is now worth millions of dollars. Other Aston Martin Zagato cars include the 1986 V8 Vantage Zagato, 2002 DB7 Vantage Zagato, and the 2011 V12 Vantage Zagato.\nThe Vanquish Zagato uses the same 6.0-liter V12 as the standard Vanquish, but with output boosted from 568 horsepower to 592 hp. That likely makes this the most powerful production version of this engine yet. The naturally aspirated V12\u2019s days are numbered, as Aston is launching an all-new twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V12 in the DB11. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Aston says the Zagato will do 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.\nAston won\u2019t discuss pricing for the Vanquish Zagato, but it will probably cost much more than the standard Vanquish.

{"idx": "24707", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: THE recent strike by a group of bus drivers from China at public transport operator SMRT has polarised public opinion in Singapore.\nOn one side, civil society groups have framed the issue as one of human rights and morality. They have decried the uneven distribution of power between corporations and workers, the unfair wages paid to foreign workers, and the poor conditions they labour under.\nOn the other side, the Government has emphasised the illegality of the drivers' actions, the availability of legitimate channels for workers to voice their grievances, and the country's \"zero tolerance\" of acts which disrupt industrial harmony.\nWhat seems to be missing from the debate is an economist's perspective. There has not been a wider discussion of the economic rationale and implications of the Government's foreign worker policies.\nAnalysing Singapore's foreign worker policies through the lens of economics leads to some surprising conclusions which suggest that neither the position taken by the civil society groups nor the current government approach is viable on its own.\nA good place to begin our economic analysis is to ask whether foreign workers are properly priced. Foreign workers are prepared to work for lower wages than Singaporeans doing the same job. Allowing low-skilled foreign labour unfettered access to Singapore would therefore depress wages in those sectors that are more dependent on foreign labour.\nA tempting, but economically flawed solution, is to require employers to pay differential wages so that a Singaporean worker earns more than the foreigner doing the same job. But somewhat counter-intuitively, this does not serve the interests of Singaporeans. If Singaporeans are paid more than foreign workers who are equally productive, what incentive would employers have to hire the Singaporean worker?\nThe argument that Singaporeans should be paid more because they have more needs or face higher costs is also misguided. Wages should reflect the marginal productivity of the worker, not his needs. If wages are based on needs, workers would be justified in demanding a wage increase from their employer for having more children.\nIF IT is bad economics to (artificially) raise the wages of Singaporean workers relative to foreign workers, should we then impose additional costs of the latter so that they are more expensive to hire? Foreign workers impose \"external\" costs on society. These costs include increased congestion, competition for infrastructure and public goods, and wage depression. These costs are not borne by the foreign workers or their employers; instead, they are borne by society.\nThe standard economic response to this market failure is to impose a tax that forces the parties in the economic exchange - in this case, the foreign workers and their employers - to internalise the social costs of their exchange. This provides the economic justification for the foreign worker levy that the Government imposes on employers who hire low-skilled foreign workers.\nEconomically speaking, it does not matter which party the Government imposes the tax on. Economics predicts that the foreign worker levy would be borne by workers."}

For those who can't get enough of this buzzworthy new adventure, a new four-minute trailer has arrived with even more exciting and action-packed footage. Guardians has been set to hit Russian theaters on February 23, 2017, although a domestic release date has not been set at this time.\nGuardians is a completely original superhero movie that isn't based on any existing comic books or other stories. While the name Guardians will naturally lead to the movie being compared to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie is not set in the cosmos, and is more similar to Fantastic Four. For the fans who were disappointed by last year's Fantastic Four reboot, Guardians may just be the movie they've been waiting for, as you can see in this trailer from YouTube.\nAfter spending years hiding in the shadows during the Cold War era, a group of heroes, created by an organization called \"Patriot\" must show themselves again. These heroes include a man who can manipulate stone (Sebastien Sisak), another who is a half-man, half-bear (Anton Pampushnyy), a woman who has the ability to manipulate and turn herself into a form of water (Alina Lanina) and a teleporter who uses a pair of enormous sickle weapons (Sanzhar Madiev). These heroes all come from different Soviet republics, but they must unite to save their collective homeland.\nGuardians is set for release in Russia on February 23, 2017, although there is no U.S. release date set at this time. It isn't known if there is even a U.S. distributor in place, but the movie has also secured a release in China next spring, although no date has been given yet. The supporting cast includes Alina Kiziyarova, Valeriya Shkirando, Marusya Klimova, Vyacheslav Razbegaev, Stanislav Shirin, Nikolay Shestak and Aleksandr Semyonov.\nIn addition to the trailer, we also have five posters showcasing these heroes. The movie was produced with a budget of 330 million Rubles, which is the equivalent of 20 million U.S. dollars. Guardians is directed by Sarik Andreasyan, who directed last year's indie thriller American Crime starring Hayden Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, from a script by Andrey Gavrilov.

Upon his arrival in London in June 1982, he began sending signals back to Rome that if he was imprisoned he would tell everything he knew.\nIf he had carried out this threat, a lot of mud would have stuck to the many figures in Italy's financial and political elite, because of the nature of Banco Ambrosiano, the bank at the centre of the case.\nCalvi had been the chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican held a significant stake - a link that inspired Calvi's nickname, \"God's banker\". It has also been reported that he had connections to a masonic lodge known as P2 or Propaganda Due. These connections would have brought him into contact with many of Italy's movers and shakers in politics, business, the civil service and Italian intelligence.\nBanco Ambrosiano, which collapsed with \u00a3800million in debts, was used by the mafia to launder its money from the drugs trade. It was also the finance house through which unlawful payments were made by large corporations to leading Italian politicians.\nIf information is power, then as chairman of Ambrosiano, Calvi wielded a lot as he knew of the myriad money trails that meandered through his bank. But his knowledge also made him vulnerable to those who felt under threat if he went public.\nThe New York-born investigator Jeff Katz, who was hired by Calvi's family in 1991 to look into his death, said those who went on trial were alleged middlemen in the Calvi scandal.\n\"They were on trial for alleged conspiracy to commit murder,\" he said. \"They were not the people who allegedly decided to have him killed and they were not the people who put the rope around his neck.\"\nInvestigators claim Calvi was lured on to a Thames riverboat by the mafia in June 1982. He was then strangled from behind with a rope and concrete bricks were stuffed in his trouser pockets along with $15,000 (\u00a37,500) in cash. A noose was made with the rope, placed round his neck and his body was hung on scaffolding by Blackfriars bridge to appear as if he had committed suicide.\nAn inquest in London initially ruled that his death was suicide, but after a high court challenge by Calvi's family, a second inquest was held and an open verdict was recorded.\nIn 2003 Italian prosecutors concluded that the banker had been killed, and in October 2005 four men and a woman went on trial in Rome for his murder.\nMr Katz, who spent three years reconstructing the circumstances of Calvi's death, played a key role in uncovering evidence that he could not have committed suicide.\n\"It is now accepted that Calvi was murdered,\" said Mr Katz, now chief executive of the London-based corporate investigations company Bishop International. \"It was only last year that London police accepted that it was a case of murder.

In essence, the service is aimed at giving travelers the tools to build their own travel guides in order to explore the world as they want.\nWe use and review a lot of apps at TNW and I\u2019ll admit up front that Dcovery is one of my favorites \u2014 and not just because its founders live in my adopted country of Thailand. Anyone who travels regularly \u2014 be it for business or pleasure \u2014 has reason to download this app since it really does help you seek out and, most importantly, actually visit places that interest you. And that\u2019s the name of the game when it comes to travel.\nThe Dcovery team dubs the app \u2018Evernote for travel\u2019 and, while that three word description gives a basic up-front explanation of what the app does, it does do it a slight disservice. That\u2019s to say the Dcovery is far more than just note storage and organization, since it brings place discovery in a way that other apps and services can\u2019t do at scale.\nThe application is fresh out of a near-nine-month close beta testing period and has launched on the App Store today, priced $3.99. I was lucky enough to sneak into the beta earlier this year and have been hugely impressed from day one. So, without further ado, let\u2019s take a look at what Dcovery is all about.\n\u201cThe spirit of Dcovery is to make it easy for people go online and build their own travel guides,\u201d Canadian Bellemare tells me. That mantra runs right through the service, which consists of the iPhone app and a Web bookmark, know as \u2018Place Finder\u2019.\nDcovery lets users organize places of interest through \u2018city guides\u2019, which can be customized to include whatever places of interest a user is taken by. For example, I could build a guide to Beijing that includes details of cool noodle bars, and nothing else, if that\u2019s my thing.\nEach city guide contains the locations, photographs and other basic information and details for each place of interest. Each setting and piece of data can be tweaked and changed as necessary, so you can add more pictures, makes notes and any other things that you want to remember about any given place.\nThe iOS app is where most of the action takes place, since that is the standard portable device for most. Users access their personalized guidebooks and add new locations via their phone but, given that most of us spend an awful lot of time online from a laptop or PC, Place Finder is a super handy tool that gathers information for guides in a breeze.\nIt works very much like Evernote\u2019s own Web clipper and, if you browse a website with details about places of interest, hotels, etc, you can click on Place Finder and it will automatically find and load all travel related details from the page into the sidebar. From there, you can make any edits and save the location and its details into your Dcovery guide.\nThe service grabs data from its own content system \u2014 which the team built using an array of open source systems and algorithms that match duplicate places and scout for new data \u2014 and it also pulls in information from Foursquare and Google+ Local. That bevvy of sources provides map information, photos, comments and other data, such as opening times. In addition to stashing the details in the app, the webpage itself is also archived into the guide, both of which are immediately synced to the iOS app and made available for offline viewing.\nYou can also manually add location that are not automatically recognised"}

Twenty-five years after the Cold War ended, relations are back in a deep freeze. What happened?\nThe current tension did not come about because the United States suddenly wanted its old adversary back. What happened is a response to bad choices taken by President Vladimir Putin of Russia. These choices were made deliberately in Moscow, perhaps for Mr. Putin\u2019s own reasons of domestic politics and foreign policy. They are the main reason for the tension that now exists.\nMr. Putin chose to seize Crimea from Ukraine, annex it and then instigate an armed insurrection in southeastern Ukraine in 2014, violating all post-World War II norms of national sovereignty. The war in the Donbas region was a tactic by Mr. Putin to inject further instability into Ukraine after Ukraine\u2019s president, Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych, fled his palace in the face of mass protest. Mr. Putin was aggrieved at Ukraine\u2019s decision to sign a pact with the European Union, but Ukraine is not a vassal of Russia, and Mr. Putin\u2019s claims to a sphere of influence are untenable. The sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe were a response to Mr. Putin\u2019s ill-considered impulse to use violence as a tool of intimidation and coercion.\nAnother poor and deliberate choice was to interfere with the U.S. election campaign. Mr. Putin cannot escape responsibility for Russian attempts to damage the candidacy of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and, perhaps, tilt the election to Donald Trump. We know that Mr. Putin seethed over Ms. Clinton\u2019s outspoken support for the principle of free speech during the 2011-2013 protests against him, but he is altogether wrong to think the United States engineered the unrest. Mr. Putin and his aides cynically deny they attempted to interfere in the U.S. election, but surely they know exactly what occurred and how. The sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama last December and recently tightened by Congress did not appear out of thin air. They are a logical response to Mr. Putin\u2019s attempt to meddle in American democracy.\nHave these choices had positive consequences for Russia or global stability? Mr. Putin behaves as though he believes Russia is walking tall. Perhaps in his zero-sum world, he takes satisfaction in the chaos rippling through U.S. politics, but his tactics have backfired badly in both Ukraine and the United States. And Mr. Putin\u2019s choices have been costly for Russia, its economy and its people.\nWe have long believed that U.S.-Russian engagement is essential to avert miscalculation, and it remains important for both Washington and Moscow to keep talking. But Mr. Putin should not expect the West to suddenly forgive or forget his bad choices. He would be wiser to deal with the underlying source of tension than to sit around plotting new ways to escalate it.\nThe Post\u2019s View: Russian propaganda has flooded U.S. airwaves.

There are no restrictions on the number of times golfers can play.

Experts remain divided.\nWithout a will, assets must go through the probate process. That\u2019s an immediate cost to your client\u2019s survivors. And the estate lawyer\u2019s fees aren\u2019t always a percentage of the estate. Most lawyers charge fixed amounts, which could run into thousands of dollars.\nIn most provinces, if clients don\u2019t have spouses or children, their assets go to their parents. But some young people have siblings or friends with greater financial need. Some might also want to make charitable gifts. Plus, uncertainty around how to handle an estate puts bereaved family members through much more grief.\nThere\u2019s more to a will than listing who gets what. The document should specify who manages the estate after your client dies. If she has minor children, it should address guardianship and any trust funds. Your client should also draft power of attorney and healthcare directives in case of physical or mental incapacity.\nThe healthcare directive can specify where she will live (home, hospice, LTC, etc.), what her activities (hobbies, trips, day-to-day physical activities, etc.) will be, and who can visit her. In many provinces, a client can also address end-of-life wishes in the healthcare directive. She can specify the treatment she wants if she enters a vegetative state, or how long she would want to be on life support. Laws in most provinces specify that whoever you appoint must follow your wishes, regardless of what he or she may think is best.\nIf your client has special medical conditions, the directive could facilitate decisions about what kinds of treatments can be tried. She could also specify preferences for organ donation.\nDigital assets are also becoming part of estate planning [Editor\u2019s note: look for our article on this topic in the November issue of Advisor\u2019s Edge]. Our questionnaires ask about email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Dropbox accounts. Technically your client\u2019s executor would be in charge of her online identity, unless she specifies otherwise.\nWe recommend people keep a separate list with their usernames and passwords, list of bank accounts and safety deposit boxes, etc., and tell the executor or appointee how to find that list.\nOther unusual assets young people might wish to list in their wills are reward points\u2014anything that could potentially be transferred. They might wish to leave instructions about how to use biological material such as frozen sperm or eggs; these are sensitive issues, and the family could be left in a quandary without specific instructions from the testator. Writers, musicians and designers might also want to leave specific instructions about copyright and royalties.\nIn most provinces, people can draft legal wills once they reach the age of majority. However, those under 18 can have wills in special circumstances: if they\u2019re getting married or have high-risk jobs (e.g., military officer), or if the court approves a document for them. (People who travel to dangerous designations are often granted wills, regardless of age).\nTell clients it\u2019s time to think about wills as soon as they have anything in their names, such as bank accounts, RRSPs or TFSAs. Young people should also draft wills when they receive inheritances. If they have life insurance through work, they can name the estate as beneficiary and let a will govern the proceeds\u2019 distribution.\nIf your client moves outside Canada, review the will and make sure it is still valid in that country.

The information can change based on the user\u2019s location, time of day or preference of Ashkenazi or Sephardi customs, he said.\nChanging the way people learn is just what the Union for Reform Judaism is planning in its congregational Hebrew schools.\nIn August, URJ will roll out a digital format of its Mitkadem Hebrew school curriculum, which will allow students to communicate virtually with each other and their teachers. Students will work in small groups through each level of the curriculum, focusing on prayers, the meaning behind the prayers and vocabulary while the teachers act as facilitators, testing at each level. This will allow students to work at their own pace in the classroom and work remotely with teachers outside of class, said Michael Goldberg, URJ\u2019s head of books and music.\n\u201cThey relate to each other online on a regular basis anyway, but there\u2019s something powerful about meeting virtually and in person,\u201d he said.\nIn one pilot program, a student who plans to travel to Scotland next year with his parents will use Mitkadem to keep up with his Judaic studies back home. Students, Goldberg said, have reacted positively to the classroom innovations, and URJ eventually hopes to expand the program to every aspect of Jewish education.\nSome catch-up might be necessary for educators, however. Teachers are the \u201cdigital immigrants\u201d in the classroom, while students are the natives, said Wendy Light, director of integrated education in the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism\u2019s education department.

At 1445 GMT, Lloyds shares were up 1 percent at 86.49 pence.\nOsborne is determined to sell some of the shares to retail investors, mirroring the 1980s privatisation drive of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher aimed at encouraging ordinary Britons to invest in companies.\nLloyds is attractive to private investors because of the dividends it is expected to pay out in the coming years.

Wicked Audio released an affordable product that doesn't compromise much.\nMy primary form of exercise and relaxation is running outside and music is a big part of that experience. I've tested a number of headphones over the years and have moved to the truly wireless form factor found in earbuds like the Apple AirPods and Jabra Elite Active 65t. These models are good, but they also start at $160 so they aren't for everyone.\nWicked Audio PR reached out to me to gauge my interest in evaluating its new Arq wireless earbuds and I jumped at the chance since the $79.99 price seemed way too good to be true. After testing the earbuds out for the past couple of weeks I am no longer a skeptic.\nThere are indeed compromises that are made in order to have truly wireless earbuds for less than $100, but Wicked Audio gets the fundamentals right and gives up on some of the conveniences and advanced controls found on other expensive headsets.\nThere is no water resistant rating on the earbuds, but Wicked Audio stated the exterior is sweat resistant and designed to withstand active lifestyles. I went running with them once and also wore them in light rain and they still work just fine so these conditions may be acceptable for their use. I haven't tested them in a downpour and they do not have an official water resistant rating so keep that in mind.\nThe earbuds are very lightweight and I've been able to wear them for hours with no discomfort at all. The Arq earbuds are rated for three hours of music playback and I personally saw just a bit longer than that over the past two weeks.\nThe earbuds are fairly generic looking with an all black finish, a single button on each one, and a small red/blue LED light. The stem that fits into your ear is angled so they fit my ear well and stayed in during my run. There are small, medium, and large silicone tips included with the medium ones fitting me well. While the fit may not be as secure as some other earbuds, the light weight helps them stay in place too.\nThe single button is one of the compromises since the button only supports powering on/off, play/pause of music, and answer/hang up of calls. There are no volume controls, mute option, or even a digital assistant function with these single button on each earbud.\nOne rather interesting aspect of these earbuds is that each serves as a \"master\" that can stand-alone without the other earbud connected. Thus, the buttons perform the same function and you could just use one at a time if you want another ear open for ambient noise.\nAnother area of compromise is in regards to usability. When you remove the Arq earbuds from the case, they do not turn on automatically and also do not turn off when you reinsert them. They also do not charge automatically and require that you turn on the charging case, using the button centered between the two earbud openings in the charging case, in order to initiate charging. The case will turn off and stop charging the earbuds once they are fully charged though.\nInitial setup is also a bit interesting given the \"master\" design.

If the danger rating reaches catastrophic, you should leave as soon as possible, as no home will be defendable in those conditions.\nYour local ABC Radio is your emergency broadcaster, so keep a battery powered radio with extra batteries (or a wind-up one) so that you can hear the latest up-dates on any situation should you lose power.\nYour local ABC website also gives the latest weather forecast and advice on preparing an emergency kit as well as coverage of any current situations.\nFor more tips on how to prepare your property and prepare yourself for the bushfire season, visit the TFS website."}

{"idx": "24737", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Passing the budget: Senate, House, and now . . . ?\nSen. Lawton Chiles perhaps summed it up best when he said that last week's bipartisan Senate enactment of a budget resolution ''bodes well for the country.'' What would have boded badly would have been no decision by the Senate on the budget - what with future deficits now projected at $200 billion or more annually and threatening economic recovery. So in finally hammering out a compromise - although by the razor-thin margin of one vote (50-to-49) - the Senate has paved the way for a final budget resolution for fiscal year 1984.\nLast week's action, of course, does not mean that a final budget will be easy to obtain. Obstacles are considerable. The Senate measure, and the version passed by the House, are sharply different in many respects, especially regarding tax increases. Further, President Reagan has been adamant in recent weeks in saying that he would veto any major tax increase for the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe need therefore, seems clear: Senate and House conferees must make every reasonable effort to craft a mutually acceptable compromise, especially regarding tax hikes and defense spending. The White House, at the same time, must avoid the temptation to work against adoption of any compromise budget at all, a course favored by some top administration officials unreconciled to revenue increases. The projected deficits are far too serious for entering the new fiscal year with no budget resolution at all. The deficit for fiscal 1983 alone is now projected at $210 billion or more, far larger than had been anticipated. By 1987 deficits could be approaching $300 billion, with borrowing by the Treasury to finance such intolerable levels crowding out private borrowing and sharply boosting interest rates to the detriment of the economy.\nWhat kind of budget, then, should be adopted - a budget that Congress, the White house and the American people could accept? The answer would seem to be along the lines of the Senate budget - combined with the defense spending levels contained in the House package.\n* Under the Senate budget, tax revenues would be increased by $8.9 billion for fiscal 1984. One possible way to raise that amount, as proposed by moderate Republicans, would be to impose a cap (of say, $500 per taxpayer) on the 10 percent tax cut scheduled to begin July 1. There would still be a tax cut, as sought by Mr. Reagan, though reduced from $30 billion to slightly over $20 billion. Also, by adopting such a compromise, Congress would not have to repeal or postpone indexation of tax rates now scheduled to begin in 1985.\n* Under the House budget, defense spending would rise by about 5 percent in real terms. That is only slightly below the 6 percent increase sought by the Senate - and for that matter, not all that far from the 7 percent hike proposed in the GOP-backed budget that was defeated in the Senate. Adopting the lower House figure would in no way impair US national security. What it would do is hold down the rate of growth of defense spending."}

New Delhi has also been alarmed by China\u2019s moves to build strategic and economic ties with Indian Ocean nations including Sri Lanka, the Maldives and India\u2019s longtime rival Pakistan.\nChina for its part resents India\u2019s hosting of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, and its control of territory Beijing says belongs to it.\nChina claims some 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) of territory in India\u2019s northeast, while India says China occupies 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) of its territory on the Aksai Chin Plateau in the western Himalayas. Officials have met at least 20 times to discuss the competing border claims without making significant progress.\nFollowing the most protracted standoff in years, India last year agreed to pull back troops from the disputed Doklam Plateau high in the Himalayas, where Chinese troops had begun constructing a road. China claims the strategically important region, but India says it belongs to ally Bhutan.\nDespite such differences, Modi hopes China can help drive Indian economic growth ahead of national elections next year.\nHowever, his administration has been notably reluctant to engage with Beijing\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative linking its economy to those of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe through massive loans and investments.\nGiven the state of relations, the Wuhan summit should be seen as a conscientious attempt to steer ties in a new direction, said Wang Lian, a professor at elite Peking University\u2019s School of International Relations.\n\u201cThis meticulously planned meeting will offer the leaders more time to discuss current issues and the future blueprint for bilateral relations,\u201d Wang said.\nRegardless of the current visit\u2019s outcome, Modi appears intent on building a strong personal relationship with Xi, who will be China\u2019s leader for years to come following the lifting of term limits on the presidency.\nModi will be traveling to China again in June for a summit of the eight-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization dominated by Beijing and Moscow.\nAlong with China, Russia and India, that group includes the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan as well as Pakistan."}

His dough-making procedure takes 36 hours to complete, and since refrigeration would compromise his and its integrity, he makes only a limited amount each day. When he runs out, that\u2019s it, shop closed. Naturally, this annoys people who have a more relaxed attitude about pizza. Mangieri ignores those people. He figures they\u2019d be better off at Chuck E. Cheese. His is the only opinion that matters, and the proof, he knows, is in the pie. And what a pie it is\u2014tender and juicy, the crust deeply flavored by its marathon fermentation. The cornicione has the right amount of soft chew, the outer surface a fleeting, paper-thin crackle.

In its proposal, the FCC said that while \"other forms of discrimination in the Internet ecosystem may exist \"\u00a6 such conduct is beyond the scope of this proceeding.\"\nThe argument comes at a time when Internet regulation is up for grabs: A federal court struck down the FCC's old net-neutrality rules earlier this year, and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is now trying to rework the rules in a way that can survive future court challenges. His proposal has sparked a massive backlash because it would allow broadband providers to charge websites for faster service as long as the agreements are \"commercially reasonable.\"\nMichael Weinberg, vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said net neutrality is really about preventing Internet service providers from abusing their power as \"gatekeepers\" of all Internet content.

{"idx": "24748", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A retail operation relies on marketing to attract customers, and the success of that marketing relies on a plan. When beginning to write your plan, focus on the three elements of marketing: identification of your target market, understanding its buying habits and needs, and evaluating the strengths of your own company with respect to satisfying your target customer. Effective retail marketing creates a need in the mind of your customer, validates that need and presents your product as the best solution. Also, because you have competition selling the same or similar products, market your store to cultivate your target customer's trust, enjoyment and willingness to evangelize.\nSet your time frame to one year, with sections devoted to key retail periods such as holidays, back-to-school season or any other annual demand period for your products. Perform a SWOT analysis of your previous year's performance during these periods by writing down strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats you experienced in your retailing activities. Examine specifics such as your product mix, merchandizing, fulfillment, customer response and your customer service. Identify your goals and then develop strategies that build on your strengths and opportunities while limiting your weaknesses and threats. These strategies form the core of your marketing plan. In the next section, create a budget to cover your promotions, advertising, sales reps, customer community development and customer service. Finish your plan with a calendar listing your planned promotion dates, advertising deadlines, sales campaigns, customer education and appreciation events.\nIn setting strategies, remember retailing is more than just selling. A good example is the marketing of diamonds. In 1938, the advertising firm N.W. Ayer was hired by Harry Oppenheimer, son of the founder of DeBeers, to spearhead diamond marketing in America. Ayer designed a marketing campaign to alter the social customs and regard for diamonds, linking them with romance and glamor and making them a necessary part of all weddings. In later years, the campaign produced the iconic marketing slogan \"A diamond is forever,\" which DeBeers used successfully for decades. Even if you are selling trinkets or snacks, think of how you can elevate the value of your offerings in the eyes of your customers. Value can be found in convenience, low prices, high quality, large selection, staff knowledge, store ambiance and customer service.\nCreate marketing tactics that include social media marketing. If you retail online, search engine optimization isn't the only way to drive customers to your website. Opening a branch store on an auction site, promoting your products with pictures and non-aggressive sales copy on social networks, and maintaining an active monthly newsletter for your customers are all vital elements for your marketing plan. Convenient and user-friendly shopping cart, delivery and customer service experience also can become an element of your marketing message.\nBrick and mortar storefronts also have to attract customers with tactics. Include plans for window displays as a major attraction. Also plan ways to bring in new customers by holding events in your store. Events can range in subject from product demonstrations to local civic meetings, but they must be interesting and varied enough to attract people who have never visited your store. These events create a customer community, which in turn creates customer loyalty -- an important element that can be much less expensive and more effective than merely advertising your products and location in the local print, radio and television media.\nThe Atlantic: Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond?"}

(SVU: Charts, News), rose sharply on Tuesday after the company reported significantly lower fourth quarter earnings. SuperValu stock rose +0.81 or +15.2 percent Tuesday, on heavy volume of 38,452,182 shares in active trading on the NYSE.\nEden Prairie, MN based SuperValu Inc. is the nation's third largest grocery retailer and distributor after Safeway and Kroger's. The company, which operates over 4,300 stores nationwide, has struggled recently with the economic slump. SuperValu operates well known supermarkets chains such as Albertson's and Jewel, Shaw's and discount chain, Save-A-Lot. While the company reported better than expected net income after charges, net sales for its fiscal fourth quarter fell to $8.23 billion, a decline of 5 percent from last year's fourth quarter sales of $8.66 billion. According to SuperValu, the drop in sales was due to the sale of fueling stations and food store closures. Margins also fell, with gross profit margin for Q4 falling to $1.9 billion or 22.8 percent of net sales, compared to the previous year's Q4 results of $2.0 billion or 23.3 percent of net sales. Tuesday's sharp rise in SuperValu stock was mostly attributed to its guidance for its fiscal 2013 yearly earnings. The company expects per share earnings results in a range of $1.27 to $1.42. According to a survey of 14 market analysts conducted by Zacks Investment Research, the consensus was for earnings of $1.19 for fiscal 2013. The company's stock has been under pressure since May of 2011, when it was trading over $11 per share, causing speculation the company was headed towards bankruptcy. This created a large short position - short ratio of 13.4 - in the stock which recently sank to its 52 week low of $5.07 per share. In a post earnings interview, CEO and President, Craig Herkert stated that, \"We are committed to fair price plus promotions and will intensify our efforts as we enter the second year of our business transformation. As we move into fiscal 2013, we see another year of improving identical store sales and will continue to take appropriate steps to deliver greater value to our customers and move closer to becoming America's Neighborhood Grocer.\" As signs of an improving economy continue to materialize, supermarket chains will most likely be major beneficiaries. With a depressed stock price and a large short position, SuperValu may have seen an intermediate bottom in its stock price.

Today, 24 Hour Fitness announced that it is leaning on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Adobe Experience Cloud to deliver a custom, personalized experience to meet each members\u2019 needs.\nI had a chance to speak with Tom Lapcevic, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for 24 Hour Fitness, about the decision to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Adobe Experience Cloud, and what the ultimate goal is for the company. He told me that the high-level mission at 24 Hour Fitness is to transform the lives of members through fitness.\nThe question becomes, \u201cWhat is the best way to accomplish that goal?\u201d Each member is a unique individual. They are starting from different places. They have different objectives in mind. They have different lifestyles and availability to go to a gym. They enjoy different types of exercise or respond better to one form of fitness over another. The bottom line is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to health and fitness.\nLapcevic explained that the name 24 Hour Fitness was a reflection of the fact that its facilities are open 24 hours a day. That isn\u2019t actually true of every 24 Hour Fitness facility\u2014for example, the one closest to my house is not actually open 24 hours a day all week\u2014but that\u2019s a discussion for a different story. 24 Hour Fitness facilities were designed to provide everything a member could want for fitness and exercise under one roof.\nThe combination of convenience and availability when you have everything from weights, to swimming, to basketball courts, to yoga classes all in one place is definitely helpful, but it still requires members to have both the availability and discipline to make the trip and show up. Let\u2019s face it\u2014many people lack the availability, or the discipline, or both.\nThe new vision for 24 Hour Fitness is that the name is less about having brick-and-mortar facilities that are open 24 hours a day, and more about how 24 Hour Fitness as a company can be there for members and help them reach their own fitness objectives 24 hours a day no matter where they are. Lapcevic stressed that 24 Hour Fitness isn\u2019t purely about exercise. Movement is just one of the four pillars 24 Hour Fitness supports to help members achieve complete health and fitness. The other three pillars are mindset, nutrition and regeneration.\nThe whole thing makes perfect sense to me. In the same way that Facebook can tailor ads based on what I like, and my activity online, or the way Amazon can make recommendations to me about things I might want to buy based on what other people with similar shopping profiles have purchased, it makes sense to gather the data we have available and leverage technology to develop a uniquely personal fitness experience. Providing members with tips, reminders, and guidance that are relevant to where they are in their fitness journey and designed specifically to help them achieve the goals they themselves have set will hopefully work to keep people more engaged. If people feel more inspired and less intimidated, maybe they will continue putting in the effort beyond the honeymoon phase of their New Year\u2019s resolution and actually achieve long term"}

That was after a state helicopter ferried the governor between the scenic shore getaway and the gridlocked state capital, where he and lawmakers gained about as much ground as drivers did during the Bridgegate scandal.\nAt issue is Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, a nonprofit insurer the state created. Christie supports legislation tied to the budget that would add more oversight to Horizon and seize reserves to fund public health causes.\nThe governor said he would sign the state's $34.7 billion budget, including $350 million in Democratic spending priorities, if lawmakers send him the bill to restructure Horizon.\nJersey City resident Laura Browntree called the shutdown \"unfortunate.\"\n\"When I first heard that casinos and the lottery would continue but certain government services wouldn't, I was disappointed,\" Browntree said Sunday. \"We look forward to the fireworks in Liberty State Park every year and we're glad (Mayor) Steve Fulop could step up to make sure it goes on at Exchange Place.\n\"We planned to be in Jersey City this weekend for the festival -- we usually go away on weekends but love it so much ... maybe Gov.

For universities, polytechnics and institutes of technology, the rates will go from 0.45 per cent to 0.5 per cent.\nThe levy is used for quality assurance and marketing, and also to reimburse international students caught out by programme and provider closures.\nLast year the tax pulled in just over $5 million, mostly from universities, with $476,478 coming from PTEs.\nHipkins said it was the first increase for this tax in 15 years, and the Ministry of Education was \"doing its bit by reducing annual expenditure commitments against the levy by $300,000\".\n\"The levy fund has to be made financially sustainable to safeguard our international reputation for education and continue to support the wellbeing of our international students.\n\"It almost ran out this year due to payouts resulting from closures at PTEs.\"\nHipkins said further work was being done to recognise quality in the PTE sector.\n\"It may be possible in future to introduce a system where PTEs that are delivering a consistently high-quality service might pay a lower levy, while the few PTEs falling into risk categories, including having previous quality issues, might face a higher one.\"\nThe new tax rates take effect from January 1, 2019.\nThe tax was defended by the bosses of Education NZ, the Government agency that builds international education sector, who appeared before the education and workforce select committee yesterday.\n\"We are supportive of the levy model to make sure the student has a very good experience,\" Education NZ chief executive Grant McPherson said.\nNational MP Simeon Brown asked whether declining international student numbers - including about 20 per cent fewer students from China - were due to Government rhetoric about cracking down on low-quality international education courses.\nEducation NZ chair Charles Finny said the rhetoric was not a factor, but uncertainty around the government review this year may have been a factor.\nChanges from the review, announced in August, mean it will be harder for international students to work in New Zealand after finishing studying.\n\"The fact of a review may have been an issue, but Australia has had a similar decline of the same scale from students from China,\" Finny told the committee.\n\"The feedback from key agents and governments has been positive ...

Exchanges between the Rev. Douglas I. Miles of BUILD (Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development) and council President Sheila Dixon, as reported by The Sun's Jill Rosen, amounted to verbal fisticuffs. Shouts and yelling, microphones cut off, voices raised in defiance - so much for civil discourse.\nBUILD's anger about public investment in a downtown hotel is understandable, but misplaced. Neighborhoods served by BUILD churches may indeed be marred by blight and in desperate need of revitalization, but city financing of a revenue-generating hotel can't be equated with public funding for a housing development. Parking lots and hotels can be built with revenue bonds, but housing complexes generally require a different financing vehicle such as community development bonds. To suggest, as BUILD does, that city revenue bonds could be redirected to develop more housing, eradicate blight or reinforce police presence is misleading.\nRevenue bonds require an identifiable source to pay off the bonds, such as parking fees or hotel receipts and taxes. Community development bonds, on the other hand, often are used to raze vacant houses, help homeowners repair properties, generate affordable housing and stabilize city neighborhoods. This year alone, voters approved $33.5 million in such loans, which the city repays out of general funds.\nBUILD's pastors may have a beef with council President Dixon over a purported campaign pledge to seek public financing for a preferred project, but attacking her publicly won't advance their cause. Ms. Dixon countered BUILD's accusations of neighborhood neglect with a list of community projects that received public aid, including a $31 million homeownership project in Sandtown, a mixed-income residential development in West Baltimore known as Heritage Crossing and the Harlem Gardens senior citizens housing development.\nThe public has every right to voice its opinion on the convention center hotel project, and taxpayers should participate in its review. But simply shouting, \"We oppose! We oppose!\" is neither compelling nor convincing."}

Only hope for his daughter and the rest of Generation Hot can deliver us from crisis and into recovery and rejuvenation.\nWe can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t warn us.\nThe report released by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week is only the latest and most dire in a string of scientific declarations leading back to 1988, when NASA scientist James Hansen\u2019s landmark testimony to the United States Senate put man-made global warming on the public agenda.\nAs a journalist who has reported on climate change from dozens of countries since then, I can\u2019t say I was surprised by the IPCC\u2019s report.

But the report did provoke other emotions, because I read it not only as a journalist, but also as a father. And as a father, I felt grief, fear, rage, frustration and, finally, a determination to resist. One emotion I never permit myself, however, is despair. For despair only paralyzes at a time when action is urgently needed.\nMy daughter Chiara, the central character in HOT, is turning nine this weekend.

I sometimes wish Chiara had Harry and Hermione\u2019s magic skills; they\u2019d come in mighty handy in the future the IPCC is projecting.\nThe grief and fear the IPCC report triggered in me stems from a central fact of our climate future: Everyone on earth below the age of 25 is already fated to spend much of their lifetime coping with the hottest temperatures our civilization has ever encountered. The laws of physics and chemistry\u2014above all, the fact that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for many decades after being emitted\u2014mean that even if humans stopped all carbon emissions overnight, global temperatures would nevertheless keep rising for at least 30 more years.\nNow apply that calculation to the first great human disaster with a scientifically attributable climate fingerprint: the record heat wave that scorched Europe in 2003. It caused 71,499 excess deaths, considerably more than the number of U.S. casualties in the Vietnam war. But thanks to the physical momentum of climate change, the record heat of 2003 will be routine before Chiara is my age. By 2050, Europeans will experience summers as hot as 2003 one year out of every two.\nThe higher temperatures locked in for the forthcoming decades will, in turn, unleash climate impacts that will affect every person on earth. IPCC reports are written in conservative scientific language, so let me translate some of these projected impacts into plain English.\nAmong the most worrisome impacts are what the IPCC calls the \u201cbreakdown of food systems,\u201d as heat waves, droughts and downpours slash crop yields.

He spent five years leading the English folk band Fairport Convention, then a decade as half a duo with his then-wife Linda Thompson. For the past 20 years, he has worked solo.\nThompson was \"boxed\" once before in the early SSRq90s on a collection of out-takes and obscurities. This one contains the seminal tracks from some 30 albums, a few of them live and others up to 10 minutes in length. It will take months to absorb the breadth of it.\nWhen all is finished, Thompson has done for traditional British folk balladry what the Band did for backwoods Americana \u2014 electrified it and brought it into the 20th century. The brightness of his muscular guitar work contrasts vividly with his chocolate baritone, and the economy of his lyrics in such story songs as Beeswing and 1952 Vincent Black Lightning is something to behold.\nWinnipeggers who saw Thompson's concert at the Garrick last spring know what the man can do with just a microphone and a guitar. Backed by a full band (not to mention being supported by the late Sandy Denny and Linda's lead vocals), he is occasionally overwhelming.\nThe package includes a photo-studded booklet with a fine retrospective essay by Patrick Humphries and a detailed chronological discography.\nEVERYBODY'S favourite reggae-loving, rap-spewing Hasidic Jew returns with his third studio effort, 13 tracks of positivity and spirituality filled with everything from skittery pop to dub and featuring appearances from members of Fishbone and Sublime.\nLight might be his least reggae-influenced album yet, but there are still traces of his love of dancehall on Smash Lies and One Day. So Hi So Lo has more in common with the sunny California grooves of Sublime than traditional Jamaican music. I Will Be Light is a dub-heavy jam. Oh Nature is a straight-up hip-hop track, climaxing with uplifting gang chorus vocals. Motivate brings out the rock guitars and Darkness and Light is a mishmash of everything that came before.\nIT'S an almost unbelievable statistic, but iconic songwriter Willie Nelson's most successful album was his 1978 American standards collection Stardust, which sold more than five million copies.\nNow, after more than 30 years, he delivers something of a followup, donating his strangely appealing nasal vocals to 11 loungey jazz standards. Most of the regular suspects are here: The Nearness of You, Fly Me to the Moon, Ain't MisbehavinSSRq and Baby, It's Cold Outside, featuring Norah Jones. Diana Krall also turns up on If I Had You, a song she could sing in her sleep.

While the academic literature has spawned numerous case studies and context- or policy-specific models for collaboration, the growth of these innovative collaborative governance systems has outpaced the scholarship needed to define it. Collaborative Governance Regimes breaks new conceptual and practical ground by presenting an integrative framework for working across boundaries to solve shared problems, a typology for understanding variations among collaborative governance regimes, and an approach for assessing both process and productivity performance. This book draws on diverse literatures and uses rich case illustrations to inform scholars and practitioners about collaborative governance regimes and to provide guidance for designing, managing, and studying such endeavors in the future. Collaborative Governance Regimes will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in public administration, public policy, and political science who want a framework for theory building, yet the book is also accessible enough for students and practitioners.\nCollaborative Governance Regimes breaks new conceptual and practical ground by presenting an integrative framework for working across boundaries to solve shared problems, a typology for understanding variations among collaborative governance regimes, and an approach for assessing both process and productivity performance.\nHoundmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire [England] ; New York : Palgrave Macmillan, 2009.\nBook \u2014 xv, 299 p. ; 23 cm.\n11: Security, Democracy and Sovereignty-- J.Castro-Rea PART II: CONTENTIOUS POLITICS: NATIONAL AND CROSS-BORDER VARIATIONS Civil Society Organizations against Free Trade Agreements in North America-- D.Brunelle& S.Dugas Paradoxes of a Transnational Civil Society in a Neoliberal World: The Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras-- J.Bandy Contesting Neoliberal Globalism and NAFTA in Rural Mexico: From State Corporatism to the Political-Cultural Formation of the Peasantry?-- A.Bartra & G.Otero Contentious Politics in Mexico: Democratization and Mobilizations after NAFTA-- J.Cadena-Roa Coalition Politics: A Political Analysis of the Strategies, Discourses and Impact of the Mexican Action Network on Free Trade (RMALC-- M.J.Massicotte PART III: CONTESTING REGIONAL GOVERNANCE The Globalized Complexities of Transborder Governance in North America-- S.Clarkson, A.Torres-Ruiz The Legalization of Transnational Political Opportunity Structures: Mobilization of NAFTA's Labor Citizen Petitions for Domestic Political Gain-- J.Graubart North American Transnational Environmental Actors and Mexico-- B.Torres NAFTA and Transnational Contention: A Decade of Alliance and Conflict over Neoliberalism-- M.Dreiling, T.Silvaggio PART IV:CONCLUSION Conclusion: Contention and Deepening North America-- S.Golob Bibliography Index.\nThis is the only book of its kind devoted to exploring contentious politics from a North American perspective including protests, social movements, transnational cont"}

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who took the lead in the attempt to lure the e-commerce giant, also declined when reached by the Dallas Business Journal.\nBut at least one commercial real estate firm thinks the city should take another shot at HQ2 if the project is back in play.\nDallas was officially rejected in November in favor of two East Coast locations for Amazon\u2019s highly publicized second headquarters project known as HQ2.\n\u201cWe competed hard, we competed well, but we did not succeed,\u201d Rawlings said at the time.\n50,000 high-paying jobs.

It could add a smaller number of jobs in New York or pick another location on its list to get some or all of the jobs originally headed for New York.\nAmazon has not leased or purchased office space for the project in New York, making it easy to withdraw its commitment, according to a report in the Washington Post, which broke the story. No specific plans to abandon New York have been made, and it is possible that Amazon could be using the threat to withdraw to put pressure on New York officials, the report notes.\nThe resistance in New York contrasts with the welcome Amazon has received in Virginia from officials, where the governor signed a law on Tuesday authorizing up to $750 million in state subsidies for the Arlington headquarters."}

{"idx": "24784", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Eboo Patel\u2019s new book, Interfaith Leadership: A Primer, came out in July, which was at least four months too early. In the heat of a bitter national election, a book calling for toned-down domestic diplomacy seemed out-of-sync with the political mood. Why talk with other people when you can vote them into submission?\nNow, after an election that has left many Americans feeling baffled, infuriated, and terrified by the beliefs of their fellow citizens, Patel\u2019s message seems a little more apt. As a longtime interfaith organizer, Patel specializes in generating peaceful conversations in tense spaces. Meanwhile, one consistent theme of the left-wing election post-mortem has been that Americans\u2014and especially white Americans, of all political stripes\u2014need better methods with which to listen to their fellow citizens.\nCan the interfaith movement play a role there? Certainly, Patel\u2019s primer is a savvy guide to pluralistic listening. But the book also illustrates some of the shortcomings that the interfaith movement brings to any larger pursuit for a more pluralistic society.\nThere may not be a unified Interfaith Movement, but Patel has been anointed as the figurehead of something. Born in India and raised a Muslim in Illinois, Patel experienced racist and Islamophobic bullying as a child. In 2002, he founded Interfaith Youth Core, a nonprofit that supports interfaith organizing on college campuses. Today, he runs the IFYC, writes books and articles, and speaks on campuses. He also served on Barack Obama\u2019s faith council.\nInterfaith Leadership is a business-school-style leadership manual grafted onto a Pluralism 101 course. It includes autobiographical details from Patel\u2019s life and sociological quick-hits about the challenges of a diverse society.\nUltimately, Patel imagines a cadre of interfaith leaders who organize pluralistic groups around common themes, such as social action. He argues that these leaders will unite people and make for a more peaceful society.\nAt its best, the book functions as a field guide to democratic compassion. Again and again, Patel pushes would-be leaders to respect other people\u2019s differences, even as they try to get inside their heads. One of the book\u2019s central sections is a case-study about an imaginary small town that welcomes a Muslim family. Rather than tell the story from the detached position of an analyst, Patel pivots from person to person, trying to understand the uncertainties and stressors that every player faces.\nLater, in a wonderful aside, Patel describes reading the New York Times each morning and trying to imagine how people he knows might read those same articles. What implications would this piece of news have in this religious community?\nThese are compassionate exercises for concerned citizens. But I do not think that they make a serious prescription for pluralism.\nMuch of Patel\u2019s small-town case study takes place in a high school, and, as I read Interfaith Leadership, I found myself wondering how my 12th grade self would have digested Patel\u2019s larger message. I grew up in east Tennessee, one of perhaps a dozen Jews in a school of more than a thousand kids. My sister and I were the most visibly Jewish kids there. Interfaith work was part of our lives, whether we liked it or not.\nTo be honest, by the end of high school, formal interfaith interaction was the last thing that I wanted.

India has concerns on giving the US access to sensitive military communication if it signs the agreement.\nInterestingly, the important STA-1 status for India came at a time when the country has finalised its decision to go in for a missile defence system from the US to protect parts of the capital New Delhi.\nAt the same forum, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo earlier announced $113 million in new US initiatives for promoting investments in infrastructure, energy and digital economy in the Indo-Pacific, tracing America\u2019s links to the region to 1794 when it set up consular presence in Calcutta, now Kolkata.\nPompeo unveiled the Trump administration\u2019s Indo-Pacific economic vision as an alternative to China\u2019s one-belt, one-road initiative without naming the country directly. But the pitch was clear as he emphasised US seeks \u201cpartnership, not dominance\u201d and it believes in strategic partnership not strategic dominance.\nRoss said the new status would provide India \u201cgreater supply chain efficiency, both for defence, and for other high-tech products\u201d, the lack of which affected nearly $9.7 billion worth of goods India could have exported from the US over the last seven years.\nThe US has given STA-1 to only 36 countries most of whom are NATO or key non-NATO allies. The secretary said that the elevated status reflects India\u2019s status as a major defence partner. It was one of the measures the two countries were discussing to advance ties after the US declared India a \u201cmajor defence partner\u201d, a designation that America has not shared with any other country.\n\u201cIt is a sign of trust, not only in the relationship, but also (in) India\u2019s capabilities as an economy and as a security partner, because it also presupposes that India has the multilateral export control regime in place which would allow the transfer of more sensitive defense technologies,\u201d said Navtej Sarna, Indian ambassador to the US.\n\u201cIt also testifies to the excellent record we have had in maintaining non-proliferation of these technologies.

{"idx": "24803", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The 2019 budget plan from the Trump administration will be delivered on Monday according to numerous reports. Federal employees should be interested as there are reportedly proposed changes to the current pay and benefits program.\nThe Heritage Foundation writes that its proposed changes to the federal pay and benefits program would reduce accrued federal employee compensation costs by about 10 percent between 2017\u20132026. The savings would total over $330 billion by 2026.\nA Heritage Foundation study found that federal employees are paid 22 percent higher wages, on average, than similar private-sector employees. A portion of their report focusing on federal pay and benefits was previously published by FedSmith.\nIt is not a surprise that some of the Heritage Foundation proposals are now working their way into ideas for changing the federal pay and benefits structure.\nWe will not have specific details until the budget is released and available for review. From the details that are now emerging, we have an idea of some of the changes that will be pursued. Many of these changes will require legislation to implement the changes. Some others could be done unilaterally by the administration.\nOne change is to change the structure for awarding within-grade increases. The changes to be proposed would slow tenure-based increases (WIGs) to a merit-based system instead of what has become an automatic pay increase based on how long an employee has worked for the government.\nCurrently, the step increases can provide an employee of about 3 percent to 5 percent pay raises. The vast majority of federal employees receive these increases based primarily on the length of time an employee has been working in the same GS grade.\nIn theory, the increases are granted if an employee is performing at an acceptable level. One report notes that 99.7 percent of federal employees receive these increases when their time in a grade has been met with little or no regard to their actual performance.\nThe reason for the large percentage of employees receiving the increases is that the current system takes about the same time and effort to withhold a step increase as to take a more severe performance or disciplinary action against an employee.\nMost supervisors do not see the benefit in withholding a step increase. If they are going to the trouble of taking action against an employee, there is more benefit to removing an employee or taking a serious adverse or disciplinary action rather than withholding a step increase.\nThe overall goal of changing the current federal human resources system is to change the older, less flexible civil service structure. The administration hopes to introduce automation, reward \u201cthe best\u201d employees with larger bonuses, make it easier to hire and fire, and provide \u201cflexibility\u201d by moving employees to geographic locations they are needed the most.\nThese philosophical changes reflect the Heritage Foundation report on the federal civil service outlined in Proposed Changes to Federal HR: From Worst Case to Possible.\nSeveral proposals to rid the workforce of less productive employees are likely to emerge, if not in the new budget proposal, then in subsequently proposed changes backed by the administration in Congress. Here are several possibilities.\nExtending the probationary period from one year to three years.\nAllowing employees to appeal their dismissal through one forum instead of up to three different forums.\nLowering the standard on the burden of proof necessary to fire a federal employee. This could be done by changing the requirement of proving that dismissing an employee will improve an agency\u2019s performance to requiring it is reasonable to assume firing the employee will improve an agency\u2019s performance.\nAlternatively, maintain separate vacation and sick leave accounts but restrict the total leave available.

{"idx": "24810", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like \u201cJourney\u201d and \u201cInside\u201d can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct. Both of these renowned games are cited by the developers at the small, Barcelona-based Nomada Studio as being influential to their work. A line can be drawn between the high artistic ambitions of those earlier games and Nomada Studio\u2019s first game, \u201cGris.\u201d \u2014 a platformer that stands as one of the most visually arresting games of this or any other year.\n\u201cGris\u201d (which means \u201cgray\u201d in Spanish) is a game about bringing color and song to the world. It is also about loss, pain, and endurance. It starts with a mystical young woman singing in the open palm of an otherworldly statue. Briefly, she is lifted into the air by the current of her song, but her exaltation ends after she loses her voice. She falls into the statue\u2019s hand, which fractures beneath her; so, she falls again, tumbling down in the sky. The woman finds herself in a world whose only feature is a black line running along the bottom of the screen which demarcates foreground and background. (Her misery is readily apparent: a tap of a button causes her to slump to the ground.) As she walks, faint lines emerge in the background giving the environment more depth. The woman rouses herself from her torpor as the background gives way to more definite shapes \u2014 from rocky outcroppings to architectural ruins. By the time she gains the ability to jump it\u2019s clear that the game is fashioned around giving players a strong aesthetic experience constructed around the expressive ability of lines, shapes, and colors.\nGuiding the woman further into the black and white world, one discovers a floating orb. Approaching the orb sets it in motion. It hovers around the woman when she is standing still and trails her like a little comet or a gigantic sperm cell when she is darting about. Seeking out orbs is a vital part of the game. Acquire enough of them and they can build bridges in the air that appear like constellations. They can also unlock things. Collecting orbs typically requires solving none-too-vexing puzzles and platforming challenges. The relaxed gameplay meshes well with the beautiful art design. I lingered over many sections of the game as I might if I were touring a gallery. \u201cGris\u201d owes its visual style to Conrad Roset, the game\u2019s creative director, who came to the project from the art world. One can only hope that his example encourages other artists to explore the medium.\nAs the woman advances further, the black and white color palette shifts to red, then green, then blue, etc. Changes of this sort occur after the woman comes across open-palmed statues. (Female statues posed in anguish constitute one of the visual motifs in the game.) Rising into the air, the protagonist balls herself up, placing her head in her hands, and from out of that posture she infuses new colors into the world. These shifts in color are so emotionally resonant that they reminded me of the visual strategy at"}

But Wellwood canceled the exercise, citing his team's hard work over the previous 90 minutes. Perhaps he was also rewarding the group for capturing its first win the day before, a 7-4 triumph over the rival Sarnia Sting following an 0-16-1 start to the season.\nWellwood, 28, inherited the worst team in the Ontario Hockey League three weeks prior. As evidenced by his patchy facial hair and the fact some players know him as \"Welly,\" he is the league's youngest head coach.\nHe wasn't looking for this job. A few years back, he became a coach practically by accident. And just six months ago, the former NHLer was out of hockey completely.\nYet the sport that once nearly killed him proved once again to be his life's passion. So at the close of practice, Wellwood reclined at his desk and did his best to explain how he wound up there.\n\"What I've realized is that you can't plan for life,\" he said, laughing. \"And you might as well just go with it.\"\nFrom the time he first laced his skates as a toddler, at his backyard rink in Oldcastle, Ontario - nine miles south of Windsor - Eric Wellwood had a gift for speed.\n\"People would come over, literally, around the entire neighborhood, and come and just watch me skate,\" he said. \"Like, they would want me to do circles as fast as I could because they couldn't believe how fast I was.\"\nOne of those people watching closely was Eric's older brother, Kyle, who went on to play 489 games in the NHL. He knew Eric's natural swiftness could take him a long way in hockey.\n\"He always had a skating stride right from a little kid that was above everybody else,\" said Kyle.\nEric's skating prowess led his local team, the Windsor Spitfires, to select him in the 2006 OHL Draft. Under the new ownership of former pros Bob Boughner and Warren Rychel, the Spitfires found themselves in a similar situation to today's Firebirds: losing a lot with a young team. Wellwood was part of the group who changed that.\nIn Wellwood's first year, Windsor finished second-last. But in 2009 and 2010, led by Taylor Hall, Ryan Ellis, and Adam Henrique, the Spitfires won back-to-back Memorial Cups. An astounding 16 players from those championship teams have since played in the NHL.\nAmong them was Wellwood, a long-shot sixth-rounder who debuted with the Flyers in 2010. For context, only 13 players picked after the fifth round have reached the NHL in the past five years.\n\"He willed his way into the NHL with his tenacious penalty killing and his speed,\" Rychel said.\nWellwood caught a break as a second-year pro, when the Flyers called him up for the final quarter of the regular season (and playoffs) to replace an injured player.\nA lockout forced Wellwood to start the 2012-13 season with the Adirondack Phantoms, the club's AHL affiliate.

The economy shrank 4 percent in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\nInflation in November ran at an annualized 73.5 percent. Again these are official figures, so the reality is bound to be worse.\nIn order to pay for imports you need foreign cash and this you only get if you export something of value.\nAs a result, bond prices have tumbled by half and credit markets are pricing in a 90 percent probability of default within a year, as Venezuela has to pay back $30 billion worth of foreign denominated debt in 2015. It\u2019s currency reserves\u2014recently propped up by a $4 billion loan from China\u2014are down to $22 billion, most of them held in gold, which is not for sale. Its total foreign debt is worth $112 billion.\nWhile inflation and economic statistics paint a somewhat accurate picture, authorities refuse to accept reality in the currency markets. The official exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar to the dollar is still fixed at 6.3. The black market trades it at 173, more than double the 75 from early 2014.\nAt least stocks are doing well. The Caracas stock exchange was up 45 percent in 2014, after a nose bleed 475 advance in 2013. Of course, this rosy picture doesn\u2019t reflect the reality of the daily lives of millions of Venezuelans who experience goods shortages of all kinds on a daily basis.\nMost of them do not own stocks, but even those who do lost almost 20 percent in real terms as inflation rose faster than market prices this year.\nFor years, Venezuela\u2019s inefficient economy has been propped up by a relatively high oil price.

And the state budget matters in a country where most industries are nationalized and everybody depends on the redistribution of scarce resources by the government.\nHowever, because of price controls, foreign exchange controls, as well as nationalization, most productive business people left the country a long time ago. This is why Venezuela now has to import almost anything apart from energy, something it could do as long as foreign money kept flowing in because of oil revenues.\nThis is no longer the case and Venezuela cannot cover it up. In order to pay for imports you need foreign cash and this you only get if you export something of value. That doesn\u2019t mean you cannot try, of course.\nThe preferred way of trying to cover up an abysmal economic policy for any banana republic is by way of the printing press. From November 2013 to November 2014, the period where data is available, the central bank of Venezuela boosted its balance sheet by 35 percent, which means it printed 437 billion bolivares to fund government expenditure.\nCredit markets are pricing in a 90 percent probability of default within a year.\nThis is all fine and dandy if there is something the government can buy with the bolivares.

It has several titles, with each book showcasing a different cuisine, such as French, Italian and Indian, and being adventurous cooks, we enjoyed learning about foods from around world.\nWe must still like those books, because they are prominently displayed on a bookshelf in our living room. From time to time, I pull one out, look through it and, just as when I first met my wife, will want to cook something I see in it.\nThat happened the other day when looking at the Time Life book on Russian cooking, which was published in 1969 and authored by Helen and George Papashvilly. It has great recipes, but the one whetting my appetite was bef Stroganov, a classic dish now made around the world. It is spelled beef stroganoff in most other food books I have, which is how I\u2019ll now refer to it.\nIn the Time Life book, other authors say the dish was created in the late 19th century for the Russian Count Pavel Stroganov. Some suggest it was a dish that was already being made at that time and was simply refined a bit.\nIf you have had stroganoff, you'll know it features tender strips of beef in a sour-cream-based sauce. Beyond those key ingredients, what else gets mixed in can vary.\nFor example, some recipes call for mushrooms, others do not; some recipes add tomato paste, others do not; and some are thickened with flour, while, again, others are not.\nThe Time Life book says its recipe follows the classic Russian version of the dish, and you\u2019ll find a variation of it here. I say variation because I halved the recipe so it would make two generous servings, perhaps something to serve for Valentine\u2019s Day, and made a few other small tweaks.\nFor example, instead of just using sour cream for the sauce, I also added a bit of beef stock. I did that because the sour cream in Canada is quite thick, and I wanted the sauce to be looser.\nThe Time Life book deliciously suggests you scatter servings of beef stroganoff with straw potatoes \u2014 thin, crisp, deep-fried strips of potato \u2014 and I have included a recipe for them, too.\nTender strips of saut\u00e9ed beef simmered a short while in a sour cream-based sauce with mushrooms and onions. Serve the stroganoff topped with straw potatoes (see recipe below) and a green vegetable, such as steamed green beans tossed with toasted walnuts and butter. Or, if desired, instead of straw potatoes, serve the stroganoff with egg noodles, steamed rice or rice pilaf.\nPlace mustard, sugar and water in a small bowl and mix to combine. Cover and set aside until needed below.\nPlace 2 tsp butter and 2 tsp oil in 10- or 12-inch heavy skillet set over medium heat.

Roy Cooper\u2019s lawyers could appeal the trial judges\u2019 decision to the state Supreme Court.\nRALEIGH \u2013 A panel of state judges decided Monday that a recent North Carolina Supreme Court ruling favoring Gov. Roy Cooper means only a portion of a 2017 law combining the state ethics and elections boards is now struck down.\nThe unanimous order by three trial court judges is a victory for Republicans at the General Assembly, who two weeks after the Jan. 26 ruling passed small changes related to the combined board\u2019s membership and Cooper\u2019s powers. At the time, GOP leaders said they believed that was enough to conform to the Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion.\nCooper\u2019s lawyers had argued the Supreme Court ruling meant the judges should void the entire law. That would have opened the door to Cooper\u2019s wishes. He wanted the law to revert to what it was before December 2016 \u2013 separate elections and ethics boards, and Democrats getting a majority of elections board seats.\nWriting for the majority in the 4-3 decision in January, Associate Justice Sam Ervin IV said provisions concerning board membership and appointments \u201ctaken in context with the other provisions of that legislation, impermissibly interfere with the governor\u2019s ability to faithfully execute the laws\u201d and are unconstitutional.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the GOP\u2019s legal win will be permanent. The tweaks the legislature made to the board membership don\u2019t take effect until after March 15 because Cooper announced last month he wouldn\u2019t sign the bill into law \u2013 meaning a 30-day delay. The alterations call for a nine-member board appointed by Cooper and composed of four Democrats, four Republicans and one person from neither major party.\nCooper\u2019s lawyers could appeal the trial judges\u2019 decision to the state Supreme Court. And the governor already has signaled that he will sue again over the altered law, even though it creates the ninth member and gives Cooper the power to remove any member at this pleasure. Cooper has said the board changes, when taken as a whole, eroded his authority to carry out election laws and protect voting rights.\nSenate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore said they were pleased the panel preserved a bipartisan combined board they have argued will lead to better administration of elections.\n\u201cWe have addressed the court\u2019s concerns about the board\u2019s membership in a bill Gov. Cooper has already promised to allow to become law, and we once again encourage him to abandon taxpayer-funded and self-serving lawsuits,\u201d Berger and Moore said in a release.\nLegislators have tried three times to create a combined board. The first combined board approved in late 2016 already had been struck down by the same three judges who ruled Monday \u2013 Superior Court Judges Jesse Caldwell, Todd Burke and Jeffery Foster. That caused legislators to pass a second version in April that was the subject of the recent rulings.\nCooper spokesman Ford Porter said the administration has confidence the third \u201cwill meet the same fate\u201d and get struck down.\nThe litigation has meant the elections board has been vacant since last June. Staff members have been performing administrative duties, and contested elections last fall were settled in court."}

Cohen said he made the payments at Trump\u2019s direction.\nThe Cohen case is unlikely to lead to any legal consequences for Trump while he is in office, experts say, although it could prompt calls for his impeachment should Democrats take the House in November.\nDershowitz said Sunday that \u201cit would be great\u201d to have Democrats in charge on Capitol Hill so that they can conduct investigations into Trump\u2019s actions.\nBut he continued to play down Trump\u2019s failure to report the hush money, arguing that the person at fault for the campaign finance violation would be the campaign\u2019s treasurer, not the candidate.\nHe also offered four broader points of advice for Trump.\n\u201cLook, my advice to the president \u2014 I never gave it to him privately because I\u2019m not his lawyer, but on television \u2014 is: Don\u2019t fire, don\u2019t pardon, don\u2019t tweet and don\u2019t testify.

Giuliani. Gonzales said that while Trump is entitled to speak his mind, his apparent sympathy for Manafort puts him at odds with his own Justice Department.\n\u201cThey had a very successful conviction of Paul Manafort. And to have the president then, you know, speak so well of Paul Manafort was somewhat unusual,\u201d Gonzales said.\nHe added that it might be helpful for Trump to at least answer written questions from Mueller in the Russia probe, even if he declines to provide oral testimony.\n\u201cI think perhaps it may ease, in the minds of certain members of the American public, the president\u2019s involvement, the president\u2019s knowledge about Russian involvement\u201d in the 2016 presidential election, Gonzales said."}

With a goal to assemble and deliver 50 WARM houses this season, Project WARM is funded solely through donations and built by Friends For Life volunteers and staff.\nProject WARM provides housing to felines that have never had contact with humans or contact with humans has diminished over time. These animals survive outdoors and most likely will never become a lap cat or enjoy living inside.\nThe WARM houses are constructed out of sturdy materials able to withstand the elements and provide a temperate place for the cat to rest. The houses, dark in color, blend with their surroundings as to not be obtrusive to near-by human neighbors. They are filled with straw and foam that is resistant to wetness while a 6-inch wide opening fits a cat, keeping larger wild animals at bay.\nFriends For Life\u2019s main goals in Project WARM are to provide shelter for the untamed cats of Houston where the temperature can reach the low 40s and to strengthen the relationship between the community and these animals.\nA common misconception is that helping ferals contributes to their quantity. Cats have been living outside among humans for thousands of years. Animal control\u2019s traditional approach for feral cats, catching and killing, is cruel and does not produce a desired result. Cats choose to reside in a location for two reasons: there is a food source and shelter. Because of a phenomenon called the vacuum effect, when cats are removed from a location, survivors of the catch and kill effort and new cats that have moved in breed to capacity.\nTrap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the humane, effective approach for feral cats. Through TNR, feral cats are humanely trapped, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and ear tipped (the universal symbol of a neutered and vaccinated cat), and then returned to their outdoor home stabilizing the population. TNR improves the relationship between the cats and the community and the behaviors associated with mating stop and the feral cats live full, healthy lives outdoors.\nWith a $20 donation, one WARM house can be built. Donators can purchase a house for a feral colony they know of or contribute to the project. WARM houses are available at Friends For Life located at 107 E. 22nd St. Donations are accepted at the shelter and online by visiting nokill1.org.\nFriends For Life, Houston\u2019s fastest growing No Kill animal adoption and rescue organization, is dedicated to offering No Kill solutions to the animals of Houston and the people who want to help them. Programs include rescue, rehabilitation, adoption, humane education and animal food/supply support.

His opening solo on tenor saxophone was large in scope and gauzy in tone, a sure indication that romantic melody-making was in the offing.\nThe extraordinary slowness of Coltrane\u2019s vibrato underscored the point, but this was no mere throwback to the era of tenor eminences Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins.

The pair spends their time skiing the mountains in winter and traveling the world in spring.\nEven for coffee shop owners, the first cup of joe in the morning is the best part of the day.\nDave and Suzie VerSchure have owned Abbey\u2019s Coffee in Frisco for the last 21 years. Aside from his daily shot of caffeine, Dave said the best thing about the shop is being his own boss. But for Suzie, it\u2019s the people.\nThe pair moved to Summit County from Boulder after Dave\u2019s father expressed an interest in opening a coffee shop after he retired. The VerSchures opened the business two months after moving in 1996, naming it after their rescue dog, Abbey, who was around a year-and-a-half old at the time.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to name it after us. We love dogs. That\u2019s our big passion. So she just seemed to be the natural choice,\u201d Suzie said.\nThe pair are avid animal lovers, with spots on the patio outside Abbey\u2019s for customers to keep their dogs. Suzie has been on the board of League for Animals and People of the Summit since 1999.\nAlthough Abbey has since passed away, the couple continues to work with animals. They now have two rescues named Hugo and Ripley.\nSuzie said that one of the benefits of being in Summit is that the shelter here brings stray animals in from other areas, because Summit residents are so pet friendly.\nSuzie and Dave met in Steamboat Springs in the late \u201980s. Suzie said that Dave was the first person she met that was from Colorado. The two, who were neighbors, bonded over a shared hobby \u2014 reading.\n\u201cHer roommate said \u2018Suzie, you\u2019ve got to meet the boy next door, he reads books,\u2019\u201d said Dave.\nDave reads tomes on history, while Suzie opts for fiction and books about travel, another passion.\nThe VerSchures consider themselves to be mountain people. Dave was born in Aspen, and wanted to quickly return to the mountains after moving away from Steamboat in 1995. Suzie, on the other hand, grew up living around the globe with her family. Like most people in Summit, they enjoy skiing and being outside with their dogs in the snow. But a sense of wanderlust pulls the couple away for trips around the world. During the spring, when Summit is a little quieter, the couple tries to escape to Europe.\nItaly is their favorite destination. Since they primarily travel in spring, it\u2019s too early for hiking in the Dolomites and too late for skiing. Instead, the pair usually drives around the country seeing the sites.\nThe couple also enjoys diving as a warmer pastime. They have ventured off to Jamaica, Roat\u00e1n in Honduras and Mexico to explore the depths of the ocean. The couple is hoping that their next diving trip will be over to Belize."}

{"idx": "24840", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: By Ross Elliott - posted Friday, 16 October 2015 Sign Up for free e-mail updates!\nMuch is being made of opportunities for retirement living and aged care due to our ageing population. For those who retire with a healthy balance sheet there are increasing choices within a fast evolving 'for profit' industry. But the reality for a majority will be ongoing dependence on the aged pension and insufficient government or non-profit places to accommodate them.\nThe basics of our ageing population are easy enough to understand. First, there will be more of them \u2013 with Australians aged 65 plus the fastest growing cohort in coming years, rising from 14% of the population now to around one in five Australians by 2033. In terms of actual numbers, the current estimate of around 3.5 million Australians aged 65 plus will rise to around 6.3 million in the next 20 years \u2013 an increase of around 2.8 million people. I will be one of them.\nFor the aged care and retirement living industry, this is a future demand profile virtually immune from market cycles. You can't stop people aging, and as we live longer, there will be more people ageing than ever before. Life expectancy in 1970 was 70 years of age. It's now 82, and still climbing. If you are currently aged 65, you can (on average) expect to live another 19 years for males, and 22 years for females, because ironically the longer you live the greater your life expectancy becomes.\nIn response, sections of the retirement living and aged care industry are transforming rapidly. What was once a cottage industry run mostly by charitable, religious or non-profit groups, is rapidly evolving into a very professional industry run by private or publicly listed businesses, looking for greenfield expansion, acquisition or redevelopment opportunities to grow portfolios and improve operational efficiencies. Many of these businesses are well positioned for ongoing growth in scale and profits and will be cheered on as market darlings by investors and an increasing number of people reliant on their growth for work. Including me, hopefully.\nAt the same time it is easy to lose sight of a more sobering market reality. Expansion in the aged care and retirement living industry is being led by businesses who are catering in the main for the upscale end of the market. In other words, old people with money. A significant proportion (and perhaps a majority) of old people won't have the funds needed to enter private retirement living or aged care, or if they do, their funds might be depleted because they live longer than they budgeted for. Don't get squeamish on me at this point, because ageing is all about economics and budgets.\nSo here are some financial angles on the ageing demographic which reveal a worrying future policy landscape for those not at the premium end of the retiree market.\nToday, roughly one in four people aged 65 and over are either renting their own home, or still paying off a mortgage. The proportion who own their own home outright is falling, and based on falling rates of home ownership amongst Australia's current generation of 30 somethings, the proportion who own their own home by say 2050 will be significantly less.\nThen there is superannuation. The average current super balance of someone aged 60 plus and not yet retired is just $95,000. The proportion of people aged 65 and over who have no superannuation at all is around 65%. Yes, this is changing as more superannuants retire, but superannuation"}
{"idx": "24841", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Experts say there are multiple reasons for the shortfall, such as residents here moving more often, bureaucratic hurdles and uncompetitive statewide contests that fail to capture the public\u2019s attention. Whatever the causes, the result is the same: an electorate that is whiter, older and wealthier than the state as a whole and a large share of the population disengaged from the laws and representatives chosen in its name.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a particularly big problem \u2013 there\u2019s a big difference between people who vote and the people who don\u2019t vote in California,\u201d said Mark Baldassare, president of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.\nGetting people to sign up to vote once relied on expensive registration drives and stacks of paper. Since September 2012, though, people can sign up online. And advocates point to other possible strategies to raise registration rates, such as allowing people to register on Election Day, allowing high school students under age 18 to pre-register, and joining a growing multistate network that quickly re-registers people who move. None of those exist in California.\nThe office of Secretary of State Debra Bowen, who is leaving office this year because of term limits, notes that the state\u2019s official registration rate of 73.2 percent of 23.2 million people eligible is better than the 69.9 percent when she took office after the 2006 election. Bowen has worked to increase voter sign-ups with online registration and other efforts, spokeswoman Shannan Velayas said.\nYet some experts, such as Pew, suspect that the registration total compiled by Bowen\u2019s office includes thousands of people who have died or moved. U.S. census data after the November 2012 election shows more than 8 million eligible-but-unregistered residents in California, an amount larger than all but 13 states and nearly 2 million more than Bowen\u2019s office counts.\nRegistration rates are even lower for Latinos, Asians and young people in California. Less than 57 percent of Latino residents eligible to vote were registered in November 2012, according to census data. The rate was 58 percent for Asians. Among voters 18 to 23, the rate was 60 percent, according to the California Civic Engagement Project at UC Davis.\n\u201cSome people might say that\u2019s the fault of those groups. Certainly there\u2019s always apathy,\u201d said Mindy Romero, the center\u2019s director. A main reason, she said, is that Latino, Asian and young residents make up a disproportionate share of lower-income residents. And research shows that lower-income residents have lower registration and turnout rates, she said.\nExperts also point a finger at political campaigns, which tend to focus attention and money on voters most likely to show up. Fewer resources go into mobilizing voters without a track record. That creates a \u201cself-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d said Kim Alexander of the California Voter Foundation.\n\u201cPeople highly engaged get lots of material, phone calls and people knocking on their doors. People who are not registered or (have) not voted lately, no one\u2019s knocking on their door,\u201d she said.\nThere are exceptions. In November 2012, after a major push by President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, students and other pro-Obama young people turned out in large numbers and made up the same share of the national vote as in 2008.

Desperately needing help in a war against an intergalactic warlord, the aliens bring the actors aboard their spaceship and send them on their mission. Allen\u2019s, Weaver\u2019s and Rickman\u2019s characters despise their association with \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d and wish audiences would recognize them for their larger body of work, but they are forced to embrace their roles in order to defeat the villain.\nRickman demonstrates some strong comedic sensibilities as Alexander Dane, a pretentious Shakespearean actor who loathes his Spock-esque role and his most famous line: \u201cBy Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d In a film full of laughs, Rickman gets some of the best.\nThe climax of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d saga focuses on the final struggle between its titular character (Daniel Radcliffe) and the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), but the most memorable part of the film revolves around the tragic Severus Snape \u2014 Alan Rickman\u2019s most memorable role.

Lowe&apos;s comps were up 7.3% and 7.9%, respectively.\nGo big or go homeThose muscular results by Big Orange allowed it to shower shareholders with cash in the form of the stock buyback plan and the dividend hike.\nIt&apos;s hard to argue with its capital allocation decisions. Over the past five years, Home Depot&apos;s stock has appreciated by nearly 270%, suggesting it&apos;s been a good steward of shareholder resources and using them appropriately.\nHousing&apos;s foundation still shakyWhile the rebound from the depths of the recession is noteworthy because it indicates housing&apos;s continued improvement should further enhance Home Depot&apos;s results, not everything was unicorns and rainbows for the big-box retailer.\nThe housing market is seen as generally being in a better place, but it&apos;s a very uneven recovery. Sales of existing homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.82 million in January, a 4.9% decline from a year ago and the lowest level since last April. Reuters reports housing activity has been sluggish since the middle of 2013 because of tight inventories and rising rates, which have put off first-time home buyers, meaning the situation might not improve until the back half of this year.\nDuring the call with analysts, Home Depot also mentioned its better performance may have actuallybeen due to the more robust activity in housing in 2013. It referenced a study that showed there could be as much as a 12-month lag between housing&apos;s results and when it shows up elsewhere. If true, that could make the coming year a challenging one for the big-box store.\nHome Depot also noted that its guidance didn&apos;t take into account any costs related to its customer credit data breach.\nWhile much of Home Depot&apos;s success has been a result of housing&apos;s recovery, it&apos;s future depends on it continuing to heal.

The Aug. 30 event marks the last time MTV veteran Van Toffler, who officially exited as president of the network in April, toplines the telecast. It won't be a quiet exit, either, seeing how Miley Cyrus is set to host (so far, only The Weeknd is confirmed to be performing). MTV's hope: Besides upping viewership from a disappointing 8.3 million in 2014 (down 18 percent from 2013), to connect with VMAs of years past, if not the 2013 show necessarily (foam finger, anyone?), then the 2011 edition that featured a pregnant Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga in drag and Adele in all her pre-Grammy-sweeping glory.\nWhat has Van Toffler brought to the show, and how do you say goodbye?\nHe's the heart and soul of this show. We're on calls and meetings every week, and he really inspires [everyone]. In terms of my part, I wouldn't be doing this show if it wasn't for Van. He was kind enough to allow me to pitch creative in 2007, and I had this crazy idea of taking over a hotel in Las Vegas. He loved it. Van, in a nutshell, wants to go on crazy adventures. So he will be missed. Every artist in the room would say that.\nHaving Miley Cyrus host seems a risky affair on live TV. How will the network censors deal with her antics?\nMiley knows how far she can push things and where it would cross the line. [Whether] it's language or concepts for a pre-tape that go too far, she's the first to say, \"You probably won't let me do that.\" To this point, there hasn't been anything where you'd need to have a finger on a button ready to press it ... She just likes to have fun, and I think it's going to carry through the whole show. And, of course, she will throw in some surprises.\nI don't see this as Miley taking the stage and we're all concerned about what she's going to say. I think the opposite: I'm excited for what she'll say and do as host. Miley Cyrus is the epitome of the VMAs.\nHow will you take advantage of the smaller setting that the 7,100-capacity Microsoft Theater [formerly the Nokia Theatre] offers?\nIt was important for us to get back into that room where we were in 2011 when we had Beyonc\u00e9 with the baby bump or Gaga as Jo Calderone or Adele's performance, when she was solo on the piano and just nailed it. We can do those kinds of moments when the room is not overwhelming in terms of scope and scale. We've made an effort to create an environment where we can go very intimate and where the audience can be very close to the action.

Among his patients was the late Wallace Miller Sr., an attorney and the mayor of Macon in 1926-27.\nIn the mid-1960s, Miller began sharing some of his peonies with Jones and his wife, Dorothy, who had a rose garden. Peonies were uncharted territory for Jones.\nThere now are more than 6,500 varieties. Even the name peonies can be spelled more than one way. Some can live for more than 100 years.\nJones convinced Dorothy to let him plant a half-dozen peonies around the periphery of the garden.

He then became belligerent and punched the officer in the forehead, said Abdulahad, who was in full uniform at the time.\nA scuffle ensued as Abdulahad tried to place Walters in handcuffs, causing the suspect to fall to the ground, the report states.

Walters said he hasn\u2019t talked to police because he was advised not to do so without legal counsel.\nA Bulldogs employee told TheAJC there are video cameras on the bar\u2019s back patio, but it\u2019s unclear whether they would\u2019ve captured the fracas.\nAPD\u2019s internal affairs division was made aware of the incident by Abdulahad last October, who told them he used force to conduct a \u201clawful arrest,\u201d Pickard said. The photos of Walters\u2019 injuries were posted online shortly thereafter and investigators reached out to the person who uploaded them but \u201cthe response was negative,\u201d according to Pickard.\nIt\u2019s uncertain how this incident might impact the investigation into Phillips\u2019 death in January.

Those in south Lafourche argue that more people are moving to communities like Galliano for economic opportunities.\nThe answer, according to the U.S. Census, is that they're all correct.\nThe north end of the parish has seen a 5 percent increase over the past 13 years, in large part because Chackbay's population is booming. South Lafourche's population has increased by 4 percent with steady population increases in Galliano, Larose and Cut Off.\nThe entire parish has seen a 7 percent increase since 2000.\nThe migration from lower Lafourche up the bayou is \"subconscious,\" Parish President Charlotte Randolph said.\n\"It's been happening for many years. Storms chase people farther up the coast, and now they're seeing an opportunity to stay in Lafourche and be somewhat protected from concerns in the past,\" she said.\nCouncilman Aaron Caillouet, who represents Thibodaux and neighborhoods north of the city, said he's seen a population increase in the northern end, though he doesn't believe people are running away from the south part of the parish.\n\"It's not that big of an effect,\" he said.\nThere's a smaller risk of flooding in north Lafourche, Caillouet maintains. It's farther from the Gulf of Mexico and the land is at a higher elevation.\nCaillouet says there is migration from south to north, but it's not significant.\n\"It's no reason for concern yet. The north Lafourche area might also be in the Gulf in the future,\" he said of the threat posed by coastal erosion.\nChackbay, a small community between Thibodaux and Vacherie in St. James Parish, grew 29 percent over the past decade. Those who live in Chackbay cite good schools and low crime as reasons for the uptick in population.\n\"The school systems are the best here,\" said Chackbay resident Todd Tabor. \"Everybody knows everybody, and we all watch out for each other by all means. It keeps crime down that way.\"\nWith cheap natural gas prices fueling profits for chemical makers, about $10 billion of investment is projected to be spent on chemical plants along the Mississippi River and within an hour's commute of Thibodaux. That's drawing new and prospective employees to Chackbay, Randolph said.\nAbout 42,000 new jobs are expected to become available in the next six years, according to a report by the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center.\nNewcomers to the parish often move to south Lafourche to be near Port Fourchon and other economic opportunities, Randolph said. Though Nicholls State University and Thibodaux Regional Medical Center offer plenty of opportunities, the oil and gas industry in south Lafourche is the source of many local jobs.\nDaniel Lorraine agrees, citing conversations he has had with people who moved there from Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes. Lorraine is south Lafourche's longtime representative on the Parish Council.\n\"They came here after the hurricanes hit their area. They started mingling with the people, who were really friendly and treated them real nice, and they saw what the area has to offer,\" he said.\nLorraine said"}
{"idx": "24861", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It's Google versus Facebook in the fight for video dominance | City A.M.\nThere's a battle brewing online. In search of more views, users, and lucrative ad money, Facebook wants to take on Google and steal YouTube\u2019s crown as the dominant video platform.\nThe social media giant is fighting on two fronts. It launched its first assault last year with Facebook Watch, a platform effectively identical to YouTube, where creators could post videos and monetise them with ads. The platform was exclusive to US users, but it went global at the end of August.\nSecond, Instagram (which is owned by Facebook) launched IGTV in June this year. While users could previously post videos to their profiles, these were limited to one minute in length \u2013 with IGTV, videos can last up to one hour.\nIGTV\u2019s other novelty is that video is presented vertically, rather than the traditional landscape. That\u2019s a challenge for videographers, who are having to start from scratch with this new format, but it\u2019s ideal for users. And when IGTV launched, advertisers and content creators \u201cjumped at it like sharks\u201d, according to Rocio Galan, head of social media strategies at The Social Chain.\nBut success on the platform has been lacklustre so far. Social media influencer Nash Grier, who has nearly five million YouTube subscribers, posted a video to IGTV in late August. To date, it has only received about 32,000 views.\nSo why the push into video for Facebook in the first place? For a start, the aim is to lure users, especially younger ones, away from YouTube. Facebook has an ageing userbase, as the youth of today prefer other sites: a survey from the Pew Research Center found that 85 per cent of US teens said that they used the video platform, while just 51 per cent said they used Facebook.\nThe other reason is, of course, money. Smartphone video is the fastest growing format of online ad spend \u2013 up \u00a3476m in 2017 from the year before, an increase of 69 per cent, according to a report by the Internet Advertising Bureau.\n\u201cFacebook Watch\u2019s launch is further evidence of just how far companies are pushing live and on-demand video,\u201d says Josh Krichefski, chief executive at content agency MediaCom.\nIt\u2019s not just about user-generated content. Facebook Watch will enable the firm to challenge professional streaming services like Netflix. Facebook is reportedly willing to spend up to $1bn on original video content in order to compete with the established players, and draw in more users who want quality entertainment rather than just cute videos of cats.\nThe bigger Facebook Watch\u2019s userbase, the keener brands and advertisers will be to create video content for it. Brands absolutely love video content, because they see it as more intimate or informative than just a picture or a wall of text.\n\u201cVideo is definitely the future of content creation, because it allows brands to tell their story in a more personal and developed way than just someone staring at an image,\u201d adds Galan.\nBrands use images now because they can add shopping points to them \u2013 consumers can click on the advert, and will be taken to an online store to purchase it. But Galan predicts that soon there will be technology allowing shopping points to be placed into videos as well.\nWhat does all this mean for advertisers and content creators?\n\u201cThis is another development in what is an exciting time and future for media planning across video,\u201d says Hannah King, head of planning at Agenda21.\nHowever, she warns that Facebook Watch and IGTV"}

It gives him another start before the year\u2019s last major, next week\u2019s PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club outside St. Louis, and another chance to improve his standing in the chase for a berth on the U.S. Ryder Cup team.\nIt\u2019s a bittersweet return of sorts. The tournament moves to Memphis next year. Firestone, which has held a professional tournament every year since 1954, will instead host the Senior Players Championship on the PGA Tour Champions.\nWoods, 42, first competed at Firestone South in the 1997 NEC World Series of Golf, but his memories of the course date to years earlier, during his amateur days, when he and his late father, Earl, played the South and North Course during a visit to a family friend in Cleveland.\nWith his berth in the 73-man field, Woods likely is slated to compete five of the next six weeks and six times in an eight-week stretch, including the FedEx Cup playoffs, for which he hasn't qualified since 2013. That\u2019s a lot of golf for a man who underwent spinal fusion surgery last April.\nAnd, who knows, perhaps he\u2019ll have even more golf ahead if he qualifies for the U.S. Ryder Cup team or plays well enough in this busy stretch to warrant a captain's pick from Jim Furyk. It probably doesn\u2019t hurt his cause that he already is going to Paris as one of Furyk\u2019s vice captains.\nAnother word is evolving. \u201cThis entire year has been one that I've been evolving and I'm changing a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cGolf is very fluid, and I've been able to make change on the fly and they've worked.\nAll things being equal, this year has been darn impressive.\nFour top-10 finishes and eight in the top-25 in 12 starts, highlighted by his run at a 15th major title at the Open Championship. Woods briefly held the lead before his swing betrayed him while playing partner Francesco Molinari claimed the claret jug. Last week, the 14-time major winner chose to unwind and ameliorate his disappointment abroad, taking his two children to Switzerland.\n\u201cWe had a great time hiking, being up in the mountains and just enjoying each other\u2019s company,\u201d he said.\nHe also had time to reflect on the setback at Carnoustie.\nThe entire year has been full of positives.

Banks and other lenders who invested in financial technology (FinTech) got a jump on their competitors. This is not unlike what happened in the retail space once Amazon help make online shopping mainstream.\nAccording to a recent report by Kevin Wack in American Banker, many banks are paying \u201ca sizable price for failing to modernize their mortgage application processes in the internet age.\u201d Wack points to a new study of mortgage lending, Fintech, Regulatory Arbitrage, and the Rise of Shadow Banks, co-written by business school professors at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School and Stanford Graduate School of Business.\nThe researchers found that some banks find themselves trying to play catch-up to competitors that long ago allowed borrowers to apply for mortgages online. The institutions that have been slow to adopt online applications for mortgage lending are losing market share to their competitors. Meanwhile, non-bank lenders have grabbed a substantial piece of the market; so-called \u201cshadow banks\u201d lend money but don\u2019t use bank deposits to finance the transactions. They now write 38% of all home loans -- almost triple their share in 2007. Further, the shadow banks now originate three-fourths of all loans to low-income borrowers insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In fact, Quicken Loans, parent of online lender Rocket Mortgage, is now one of the three top mortgage originators in the nation.\nThe residential mortgage market has changed dramatically in the years following the financial crisis and great recession\u2026 Shadow bank lenders\u2019 market share among all residential mortgage lending has grown from 15% in 2007 to 38% in 2015.\nGrowth\u2026 has been most dramatic among the high-risk, low-creditworthiness FHA borrower segment, as well as among low-income and high-minority areas, making loans that traditional banks may be unable (to make because of their) highly monitored balance sheets.\nFinTech lenders, for which the origination process takes place nearly entirely online, have grown from roughly 4% market share in 2007 to 13% market share in 2015, and represent a significant fraction of shadow bank market share growth\u2026 The ease of online origination appears to allow FinTech lenders to charge higher rates, particularly among the lowest-risk, and presumably least price sensitive and most time sensitive borrowers.\nNon-bank lenders achieved tremendous growth because they took advantage of technology and the fact that traditional banks are more tightly regulated than they are. What is happening in mortgages is similar to what we have seen in small business lending during the past decade.\nRecently, Santander InnoVentures, a $200 million FinTech fund and division of the Santander Group, announced that it will invest in the U.K.-based firms Pixoneye and Curve, as well as the U.S.-based Gridspace, three companies in the artificial intelligence space in an effort to drive technological innovation on their finance platform.\nPixoneye bills itself as the only company that can profile customers by analyzing their mobile photo galleries on smart phones, tablets and other devices.

Focused densely within just a few dozen blocks around the MIT campus, nascent successes like Vertex stood shoulder to shoulder with more established companies that were only older by single-digit years. It was a community where everybody knew your name.\nTen years later, coming back to start Yumanity Therapeutics, I return to a different scene altogether: a sprawling technology city within a city, spilling over its own borders with labs stacked on top of labs, and avenues and streets bustling with the pulse of a newly formed mini-republic.\nLike someone who grew up in a suburb that overnight had become a metropolis, I could hardly recognize the house where I grew up or find my old favorite coffee shop amidst the gleam, glitter and steel of my new digs.\nNo surprise\u2014right? It was going to happen anyway, if we just watered the handful of companies that were already there and let the sunshine of launch successes do the rest. Somehow, that doesn\u2019t seem to be what happened. I think the boom was intentional\u2014planful almost\u2014and creatively designed with a longer-term vision. This was the dream-child of a governor faced with dim prospects for stimulating economic growth amidst the worst financial crisis in generations and a handful of biotech luminaries who had broader visions for the proper place of Boston and Cambridge in the pantheon of biotechnology history.\nWhile we have seen biotech grow primarily in geographic clusters, there was something different about the way this seedling was growing.\nOne thing will always ring true: great science and exceptional technology can come from anywhere. The established hubs\u2014Boston, San Francisco, New York, Raleigh-Durham, Seattle, and San Diego\u2014are all strong innovation clusters with a dynamism and centripetal force that combines science and business and results, time and time again, in powerful and meaningful medical and scientific breakthroughs.\nBut there\u2019s always been something different about the Cambridge area and San Francisco. Greater Boston and the Bay Area are premier innovation hubs and have always been leaders amongst peers. One is the birthplace of biotech and home of some of the greats\u2014Genentech and Gilead Sciences, to name a couple. The other has just the right mix of academia, intellect and a white-hot venture capital micro-economy.\nBut the Greater Boston area has become something even more: an \u201cuber something\u201d that is breathing new life into an already exciting and vibrant industry. The region boasts the highest concentration of life-science research workers in the U.S., making it a desirable home for incubators, startups and a host of big pharmaceutical companies. The energy is palpable with an access to talent that is unrivaled, whether you\u2019re having breakfast at Henrietta\u2019s Table or enjoying a coffee at Voltage (maybe my new favorite?).

The suit alleges that North, a former member of the Icarus Line, launched his mic stand through the air, coming down hard on LaVoie's head.\nNine Inch Nails' label, Interscope Records, could not be reached for comment.\nAccording to the suit, which also specifically names North as a defendant, the blow knocked LaVoie unconscious. He fell to the floor, the suit read, \"and was bleeding from a large laceration on the top of his head.\" LaVoie was treated at a nearby hospital.\nCourt papers suggest North \"intentionally, violently and without just cause or provocation ... attacked and assaulted [LaVoie] when he threw the microphone stand into the audience, striking [him] on the head and causing him serious pain and permanent injury.\" North, the suit contends, should have realized tossing the stand into the crowd would wind up hurting someone.\nNine Inch Nails, according to the suit, are liable for LaVoie's injuries, in part, because the band continues \"to employ [North] when Nine Inch Nails knew or should have known that [North] had a history of violent, assaultive and criminal behavior.\"\nBy permitting North to perform at the show, the band, the suit read, \"knew or should have known that such permission would probably result in injury to [LaVoie].\" In addition, the suit claims the band failed to properly supervise the guitarist, \"so as to prevent him from causing serious bodily injury to innocent third persons.\"\nLaVoie is also seeking compensation for his medical expenses and lost wages, as well as any future income he might lose because of his injuries. The suit cites a 2002 incident in which North stole \"Stevie Ray Vaughan's guitar ... by smashing the protective case with a microphone stand\" at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas (see \"Long Lines For Clinic, Lynch Mob For Icarus Line At SXSW\"). It also claims that, during a concert back in 2004 with the Icarus Line, North \"physically beat and inflicted bodily injury on a fan who was in attendance\" and that these two incidents indicate \"an intentional disregard of [LaVoie's] rights.\""}

Hipstamatic was cool and had great filters, but it was hard to share your photos. Facebook was the king of social networking, but its iPhone app didn\u2019t have a great photo-sharing feature. Mike and Kevin saw an opportunity to slip in between Hipstamatic and Facebook, by developing an easy-to-use app that made social photo-sharing simple.

Tony Dokoupil on how the tragedy could affect their work\u2014and change health care for all.\nCould Jared Loughner's killing spree in Arizona have been prevented? The speculation\u2014by now a familiar postscript to blood-soaked gun rampages\u2014began immediately after the first shot, raising some familiar issues (gun control, security), as well as some newer ones (political rhetoric, Sarah Palin.) But the incident also tapped into a fierce and ongoing argument amongst psychiatrists about how to best help people like Loughner, who experts say almost certainly suffers from schizophrenia, before they turn on themselves\u2014or others.\nAt the center of the debate is the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders\u2014a.k.a. psychiatry's bible\u2014now being revised for the first time in a decade. Inclusion or exclusion in the tome is no picayune affair. With its evolving list of illnesses, the DSM shapes the way people talk about, recognize, and respond to mental illness, and every new edition shakes up the field by helping to determine the line between normal and not\u2014as well as when patients should receive treatment, and what that treatment should look like. Since insurance companies often don't reimburse treatment for non-DSM disorders, inclusion is a common prerequisite for new drug development, large-scale clinical trials, and funding for ambitious research.\nAll of which helps explain why the first draft of the new DSM has inspired an epic fight over the inclusion of \"psychosis risk syndrome\" (PRS), a term for the earliest stage of schizophrenia, when the demons of full-blown insanity are just starting to bite. On one side are psychiatrists who oppose PRS because it risks misdiagnosing, treating, and stigmatizing people who may never develop schizophrenia. On the other are those who see it as the best hope for preventing true madness. While doctors have dozens of labels for flagrant insanity, there are virtually none for the stages preceding that first psychotic break\u2014a period when a patient's sense of reality is still stronger than their hallucinations and delusions. If diagnosed and treated then, experts say, it might be possible to delay or entirely avert the disease.\nIn Arizona, that means \"the whole ensuing nightmare could have been prevented,\" says Yale psychiatrist Thomas McGlashan, who was the first American to open a clinic for patients in a pre-psychotic state, \"had [Loughner] been evaluated earlier for the risk syndrome.\" Many of his peers\u2014including Columbia University psychiatrist Jeffrey Lieberman and William Carpenter, head of the DSM work group that's evaluating PRS\u2014agree that an early diagnosis would, as Carpenter put it, \"increase the likelihood that someone like Loughner would get treatment.\" The University of Maryland professor points to the case of John Hinckley Jr., Ronald Reagan's would-be assassin, whose parents later described how they tried (and failed) to find a doctor to diagnose their novel- and movie-haunted son before he tried to kill the president in 1981.

Her son, who recently attempted suicide in another city, was sent home from hospital with no follow-up. Now, with a doctor they had never met before, they were trying to get help. Dr. Cookson asked a few questions about his current treatment, learned of a new antidepressant that the mother said seemed to be working.\nWith no history of care, Dr. Cookson had no way to know for sure. She advised him to make sure he told his mom if he had suicidal thoughts again and wrote a referral to see a psychiatrist, though even an urgent request would take weeks. Other than that, she had little to offer. They had no coverage for psychotherapy, which ideally, she would have prescribed. Since the young man was a walk-in patient, there is no guarantee she will see him again. \u201cI want to be able to give them the care they deserve, and I know will benefit him, and I have no way of arranging that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty helpless feeling.\u201d And one to which many family doctors, struggling to help mentally ill patients, can attest.\nAfter months of research, and as detailed in our Open Minds series, The Globe and Mail identified some of the top evidence-based approaches to building a mental-health system that will work for Canadians. These are changes that would move the country beyond its patchwork, fragmented mental-health system in which the care patients receive is too often determined by what they can afford, or where they live, or what they are savvy enough to cobble together on their own. These initiatives abide by the principals of Medicare and good science, and treat the disorders of the mind as diligently as the diseases of the body.\nOne in five Canadians will be affected by mental illness in their lifetimes. The cost to the country\u2019s economic is staggering: $50-billion a year in health care and social services, lost productivity and decreased quality of life, estimates the Mental Health Commission of Canada. The personal costs are more devastating \u2013 unemployment, family breakup, suicide.\nCanadians who seek help for a mental illness will most often be prescribed medication, even though research shows that psychotherapy works just as well, if not better, for the most common illnesses (depression and anxiety) and does a better job at preventing relapse. According to a 2012 Statistics Canada study, while 91 per cent of Canadians were prescribed the medication they sought, only 65 per cent received the therapy they felt they needed. Access to evidence-based psychotherapy, which experts say should be the front-line medical treatment, is limited and wait lists are long.\nNo provinces cover therapy delivered in private practice by a psychologist, social worker or psychotherapist, creating a two-tier system which means families without coverage through work \u2013 those more likely to be low-income \u2013 often either pay out of pocket or go without, or, if they are lucky, rely on a non-profit group working to fill a gaping hole in a flawed health-care system. Even Canadians with coverage, rarely have enough for a proper dose that meets treatment guidelines. This kind of inconsistent, unequal and scientifically flawed approach to care would be untenable for diabetes, cancer or heart disease. Yet it persists for some of the most debilitating illnesses suffered by Canadians.\n\u201cClearly this is the biggest gap we have, and the one that most needs to be fixed,\u201d says psychiatrist Elliot Goldner, director of the"}

Martin O'Malley is proposing a plan to confront global warming through a state carbon cap \u2014 the generic words for carbon tax.\nNo doubt the tax will add 5 cents to 10 cents per gallon on gasoline, diesel, and home heating oil. The purpose of O'Malley's face-to-face meeting with the issue is to deal with the vulnerability of Maryland's 3,000 miles of shoreline that may suffer from a rise in sea level caused by global warming.\nGlobal warming activists have been warning of a 13-foot to 20-foot rise in sea level by the year 2050, caused by the melting of the great polar ice cap. The Democrat governor will be backing a bill that would \"set the nation's toughest limits on carbon emissions, a 90 percent drop from 2006 levels by 2050 with a 25 percent drop in carbon emissions by 2020.\"\nThe legislation the governor backs calls for the diversion of a $50 million Chesapeake Bay Fund, an energy efficiency measure and a reform to state zoning laws that apply to development near waterways. The governor wants to provide goodies for everyone.\nThinking realistically, the column of air that towers over Maryland for some 13 miles aloft is not static. The body of atmosphere is constantly moving from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the atmosphere that is Maryland's today is someone else's atmosphere tomorrow.\nIn addition, Maryland's atmosphere tomorrow was yesterday's atmosphere in Ohio or states to the west. Unless all states cooperate in the 25 percent to 90 percent reduction in CO2, Maryland's efforts will prove to be futile and the tax burden required to benefit all Marylanders will be for naught.\nThe rising sea levels of 13 feet to 20 feet that O'Malley fears when the great polar ice cap melts are a myth.\nThe great polar ice cap consists of 15 feet of ice frozen at sea level on the Arctic Ocean. This writer has been there and stood at precisely 90 degrees north latitude.\nSince the ice froze at sea level, it will melt to sea level. It physically cannot rise above sea level any more than a glass filled with ice will overflow when the ice melts. Claims of drastic rises in sea levels are nothing more than envirocrat lies.\nFurthermore, carbon dioxide has never been proven to be a hazard to human habitation on earth. In fact, CO2 is the giver of all life on the planet. It is the only substance on earth that can harness the energy of the sun and by the process of photosynthesis create matter in the form of vegetation on which all life subsists.\nThere is no sound scientific evidence that increases in CO2, even a doubling of CO2, would adversely affect human beings.

(The only equivalently large FAS priority is its $600-million faculty-related target for endowed chairs, graduate-student fellowships, research support, and related purposes.) In acknowledgment, the College financial-aid office will be renamed the Griffin Financial Aid Office, led by the Griffin Director of Financial Aid.\nThree intersecting factors explain why that is so.\neliminating home equity and retirement savings in calculating aid.\nIn retrospect, the timing of that considerable enrichment of aid was fateful: it came during a period of strong returns on the endowment (its value peaked at $36.9 billion as of June 30, 2008)\u2014only to be succeeded, 10 months later by the financial-market collapse, the resulting $11-billion decline in the endowment, and ensuing budget cuts.\nRising need. Under the liberalized financial-aid formulas, the number of students qualifying for aid, and the size of their grants, rose. The recession put many more families\u2019 incomes under great pressure. And of course the annual bill for tuition, room, and board increased annually\u2014enlarging the size of the required aid package. For students entering the College in the fall of 2004, when HFAI began, the term bill was $39,880; this academic year, it is $56,407\u2014a compound annual growth rate of about 4 percent.\nThe resource squeeze. According to College data, Harvard\u2019s budget for undergraduate financial aid has increased by 88 percent since 2007, and today, 60 percent of undergraduates receive financial aid. Given the increase in spending and the decrease in the value of the endowment (and two years of resulting reduced distributions for operating expenses, the faculty\u2019s principal source of revenue), FAS found itself in a financially uncomfortable position as it had to fund the aid budget\u2014never \u201cput on the table,\u201d in Smith\u2019s words\u2014by drawing more on its unrestricted funds.\nThus the faculty-wide significance of Griffin\u2019s scholarship gift and challenge fund.\nBy itself, Griffin\u2019s gift to the College may in fact be the largest single gift in Harvard history, period.

Even though the study urged a cautious interpretation of its findings, it prompted a wave of posts online about the dangers of drinking milk.\n\"I said, &apos;That&apos;s enough.&apos; We can&apos;t have these headlines that &apos;Milk Can Kill You&apos; and not stand up for the truth,\" Kadison said in a phone interview.\nOn Tuesday, the \"Get Real\" social media campaign will be announced at a dairy industry gathering in Boca Raton, Florida in conjunction with the National Dairy Council and Dairy Management Inc., which represent dairy farmers. The campaign is intended to drown out milk&apos;s detractors with positive posts about the nutritional benefits of milk on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere. Milk brands, their employees and others in the industry will post the messages and direct people to a website where they can get more information.\nThe campaign comes as milk&apos;s dominance in American homes continues to wane as beverage options proliferate. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, people drank an average of 14.5 gallons of milk a year in 2012. That&apos;s down 33 percent from the 21.8 gallons a year in 1970.\nOne factor chipping away at milk&apos;s dominance is the growth of non-dairy alternatives. While soy milk&apos;s popularity has faded, retail sales for almond milk are estimated to be up 39 percent last year, according to Virginia Lee, a packaged food analyst with market researcher Euromonitor International.\nBut milk&apos;s wholesome image is nevertheless being muddied by diet trends and divergent attitudes about nutrition. Many who follow the popular Paleo diet, for instance, shun dairy because people didn&apos;t drink it during the Stone Age.\nAnimal welfare groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are also a thorn in the milk industry&apos;s side. On its website, PETA notes that \"no species drinks milk beyond infancy or drinks the milk of another species\" and details the cruel conditions dairy cows are often subject to.\nThat&apos;s one of the reasons Valentin Vornicu, a 31-year-old resident of San Diego, California, said he stays away from milk.

{"idx": "24917", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Bank of America\u2019s management team plans to buy back even more stock than it originally planned.\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) has been one of the best-performing stocks in an impressive financial sector over the past couple of years. The stock has risen by more than 38% over the past year and is up a staggering 163% since its February 2016 lows, handily beating the performance of the S&P 500 and the overall financial sector.\nAfter such a remarkable run, it's only natural to wonder whether Bank of America's stock could be getting a bit expensive. However, there's a solid case to be made that the gains are well justified, and the bank's management recently announced a move that indicates that they still think the stock is cheap. After an already-massive buyback announcement earlier this year, Bank of America is planning to spend billions more to buy back its own stock.\nBank of America's stock has soared, but that doesn't mean that it's necessarily expensive. In fact, I would argue the exact opposite.\nFor starters, there have been several industrywide catalysts that have caused bank stocks as a group to be among the top performers in the market. The Federal Reserve has started to raise interest rates, and is widely expected to continue doing so. This has resulted in expanded profit margins for banks, and could lead to billions in additional profit over the next few years if rates continue to climb.\nIn addition, the banking industry could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lower corporate tax rate, and of looser banking regulations. Some expectation of this is certainly priced into the stock at this point, but these could still be positive catalysts once they're official.\nFinally, Bank of America has been one of the most impressive turnaround stories in the post-financial-crisis banking industry. The bank's income continues to rise, asset quality continues to improve, and the company has done an excellent job of cutting expenses, embracing new banking technologies, and running a much more efficient operation.\nBank of America already had implemented one of the largest buyback plans in the industry earlier this year. The bank had announced that as part of its approved capital plan, it would repurchase $12 billion worth of its common stock between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018. This is more than double the previous year's buyback authorization, and came in addition to a big dividend increase, and is in addition to the $0.9 billion in repurchases the company plans to make to offset its equity-based compensation during that period.\nRecently, the bank announced that it was increasing its buyback by an additional $5 billion, meaning that Bank of America plans to buy back a total of $17 billion in stock by June 30, 2018.\nThis increase has already been approved by the Federal Reserve, and is a result of the increased amount of capital the bank has after Berkshire Hathaway exercised its warrants and became the bank's largest shareholder, as well as from the sale of its non-U.S. credit card business earlier in 2017.\nGenerally, a company buys back stock when it feels that it is the most compelling way to return capital to shareholders. Bank of America's management has said that it feels its stock is an attractive long-term value, even at 2017's higher share prices, and that it plans to emphasize buybacks for the foreseeable future. With this latest move, the bank's management is putting its"}

(AP) \u2014 Money and memorabilia from Johnny Cash's family and friends have helped historians restore a significant part of the Historic Dyess Colony, a government collective built to pull Depression-era families out of poverty.\nThe country music icon's boyhood home, along with the colony's former headquarters, will open Saturday to reflect everyday life in a northeast Arkansas community built on once-sunken land.\n\"Restoring the Dyess Colony Administration Building, and even saving at least one of the typical colony houses, would have been a worthwhile project, even without the Johnny Cash connection,\" said Ruth Hawkins , the executive director of the Heritage Sites program at Arkansas State University.\nBefore he was the Man in Black, he was J.R. Cash , a son of Kingsland, Arkansas, farmers who successfully applied to take part in a 1930s Works Progress Administration experiment. The federal government brought in 487 families and gave them land and a mule.\n\"This was a practice in socialism,\" said Roscoe Phillips , who was born at Dyess 77 years ago. \"They took people who had nothing and gave us something. It wouldn't happen today.\"\nA restored five-room house northwest of town holds items that belonged to the singer's parents \u2014 a shaving mug in the bathroom and an upright piano atop red linoleum in the living room. J.R. shared a bedroom at the front of the house with three siblings. Although there was a toilet and bathtub, the home never had running water. Electrical service arrived in 1945.\nAt the museum back in town, Cash's 1950 Dyess High School yearbook, given to his daughter Rosanne in 2000, rests in a special wing dedicated to the singer and his family.\n\"It's been one of my most prized possessions. It's yours. Merry Christmas,\" Cash wrote to Rosanne on personal stationery with \"Johnny Cash\" scratched out and \"Dad\" written in.\nWithout Cash's fame, it'd be a lot tougher to save places like the Dyess Colony, one of nearly 100 proposed resettlement sites nationwide. Arkansas State used the same principle in 1999 when it restored Ernest Hemingway's writing studio in Piggott, 50 miles north. He worked there while married to Pauline Pfeiffer , the daughter of a prominent family.\nThe government cleared 2 acres to put up a house, a barn, a chicken coop and outhouse, then it was up to residents to clear the rest of the land, grow a crop and begin paying on a mortgage. Cash's father Ray signed his contract in February 1938 \u2014 for $2,183.60.\nStories about hard times here landed in some of Cash's songs and also Rosanne Cash's \"The Sunken Lands.\"\n\"I particularly had my grandmother Carrie Cash in mind all through the restoration process, and while writing 'The Sunken Lands,' about her and this very area,\" Rosanne Cash wrote. \"I wanted my children to know their lineage and that their great-grandparents worked harder to make a good life for their children and all their descendants than anyone could possibly imagine.\"\nAt its peak, the town had more than 2,500 residents.

He went on to become president at Facebook (FB) and then an investor at influential Silicon Valley firm Founders Fund. Most recently, he has focused on being a philanthropist and launched the Parker Foundation with a $600 million investment.\nBut he hasn't abandoned his music roots.

One powerful network can cause a \"lock-in,\" he said, referring to Facebook's eclipse of MySpace. But music doesn't suffer the same \"network effects\" that social networks do.\nNonetheless, Parker said one business model has won out: selling music by subscription -- rather than downloads.\n\"It's pretty clear at this point that the subscription model has won, and you see that now with Apple Music,\" Parker said.\nThat's despite what Taylor Swift might say.\n\"Taylor Swift is a bit of an anomaly in the music industry in the sense that she's still able to sell a lot of downloads. She's still able to sell, in some parts of the country, CDs, \" he said.\nVery few artists, however, have the kind of loyal fan base that Swift does, purchasing CDs in droves.\n\"She sort of defies gravity,\" said Parker. \"The business logic that applies to Taylor Swift doesn't apply to a lot of other artists.\"\nParker said there are, in fact, a lot of artists who do \"very well\" by streaming their music on services like Spotify.\n\"And actually, Taylor Swift is one of them.

The minimum age is 18 for volunteering, while the oldest applicant is a British man in his nineties.\nOf the quarter of a million who have registered, 100,000 will be called for 30-minute interviews as part of a rigorous, 14-month selection process.\nThe first interviews will begin on Tuesday at the ExCeL Centre in London\u2019s Docklands while a further eight regional selection centres will open their doors later this year.\nEven the 2,500 interviewers are volunteers and have been trained to the match skills and experience of applicants to defined Games roles.\nSince many volunteers will be required in high-security areas such as the athletes\u2019 village and the venues, all will be subject to Criminal Records Bureau checks.\nLondon organisers say they are hoping to emulate the much-admired volunteer programme at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where the feel-good atmosphere was due in large part to the volunteers\u2019 warmth and bonhomie.\nDuring the 2012 bidding phase, the London team travelled to Australia to study how the programme worked.\nCoe said: \u201cAnybody who was in Sydney will tell you that the volunteers were the defining ingredient of those Games.

At the very least, it certainly makes for a great way to impress your wine friends.\nDespite these clumsy attempts, the good news is that the trick absolutely works. You'll just want to refine your technique to avoid looking like a schlub. First off, it helps to know exactly how the trick works.\nIt turns out that as you bang the bottle against the wall, the force gets transferred to the fluid, which in turn acts like a piston and pushes against the cork.\n\"It's actually quite simple,\" explained James Wallace, an engineer at the University of Maryland, who studies fluid dynamics. \"When you hit the bottle against the shoe, the impact of the [shoe against the] wall provides a more or less constant force to the bottle, which is then transmitted to the liquid.\"\n\"When a liquid is confined, like the wine in the bottle, it can't flow. So the wine is going to act very much like a solid.\"\nThe only real purpose to using a shoe to perform the feat is to buffer the glass bottle from the hard wall, to prevent it from shattering. Not any old shoe will work, however. If the soles are too cushy, then the shock of the impact will be absorbed. Shoes with taller heels won't do either, perhaps understandably. High heels make for a small surface area for transferring the impact, but the angle of the impact matters too. For maximum force to transfer to the wine, the bottle needs to be perfectly perpendicular to the wall. Heels can tilt the bottle at less efficient angles.\nThe best way to refine your technique is to try it out with different shoes. It might also be a good idea to test it out with a cheap bottle of wine; you don't want to spill any of the good stuff. Just keep one other thing in mind: it won't work with plastic corks. The staff at NPR couldn't open any bottles that had plastic corks, no matter how much they pounded."}

(It seems tweens never singularly hope for anything.) Malala is the youngest-ever nominee.\n* How many times has the Nobel Peace Prize been given? This will be the 94th time the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded since 1901. The Peace Prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded since that time.\n* What is the criteria for the award? When Alfred Nobel, a very rich man who invented dynamite, died, his will established the Nobel Prize. He said in his will that the Peace Prize should be given to whoever \"shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".\n* How many people were nominated for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize? The Norwegian Nobel Committee received 259 valid nominations of individuals and organizations. One of those was Malala. You may not nominate yourself.\n* Who are considered the primary contenders for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize? The Washington Post published a list of likely winners for the 2013 prize here. Malala is considered a front runner. Other possible winners are Denis Mukwege, a doctor from the Congo, Hu Jia, a Chinese human rights activist, and former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson.\n* Who decides the winner? The Norwegian Nobel Committee which is made up of five members appointed by the Norwegian Parliamant. This is also why the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo when the other Nobel Prizes are awarded in Sweden. Norway did not become independent from Sweden until 1905.\n* Does the prize go to just one person? No. It can be shared by different individuals in one year (including by 3 women in 2011) or awarded to an organization. Twenty-four committees or groups have won the prize, including the European Union last year, 2012.\n* Why are winners called laureates? The website explains, \"The word 'Laureate' refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel. In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour - both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\"\n* The average age of Peace Prize laureates is 62 years old. (Again, my tween is hoping Malala changes that number). If Malala wins, she will be the youngest.\n* The youngest laureate through 2012 was Tawakkol Karman. She won the 2011 Peace Prize at 32 years old for her \"non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work.\"\n* What do winners get? Prize money worth 8 million Swedish kronor, a personal diploma and a medal. The money comes from the estate of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1897. His will stated that the money he left was to be invested and income from those investments was to be \"distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have"}

{"idx": "24936", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Netlify has a vision of changing the way we develop websites, making it simpler to connect the front-end design to backend services execution. Today, the company announced another step in that vision when it introduced AWS Lambda functions on Netlify.\nThey don\u2019t care what tools you use to build the site. You simply design it and Netlify can handle all of the back-end coding directly at the edge where it is executing. In that sense, it is part Content Delivery Network, part developer automation engine.\nThis ability to build faster more dynamic websites caught the eye of Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Peter Levine, who led the firm\u2019s $12 million Series A investment last August. \u201c[The founders] had the brilliant idea of using microservices and APIs to build more flexible, dynamic websites; deploying to the edge to create a more high-performance end-user experience; and integrating with Github to easily create and manage the application,\u201d Levine said.\nToday\u2019s announcement takes that service approach a step further. Lambda is AWS\u2019s so-called serverless tool. It enables developers to create functions that run based on a particular trigger event without worrying about running a server 24/7. This fits perfect with Netlify\u2019s approach to web development, which has essentially removed the web server from the web publishing process.\nIn this case, the company has created an easier way to run Lambda functions. They believe that while web developers like the idea of event triggers, the AWS workflow has been too complicated. By providing an easier way to create event triggers, especially around developer identity, it will lower the barrier to entry.\n\u201cWe saw the promise [of Lambda] was obvious, but the fact that there wasn\u2019t a workflow around it made it hard to use. We have a workflow for front-end publishing, so [we decided] let\u2019s do same thing for serverless,\u201d company co-founder Christian Bach explained.\n\u201cEach Lambda trigger becomes a tiny micro service you can talk to from the browser,\u201d he said. For example, to make a payment using Stripe you need to code your secret Stripe credentials to enter the payment gateway. \u201cTo make that little call, you needed to run a server from somewhere. People would build a Rails application just for that little functionality,\u201d Bach said.\nWith the Netlify approach, you type in your credentials via a few lines of code then use a Lambda trigger with a little bit of Netlify glue code. This solves the issue of where that code lives and how you manage it, he said.\nIt\u2019s probably not a coincidence that Levine, who sees Edge computing as a big tech driver moving forward, led the Series A investment for Andreessen Horowitz and has joined the Netlify board.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking for a while about edge computing and Netlify is part of the broader trend of services at the edge. \u200bThe company has developed the way to build and deploy modern websites,\u201d Levine said.\nThe company was founded in 2015 and has raised $14.1 million."}

{"idx": "24938", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Over the past two weeks, we have been laying some groundwork on the need to empty our hearts of offense and unforgiveness. And while some people may go through life looking for reasons to get angry and offended, most of us would prefer a life devoid of these feelings. But how do we do that in a world that is insensitive on a good day and downright cruel on the next? We have a couple of options here. The world's way is to avoid people and self-protect. God's way, however, is far more effective.\nFor starters, let\"s examine why we get offended so easily. In my opinion, it is because we were designed to take something very personally, namely our relationship with God. Look at Adam and Eve before sin entered the world. They walked with God on a regular basis. They took their relationship with their Creator very personally; and, from that, they were able to be completely vulnerable to each other (naked and unashamed) without fear or self-protection. Beautiful! They knew who they were and whose they were, and that was enough. Indeed, it was Eve taking the possibility that God was holding out on her (getting offended) that brought the fall. The first offense, and it was based on a lie. I think what we can glean from that is that offense is one of the first fruits of the fall. Hmmm, I wonder if we have a pattern.\nSince the fall, offense has been a way of life for us mortals, because now we take the things of the world personally. Cain and Abel are a perfect example. Only one generation out from walking with God, and we have offense that led to murder. Tragic, to say the least. And it takes only a cursory glance at the Bible to see that after that die was cast, offense becomes a recurring theme throughout the Bible. You can even find it in most of the patriarchs. Does that mean it's human nature and we can't escape it? I don't think so, because along came Jesus, who, through God, was also human to show us a better way.\nJesus showed us that He, like us, was designed to take things personally, and He did. He took every word out of His Father's mouth so personally that it enabled Him to walk offense-free on this planet. For example, at the launch of His ministry, He was baptized; and when He came up out of the water, the Father spoke in a loud voice, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I'm well pleased.\" (Luke 3:22) Jesus must have taken those words very personally, because, immediately following, He went in to the wilderness and whooped the devil. Right after that, He launched His public ministry by speaking at His hometown synagogue. Their response? They tried to throw Him off a cliff. (Luke 4:29) Had that been us, we would have gone home and wailed to God. \"They hate me Dad, and I don't like them either! Bunch of losers. Let them save themselves!\" But not Jesus, because He was busy protecting Himself from offense the right way, and taking all the right things personally. We can't love people by whom we are offended, not fully anyway, because 1 Corinthians 13 reminds us that love keeps no record of wrongs.\nNext week, we will look at just how Jesus took the right things personally, and what that enabled Him to do here. Until then, remember, you are designed to take God personally, and He thinks you are amazing! Live in the Father's love and you,"}

{"idx": "24944", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The mystery of why galaxies formed early in the history of the universe give birth to more stars than modern ones has been solved. An abundance of dense, cold gas fueled rapid star formation in these early galaxies, according to a new study.\nAstronomers collected signals from 19 different 8- to 10-billion-year old galaxies scattered across the northern sky. These early-universe stellar nurseries had much more interstellar gas \u2013 dense, hydrogen-rich clouds at a chilly minus 441 to minus 414 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 than their modern counterparts.\n\"This is really pioneering work,\" said astrophysicist Kai Noeske of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \"It unambiguously confirms that these galaxies really are more gas-rich, so the reason they made more stars back in the day is that they had more fuel to burn.\"\nScientists study distant galaxies because the light they sent out billions of years ago is only now reaching us, and can therefore tell us about conditions early in the universe's 13.7-billion-year history.\nNo one knew why stars form more than 10 to 100 times more often in distant, massive galaxies than they do in local galaxies of the same mass, said astronomer Linda Tacconi of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, lead author of the Feb. 10 Nature study.\nSome scientists had guessed that these early galaxies contained more cold interstellar gas, which fueled the frenetic birth of stars. Others argued that these ancient galaxies had the same amount of gas as the Milky Way, but that suns formed in short, furious starbursts as these galaxies collided, Noeske said.\nDetermining which theory was right was difficult. The cold, dense gas clouds emit such faint, low-energy light that even the most sensitive instruments can barely detect them. Just a few years ago, Tacconi's team searched for signals from these galaxies, but failed, she said.\nThe group was finally able to answer the question by adding more-sensitive detectors to the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, an array of millimeter-wavelength radio telescopes located at 7,381 feet in the French Alps.\nUltimately, the team wanted to know how much hydrogen filled these early galaxies, because it is by far the most abundant element in the universe and in interstellar gas clouds. But hydrogen emissions from these distant objects are simply too hard to detect, Tacconi said.\nInstead, they measured the light emitted from carbon monoxide molecules. As these molecules rotate, they shift from one energy state to another. As they shift, \"they emit photons, and that radiation is what we see as an emission line at a specific wavelength,\" Tacconi said.\nThe amount of light emitted from these spinning molecules revealed the fraction of each galaxy made up of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are found in almost the same ratio in many parts of the universe. So, they used this ratio to extrapolate the amount of hydrogen present in these early galaxies.\nA 10-billion-year-old galaxy was made of about 44 percent cold interstellar gas by mass, while an 8-billion-year-old one was about 34 percent. This is three to 10 times more hydrogen than today's giant galaxies.\nThe study also showed the old galaxies drew in fuel from their surrounding environment in order to"}

{"idx": "24946", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The battle over Huddersfield's health services is continuing.\nThe campaign group Hands Off HRI (HOHRI), which is fighting to save all local hospital services in Huddersfield, is now gearing up to launch its own People\u2019s Commission into healthcare provision across the whole of Kirklees.\nThis is a novel and bold idea designed to challenge the latest proposal from local health bosses to transfer acute and emergency care from Huddersfield to Calderdale Hospital in Halifax. The idea was first initiated by the Save Lewisham Hospital Campaign Group a few years ago which successfully fought off an almost identical plan to close hospital provision in the London borough of Lewisham.\nTheir one-day event was meticulously planned with the help of Michael Mansfield QC, whose Chambers took witness statements from around 100 local people from all backgrounds including patients, health professionals, politicians, and members of the public. Around 30 of these people were selected to speak to an independent panel of experts which considered all of the evidence and came to a conclusion about local healthcare provision in the light of real people\u2019s experiences. Unsurprisingly, they concluded the proposed A&E closure should not go ahead.\nWhilst this had no legal bearing on the proposed closure, it still marked a turning point in the campaign\u2019s public profile and huge public support with over 500 people turning out to sit through the day\u2019s proceedings. Some of the evidence was later submitted to a judicial review three days later which saw a judgement passed in favour of the campaign and the A&E was saved.\nHOHRI has come a long way since the initial proposals were first announced in 2016. At that stage, local health bosses intended to move A&E from Huddersfield to Halifax and to demolish the local hospital, HRI. The biggest campaign in Huddersfield\u2019s history was launched with a huge demonstration of 8,000 people.\nSince then the group has raised around \u00a370,000 to assist with a legal challenge which finally found its way into the Leeds Crown Court in 2018. A judge found that there were at least five counts of public law which had to be tested in a full judicial review. Before the case went before the court, in a separate but linked development, Jeremy Hunt, the then Secretary of Health, announced that the proposal was not in the best health interests of the people of Huddersfield or Halifax and vetoed the plan, demanding instead the health bosses should return to the drawing board.\nHe was responding to a referral from the local Joint Health Scrutiny Committee of Calderdale and Kirklees councillors to a national health body which had been brought together to consider the original plans.

{"idx": "24947", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A new leak on how Facebook uses AI to predict users most susceptible to advertising has thrown trust in the social network back into the spotlight. The company has not been shy in discussing its work on artificial intelligence, which it uses in numerous ways to filter what it believes its users will be most interested in \u2013 and will keep them coming back for more.\nHowever, in the process it raises questions as to whether trust in Facebook has bottomed out, a matter which could be more damaging to its business than any fine levied by the FTC or other regulators. Even with its newest updates to the site\u2019s privacy policies and its tougher requirements for third-party app-makers, it\u2019s unclear whether Facebook can regain user trust.\nAccording to a confidential document, obtained by The Intercept, Facebook has been using its artificial intelligence engine, FBLearner Flow, to \u201cpredict future behavior\u201d of the site\u2019s members. That is pitched as a way for advertisers to more accurately target those potential customers most amenable to their ads.\nFor example, a car company could ask Facebook to identify users who might be likely to change their vehicle in the near future. This \u201cloyalty prediction\u201d also takes into account the chance of that user switching their brand of choice. The theory, as Facebook explains it, is that with a little well-aimed promotion, that user could be swayed to jump to a competitor.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why this might concern privacy advocates. The Intercept points to Facebook\u2019s public outrage over the recent Cambridge Analytica situation, in which the political consultancy is accused of using data on as many as 87m users after it was extracted from an overly-permissive \u2013 and since altered \u2013 API for third-party apps. Facebook\u2019s angst, the site argues, was about the deception involved, not the fact that Cambridge Analytica uses profiling techniques that the social network itself may come close to.\nOn the other hand, however, you could make a convincing argument that this is par for the course in business. What Facebook calls \u201cloyalty prediction\u201d is really estimating churn: the rate of turnover in customers, who stop subscribing to a service in each given accounting period.\nThe problem Facebook faces, though, is that none of its tools, services, or products will ever be looked at in isolation again. In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica debacle, and its mobile apps being overly-greedy about contacts and chat history, and a hundred other death-by-tiny-cuts controversies, the social network has squandered any goodwill it might have generated by allowing you to keep up with family and friends across the globe. The assumption of trust is gone.\nCertainly, Facebook\u2019s bounty of demographic data is a real reason for concern. With its two billion users, the information its prediction engine can crunch through is probably more comprehensive than any other. While it may be, as the user protection promises claim, \u201caggregated and anonymized\u201d for the sake of individual user privacy, that presumably only affects the access third-parties like advertisers get.\nFacebook\u2019s targeting for those advertisers, however, has always been a black box. You tell the site who you want to reach, and your budget, and it handles the rest. Certainly, it\u2019s commensurate with the well-repeated promise over the past few weeks that Facebook is not in the business of selling user data, but it doesn\u2019t mean targeted access to those users isn\u2019t available.\nIn statements about FBLearner Flow, Facebook argues that to say the system is used for marketing is a \u201cmis"}

Sitharaman also accused the previous Congress-led UPA government of not taking a similar deterrent action following the November 26, 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and claimed that the Army was willing to respond if the then government wanted them to do something. \"If only a similar deterrent action had been taken after the Mumbai attack and I have enough reasons to believe the armed forces did tell the government at that time, if you want us to do something we are ready, but we want you to take the call...,\" she said.\nHer statement comes two days after Sam Pitroda, chief of Indian Overseas Congress, asked the government to come out with \"more facts\" on the Balakot air strikes. Prime Minister Modi, using the hashtag 'Janta Maaf Nahi Karegi' (people will not forgive) in a tweet, had attacked Pitroda for reportedly saying he wanted to \"know more\" about the Balakot air attack, including the number of terrorists killed.\nSeveral BJP leaders, including BJP chief Amit Shah, slammed Pitroda for his remarks. Referring to the Balakot air strikes, she said the Prime Minister had clearly said it was now up to the armed forces to take the call on how to proceed and that freedom was given to them. \"When action was taken by us...what is being asked how many people did you actually kill...what is the proof. It is absolutely shocking conduct. The morale of the armed forces is being hit at. So, when the Opposition is questioning you are questioning them (armed forces) and then you keep telling us that don't politicise Balakot. You are the one who is politicising it by asking us for proof by asking the government did you really kill terrorists or did you really cross the border. Pakistan can ask it..,\" Sitharaman said addressing an event 'Telangana For Modi' organised by 'Modi Army' (supporters of Modi) here.\nSpeaking at another event, Sitharaman alleged that not respecting armed forces, but to bring them to shame to make them kneel down to their interests and even defame them has been the approach of the Congress party.

The project aims to establish CAWM as a regional center for SMART-focused protected area management training in East Africa and will build on the initial support provided to the programme by United for Wildlife.\nSMART (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool) is a multi-pronged approach for maximizing the effectiveness of anti-poaching activities and protected area management efforts, all of which is based on a free, open-source software package and an app for smartphones and tablets. The platform allows rangers and other frontline conservationists to collect, store, communicate, and analyze data on illegal activities, biodiversity, patrol routes, and management actions.\nThe College, which is located on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, has been working on the training initiative for SMART since 2017, and this additional funding will enable WCS and CAWM to continue sharing SMART training and supporting CAWM as a regional hub for SMART.\nDuring his visit, The Duke was shown a number of SMART-related activities that are covered in the training courses supported by the United for Wildlife funding including: how data are collected through a live patrol exercise around the College campus; data processing; and use of the information for adaptive management. The project brings United for Wildlife, of which WCS is a member, and the College together to help improve management of protected areas in Tanzania, East Africa and beyond.\nDr. Naomi Doak, Head of Conservation Programmes at The Royal Foundation and United for Wildlife, said: \u201cUnited for Wildlife is incredibly pleased to be providing further support to this valuable work at The College. It has been a real privilege to visit and see some of the training being delivered and to hear first-hand from both past and present students how valuable this training is. The support and training being offered will hopefully help support rangers on the front line with the crucial skills they need to succeed.\"\nSMART has emerged as the leading method for monitoring wildlife law enforcement and protected areas around the globe. It is being implemented in more than 600 sites across 55 countries and has a national government mandate in 12 countries worldwide. Utilized by rangers and community guards, SMART is now a powerful tool for protecting wildlife across Africa.\nLed by WCS\u2019s Antony Lynam, head of the SMART Training Taskforce, and assisted by WCS Tanzania staff Mustafa Hassanali and Ally Bakari, the training program is introducing courses that will be developed into modules for the Technician Certificate, Ordinary Diploma, Bachelor and Postgraduate courses at the College."}

{"idx": "24964", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: An article by British spy agency GCHQ's new director, which suggests leading tech firms have become \"command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists\" and that they need to do more to facilitate investigations, has sparked debate online.\nWhile some have welcomed Robert Hannigan's call for a \"public debate about privacy\", there is suspicion from others that his article foreshadows the government extending his agency's surveillance powers whatever the outcome of the suggested discussions.\nThe message may prove a winner to many people who hear it, who share the view that further powers are needed to tackle the extremist threats faced by the UK at home and abroad. But to those who in the aftermath of the surveillance revelations of the past year hoped for serious engagement and debate, there seemed little to clutch to in this. Hannigan may be thumping the table harder than his predecessors, but the content of his message remains almost entirely the same.\nThe fact that Hannigan has spent his first day firing off a public-relations broadside on this issue shows quite how worried the security services are about the proliferation of communications they can't easily tap... While backdoors might keep the spies happy, sales of devices and cloud services would plummet should word get out that US tech giants were willing partners in mass surveillance.\nPrivacy is a right, Europe says, and there's no getting out of it... In the game of government to Silicon Valley cat-and-mouse, the mice are ahead of their predators. And while GCHQ's Hannigan has a right to debate, he doesn't have a right to complain.\nIt's great to hear that Hannigan wants GCHQ to \"enter the public debate\" on the issue. In public is precisely the place where these matters should be decided: not in the secrecy of the Cheltenham doughnut, nor the obscurity of Silicon Valley's boardrooms.\nThe same tools used by extremists are free to the rest of us too. That gives all of us both the opportunity and responsibility to defend what it is we believe... The battle for ideas online can't be won, or even fought, by governments. It's down to us.\nThere is still just public anger at the way that governments were monitoring web activity and there is still a significant lack of trust within the tech community - the response has been to lock down as much as possible. However, I am not convinced that Hannigan's piece is being received as it was intended - I don't see how a person asking for an open dialogue is asking for a fight.\nIt's one thing to be opposed to the likes of [Islamic State], it's quite another to be amenable to having one's entire communication snooped into. GCHQ's sudden decision to enter the privacy debate is interesting, but it's not clear that it will actually amount to anything.\nSpy agencies are right to be frustrated by the lack of co-operation from Google, Facebook and others... It seems to me that this will require legislation to correct, since the companies concerned have proven themselves incapable of acting sensibly of their own volition, and of listening to their own customers, the majority of whom, if asked, would surely be appalled that their family photos and private messages are sharing a platform with people who want to destroy our way of life.\nImage caption Mr Hannigan said that GCHQ needed greater support from the \"largest US technology companies which dominate the web\"\nIt should be down to judges, not GCHQ nor tech companies, to decide when our personal data is handed over to the intelligence services.

He was unsure about the overtime rule in Sunset League play.\n\"It's been 10 years since I've done high school,\" said Mares, who had his assistant ask the sideline referee if there would be overtime if the match remained even.\nFinding the rule in the book was not easy for Mares. Try flipping through pages with gloves on. Mares wore a pair of black ones because it was a chilly Wednesday night in a league opener at Huntington Beach.\nStanding around in the cold for 20 minutes of overtime play was more than fine for Mares. The Sailors only won twice in league play last season and they were close to getting a victory in Mares' league debut.\nIt appeared a tie was in order before Mares made a substitution in the 97th minute. Henri Ramirez made Mares look brilliant.\nRamirez entered and quickly attacked the Oilers and drew a penalty kick after the goalkeeper took him down in the box. Caleb Candelaria lined up to take the PK and he easily beat the keeper with a shot to the left, giving Newport Harbor a 3-2 victory.\n\"We needed it,\" Mares said of the victory. \"[I'm] just trying to tell these players that they have the ability to step up and improve from last year.\"\nThe Sailors (5-4-3, 1-0-0 in league) have quickly turned things around in Mares' first season. With the victory, he said Newport Harbor surpassed last season's win total.\nThe Sailors are 5-2-2 since going winless in their first three matches of the season. Candelaria, one of the few returning players, has led the way for a young Newport Harbor side.\nThe junior midfielder scored twice against Huntington Beach, a team the Sailors beat last month in a shootout at the Marina Tournament. Candelaria never got a chance to participate back then because Newport Harbor clinched the win before it was his turn in the penalties.\nCandelaria put away his one chance from close range on Wednesday. He can thank Ramirez for the opportunity.\nThe shifty Ramirez came off the bench for Felix Villavicencio and he made a difference right away.\nRamirez took possession of a ball near the Sailors' sideline, 12 yards away from midfield. He then dribbled toward the top of the box, where a defender tripped him up. Ramirez quickly rose to his feet and the goalkeeper, who came out, had no choice but to take Ramirez down. Ramirez had a wide-open look.\n\"He made my substitution look great,\" Mares said with a grin.\nMares was not smiling when Huntington Beach led, 2-1, at halftime.\nThe same player who gave Newport Harbor fits the last time the Sailors and Oilers met did so again. Max Talbert recorded both of Huntington Beach's goals, each time he broke free from the defense.\nMares got tired of seeing the back of Talbert's long hair. The Sailors adjusted in the second half by marking the senior striker with senior Anthony Jovanelly and having someone in front of Talbert.\nThe move more than worked for Newport Harbor, which Huntington Beach Coach Austin Nichols said"}

The study is published in The BMJ.\nThe causes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease are largely unknown and treatment trials have been disappointing. This has led to increasing interest in the potential for reducing the disease by targeting modifiable risk factors. Many studies have found that education and vascular risk factors are associated with the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but whether these factors actually cause Alzheimer\u2019s has been difficult to disentangle.\nMendelian randomisation is a method that uses genetic information to make causal inferences between potential risk factors and disease. If a gene with a specific impact on the risk factor is also associated with the disease, then this indicates that the risk factor is a cause of the disease.\nSusanna C. Larsson, associate professor at the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet, and colleagues in Cambridge and Munich, used the Mendelian randomisation approach to assess whether education and different lifestyle and vascular risk factors are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The analysis included more than 900 genetic variants previously shown to be associated with the risk factors. Comparisons of these genetic variants among 17\u2009000 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and 37\u2009000 healthy controls revealed a strong association for genetic variants that predict education.\n\u201cOur results provide the strongest evidence so far that higher educational attainment is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Therefore, improving education may substantially decrease the number of people developing this devastating disease,\u201d says Susanna C. Larsson.\nAccording to the researchers, one possible explanation for this link is \u2018cognitive reserve\u2019, which refers to the ability to recruit and use alternative brain networks or structures not normally used in order to compensate for brain ageing.\n\u201cEvidence suggests that education helps improve brain networks and thus could increase this reserve,\u201d says Susanna C.

It is unlikely that such a mechanism could be implemented, and even if it could, it would have troubling ramifications for freedom of speech, digital commerce, and Internet governance more generally.\nWhile U.S. policymakers have yet to embrace so far-reaching a concept, a bill introduced this week by Senators John Kerry and John McCain mandates \u201cdata minimization\u201d by website operators, which could provide an opening for broader regulation. Some congressional Democrats are rumored to be interested in the Eraser Button concept.\nFirst, and most obviously, such notions conflict violently with speech rights and press freedoms. Enshrining into law such expansive privacy norms places stricter limits on others\u2019 rights to speak freely, or to collect and analyze information about others.\nThe ramifications for journalism are particularly troubling. Good reporting often requires being \u201cnosy\u201d while gathering facts. Could a public figure claim \u201ca right to be forgotten\u201d when a journalist pens an article about them beating their wife or committing corporate fraud?\nGermany already has a law like this for convicted criminals, who can have old facts about their crimes repressed after they have served their sentences. Such a \u201cright\u201d to repress facts is obviously at odds with the First Amendment here in the U.S., but even a milder version of a right to be forgotten will run up against speech rights.\nSecurity issues are another concern. Is there an iron-clad way for sites to verify someone\u2019s identity before processing a deletion request?\nSuch a system could also open dangerous backdoor vulnerabilities to hackers or others with malicious intentions. More routinely, a parent or ex-spouse who was angry after a bitter fight might possess the requisite information needed to process a deletion request. Similarly, teens often share a great deal of personal information with friends, which could lead to a disastrous scenario if they request deletion of information that is not theirs.\nWhat about shared content? For example, many photographs, blog posts, or social networking entries include multiple people and are copied and reposted on multiple sites (and often archived). Facebook says users submit around 650,000 comments on the 100 million pieces of content served up every minute on its site. If one person decides to hit the Erase Button, must everyone else\u2019s content be deleted?\nAt a minimum, the \u201cright\u201d will lead to a flood of requests -- both genuine and bogus -- from aggrieved parties and ne\u2019er-do-wells alike inundating every website where people can share information. Every blogger could conceivably be asked at any time to delete any comment on any post ever written. Who makes these calls?\nThere are other thorny enforcement issues to take into account. Who actually owns the data collected by online sites and services? Personal information uploaded by individuals may be used by a website or data collection service to run website analytics, serve up advertising to support \u201cfree\u201d online content, or just improve the user experience.

Just when you want to do something, Symantec comes in with a live update for your virus definitions, Google Desktop wants to index new files, and your mail program goes out to collect messages from the server.\nThe defining characteristic of dual-core systems is that they're actually there\u0097they respond instantly.

{"idx": "24982", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Just because you're over 50 doesn't mean you're destined to have skin flaps under your arms and above your knees. Will losing weight help? It depends. Many people wrongly assume that if they simply lose weight, they'll get rid of sagging skin. The problem is, many diets focus on losing kilos - but it's kilos of fat and muscle if you don't do it right. And when you lose muscle, your skin loses its tone.\nSagging skin isn't folds of fat. It's the result of skin that's not being supported by underlying muscle.\nStay strong to stay firm ... toned arms and legs achievable at any age.\nThat's why people who are \"thin\" often have floppy underarm skin or folds above their knees - like the now-famous images of Demi Moore's knees before her rumoured plastic surgery. Once your skin detaches itself from the muscle, it ages quickly.\nSkin stays healthy by attaching itself to muscle and being nourished by it.\nOur body is not meant to be too skinny. The first reason we have muscles is to be able to move, and the second is that muscle fills us out and gives us shape.\nHanging and unhealthy skin is the result of: 1. Losing weight too fast, 2. Poor nutrition, 3. Dieting without exercise, 4. Dieting plus endurance exercise, 5. Dieting plus low-range-of-motion strength training, 6. A diet low in vegetables.\n1. Don't lose weight too fast. Don't embark on a crash diet, like a liquid diet that promises to help you lose 15kg in 30 days. A healthy rate of weight loss - that is, losing weight while building muscle - is up to 1kg per week. Sagging skin can happen when we lose weight too fast. The slower the weight loss, the more time for the skin to adapt and not lose its elasticity and connection with muscle.\n2. Eat food rich in vitamins C, E, A, B complex and K; essential fatty acids; and three minerals - selenium, copper and zinc. All these muscle-and-skin-supporting essential nutrients can be found in vegetables, fruits, animal protein, grains, nuts and vegetable oils, but mostly in: asparagus, capsicum, broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, garlic, olives, leafy greens, bananas, vegetable oils, flax and safflower oils, flaxseed, rice, salmon, sardines, mackerel, oysters, poultry, eggs and lean meat.\n3. Never lose weight without exercise. If you lose weight without exercising, you will lose weight but you will also lose underlying muscle tone. The muscle will not grow in the area where you lose fat and the skin will wrinkle and hang.\n4. Never do endurance exercises while losing weight. If you lose weight by dieting and with endurance exercises - such as treadmill, stationary biking or jogging - you will lose fat and lose muscle. This is the worst scenario for losing weight; the skin will wrinkle and hang the most. Instead, do resistance training and speed lifting using light hand weights. This builds muscle while burning fat.\n5. Use the full range of motion while strength training. If you lose weight by dieting and low range of motion strength training, you will not gain enough muscle in the area necessary. For example, if you do a"}

In anticipation of the midterm elections, organizers toured the country encouraging young people to vote for candidates who support stricter gun-control laws. That didn\u2019t quite pan out exactly the way they had hoped on Tuesday night, as their favored Senate and gubernatorial candidates in Florida didn\u2019t win outright, and those elections are currently still being contested.\nAnd then two days after the election, they woke up to yet another mass shooting, as at least 13 people were gunned down during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, which was frequented by students from the nearby Pepperdine University, California Lutheran College, and California State University Channel Islands.\nMatt Deitsch, the older brother of two Parkland survivors and a member of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School class of 2016, is the chief strategist for and one of the founders of March for Our Lives.

{"idx": "24989", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Simon Wren-Lewis is puzzled by a Ken Rogoff column that sorta-kinda defends Cameron\u2019s austerity policies. His puzzlement, which I share, comes at several levels. But I want to focus on just one thing: Rogoff\u2019s assertion that Britain could have faced a southern Europe-style crisis, with a loss of investor confidence driving up interest rates and plunging the economy into a deep slump.\nAs I\u2019ve written before, I just don\u2019t see how this is supposed to happen in a country with its own currency that doesn\u2019t have a lot of foreign currency debt \u2013 especially if the country is currently in a liquidity trap, with monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates. You would think, given how many warnings have been issued about this possibility, that someone would have written down a simple model of the mechanics, but I have yet to see anything of the sort.\nHere the MP curve represents the central bank\u2019s response function for a given rate of inflation, with rates rising if output goes up a la Taylor. The flat section represents the zero lower bound.\nAs Romer points out in his notes, this can be reinterpreted as an open-economy model if we let capital flows be influenced by the exchange rate (most international econ types tend to think in terms of stocks rather than flows, but it doesn\u2019t really matter here), so that a lower interest rate leads to currency depreciation. In this case the IS curve includes the effect of a weaker currency in promoting net exports.\nNow suppose that investors turn on your country for some reason. This can be represented as a decline in capital inflows at any given interest rate, so that the currency depreciates. If you have a lot of foreign-currency-denominated debt, this could actually shift IS left through balance-sheet effects, as we learned in the Asian crisis. But that\u2019s not the case for Britain; clearly, IS shifts right. If LM doesn\u2019t shift, the interest rate will rise, but only because the loss of investor confidence is actually, through depreciation, having an expansionary effect.\nMy point is that what sounds like a straightforward claim \u2013 that loss of foreign confidence causes a contractionary rise in interest rates \u2013 just doesn\u2019t come out of anything like a standard model. If you want to claim that it will happen nonetheless, show me the model!\nNow, you might argue that IS-MP is a model of the short-term interest rate, and we\u2019re talking about long-term rates here. But long rates are largely determined by expected future short rates, so this argument doesn\u2019t make sense unless you have some story about why short rates should rise somewhere along the way.\nI know that many people find this line of argument, in which a loss of investor confidence is if anything expansionary, deeply counterintuitive. But macro, and especially liquidity trap macro, tends to be like that. So don\u2019t give me your gut feelings; give me a coherent story about who does what, i.e. a model. I eagerly await a response."}

The heads of business lending in the banks do want to lend \u2013 it is how they make money \u2013 and the banks have a vested interest in having a thriving small business sector.\nAnd yet despite this, net lending is down, and business groups complain about lack of access to bank finance. So how do you explain this conundrum? A fascinating study by the new Enterprise Research Centre \u2013 supported by UK banks and the government \u2013 sheds light on what is happening. The paper What Do We Know About The Relationship Between Entrepreneurial Finance and Growth? highlights that there are issues with both supply and demand.\nAs I have written before, demand from small businesses for loans, overdrafts and other finance is down since before the start of the financial crisis. Overdraft applications fell by a third between 2001 and 2009, and have fallen further since. Applications for leasing and hire purchase agreements have fallen by 60 per cent between 2001 and 2012. Much of this reflects lack of confidence by small businesses in the economy. Small firms are doing what households do in times of uncertainty \u2013 paying off debts (which reduces net lending) and saving more. Small firms are now massive net depositors \u2013 with over \u00a3125bn in savings accounts, up 6 per cent in a year.\nBut the academics also find that rejection rates from banks have increased since before the crisis; that the sorts of companies particularly affected are high-risk firms and that banks are asking for more collateral. The reasons are that the high risk lending practices from before the crisis have come to an end. Lending trends since the crisis are caused by \u201cincreased risk aversion, increased uncertainty, and higher bank funding costs.\u201d Equally the paper points to the need for greater awareness and use in business of alternative finance forms, such as equity and asset finance.\nIt is true that banks \u2013 who have been blamed for risky lending before the crisis \u2013 are cutting their risks and being more prudent. One part of that is posting more capital \u2013 banks are required to put aside as much as five times more collateral to lend to small businesses as they do when lending a mortgage. It is all part of making sure the crisis doesn\u2019t happen again.\nBut most businesses do get the finance they need, approval rates for loans remain high at 80 per cent to 90 per cent, and banks are keen to lend. The widening of the Funding for Lending Scheme, which we advocated, is welcome. If you are a small business with a good business plan who wants funding, our message is: don\u2019t be discouraged. Apply to banks for a loan. They are in the business of lending. And with interest rates at record lows, there has never been a better time to borrow."}

Curated by Steinhardt Undergraduate Academic Adviser Lonnie Woods III, this exhibition commemorates Black History Month by exploring the significance of creating art as a black artist against America\u2019s current social and political backdrop.\nThis exhibition comprises works in a variety of mediums, including paintings and drawings; mixed media installations; video and audio pieces; and photography. Woods said that the show illustrates how various works juxtapose each other and how the artists express their identities in works ranging from the autobiographical to the totally abstract.\nThe concept was loosely based on the Black Arts Movement of the mid-1960s, which encouraged engagement by black artists, writers and performers in the creation of a new aesthetic that formed a new identity for black artists within the art world.\nVisitors entering the exhibition are faced with a gigantic black-and-white installation by Steinhardt freshman Kaylee Reynolds. On the surface, the work looks like a subway map, but it is also a self-portrait of the artist that explores her identity as a black female in the United States at different stops. The title of the piece is \u201cUtopia,\u201d the artist\u2019s intended destination.\nAnother section of the exhibition includes photography and video pieces where the mixed media become more colorful as they display shocking pinks and blues. One such work was made by studio faculty member Erika Ranee. The conclusion of the show features a piece called \u201cTic Tac Toe\u201d by guest artist Steven Mosley, an African American painter based in New Jersey. It was in nspired by the famous black artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Mosley uses alternating neon-colored human heads and skulls to juxtapose life and death on a tic-tac-toe board.\nWhile the variety of work in different styles and mediums may feel chaotic, the 17 NYU artists accurately represent the department\u2019s small black population. Woods said the show was created to send a message about the department\u2019s dedication to creating an inclusive environment.\n\u201cjux\u00b7ta\u00b7po\u00b7si\u00b7tion\u201d will remain on view through March 3 in the Rosenberg Gallery at 34 Stuyvesant St. Admission is free to all.\nA version of this article appeared in the Tuesday, Feb. 21 print edition."}
