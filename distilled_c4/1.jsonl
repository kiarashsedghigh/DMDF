DeBrusk\u2019s second of the night (13th of the season) made it 5-3 with 6:14 to play; Marchand\u2019s second (15th this season) found an empty net with less than two minutes to play.\nJaroslav Halak made 33 saves for the B\u2019s, who were outshot, 37-27.\nAlthough coach Bruce Cassidy said in the morning that the Bruins\u2019 habit of surrendering shorthanded goals (eight; tied for last in the NHL entering the game) had been a topic of discussion, they didn\u2019t get the message. A two-man advantage covering 1:55, with another minor penalty tacked on, somehow turned into a 1-0 deficit at 7:46.\nMichael Frolik, caught tripping David Krejci at 5:39, stepped out of the box with teammate Elias Lindholm (double minor, high sticking, 5:44) still inside, followed teammate Mark Jankowski on a shorthanded rush and scored on a rebound when Jaroslav Halak mishandled Jankowski\u2019s playable shot from the left circle. It was the Flames\u2019 league-leading 13th shorthanded goal.\nThe Bruins, who brought the NHL\u2019s fourth-best power play into the game, at least managed to answer during Lindholm\u2019s penalty, when second unit defenseman John Moore beat Mike Smith to the far side from the right circle at 9:02. The B\u2019s took their first lead with 5:41 left in the period when Krejci, who missed the morning skate to be with his wife as she delivered a baby boy, snapped a shot from near the point that Jake DeBrusk tipped through Smith from the slot for his 12th goal of the season.\nThe Bruins still had a one-goal lead by the end of the second, despite allowing an early goal and spending more than six minutes killing penalties.\nCalgary\u2019s Johnny Gaudreau, who was denied by Halak on a first-period breakaway, got his second of the game near the one-minute mark. Halak trapped it on the goal line with his right skate blade, but the play wasn\u2019t blown dead and Lindholm jammed it across the goal line at 1:05. The 2-2 tie lasted just 36 seconds, though: Torey Krug spotted Marchand coming out from behind the Flames\u2019 net to Smith\u2019s left, and hit him with a perfect slap-pass that Marchand steered home at 1:41 for his 14th goal of the season.\nThe B\u2019s weren\u2019t able to add to the lead, however, because they took four straight penalties before the Flames were assessed another. The biggest challenge came when, 1:18 into dealing with DeBrusk\u2019s high-sticking minor, the Bruins were caught with too many men"}

From 1907 to 1914 he successfully oversaw the project that for almost 25 years had consumed millions of dollars and thousands of lives. He was called \"the Genius of the Panama Canal.\" But Goethals felt unworthy of this title, saying that his predecessor, John F. Stevens, truly deserved it.\nJohn Stevens was appointed chief engineer of the Panama Canal Project in 1905 based on his accomplishments -- some might call them feats -- at James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway. The fearless Maine native helped Hill carry out his plan to expand his American rail lines west, and thus contribute to the white settlement of the Pacific Northwest.\nNative Americans had long described a traversable gap in the Rockies that white explorers had not yet found. In December 1889, aided by a Flathead Indian guide, Stevens walked the Marias Pass in Montana -- in 40-below weather, no less. What Lewis and Clark and countless others had tried, Stevens accomplished. The Marias Pass, the lowest crossing of the Rocky Mountains, allowed the Great Northern to expand through the Rockies without a tunnel. The following year, Stevens conquered another pass - now called the Stevens Pass -- in Washington's Cascade Mountains.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt knew Stevens was the right man -- perhaps the only man -- to tackle the catastrophic Panama Canal Project. The Canal's \"affairs [were] in a devil of a mess,\" TR said. The French had begun work on the canal in 1883 lacking experience in Panama's jungle terrain, and also lacking a blueprint. Unskilled excavation led to deadly landslides; outbreaks of malaria and yellow fever took hundreds of lives a week; and effort and money were wasted when railroad track was laid that didn't fit the gauges of the existing railroad. When the project changed hands, American workers didn't fare much better.\nEnter John Stevens. The foremost civil engineer of his day, Stevens stepped in when his predecessor abruptly quit, and he approached the project as a humanitarian effort, as well as an engineering one. With confidence and morale desperately low among the workers, one of Stevens' first actions was to introduce a food car, a haven of entertainment and much-needed sustenance for the men.\nIn addition, Stevens parted company with most high-ranking officials by taking seriously the threat of yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes, and he insisted that workers be immunized against yellow fever (it was impossible, unfortunately, to immunize against malaria). The last case of yellow fever was reported on November 11, 1905, shortly after Stevens' arrival.\nHis workers' welfare on the mend, Stevens drew up logical plans for the canal's construction. One of the first things he did was to call on 27-year-old Ralph Budd, a gifted manager who would go on to develop streamliner trains at the Burlington Railroad. Stevens had supervised Budd at the Rock Island Railroad in Kansas City, and he recruited him for the difficult job of building a railroad across the Panamanian isthmus. Engineering advances, including Stevens' successful push to build a loch system instead of a sea-level canal, were coupled with social ones. Like his Great Northern boss, Stevens built transportation infrastructure and new communities side by side.\nLacking the advanced degrees of many of his colleagues, Stevens shunned any special treatment as an officer. The living quarters reserved for him -- palatial by camp standards -- remained empty"}

We believe in engagement, and first of all, we need the facts,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\nHundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years in unrest between members of the Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.\nBeijing says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists. Officials deny mistreating Muslims there, instead saying they are putting some people through \u201cvocational\u201d style courses to prevent militancy spreading.\nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State Manisha Singh told a congressional hearing on Thursday that Washington was weighing sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses there.\nBut Chapuis said the European Union must engage with China if it wanted to be more than a \u201csoft power\u201d.\n\u201cThe strengthening of the EU-China relationship would show how the union would grow as a full power, not only as a soft power,\u201d he said.\nChapuis added that there was an \u201curgency\u201d to strengthen EU-China relations in the context of the \u201ctriangulation\u201d between the United States, China and the European Union.\nOn the subject of global trade, he said it was normal for major trading partners to have some commercial friction, echoing a line used by Chinese officials to play down disputes.\nAmid an escalating U.S.-China trade war, Beijing has put pressure on the EU to stand with it against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, though the world\u2019s largest trade bloc has largely rebuffed those efforts, and broadly agrees with the U.S. assessment of unfair Chinese trade practices.\nNonetheless, Chinese state media has promoted the message that the EU is on China\u2019s side, and some European officials have expressed concern that China is seeking to capitalize on divisions between Trump and U.S. allies in Europe."}

Experts believe they have been occurring since at least the 16th century. In the 20th century, there were three flu pandemics. Global health officials are watching the swine flu outbreaks to see whether they might spark the next one.\n? 1918. The Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918 was possibly the deadliest outbreak of all time. It was first identified in the United States but became known as the Spanish flu because it received more media attention in Spain than in other countries, which were censoring the press during World War I. The 1918 flu struck mostly healthy young adults. Experts estimate it killed 40 to 50 million people worldwide.\n? 1957. The 1957 pandemic was known as the Asian flu and was first identified in China. There were two waves of illness during this pandemic; the first wave mostly hit children while the second mostly affected the elderly. It caused about 2 million deaths globally.\n? 1968. The most recent pandemic, known as the Hong Kong flu, was the mildest of the three pandemics this century. It was first spotted in Hong Kong in 1968, and it spread globally over the next two years. The people most susceptible to the virus were the elderly. About 1 million people are estimated to have been killed by this pandemic.\nThe World Health Organization said the outbreak has become a \ufffdpublic health emergency of international concern\ufffd and asked countries around the world to step up reporting and surveillance of the disease and implement a coordinated response to contain it.\nBut Mexicans were dying for weeks at least before U.S. scientists identified the strain \ufffd a combination of swine, bird and human influenza to which people might have no immunity. Now, even controlling passengers at airports and bus stations might not keep it from spreading, epidemiologists say.\nThe disease already has reached Texas, California and Kansas, and 24 new suspected cases were reported yesterday in Mexico City alone, where authorities suspended schools and all public events until further notice. More than 500 concerts, sporting events and other gatherings were canceled in the metropolis of 20 million.\nThe Mexican government issued a decree authorizing President Felipe Calderon to invoke special powers letting the Department of Health isolate patients and inspect homes, travelers and baggage.\nOfficials said the decree gives clear legal authority to health department workers who might otherwise face reprisals.\nHealth workers and soldiers joined a broad effort at airports and bus stations to keep people with disease from traveling though or out of the city. But with confirmed swine flu cases in at least six states \ufffd and possibly as many as 14 \ufffd the efforts seemed unlikely to stop the spread of the disease.\nAt Mexico City\ufffds international airport, health workers passed out questionnaires seeking to identify passengers with flu symptoms. Surgical masks and brochures were handed out at bus and subway stations. The U.S. embassy in Mexico posted a message advising U.S. citizens to avoid large crowds, shaking hands, greeting people with a kiss or using the subway."}
{"idx": "1016", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate \u2013 the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time \u2013 Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.\nOn April 2, 1912, the National Biscuit Company announced to their sales team that they were introducing three \"highest class biscuits,\" in a grouping they called the \"Trio.\" Two of the cookies, the Mother Goose Biscuit and Veronese Biscuit, didn't sell particularly well and quickly disappeared from the shelves. The third, the Oreo Biscuit, did. \"Two beautifully embossed chocolate-flavored wafers with a rich cream filling,\" the Oreo Biscuit was sold in a yellow tin with a glass cover for approximately 30 cents a pound (about $7.13 today). While it went national in April, it was just a month before that the National Biscuit Company first registered the product with the US Patent and Trademark Office (registration number 0093009). It is commonly stated the given date of registration was March 6th, which is why that is National Oreo Day. However, a simple patent and trademark search reveals that oft-repeated date is incorrect. In fact, it was actually filed on March 14, 1912 and registered on August 12, 1913.\nSo how did they come up with the idea of the Oreo? By using the time-honored business practice of stealing the idea from a competitor and then marketing it better than the original. You see, there was another popular creme-filled sandwich cookie that came before the Oreo, made by Sunshine Biscuits. Sunshine Biscuits was a company run by Joseph and Jacob Loose and John H. Wiles, the former of which were originally part of the great bakery conglomeration of 1898 (the one that formed into the National Biscuit Company).\nIn any event, in 1908, four years before the Oreo, Sunshine debuted the upscale, and soon to be very popular, Hydrox biscuit, which the Oreo was a pretty blatant rip-off of, cream filling, embossing and all. Of course, Nabisco denies this is where the idea for the Oreo came from, but the evidence at hand strongly indicates otherwise.\nAs for the name, there has never been a firm answer for why the National Biscuit Company chose \"Oreo,\" though there are several theories. There is speculation that \"Oreo\" is derived from the French word for gold \u2013 \"or,\" since the original packing was gold and the item was meant to be a \"high-class\" confectionery. It could also come from the Greek word for mountain or mound \u2013 \"oros,\" since an Oreo is a \"mountain\" of a cookie. It has also been speculated that maybe it was named for the cookie itself, two \"O\" shape cookies sandwiching the cream, O-cream-O.\nThe identity of the designer behind the distinctive emboss on top of"}

The repetitive steps of sitting down in our writing spot awakens our minds to the process ahead.\nRituals \u2014 from how we stir cream into coffee and blow out birthday candles to wedding vows and funeral prayers \u2014 influence how we experience these moments of our lives.\nA ritual can be any set of actions and procedures, usually more than one and often repeated, that are performed in a meaningful or ceremonial way. The process can prompt people to feel a sense of control and calm, according to researchers, and may also boost our enjoyment of the moment.\nPsychologist Kathleen Vohs found that the simple act of lighting birthday candles and singing happy birthday can improve the taste of birthday cake and enhance our enjoyment of food. In one of her experiments the participants were given a chocolate bar. One group was asked to relax and then eat the bar at any time. The other was given a set of detailed instructions to follow before eating the candy.\nThe group that went through the specific chocolate-eating routine actually enjoyed eating the candy more than the other group. The key, according to researchers, is in the deliberate participation of the task. Random movements didn\u2019t add to the joy and spectators didn\u2019t benefit by watching the ritual.\nRituals cause us to savor and connect to our experiences. \u201cThey draw us in,\u201d according to Vohs in the study published in the journal Psychological Science.\nI use rituals daily to draw me into my day and help me sustain a positive mindset. After a short morning ritual I feel greater clarity and calm. This sets the tone for the day. My routine is short and simple because I\u2019m a slow starter and I need the morning to be simple.\nThen, I move into my gratitude list. Each morning I give thanks for three things. I mention different things each day and this keeps me looking for the good stuff throughout the day. With each item I say \u201cthank you\u201d and pause to let the feeling sink in.\nI intend to act with kindness and compassion.\nI intend to experience peace and calm today.\nI intend to focus my attention on writing today.\nThis kind of intention becomes like a soundtrack for the day, something that brings my awareness back to what it is I want to experience.

I recently retired after 45 years advocating in Tennessee for improving outcomes for children and families. The last several years focused on preventing adverse childhood experiences \u2013 ACEs \u2013 and mitigating their impact on children, families and society.\nResearch on ACEs demonstrates childhood adversity leads to trauma and toxic stress that damage the developing brain. This can cause developmental damage, violence, substance abuse, and physical and mental health challenges.\nGov. Bill Haslam and other state leaders launched Building Strong Brains Tennessee, an effort to establish Tennessee as a national model promoting culture change to prevent and mitigate ACEs and their impact, and to enhance long-term prosperity by improving outcomes for children.\nThe original ACEs study identified 10 types of childhood trauma. Five are personal: physical, verbal or sexual abuse, and physical or emotional neglect. Five are caused by family dysfunction: parental substance abuse, mental illness, incarceration, domestic violence and the absence/loss of a parent.\nEach experience of trauma counts as one ACE. So, if before age 18, a child experiences physical abuse and a father in jail, his ACE score is two. Higher scores increase risk for poor mental and physical health outcomes (depression, addiction, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and psychosocial outcomes (incarceration, job failure, lower education).\nIndividuals who become violent often have experienced substantial trauma and have high ACE scores. ACEs are facts, not fate, so safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments can reduce damage from significant childhood stressors.\nDavid Miller has been on Tennessee\u2019s death row nearly 37 years and is scheduled for execution Dec. 6. As a child, David experienced chronic physical, sexual and emotional trauma, giving him an irregularly high ACE score. His biological father and mother both had mental illness; his mother sexually abused him for years. David\u2019s stepfather beat him regularly, sometimes to unconsciousness.\nDavid repeatedly fled the abuse only to be returned home, where the beatings and sexual abuse continued. Later, he was sent to a boys\u2019 school, another experience marked by rampant abuse and assaults. At age 14, David began experiencing seizures and episodes of losing contact with reality, attributable to his severe, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. This condition led to the crime for which he was sentenced to death.\nDavid was dating Lee Standifer in Knoxville when she was murdered. According to court documents, he had significant memory lapses that night and couldn\u2019t explain what happened. He did not dispute that he had killed Ms. Standifer, but only remembered hitting her with his fists.\nIn his 1982 trial, the law did not allow a defense expert as it does today, so no expert testified about David\u2019s diminished mental health. The law had changed by his resentencing in 1987, but his attorney failed to call an expert to testify about his brain damage and psychosis, factors juries often find warrant a sentence of life in prison instead of the death penalty.\nThough lay witnesses shared his history of abuse in his resentencing in 1987, Tennessee\u2019s death penalty statute failed to let the jury weigh this as mitigation, a defect in Tennessee law since addressed. Today, jurors can consider any facts supporting a life sentence over a death sentence.\nSomeone with a life-long history of ACEs whose abuse"}

{"idx": "1021", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Current and former intelligence officials say it is standard practice to suspend a clearance pending the outcome of an investigation. Yet in the case of Cheryl Mills, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff at the State Department, two letters indicate this practice is not being followed \u2014 even as the Clinton email system remains the subject of an FBI investigation.\nA second letter dated Feb. 18, 2016, from the State Department\u2019s assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield, provided additional details to Grassley about the \u201cadministrative error.\u201d It, too, confirmed Mills maintained the top secret clearance.\nHillary tasked Mills with researching through government records more than two years ago, long before the existence of the e-mail server became known. Mills had left State when Hillary did, about eleven months prior to this designation, but her clearances would not necessarily have been closed out with her departure. One might think that her access to certain programs would and should have been curtailed \u2014 especially the \u201cspecial access programs\u201d that ended up in the Hillary e-mail system. Those are so closely held that they\u2019re more eyes-only than Top Secret.\nDan Maguire, a former strategic planner with Africom who has 46 years combined service, told Fox News his current and former colleagues are deeply concerned a double standard is at play.\nThe other interpretation here may be that the State Department isn\u2019t going to budge in its defense of their operation during the Clinton years. They have almost entirely argued that the issues in the classified-information spillage have more to do with disputes over the necessity of classifying the data at all \u2014 although they backed off from that when the SAP data was found, deciding that even a redacted version of the e-mails was too dangerous for release in 29 cases. State might be keeping Mills\u2019 clearance in place to give the impression that there\u2019s nothing to see here, and people should just move along.\nIt\u2019s also possible \u2014 although it seems unlikely \u2014 that the FBI has told them that Mills won\u2019t be a target in the probe. That would be curious, to say the least, since the FBI does not rule out potential targets until the investigation concludes. Any way one cuts it, though, this is a very odd development under the circumstances, and Grassley should start asking for some explanations.\nMinutes before the new set of emails was posted on the State Department website Friday, the House Select Committee on Benghazi announced that the agency just handed over more than 1,600 additional pages of Libya-related records \u2014 a disclosure that comes about four months after Clinton took the stand to testify.\nIn a court filing earlier this month, State said officials originally overlooked the records because they didn\u2019t realize some of the documents had been \u201cretired\u201d to State archives, but Benghazi Committee Republicans took it as what they\u2019ve called ongoing stonewalling from the administration. \u201cThe administration still has not turned over records this committee requested nearly a year ago,\u201d the GOP-controlled panel tweeted.\nIt\u2019s interesting that State buried that release with the final tranche of Hillary\u2019s e-mails, eh? In October, Hillary and the White House both argued that the select committee was just a rehash of other investigations, but State keeps somehow finding material they\u2019ve never released before on the subject. That seems like the same pattern of denial that State used for FOIA demands during and after Hillary\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, does it not?"}

This Friday, Saturday and Sunday you can enjoy live music, arts and crafts, an antique car show, plenty of kiddie rides and games and a few fun, oddball attractions like sumo wrestling. The theme of this year's event is \"Odyssey,\" which will incorporate a little bit of Ancient Greece into the fair. So fairgoers can also participate in the Greco-Roman challenge sporting events or try some gladiator jousting.\nThe fair is entirely organized and run by Hopkins undergraduate students and is billed as the largest student-run festival in the country. \"We expect 150,000 people to come to the fair over all three days,\" said sophomore Katie Rieder, publicity co-chair for the event. \"For me, it's going to be so awesome to see so many people come to our campus and enjoy themselves.

El Al Israel Airlines quickly developed a reputation for its stringent airline safety. The first and last successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place in 1968.\nOn July 23, 1968, El Al flight 426, en route from Rome to Tel Aviv, was hijacked and flown to Algeria. Originally scheduled to depart Rome on the afternoon of July 22, engine problems delayed the flight's departure and in the end, there were only 38 passengers on board \u2013 seven of them El Al employees or their family members \u2013 in addition to a crew of 10. Shortly after takeoff, two of the three hijackers burst into the cockpit with guns. The hijackers were members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which had been founded in 1967 by George Habash.\nThe plane landed in Algiers, Algeria, where the aircraft and its passengers became captives of Algerian officials, starting a more than month-long ordeal for many of the passengers and crew. The 23 non-Israeli passengers were released first. On July 27, the 10 remaining women, passengers, crew, as well as three children, were set free. But the remaining 12 Israeli men (seven crew and five passengers, two of them airline employees) remained prisoners of the Algerian government until September 1, more than 40 days later. They were released following an international aviation boycott of Algeria and the release by Israel of 16 Palestinian prisoners.\nOne set of hijackings that captured particular attention around the world was the plot by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to commandeer five planes, four bound for New York and one for London. On September 6, the hijackers, who demanded the release of Palestinians in Israeli jails, managed to take control of three planes and force them to land at Dawson's Field, a remote former British airstrip in Jordan. The planes were operated by TWA, Swissair and BOAC, the predecessor to British Airways. A fourth plane, a Pan Am aircraft, was flown to Cairo and blown up after the passengers disembarked.\nThe fifth aircraft was an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to New York with a stop in Amsterdam. The two hijackers, a Nicaraguan American man and a Palestinian woman, Leila Khaled, attempted to take over the plane after it took off from Amsterdam. The El Al pilot refused to accede to the demands of the hijackers. The male hijacker was shot by an onboard sky marshal and later died of his injuries while Khaled was overpowered. The plane landed at Heathrow airport in London.\nNorman Shanks, a former director of airport security at Heathrow, told the New York Times that following the coordinated series of hijackings, the international aviation community took action to prevent hijackings.\nA flight operated by the Belgian airlines Sabena from Vienna to Tel Aviv and piloted by a"}

Hopefully, also, the Secretary has gained a greater appreciation of why Jewish education means nothing less than \u2018continuity and survival\u2019 to us\u2026 and why we sacrifice so much to provide it to our children.\u201d Cohen said Thursday in an email to JTA.\nDeVos visited the Manhattan School for Girls on Tuesday and on Wednesday visited Yeshiva Darchei Torah, a preschool through high school yeshiva for boys.\nThe secretary\u2019s visit comes as New York City\u2019s Department of Edcuation investigates whether Hasidic schools provide an adequate secular education to their students. The investigation was launched in response to allegations by former students of such schools that the city and state failed them and that they were not prepared for life or employment in the outside world.\nThe two schools that DeVos visited do have tracks that prepare students for higher education. Their students also take the state Regents exam, which measures their readiness for higher education, but critics say they are not typical of many yeshivas.\nThe New York State budget approved last month included a provision that eases oversight of nonpublic schools, allowing haredi, or ultra-Orthodox yeshivas leeway in complying with state law requiring private schools to offer students instruction that is \u201cat least substantially equivalent\u201d to that offered in public schools. State Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat who represents several haredi neighborhoods in Brooklyn, had threatened to withhold key support for the budget without the provision.\nThe New York Times reported that enrollment in Orthodox Jewish schools in New York is steadily rising. There were at least 52,000 children enrolled in Hasidic schools in New York City in 2013, the newspaper reported, citing figures from the Avi Chai Foundation, and 28,500 in other yeshiva day schools.\nDeVos has not yet visited a New York public school, and was criticized by the city\u2019s Department of Education for skipping public schools on this trip."}

Its current footprint covers the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC \u2014 where it claims that a property on its platform typically comes in about 40 percent cheaper on a per-night basis compared to a business or extended stay hotel \u2014 and the plan is to extend that to 17 more markets in 2019.\nScale will be the name of the game for the startup, which today works with just 650 hosts covering some 3,200 listings.\nCustomers that have already signed on as users include the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Google, SAP, Deloitte, KLM and Stanford and Northwestern University.\n2nd Address has raised $42 million to date, with a portion of that dating back to when it was a rentals platform called HomeSuite.\nHomeSuite focused on providing a quick way to find and secure short-term rentals for people moving to new cities and interested in trying out different neighborhoods before committing to a housing arrangement longer-term. The original pitch was that HomeSuite handled all the paperwork and other painful processes to make it easy both to list a place and to rent it.\nAimed at people who stay between 30 days and nine months, Tam \u2014 who took over as CEO after founder David Adams stepped away from the role \u2014 said a lot of business travellers are looking for something more when staying in a city for an extended period, with the option of a kitchen, more living space and other personalised home effects beyond what you get in a typical business hotel or extended-stay suite.\nAt the same time, 2nd Address saw an opportunity to target hosts, as well.\nThat\u2019s on top of the work that needs to be done to tidy up and maintain a property when guests are staying for as little as one or two nights. \u201cAnd of course you can have a large variety of guests, from those who are well-behaved to those who are not,\u201d he added.\nThat \u201cvariability,\u201d he said, \u201chas come to a head\u201d for some hosts who are looking for more predictable guests staying for longer than a night or two. \u201cThey would rather take a business traveller staying for a whole month any day,\u201d he said.\nBut 2nd Address is not the only company that has identified the opportunity to provide an Airbnb-style platform catering to business users and those who want to host them.\nChief among its competitors is Airbnb itself.\nAs it inches closer to an IPO, Airbnb has been working on diversifying and expanding its operations, and part of that has been to expand Airbnb for Work, which targets business users.

County Board of Supervisors will vote July 17 on whether to put a new property tax on the ballot to pay for capturing and cleaning up stormwater.\nThe proposed parcel tax would cost property owners 2.5 cents per square foot of \u201cimpermeable\u201d surface. That\u2019s a building, a driveway, a parking lot, a concrete patio and any other surface on the property that fails to allow rainwater to percolate into the ground.\nTo determine the tax liability of each property owner, the county has already used satellite imagery and sophisticated technology to examine each parcel and calculate the impermeable surface area.\nThe new tax would burden homeowners and also the owners of commercial property, including retail stores, office buildings, manufacturing facilities and apartment buildings. It will be one more thing that raises the cost of living.\nThe county estimates that the tax would raise $300 million per year for the L.A. County Flood Control District to distribute for stormwater capture and clean-up, as well as drought \u201ceducation,\u201d workforce training, and job assistance for the homeless.\nStormwater cleanup costs are driven by the Los Angeles Regional Water Board\u2019s uniquely tough requirements for L.A.

Yet this is precisely what Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama did during a speech before 150 Chinese students at the University of Minnesota this month. Journalist Tsering Namgyal reports on the story at Religion Dispatches, writing, \"'as far as socio-political beliefs are concerned, I consider myself a Marxist.' 'But not a Leninist,' he [the Lama] clarified.\"\nWell, that's a relief. Those Leninists can really kill ya'. Marxists will just murder you.\nThis isn't the first time the Lama indicated that his soul is as red as the robes he wears. During a lecture in NYC on May 19, the Tibetan leader credited \"capitalism\" with bringing new freedoms to China but then said, \"Still I am a Marxist\"; he then explained that Marxism has \"moral ethics, whereas capitalism is only how to make profits.\" That's some deep thinking right there.\nNow, I have the word \"capitalism\" in quotation marks because it was originated by a communist, and we shouldn't allow enemies of the good to define the vocabulary of the debate. I prefer to call the mostly free market in question a \"natural economy,\" as it is what naturally occurs when people are afforded economic freedom; they will buy, produce, sell and compete. In contrast, communism (in the real world, not in the stateless utopia of textbook fantasies) requires a large, intrusive, freedom-squelching government to micromanage people's endeavors and quash the yearnings of man's spirit. And because the Natural Economy does allow people the most freedom practical (we still must have courts to enforce contracts, for instance), it is infinitely morally superior to Marxism.\nHaving said this, the Natural Economy doesn't have \"moral ethics\"; it just is. It is, again, what naturally occurs when man is permitted to spread his wings. And it will be as moral as the average people who operate within it.\nIn contrast, Marxism will be as immoral as the worst people who operate within it. This is because, while the Natural Economy is governed by those hundreds of millions of consumer votes called the market, communism is ruled by the unscrupulous few who can claw their way to the top in an inevitably corrupt political system.\nBut while Marxism is morally inferior, it cannot be said to have \"moral ethics\" any more than the Natural Economy does \u2014 not in the true sense of the term. This is because it is atheistic. And a belief in morality \u2014 \"morality\" properly understood, that is \u2014 correlates to a belief in God.\nWhy? Because what we call \"morality\" can originate with only one of two possible sources: Man or something outside of him. If it's something outside of and infinitely superior to him (i.e., God) \u2014 if \"Absolute Truth\" exists, in other words \u2014 then we can say that morality has an existence unto itself and is, therefore, real. But what if, as wanting Greek philosopher Protagoras said, \"Man is the measure of all things\"?

Instead of of being presented in the order they were posted, the app would use an algorithm to determine which posts they thought would appeal most to the user. Since then, many users have been frustrated, calling for Instagram to change back to the reverse chronological feed.\nIn the past week, many of those users have posted invitations for their followers to find them on an app called Vero. The app, released in 2015, allows users to see their timeline chronologically, and has no plans to include advertising. In a few days, Vero shot to number one in the iOS app store.\nNicholas Deleon is a senior reporter with Consumer Reports. Nicholas said that for companies that depend on advertising, an algorithmic feed is almost inevitable. \"These apps are not making money unless you're in the app scrolling through your feed and passing through ads. The grand theory behind these algorithmic timelines is that they're showing you content they think you'll like. And if you like what you see, you're more likely to stay inside and not switch away to check your email or listen to music or do something else on your phone.\"\nNicholas Deleon is a senior reporter at Consumer Reports. (Twitter)What allows Vero to keep the chronological feed is that they say they plan to make Vero a paid app. \"If their business structure is not aligned in a way that they need to maximize the amount of time that you spend inside the app,\" Nicholas said,\" that may mean that they don't necessarily need to switch to an algorithmic timeline.\"\nVero is not the first social media company to challenge the big brands, like Facebook and Twitter. A few years ago, Ello tried to take on Facebook, before rebranding as a network for artists. The app Mastodon has presented itself as an alternative to Twitter since its release in 2016, but has so fair failed to get wide adoption.\nWhether or not Vero has a chance to replace Instagram is hard to tell. \"They've definitely gotten a lot of interest in the last couple days,\" Nicholas said. \"They've added hundreds of thousands of users. So there's definitely interest in the short term, but whether or not that turns into long term success... it's social media. It's a fickle mistress, so we'll see.\""}

{"idx": "1046", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding\u2014or even knowing where to look.\nNot all startups are created equal. For one, not every fledgling small business or early stage startup is a tech company. In fact, many in today\u2019s marketplace are not tech-centered but consumer product-focused.\nUnfortunately, much of the common wisdom about starting and growing a startup is geared toward companies with a tech angle: apps, customer solutions, social media tools, cloud companies. Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding\u2014or even knowing where to look.\nTech startups have an efficient and secure fundraising landscape in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. There are hundreds of VC firms rushing to invest in tech, ready to invest tens of billions of dollars. It\u2019s a great time to be a thought leader with a disruptive technology company! But for non-tech companies with consumer products to bring to market, it\u2019s much harder to find funding sources, whether they are institutional, individual, or even angel groups.\nThat's unfortunate, because consumer product companies are an interesting investment. Why do I invest in consumer products? I\u2019ve written before about investing in consumer packaged goods, and here, it\u2019s the same simple answer: returns are more predictable. According to Cambridge Associates, from 1997-2011 (the latest year available) in US Private Equity investments, consumer/retail funds have never had a negative year. The low IRR for investments made in a given year is just over 5%, and the high is 36%\u2014considerably more range bound than technology, which moves from -7.4% in one year to over 100% in another.\nTech startups often hire a handful of engineers and burn through a pile of cash in pursuit of a terrific but often untested idea. If you\u2019re an investor, that means you likely have to pay out more up front and hope for extremely big payouts later. It means you probably have more losing investments for every win.\nThat mythical unicorn in tech investing\u2014the single company, like Facebook or Twitter, that will pay billions on your initial investment\u2014doesn\u2019t exist in consumer products, and that's not a bad thing. Some investors fund companies with a tested product-market fit because, as the Kauffman Foundation\u2019s Angel Investment Performance Project demonstrated, consumer products investors earn an average of 3.6 times their investment in an average of 4.4 years.\nIn addition to these characteristics, many investors will want to wait for companies to demonstrate a product-market fit. That means the product should actually be on the market, and founders should be able to demonstrate demand for it. In consumer products, the data on sell-through and door expansion can be a critical factor for early investors.\nIt is important to remember these investments are risky, illiquid, long-term investments, but for those investors that put in the time on diligence, and look at quality deal flow, I believe that for the average private investor, early stage consumer may be a better place to spend your time than technology."}

The building was left mostly vacant after Jack\u2019s La Jolla restaurant and nightclub complex closed there in 2009.\nWilliams said recent delays in Dempsey Construction\u2019s remodel of the roughly 17,000-square-foot, three-level building are due to challenges with its infrastructure.\nWilliams declined to state which retailers have confirmed to lease space in La Plaza. \u201cTiming is extremely important, as you know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to announce too early.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when we open \u2026 and who we open with,\u201d he added.\nWilliams did say a third-level restaurant tenant is eager to announce their involvement.\n\u201cI would be surprised if, within a month, they haven\u2019t already announced,\u201d he said.\nLJVMA board members voted to write a letter to the City of San Diego recommending that the city waive its usual moratorium on summertime construction for La Plaza, so that work on the project can continue posthaste.\nWilliams said, noting that exterior stuccoing will begin in the next month.\nLJVMA Executive Director Sheila Fortune announced that the LJVMA will receive $46,900 in Economic Development and Tourism Support (EDTS) grant funding from the city for fiscal year 2014-2015 (the merchants group applied for $70,000). The money will be distributed to the organization on a quarterly basis.\nFortune noted that the city\u2019s new bike-sharing program proposes 14 rental kiosks in La Jolla that will mostly be located on sidewalks or within street parking spaces.\nLJVMA board President Claude-Anthony Marengo said he is not in favor of the program taking away street parking. He said bike kiosks would be better located in street spaces painted yellow or red, if the city\u2019s traffic and engineering departments would agree to it.\nLJVMA board members are still grappling with how to ascertain which businesses have paid for a city-issued business tax certificate (formerly business license), a portion of which funds the LJVMA\u2019s efforts to boost business in the Village. Fortune said LJVMA\u2019s fact-finding mission has other San Diego business improvement district groups conducting their own inventories to regain lost funds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re even looking at getting a grant for some college students this summer to help us canvas all of our businesses so we can really get a handle on this, because there\u2019s a lot of money that is not being collected or distributed,\u201d Fortune said.\nThe information will be reported to the city treasurer\u2019s office, which will seek payment from non-compliant businesses.\n"}

Gary Herbert&apos;s Medicaid plan faces a make-or-break vote in the state Senate this week, possibly as early as Tuesday.\nThe Republican governor&apos;s plan is an alternative to expanding the state-federal program as envisioned under President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law.\nAfter months of negotiating with federal officials, Herbert came away with an agreement to enroll thousands of poor Utah residents in private health plans and require them to help pay costs.\nIt mirrors similar proposals from other Republican governors pushing for a way to expand health coverage under the federal law while keeping it palatable to their right-leaning Legislatures.\nThis week, Utah&apos;s GOP-controlled Senate will have to square Herbert&apos;s plan with a competing proposal from Ogden Republican Sen. Allen Christensen.\nChristensen&apos;s bill, also scheduled for debate this week, would cost the state less and cover fewer people, but leave millions of federal dollars on the table. A similar plan is pending in Utah&apos;s House.\nIf the governor&apos;s office can usher Herbert&apos;s plan through the Legislature, it will return to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for final approval and then get the program up and running.\nTo allay lawmaker concerns about the state&apos;s ability to fund Herbert&apos;s plan, the governor&apos;s office announced last week that it was scaling back the three-year program to run for two years.\nLt. Gov. Spencer Cox, the governor&apos;s key broker with lawmakers on the issue, said the pared-back plan allows the state to pay for the program without raising taxes.\nCox said the two-year program will give the state time to study what&apos;s working, and by 2017, a new administration will be in the White House that could offer different options to the states.\nHerbert&apos;s plan includes plenty of other elements designed to appeal to Utah&apos;s GOP-dominated Legislature.\nParticipants pay some of their costs and can be enrolled in a job search and job training program.\nLast year, several Republican lawmakers said they wouldn&apos;t support the plan without the ability to revoke coverage for unemployed people who refuse to get a job.\nHerbert originally sought a work requirement for participants, but the Obama administration would not approve the idea. Instead, Utah can automatically enroll people in the job program as long as it lets them opt out penalty-free.\nTo make up for the watered-down deal, Herbert&apos;s office has said the state might consider cutting state-controlled benefits to those who refuse to participate in the job program, including taking away their driver&apos;s licenses.\n\"It was brought up as an option several months ago, and it hasn&apos;t gone anywhere from there,\" Cox said Monday.\nThe idea has been dormant since lawmaker concerns have shifted from whether Medicaid participants will be working to whether the state can pay for the program in the long term.\nCox said the state could revisit the driver&apos;s license idea once the Medicaid program launches."}

A decade ago, only design-world savants and Moroccans were plopping Morocco\u2019s graphic black-on-white Beni Ourain wool rugs on their floors. Now, with even big-box stores getting into design, you can buy knockoffs at Target, and the hashtag #beniourain has been used 31,000 times (and counting) on Instagram. But it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long the fad will last.\n\u201cRemember how popular sponge painting was in the 1990s, and how chevron was on \u00adeverything in the early 2000s?\u201d says Needham, Mass., interior \u00addesigner Dina Holland, whose popular Instagram account @pleasehatethesethings showcases regrettable interior trends and choices.\nSo, how do keep your pad from looking dated just a few years after you put in a new powder room, replace the great room sofa or hang up groovy-again wallpaper in your foyer?

And, she says, it will last longer since it doesn\u2019t hew to a particular trend.\nClean lines and neutral colors, while not the stuff of Instagram likes, will probably outlast current obsessions such as patterned cement tiles and benches upholstered with ratty sheepskins. Design pros preach that the backbones of your home \u2014 floors, walls and major furniture \u2014 should skew toward simplicity. In a decade, that swoop-armed Pottery Barn sofa might feel more tired than a low-slung, squared-off midcentury modern couch.\nHolland says she sometimes gets pushback from clients when she presents a design proposal with neutral base elements. \u201cThey\u2019ll sometimes say, \u2018That\u2019s boring,\u2019 but I emphasize that the way to do these trends \u2014 macram\u00e9, a bold pattern \u2014 is in a pillow or a small area rug,\u201d she says. It\u2019s akin to shelling out for the little black designer dress you\u2019ll wear forever, then dolling it up with this season\u2019s necklace and shoes.\nSome pared-down ideas \u2014 popular white subway tiles, white kitchen cabinets and Eames chairs \u2014 might seem trendy, especially to folks who don\u2019t have deep design knowledge. \u201cBut if something keeps coming around again and again, like black-and-white bathrooms, I\u2019d say it\u2019s classic,\u201d says S2\u2019s Simon."}

First, this study, and many others like it, anchor their alarm on the supposed fact that particulate pollution causes about 42,000 premature deaths in the U.S. every year. Though the EPA relies on this figure, the epidemiology behind it is very weak. But without this scary statistic, a lot of regulations would fail even the most generous cost-benefit test.\nSecond, particulate levels have been falling fast for the last 25 years, and will continue to fall in the future. Most studies such as this one are relying on obsolete data. What this means is that most black and Hispanic Americans, even in the places that still have the highest air pollution levels like the Los Angeles basin, are breathing air today that is lower in ambient pollution than white people inhaled 20 years ago.

The game was hailed as a gorgeous but broken gameplay experience. Well, Ubisoft finally explained exactly what went wrong.\nWe fell again into this trap of working a lot on the tech, and not allowing enough [time for] the teams to create the content to create something new. In the end, that's the way I see it. We created the perfect conditions for the perfect storm. We had a game that was wonderful in terms of art, but that was not renewing enough of the experience.\nGuesdon compared Assassin's Creed: Unity to the original Assassin's Creed that came out in 2007. Jean explained that both games put the tech before the content, and that both games suffered from the problem of the team trying to bring tech to life as opposed to giving gamers a very thorough gameplay experience.\nDevelopment on Unity started back in 2011 and the game was finished in 2014, a year after the Xbox One and PS4 released. It was also the first exclusive eighth-gen outing for the Assassin's Creed franchise, following up on the previous year's cross-gen outing of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\nDespite having a three year development cycle, Guesdon notes that focusing on the \"low\" level tech blinded the team from focusing on content-driven gameplay.\nIt does make sense in a way given that most people admit that Assassin's Creed: Unity is one of the best looking games from eighth gen and that the design of France is both densely realized and artistically captivating. Unfortunately, a lot of the exploration and navigation was impeded by graphical glitches, frame-rate issues and performance roadblocks; many of these problems persisted for well after six months of the game's release.\nUbisoft decided to change the way design approaches were made for the games that followed, with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate being more content-focused, while Assassin's Creed: Origins was themed around player-choice and an overhaul of the combat system, which was mirrored after games like Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma.\nWhat's interesting is that Assassin's Creed: Unity was about putting tech before gameplay, and it didn't quite pay off due to some hiccups that the team should have fixed before it was released. Perhaps if it had six months of extra development time it could have released as an instant classic instead of developing a reputation of a rushed and buggy game.\nThese days people use Assassin's Creed: Unity as an example of a game that didn't bake in the oven long enough. It's a real shame, because it is true that it does a fine job of visually capturing the French Revolution unlike any other game before it."}

But the truth is that the homeless have always been the left\u2019s problem and the left\u2019s clients. Homelessness occurs mainly in big cities, those glistening jewels of Democratic government.\nSome 25 percent of the homeless in America today live in just two cities, New York and Los Angeles. Read up on homelessness and within a few paragraphs, you will find yourselves confronted by statistics on the lack of affordable rental homes, or the lack of affordable homes, or the underfunding of our welfare programs \u2014 all to be provided by government. To which I would respond that we have spent over a trillion dollars on welfare since the 1960s when then-President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty, and we now have about as many people living under the poverty level as when we began. All that has changed is the amount of money going to the impoverished. Yet the majority of articles I have read on poverty complained that we do not do enough to keep people from becoming homeless.\nNew York City increased services to the homeless to $172 million this year, much of it on improved security and living conditions in the city shelters. Yet homelessness in New York increased by 2.8 percent, and, if recent history is to be our guide, it is going to increase by more next year. Then perhaps the Democrats will increase their spending by another $172 million, possibly by $200 million. That is the way homelessness spending has been going since the days when we used the terms \u201chobos\u201d and \u201cskid rows\u201d to describe what was a minor urban problem. Now it is a major problem, and frankly, I do not think spending money on the homeless is the way to cope with the problem.\nHomelessness is caused by people living radically disorganized lives. The disorganization is caused by alcohol and drug addiction. It is caused by a multitude of pathologies that are never addressed by the social worker, or at least rarely addressed. Ask a social worker, if you can find one who has the time to answer your question. Most are very busy and overworked on problems that are, for the most part, impossible to solve.\nIn the meantime, many of the same people who paved the way for homelessness are busy legalizing marijuana \u2014 and, who knows, maybe cocaine and heroin next. In other words, they are paving the way to make sure that radically disorganized lives become still more disorganized. Moreover, those who are intent on legalizing drugs are paving the way for still more people to participate in the misery of the homeless.\nThe path to the future is not well-lit, but one thing is clear: If urban government continues as it has since the days when the homeless replaced the \u201chobo\u201d and \u201cskid row,\u201d the homeless population will only grow.\nR.

Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nBased on a glance at the headlines, some investors could be forgiven if their immediate reaction to Ford Motor Co.'s (NYSE:F) $182.2 million investment in a cloud-based company named Pivotal, was to roll their eyes.\nIt could be forgiven because some \u2013 hopefully, only a few \u2013 will assume that it took its stake in San Francisco-based Pivotal as a PR play after its cross-town rivals recently announced big moves of their own. In case you missed it, Fiat Chrysler inked a partnership with Alphabet's Google unit to advance their goals on self-driving cars, and a few weeks ago, General Motors made a splashy acquisition of Cruise Automotive.\nBut, Ford and Pivotal already have a history, and this is a strategic move that fits neatly into Ford's plan to become more than just an auto manufacturer.\nLate last year, Ford announced it would be teaming up with Pivotal in an attempt to give the automaker innovative software capabilities; its three-year collaboration deal with Pivotal was aimed to help expand Ford's digital evolution in coordination with its many smart mobility projects.\nWith FordPass, advance parking for events is simple. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nOne of the projects that came from the collaboration was FordPass, an innovative platform for consumers that will offer services such as remote access to vehicles through a smartphone app, as well as mobility solutions to help customers engage in car sharing, and find and pay for parking.\nApparently, Ford liked the results it was seeing, and believed additional investment into the partnership would bring incremental results on its path to becoming more than just an automaker \u2013 a plan that could one day unlock value for investors by forcing the market value Ford at a higher forward P/E multiple than its current 6.2.\n\"Expanding our business to be both an auto and mobility company requires leading-edge software expertise to deliver outstanding customer experiences,\" said Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO, in a press release.\n\"Investing in Pivotal builds on our current strengths in software development,\" said Marcy Klevorn, Ford vice president and CIO, who will join the board of directors at Pivotal, in a press release. \"We plan to quickly add new state-of-the-art software engineering capabilities across the Ford enterprise.\"\nStrategic moves like these will become much more frequent in the automotive industry. It's been nothing short of amazing how quickly technology has consumed not only vehicles' interior infotainment systems, but their core functionality \u2013 consider that the all-new F-150 has more than 150 million lines of software code, compared to a typical smartphone's 12 million lines.\nSoftware is even at the heart of Ford's highly successful EcoBoost engine technology, which will play an increasingly important role for the company as emissions standards continue to increase. In fact, Ford has 275 patents on its EcoBoost technology with another 200 pending -- a majority of them covering aspects of software controls and calibration, according to Ford.\nFord's investment in Pivotal was anything but an attempt to make a splashy tech investment for PR reasons; this was always a part of Ford's goal to help change how the world moves, and to extend itself into new arenas -- all of which is great news for"}

Having just arrived from a visit to Beit Hanun in Gaza, where she loudly and roundly condemned Israeli attacks, her car was met by angry Israelis as it made its way to the nearby site of the rocket strikes. In the Qassam attack, one Israeli was critically injured with shrapnel wounds to the head and a second rocket started a fire at a factory. The evacuated workers were outside as the UN representative\u2019s motorcade pulled up to observe.\nAngered by what many Israelis deem a pervasive anti-Semitic UN approach, as Arbour made her way to Sderot, she was met with a less than warm reception by local residents of what is increasingly becoming described as a ghost town. Residents of Sderot have been relocating elsewhere due to the onslaught of Palestinian Qassam rockets. More than 25 rockets are reported to have been launched from Gaza into Israel in the Monday overnight alone.\nBut, when the rockets landed during her visit, the \u2018less than warm reception\u2019 turned to visible anger, as some Israelis began to pelt her car with stones and chant slogans. The rockets were fired by Hamas\u2019 Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, who said that they did not know Arbour would be in Sderot at the time. Certainly had they known, Hamas would not have fired within eyeshot of their recently departed perceived defender.\nThough not directly from her, Arbour\u2019s accompanying UN spokesman, Christopher Gunness, said that Arbour had pressed the Palestinian Authority sternly in meetings with Mahmoud Abbas regarding the launching of the Qassam rockets on Israeli towns. He said also that \u201cThe position of the High Commissioner is that Qassam rockets are illegal under international law\u201d because of their inaccuracy.\nShortly after the Qassam attack on the civilians of Sderot, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights did not condemn the attack with the conviction displayed in Beit Hanun. Instead, Arbour expressed sympathy for the family of the critically wounded Israeli saying, \u201cI want to \u2026 say how much I share their sense of hopelessness and vulnerability and frustration at being so exposed.\u201d But the reaction of the Israelis in Sderot indicates that they are not interested in sympathy or being anointed by the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights as victims.\nIsraelis are frustrated and angry that they are forced to accept building reinforced student dormitories in Sderot in defense from the relentless Qassam attacks. This growing and increasingly vocal anger and frustration contributed to the recent decision to send the IDF into Beit Hanun in attempts to quell the attacks. It is also the source of the angry reception the UN\u2019s High Commissioner on Human Rights received in Sderot as she loudly condemned Israeli action as \u201cmassive violations\u201d of human rights, while seemingly left to a spokesman to define the Qassam rockets as illegal weapons, saying nothing of the actions taken by terrorists intentionally targeting civilians with them."}

And he said no other variety has been introduced to the market so rapidly. Producers typically plant new apples a little at a time to test consumer demand, but the Cosmic Crisp, which is said to have excellent sweetness and a remarkable shelf life, promises to be a hit.\nWSU researcher Bruce Barritt began developing the Cosmic Crisp about two decades ago. Until 2012, the year he filed for a patent, the tree was known only as WA 38.\nWSU professor Amit Dhingra founded Phytelligence in 2011 to commercialize a method of growing trees from tissue cultures rather than soil, which enables them to reach maturity and bear fruit in less time. Dhingra remains a WSU professor and the company\u2019s chief science officer.\nIn 2012, Phytelligence entered into a \u201cpropagation agreement\u201d with the university that allowed the company to cultivate WA 38 plants for research purposes. The agreement did not grant Phytelligence rights to the trademarked name Cosmic Crisp, but it did include an \u201coption to participate as a provider and/or seller\u201d once the apple went to market.\nIn February, Phytelligence filed suit in King County Superior Court, claiming the university had violated the agreement by refusing to issue a commercial license.\nWSU responded last month, claiming Phytelligence had not met clear requirements for obtaining a license and alleging the company had illegally sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to a grower near Yakima. The university also filed a patent-infringement claim in federal court.\nPhil Weiler, WSU\u2019s vice president for marketing and communications, said the university must protect the \u201csignificant financial investment\u201d it has made to develop the Cosmic Crisp by ensuring that no one grows the apple without proper licensing and quality-control measures in place.\n\u201cThe investments made by growers over the past two decades is at risk as well,\u201d Weiler said.\nWSU claims it terminated its agreement with Phytelligence after the company handed over sales orders and invoices showing it sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to Evans Fruit Co. in April 2016. The university also demanded that Phytelligence destroy any Cosmic Crisp plant materials in its possession.\nPhytelligence has refused to do so.\n\u201cWe are not going to destroy the material because we feel it\u2019s within our rights to get the license,\u201d said Ken Hunt, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t own land, so we used ground over at Evans, in large part because we thought we\u2019d be using some of those buds to service their order,\u201d he said.\nBut he insisted the move"}

It is understood no regulatory action has been taken and not one prosecution has been sought so far.\nWhile VicForests says it is meeting its obligations to log responsibly, critics argue the lack of enforcement is an example of the government\u2019s reluctance to crack down on the powerful timber industry.

It is now focusing its attention on money transfers and other financial services, and delivered its final telegram on Friday.\n\"The decision was a hard decision because we're fully aware of our heritage,\" Victor Chayet, a company spokesman said Wednesday. \"But it's the final transition from a communications company to a financial services company.\"\nSeveral telegraph companies that eventually combined to become Western Union were founded in 1851. Western Union built its first transcontinental telegraph line in 1861.\n\"At the time it was as incredible and astonishing as the computer when it first came out,\" said Tom Noel, a history professor at the University of Colorado at Denver. \"For people who could barely understand it, here you had the magic of the electric force traveling by wire across the country.\"\nIn 1994, Western Union Financial Services was acquired by First Financial Management Corp., which First Data Corp. bought for $7 billion the following year.

It\u2019s easy to look at a budget and just see a bunch of numbers. But the real story of the CPS budget is how we are stewarding taxpayers\u2019 dollars effectively and efficiently to ensure equitable access to a world-class education, unleashing the potential that lies inside every student.\nWe\u2019re providing innovative educational opportunities for our students, from preschool to high school graduation. Thanks in part to the taxpayer-supported Cincinnati Preschool Promise, over 1,500 Cincinnati 3- and 4-year-olds are getting a strong foundation at a CPS preschool.\nWe\u2019re enhancing parent choice at our neighborhood elementary schools by investing $3.6 million to create innovative academic programs as part of our Vision 2020 initiative. Providing high-quality, culturally relevant and responsive curricula for all students regardless of what school they attend is another crucial aspect of ensuring equity across CPS.\nThe school board is investing more than $11.8 million in My Tomorrow, our initiative to ensure all students graduate prepared and with a plan to pursue their chosen pathway: enrolled in higher education; enlisted in the military particularly the Service Academies; and ultimately employed in a rewarding career.\nCPS is growing, and we\u2019re meeting demand by opening more schools. CPS will open the Clifton Area Neighborhood School at the site of the former Clifton School during this school year, and we recently announced the purchase of the former Mercy High School on the West Side.\nAll of these investments drive student achievement, investing in the academic and extra-curricular activities that will ensure that our students are prepared for life beyond CPS as dedicated citizens and part of Cincinnati\u2019s talented workforce.\nThere are other significant details in the CPS budget. For instance, it covers transportation and other special services for over 11,000 charter, parochial and private school students \u2013 CPS spends over $10.4 million dollars on transportation for these students alone. About $44 million of the CPS budget passes through the district to charter schools, private schools and parochial schools, including approximately $23 million of funding for EdChoice vouchers \u2013 money that appears in the CPS budget, but does not support CPS students in any manner. When you add that up, CPS loses out on over $105 million of your tax dollars meant to support academic outcomes and provide services to our nearly 36,000 students.\nNonetheless, we are meeting the challenges of growing enrollment and an ever-evolving educational environment with the creation of a new Strategic Planning and Engagement Committee. This group will look to the horizon and help CPS better plan for the opportunities ahead in the next five years, 10 years and following decades. We\u2019re also working with our legislative delegation to ensure more fairness and equity in state funding so CPS is not as heavily reliant on local taxpayers.\nEquity, opportunity and innovation are the values we\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to in this budget.

Michelle Lujan Grisham and several environmentalist groups on Thursday praised legislation aimed at ensuring the shuttering of the coal-burning San Juan Generating Station near Farmington and establishing ambitious targets for pushing New Mexico toward more reliance on renewable energy sources.\nThe bill is intended to soften the financial hit both to the community surrounding the aging power plant and to Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest utility and majority owner of the plant, which is a major source of employment in Northwestern New Mexico.\nState Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, on Thursday introduced the 83-page Energy Transition Act, which proposes to allow PNM to recover investments through selling bonds that would be paid off with a new \"energy transition\" charge for customers.\nIt also seeks to provide funds to assist and retrain workers who lose jobs from the shutdown and sets a 2030 deadline for investor-owned utilities and rural electric co-ops in the state to derive 50 percent of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind energy.\n\"The bill lays out the road map that will lead New Mexico from a fossil fuel-based economy to a green economy,\" Candelaria said in an interview. \"And keeping with the governor's promise during the campaign, this bill lays out an aggressive 50 percent portfolio standard by 2030, then by 2045 puts New Mexico on the path to 80 percent renewable portfolio standard, which would make New Mexico the leader in the nation.\"\nThe state Public Regulation Commission would have final say over key elements of the plan, such as the proposed fees.\nThe governor called the bill a \"robust package.\"\nCandelaria last year sponsored a bill that also was aimed at allowing PNM to recoup its losses on the San Juan plant. That bill was shot down in a Senate committee.\nAmong those supporting the bill are such groups as the Sierra Club, Conservation Voters New Mexico, Western Resource Advocates and San Juan Citizens Alliance. Also signing on are the New Mexico Building and Construction Trades Council and progressive political groups including ProgressNow New Mexico and the Center for Civic Policy.\nSteve Michel of Western Resource Advocates said the bill \"provides a path for New Mexico to move away from fossil fuels, calling for zero carbon emissions by 2045.

{"idx": "1076", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Germany's population just hit a record high - so what does this mean?\nThere are more people living in Germany than ever before, largely thanks to immigration. Here's an explanation of what the new numbers mean.\nGermany's population reached 82.8 million at the end of 2016, according to government estimates. That's around 600,000 more than the previous year - an increase equivalent to the population of Leipzig - and almost 300,000 more than the previous record year, 15 years ago in 2002.\nBut without immigration - both of refugees and EU nationals - the population would have shrunk. So what do the statistics tell us?\nHow many people moved to Germany?\nAccording to the statistics, over the past year at least 750,000 more people moved to Germany than emigrated from the country. In 2015, this figure was even higher, at around 1.1 million.\nHow accurate is this figure?\nThe immigration statistics aren't exact, experts warn. The 2011 census proved this: the official count showed that around one million fewer foreigners were living in Germany as had been thought. There are a few reasons for this, for example the fact that many immigrants do not inform authorities when they return home or move to another country, while others end up being registered twice.\nWhat's more, many refugees who arrived in Germany during the 2015 migration influx were only officially registered in 2016. According to Sebastian Kl\u00fcsener, an expert at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, the actual number of people who moved to Germany in 2016 is likely to be several tens of thousands lower than the official figure.\nWhere do the immigrants come from?\nThe 2016 statistics don't show this precisely. But experts agree that as well as refugees from war-zones and crisis-hit areas, economic immigrants from East Europe and other EU countries play an important role in Germany's population growth.\n\"EU migration was more significant than refugee migration in 2016,\" said Thomas Liebig from the OECD.\nWhat about births and deaths?\nEach year, more people die in Germany than are born there, meaning the population would shrink if it weren't for immigration. The so-called 'birth deficit' is estimated at between 150,000 and 190,000.\n\"The number of newborns rose slightly in 2016 compared with the previous year, and the number of deaths has risen to roughly the same level as in the previous year,\" explains statistician Reinhold Zahn.\nHow can the 'birth deficit' be tackled?\nThe number of women of child-bearing age in Germany is currently lower than the number of elderly people, meaning that even if these women were to have more children, it would be tough to compensate for the number of deaths.\nHerbert Br\u00fccker of the Institute for Employment Research noted that: \"Migration also increases birth rates,\" not because immigrants have a particularly high number of children, but because they are generally young.\nImmigrants from the EU usually come to Germany to look for work.\n\"Labor migration helps us to cope with demographic change,\" says Br\u00fccker. \"The public budgets, the pension insurance systems, for example, are a good thing, as is the fact that we do not have to go into the population shrinkage.\"\nWhat are the prospects for 2017?\nIt's hard to say.

It also said it will recruit thousands of less experienced developers to work on building applications that use machine learning and deep learning technologies.\nEmbedding sensors into production line equipment to capture data to feed AI-fueled automation development is a key part of the AI R&D plan, with Foxconn saying earlier that it wants to offer advanced manufacturing experiences and services \u2014 eyeing competing with the likes of General Electric and Cisco.\nThe company has also been working with Andrew Ng\u2019s new AI startup Landing.ai \u2014 which is itself focused on plugging AI into industries that haven\u2019t yet tapping into the tech\u2019s transformative benefits, with a first focus on manufacturing \u2014 since July.\nAnd Gou confirmed the startup will be a key partner as Foxconn works towards its own AI-fueled transformation \u2014 using tech brought in via Landing.ai to help transform the manufacturing process, and identify and predict defects.\nQuite what such AI-powered transformation might mean for the jobs of hundreds of thousands of humans currently employed by Foxconn on assembly line tasks is less clear.

Both were in play during Saturday's largely alluring program presented in Herbst Theatre by Chamber Music San Francisco.\nThe performers were three renowned soloists - clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, cellist Lynn Harrell and pianist Robert Levin - joining forces on a more or less ad hoc basis. And the evening's centerpiece was Yehudi Wyner's melodious \"Trio 2009,\" written last year for this ensemble.\nIt certainly sounded like a musical tribute to these particular players, mining the group's ability to blend lyrical strains into a unified yet distinct musical texture. Running 15 minutes in a single span, Wyner's piece proved an amiable and often lovely creation.\nIf the results aren't especially dramatic, that was surely by intent. Rather, the motivating spirit here is one of free-form fantasy, as the piece unfolds in an unpredictable but gently shifting series of episodes.\nWyner's melodic invention is the main vehicle for the proceedings, and his tunes are shapely, inviting affairs, often backlit by delicate tremolo accompaniments. For contrast, the piano occasionally urges the other two instruments into brisk, dry-eyed flurries that sound like toned-down Prokofiev.\nThe performers' mutual sympathy and unanimity of purpose gave the piece a lovely veneer, and continued to yield benefits after intermission. The second half of the program was devoted to a first-rate account of Brahms' A-Minor Trio, Op. 114.\nThis was a performance as notable for its refined elegance - especially in the two slow movements that form the center of the piece - as for its deftly balanced fervor. The rhythmic propulsion of the outer movements, shaped by Levin's strong but never strident quarterbacking from the piano, was beautifully matched by the limpid, long-breathed phrases of the Adagio.\nBoth the Wyner and the Brahms found the performers at their best, and in fact it was hard to avoid the suspicion that those pieces had monopolized all the available rehearsal time. The evening's two opening selections - Bach's C-Major Cello Suite and Schumann's \"Fantasiest\u00fccke\" for clarinet and piano - got careless, throwaway performances that made them sound like last-minute filler.\nStoltzman-Harrell-Levin Trio: Program repeats. 7:30 p.m. Mon.

He says coffee sellers in the state should have to post cancer warnings.\nThe culprit is a chemical produced in the bean roasting process that is a known carcinogen and has been at the heart of an eight-year legal struggle between a tiny nonprofit group and Big Coffee.\nThe Council for Education and Research on Toxics wanted the coffee industry to remove acrylamide from its processing - like potato chip makers did when it sued them years ago - or disclose the danger in ominous warning signs or labels. The industry, led by Starbucks Corp., said the level of the chemical in coffee isn't harmful and any risks are outweighed by benefits.\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle said Wednesday that the coffee makers hadn't presented the proper grounds at trial to prevail.\nThe suit was brought against Starbucks and 90 companies under a controversial law passed by California voters in 1986 that has been credited with culling cancer-causing chemicals from myriad products and also criticized for leading to quick settlement shakedowns.\n\"This lawsuit has made a mockery of Prop. 65, has confused consumers, and does nothing to improve public health,\" said William Murray, president and CEO of the National Coffee Association, who added that coffee had been shown to be a healthy beverage.\nIn 2016, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization moved coffee off its \"possible carcinogen\" list.\nCoffee companies have said it's not feasible to remove acrylamide from their product without ruining the flavor.\n\"I firmly believe if the potato chip industry can do it, so can the coffee industry,\" Metzger said. \"A warning won't be that effective because it's an addictive product.\"\nCustomers at shops that post warnings are often unaware or unconcerned about them.\nAfternoon coffee drinkers at a Los Angeles Starbucks said they might look into the warning or give coffee drinking a second thought after the ruling, but the cup of joe was likely to win out.\nThe defendants have a couple weeks to challenge the ruling before it is final and could seek relief from an appellate court.\nIf the ruling stands, it could come with a stiff financial penalty and could rattle consumers beyond state lines.\nThe judge can set another phase of trial to consider potential civil penalties up to $2,500 per person exposed each day over eight years. That could be an astronomical sum in a state with close to 40 million residents, though such a massive fine is unlikely.\nCalifornia's outsized market could make it difficult to tailor packaging with warning labels specifically to stores in the state.\nThat means out-of-state coffee drinkers could also take their coffee with a cancer warning.

Here are some other famous faces who leveraged their political careers to sell products and services.\nOn Thursday, an AdvoCare spokeswoman confirmed that the former US senator is one of the company\u2019s 580,000 independent distributors. Another reporter, writing for The Daily Beast, tried to contact Brown about his involvement and received a sales pitch in reply; she could save 20 to 40 percent off AdvoCare products if she, too, became a distributor, Brown told her.\nLoyalists asserted Brown was merely spreading the word about a product that had helped him get in shape \u2014 what was wrong with promoting fitness? some asked \u2014 while others attacked him for trying to sell \u201csnake oil\u201d and suggested he eat organic instead.\nWhen he lost his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren in 2013, Brown got back on a more traditional path for politicians: He returned to work as a lawyer for a high-powered Boston firm, got paid for speaking engagements, and set his sights on his next political conquest. He even got a gig as a contributor to Fox News, earning him $136,000 between campaigns.\nBut this latest gambit, which follows his move to New Hampshire and his unsuccessful 2014 bid for Senate, is seen by some as unbearably unglamorous, even for a guy who appealed to voters as an Everyman.\nMany were surprised Brown made such a detour from politics, where he has remained active on the periphery. Brown returned to Fox News as a contributor; last week, he authored a fund-raising e-mail for the New Hampshire Republican Party to benefit Senator Kelly Ayotte.\nStill, Brown\u2019s options have become limited by the political landscape in his new state, said Dante Scala, associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.

In one, AdvoCare was ordered to pay $1.8 million for canceling its distribution deal with a couple who had recruited more than 1,000 people and brought in $50 million in sales.

{"idx": "1109", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: By Tracey Maclin. Tracey Maclin is a professor of law at Boston University School of Law. He teaches constitutional law and criminal procedure.\nToday, in response to a perceived increase in crime and violence, the Clinton administration has proposed police practices reminiscent of 18th-century British search tactics.\nResponding to the pleas of residents of a crime-plagued Chicago housing project, the administration announced its support for warrantless searches of public housing apartments, frisking of suspicious persons, and the installation of metal detectors in the lobbies of buildings.\nWhile the administration's proposals may please those calling for more ``law and order,'' the options developed by the Clinton plan are inconsistent with the constitutional principles James Otis helped inspire.\nThe secretary's treatment of the Constitution leaves a lot to be desired. The Fourth Amendment guarantees everybody the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It is a ``made in America'' freedom - a product of our battle against British law enforcement methods.\nUnfortunately, the Fourth Amendment never has been popular, particularly during tough times. During the Prohibition era, the federal government routinely conducted illegal wiretaps to catch suspected bootleggers. In the 1960s and 1970s, state and federal officials continued this unlawful practice against alleged dissidents and political enemies.\nThe ``war on drugs'' involves officers going onto buses and trains and demanding to see the identification and tickets of passengers. The Supreme Court has said that police officers - acting without a warrant or any evidence of criminality - do not violate our privacy when they confiscate and search our garbage. News programs regularly show police officers, using sledgehammers and accompanied by menacing dogs, raiding the homes of persons suspected of selling narcotics.\nLooking for illegal drugs, a Boston police SWAT team using a no-knock warrant burst into the apartment of a 75-year-old minister, chased the minister through his home, and broke down a bedroom door to grab him. While being handcuffed, the minister died of what was later diagnosed as a heart attack. The police subsequently discovered they had raided the wrong apartment.\nPresident Clinton now wants better security measures at the nation's public housing projects. Tenants will be encouraged to sign ``consent clauses'' that allow police to conduct unannounced searches of their apartments. Questioned at a press briefing, the acting associate attorney general conceded that consent clauses could ``in some circumstances'' be a mandatory condition of a tenant's lease. Housing officials have also been encouraged to conduct warrantless sweeps in the case of an ``emergency.'' These measures, the public is assured, do no violence to Fourth Amendment freedoms.\nPerhaps, to make it truly voluntary, tenants should be informed of their right to reject such ``consent clauses'' and to revoke consent that has been given previously. This is their right under the Constitution. On this point, however, the Clinton proposals are noncommittal. People with limited choices about where to live should not be presented with ``take it or leave'' leases that require the sacrifice of rights that the rest of us enjoy.\nAdministration officials say that tenant support for warrantless searches and mandatory consent clauses are relevant criteria for deciding the legality of these measures. But these officials know that Fourth Amendment rights are personal; they cannot be waived by majority rule. If 99 percent of the tenants of a housing project favor police sweeps, they are free to open their doors anytime they wish. Their desires, no matter how reasonable, should not control the Fourth Amendment"}

A state grand jury refused to indict Pantaleo in 2014.\nCivil rights activists and other observers have been closely watching how Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal supporter of local law enforcement, will handle the racially charged case. Because of its high-profile nature, Rosenstein must recommend whether to allow prosecutors to move forward with an indictment, the person familiar with the case said. Sessions can also weigh in but has given no indication publicly about where he stands.\nThe Justice Department did not immediately comment.\nSessions has long said that he won\u2019t pursue the kinds of wide-ranging federal investigations of entire police departments that were hallmarks of the Obama administration\u2019s approach to reforming troubled local agencies. He maintains the approach diminishes officer morale and can lead to spikes in crime.\nBut he has also said he will hold individual officers accountable for breaking the law.\nBringing civil rights charges against police officers is rare and challenging in any administration because prosecutors must reach a difficult standard of proof. It requires them to establish that an officer not only acted with excessive force but also willfully violated someone\u2019s constitutional rights. Even some career prosecutors familiar with the details of the Garner case acknowledge it would be challenging to secure a conviction, a federal law enforcement official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a pending case.\nJonathan Moore, an attorney for the Garner family, said he had not been informed that charges were recommended but was cautiously optimistic.\n\u201cWe welcome this if it\u2019s true, obviously, but it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d he said.\nBut Pantaleo\u2019s attorney, Stuart London, said he has not been contacted by Justice Department officials in the last few months.

About $1.36 billion of commercial property in the Tampa Bay region is known to be in default, foreclosure or bankruptcy, according to Real Capital Analytics.\nLandlords are falling behind as their tenants, battered by the recession, struggle to pay their rent or move out. About 13.2 percent of Manatee\u2019s office space and 8.6 percent of industrial space sat empty in the first quarter, according to a recent Grubb & Ellis market report.\nAnalysts predict commercial delinquencies and foreclosures will keep increasing as vacancy rates climb and commercial credit remains tight.\nAnd many borrowers who can\u2019t pay will have difficulty refinancing or modifying their mortgages to avoid foreclosure because of how those debts are held, she said.\nAn estimated 30 to 40 percent of commercial loans are held in Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit trusts, which are tax-exempt as long as the mortgages contained within them remain static.\nBut the Internal Revenue Service considers a modified mortgage a new one, which revokes the exemption and subjects borrowers to a 100-percent capital-gains tax, Olefson said.\nThat will have widespread economic implications beyond empty storefronts and office suites, analysts warn.\nLocal governments\u2019 tax revenue will fall, as commercial land accounts for about 40 percent of property taxes and virtually all sales taxes.

{"idx": "1120", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Stock Market Blahs - Or Price Breakout?\nCAUTION is the pattern for Wall Street. There's occasional volatility in the Dow Jones industrial average, but within a lackluster trading range. That pattern of modest ups and downs, analysts suggest, is apt to continue through June and possibly into fall. Still, the consensus here is that the long range direction for the market - barring any unexpected shock - is for the Dow to move past the 3,000 mark. In recent days the Dow has been running around 2,890.\nAlmost anything is possible for the stock market, as longtime watchers know too well. For the moment, however, the market is characterized by the blahs. The ``players [investors] just aren't out there right now,'' says Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Bache Securities. Two weeks ago the Dow shot up some 70 points in a few days, notes Mr. Wachtel, but on very limited volume of share sales. Then on June 18, the market fell more than 53 points, but once again on limited volume. When trading volume is low, program trading can easily kick the market up and down in short bursts.\nJohn McElroy III, who is a principal with 1838 Investment Advisors, based in Philadelphia, also sees a pattern of caution and sluggishness, in part reflecting low volume and continued belt-tightening by the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed does not appear particularly eager to ease interest rates, despite the slowing of the economy.\n1838 Investment was the investment advisory arm for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group until the Philadelphia office went independent in a management buyout in 1988. 1838 Investment manages some $3.5 billion in assets. About 47 percent of that sum is now in stocks, another 47 percent in bonds, and the rest cash.\nThe percentage of assets placed in stocks has been reduced somewhat in recent months, reflecting Mr. McElroy's perception of a modestly overvalued stock market, as well as the relative attractiveness of bonds. If he felt that stocks were a little cheaper, McElroy would be prepared to buy back into equities. He's even willing to allocate as much as 70 percent of the portfolio to stocks.\nMcElroy figures one way to invest in stocks is to look for companies with a solid global presence.\nFor now, he sees a somewhat drifting market, and even, perhaps, a slight downward market correction during the next year - but with the long-term direction upward.\nCould that upturn come even sooner?\nSome analysts say yes. Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal &amp; Company, says the market may flounder for the next few weeks, yet push through 3,000 this summer. The market, he notes, hit an all-time high of 2,935.89 on June 15. June, Mr. Seagle claims, is historically slow for the market, although he's not quite sure why. But he expects the Dow to crack the 3,000 level and settle out at around 3,150 by the end of the year or early next year.\nStockholders can only hope he's right."}

I don't care if we win 3-0 or 70-69. There's going to be days when we struggle on offense and our defense carries the load, and we're going to celebrate them just the same that day.\"\nHe said after the game he strongly considered going on a knee during that final drive, but felt it was only fair to give reserve running back Jordan Wright some carries after practicing all season behind UL\u2019s trio of stud backs.\nAgain, all of that makes sense.\nAs for explaining it, maybe it\u2019s not even worth going through the process.\nMore: Is it possible for UL's three backs to reach potential?\nNapier threw up the notion that injuries"}

But now that we feel we can handle that we are making progress on this broader vision of protecting people across the Internet.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is move beyond a search box\u2026 What we realized from talking to people, especially over the last two years, is that privacy risks have gone completely mainstream.\nPeople really want a mainstream, simple solution for privacy.\nDDG\u2019s aim is to create a \u2018use anywhere\u2019 privacy tool that combines access to its private search engine with tracker blocking and a bundle of other \u201cprivacy essentials\u201d \u2014 such as an encryption protection feature that automatically sends a user to an encrypted version of a website (if there is one), instead of accepting a default non-encrypted version.\n\u201cThe unfortunate reality is that hardly any sites really deserve an \u2018A\u2019 on privacy,\u201d says Weinberg on this. \u201cWe can get most sites up to a \u2018B\u2019 if we can\u2026 block all the trackers and get encryption. Then the gulf between the \u2018B\u2019 and the \u2018A\u2019 is actually their privacy policies.\nWeinberg claims the tracker blocker is \u201cvery effective now\u201d, leaning on the open source community\u2019s expertise, but says DDG also wants to build on the tool and add more privacy and blocking technologies over time \u2014 suggesting, for example, a feature that could thwart hidden cryptocurrency miners, which can get embedded on websites, as something else he\u2019d like to add in future.\nAsked how DDG\u2019s approach stacks up compared to Mozilla-backed private search browser Cliqz, which last year acquired the Ghostery anti-tracker tool so is playing in a pretty similar space, Weinberg argues the rival product isn\u2019t \u201creally integrated\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re more going after a pure browser situation whereas what we\u2019re saying is, anywhere you are, on any device or major browser, we can augment it to help protect your privacy there in a seamless way,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIn general, I think that privacy is mainstream and people want simple, seamless solutions and they just don\u2019t exist \u2014 until now,\u201d he continues, adding: \u201cWe expect most of our search engine users to accept and use the extension and the app because it really extends their privacy protection.\nDuckDuckGo has been profitable since 2014, according to Weinberg. (It makes money not by tracking and profiling its users, as Google does, but by serving ads based on the search terms being used at the point of each search, and also from affiliate revenue.) Hence now feeling flush enough with cash to work on expanding beyond the core private search offering.\nOn the growth point, DDG says that over a third (36%) of all searches ever entered in its ten-year lifespan were conducted in 2017 alone.

{"idx": "1131", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 (JTA) \u2014 When young Princeton engineer Jerry Estrin arrived in Haifa on a slow immigrant boat in late 1953 to build the Middle East\u2019s first computer, he faced just two problems. There were no parts or tools, from vacuum tubes to soldering irons, available in Israel, and there was no staff, trained or otherwise. Now, when Israel\u2019s sophisticated high-tech industry barely remembers its electronic progenitor, Estrin and a few old-timers are quietly marking the 50th anniversary of the WEIZAC computer, its closet-sized mainframe and some 3,000 vacuum tubes resting in a corner of the Weizmann Institute of Science.\tWhat allowed the seemingly impossible project to succeed, Estrin recalled, was the can-do optimism and improvisational genius of Israelis, just five years after they had established their state. Granted, Estrin had a few allies. One was his wife Thelma, who, like her husband, had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin.\tBoth had worked for three years with John von Neumann, the principal architect of the computer age, at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. When they left for Israel, von Neumann presented them with complete plans and specifications for the Princeton IAS computer. On the Rehovot campus of the Weizmann Institute, the legendary mathematician and geophysicist Chaim Pekeris had proposed a computer as early as 1946 for such complex projects as determining the world\u2019s tides and delving into atomic physics.\tAt the time, Albert Einstein, a member of Pekeris\u2019 advisory committee, asked, \u201cWhy should poor Palestine build an electronic computer when there is hardly one in operation on the European continent?\u201d Einstein finally was persuaded and the fledgling Weizmann Institute allotted $50,000, then one-fifth of its total budget, to the computer project. The other chief backer was Meyer Weisgal, who had taken over the leadership of the Institute from Chaim Weizmann. A peerless fund-raiser, Weisgal came up with $100,000, through one judicious phone call, to purchase the computer\u2019s magnetic core memory. The Estrins, New York natives who recently marked their 62nd wedding anniversary, settled in Rehovot with their daughter Margo, who was 10 months old.\t\u201cMy first priority was to hire a staff and then train them in the redesign, testing and fabrication of the computer,\u201d Estrin recalled. He placed an ad in a newspaper and right away ran into another unanticipated problem. Almost all the job applicants were post-war immigrants whose educational and employment records had been lost in the Holocaust. To winnow down the applicants, Estrin devised some simple tests to gauge their knowledge and aptitude. In short order, Estrin put together a core staff of three full-time engineers, a technician and a cleaning woman, who also was put in charge of punchcards. The group was augmented by a few part-time technicians. Ingenuity was needed to scrounge or devise parts for the WEIZmann Automatic Computer, or WEIZAC. For instance, Estrin and his team needed extremely thin copper strips, but were stuck until they discovered a shack, surrounded by goats and chickens, where two recent Bulgarian immigrants had set up shop to make parts for fans and bicycles.

But pollution in urban areas, particularly ones with industrial histories, can potentially pose health risks to gardeners and the people who eat their produce.\nHow serious is the risk? It depends a lot on the gardener. A study conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute surveyed urban gardeners in Baltimore, to better understand their knowledge of potential soil contaminants and remediation techniques. The paper was published in the open-access journal PLOS.\nWith help from the Community Greening Resource Network, information was gathered from 70 gardeners through semi-formal interviews. In exchange for participating in the survey, the researchers offered to help gardeners get their soil tested.\nThe researchers found that gardeners had minimal concern about soil contaminants, and often assumed that if the garden was established then contamination issues had already been addressed. This could be a problem not only because contaminants may make their way into food grown at the garden, but also because contaminated soil may pose a risk to gardeners who touch it.\nThe most worrisome chemical to community gardeners was lead, and rightly so considering tests show higher levels of lead in Baltimore soils than other potential contaminants. However, the researchers write that knowing the history of a plot is key to testing for the right substances.\nThe most common method of avoiding polluted soil within the surveyed group was the use of raised beds with imported soil. However, raised beds can still become contaminated when dirt from outside of the beds is kicked up, from atmospheric particles settling into the beds, and when roots reach deeper than the beds. The community gardeners didn't mention some of the best practices for avoiding contact with chemicals of concern, like growing produce away from busy streets, application of soil amendments, removing shoes to avoid tracking contaminants into the home, washing produce, and peeling root crops.\nFortunately, a number of the study participants were quick to acknowledge their limitations and were eager to learn how to avoid contaminants.\n\"One theme that emerged from informant interviews was the need for a central repository where gardeners could access information about soil contamination,\" the authors write. This could be done by an organization that already has a relationship with community gardens or though the local government.\nThey also write that face-to-face information, through workshops or from master gardeners, is an important means of sharing information. Although 83 percent of the study participants had a bachelor's degree, getting information from fellow growers may be an important way of reaching less educated and lower income gardeners. The authors also suggest that some responsibilities such as soil testing could be handled by city governments.\nDespite the dangers of soil contamination, the researchers emphasize the need to balance warnings with information about the benefits of gardening, so as to not discourage gardeners from planting altogether.\nCommunity gardens provide many benefits to city residents, but pollution poses health risks."}

According to the report, the global market is likely to continue to be influenced by a range of macroeconomic and market-specific factors in the next few years. In terms of demand, Asia Pacific is projected to continue to lead the global market, with the market in the region expanding at a CAGR of 24.8% between 2019 and 2027.\nThe global microdisplay market has witnessed strong growth over the last decade. One of the major drivers propelling the market is advantages associated with the use of microdisplays. Some of the significant features of microdisplay are high resolution and excellent image quality, low power consumption, and compact size. Generally, microdisplays are less than two inches in diagonal. In other words, their diagonal is approximately five centimeters. In addition, high-resolution microdisplays offer excellent viewing experience to users, which results in the increasing popularity of high-resolution display devices. These features allow the deployment of microdisplays in multiple applications ranging from consumer electronics to military, defense and aerospace. This, in turn, results in increasing popularity of microdisplays among manufacturers. This factor is likely to propel the global microdisplay market during the forecast period.\nThe global microdisplay market has been broadly segmented in terms of type, projection type, technology, end-use industry, and region. Based on type, the market has been segmented into reflective and transmissive. The transmissive segment was dominant, holding more than 50% share of the global market, in terms of revenue, in 2018. This can be attributed to the increasing penetration of LCoS and LCD technologies that the transmissive segment comprises. Furthermore, the segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR of 21.3% during the forecast period. Growth of the transmissive segment is attributable to the large number of applications of transmissive microdisplays, which include near-to-eye displays (NEDs). In terms of projection type, the global microdisplay market has been divided into projection and near-to-eye displays. The near-to-eye displays (NEDs) segment is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 25.7% from 2019 to 2027, due to rising consumer inclination toward NED devices such as head-mounted displays and head-up displays. Based on technology, the market has been segmented into liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), digital light processing (DLP), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and others.\nThe OLEDs segment is anticipated to register the maximum CAGR of 25.3% during the forecast period.

Signatures would need to be submitted by early July.\nThis new vote comes after Ohio voters rejected a constitutional amendment in 2015that would have legalized cannabis. Voters rejected it because the amendment came with a requirement that all commercially sold weed had to be grown at 10 specified sites that had been promised to wealthy campaign investors. Ohioans did not want a monopoly on their weed cultivation.\nThe amendment certified by Attorney General DeWine does not limit grow sites, but allows the state legislature to regulate a recreational weed industry.\nThe amendment also allows people to cultivate their own cannabis without limiting how much can be grown or bought for personal use, unlike the 2015 amendment. It leaves the state\u2019s medical marijuana program in place.\nOhio Families for Change seem pleased with the wording of the new amendment.\n\"It gives the small entrepreneur an equal footing with the cannabis conglomerates, while decriminalizing personal adult use of marijuana,\" Varner said in Cleveland.com.\n\"It goes beyond existing Ohio law to protect consumers from dangerous chemicals and pesticides that can be found in cannabis, and has stringent measures to keep marijuana away from persons under 21 years of age.\""}

Two hours. $25-$36. www.rayoflighttheatre.com.\nTrain-wreck fans will be disappointed. \"Carrie the Musical\" is finally receiving its West Coast premiere in San Francisco, but there's little in the version at the Victoria Theatre to justify its fame as one of Broadway's all-time biggest flops. The Ray of Light production that opened Friday isn't exactly the same as the 1988 five-performance disaster - nor is it completely different - and it isn't that bad. Nor good.\nThis is the same authors' 2012 rewrite, which ran for a month off-Broadway. Lawrence D. Cohen, who adapted Stephen King's novel for the original Brian De Palma movie, reshaped his musical script to make it more intimate. Composer Michael Gore and lyricist Dean Pitchford (no, I'm not making up names) threw out and replaced a half-dozen songs.\nIt's a more compact, though still large, show, being given an enthusiastic outing by director Jason Hoover's earnest if uneven cast. Music director Ben Prince's adept sextet is only one guitar short of the New York ensemble. The stagings are ragged but generally effective, especially the special effect that caps the ill-fated prom. And it's well anchored by engaging high school junior Cristina Ann Oeschger as the telekinetic teen Carrie and a formidable Heather Orth as her frighteningly religious mother.\nIt's not Oeschger's fault that there's a big disconnect between the painfully shy outsider she plays so convincingly and the forceful notes she sings with dynamic conviction. Cohen's book works best for those who know the story well - no small number - jumping from one plot point to the next without connecting the dots. Carrie's discovery of her telekinetic powers seems to come out of nowhere.\nThe generic pulsating teen angst songs work best in full ensemble numbers, though choreographer Amanda Folena doesn't build on the raging-hormone energy of her opening. Courtney Merrell is aptly torn as the popular Sue Snell, who tries to befriend Carrie. Riley Krull embodies the entitlement but not the malicious edge of prima bully Chris. Much of the singing of the sappily sincere ballads is hit-or-miss.\nWhere Gore's score works best is in the operatic intensity of the mother's hymn-based arias. Whenever Orth assails her heights of religiosity, solo or in duets with Oeschger, this \"Carrie\" is riveting."}

Unlike the last gen, many of the big movers and shakers this time around are independent developers \u2013 many of the original and creative games on the horizon are from independent developers.\nBlockading indie devs from self-publishing (unless they sign an exclusivity deal with Microsoft or have a publisher pick up the distribution rights) automatically limits what sort of games will be appearing on the Xbox One.\nNow, one of the common rebuttals against indie self-publishing is that a lot of indie games are \u201ctrash\u201d and not of a very high quality. However, when you look at a game like Warframe, where the graphics (especially with a PhysX enabled card) looks better than anything currently on the Xbox 360 or PS3 when they're ratcheted up to the highest settings, at what point do we finally start saying that we need to take these guys and gals a lot more seriously in the industry?\nMany times the biggest factor between indie and AAA was graphical quality, but we're starting to see games from lesser known studios take visual and graphical risks that blur the lines between that distinction, and Warframe is obviously one of those games.\nNow, according to OXM and a few other Microsoft-sided sources, there are some things in the works to help the curating process so that indie devs may not have to jump through hoops to get their games on to an Xbox console. Microsoft at least did make some steps with waiving patching fees for indie devs, so it's not like we can completely rule out a change of heart regarding self-publishing as well.\nOver in the Sony camp things are the complete opposite of Microsoft regarding indie devs, development tools and policies. First up, none of the devs had a problem getting their hands on PS4 dev kits, opposite of the Xbox One. In addition to this, Sony has enabled Digital Extremes to even make use of the PS4's cross-platform functionality, so that PC and PS4 gamers will be able to play Warframe with each other. That should be very interesting.\nLast but not least, Sony allows indie devs to self-publish and bypass a lot of the hard-edged certification processes.\nFor Sony, this all means that we'll be seeing a lot more high-quality and creative indie titles on the PS4 compared to the Xbox One.

Even as Eastwood aged, we, as an audience, got the sense that here was a man that refuses to compromise on the things that mattered. Rather like John Wayne you imagined that Eastwood spent his career playing a heightened version of himself.\nOver the space of 50 years we got the sense that Clint Eastwood, both on and off screen, was a man of few words but those that he did utter were very important.\nIn the political thriller, In The Line of Fire, directed by Das Boot film-maker Wolfgang Petersen, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a Secret Service agent who is haunted by his past. He is a member of an elite squad of agents charged with protecting the President of the United States. He was on duty the day that JFK visited Dallas and he still cannot forgive his shortcomings which allowed Kennedy to be assassinated.\nThe first thing that grabs your attention \u2013 and the most refreshing to be honest \u2013 is the fact that this is the first movie where Clint Eastwood plays his age. Although, this is a tense psychological thriller, Eastwood and Petersen allow themselves the time to poke fun at Eastwood\u2019s advancing years.\nHe\u2019s shown to be out-of-breath while running alongside the President\u2019s motorcade and for a while he is made to look as if his time has passed. He is seen as a bit of dinosaur by some of his younger associates and when a female Secret Service agent Lily Raines, played with sharp-timing by Rene Russo, joins the Presidential protection squad, a few misjudged sexist quips seem to have him on his way to his retirement party.\nBut, experience does count for something and Frank Horrigan is not the misogynist pig that he appears. The President is running for re-election, he\u2019s touring the country, glad-handing the party faithful, meeting the public and seducing the people with deep pockets so they will fund his campaign.\nWhile he is so visible, a mysterious figure wants to make a name for himself by killing the President and he wants to exploit Horrigan and his nightmares to do it. He plays mind-games with Horrigan during late night phone calls and gets the aging secret service agent jumpy, prompting him to sound false alarms, so further reducing his credibility in the eyes of his colleagues.\nHowever, the one person who stands by him and appreciates his instincts is Lily Raines. Unlike many films of this type, she is not interested in him romantically, but she enjoys being his partner protecting the President.\nIt seems that Mitch Leary, as the mysterious assassin calls himself, is a clever, master of disguise and enjoys playing a complicated game of cat and mouse with Horrigan and Lily.\nAfter Horrigan sounds a couple of false alarms, he\u2019s taken off the White House detail, and has to rely on Lily to keep him up to date on the President\u2019s movements and security arrangement while he tries to unmask the real Mitch Leary.\nWolfgang Petersen keeps the plot moving at a cracking pace, while still maintaining a wonderful degree of tension. As an audience you fed with tiny crumbs of evidence at the same time as Horrigan which means you are kept guessing right up until the last minute.\nHis real achievement as a film-maker is to create time for character-development during what is already atmospheric, incident-packed film. We see Frank and Lily slowly bond over this complex and twisted case."}

You can see it by scrolling to the bottom of this piece. It ordered them to send documents proving the identity of their spouses and children on the hospital\u2019s health insurance plan. If they fail to do so, their loved ones\u2019 coverage will be cut off.\nThe letter came from an outside consulting firm called HMS, which bills itself as a leader in health care \u201ccost containment.\u201d But this isn\u2019t cost containment, it\u2019s cost shifting. And the irony is that anyone UIHC does kick off its insurance plan may return to the hospital\u2019s emergency room as an uninsured patient unable to pay for care.\nWe don\u2019t want to just single out UIHC for criticism, however. Its self-defeating effort to cut costs is a symptom of the sickness that\u2019s afflicting health care in Iowa and across America.\nRight now, UIHC and all of Iowa\u2019s hospitals are being squeezed in a fiscal vise. Ever since former Gov. Terry Branstad privatized the management of Iowa\u2019s Medicaid system in 2016, the for-profit providers that run it have been refusing to reimburse hospitals for millions of dollars in care. Last year, charity care \u2014 care for which hospitals aren\u2019t paid \u2014 jumped 17.4 percent.\nNow, under Gov. Kim Reynolds, we\u2019re hearing horrifying stories of Medicaid recipients being denied vital care. In April, the Register reported on a disabled 4-year-old forced to crawl because a private Medicaid provider wouldn\u2019t pay for his walker. The state insists that these cruel cuts have saved Iowans money. But the Iowa Hospital Association says there\u2019s \u201czero\u201d evidence to support that claim.\nOn the federal level, the progress made under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being reversed. After its passage in 2010, the number of uninsured Americans dropped to its lowest level in history while the growth in health care costs fell dramatically, according to the New York Times. But now that Republicans are actively sabotaging the ACA, the number of uninsured Americans is rising once again and so are the costs for hospitals that must care for them.\nGiven the financial squeeze hospitals face, perhaps it\u2019s understandable that UIHC is resorting to desperate measures to cut costs. But forcing Americans to jump through even more hoops to get health care isn\u2019t working. The U.S. spends 17.2 percent of our GDP on health care, almost double the rate in the rest of the developed world.\nThe difference between us and them? Virtually every other developed country has embraced a single-payer system that\u2019s far more efficient than ours. Those nations treat health care as a fundamental human right. It\u2019s time to stop wasting our money on elaborate efforts to deny people care. Instead, let\u2019s devote our resources to providing affordable quality care to every American whenever they need it.\nCathy Glasson is a registered nurse and president of SEIU Local 199, which represents 5,000 Iowa healthcare workers and public employees.

{"idx": "1173", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Earlier this week I took a nostalgic tour of New Orleans in search of the remaining works by renowned British graffiti artist Banksy, who visited almost exactly five years ago. I found that three of the original 14 stencil paintings can still be seen. A few others are boarded up or painted over. In four cases, the buildings where the paintings appeared have been demolished.\nThere\u2019s a part of me that wished more Banksys were preserved. On the other hand, I doubt that the celebrated street artist intended New Orleans to be a museum; he intended it to be a social and political laboratory.\nAnother reason for Banksy\u2019s popularity is, well, populism. Banksy\u2019s street art is free and clear. There\u2019s no museum exhibition admission, no gallery markup, no public art management fee, no profit. Behind the scenes, I suspect Banksy has done pretty well for himself in stencil sales \u2013 the New Orleans Museum of Art has a copy of the umbrella girl stenciled on canvas \u2013 but in public art terms he\u2019s Robin Hood.\nAnd the realistic nature of Banksy\u2019s designs eliminates any residual modern art snobbishness.\nIf you wander 2013 New Orleans searching for Banksys, you'll find a landscape in flux. The flooded green building on St. Claude Avenue where the patriot was painted is gone. So is the abandoned cement block barroom on Claiborne where the kid with the life preserver was painted. There are parts of town where Katrina and the flood are becoming distant memories. In much of the Lower Ninth Ward, it can seem like the disaster happened just days ago.\nWhile searching for the location of a lost Banksy, I noticed a house still marked with the spray-painted National Guard code that indicated a dead body was found in October 2005 (1 DOA, 10/15). That remains the most chilling sort of post-K graffiti.\nHere's a starry pop-culture collision that took place right down on Claiborne Avenue in the Lower 9th Ward. In 2008, Banksy painted his kid swinging on a life preserver very near the future site of Brad Pitt's modern architectural development, Make It Right. Coincidentally, Pitt reportedly spent $2 million on a Banksy painting at auction.\nThe blue corner townhouse on Oretha Castle Haley, where the gas mask band once marched is gone, replaced by a modern office building. The dilapidated and partially burned building near the corner of Canal Street and Sourth Derbigny, where Banksy painted his homeless Abraham Lincoln is also gone. In fact, almost everything is gone for a block in every direction, to make room for the forthcoming hospital complex.\nThis June, a Banksy stencil was cut from a London wall and sold at auction for $1.1 million. Too bad the New Orleans property owners couldn't have cashed in.\nI\u2019ve heard that the ruined 7th Ward residence where Banksy painted his wind-blown horn player also is gone. But I can\u2019t be sure because I never knew exactly where it was in the first place \u2013 somewhere near Poland and Claiborne Avenues, I was told. I also never laid eyes on the kid with an escaped umbrella painted on the Industrial Canal floodwall.\nBanksy's portrait of Bart Simpson on the abandoned hardware store at St. Bernard Avenue and North Robertson Street survived for years.

My real name is Dr. Piggy. I am director of research and development for Designing Women (NYSE: DeWo), a firm that designs women. Three years ago, Peter Gelb, the incoming managing director of the Metropolitan Opera, asked me to create a diva who could bring new life and new subscribers to that venerable art. With a hand-picked team of geneticists, biophysicists, and overpaid music critics, I drew up plans for a creature of superhuman beauty and talent, capable of singing, dancing, acting, and chewing gum at the same time, and charged with an animal magnetism of 10,000 Gauss. We were about to build the prototype when Mr. Gelb called to cancel the order.\nThough the contract is still in litigation, I can see his point.\nIn the summer of 2005, the soprano scheduled to sing the role of Cleopatra in a new production of Handel\u2019s Giulio Cesare at the Glyndebourne Festival in Sussex, England, fell sick. Desperate, the management turned to a nobody: a 26-year-old of Dutch and Sri Lankan extraction, extracted from Australia at the age of 10, and raised in California. The youngest singer ever accepted into the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s training program, she\u2019d made her Met debut as Barbarina, to good notices, at the age of 19. Her name was Danielle de Niese.\nOn opening night, she ceased to be a nobody. Audiences roared themselves hoarse. Critics could barely keep their flies buttoned. David McVicar\u2019s cheeky production\u2014which transposed the action from the Roman Empire to the British and spiced Handel\u2019s arias with dance moves from Bollywood, Broadway, and MTV\u2014seemed custom-cut for de Niese\u2019s outsized talents. In fact it was custom-cut for them, partly. When, in rehearsal, McVicar and his choreographer, Andrew George, saw what de Niese could do, they kept pushing the envelope: \u201cCan you do this?\u201d Invariably, she could.\nLip-syncing on MTV is a breeze; singing opera at full voice while dancing is not. Maintaining precise breath control can be agonizing (\u201cMy heart was beating in my throat,\u201d de Niese says), and one has to shuttle constantly between the tight diaphragm required for dancing and the loose one required for singing. (By the way, this little problem gave the biophysicists on our design team a real headache; in the end, we had to spring for two diaphragms.) To be sure, de Niese did most of the really aerobic stuff during her arias\u2019 ritornellos, or instrumental breaks. Even so, her feat was pretty stunning.\nThose of us who missed it because we were busy designing the perfect diva will have another shot next month, when the same production is mounted by the Chicago Lyric Opera. In the meantime, we can watch the DVD (BBC/Opus Arte). And we can listen to her debut album, a recital of Handel arias released this week by Decca.\nDe Niese\u2019s backers believe she could bring a new generation to opera. I fully expect her to rope in several generations,"}

Therefore, a narrow focus on the negative effect on health may underestimate the total cost of air pollution,\" Zhang said. \"Our findings on the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition imply that the indirect effect of pollution on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought.\"\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) , nine out of every 10 people on the planet breathe air containing a high level of pollutants, with the worst affected regions being Africa and Asia.\nOf the world's top 20 most polluted cities, as measured by the WHO, all are in developing countries. Almost all cities in low to middle-income countries with more than a million residents fail to meet minimum WHO guidelines.\nCity dwellers aren't the only ones breathing in smog either, a study in January found that 75 percent of deaths related to air pollution in India were in rural areas.\nWhile some countries, including China, are taking measures to address air pollution, this will also potentially effect economic growth.\nMeanwhile, the wealthiest city dwellers are able to buy their way out of smog.\nIn Beijing, the rich are specially designing their homes and buying appliances to filter out pollutants in their air and water, while poorer residents are stuck breathing in the unfiltered smog, affecting not only their health but also, according to the new study, their cognitive abilities."}

Sheary intercepted a Justin Abdelkader pass at Detroit\u2019s blue line, cut into the middle of the ice, and used a Red Wings defenseman as a screen to score.\nWith the goal, Sheary now has a point in the last eight of 10 games. Sabres head coach Phil Housley mentioned what has changed in Sheary\u2019s game as of late.\n\u201cA little confidence. He gets that big goal in Columbus. That line for me has been really tenacious. They\u2019re playing and the chemistry is forming. They\u2019re getting some opportunities now. A lot more offensive zone faceoffs,\u201d Housley explained.\nBuffalo\u2019s second goal of the game came on the power play to make it 2-0 with 9:55 left in the middle period. Jack Eichel had a nifty play to set up Casey Mittelstadt with the goal. Mittelstadt was asked if he expected Eichel\u2019s pass to sneak through.\nThe Red Wings would get the next goal of the game with just over two minutes left in the second period to cut the Sabres\u2019 lead to 2-1. Detroit\u2019s Dylan Larkin showed off his speed to get around the net and beat Buffalo\u2019s Linus Ullmark on the wrap around.\nBut Buffalo wasn\u2019t content with heading to the locker room with only a one-goal lead. Kyle Okposo took a pass from Rasmus Ristolainen on the power play and put it over the goaltender\u2019s right shoulder to extend the lead to 3-1. That goal came 19:29 into the period and provided some insurance for the team headed to the locker room.\nOkposo\u2019s goal was Buffalo\u2019s second of the game on the power play. The PP unit has really turned it around this month. For reference, the team only scored one goal with the man advantage in January. They\u2019ve already tallied five power-play goals in February.\nWith the team on the outside looking in of the playoffs, Saturday\u2019s performance is one the Sabres will look to build off.\nBuffalo won\u2019t have much time to rest, as they\u2019re hosting the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday afternoon. Another win would be huge for the team\u2019s confidence, especially considering Winnipeg\u2019s the top team in the Western Conference with a 34-18-3 record."}

Lauderdale, is being held on first-degree murder in the death of his father, James (Skip) Scandirito, 74, a former Macomb County commissioner and 41B District Court judge who served Mt. Clemens and Clinton and Harrison townships.\nIn January 2000, the elder Scandirito resigned as judge days before the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission planned to conduct a hearing on allegations that he offered five Macomb County women leniency in return for sexual favors, the Free Press reported.\nScandirito reported his father missing April 1, said Boca Raton Police Officer Jessica Desir.

Should an approval be granted by the Commonwealth Minister, it is highly likely to be appealed, which could delay the commencement of the project.\"\nFederal Environment Minister Greg Hunt is considering whether to approve a State Government plan to dump about 3 million cubic metres of dredge spoils west of the port as an alternative to a controversial plan to dispose of it at sea on the Great Barrier Reef.\nIn October, Mr Hunt agreed to a Queensland Government request to assess the project on \"preliminary documentation\", which streamlines the process.\nPremier Campbell Newman's Government reportedly wants to begin preparatory excavation work as early as New Year's Day.\nThe Caley Valley is a nationally recognised wetland and provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds, some migrating from as far away as the Arctic Circle.\nThe Newman Government has told the ABC about 150 hectares, or 2.5 per cent of the total area of the wetland, would be affected by the dredge spoil dumping plan.\nEnvironmentalists and the state Opposition have criticised the plan as rushed, warning that not enough is known about how the wetland will react to the development.\nThe Newman Government is keen to improve coal-handling facilities to kick-start the mining of coal reserves in the Galilee Basin inland of the port, where Indian mining giant Adani has proposed building one of the world's biggest coal mines.\n\"It's kind of an insane idea of really trying to satisfy the pressure from Adani to get this development going as quickly as possible because they've threatened to withdraw from the development if they're not dredging by 2015,\" Jeremy Tager, of the Far North Queensland Conservation Council, told the ABC.\nThe office of State Development Minister Jeff Seeney told the ABC that the dumping of dredge spoil on part of the wetlands was expected to result in \"impact, both direct and indirect, to migratory birds and the Australian Painted Snipe\".\nBut Mr Seeney said the plan included an offset of 1,400 hectares, many times more than the wetland area affected by the dredge spoil dumping.\n"}
{"idx": "1187", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and a blow for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nThe case concerned a husband and wife, Geoff and Diana Jones, and their company, Arctic Systems, which was set up in 1992. In common with family businesses' tax planning and on the advice of their accountants, one share was issued to Mrs Jones and one share to Mr Jones. The company was used to exploit the personal services of Mr Jones as an IT consultant. However, Mrs Jones did all the bookkeeping, liaised with the accountants and the bank, organised insurance, dealt with the contracts and dealt with other administrative tasks for around four or five hours an week on the company's business. Both Mr and Mrs Jones received a salary from the company, on which PAYE was accounted for. Mr and Mrs Jones received \u00a38,400 and \u00a33,600 per annum respectively.\nIn 1999/2000, dividends of \u00a325,767.25 were paid to each of the shareholders. HMRC assessed that the dividend paid to Mrs Jones was income deemed to be the income of Mr Jones.\nThe settlements legislation is intended to prevent an individual from gaining a tax advantage by making arrangements which divert his or her annual income to another person who is liable to tax at a lower rate. In the case of Mr and Mrs Jones, HMRC claimed that by allowing Mrs Jones to be an equal shareholder and not drawing most of the income as a salary, Mr Jones had entered into arrangements which amounted to a settlement.\nThe Court of Appeal found in favour of the Joneses and said that the subscription by Mrs Jones for her share was a normal commercial transaction, so no settlement arose.\nThe court also noted it was important that there was no contract or obligation for Mr Jones to provide his services to the company at an undervalue.\nAs a result of the previous High Court decision, many taxpayers in a similar situation may have been advised to prepare and submit their self-assessment tax returns for the year ended 5 April 2005 based on the decision which has now been overturned by the Court of Appeal. This could mean that one spouse is paying tax on the other spouse's income.\nIf this is the case, you should 'repair' the return based on the decision passed down on 15 December 2005. For the 2004/05 tax return you will have until 31 January 2007 to do this. However, as payments on account are based on the previous year, you may be making higher payments on account, so you should therefore make a claim to reduce these if you did not repair the return before 31 January 2006. Speak to your tax office about how to do this.\nFor taxpayers who self-assessed on the basis that the case would be overturned, no action is needed on their returns."}

This can bring on a sense of alarm as the layers of clothing come off, and may lead us to desperate measures (i.e.- drinking lemonade with berbere for 10 days). While these quick fixes are tempting, and may help us squeeze into an outfit for a special event, they aren\u2019t sustainable.\nRather than beat ourselves up for not sticking with our New Years resolutions, we can look at summer as a time to recommit to our health and fitness plan.

{"idx": "1190", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released guidelines today for automakers to build nondistracting electronics into cars, but fell short of passing regulations.\nRather than write regulations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released finalized guidelines for automakers to build cabin electronics into vehicle that will not distract drivers. These guidelines come after a comment period on a draft release by NHTSA last year.\nNHTSA included its responses to comments and the new guidelines in a 281 page PDF made available on its Web site.\nIn justification of the new guidelines, NHTSA revealed that a recent test of distracted driving it conducted showed that texting doubled the risk of a 'near-crash' over attentive driving. While the test found that manually operating a phone also increased the risk of a crash, NHTSA found no increased risk of crash when a driver engaged in a hands-free call.\nNHTSA's statistics also show that undue attention may be placed on distracted driving caused by personal electronics. Of crashes reported between 2006 and 2010, 17 percent were caused by distracted drivers. However, an average of a little over 2 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction related to an in-car control, such as a radio or navigation system. And an average of less than 5 percent of that 17 percent were caused by distraction from a portable electronic device, typically a mobile phone.\nIn many ways, NHTSA revised its initial guidelines in response to automaker comments, clarifying or doing away with some particularly onerous or ridiculous measures.\nThe initial release, by proposing no dynamic images visible to the driver, seemed to prohibit the use of modern navigation systems. Responding to objections by manufacturers, NHTSA clarified that it did not intend to mean navigation systems should have static maps. The new guidelines state that maps should not include 'three-dimensional, photographic, full location scenery, and/or satellite images'.\nAudi, Tesla, and BMW offer navigation systems that do show satellite imagery.\nNHTSA justified its guidelines for less complicated map displays by citing a 1995 report on navigation systems by the Federal Highway Administration, apparently ignoring the great strides in technology made over the intervening years.\nAnother issue that arose from the draft guidelines was that cabin electronics, such as a stereo, should show no more than 30 characters on a text display, and that characters should not scroll. NHTSA based the 30-character restriction on guidelines from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA).\nAutomakers pointed out in comments that the JAMA guideline was based on Kanji characters, an ideogramic language where a single character can represent an entire word. A Kanji sentence of thirty characters could translate to an English sentence of 120 characters.\nNHTSA changed its recommendation to a general prohibition of text from \"books, periodical publications, Web page content, social media content, text-based advertising and marketing, or text-based messages.\"\nNHTSA intends to release two more sets of guidelines, considered Phase 2 and Phase 3 of its distracted driving recommendations.

{"idx": "1197", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: AS the Gulf war enters its third week, Jordan's King Hussein is coming under enormous international and domestic pressure which is pulling him in two different directions. On the one hand, according to Jordanian officials, the country's refusal to support the coalition forces arrayed against Iraq is leading Jordan's already weak economy toward collapse. At the same time, popular pressure to give more support to the Iraqi people is growing.\nSo far, the king has successfully reconciled two difficult objectives: keeping his country out of the war and remaining firm in his opposition to the coalition attacks on Iraq.\nThe most serious form of pressure, Jordanian officials believe, was the attacks by coalition planes early last week against Jordanian civilian vehicles and nine oil tankers on the highway between Baghdad and the Jordanian border. The government said four Jordanians were killed and several injured.\nForeign Minister Taher al-Masri protested the attack to the United States ambassador in Jordan, describing it as a violation of the Geneva conventions. ``We have an agreement with the United Nations that excludes [oil] imports from Iraq [because of an international embargo],'' he told parliament. The UN has approved oil imports from Iraq despite the embargo, although officials in Amman yesterday reportedly requested that Syria supply the oil.\nMr. Masri, however, said that Jordan will not change its position on opposing the attack against Iraq. ``If this [attack was] intended to make us change our position, it will not.... We will keep to our principles,'' he vowed.\nAlthough officials say Jordan is trying not to be drawn into the war for fear of an Israeli invasion, Masri warned that Jordan reserved the right to fight back if air raids against civilians and oil tankers were repeated.\nAnother means of pressure Jordan believes it has been subjected to has been the decline of foreign financial aid to the kingdom. Officials say that Jordan has not received any of the pledged aid from European countries while the US and Saudi Arabia - once its two main financial backers - have stopped the flow of aid to the country.\nJordan's only port of Aqaba is under de facto blockade by US and other coalition navies. Jordanian officials say the country is finding it difficult to secure the import of food stuffs and medicine as importers fear the goods will find their way to Iraq.\nReal wages have been cut to one-third of their value; unemployment stands at 15 percent and is expected to reach 40 percent; many factories have reportedly closed down. Remittances from Jordanians working in the Gulf states - which once constituted 80 percent of foreign-currency income - have halted.\n``This is a bankrupt country,'' says an Arab diplomat.\nOn the other hand, as the raids against Iraq continue many Jordanians feel that King Hussein should take practical steps to help Iraq and some are even pressuring the government to engage actively in war.\nAccording to analysts, political enthusiasm for Iraq by far overrides frustrations at the rapidly deteriorating standard of living.\nAll sectors of Jordanian society and Palestinians in the refugee camps have engaged in the fund-raising campaign. Specifically, people are sending trucks of milk, flour, and medicine to Iraq, while Jordanian physicians are volunteering to serve in Iraqi hospitals.\nJordan's political groups and professional, students and women's unions, launched a series of solidarity activities with Iraq across the kingdom last week. Organizers said that demonstrations, sit-ins, fund-raising campaigns, and seminars will continue as long as the coalition forces bomb Iraq.\nAnalysts say the surge of pro-Iraq"}

It may only be used by patients in the forms such as vaporized flower or oil, gel caps, suppositories, patches, edibles or topical cream.\nSen. Davis said the medical cannabis will be tested by an independent testing lab to make sure it is safe and properly labelled.\nSupporters say a benchmark research poll shows 72 percent of South Carolinians support medical marijuana.

Respawn, now owned by EA after being acquired for $315 million, is currently developing three major games: a new war-based VR game, a narrative-driven third-person action Star Wars game, and Titanfall 3. Which one could be teased? We're hoping for the middle one.\nFollowing Battlefront II's big lootbox controversy and Visceral Games' closure and the cannibalization of its interesting-sounding Star Wars project (aka Project Ragtag) the Star Wars gaming market has been pretty slim. EA's exclusive license to make Star Wars games has been stretched out now that the timeline has been disrupted. Project Ragtag was to release in 2018, and Respawn's game was to launch in 2019 or 2020 (EA's FY2020 and FY2021, respectively). Considering the Star Wars game is Respawn's highest profile game in development it's possible we could get more concrete info about it at E3 2018. However the VR war game is to release in 2019...so it could be that too.\nIt's been a while since we last heard about Respawn's Star Wars game.\nWe know that it's a third-person action game with very heavy emphasis on characters, and that it'll follow true to the Star Wars universe while also exploring brand new territory.\n\"I would sacrifice visual fidelity for gameplay experience. It has to feel good. It has to play right. It has to be fun,\" Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella told Glixel in 2016.\nBut it's not all fun and games - we promise to pay respect to the Star Wars legacy at all times, a fact that will be constantly reinforced and honored as a central game design tenet. Fans should expect the exemplary level of quality first established at Respawn with Titanfall, a game that epitomizes our studio's dedication to slick, larger-than-life action and fun, groundbreaking mechanics.\nWe'll be making a third-person action/adventure game set in the Star Wars universe.\nAs a huge Star Wars fan I'm itching to play some quality narrative-driven RPGs...and I hope Respawn can deliver sooner than later.\nEA's big E3 showcase starts at 2PM EST tomorrow. Be sure to tune in for new info on something Respawn-related, Anthem, and Battlefield V (among others).\nBut, we figured out a juicy little tidbit to mention about 1 of the 3 projects tomorrow at #EAPlay2018 (@andrearene threatened to force something out of me)."}

It's not even pharmaceutical grade.\"\nOriginal item posted at 11:20 a.m.: We haven't been able to reach Sheffie Kadane this morning -- he's at a meeting in Arlington -- and his secretary says she's unable to access his schedule at the moment. So, long story short, we cannot confirm his advertised attendance at a meeting scheduled tonight at Winfrey Point at White Rock Lake on E. Lawther Drive. But it does sound very much like something up his alley: \"The Town Hall on Fluoridation.\"\nKadane, you may recall, believes Dallas needs to get the fluoride out of its water supply. He's said it a few times during recent council meetings, nodding along with he anti-fluoridation faction that keeps popping up to do a few sets at the open mic. The District 9 rep who's about to get term-limited out of out of office has fought against fluoride on two fronts: We don't need it, he insists, and we shouldn't be paying for it -- especially since adding more to the city's water supply runs around $600,000 annually.\n\u201cHave you seen toothpaste that has fluoride in the toothpaste?\u201d he asked Dallas Water Utilities officials in May. \u201cHave you read the disclaimer which says do not swallow, and if you do swallow this toothpaste go get your stomach pumped? And it\u2019s only on the fluoridated toothpaste.\u201d Anyway. We're not sure if he'll be there. But it does seem like his cup of non-fluoridated tea.\nBut we do know who will be there: Dr. Paul Connett, the executive director of the Fluoride Action Network and a former chemistry professor billed as \"one of the world\u2019s experts on Fluoride.\" He's certainly one of the most controversial, as evidenced by his brief entry on Quackwatch: \"Fluoridation is supported by major health organizations and government agencies throughout the developed world and has been listed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among the 20th Century's ten great public health achievements. But Connett would have you believe that fluoridation is ineffective, unsafe, and unethical. In effect, he would like you to believe that he's smarter than all of them put together.\"\nHe actually spoke to the council in June, where he was warmly greeted by none other than Sheffie Kadane. Their back-and-forth is below, beginning at the 3:40 mark. Just in case you can't make it tonight."}

The quid pro quo covenant seems to be broken. Consumers give data. Businesses get richer.

{"idx": "1206", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Recent studies of the whole human genome have proven that the entire population of Ashkenazi Jews in existence today descended from no more than 350 individuals who lived 800 years ago. The genetic similarities among members of this sect were found to be so acute that everyone in the community is, at the very least, the 30th cousin of everyone else. This level of consanguinity only occurs when a relatively small community is kept isolated for geographical or social reasons resulting in large scale and persistent in-breeding. Population bottlenecks such as this have been observed among the Finns, the French Canadians in Saguenay\u2013Lac-St.-Jean, and in orthodox religious groups such as the Amish and the Hutterites.\nCommunities with population bottlenecks are highly susceptible to genetic diseases. The Ashkenazi Jews, for instance, commonly suffer from Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis and Gauchers disease. Due to a historically high reproductive rate among the relatively small number of individuals that comprise the community, rare mutations that might have been dormant in founder individuals begin to express themselves over time among their descendants, with dramatically increased frequency the longer the community remains endogamous.\nMutations, of themselves, are not uncommon in the general population. When an offspring inherits a copy of a recessive gene from only one parent, it could go through its entire life without displaying any symptoms of the disease. It is only when a child inherits a copy of the same mutation from both parents that the disease surfaces. In communities with population bottlenecks, there is a significantly higher chance that both parents will carry the same recessive mutation.\nA number of inherited diseases have been identified to commonly exist in various Jewish communities such as the Ashkenazis. As abortion is generally unacceptable among orthodox Jews, prenatal screening is largely ineffective as a means to prevent affected foetuses from going to full term.\nTo work within these religious constraints, Rabbi Josef Ekstein, a New York Jew, established Dor Yeshorem in 1983. The organisation used genetic techniques to screen members of the Jewish community from as early as when they were in high school, hoping to identify those that carried recessive genes for Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis or Gaucher\u2019s.\nArmed with information about their own genomic mutations, these schoolchildren were now equipped to determine, even before they started dating, whether the offspring they might have with the persons they intended to date are likely to be afflicted with one of these diseases. As unromantic as this might sound, in communities with rigid religious and social norms, genetic matchmaking is perhaps the only way to avoid the proliferation of genetic diseases.\nIndia is home to more than 40,000 jatis as well as various other tribal groupings. Many of these groups follow, to this day, strict rules of endogamy that prevent them from, or at the least frown on, marrying anyone outside their group. We have only relatively recently begun to test these groups for genetic similarity.\nEarly results indicate that genetic differentiation between groups in India is likely to be as much as three times higher than differentiation within populations in Europe. This is a clear indicator of the existence of population bottlenecks in India similar to those among religious sects in the West.\nAs population bottlenecks are themselves indicators of genetic disorders, it stands to reason that the endogamous populations of India are likely to be rife with inherited diseases. However, as there has been little systematic research into identifying the genes responsible for disorders common to Indian"}

The official added that a small team found their quarry hiding in a large home in an affluent suburb of Islamabad. The raid occurred in the early morning hours Sunday.\nThe attacks a decade ago seemed to come out of nowhere, even though al-Qaida had previously damaged American targets overseas.\nThe terrorists hijacked planes, flew one of them into one of Manhattan's Twin Towers - and, moments later, into the other one. Both buildings collapsed, trapping thousands inside and claiming the lives of firefighters and others who had rushed to help them.\nA third plane slammed into the Pentagon, defacing the symbol of America's military night. A fourth crashed in rural Pennsylvania after passengers overpowered the hijackers and forced it down - before it could hit its intended target in Washington.\nObama struck a less than boastful tone in his brief announcement, although he said the death of bin Laden was \"the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaida.\nMoments after he spoke, American officials cautioned that the events could lead to heightened threats against the United States."}

During the debut episode, Russo talked about why Roman Reigns got booed at Royal Rumble 2015 and why Seth Rollins is not over with the fans.\nAccording to Russo, Reigns got booed out of the building at Royal Rumble 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because WWE unnecessarily put Daniel Bryan in the over-the-top-rope battle royal and Reigns was left in the match with other performers who had no chance of winning and going on to headline WrestleMania 31.\n\"It had a lot to do with putting Daniel Bryan in that match, which they didn't have to put him in, having him eliminated, leaving Reigns in there with three other guys that had no chance of winning the match, so they put Reigns in a horrible position. The people booed him out of the building.\" Russo continued, \"From that day on, from where I sit, my professional opinion is that the WWE has been catering to the internet, the internet wrestling community, the small audience with the loudest voice! Everything they said they weren't going to do, now they are doing. They are catering to that crowd, which they already have. The casual fans are no longer there.\"\nRusso claimed that during Attitude Era Vince McMahon instructed the WWE writing staff to ignore the IWC and focus on attracting casual viewers.\n\"I can remember back in the day working for the WWE, we were told to ignore the internet. 'Don't read what the internet is saying; that is the minority with the loudest voice; those are traditional wrestling fans that are going to watch the product no matter what'\", Russo added, \"The key to success is to go out and get those casual television viewers and make wrestling cool again. That's what the Attitude Era was all about.\"\nAlso, on the premiere episode of Nuclear Heat, Russo stated that Rollins is not over because his character has been written in such a way that makes it impossible for the audience to connect with him.\n\"Seth Rollins is a great wrestler, Seth Rollins is not over,\" Russo said. \"The reason Seth Rollins is not over is because creative has butchered his character. He [has] got more personalities than Sybil. One week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Dean Ambrose. The next week, he's running away. The next week, he's standing up to Triple H. There have been so many changes with this Seth Rollins, there is no way anybody in the audience can be emotionally attached to him.\"\nRusso went on to compare Rollins to WWE Hall of Famer, Shawn Michaels.\n\"[If] you want to see the difference in what I am talking about, go back to the Attitude Era and watch [when] Shawn Michaels was the [WWE] Champion.

But business optimism has taken a significant hit, according to the central bank\u2019s first quarterly business outlook survey of 2019, released Monday.\nVirtually all measures were weaker in the quarter, including sales growth, spending plans and hiring intentions, with many key readings slipping below their historical averages.\n\u201cThe main headwinds are a more uncertain outlook in the western Canadian energy sector, continued weakness in housing-related activity in some regions and tangible impacts from global trade tensions,\u201d the bank said.\nThe survey\u2019s composite indicator slipped to negative 0.64 in the first quarter, down from a positive reading of 2.31 in the final quarter of last year, according to the survey. The bank attributed this to lower demand in both Canada and in foreign markets.\nThe last time the survey was in negative territory was in the third quarter of 2016.\nEconomists said the survey results don\u2019t come as a huge surprise given the marked slowdown in the economy since the end of last year. The findings strongly suggest the Bank of Canada will leave its key rate unchanged at its next rate announcement on April 24, and perhaps do nothing through the rest of the year.\nOn the other hand, the central bank has shown no indication that it is considering a rate cut, analysts said.\n\u201cThe [survey] doesn\u2019t paint the picture of an economy falling off a cliff, but rather one dealing with a meaningful soft patch,\u201d Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said in a research note.\nThe more pessimistic business mood suggests the central bank\u2019s next rate hike is \u201ca lot further away than thought just a few months ago,\u201d said Royal Bank of Canada economist Nathan Janzen.\nThe business survey is typically the final piece of evidence that Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and his colleagues use to make their rate decisions.\nThe bank has raised its key interest rate, now at 1.75 per cent, five times since mid-2017. The last of those hikes was in October, 2018. Mr. Poloz and other bank officials have said they expect the economic slowdown to be temporary and that growth will pick up again in the second half of the year.\nThe composite indicator combines companies\u2019 responses to questions about investing, hiring, sales, inflation and capacity pressures.\nForty-five per cent of companies reported weaker sales growth in the past 12 months, compared with 39 per cent who experienced higher sales growth. Nonetheless, a slightly larger percentage (40 per cent) expect higher sales growth in the next year, compared with 34 per cent who expect slower sales growth.\nMeanwhile, 39 per cent of respondents said they plan to boost investment, compared with 19 per cent planning to cut spending.\nNearly half of companies plan to hire more workers, but that is down from the previous survey.\nThe share of companies reporting capacity pressures fell to 31 per cent \u2013 the lowest reading since 2015. There was also a sharp drop in the share of companies reporting problems finding workers.\nThe survey is based on interviews with executives from 100 companies, selected to roughly match the makeup of the Canadian economy.

The project involves sensors to be the \"eyes\" of a UA, the software to carry out manoeuvres and collision avoidance, and the aircraft themselves.\nPlans for UAs envision that a pilot will always be on the ground controlling them, but they must have on-board technology that can perform in an emergency - in the eyes of aviation law - as well as a pilot.\n\"These things are going to have a level of self-determinism, particularly if you ever lose the communication link with the ground control,\" said Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, Astraea project director. \"They've got to be able to operate fully safely and take the right decisions.\n\"But we're not talking about unthinking drones, we're not talking about irrational and unpredictable behaviour, and we're not talking about something that gets itself up in the morning, goes off and does its own things and comes home without any human oversight.\"\nThe project has the participation of major contractors including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Thales UK.

Jerusalem's Arab quarters would not be included in the autonomy nor would their residents be allowed to vote in the elections for the self-governing authority's administrative council or other institutions. 3. The autonomous administration would not be granted legislative or judicial powers. 4. All matters affecting military security would be the sole prerogative of Israel. However, a senior Israeli political source cited three areas in which Israel's position might be softened: a settlement freeze (unannounced, but effective) at least for the marathon's duration; allowing the autonomy institutions a say on security or military matters; and granting Arab Jerusalemites the right to vote in the autonomy without incorporating any part of the city within its geographical limits."}

Even here in the Cabrini-Green public housing project, a place that many Chicagoans regard as \"dangerous, with nightmarish criminality,\" as Fortino puts it, he felt a steadying happiness.\nHe loved the light in the sky. He loved the way the buildings muscled their way into that sky. And he loved walking through the buildings, seeing the way the light from the windows shed a casual radiance on ordinary objects such as doors and walls.\n\"I can walk into a housing project and be transported by the quality of the light,\" Fortino said. \"That's what got me through seeing the other things -- the things you associate with public housing: the way the light falls on the buildings.\"\nWhen it came time for him to undertake a project for his graduate thesis in photography at the University of Illinois at Chicago, then, Fortino knew his destination: Cabrini, where he had walked a beat since 1988.\nStarting last summer, Fortino began to take pictures of the front doors of Cabrini apartments.\n\"Doors have a psychological weight to them,\" he said in the quiet, understated way he talks about his work. \"It just seemed to make sense to me.\"\nInitially, he photographed doors here and there, when he found himself intrigued by a particular color or a smattering of graffiti. That approach troubled him, however; he wanted the project to be more systematic, to record the range of Cabrini thresholds, not simply his own tastes and whims.\nSo he selected a single building -- 911 N. Hudson St. -- and took pictures of all 48 doors in the six-story structure. \"I chose it because it was manageable,\" Fortino said. \"Some of the buildings are 19 stories, with 20 apartments per floor. That was too much.\"\nHe and a friend, Tom Nowak, who helped with the lighting, were careful to treat the doors identically, \"to maintain a consistent viewpoint,\" Fortino said. He set up his camera and tripod the same distance from each entryway.\nHe asked residents for permission to take the pictures; none seemed to care one way or another. \"We initiated conversations with women going in and out of the apartments. Instead of being curious about us, mostly they wanted to know why things weren't getting fixed like they ought to be.\"\nFortino knows that his access to Cabrini -- an area riddled with crime and gang violence -- is enabled by his profession.\n\"When I'm there, it is known that I am the police. We use that knowledge as protection,\" he said. \"I have a radio with me. I am armed. Tom wears a bulletproof vest.\" Without those preparations, \"We would be prey, rather than on an equal footing.\"\nWhen Fortino recently displayed the photographs for a committee of UIC professors, a requirement for graduate students in the School of Art & Design, the reaction was intense.

First and foremost, you should come in your team\u2019s apparel or not at all. Secondly, always throw your hat on the ice when someone scores a hat trick. Lastly, you should keep your heckling creative; no one wants to hear \u201cURI was my safety school\u201d four times.\nAlthough the Mullins Center is a slightly different experience than TD Garden, it\u2019s a close second. The beauty of attending games at the University of Massachusetts is that no one is invested in the fact that you may or may not be a Bruins fan, people are more preoccupied with the Minutemen placing the biscuit in the back of the opponent\u2019s net. UMass hockey fans also share one massive thing in common: As Gordie Howe once said, \u201cAll hockey players are bilingual. They know English and profanity.\u201d Howe clearly had the infamous student groups devoted to creating a lively student section\u2014the Sons of Liberty and the Militia\u2014in mind.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell which erupts the crowd more, freshman goaltender Matt Murray handing Northeastern its first shutout of the season or the notorious red-haired man feasting on a Big Y sub sandwich. The two student-section groups have brought both solidarity and comradery against our opponents in the Hockey East, leading the students in provocative chants, distributing fatheads of Coach Carvel and hosting special giveaways to incite a larger student presence at games.\nThe Sons of Liberty has turned Section Q into a comedic hub. Although they have no official affiliation with UMass or UMass hockey, their witty banter has truly added to the atmosphere of the student section; their commitment to \u201cuniting the masses\u201d is admirable. If you haven\u2019t been lucky enough to witness the Sons dousing themselves in blue Powerade or performing the \u201cCotton-Eye Joe,\u201d you\u2019re missing out. There is just something inspiring about the way they chant phrases like \u201cBU doesn\u2019t even have a campus\u201d at the top of their lungs and then slowly sit down and smile.\nBut where do these student groups draw the line when heckling goes too far? Before the upsetting loss to Boston University, I was able to learn how the Sons of Liberty felt about bigots in the stands. Sons Cam Cavagnaro and Jeff Polidor both shed light on how, when it comes to leading the crowd, they draw a line at violating serious boundaries\u2014as any true hockey fan would. In the short time I spent with them, it was apparent that they sincerely enjoy engaging the student section with their hysterical shenanigans.\nOn a more serious note, any true hockey fan knows that there are always people in the crowd who cross obvious boundaries when heckling. It\u2019s all a matter of keeping the crowd engaged and electrified without shouting racial slurs and politically incorrect terms. So yes, it can be stated that heckling does have boundaries. Given the nature of the game, it is more than acceptable to stir the pot, but there is never room for bigotry and racism.\nThis article is not only accurate but also the most well written and concise article on a very difficult subject matter in the entire publication..

This casual kitchen still life is the simple formula for a vinaigrette, a sauce so humble that it often doesn't seem like a sauce at all.\nBut it is: In French it's called la sauce vinaigrette. And a good one transforms a bowl of salad into something extraordinary. And it's not just for salads.

Just memorize this: 3 to 1. That's the classic proportion of oil to vinegar.\nBecause there are so few ingredients, their quality is important. Use the best oil and vinegar you can find, good sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper.\nThe only equipment you need is a whisk and a bowl. Whisk the salt and pepper into the vinegar first -- salt doesn't dissolve in oil, but it does in vinegar. Then whisk in the oil. That's a basic sauce vinaigrette.\nA classic vinaigrette is made with red wine vinegar and olive oil. Of course you can add to it: mustard or shallots or herbs or spices. And you can vary the kind of oil and vinegar -- using walnut or hazelnut oil, balsamic or white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar.\nBut you don't have to emulsify: Everything will combine when you toss the salad. Or if you're using the vinaigrette to sauce a plate that will receive a pristine sauteed fillet of Petrale sole, you might welcome the effect of the amber beads of olive oil eddying in the rosy vinegar, the oil and vinegar beading and traveling on the plate like a pointillist painting.\nDepending on the oil and vinegar you choose and your palate, you might want to depart from the basic 3-1 ratio. The vinegar, which is the acid component of the sauce, can vary in acidity from 4% to 8% or more.\nIf you use a high-acidity vinegar, you might want to move closer to 4 parts oil to 1 part vinegar.

I\u2019ve even had a few adventures in home wiring and and the occasional shock.\nBut of the dozens of products I\u2019ve tested, only a few have actually been ready for the market when they\u2019ve reached my hands. In a few cases this is to be expected: some were Kickstarter-backed projects that were shipping to the developers and reviewers at the same time and some were hitting my doorstep a month in advance of their availability in stores.\nBut others were shipping to the general backers or worse, in stores as I was testing my own versions of the products. And they just weren\u2019t ready.\nAfter two years of this, I think it\u2019s time the market and its participants stop shipping products that aren\u2019t up to snuff. Because as more people start picking up these devices and trying to see what the smart home is all about, a bad experience with an underperforming or buggy product is going to turn them off from the whole concept.\nTake for example, the Wink home hub from Quirky. This product launched in July with major backing from Wink and Home Depot. My guess is the companies involved felt the pressure to get into the market quickly since there were already several players ranging from small (SmartThings, Revolv) to big (Staples Connect and Lowes Iris) that had been selling for months and even years in the case of Lowes.\nBut when Wink launched, it was buggy, lacking support for basic devices that it shared radios and aisle space with, and consumers who picked it up were pretty frustrated. Luckily, it was cheap, and Wink had the cash to keep it in the market and manage its retailers\u2019 frustration with returns \u2014 a luxury smaller startups don\u2019t generally have. But still, any customer who decided to take a chance on Wink to see what the fuss was about wasn\u2019t likely to walk about thrilled with the smart home experience.\nWink wasn\u2019t ready for market. But what about LIFX, the $99 connected light bulbs that change color and connect via Wi-Fi? The bulbs were pricey, but since Philips Hue had primed the market, others were coming in with newer variations, and LIFX was winning accolades. But in July, after a few of my friends had picked up the bulbs, an English hacking firm reported that the bulbs exposed users to a significant security flaw by letting people hack into to users\u2019 Wi-Fi networks. Not only that, LIFX stored users Wi-Fi passwords all in one database. Both problems were quickly solved, but the exploit and the database setup exposed some basic flaws in how LIFX had handled security and notifications. Simply put, it wasn\u2019t ready.\nMy final beef with products that aren\u2019t ready concerns those companies that are pitching some type of algorithm as part of their value, but the algorithm isn\u2019t quite trained on enough data yet. Much like the vaporware of the 1990s, I think of these products as faithware, as in we just have to have faith that they\u2019ll work well and do what we want them to do.

If you\u2019re not home, you can get a message on your cellphone that there is a problem. In addition to smoke and carbon monoxide alerts, Birdi also tracks air quality of a home, watching for factors including humidity and dust.\nOther, more robust and individualized systems can do more.

Even more citizens could be encouraged to come forward to bring illegal immigrant relatives into the system, they said.\nThe fix is one of a number of recent measures by the administration that do not require the approval of Congress, designed to ease the effects on immigrant communities of contradictory or outmoded statutes. White House officials have been seeking ways to shore up sagging support for the president, particularly among Latinos.\nIn essence, officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services are proposing to change the procedures by which illegal immigrants with American family members apply for legal residency \u2014 getting a document known as a green card \u2014 allowing a crucial early step to take place in the United States rather than in the immigrant\u2019s home country.\nAlejandro Mayorkas, the director of the agency, said the purpose was to relieve burdens on citizens while also streamlining a convoluted, costly process.\n\u201cWe are achieving a system efficiency, saving resources for the taxpayers and reducing the time of separation between a spouse or child and the U.S. citizen relative,\u201d Mr. Mayorkas said.\nOn Friday the agency published a formal notice in The Federal Register that it was preparing a new regulation. But Mr. Mayorkas stressed that step was only the beginning of a long process the agency hopes to complete by issuing a new rule before the end of this year.\nThe applause from lawyers, Latinos and immigrant organizations was a strikingly different message than the administration has heard for many months.\n\u201cThis will open up a huge door to bring a large number of people into the light,\u201d said Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta who is a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Based on their caseloads and census data, lawyers estimate that many hundreds of thousands of Americans are married to illegal immigrants.\nThe new rule would make no change in the situation of illegal immigrants who do not have immediate American family members. White House officials acknowledge that there will be no progress before the November elections on legislation the president supports to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.\nUnder the law, American citizens are entitled to apply for green cards for immigrant spouses and children, even those who entered the country illegally. But the law requires most to return to their home countries to receive their visas.\nThe catch is that once the immigrants leave the United States, they are automatically barred from returning for at least three years and often for a decade, even if they are fully eligible to become legal residents.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services can provide a waiver from those bars, if the immigrants can show that their absence would cause \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to a United States citizen. But for the past decade, obtaining the waiver was almost as difficult and time-consuming as getting the green card.\nImmigrants had to return to their countries to wait while the waiver was approved. Waiting times extended to months, even years. Sometimes waivers were not approved, and immigrants were permanently separated from their American families.\nThe journey toward green cards for which they were eligible was so risky that many families simply decided to live in hiding and not apply.\nNow Citizenship and Immigration Services proposes to allow illegal immigrants to get a provisional waiver in the United States before they leave to pick up"}

But it's important to say up front that this is a nationally significant move and looks like an industry-leading step.\ninjecting meat chickens with antibiotics while still in the shell.\nThose restrictions mean the company has eliminated most of the uses of antibiotics that public health campaigners have been concerned about since the 1970s, and has gone beyond current federal requirements for what can be done to meat chickens before they hatch. And while the impact probably can't be measured with precision as long as other firms continue to use antibiotics routinely, it seems likely that Perdue has taken an important step in reducing the amount of antibiotic resistance that comes off farms and causes human illness.\nThe company said it began its antibiotic reduction program 12 years ago. The trigger for today's announcement was completing the removal of antibiotic use from its hatcheries, which was a five-year project that ended this summer.\n\"When we started hearing from consumers that they were becoming concerned about the amount of antibiotics used to raise chickens they were buying, we were listening,\" company chairman Jim Perdue said at the DC briefing. \"Coupled with information coming from the USDA and FDA and other sources, we began to look critically at our practices. It wasn't easy...but we found along the way that we could raise healthy chickens with fewer antibiotics.\"\nRoutine antibiotic use in meat production \u2013 that is, giving meat animals small doses of antibiotics every day in food or water, to make them put on weight faster and to prevent disease from the conditions they live in \u2013 has been under scrutiny for decades. The first federal action addressing it happened just last December, when the FDA asked veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers to relabel the antibiotics they make, so that \"growth promotion\" \u2013 that weight-gain use \u2013 would become an unapproved, technically illegal use of the drug.\nThe concern that lies behind routine animal antibiotic use is that most of the drugs used on farms are the same ones used against infections that humans develop. Bacteria in animals' guts or on their skin develop resistance to protect themselves; when the animals are slaughtered, or their manure washes or wafts off the farm property, the resistant bacteria go along too. When humans pick up those bacteria from meat or the environment, they can't be treated \u2013 because the drug needed to cure them is the same one that was used on the farm in the first place.\nThe \"ionophore exception\" is why the Perdue announcement and release today included words like \"fewer\" from Perdue himself, and statements like this from Dr. Bruce Stewart-Brown, Senior Vice President of Food Safety, Quality and Live Operations: \u201cBy no longer using any antibiotics in our hatcheries or any human antibiotics in feed, we\u2019ve reached the point where 95 percent of our chickens never receive any human antibiotics, and the remainder receive them only for a few days when prescribed by a veterinarian.\"\nStewart-Brown said during the briefing that the company's ionophore use is also trending down, but wasn't willing to give figures.

One solution: Matching customers with service reps for more harmonious calls.\nYou hear the recording whenever you phone customer support: \"Calls may be recorded for training and quality purposes.\" Of course, companies use call center recordings for training and compliance purposes, but they could do a lot more with this data.\nOr so says Jason Wesbecher, chief marketing officer of Mattersight, a Chicago-based developer of personality-based applications for call centers. The company\u2019s novel Behavioral Analytics software captures and examines a variety of contextual data, including voice calls from customers, to route callers to the best available representative -- at least from a personality-match standpoint.\n\"When you think of big data, there's a ton of data in that spoken conversation. No one is taking that data and trying to operationalize it in a new way,\" Wesbecher told InformationWeek in a phone interview. \"Call-recording vendors are out there, but they're not focused on this kind of behavioral science angle.\"\nMattersight's cloud-based analytics, based on millions of proprietary algorithms as well as a set of behavioral models, can determine if a caller is outgoing, sarcastic, serious, or shy, the company claims. Its software is used by major retailers and insurers, including CVS Pharmacy and Esurance, a division of Allstate.\n\"There are a quarter-billion phone calls every day between American brands and their consumers, so there\u2019s a lot of conversation happening,\" said Wesbecher. \"For our customers, we're applying psychology and behavioral science to the phone call, and we're able to tell them, across a vast set of data, the health of those customer conversations based on psychological and behavioral attributes.\"\nHere's how it works: Based on the words they use and how they use them, customers are classified within one of about a half-dozen personality constructs. This tells the company how the caller likes to communicate.\n\"What are their distress triggers? And what's the best way to de-escalate a situation they might be having, which in the call center business is really important right now,\" Wesbecher said.\nMattersight works with the call center in two ways. First, over a one- to two-week period, it captures key data patterns, including how individual call center reps handle certain personality styles.\nAcross a variety of phone calls, Mattersight identifies emerging patterns that indicate a service rep's ability to handle different personalities.\nThe company has a second product offering, where it comes in and looks at its client's historical call center data.\n\"We'll cross-reference it with our database of personalities and phone numbers,\" Wesbecher said. The goal is to pair two personalities -- caller and rep -- a match designed to generate shorter, more effective support calls.\n\"In this case, we don't actually present any information to the call center employee,\" said Wesbecher. \"We just create more magical connections by pairing, right when the caller calls in, that [customer] with the service rep.\"\nMattersight plans to extend its Behavioral Analytics software beyond the call center and into the world of social media.\n\"There are 150 million daily active users of Facebook in the United States and Canada, creating mountains of user-generated content every day,\" said Wesbecher. \"How can we take this behavioral profiling equation, and use it as an attribute for brands to better communicate, from an advertising standpoint, with the consumer on Facebook?\"\n"}

The bureau said such activity was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nSklyarov, who has been moved to San Jose, Calif., for trial, is the latest casualty in a fight between software maker Adobe and Elcom, a 20-person company in Moscow.\nThe jailed programmer is one of the authors of the Advanced eBook Processor, an application designed to strip various security measures from Adobe's eBook format, a function that Elcom claims is necessary to allow backups required by Russian law and that Adobe claims is tantamount to software piracy.\n\"Adobe would like to make great money on the eBook market but used an absolutely improper format for that: PDF,\" Vladamir Katalov, managing director of Elcom, said in an e-mail interview with CNET News.com. That's \"really nice, but not secure. And by pushing it, they simply create a lot of trouble (for) publishers and authors.\"\nThe jailed programmer Sklyarov had outlined problems with Adobe eBook and PDF security in a paper presented at the Def Con hacker convention.\nElcom's claim that the company had benign intentions is dodging the issue, said Adobe spokeswoman Susan Altman Prescott.\n\"The truth is that piracy is not a new issue, and copy protection of digital content is not a new issue,\" she said. \"No software on the market is 100 percent secure against a determined hacker. We are not new to this business. We understand the nature of copyright violation and how to prevent it.\"\nSklyarov's arrest comes three weeks after Adobe sent notices requesting that Elcom stop selling the program and demanding that Verio, Elcom's Internet service provider, disconnect the company's Web site.\nThe notice sent to Elcom on June 25 gave the company five days to remove the software from its site, but Verio removed the site the next day. While Elcom's Katalov said the company complied with Adobe's demands--selling fewer than 10 copies of its program before the software was pulled--its credit card service was soon suspended as well.\nOn June 26, according to the affidavit filed in the Northern District of California, Adobe requested an investigation by the FBI into Elcom's activities. After several demonstrations that the program did, indeed, remove the security of eBook files, FBI agent Daniel O'Connell filed his affidavit July 11, a day before registration opened at Def Con.\nAdobe, for its part, would not confirm its role in the investigation.\n\"The issue is not one of Adobe vs. a software hacker,\" said Adobe's Prescott. \"At issue is copyright protection for artists and publishers.\"\nWhile Prescott first portrayed Adobe as somewhat removed from the investigation, she later acknowledged that the company \"brought it to the attention of the U.S. government.\" The FBI affidavit, however, shows that Adobe seems to be the only victim in the case and had at least three people working on gathering information about"}

The move will save New York City inmates and their families an estimated US$8 million a year.\nUntil this law takes effect, phone services in the city\u2019s jails will continue to be provided by Securus Technologies which, like other private companies, charges inmates and their families, the ultimate \u2018captive customers\u2019, at higher than average rates.\nCurrently, Securus charges an initial fee of 50 cents, plus 5 cents per minute for calls within New York, as well as fees for depositing funds. The cost of calls can quickly become prohibitive. With black people and Latinos making up over 86% of inmates in New York City, communities of color primarily bear these high costs. Many already lived in poverty before their arrests, and are held in pre-trial detention simply because they cannot afford to pay bail.\nThe new law will also prohibit the city from making revenue for itself on phone call fees. City government had a revenue sharing agreement with Securus, which guaranteed the city at least $5 million in income each year.\nPhone calls provide an important link between people in custody and their families. Inmates that maintain family ties have an easier re-entry process, and may be less likely to reoffend. Children also benefit from having regular contact with parents in prison. The city should not look to raise revenues by charging people for these vital connections, nor should low income families be forced to sacrifice basic necessities to pay for calls.\nLast year, a court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission cannot set caps on the cost of in-state prison phone calls, leaving it to each state and local jurisdiction to set the fees. New York City is among the first jurisdictions to eliminate fees altogether, and prohibit revenue sharing contracts.

A new Stanford study explored the problem.\nThe holidays are a time of feasting for many people. You might be thinking fondly right about now of a fantastic meal from last week (prime rib, anyone?) or eagerly anticipating a quiet lunch of leftovers. Not so for cancer patients recovering from chemotherapy. Not only can the treatment lead to nausea, many patients also lose their sense of taste and struggle to eat enough to support their recovery.\nStanford stem cell biologist Philip Beachy, PhD, and instructor Wan-Jin Lu, PhD, wondered about the role of a critical developmental signaling protein called Hedgehog in this loss of taste. Previous work in Beachy's lab showed that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is often misregulated in cancers, and treatment of certain tumors involves specifically blocking the Hedgehog pathway. They published new findings on taste last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nLoss of taste sensation occurs in about 85 percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and is a significant clinical issue because it causes loss of appetite, unwanted weight reduction, and complications in recovery. In addition to the widespread loss of taste from traditional cancer therapy, a particularly interesting manifestation of taste disturbance occurs in cancer patients treated with Hedgehog (Hh) pathway antagonists, which our lab discovered and helped develop.\nOur sense of taste relies on taste receptor cells clustered in taste buds along our tongues. They're meant to let us know not just when things taste good, but also when something is spoiled or potentially toxic (no, I don't think you can count your cousin's noxious green bean casserole). Due to their role on the frontline of our digestive system, the taste receptor cells undergo a fairly high turnover rate -- dying and being replaced within a period of just a few days or weeks.\nThese taste receptors relay the taste information they sense to the brain via connections to a cranial ganglion (a cluster of nerve cells behind the ear). But information also flows in the other direction. In fact, it has long been known that the maintenance of the taste receptor cells requires this connection to the ganglion. Why this is hasn't been clear. Beachy and Lu studied laboratory mice to learn that drugs or genetic manipulations that block the response to the Hedgehog signal delivered by the nerves stops the regeneration of taste receptor cells, leading to an eventual die-off of the cells and a loss of taste.\nWe found that sensory organs critically rely on a signal, the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, that is delivered to the tongue epithelium by ganglion neurons that send projections from their cell bodies into the tongue. The pattern of the projections carrying the Shh signal provides spatial guidance for the regeneration of taste organs.\nChemotherapy patients do eventually regain their sense of taste after their treatment is stopped, but it can take several weeks. Beachy and Lu showed that administering drugs that amp up the Hedgehog pathway signaling in mice caused a much more rapid regeneration of the taste receptor cells on the tongue.\n\"Our findings illustrate a new biological principle, namely, that stable and robust organ patterning in tissues with a high rate of turnover can be specified by neuronal delivery of a regenerative signal to precise locations,\" Beachy told me. \"In addition, our findings suggest that pharmacologic Hedgehog pathway activation may provide"}

The company\u2019s executives pointed to signs of strength in the U.S. economy, as revenue rose in all three of Wells Fargo\u2019s primary business segments: community banking; wholesale banking; and wealth, brokerage and retirement.\nCEO John Stumpf, speaking on a conference call with investors, gave an overall upbeat assessment of the economy. He cited, among other things, consumer confidence being at its highest level since the recession.\n2. MORTGAGE LENDING STILL DOWN: Because it\u2019s such a large home-loan lender, Wells Fargo is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. housing market. Like other lenders, it continues to cope with overall lower mortgage originations following the drop in demand to originate refinancing loans.\nWells Fargo said it originated $44 billion in home loans in the fourth quarter, including those for purchases and refinancings, a decline of 12 percent from the same quarter a year ago. That\u2019s also down 8 percent from the third quarter of this year. To put that in some perspective, mortgage banking fees made up 15 percent of the bank\u2019s total fee income in the fourth quarter.\n3. LENDING PROFITABILITY SQUEEZED: Wells Fargo grew its total average loans by 4 percent from a year earlier and its average core deposits by 7.3 percent. All that deposit growth sounds good, but it has hurt the bank\u2019s net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability. The figure represents the difference between what a banks pays on deposits and receives for loans.\nThe net interest margin of a bank can shrink when deposits grow faster than loans. Sluggish loan growth and low interest rates have been squeezing net interest margins at banks.\nChief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said Wednesday that if Wells Fargo sees more high deposit growth and lending doesn\u2019t keep pace, more pressure will be put on the net interest margin.\n4. RESERVE RELEASES ARE FALLING: Wells Fargo, like other lenders, continues to rely less on using so-called \u201creserve\u201d releases as a tool to help boost its earnings.\nAs borrowers have done a better job of repaying loans, banks have been able to \u201crelease\u201d the money they\u2019ve set aside to cover bad loans. But the amount that banks are releasing continues to fall and it remains unclear whether they will be able to continue releasing reserves.\nIn the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo released $250 million, down from $600 million a year earlier. Shrewsberry said it\u2019s possible the bank could have more reserve releases in the future but also that it might need to do the opposite: add to its reserves to cover possible losses as it grows its loans.\n5. FALLING OIL PRICES NOT A CONCERN: Some analysts Wednesday asked Stumpf and Shrewsberry whether falling oil prices would hurt Wells Fargo.\nFalling oil prices have been good for consumers, lowering gasoline prices. But as oil prices have fallen, investors have wondered whether it could lead to losses on loans banks have made to the energy industry.\nStumpf said only about 2 percent of Wells Fargo\u2019s loans are tied to the oil and gas industry. He said the drop in oil prices is \u201ca real benefit\u201d to Wells Fargo\u2019s millions of customers.\nWells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S."}

Tents were invaded and in some cases set ablaze; al-Zein said he treated several patients suffering from smoke inhalation and a young girl with third-degree burns on her leg. By the time troops left, hundreds of males, including children as young as 13, had been rounded up and taken away for questioning.\n\"The situation was very bad,\" al-Zein told Al Jazeera. \"The refugees think the raids are unjust because they haven't done anything wrong.\"\nIN VIDEO: Will the war in Syria spread to Lebanon?\nAccording to the Lebanese army, the Arsal raids resulted in the arrest of 22 Syrian men suspected of involvement in attacks against the army - bringing the total number of Syrians detained in similar raids over the past two weeks to an estimated 450. Dozens more have reportedly been freed after interrogation.\nArsal is the first stop for many civilians fleeing Syria's three-year-old civil war, but its refugee camps have been badly damaged by the ongoing fighting, prompting refugees to seek shelter in the town itself. Last month, Arsal was the scene of a deadly spillover of violence, as clashes killed dozens and rebels captured a group of Lebanese soldiers.\nThe war in Syria has divided Lebanese citizens. Security is a top issue, with skirmishes along the border, and Lebanese residents have become increasingly anxious amid media warnings and rhetoric that paints Syrian refugees as a risk to be contained. Syrian detainees are often accused of either being members of groups such as the al-Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaeda wing fighting President Bashar al-Assad's regime, or supporters of those groups.\nPublic anger towards the Lebanese army's actions in Arsal is concentrated mostly in Sunni areas, especially in northern Lebanon. A demonstration was held in Tripoli last week to protest the army measures.\n\"Resentment here [is] starting to grow,\" said Khaldoun Taleb, the mayor of Fnaydeq, a Sunni town in northern Lebanon - although in general, he noted, residents support the army. \"About 3,000 of our sons are enlisted.\"\nTaleb cited a perceived double-standard with respect to Hezbollah, which sent its men to fight alongside Assad's troops, and Sunni fighters who support the Syrian opposition. Many in Fnaydeq who went to fight with the FSA were questioned by Lebanese army intelligence about their involvement in Syria, he said, while Hezbollah fighters freely cross official checkpoints to take part in battles alongside Assad's regime with no questions asked.\n\"We are starting to question why we are being treated differently,\" Taleb said.\nAmong those detained and later released in Thursday's raids was Syrian refugee Sleiman Khaled, who claimed he was blindfolded, beaten and interrogated by soldiers at an unknown location.\n\"They took all the men randomly,\" he"}

But it notes that, because there is no requirement on parents to register, the figure is an underestimate of the real total.\nThe figure represents a steep increase from a similar survey in 2015-16 that estimated about 37,000 school-aged children were registered as home educated.\nShan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said some local authorities had reported substantial increases \u201cof between 40% to 70% in recent years in the numbers of children electively home educated\u201d.\nOne local authority told the OSA it had received more than 1,000 new registrations in the course of the 2017-18 academic year, and said \u201cmany of these are instantly identifiable as inappropriate\u201d.\nCouncils reported that parents had a variety of reasons for home education, including the failure to secure a place at a preferred school. One local authority said that alone accounted for 9% of all home schooling decisions.\nBut \u201coff-rolling\u201d \u2013 the practice of a school shifting pupils off its rolls without using formal exclusion processes \u2013 was also said to be widespread.\n\u201cIn a story echoed by other local authorities, one said \u2018it is reported by parents that they have been coerced to become electively home educated\u2019 with some reported instances of schools preparing a standard letter for parents to sign advising of their intention to electively home educate,\u201d the OSA report says.\nScott added: \u201cI was told that that there tended to be an increase in moves towards elective home education during the key stage 4 years.\u201d Key stage 4 \u2013 years 10 and 11 \u2013 are when pupils study for and sit GCSE exams.\nThe OSA report is the latest evidence of increasing concerns over off-rolling, whether for behavioural or academic reasons. Earlier this week Ofsted announced it would use data to spotlight schools that appeared to be off-rolling pupils, with schools doing so at risk of being downgraded by inspectors.\nAn investigation by the Guardian found that a high-flying grammar school in Bromley, St Olave\u2019s, had been acting unlawfully by pushing out pupils in its sixth form whom it feared might not get top A-level grades and so damage its league table ranking.\nThe OSA also said parents opted for home education because of their child\u2019s anxiety or unhappiness at school, especially as a result of bullying, or concerns about the standard of education. Others said they did so because their child\u2019s special education needs were not being met.\nThe Department for Education last year called for evidence on home schooling practices, and is soon to publish guidance for parents and local authorities that may include compulsory registration.\n\u201cIt was clear to me that many local authorities believe that a requirement for home educating parents to register with the local authority would do much to safeguard children,\u201d Scott said.\nThe report also suggested grammar schools were still not doing enough to recruit pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, despite 118 selective schools now giving priority to pupils on free school meals in their admissions process"}

Nearly half (44%) of U.S. adults - 81 million people - were either underinsured or uninsured in 2010, up from 75 million in 2007 and 61 million in 2003.\nThe study finds that in addition to covering the uninsured, Affordable Care Act (ACA) reforms will also provide significant relief for those who are underinsured, potentially reducing their numbers by as much as 70 percent once the law is fully implemented.\n\"Under-insured families are at nearly as high risk as the uninsured because, while they have health insurance, holes or limits in their plans expose them to often unaffordable medical costs,\" said lead study author and Commonwealth Fund Senior Vice President Cathy Schoen. \"To reduce the number of under-insured, it will be critical for the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act reforms to keep deductibles and out-of-pocket costs low for essential, effective health care.\"\nAlthough insured all year, underinsured adults reported high rates of access concerns and financial stress. The study finds that the underinsured go without needed health care and struggle to pay medical bills or medical debt at rates at times similar to those without health insurance. Nearly half (46%) of underinsured and 63 percent of uninsured adults didn't fill a prescription, see a doctor when sick, or went without a recommended medical test or treatment, compared with 28 percent of people who had more adequate health insurance. Half (52%) of underinsured and 58 percent of uninsured adults had trouble paying medical bills, were contacted by a collections agency over unpaid bills, had to change their way of life to pay medical bills, or were paying off medical debt over time. In contrast, about one fourth (27%) of adults with adequate health insurance reported such medical bill stress and debt.\nThe study finds that Affordable Care Act reforms like premium assistance and reduced cost-sharing for lower and modest income families will provide significant support to those most likely to be underinsured - people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $56,000 a year for a family of four. Seven out of 10 of the underinsured, and a similar share of those uninsured during the year, had incomes this low in the study.\nThe new law will also provide sliding scale premium assistance to families making up to 400 percent of poverty or $88,000 a year for a family of four. However, the study notes that those with incomes above 250 percent of poverty ($56,000 for a family of four) could face out-of-pocket costs that are high relative to their incomes if plan designs permit high deductibles or high cost-sharing for essential care.\n\"Inadequate health insurance puts families' health and financial security at risk,\" said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis. \"The good news is that the Affordable Care Act includes provision to improve coverage for everyone. If plans are well-designed to cover high-value care, in the future families won't have to live in fear of paying for health insurance that won't protect them when sick - families, especially low and middle income families"}

Since then, we\u2019ve seen several iterations of their content strategy, from scale of funding to the nature of content, it\u2019s been a constantly changing vision. The launch of YouTube Red and YouTube Originals in October 2015 marked a public shift of YouTube\u2019s narrative, moving it closer to that of a media company, and we\u2019ve been witnessing an evolution ever since. The platform\u2019s success in its 10-plus years of existence can be summed up in its ability to reach the largest online audience with the widest range of content. From platform pioneers John and Hank Green to comedic powerhouses Rhett and Link to prolific gamer Markiplier to inclusivity advocate Hannah Hart, it isn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that there\u2019s something for everyone on YouTube.\nGiven their growing focus on \u201cpremium\u201d content, more akin to TV-style productions, YouTube\u2019s Brandcast, it\u2019s Newfront event, has become a larger-than-life showcase of YouTube\u2019s influence and reach.

The conspicuous absence of YouTube creators in the Originals lineup was met with skepticism and concern by many creators and users in the community. It has triggered discussions across creators about YouTube\u2019s changing focus and how it impacts them.\nToday, the highly competitive streaming arena is led by Netflix, followed by Hulu and Amazon, and YouTube is primed to become the next big player, as far as viewership goes.\nThe primary challenge with YouTube Originals is the inability to reconcile advertiser demand with user and creator interests. Reactions from users and creators across social media are reflective of this discord. YouTube\u2019s success is built on a vibrant creator ecosystem, sharing their authentic voices with an engaged audience. This two-way street is at the core of the YouTube experience for users, creators and brands alike.\nBrands like Squarespace, Audible, Sephora and Target have collaborated with creators to make effective campaigns that feel more personal and real than traditional celebrity endorsements. These collaborations have resulted in real upticks in brand awareness, recognition and ultimately sales. With Originals, brands are assured the comfort of familiarity, but it moves away from what makes YouTube standout in a busy content ecosystem.

For the little guy?\nSmall farmers hoping to carve out a living in a tough industry are increasingly relying on agritourists to pluck apples from their orchards and wander through their corn mazes \u2014 and then post the sort of just-so photographs that will draw more tourists to the country.\nPhu Mai, a marketing specialist with the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, says 287 of the state\u2019s 7,755 farms are offering up some kind of agritourism now \u2014 hay rides, petting zoos, or cider donuts. And the payoff is pretty good: about $12 million in annual revenue. Growth is strong, too. Between 2007 and 2012, the most recent data available, Massachusetts farmers saw a 125 percent increase in agritourism.\nSauchuk Farm in Plympton has taken a healthy slice of that growth. \u201cPeople love to take pictures and post to social media,\u201d says Scott Sauchuk, who started the farm about 18 years ago. His website is filled with photos of toddlers sidling up to pumpkins and parents playing a game called \u201cBarnyard Basketball\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s rows of amusement-park-style hoops made for rapid-fire shooting.\nAnd that\u2019s just a small sampling of the kid-friendly, Instagrammable entertainment at the farm. There\u2019s also a 100-foot-long zip line, a car in the shape of a cow, a little roller coaster, a sandbox, a slide, jumping pillows, and fruit-firing guns known as apple blasters.\nJimmy Hunt, a sixth-generation farmer at Hunt Farm, a dairy outfit in Orange, rented a GPS and spent about 25 hours cutting a corn maze to attract visitors. An aerial view, posted on his Facebook page, reveals the words \u201cHunt Farm, Dairy Divine, Since 1879,\u201d built into the sprawling pattern.

What can they and their veteran colleagues do to ensure we have fairer elections?\nOne of the singularly significant things they could do would be to follow the lead of some other states and vote to give Illinoisans a chance to approve the creation of an independent redistricting commission.\nOne of the overlooked stories of last week\u2019s election is that voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado and Utah approved independent redistricting in their states. Earlier this year, Ohio voters approved a question requiring new maps to garner bipartisan support to be enacted.\nIn Michigan, a nonpartisan group of citizens that led an effort called \u201cVoters not Politicians,\u201d first collected more than 425,000 signatures to get a proposition on the ballot that was overwhelmingly approved last week. More than 61 percent of voters approved of taking away the power to draw legislative and congressional maps from state lawmakers, according to Ballotpedia. Instead, Michigan voters gave the power to a 13-member commission composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five independents. A majority of that commission can approve the maps after the 2020 census.\nImagine this happening here: It all started with a Facebook post after the 2016 election by 29-year-old Michigan voter Katie Fahey and grew into a multimillion-dollar volunteer effort.\nThere, Republicans in the majority drew the last maps.\n\u201cA key selling point of the proposal has been that it would take the drawing of maps out of the backrooms and in to the light of day, with ample opportunities for the public to have input through commenting on proposed district maps,\u201d reported the Detroit Free Press.\nIn Missouri, nearly 62 percent of voters approved Amendment 1, which made changes to redistricting, lobbying laws and campaign finance limits for legislative candidates, according to Ballotpedia. Now, a nonpartisan state demographer will draw district lines guided by \u201cpartisan fairness and competitiveness.\u201d Existing commissions for the state House and Senate already can propose changes that adhere to the fairness guideline, but those must be approved by a 70 percent vote of those commissions, according to KMOV4.\nAfter our record-setting, multimillion-dollar governor\u2019s race and some multimillion-dollar legislative races, you might be curious about the campaign finance limits approved in Missouri. Senate candidates cannot receive more than $2,500 per person per election cycle, while House candidates cannot accept more than $2,000 per person per cycle.\nCurrently, Democrats hold the majority in the House and Republicans hold the Senate majority in Colorado.\nIn Utah, just more than 50 percent of voters approved an independent redistricting commission appointed by the governor and legislative leaders, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. A bipartisan \u201cBetter Boundaries\u201d group argued voters should pick their politicians.\nIt seems like such a logical concept, but here, and in a majority of states, one political party or the other within the legislature draws maps, often behind closed doors, following each census.

Liebling issued that warning some decades ago about the corrosive effect of media monopolies on the First Amendment, media ownership was a great deal more varied than it is today.\nEven then, it was far more concentrated in a few hands than when the Bill of Rights was written, when \u201cthe press\u201d was a low-capital venture, and newspapers were easily launched by those who had something to say. The founding fathers hardly anticipated today\u2019s media market, in which journalism is a vehicle for mega-corporate profits, and the diversity of opinion implied in the First Amendment is threatened less by a king or the state and far more by the motives of media barons.\nNowadays, media mega-mergers are the rage, and the Bush Administration is determined to remove legal barriers to media conglomeration that long have prevented a few giant corporations from controlling all of print and broadcast journalism. But can we count on the very news organizations whose owners are zealously pursuing profit from those mergers to also objectively cover the implications of media concentration for a free society?\nThe initial signs aren\u2019t promising. When America Online purchased Time Warner in the biggest media merger in US history, there was considerable analysis of the deal\u2019s business aspects but meager attention to implications for a representative democracy of having a significant portion of its media controlled by one corporation.\nPreviously, one could assume that Time magazine, AOL and CNN, as well as other parts of the new conglomerate, at least reflected the voices of different owners, but that\u2019s no longer the case. Also, with that merger, AOL went from being an outsider company demanding open access to cable to being the second-largest cable operator. Suddenly it muted its open access demand, leaving the perception that the news outlets now assembled under the AOL banner might also have had a change of heart as to what\u2019s important in the cable controversy.\nMost recently, the new Bush FCC appointees relaxed a long-standing \u201cdual network rule\u201d barring one television network from buying another. The result is that Viacom, which owns CBS, will have a large stake in the UPN network. Will other broadcasters anticipating similar deals permit their news organizations to voice dissenting opinions, or launch investigations of the FCC\u2019s abandonment of its consumer watchdog role?\nMeanwhile, Rupert Murdoch has made clear his intention to purchase DirecTV from General Motors. If he succeeds, he\u2019ll combine the largest US satellite broadcaster with his existing satellite network, which is pervasive in much of the rest of the world. Will journalists laboring in his vast empire dare raise troubling questions about the danger of one man holding such overwhelming power in the world communications market?\nFurther, Bush\u2019s new FCC chairman, Michael Powell, promises to eliminate the 1975 prohibition against cross-ownership\u2013a company owning a TV station and newspaper in the same market. That might prove immensely profitable to the Tribune Co., which, in purchasing the Times Mirror Co. last year, acquired newspapers in three markets where Tribune already owned television stations.

Then she switched to playing that role for Obama.\nWhile Hillary\u2019s email scandal broke, Tanden was in charge of the Center for American Progress, a radical left-wing group that had been described as \"Obama's Idea Factory.\" And she was chatting with John Podesta, the top Clintonite who had founded CAP. Podesta had co-chaired the Obama-Biden Transition Project. Neera Tanden would co-chair the Hillary-Kaine Transition Project under Podesta who headed up Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign. Podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through Obama and Tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under Hillary.\nAnd what did they think of Hillary? Did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing?\nSince the early days of the email scandal, we\u2019ve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence. The issue was a non-issue, Clinton surrogates were quick to assure us. And even if it was, no one did anything wrong. The flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall.\nAway from the cameras and the briefings, the Clintonites held their bosses in contempt. Neera Tanden, a supposed close associate of Hillary, blasted her instincts as \u201csuboptimal\u201d and described her as suffering from a character problem. And there was never any doubt as to what was going on.\nTanden ridiculed Cheryl Mills for the mess. Mills fired off an email to Podesta warning that Obama\u2019s denial wouldn\u2019t hold up. \u201cWe need to clean this up -- he has emails from her -- they do not say state.gov,\u201d she warned.\nObama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media. The revelation that Hillary had emailed Obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied. But meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address, he didn\u2019t know that it was illegal. This put his lie in line with Hillary\u2019s lie.\nThere was only one problem.\nBut that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know. That is what the leaked emails have begun doing. They are establishing that the Sergeant Schultz defense is utterly hollow.\nCheryl Mills knew. John Podesta knew. Barack Obama knew. And Hillary Clinton knew.\nWhen Obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from Hillary, Mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight. And his people did. That makes Obama complicit before and after the fact. He knew what Hillary was doing when she was doing it. And his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward, not just to protect her, but to protect him.\nHillary Clinton was not a rogue actor. She was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency. Even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history.\nBizarre administration email dodges included EPA boss Lisa Jackson using Richard Windsor as her alias. Jackson/Windsor left the EPA and took a seat on the board of the Clinton Foundation.\nTanden and Podesta didn\u2019t take issue with Hillary Clinton breaking the law, but with her clumsy political instincts, her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as Obama.

But the truth is much more complicated, said Allison Daley, the study's co-author and a Burlington, Ont.,-native working on her PhD at Sweden's Uppsala University.\n\"Back when he found them, he thought they were all separate animals and gave them separate names,\" said Daley.\n\"It was only when my co-author, Desmond Collins, did collecting in the '80s and '90s that he discovered that all these different parts ... were actually different parts of just one animal, the hurdia animal.\"\nOnce Collins and Jean-Bernard Caron \u2014 both of the Royal Ontario Museum and the other Canadian co-authors of the study \u2014 started assembling these pieces, it became clear that they were looking at a creature unlike anything they had ever seen.\nIt has a pair of tiny claws on its head that likely were used to shovel food into its large and toothy mouth, similar to another group of predators from that time, of the genus A nomalocaris.\nBut its most distinct feature is the shell, or carapace, jutting from the front of its head. While crustaceans often have shells to protect the soft parts of the body, the H urdia shell is empty.\n\"It's very odd,\" Caron told CBC News. \"We don't understand the connection of this part to the rest of the creature very well.\"\nCaron said the carapace likely slowed the creature down, leading it to probably spend most of its time feeding closer to the sea floor.\nAlso contributing to the study were Graham Budd of Uppsala University and Gregory Edgecombe of the Natural History Museum in Britain.\nThe Burgess Shale, located high in the Rocky Mountains, has provided paleontologists with a treasure trove of fossils from about 505 million years ago.

Merchants also weren\u2019t asking customers if they qualify for a discount at the point of sale.\nLarky\u2019s app gives users a consolidated view of all their memberships and, using GPS coordinates, sends a push notification to users\u2019 phones when they\u2019re near a member discount.

Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied he had assaulted her or anyone.\nPresident Donald Trump has urged the full Senate to approve his nominee.\nThat vote is expected next week. Republicans currently have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but a number of senators on both sides are said to be undecided.\nJudge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come.\nFor this reason, Republicans accuse the Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation until after the mid-term elections in November when they hope to win enough seats to stop it altogether. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of trying to \"railroad\" the process.\nThe Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life - appointed for life, its nine members have the final say on US law.\nThis includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy.\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was believed to be wavering, issued a statement shortly before the committee began sitting on Friday morning stating that he would back Judge Kavanaugh.\nOn his way to the committee room following the release of the statement, he was berated by two women who said they were victims of sexual violence and urged him to change his mind.\nAs the committee began, the bitter political divide was clear as an attempt by Democrats to call a further witness - Mark Judge, who Dr Ford said was present during the alleged sexual assault - was defeated by the 11 Republicans voting against the 10 Democrats.\nA subsequent motion to move to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was passed despite vocal Democratic objections. Some Democratic senators refused to vote on that and walked out of the hearing.\nIn a letter after Thursday's hearing, Robert Carlson, head of the American Bar Association - the body representing US lawyers and students of law - urged a delay of the vote to enable the FBI to check the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.\nThe association had previously supported Judge Kavanaugh for the role.\nWhat did Christine Blasey Ford say?\nThursday's hearing, which lasted for nine hours, brought an outpouring of support for Dr Ford - a university professor - from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.\nPrior to Thursday, no-one had heard from the 51-year-old publicly since the allegations arose.\n\"I am here today not because I want to be,\" Dr Ford said. \"I am terrified.

It's also a big deal for Infiniti's global ambitions.\nNissan's (NASDAQOTH:NSANY) luxury brand Infiniti this week gave the world more details about its intriguing Q50 Eau Rouge, a concept version of a high-performance luxury sedan.\nAnd those details got the world's attention.\nInfiniti had shown off the outside of the Eau Rouge in Detroit in January. But at the Geneva International Motor Show this past week, things got really interesting when the company unveiled the Eau Rouge's engine, one that came straight out of Nissan's GT-R supercar: a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 making a whopping 560 horsepower.\nThat's big-league power. That's comparable to Cadillac's mighty CTS-V and BMW's (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) all-conquering M5, two of the fastest sedans ever built -- and it makes a serious statement about where Nissan is taking its luxury brand. Just as General Motors (NYSE:GM) is making a big push to turn Cadillac into a global luxury brand, Nissan is doing much the same with Infiniti.\nAnd as Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this video, a decision to build the Eau Rouge with that tremendous V6 would instantly bring a lot of car-enthusiast credibility to Infiniti's efforts, and it could end up serving as a much-needed flagship for the brand.\nJohn Rosevear: Hey Fools, it's John Rosevear. When we talk about automakers and profits these days, we often talk about luxury cars. Globally speaking, luxury cars are a fast-growing business, in part because of a boom in demand in China, and since they tend to be higher-profit products than mainstream vehicles, we've seen several automakers push to expand their luxury offerings.\nThe most visible one for us here in the U.S. has probably been Cadillac, GM has made huge strides in its effort to put Cadillac on the level of BMW and Mercedes, but there's a similar effort under way at Nissan. Nissan is spending big bucks to turn its Infiniti brand, which was originally launched as kind of a me-too imitation of Toyota's (NYSE:TM) Lexus for the U.S. market, they want to turn Infiniti into a global luxury-vehicle powerhouse. Infiniti has a slew of new models under development, and Nissan has big plans to greatly expand the brand's presence in China and Europe, right in BMW's backyard.\nTheir latest move was revealed this past week at the Geneva International Motor Show, it's the Infiniti Q50 Eau Rouge sedan.

{"idx": "1322", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is facing a mounting tangle of potential legal troubles arising from his business dealings with foreign entities and his interactions with both executive branch and congressional investigators.\nOne set of problems stems from Russia. In 2015, Russian-linked companies paid Flynn more than US$65,000, including about US$45,000 from the state-backed Russian television network RT for a December trip to Moscow, where he delivered a speech and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner.\nIn December, a US wiretap of the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, intercepted conversations he had with Flynn discussing the Obama administration's imposition of sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election.\nThe other set stems from Turkey. Last year, Flynn's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid more than US$500,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch corporation. Inovo is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-American businessman with ties to the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\nThe work centred on research to discredit Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, and whose extradition Erdogan has been seeking.\nRobert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. But in a letter to the Senate this week, Kelner and other lawyers portrayed Flynn as being treated unfairly, saying he was \"the target on nearly a daily basis of outrageous allegations.\"\nHere is a breakdown of some of the possible legal problems for Flynn.\nInvestigators are scrutinising whether several of Flynn's statements violated a statute that makes it a felony, punishable by five years in prison, to make a false statement to the government. To convict, prosecutors must prove that the violation was knowing and willful, not merely inadvertent.\nIn January 2016, Flynn, a former three-star general who retired in 2014 after being forced out as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, applied to have his security clearance extended. As part of the process, he filled out and signed a SF-86 form. It directed him to disclose his foreign travel, compensation and contacts.\nIt also referred to the false-statement statute as part of a certification that the information was truthful and complete.\nAfter viewing the form, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Flynn had concealed his Russia trip and the compensation when he filled it out.\nIn February 2016, investigators reviewing Flynn's application to renew his security clearance interviewed him. According to a letter this month from Cummings, documents suggest Flynn falsely stated in that interview that US companies had funded his Moscow visit and that he had only \"insubstantial contact\" with foreigners, despite the dinner with Putin.\nFlynn's legal team has said he briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the trip. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, also failed to mention encounters with Russian officials on their SF-86 forms.\nSeparately, four days into the Trump administration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in December.

Brown won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series. And at the Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Oprah Winfrey and Morgan Freeman were given honorary awards respectively. But that\u2019s about it.\nAt the Oscars, some of the nominees included Denzel Washington and Daniel Kaluuya for Best Actor, and Octavia Spencer and Mary J. Blige, both for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Granted, this was an especially unpredictable year but none of the aforementioned actors prevailed with a golden statue. While Peele made history for winning Best Original Screenplay, he did not win in the coveted Best Director category in which only four black men have been nominated in 90 years \u2014 none of whom have won. Mudbound director Dee Rees joined the list of black female directors who didn\u2019t even get nominated in the category despite having her film recognized for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actress (Blige). Tiffany Haddish was overlooked altogether for her hilarious comedic performance in Girls Trip, unlike Melissa McCarthy for her role in Bridesmaids, widely categorized as Girls Trip\u2019s white-counterpart film.

If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11.\nRosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck.\nIn late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions.\nPhilae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long (4 kilometer) comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars.\nThe European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles (6 billion km) to reach the comet.\nOne major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets \u2014 considered one of the building blocks of the solar system \u2014 are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun.\nPredicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface."}

However, following NBC News\u2019s release yesterday of a Justice Department white paper that outlines the administration\u2019s legal justification for conducting drone strikes against Americans suspected of terrorism, Brennan\u2019s nomination is quickly morphing into a showdown over the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy. Now the New York Times has added more fuel to the controversy, revealing that the United States has a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia that\u2019s used to conduct strikes in neighboring Yemen.\nThe Saudi base, which was constructed two years ago, was first used to launch the drones that killed American-born Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki. Though much of the debate has focused on the targeting of U.S. citizens, only four Americans have been killed in U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002. By comparison, at least 24 people have already been killed by U.S. drones in Yemen this year, and since the campaign started more than 3,000 militants and civilians have been killed in strikes in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nAs the the White House\u2019s chief counterterrorism adviser, Brennan is the main coordinator of the terrorist \u201ckill list\u201d and oversees the drone strikes conducted by both the military and the CIA. Brennan was previously the CIA\u2019s station chief in Saudi Arabia, and urged the Obama administration to take the threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s Yemen affiliate, more seriously.\nInterestingly, some journalists have known about the \u201csecret\u201d Saudi base for some time. The Washington Post says it didn\u2019t disclose the location at the administration\u2019s request, but it \u201clearned Tuesday night that another news organization was planning to reveal the location of the base, effectively ending an informal arrangement among several news organizations that had been aware of the location for more than a year.\u201d The Post reports that it\u2019s just one of a \u201cgrowing constellation of drone bases\u201d operated by the U.S. overseas.\nFor years, critics of the drone campaign have been calling on Obama to make good on his pledge to have the \u201cmost transparent administration in history,\u201d and with Brennan\u2019s nomination, now they feel they finally have a bit of leverage. As Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee, told the Post, \u201cIf the Congress doesn\u2019t get answers to these questions now, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get them in the future.\u201d It sounds like Brennan\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday is going to get ugly."}

Investors should not worry about the somewhat strange ticker symbol for the Makita shares trading as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR); the stock provides solid, if cyclical value.\nMakita is best known for its hand power tools, and those tools generated more than 70 percent of the company's sales. The balance of sales is split between garden and household power products and replacement parts sales. Europe is Makita's biggest market, with 42.5 percent of sales in the latest fiscal year. Japan provided 17 percent of sales and North America accounted for just 13.6 percent. The rest of Asia, South America, Africa, and the Middle East produced the remaining 27 percent. Makita is truly a global company, headquartered in Japan.\nThe company's results were affected by the economic slowdown and reduction in construction activity. Total revenues declined for the fiscal years of 2009 and 2010 before rebounding in fiscal year 2011, which ended in March. Annual revenues increased by 11 percent over the previous year and net income per share grew by 34 percent.\nThe first quarter of Makita's fiscal 2012 saw revenues increase by 17 percent and net income per share jumped by 56 percent. A portion of the strong growth numbers is due to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan in the spring. The company has forecast second quarter revenue and income growth in a 12 percent to 15 percent range.\nMakita is not followed by Wall Street and just 3 percent of the company shares are held by U.S. institutional investors. However, the stock has produced significantly better historical performance than rival Black & Decker.\nAt the time this article was written, MKTAY was up 14 percent from the previous year and SWK was down by the same amount. Over a three year period Makita had outperformed its rival 60 percent to 6 percent.

His novels include the Edgar Award-winning La Brava, Out of Sight and numerous stories turned into big screen movies Get Shorty and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown.\nThe latter tale, adapted from Leonard's Rum Punch, appeared perfect for Tarantino in his post-Pulp Fiction era, and he cleverly cast Pam Grier - the star of Coffy and Foxy Brown - in the lead role.\nIt's supporting cast including Robert De Niro, Samuel L Jackson, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton, though Grier and Robert Foster were the real treats. Jackie Brown revitalized both actors' careers, with the former landing a Golden Globe nomination and the latter scoring an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\nAfter the success of Pulp Fiction, Tarantino and his long-time producer Roger Avary - presumably armed with a little more cash - acquired the film rights to Leonard's novels Rum Punch, Freaky Deaky and Killshot.\nThe director originally set about adapting one of the latter two, leaving Rum Punch to another director, though he was said to have fallen in love with the novel and penned the screenplay, renaming it Jackie Brown.\nTarantino changed the ethnicity of the main character from white to black, renaming her Brown, from Burke. Nervous about presenting the changes of Leonard, the pair finally spoke to the author shortly before the first day of shooting, though the novelist apparently loved the screenplay and - reportedly - called it the best work he had ever read.\nThe book - and movie - followed a flight attendant who smuggles money from Mexico to the United States to make ends meet. She works for a black-market gun runner (played by Samuel L Jackson in the movie).\nWhen the runner discovers that one of his other couriers has been arrested - and will speak to the police to avoid jail time - he arranges for his bail with his bondsman (Forster) and promptly goes to work on the rat.\nThe critics were enamoured by the movie, \"The tale is filled with funny, gritty Tarantino lowlife gab and a respectable body count, but what is most striking is the film's gallantry and sweetness,\" said Newsweek.\n\"Quentin Tarantino puts together a fairly intricate and relatively uninvolving money-smuggling plot, but his cast is so good that you probably won't feel cheated,\" said the Chicago Reader.\nTime Out called it, \"Tarantino's finest, most mature movie to date,\" while Entertainment Weekly described Jackie Brown as \"a scuzz-bucket film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick at his most static-mesmeric.\"\nIt was a tough gig for Tarantino to do something fresh after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and the critical vultures were circling when the director pulled in the A-list names for Jackie Brown.

LOUIS \u2013 The question has been asked so many times over the past 16 months of this presidential election that it has become a cliche: Has anyone ever seen anything quite like this? And yet, once again, Donald Trump took Campaign 2016 to places no one could have imagined when it all began.\nIn the wake of the release of an 11-year-old video of Trump speaking of actions that, if carried out, would amount to sexual assaults of women, the Republican nominee may have stepped back, issued another apology and tried to keep his demeanor in his exchange with Hillary Clinton as restrained as possible. He chose to do otherwise.\nIt\u2019s not that serious issues were not addressed and at times serious disagreements aired, whether it was over the Affordable Care Act or the state of U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama. But never has there been a debate in which the attacks, the body language or the exchanges conveyed the degree to which this campaign has reached the depths of division and disagreement, not just between the two candidates but between two Americans.\nMost of the fireworks took place in the first half of the debate. By the second half, the personal insults receded slightly and it was during these exchanges that Trump sought to press his case that Clinton is a symbol of a failed status quo and that he offers not only alternate policies but also would blow up that status quo with an entirely different style of leadership.\nThose are the arguments that Trump hopes will motivate enough fed-up voters to give him the presidency. They also could make some Republican leaders think twice before they leave him. If he accomplished that, then the night can be counted as partially successful for him.\nThat means it won\u2019t just be reaction to Trump\u2019s performance in the debate that will affect the campaign coming days. Voters will continue to draw their conclusions about his fitness to serve as president apart from how he looked and sounded on the stage here in St. Louis. And while a rebound is possible, further slippage, or even status quo, could prove political fatal, given the precarious state of his candidacy.\nMeanwhile, Republican elected officials will make their own assessments of his and the party\u2019s future in the context of the lewd video -and everything else they have endured from Trump both before and since he became their presidential nominee. In the hours before the debate, the list of GOP officials abandoning him continued to grow, and there\u2019s little reason to doubt some continuation in coming days.\nSome Republicans are saying publicly that recapturing the White House is a lost cause, that Trump is so weakened that it\u2019s too late for him to repair the damage. Their goal will be to protect their majorities in the House and the Senate. But their efforts are likely to intensify a growing civil war within the GOP \u2013 as the hostile reaction by Trump loyalists to some of those who split with him underscored.\nThe final presidential debate won\u2019t come for more than a week \u2013 Oct. 19 in Las Vegas. But its significance could pale in comparison to what happens in the days immediately ahead. Events are moving far too quickly and the stakes \u2013 for Trump personally and for the Republican Party \u2013 far too large for anyone to wait.\nPublished: Oct. 9, 2016, 8:57 p.m."}

After wining five in a row Bnei Yehuda has lost two and drawn one of its last three premier league games. Betar has now overtaken its Sunday night opponents and is third in the table, equal on points with Hapoel Tel Aviv, but behind the second-place team on goal difference. Betar dominated Bnei Yehuda for the entire first half and was only eventually slowed down by midfielders Maor Melikson's being sent off at the start of the second half. Bnei Yehuda, which was hosting Betar at its homeaway-from-home in Herzliya, missed its real home, Bloomfield Stadium, whose pitch is being resurfaced. The hosts couldn't take advantage of their one-man advantage and, despite creating numerous chances, didn't manage to equalize. Betar began the game well and seized the initiative from the first whistle. Ten minutes from the start striker Lior Asulin found himself totally free five meters from Bnei Yehuda's goal, but his awful shot went well wide of the mark. The hosts briefly breathed a sigh of relief, but two minutes later they were one goal down. Striker Jeff Tutuana's header was well saved by keeper Vincent Enyema, but Asulin easily headed the rebound in from the goal line. Betar continued to press forward and was rewarded with a second goal. Melikson dribbled his way into Bnei Yehuda's penalty box and passed the ball to Omri Afek whose powerful shot was deflected into the goal leaving Enyema helpless. Bnei Yehuda was fortunate to end the half only two goals behind. Thirty seconds into the half the hosts got on the board. Midfielder Asi Baldot was free inside Jerusalem's box and easily headed the ball from the corner into the net. Less then a minute after conceding the goal, Betar reclaimed its two-goal lead. Midfielder Barak Itzhaki ran clear of the Bnei Yehuda defense and beat the keeper with an accurate right-footed shot. The incidents kept coming and moments after scoring the goal, Betar found itself one man down. Melikson celebrated his team goal by jumping on the Stadium fences and, after receiving a yellow card earlier in the match, the referee had no choice but to show Melikson a second yellow and send him off. Bnei Yehuda pushed forward searching for goals, but couldn't beat the Betar defense until substitute Eli Biton scored in the 90th minute."}

If Casselberry city government is to be more than a sniping ground for egos, Mr. Glascock must be replaced in next week's election, and the best choice is Owen Sheppard.\nThe Orlando Sentinel also believes that the best choices for the two council seats on the ballot are the incumbents, Al Harmon and Tom Embree.\nOn paper, Mr. Glascock, 57, makes a good mayor. In the Army he rose through the enlisted ranks into the officer corps and retired as a lieutenant colonel. Since he came to Casselberry in 1969 and opened a hardware store, he has served on a long list of city and civic boards. And, no question, he has the best for his city at heart.\nHis record, though, fails to back up the paper. While council members are not blameless for the city's current troubles, the mayor goes out of his way to fuel the conflict. He dabbles with too much detail, undercutting department heads. He talks about cooperation, but then procrastinated after the council voted this year to join a fire-rescue first response program with neighboring cities.\nMr. Sheppard, 56, is a retired naval officer who markets souvenirs. He also is a former council member and mayor, having resigned the latter office because of personal problems, which he says are behind him. Clearly while in office he was a better manager than Mr. Glascock.\nThe third candidate for mayor is John Leighty, 55, a security guard who spent 12 years on the council. He espouses some good ideas, but Mr. Sheppard's experience in that job makes him the better choice.\nMuch of the mayor-council problem stems from the city's charter, which gives the mayor executive powers but no role in policy making. It is a system made for turmoil, and that leads us to the reasons for favoring the two incumbent council members. Both favor a charter change that would place management in the hands of a professional manager under the control of the council.\nIn Seat 4, Mr. Harmon, 44, a bank vice president, has one council term behind him and service in other capacities, including as a member of a charter review committee. It was in that job that he came to favor the manager form of government. Probably his greatest strength is an open mind when it comes to running the city.\nHe is opposed by Phyllis Sheppard, 56, the estranged wife of Owen Sheppard. She wants to improve the city's recreation program and make sure Casselberry is prudent in spending tax dollars. But she has no specific ways to make those savings and says she will wait until she is elected to come up with her plans. That does not express the leadership the city should expect in its council.\nIn the Seat 5 race, Tom Embree, 49, assistant vice president of a large credit union, has been on the council for eight years and has long favored going to a city manager system. He has a healthy view of dealing with neighboring cities -- cooperate, but keep the city's identity -- and believes the city should assume responsibilities rather than shrugging them off on the state.\nHis opponent is Ed Lewis, 31, a convenience store clerk who has been outspoken against the mayor"}

In fact, it\u2019s part of a recent trend in which gender issues have been elevated by world leaders in international fora and integrated into mainstream policy discussions.\nConsider, for example, Canada\u2019s leadership of the Group of Eight (G8) in June 2010, which gave rise to the Muskoka Initiative on maternal and child health and led to a commitment to invest in national health systems.\nThe foreign ministers of the G8 have also highlighted the role of women in peace and security. In 2012, the ministers called for implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security. A year later, the same group endorsed a declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict.\nGender equality has been a focus of the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit as well. In November 2014, each G20 country set a historic commitment to reduce the gap between the share of men and women in their workforce by 25 percent by 2025.\nThe G20 commitment to increase women\u2019s labor force participation was echoed at the Kruen summit this week in the G7 declaration that emerged. It was also augmented by a new agreement to increase women\u2019s vocational training in the developing world by one-third by 2030. German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted the relationship between gender equality and economic progress in her closing remarks, noting that barriers to women persist everywhere in the world\u2014\u201cnot only in the developing countries where a lot of work still needs to be done,\u201d but also \u201cin industrialized countries.\u201d She promised to convene a conference in September to address the \u201cstructural differences between men and women\u201d that remain.\nResearch from major international economic institutions supports this focus on gender equality by world leaders. Over the past two decades, analyses from the International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank have demonstrated the growth potential of increasing women\u2019s labor force participation. The Bank is in the process of revamping its gender strategy, and mainstreaming the discussion of women\u2019s economic empowerment is a core piece of its new concept note.\nRecent international commitments to advance gender equality are undoubtedly a critical step forward\u2014but the real test of progress for women will lie in their implementation. To ensure gains for women and girls\u2014and for the health of entire communities and economies\u2014such declarations must be coupled with a push to implement the policies they prescribe."}

The Mariners jumped all over Boston\u2019s ace, collecting 11 hits over the 6 1/3 innings he was on the mound.\nPorcello did a good job of limiting the damage to only two earned runs during his outing, but the reigning American League Cy Young winner wasn\u2019t pleased with his performance Sunday.\nRed Sox manager John Farrell echoed his starter\u2019s sentiments and credited Seattle\u2019s success at the plate to taking advantage of mislocated pitches.\nStill, Porcello did more than enough keep his team in the game. But unfortunately for the right-hander, the Red Sox bats were stymied by Mariners starter Christian Bergman, who only allowed four hits over seven scoreless innings.\nSunday\u2019s game marked the sixth time in his last nine starts that the Red Sox failed to score for Porcello, who\u2019s season record fell to 3-6 following the defeat. Boston only notched five hits in the contest and grounded into a season-high four double plays.\nMuch of Porcello\u2019s struggles this season can be pegged as lousy luck, but the Red Sox\u2019s starter plans on keeping it simple in order to get back to his winning ways.\nHere are some other notes from Red Sox vs. Mariners.\n\u2014 Dustin Pedroia went 2-for-4 with a double in Sunday\u2019s game and has reached base in 13 consecutive contests.\n\u2014 Xander Bogaerts logged a single in the first inning with a 3-2 count on him.

{"idx": "1364", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: I belong to a book club of women who are all moms like me. Once a year we pick a classic to read (or reread). This year\u2019s pick was To Kill a Mockingbird, for which Lee won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and on Monday received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I had read Harper Lee\u2019s classic in high school and I remembered the plot, but what I did not remember was how magical Lee\u2019s prose was, how connected I felt to Scout Finch, the narrator, and the rhythms of her life in that small Southern town. I wonder now if I forgot all of this or if I never got the chance to feel this connection when I read Mockingbird in English class.\nI was an avid reader even back then, but I often felt disconnected from the books that we read in school. I was reading James Michener\u2019s historical tomes and Robert Heinlein\u2019s fantasy by the time I was in high school (OK, not classic literature, but so fun to read!). The books we were assigned were so boring! It took forever to read one, stopping after every chapter to \u201cdo something\u201d with the book: memorize vocabulary lists, hunt for examples of figurative language, and write lengthy essays from teacher prompts. These assignments killed any momentum that might have pulled me through a book, and killed my appreciation for the book, too.\nAs Mockingbird continues, Scout\u2019s views show that she has become increasingly disconnected from the learning she must do at school. She says, \u201c\u2026as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what, I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.\u201d To Kill a Mockingbird was written in 1960 (set in the \u201830s), I was in high school in 1984, and as teachers and parents, we are still bemoaning the lack of engagement that students seem to have in school and with reading. Much research into reading has taken place since 1960, so what has not changed for students?\nI think the mistrust is still there. Teachers do not trust students to take control of their own literacy development or their own learning. We still teach books instead of teaching readers. Students are given very little control of what they read, when they read, and how they are allowed to respond. School reading still seems to be about what teachers think students should be getting out of a book. The opportunity to fall in love with a story is denied to students who have come to view school reading as an obstacle course of comprehension assignments. Teachers are the gatekeepers of knowledge instead of the guides. Should knowledge have a gatekeeper? Until we release some of this control back to our students, they will never become independent thinkers or readers. As for students like Scout and me, who walk into classrooms already readers, we will continue to wonder why our love of reading has no place in school.\nOh, yes. I knew better than Scout. I didn't let on that I could read already in first grade. But I have a vivid memory of my first in-school reading group (and how disappointed I was that there was no reading involved), where the teacher held up a picture of ALICE in a red dress and asked us about how we would know it was ALICE if we saw her on another day, in another dress. I knew I wasn't supposed to notice that ALICE was printed in big letters under her feet"}

It's an indispensable role within a growing and pivotal field of research that is laying the groundwork to modernize the Army's greatest asset -- the individual Soldier.\nYet, as newly trained Soldiers, the fundamental combat skills they learned in basic and advanced individual training can rapidly diminish if not performed regularly. To maintain their combat readiness while serving the Army S&T community, NSRDEC's non-commissioned officers responsible for their daily supervision began incorporating a field training regimen into the HRV schedule with the first group of young Soldiers to arrive in FY2018.\n\"It's important for HRV Soldiers to be proficient in the basic Soldier skills they'll be using when they leave Natick and get to their first units\" said Staff Sergeant Anthony Sandoval, the Operations NCO for NSRDEC's Headquarters Research and Development Detachment. \"Part of our job as NCOs is to make sure they're ready.\"\nTo accomplish this, Sandoval's team of NCOs developed and implemented a condensed field and weapons training program around the HRVs busy schedules supporting NSRDEC research studies designed to brush up on their land navigation and marksmanship skills.\n\"These are critical skills for all Soldiers to have, but especially this group of HRVs because they are all 11 Bravo's [Military Occupational Specialty 11-B - Infantry] including two female Infantry Soldiers,\" said Sandoval. \"Every Soldier needs to practice repeatedly for these maneuvers become second nature.\"\nNSRDEC's NCOs made sure the field training didn't conflict with the HRV's obligations as research subjects.\n\"We started with classroom sessions for basic and advanced land navigation before bringing them out to the [Land Navigation] course at Fort Devens,\" said Sergeant Andrew Cochran, HRDD platoon sergeant. \"We are retraining them on the M-4 rifle/carbine and crew-served weapons to maintain their marksmanship skills.\"\n\"We also arranged for them to get some time on the EST [Engagement Skills Trainer] when it's not being used for research purposes,\" said Cochran.\nAs they help Army scientists' research and develop future Soldier performance capabilities, HRV Soldiers are honing their own lethality.

The album will be available internationally on Jan. 30.\nKe$ha is one of the more unlikely stars to contribute to the compilation, released Tuesday. The pop star defined by party anthems like \"Tik Tok\" and \"Your Love Is My Drug\" took on Dylan&apos;s \"Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s Alright.\" As she found herself alone in her bedroom for the first time in months, the words of the song -- about a person bidding goodbye to a lover -- took on a new, deeply personal meaning. She realized she was saying goodbye to her carefree, former life -- before big hits and world tours brought on pressure and priorities. She broke down as she began singing, and the emotion is captured on the record.\n\"Everything has changed. It&apos;s amazing, but there are moments that are incredibly lonely. This caught me at one of those incredibly lonely moments, and it really struck home. There&apos;s a line, `It&apos;s a long and lonesome road, babe, where I&apos;m bound I can&apos;t tell.&apos; It&apos;s tragically relevant,\" said Ke$ha in a phone interview. \"I think these are all positive things for young people to see that you can be strong and you can be irreverent and you can say what you want and you have the freedom of speech, but I&apos;ve learned that vulnerability is actually an asset. It can be just as much of an asset as strength.\"\nKe$ha isn&apos;t the only eye-popping name on the compilation: Nineteen-year-old Miley Cyrus does a rendition of \"You&apos;re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\" The project has a wide range of acts, from Maroon 5 to 92-year-old folk legend Pete Seeger, who sings \"Forever Young\" with a children&apos;s chorus. Dylan waived the publishing rights to his entire catalog, and all of the artists, musicians, engineers and others involved in the recording process did everything pro bono.\nAerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, who recorded \"Man of Peace,\" describes it as \"thin ice\" to cover an artist as iconic as Dylan, because not only are his songs brilliant, but his performances of those songs have become so revered themselves.\n\"(Artists like Dylan) know where (the songs) live and breathe and where the heartbeat is. So covering them can be a touchy thing,\" said Perry, who recorded the Dylan song \"Man of Peace.\" \"Hopefully you don&apos;t make it different just for the sake of making it different.

{"idx": "1377", "prompt": "Continue the following text: On this 70th anniversary of independence, it is appropriate to dwell on the economic and social achievements of the nation since regaining independence in 1948. Despite the economy\u2019s underperformance discussed in last Sunday\u2019s column, there have been significant social and economic achievements since independence.\nThe structure of the economy has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural one to a more diversified one. We have reached middle income status with a substantial increase in per capita income. Attainments in health, life expectancy, literacy and education are impressive.\nThe seven decades have been a period of economic and social transformation. The country\u2019s social and human development has outperformed countries with higher per capita incomes and earned the country a high position in the United Nation\u2019s Human Development Index.\nAlthough the economy grew by only around 4 percent, it has undergone a structural transformation with agriculture\u2019s predominance in the economy being overtaken by industrial and services sectors. Per capita incomes have risen significantly, poverty and unemployment have been reduced and the country\u2019s economic and social infrastructure has improved considerably. The most significant achievements have been in the country\u2019s human development that is far better than most developing countries and even some developed countries. Mortality rates are low, life expectancy has reached 75 years, adult literacy has increased to over 90 percent and education has expanded significantly. Most people enjoy far better social amenities than seven decades ago.\nLargely owing to the improvements in health and education, the country has gone through the three phases of the demographic transition in the first half century after independence and entered the fourth stage of an ageing population. The country\u2019s population growth of 2.8 percent per year in the 1950s has been reduced to less than 1 percent (0.9). Yet the annual population growth is about 200,000, as in the 1950\u2019s.\nOne of the most significant achievements since independence was the attainment of self-sufficiency in rice. At independence, the country with a population of only 7 million imported about half her requirements of rice and much of her other essential foods. Today with a population of 21 million Sri Lanka is about self-sufficient.\nThe seventy years since independence have witnessed profound and irreversible economic changes. The economy has moved from a pre-dominantly agricultural one to one in which both industry and services contribute more to GDP. The growth of industry for export has been a striking development of the last two decades. Not only has the relative importance of agriculture declined, but its composition too has changed.\nThe economic reforms since late 1977 had a significant impact on the structure of the economy and changed the basic character of the Sri Lankan economy. The share of manufacturing in GDP has increased. Currently the contribution of agriculture to GDP is only 7 percent. The industrial sector (including construction) contributes about 40 percent to GDP. There has been an increase in the contribution of the services sector to 55 per cent today.\nThese structural changes in the economy are reflected in the country\u2019s trade pattern. Agricultural exports that dominated the export structure from the beginning of the plantation economy till the 1980s declined to 27 per cent in 2016. Industrial exports amounted to 77 percent of total export earnings.\nThese proportions of exports are to some extent misleading. Agricultural exports are more significant than suggested by the 27 percent as value added in agricultural exports is much higher than in industrial exports.\nNotwithstanding these compositional changes in exports and imports, Sri Lanka\u2019s trade dependence (imports and exports"}

Gatlin was addressing members of he media ahead of today's IAAF Diamond League meet at the Stade Louis II.\nThe American, who faces a solid field, which includes countrymen Tyson Gay and Trayvon Bromell along with Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade and Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut, is also banking on Bolt rounding into top shape by the time the 100m and 200m finals come around at next month's World Championships in Beijing, noting that he thinks that will be the ideal time to face the six-time Olympic champion and reigning world double sprint champion.\nGatlin's last loss in either the 100m or 200m came in 2013, while there has been much doubt about Bolt's readiness after injury forced him out of the Paris and Lausanne Diamond League meets earlier this month.\n\"I always believe that, if one man can do it (run a record time), then another can do it, it opens up the door and that's how humans have been for years and decades,\" said Gatlin. \"At the end of the day, I do think 9.58 is obtainable; it just takes the right time, the right day and the right opponents to push you through to such a magnificent record.\"\n\"Is he (Bolt) avoiding me? I don't think so. I think he is a great showman, he's the kind of guy that will wait until when its right, and hopefully Beijing and the 100m finals or the 200m will be the right time for us to put on a spectacular show.\n\"I think it's a great lead-up to a really good story and a really good race, so it's a highly anticipated bout that is to come. In the past, in 2012, he got beaten at his nationals in the 100m and 200m, but he went out there and prevailed in the 100m and 200m, so the guy knows how to step up,\" Gatlin added of Bolt. \"I believe that he will be fit. He is the kind of guy who knows how to show up on the day.\"\nGatlin, who also brushed aside the IAAF's recent rule change that bars athletes - like himself, who have been charged with doping offences, from winning its end-of-year Athlete of the Year award, says he has been itching to break the 9.69 American record held by Gay.\n\"I don't run for awards, I run for medals so that doesn't matter to me,\" Gatlin insisted.\nBesides Ashmeade, who himself will be looking to bounce back from a horrible 20.96 last-place finish in the 200m in Lausanne recently, Jamaica's interest will come in the women's 400m where national champion Christine Day and Commonwealth champion Stephenie-Ann McPherson will face American Francena McCorory and Brit Christine Ohuruogu.\nUS-born Jamaican athlete Aisha Praught will also feature in the women's 3000m steeplechase, where she is expected to be pacing for two kilometres, in what she considers important speed work ahead of her World Championships competition."}

His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol.\nAn initial confession of \u201ca few drinks\u201d turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact. After interviewing and examining him, I recapped why he had been hospitalized and explained that hospitalized for a few more days while we monitored his liver function.\nHere was a patient with a damaged liver and little mystery about what had caused it, and yet here he was, with questions about\u2026 mold?\nThis was not the first\u2014and certainly won\u2019t be the last\u2014patient to ask about mold. My patients have often wondered aloud whether mold is causing their breathing troubles, sinus congestion, overwhelming fatigue, and so on. Ultimately, I told this patient the same thing I told all the others: Mold exposure was not responsible for your health problems.\nMold worries are generally unfounded. There is no evidence that otherwise healthy individuals have any reason to fear falling ill from building mold, mold inhalation, or any other type of exposure to so-called toxic mold (PDF). Even when it comes to water-damaged buildings, any medically proven associations with health issues have come with long-term occupational exposures\u2014not household exposures.\nIf you need more assurance, look no further than a study that examined residents of post-Katrina New Orleans: It didn\u2019t find any increased risk of adverse respiratory effects from water-damaged buildings. This helps explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn\u2019t recommend routine mold testing in households, instead suggesting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) guide to mold control to ensure indoor air quality in high moisture environments.\nThat said, mold can cause health problems in certain populations\u2014but typically, it only seriously affects patients who have underlying health conditions. Specifically, immunocompromised patients could be at risk of systemic fungal infections, and patients prone to allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma could have responses to inhaled mold.\nThere are skin and blood-testing methods available to determine whether patients truly have mold allergies or not. Additionally, anybody who has had long-term occupational exposure to mold could develop a rare disease known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which affects lung function. But beyond these medically established connections to mold exposure and medical illnesses, much of the rest is internet lore.\nSo, unless you\u2019re in one of those rare categories, you don\u2019t have anything to fear about exposure\u2014and yet mold hysteria is fairly widespread. Why?\nThe answer is a depressing case study in internet-era medical misinformation, rumor-mongering, and irresponsible online doctoring. In short, some irresponsible people are drumming up fears about mold and then profiting off of those fears. These profits come at the expense of patients like mine who use these theories as scapegoats, failing to understand and tackle the real medical issues at hand.\nOn the surface, there certainly appears to be a wealth of online information about the supposedly harmful effects of mold exposure.

Denny Rehberg has made a point of criticizing Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's campaign money ties to lobbyists in their battle for the U.S. Senate, but the Republican has been less vocal about his son's position as an executive with a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm.\nRehberg's son A.J. Rehberg, who has worked at GAGE since 2008, more recently became the point man for the Mongolian government's interests on Capitol Hill. But Rehberg says there is no conflict of interest and he has done due diligence in asking the House ethics committee for guidance in the situation.\nThe congressman was told lawmakers' family members are not prohibited from working at a lobbying firm. GAGE also employs former Republican U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns.\n\"There is no law, rule, or standard of conduct that absolutely prohibits a family member from accepting employment with a lobbying firm, or even engaging in lobbying-related activities,\" ethics committee leaders told Rehberg in a letter.\nRehberg was advised to establish an office policy prohibiting lobbying of his office by his son as a safeguard, even though A.J. is not a registered lobbyist, and to warn GAGE not to advertise the relationship in attracting clients. He was also told to make sure GAGE was not given extra influence as a result of hiring his son as a vice president.\n\"But Denny and A.J. have taken it a step further, establishing a professional firewall. There's an understanding between them that they just don't talk shop together,\" said spokesman Jed Link. \"Denny also made it perfectly clear to GAGE that hiring A.J. would neither help nor hurt their standing with him or his office. A.J. being on staff has no impact whatsoever.\"\nAlthough A.J. Rehberg is not a registered lobbyist for his work with GAGE, the Embassy of Mongolia considers the congressman's son \"the primary point of contact for the firm's work with the embassy.\"\nThe embassy said in a news release earlier this year that it has hired GAGE to be its first-ever lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. GAGE says on its website that it represents Mongolia to both Congress and the administration.\nBut regulatory paperwork shows that GAGE principal Leo Giacometto does the official lobbying work for the Mongolians. GAGE did not return a call Tuesday seeking comment.\nThe Mongolian embassy counts Rep.

Rehberg has attacked Tester for taking more campaign donations from lobbyists than anyone else in Congress, and the Republican campaign has suggested the donations could lead to improper influence.\nThe issue has attracted the attention of CREW, or Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The watchdog group recently asked the State Department, in a public records request, if Rehberg has ever written the agency on behalf of GAGE or its Mongolian interests.\n\"We are routinely concerned with the issue of members of Congress using their position as profit centers for their families.

{"idx": "1384", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Palatine has become the first municipality along the Northwest Tollway corridor to ask the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority to relocate a main toll plaza originally proposed east of Roselle Road.\nTrustees took a stand Monday by agreeing to ask the state authority to move the site of the proposed toll plaza further west, between Roselle and Barrington Roads.\nAlthough the village`s opinion is strictly advisory, the tollway authority is seeking input from Palatine, as well as Schaumburg and Hoffman Estates, where highway officials will present their proposal next month.\nThe authority initially proposed a new plaza between Meacham and Roselle Roads to stop eastbound and westbound traffic on all six lanes of the highway for a 40-cent toll.\nSuch a ''main line'' toll plaza would enable the tollway authority to cure a major headache of the system by removing the 15-cent toll booths at entrance and exit ramps on the Illinois Highway 53 and Northwest Tollway interchange.\nBut Palatine fears that a plaza between Meacham and Roselle Roads will send more traffic through the village, as motorists exit early to avoid paying the toll.\n''The village believes that traffic from the Palatine area can and will use convenient alternate streets through Palatine to avoid any toll plaza east of Roselle Road,'' Mayor Rita Mullins wrote in the village`s formal response to the proposal.\nThe new toll collected at the main line plaza will help offset the cost of installing additional ramps at Beverly Road and Illinois Highway 59. The ramps will provide access to the Merchandise Group headquarters of Sears, Roebuck and Co. when it opens next year in Hoffman Estates.\nSears is paying the bulk of the cost for the Beverly Road project and a portion of the Highway 59 cost.\nRamps are also proposed for Meacham Road, which currently has no approach to the tollway.\nMullins said a toll plaza west of Roselle would more fairly place the burden of tolls on new traffic heading to Hoffman Estates.\nBut Hoffman Estates officials did not endorse Palatine`s solution and said they were not convinced that new traffic would necessarily spill into local streets.\n''If Palatine is concerned about this, they need to be able to show and demonstrate through a traffic study that cars are going to do what they say they are going to do,'' Hoffman Estates Village Manager Peter Burchard said. Palatine has not ordered a traffic study.\nNoting that toll booths are proposed for on and off ramps at Illinois Highway 59, Mayor Michael O`Malley said that ''should alleviate part of Palatine`s fear.'' But he declined further comment on Palatine`s proposal until representatives of the tollway authority have appeared before the Hoffman Estates Village Board."}

Doctoral institutions saw the biggest gains, showing 60 percent more bandwidth. Bandwidth at bachelor\u2019s institutions was up 51 percent, and master\u2019s institutions increased by 32 percent. Two-year colleges had the smallest gains, with a 28-percent increase in bandwidth since 2006.\nDespite across-the-board gains in internet bandwidth, doctoral institutions had an edge on access to the highest performing networks. Twenty-six percent of those universities said they had access to networks running at 1,000 megabits per second or faster. Ten percent of master\u2019s institutions had access to these networks\u2013whereas less than 3 percent of two-year colleges and bachelor\u2019s programs had access to networks that fast.\nThere are still colleges using relatively slow-bandwidth internet connections, defined as speeds less than 4.5 megabits per second, the report said. Six percent of two-year schools have these slower connection speeds, along with 3 percent of bachelor\u2019s schools, according to the study. The most common bandwidth for universities with master\u2019s programs was between 45 and 89 Mbps.\nThe EDUCAUSE study, conducted and written by researchers Julia A. Rudy and Brian L. Hawkins, said doctoral programs\u2019 access to high-speed networks was \"most likely [owing] to the large data sets, visualization, and other applications needed by faculty at such institutions for their academic work.\"\nOther data saw little change from 2006 to 2007. Shaping bandwidth\u2013the common practice of adjusting and limiting internet usage to prevent network interference\u2013remains a staple of higher education. Only 6 percent of all campuses surveyed in the report said they did not have bandwidth-shaping policies. Nearly 14 percent of two-year institutions did not shape or track bandwidth\u2013by far the highest percentage cited in the Core Data Service Report.\nHawkins and Rudy said IT funding in higher education followed expected patterns once again in 2007. Funding increased according to \"institutional complexity,\" meaning two-year colleges had the least funding, while schools with doctoral programs had the most.\nUniversities with doctoral programs reported $11.1 million in annual IT funding, while master\u2019s universities reported $2.7 million, bachelor\u2019s programs had $1.4 million, and two-year institutions received $1.1 million.\nExperts said a massive funding advantage for universities with doctoral programs wasn\u2019t a surprise, with some experts adding that the most prestigious colleges are often inefficient with their IT budgets, spending money simply because they have the resources available.\n\"It might not be necessary,\" said Lee Prevost, president and founder of SchoolDude.com, a technology solutions company that serves more than 3,500 school districts and higher-education campuses. \"The large universities do it because it"}

Finally, in late 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that the president has the right to refuse to appoint parliament\u2019s choice of general prosecutor, but that he must cite good reasons for doing so. At the very end of 2012, Ga\u0161parovi\u010d sent a letter to the speaker of parliament in which he formally rejected \u010cent\u00e9\u0161. \u010cent\u00e9\u0161 promptly appealed his decision to the Constitutional Court, claiming that his rights had been infringed, but the case became bogged down after he and Ga\u0161parovi\u010d between them challenged 12 of the court\u2019s 13 judges on grounds of alleged bias.\nThis Constitutional Court decision comes shortly after parliament elected a new candidate for general prosecutor, Jarom\u00edr \u010ci\u017en\u00e1r.

Apple refers to these types of applications as \"universal.\"\n\"How much work will it be?\" he said. \"It depends on the type of project.\"\nCarbon applications contain old Mac OS 9 code carried over from the port to Mac OS X.\nCocoa applications, those written completely with Mac OS X technology, would be easier to port.\nMost of Apples own software products are Cocoa applications, but many major third-party apps are Carbon.\nThe issue for creating universal Mac software is the order of bytes stored in memory and written to a file. Developers refer to this as the Endian problem, in which PowerPC and Intel processors store bytes in opposite order.\nApple said that developers can make Carbon applications universal, but custom resources will make solving the Endian problem more difficult than Cocoa applications.\n/zimages/1/28571.gifRead more here about Adobe expressing support for Apples switch to Intel chips.\nSerlet indicated that developers might have to rewrite Carbon code by hand rather using the automated tools in Apples Xcode tools.\nSerlet told developers that Apple will continue to add new Carbon tools to aid the porting process. He also suggested that the byte order problem could be eased through the use XML or HIArchive, a technique now available in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.\nCocoa applications will only require \"minor tweaks\" and a recompile to solve byte order issue and become universal, according to Apple. The use of the Objective C programming language in Cocoa software also helps.\nMac OS X Unix projects, including software for the X11 windowing environment, will be easier to make universal than Cocoa apps, according to Apple.

One piece I came across suggested that Chicago housewives buy electric clothes-dryers because the particulate pollution would soil any clothes left outside to dry.\nIn the study, women who were exposed to higher levels of ambient particulate matter (PM) over the long term experienced more decline in their cognitive functioning over a four-year period. Higher levels of long-term exposure to both coarse PM (PM2.5-10) and fine PM (PM2.5) were associated with significantly faster cognitive decline.\nThere are few recent studies that analyze air pollution and cognitive function in older adults, but this is the first study to examine change in cognitive function over a period of time and whether exposure to the size of particulate matter is important.\nShort-term exposure (for up to 7 days) to all major air pollutants, with the exception of ozone, is significantly associated with an increased risk of heart attack, according to a review and meta-analysis of previous studies appearing in the February 15 issue of JAMA.\nWhen pollution in Chicago was so bad that it blocked the sun, one concern doctors had for the youth was that children would be harmed by lack of exposure to its rays.

The company claims the Cooperative Intersection Safety System (CISS), part of the EU-funded Intersafe 2 project, could improve traffic safety at road junctions by as much as 80 per cent.\nThe system uses laser scanners and ultrasound sensors positioned at the front and on the passenger side of the truck to monitor a driver's blind spot -- the area he or she cannot see while turning. This information is processed using on-board computers, which output a bird's-eye view of the lorry and its immediate surroundings on a TV monitor inside the cabin.\nThe CISS system can also reduce the chances of drivers failing to notice pedestrians at a crossing. A radio receiver fitted on the roof of the truck communicates wirelessly with nearby traffic lights to monitor whether the lights are red or green, or whether someone has pressed the pedestrian crossing button.\nIf the system determines a cyclist or pedestrian is at risk, warning lights or sound are activated to warn the driver of a possible collision.\nVolvo says Intersafe 2 is merely a research and development project at this stage, and that there are currently no plans to introduce CISS in the real world, but we don't believe a word of it. The company has a wealth of high-tech safety technologies, many of which started life as R&D projects but are now available to buy.\nWe'll be keeping our eyes peeled and our fingers crossed that this gets a commercial rollout sometime in the near future."}
{"idx": "1411", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks at a podium backed by fellow Senate Republicans.\nThose who claim that the Senate Republican proposal to replace Obamacare will kick millions of people out from health insurance coverage are dead wrong. Yes, it will cause the number of insured people to decline, but that will happen because millions of healthy individuals will be incentivized to voluntarily opt-out of traditional health insurance. For those people, the law will make traditional insurance a sucker bet. Instead of buying comprehensive health insurance policies, as they are currently known, they will either go without insurance for as long as possible or purchase a new type of low-cost insurance that the new proposals will likely create if they become law.\nLet's be clear. No one really wants to buy health insurance. When you do, you are effectively making a bet with your insurance company that you will get sick while they are betting you don't. If you do get sick, you get a potential payoff. If you don't, the insurance company keeps your premium. The same is true with all insurance. No one wants to buy auto or fire insurance, but we do in case we get into a car accident or our house burns down. But if the laws were changed so that fire insurance claims could be made after the fact, then consumer behavior would change significantly. People would simply opt-out, and then put in claims when and if they have a fire. But the only reason insurance companies can afford to rebuild houses is because so many of their customers pay premiums but never file claims. So if fire insurance companies could not discriminate against people with pre-existing fire conditions, they would cease to exist as businesses.\nThe architects of Obamacare saw this problem in advance and attempted to solve it by imposing financial penalties on those who made the rational decision not to buy. The Law's fatal flaw was that the penalties were not stiff enough to stop people from opting-out. (If they were that high the law would have likely been declared unconstitutional). When the healthy individuals left the system, many insurance companies experienced huge losses, forcing them to either exit markets completely or to raise premiums steeply on those who remained.\nAmazingly, despite the many clear warning signs that too many people were dropping out, the original version of the Senate bill did even less than Obamacare to encourage healthy people to stay. That version allowed such individuals to forgo insurance when they didn't need it, but guaranteed that they could buy, without penalty, when they did. This would have exacerbated the huge losses that insurance companies are already seeing under Obamacare and would have forced the government to step in and transfer those losses to taxpayers. But, on Monday, the Senate belatedly recognized what they should have realized from the start, and came up with what purports to be a solution to prevent people from gaming the system. But like the veiled attempt made by the House, the Senate version falls well short of the mark.\nThe House attempts to keep healthy people in the system by imposing a 30% surcharge on insurance for one year after a person with lapsed coverage (of 63 days or more) came back into the system. In fact, it was this provision that prompted Present Trump to call the plan \"mean.\" But the 30% one year bump is a small price to pay for those who may go years, or even decades, paying nothing at all.\nOnce the Senate realized that they needed some kind of penalty, they devised something that is even \"meaner\" by Trump's standards. They now propose a 6-month waiting period on people with a 63 day lapse in coverage. This means those hoping to get a free"}

{"idx": "1421", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: A piece from Paul Krugman in The New York Times this week criticizes bitcoin for being antisocial and for not having a State-controlled supply while secretly admiring its powerful abstractness.\nAs a complicit minion in the State's appropriation of the monetary unit, Krugman perpetuates 'The State Theory of Money' myth that the sovereign's power to collect taxes and declare legal tender imbues a currency with ultimate value.\nWhile that may be a reason to acquire a certain amount of government fiat currency, it is a transitory value because in the end it is still based on a State-sanctioned illusion. Anyone who has visited a weekend flea market has noticed the old coin and currency collector displays filled with past experiments in national fiat money. Those paper notes were at one time valued for something too.\nWe don't want a pristine monetary standard untouched by human frailty as Krugman claims. We want freedom in the monetary standard untouched by the politicizing process.\nIn a Krugman world, centralized management of the money supply is preferable to a market-based outcome because the academically-informed economists will serve the best interests of the economy at large. However, our monetary overlords possess no special knowledge or secret sauce that justifies dictatorial control over money any more than it would justify dictatorial control over the market for something like soda beverages or dog food. Trust in mathematics trumps trust in central bankers.\nThe question of political control over a monetary system is the greatest litmus test for discovering those that seek control over others. Usually, it will be cloaked in terms like full employment, price stability, temporary stimulus, quantitative easing, and economic growth, but manipulation of the money supply serves only to favor the issuers of that particular monetary unit.\nMoney has a lot in common with religion. At some level, it requires a huge leap of faith. Yes, a belief in gold requires this too as the non-monetary value assigned to gold is probably no more than 5% of its market price. However, this is also what makes bitcoin the ultimate social money because for its value it merely requires others, not the law. Money is already the most viral thing on the planet and the network effect exponentially reinforces that.\nKrugman actually struggles to assert that bitcoin is antisocial because he cites economist Paul Samuelson who once declared that money is a \"social contrivance,\" not something that stands outside society. Samuelson is absolutely correct on that point and bitcoin stands firmly within society. It is no one's right to question why some place value on bitcoin and some do not since all value is subjective. The rationale for assigning value to bitcoin is as varied as the human fabric itself.\nIn this context, society can be defined as those mutual users willing to agree to a medium of exchange and a store of value. Since bitcoin, just as the Internet, recognizes no political boundaries, Krugman resists seeing the global monetary unit as something social. Krugman sees society only as a multitude of aggregated fiefdoms where he is the emperor's cherished tailor.\nThough, just like the untainted child in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, some of us are beginning to notice. It's not the illusion itself that so offends our sensibilities, but more the notion that a competitive illusion is not to be permitted.

Doom-and-gloom research like this always requires a hefty grain of salt, but after speaking with numerous industry experts an entire shaker might be necessary.\nImperva looked at a variety of security solutions from such vendors as Kaspersky, Avast, AVG, Microsoft, and McAfee, to name a few. They pitted these sentinels against 82 randomly collected malware samples, examining how successful the security software was in detecting the rogue software.\nFrom their work, Imperva asserts that anti-malware software is not fast or responsive enough to combat modern threats. Security software, writes Imperva, is \"much better at detecting malware that spreads rapidly in massive quantities of identical samples, while variants that are of limited distribution (such as government sponsored attacks) usually leave a large window of opportunity.\"\nThey also found no correlation between the money users spend on virus protection and the security provided by software, and suggest that both individual and enterprise customers look at freeware alternatives.\nThe study has garnered a lot of attention, but when speaking with security professionals, and some of the companies named in the study, Security Watch found many who believe the study to be deeply flawed.\nJust about every lab or security company felt that Imperva's sample size of malware was too small to support the conclusions made by the study. AV-Test's Andreas Marx told us that his firm receives about a million samples of new, unique malware per week. Similarly, Peter Stelzhammer from AV-Comparatives told us that they receive 142,000 new malicious files each day.\nFor their part, Imperva wrote in the study that they intentionally used a small sampling, but insist that it is demonstrative of existing threats. \"Our selection of malware was not biased but was randomly taken from the Web reflecting a potential method for constructing an attack,\" writes Imperva.\nNSS Labs research director Randy Abrams, however, had a sharply different interpretation of Imperva's methodology. \"Searching for filenames is guaranteed to miss sophisticated attacks and most other malware too,\" Abrams told Security Watch, commenting on the means Imperva used to locate malware for the study. \"Focusing on Russian forums significantly biases the sample collection. It is obvious that no thought went into obtaining a real-world, representative samples set.\"\nTo carry out their study, Imperva used the online tool VirusTotal to perform their tests which was cited as a critical weakness of the test. \"The problem with this test is that it ripped threats, in the form of executable files, and then scanned those using VirusTotal,\" said Simon Edwards of Dennis Labs. \"VT is not a suitable system to use when evaluating anti-malware products largely because the scanners used in VT are not supported by additional technology such as web reputation systems.\"\nKaspersky Labs, whose product was used in the study, also questioned the testing methodology employed by Imperva in the experiment. \"When scanning for potentially dangerous files, the VirusTotal service used by Imperva's specialists does not use the full versions of antivirus products, but merely relies on a standalone scanner,\" wrote Kaspersky Labs in a statement issued to Security Watch.\n\"This approach means that the majority of protection technologies available in modern antivirus software are simply ignored.

The new trailer focuses on their budding relationship, rather that diving deeper into just how their newfound love begins to 'cure' the undead masses (like in the first trailer).\nNext year will be a big year for Hoult, as he's being upgraded to leading man in two movies: Warm Bodies and Jack the Giant Slayer, which is the first collaboration between the actor and director Bryan Singer (before they re-team for X-Men: Days of Future Past, that is). Hoult seems to be more in his element playing the emotional R in Bodies, rather than the unexpected hero Jack in Slayer - based on trailer footage, that is.

Warm Bodies does indeed stand to benefit from Levine's smart storytelling touch; though, we will have to wait and see how well Levine handles the larger-budget demands of Bodies, seeing how his previous films were smaller and simpler by comparison.\nThen again, Levine is a director who does well working with actors and the Bodies cast as a whole is solid - including, Hoult and Palmer (who is usually a standout, even in stuff like I Am Number Four) appearing with John Malkovich, Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Analeigh Tipton (Crazy, Stupid, Love.).

Because we live in a celebrity-driven culture, the wedding of Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky offers a rare opportunity to influence more interfaith couples to make Jewish choices. Yet instead our Jewish leaders\u2019 responses seem almost calculated to push those couples away.\nAfter much speculation about which Jewish traditions, if any, might be included in the Clinton-Mezvinsky wedding, it was striking to see the first pictures emerge \u2014 the groom in a visible yarmulke with the Clintons, then the groom wearing a tallis, standing next to his lovely bride next to a visible ketubah \u2014 to say nothing of reports of a chuppah, the Seven Blessings and glass-breaking.\nChelsea, Marc and the Clintons are very smart people. The only message they could have been sending is that Jewish traditions are very important to Marc, and that Chelsea and her parents are, at the very least, happy to allow Jewish traditions to play a prominent role in this most important moment in the couple\u2019s lives.\nYes, the wedding started shortly before the end of Shabbat, a not unheard of practice even when both the bride and groom are Jewish. How many of us abstain from all work until after sundown on Saturdays? Should a couple\u2019s choice be rejected as \u201cnot Jewish\u201d because they want to maximize the time they spend celebrating with family and friends?\nAnd yes, a rabbi co-officiated the ceremony with a Methodist minister. There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d answer to who should perform weddings for interfaith couples. Chelsea and Marc were fortunate that a rabbi of the stature of James Ponet, who has had an outstanding career building the thriving Yale Hillel, was willing to co-officiate at their wedding.\nThe heads of both the Reform and Reconstructionist rabbinical associations noted their movements\u2019 official disapproval of co-officiation, with Rabbi Richard Hirsh, executive director of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association, telling The Jewish Week that \u201chaving a co-officiated ceremony points in the direction of a home that won\u2019t be primarily Jewish.\u201d But an interfaith couple may in fact have decided to raise their children as Jews, and still want the non-Jewish partner\u2019s religious background represented at their wedding. Or the couple may not have decided \u2014 yet \u2014 to have a Jewish home, but be very open to the possibility. Criticism of their wedding choices is a sure way to influence them to not go in the Jewish direction.\nWith half of Jews intermarrying, the size and vitality of the liberal Jewish community depends on how many interfaith couples raise their children as Jews: If half or more do, we grow; less than half means decline. An interfaith couple\u2019s wedding is a great opportunity to show that Judaism has something that has meaning and value for them. Giving them a positive Jewish experience can only influence them toward more engagement in Jewish life.\nFor now, I can only hope that Chelsea and Marc and the thousands of other couples like them will not be deterred by what our Jewish leaders are saying. There are other voices in the liberal Jewish community, and they need to be raised, with a clear and unequivocal message: We are so glad your Jewish wedding was such a positive experience for you.

That was the first time in a decade that the total refugee intake from around the world included more Muslims than Christians.\nApart from Christians and Muslims, the denominational breakdown for FY 2018 includes Buddhists (5.2 percent), Hindus (3.1 percent) and Jews (0.5 percent), mostly from Bhutan, Bhutan again, and Russia respectively.\nThe Christian refugees include large contingents of Catholics, Protestants and Pentecostalists from the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 which alone accounts for almost 39 percent of the total number of refugees resettled in the U.S.\nThere are also sizeable numbers of Baptists from Ukraine, Orthodox Christians from Eritrea, and Christians (no denomination specified) from Burma.\nMuslim refugees comprise 2,016 individuals identified simply as Muslim, with Burma (857) and the DRC (324) accounting for the largest groups; 655 Shi\u2019ites, including 504 from Afghanistan; and 486 Sunnis, with Afghans again making up the largest number (226).\nThe U.S. has also admitted 173 Ahmadiyya \u2013 all from Pakistan, a country whose constitution does not recognize Ahmadis as Muslims, and whose penal code criminalizes Ahmadi worship.\nIn recent years the makeup of Syrian refugees in particular became a sensitive issue, both because of overall security concerns but also because so few of those admitted were Christians.\nThat was the case despite the Obama administration\u2019s determination in 2016 that ISIS\u2019 atrocities against Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in areas under its control amounted to genocide.\nThe disparity was especially stark in FY 2016, when of a total of 12,587 Syrian refugees admitted \u2013 accounting for 1.8 percent of all refugees admitted that year \u2013 12,486 (99.2 percent) were Muslims and 68 (0.5 percent) were Christians, including Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Catholic.\nAlthough Muslims do significantly outnumber Christians in Syria, the Christian minority nonetheless made up around 10 percent of the total population when the civil war began in 2011.\nIn FY 2017, the U.S"}

Marillyn Hewson, the appointed successor to long time CEO Bob Stevens, said she's also confident the framework for a deal for lot six will be completed by the end of December.\n\"We are progressing well with favorable dialogue and I do feel confident that we are going to get some closure on lot five this year,\" Hewson said. \"We want to line that up and I think our customer wants to line that up with quickly getting at least some contract on lot 6 even if it\u2019s undefinitized.\"\nHewson's comments come a day after Defense Under Secretary Frank Kendall told Reuters at the Credit Suisse 2012 Aerospace & Defense Conference that he had a \"very positive meeting\" with Hewson and he thinks the two sides are \"getting close\" to a deal.\nThe $500 billion in cuts to the defense budget stipulated by sequestration played a major role in motivating Pentagon and Lockheed Martin leaders to reach a deal for lots five and six before the end of 2012. Congress has until Jan. 2 to reach a deficit reduction deal or the sequestration cuts found in the Budget Control Act will be enacted. Those cuts include an across-the-board 10 percent cut to planned defense spending over the next decade.\nHowever, the sequester cuts can't touch previously obligated funds. If Lockheed and the Pentagon can agree to contracts for lots five and six, they could insulate funding for the 64 new Joint Strike Fighters in those production lots.\n\"I think it\u2019s in all of our interests, the company\u2019s as well as the government\u2019s, to get that next tranche of funding for lot six in place before the end of the calendar year. And as I said here today I\u2019m pretty confident that\u2019s going to occur,\" said Bruce Tanner, Lockheed Martin's chief financial officer, who spoke with Hewson and Stevens at the Credit Suisse conference.\nLockheed Martin selected Hewson to lead the world's largest defense company after Stevens' previous successor, Christopher Kubasik, resigned. She is scheduled to take over as CEO in January. She has already started to take part in the F-35 production lot negotiations.\nDefense consultant Loren Thompson said the sequestration deadline has played the largest role in moving toward an agreement on the production lots, but Hewson's involvement can't be underestimated.\n\"They were working against the dealine and it created the forcing function to get an agreement,\" Thompson said. \"However, Marrilyn can help break up log jams. Hewson is very good at dealing with customers and sub contractors. It has probably made a difference.\"\nProtecting the production lots is vital to keeping costs down for the Joint Strike Fighter program, Thompson said. As production progresses, the costs per plane drop. Pentagon officials hope that by the tenth lot, the Air Force version of the F-35 price tag per aircraft could drop to the level of a current F-16, Thompson said.\nHowever, the sequestration cuts could put that progress in jeopardy unless the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin can insulate the funding"}

{"idx": "1441", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A new study by researchers at Yale and Johns Hopkins University has discovered how asthmatic bronchial spasms \u2014 muscle contractions in the airway that cause difficulty breathing in asthma patients\u2014 occur by creating a microdevice that mimics the behavior of the human respiratory airways.\nLed by Andre Levchenko, professor of biomedical engineering, and Johns Hopkins postdoctoral fellow Onur Kilic, the team investigated the mechanism by which the smooth muscle surrounding bronchial airways \u2014 the network of tubes that deliver oxygen to the lungs \u2014 suddenly contract and cause bronchial spasms. During bronchial spasms, sudden contractions of the smooth muscles result in decreased airflow, not only in asthma patients but also in healthy people.\nUsing a microdevice that mimics the behavior of bronchial airways, researchers were able to create what Levchenko called a \u201cbronchi on a chip\u201d \u2014 a microphysiological model of the airway to analyze biochemical and mechanical signals.\nAccording to the study, muscle contractions triggered by allergens or other small substances in the airways initially respond to positive feedback, meaning that initial contractions lead to more contractions. But eventually, the contractions stop when smooth muscle relaxes. The study found that in the asthmatic model \u2014 the microdevice with cells taken from an asthma patient \u2014 this relaxation takes much longer than in the nonasthmatic model, explaining why asthmatic patients experience airway constriction for a longer period of time.\nThe study also discovered that inducing a second asthmatic trigger during a spasm at the right time to actually induce smooth muscle relaxation and stop the spasm \u2014 a finding with important clinical implications, according to Levchenko.\n\u201cOne of the most surprising discoveries in our model was that various triggers of smooth muscle contractions could not only stimulate the model airway once, but also that when the same trigger was used again, and if the second trigger came at the right time, the persistent bronchial spasm could actually relax,\u201d Levchenko said.\nAccording to Kilic, building the device required several components. First, the device had to keep human lung cells alive using a toxin-free silicon elastoma medium through which cells can breathe. Second, the device required epithelial cells, or cells that protect and support the structure of the airway and serve crucial functions in oxygen exchange. Finally, the device required smooth muscle cells \u2014 strips of muscle that surround the airway \u2014 in order to simulate the human bronchial airways\u2019 contractions.\nThe smooth muscles lack biological function, much like the human appendix, and are referred to as \u201cvestigial\u201d leftovers of the evolutionary past, according to Kilic. However, complications in the smooth muscle could still lead to serious medical problems, notably the airway constrictions experienced by asthma patients.\nA mechanical stimulus similar to a bronchial spasm was artificially induced in the microdevice to resemble deep breathing. As these motions opened up the airways, cells incorporated in the device were able to stretch. When pressure was applied to the cells exposed to air, airway constriction involving epithelial cell compression led to strong contractions of the smooth muscle cells.\nLevchenko and Kilic explained that the research team recorded the movement of magnetic beads attached to the cells\u2019 surface in order to monitor mechanical changes within the cells during muscle contraction and relaxation. By incorporating the cells of both asthmatic patients and healthy people into the device, the researchers were able to contrast the activity of asthmatic and normal muscle movements.\nThe researchers also"}

The only reason why Avery is starting is because he's our best defensive player. We were really worried about (Darius) Dangerfield and he held him to six points (seven below his average).\"\nOffensively, Alvernia didn't shoot much better than Lycoming, but it got 21 points from Justin Thomas, a 6-3 freshman from Newark, Del.

{"idx": "1446", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Theresa May\u2019s unedifying rush to embrace Donald Trump exposes several paradoxes about economic policy, the most prominent being their respective views on free trade: the British prime minister is in favour but the US president is implacably opposed.\nJust how this one plays out will be of critical strategic interest to Ireland, arguably one of the most globalised countries in the world.\nTrump\u2019s mumbled threat to impose a 20 per cent tariff on Mexican imports is one piece of a larger jigsaw that includes pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and a determination to pick a trade fight with China.\nTheresa May seems convinced (but I doubt if this is sincere) that a series of multilateral free trade agreements between the UK and the rest of the world will more than make up for exiting both the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\nFree trade is one of those peculiar things that provokes an almost religious fervour amongst its defenders and opponents. One of the problems facing Trump is the deeply held belief of most Republican senators and congressmen that the virtues of free trade are up there with the right to own a semi-automatic assault rifle.\nPaul Krugman won his Nobel Prize for work on international trade. I guess he is the epitome of the experts that we now deride. But even a superficial acquaintance with his work \u2013 and that of more modern researchers in the field \u2013 leads to clear conclusions. Trade policy is complicated, trade theory equally so and the available data does not lead to easy, universally applicable lessons about what does and does not work. Beware politicians who claim otherwise.\nEconomists generally share the Republican and Theresa May view of the world. But their opinions are often less fervent and more nuanced: there are downsides to free trade but academics don\u2019t like to talk about them because of the way these caveats get hijacked by Trump-style anti-trade populists.\nOne area of controversy is over so-called distributional effects: free trade does create winners, but there are also losers. The overall economic consequences are usually thought to be positive (with debate over the size) but economists have generally downplayed the harmful effects. Most obviously, the loss of jobs in coal, steel and other manufacturing activities are argued to be caused by free trade.\nDani Rodrik, a Harvard professor, has for years been waging a lonely battle warning about the dangers of ignoring the losers from free trade. He is at pains never to give succour to crude protectionists but does occasionally run the risk of falling into that trap. He recently looked at the accumulated evidence of the winners and losers from Nafta, taking issue with Brad DeLong, a professor at University of California, Berkeley, who Rodrik thinks exaggerates the gains and minimises the losses.\nBoth economists actually agree about much: the US economy has benefited but jobs have been lost. Most importantly, they both think that anything Trump does to try to bring jobs back from Mexico (or anywhere else for that matter) is doomed to failure. Their disagreements revolve around how much to worry about the losers from free trade.\nAt the heart of all of this is a collapse in manufacturing employment. In the 1950s, almost one in three US workers were in manufacturing jobs. Now it is fewer than one in 11. Similar trends have been seen in many countries, including the UK and even Germany. What caused this?\nHe accuses Rodrik of being an \u201cenabler\u201d of that blame game. Strong"}

The administration offered the top ORR job to Lim\u00f3n, who had run the office during the Clinton administration. She turned it down, but recommended her deputy, Eskinder Negash.\nUnder Negash, money flowed heavily to USCRI. In 2011, when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops lost a major contract to do human trafficking work, the bulk of the money went to USCRI instead. It didn't go unnoticed.\n\"ORR earmarked most of the money for USCRI,\" Sister Mary Ann Walsh wrote at the time. \"Eskinder Negash, current director of the ORR, had been vice-president and chief operating officer at USCRI before joining ORR in 2009.\"\nNegash left the government last year, landing back at USCRI. His closeness to USCRI was so well known that the new head of ORR, Bob Carey, joked about it at a meeting with advocates shortly after taking over.\nNot mentioned is that the scheme funneling money to all the groups involved is both illegal and unconstitutional. More shocking though is the deliberate claim by the Cultural Marxist author, Grim, that funding for attorneys for illegal aliens is mandated by law.\nAlthough the law dictates that these children must be given legal services, recent moves by the Office of Refugee Resettlement have thrown that into doubt.\nFirst, the scheme violates the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution and the Anti-Deficiency Act, both which prohibit spending of funds that are not appropriated by Congress.\nThis is all thanks though to the failure of cucks Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to stop both the ongoing Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty through riders to the latest appropriations bill. Ryan and McConnell will not stand up for even Congresses authority to control spending, much less control immigration laws."}

It's based on the first crime novel in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. Stieg Larsson was a journalist whose trilogy was published posthumously. The books made him one of the best-selling authors in the world. This film also has become one the biggest grossing movies in European cinema. When on the Charlie Rose show, its Danish director, Niels Arden Oplev, described the movie as playing like a modern Agatha Christie mystery but with a dark angel at its center, an attraction in and of herself.\nOplev also made the connections that this film is a Scandinavian The Silence of the Lambs meets La Femme Nikita. It features Noomi Rapace who stars as Lisbeth Salander, a young woman who has short black hair, black eye makeup, black clothes, two nose rings, multiple piercings in one ear and who looks like a goth girl. She's fierce but works as a computer hacker and virtual spy.\nLisbeth is tasked with investigating a disgraced journalist named Mikael Blomkvist. Blomkvist leaves Stockholm to take a job by Henrik Vanger, a 82-year-old man who believes his niece who disappeared four decades ago is still alive, although everyone else in his family assume she's dead. Blomkvist accepts the job because Vanger's niece actually used to be his babysitter.\nAfter she's abused and raped, Lisbeth leaves her computer job and joins Blomkvist in his search for Vanger's niece. They uncover news reports of a possible serial killer going back to 1949. A Swedish cold case heats up. Without spoiling too much about the movie, Lisbeth and Blomkvist are able to catch the culprit using financial records and how the killer used his business to commit his crimes, and there's a great line that Lisbeth says, \"You think he got a tax deduction for murder?\"\nIt's a great line for one of the most interesting characters put on screen this year. Her actions make her the most interesting as well. People will certainly remember Lisbeth from now until the American remake of this movie comes out. Yet, the mystery that drives this movie forward may have an Agatha Christie feel is less of a draw than with what many American audiences may be satisfied.\nLisbeth has almost a separate storyline for about the first hour of this movie before her character teams up with Blomkvist. It's at that point that the movie really slows down. You get a lot of slow zooms and cross dissolves with black-and-white photos from 1966. There is a brief love affair and a setup for the next movie about Lisbeth's revenge by fire, but I wasn't that impressed with the serial killer reveal.\nSweden is seen as a great country for human rights, but Larsson, through his book, wanted to show that there are dark parts to Sweden, including Nazi connections and violence against women. I think this film is a good realization of that and a fairly decent adaptation, but it was perhaps too long.\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. and 32 mins.\nThursday, Sept. 23 at 1:30 p.m.\nFriday, Sept. 24 at 11 a.m. and 7:45 p.m.\nSaturday, Sept. 25 at 4"}

The story is so predictable that after a point ennui sets in though humour occasionally makes one sit up.\nA film starring NTR is often enough to light up the screen. Somehow he is very subdued in Brindavanam and unenergetic as compared to his earlier films. Despite the action sequences which are orchestrated with special effects, NTR is very restrained. Normally he's full of josh leading to magic on the screen. Sadly, the same magic is missing from this film.\nKajal plays a bimbo, a role which must have been difficult for her to play, as she is a smart girl. As for Samantha, her role in this film is quite a fall from that of Jessie in Ye Maaya Chesaave. She has very little to do here. Still, both the girls look pretty in glamorous outfits as they romance NTR. Perhaps that was the main trigger to sign this film -- to star with NTR.\nEverything about the film is formulaic which may appeal to family audiences. Music by Thaman S is just about okay. Brindavanam starts off with an old melody Brindavanamadi ... (with the late NTR and Jamuna from the film Missamma) which is pleasing to hear. But after the yesteryear melody, the new Brindavanam dips into familiar terrain.\nOn the whole Brindavanam makes for a dull watch."}

So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension.\nThere were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.\nTogether with three other Fossil Free Stanford organizers, I had strategized for hours about how to respond to the anticipated excuses and delays. But rather than facing hostility when we met the senior assistant, he told us that Stanford was preparing to announce its divestment from the coal industry. The Stanford Board of Trustees had heeded our calls for action, accelerated its review process, and was nearing a decisive vote. I was shocked. Eighteen months of dedication had actually achieved results.\nOur group, Fossil Free Stanford, was founded in November of 2012 as part of a national and international campaign calling on universities and other institutions to divest their endowments from the fossil fuel industry. The movement was inspired by Bill McKibben\u2019s incisive article in Rolling Stone, which provided a call to action and highlighted the terrifying fact that 80 percent of proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground in order to slow climate change to a rate that avoids the most catastrophic consequences. The movement for divestment gave my generation, for the first time, a tangible way to take action against climate change. Within months, divestment campaigns had sprung up at more than 300 colleges across the country.\nGet access to more illuminating stories like this one with a digital subscription to The Progressive magazine.\nSubscribe today and get one full year online for just $10!\nStanford\u2019s campaign began with a small group of passionate students and a goal of compelling our university to spear-head a global movement. Led by Sophie Harrison, a remarkable freshman, we researched Stanford\u2019s official policies for evaluating divestment. Our first concrete step was to submit a request for review to the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing, a body created during the apartheid divestment campaign of the 1980s to advise the board of trustees.\nAs we navigated the bureaucratic process, momentum toward divestment continued to build within the student body. We created a student petition and went door to door, asking for signatures. The petition allowed us not only to demonstrate student support, but also to engage with and educate our peers. We explained that while divestment would have little direct impact on the share prices of fossil fuel companies, it could fundamentally shift the public and political dialogue on climate change. By divesting, we would begin to align our investments with our values, send the powerful and unequivocal message that climate change is a profoundly moral issue, and make clear to policymakers that doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry is no longer acceptable.\nWhile our contact with the advisory panel continued, the administration held its cards close, and we were uncertain of the precise timeline for its decision-making process. In the fall of 2013, we were given less than one week\u2019s notice that we would have the opportunity to deliver our case to the full advisory panel.

There's not enough time to read all of them and run your business. So we've come up with a list of the top seven marketing books.\nOur list of books is in the order we recommend they be read. Topping the list is the classic that was named as the most important marketing concept of the 20th century in Advertising Age, the advertising industry's leading publication.\nThis is an obscure and very short novel written in 1929 about a successful businessman. The book was mentioned in another book I read. It wasn't available on Amazon because it was long out of print, but I found a used copy on eBay for 50 cents (shipping was $2.50!). The book is about common sense and parallels some of positioning's concepts. I gave my copy of the book to Jack Trout during one of his visits to the agency and asked him to read it on his flight back home.\nDisappointed that I didn't hear anything from Trout about the book for a couple of years, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a copy of his 15th book, \"In Search of the Obvious.\" He dedicated the book to me and made our agency a little famous. In the book, Jack says, referring to Obvious Adams, \"The best book that I have ever read on marketing.\"\nThe most current book on our list, published in 2017, was written by A.G. Lafley, who was CEO of Procter & Gamble twice, and Roger Martin, the former dean of the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. The two have collaborated on strategy at P&G for years. Their book lays it all out \u2014 not hypotheticals, but real life.\nTogether, they doubled P&G's sales, quadrupled its profits and increased its market value by more than $100 billion.\nThis book explores what the truly creative folks do that's almost magical when it comes to marketing execution.\nThis is the bible for everyone who works in advertising. David Ogilvy is considered the father of advertising. His tenure coincided with the \"Mad Men\" days. You will develop an understanding and appreciation for what works and what doesn't and why.\nNorthwestern University's Distinguished Professor of Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management authors a non-textbook book for the businessperson. He covers a lot of territory using examples from just about every marketplace.\nAn alternative, if you're so inclined, is Kotler's, \"Marketing Management\" (17th edition), a 700-page college textbook. You won't find a more comprehensive and up-to-date textbook. It can also serve as good reference.\nThis book is a breath of fresh air. Neumeier defines a brand as a person's gut feeling about your product, service or company. He says we're all emotional, intuitive beings, despite our best efforts to be rational.\nWe couldn't agree more. The book is a fun read and visually delightful. You won't put it down. As with David Ogilvy's book, your comfort with marketing and advertising will grow.\nWe end our list with a book on marketing strategy.

Featuring Tom Arnold, Jon Favreau, Ashton Kutcher and Bradley Cooper, the film is currently on the festival circuit and seeking distribution. Check out the trailer after the jump.\nAs a fan of films filled with inside Hollywood jokes, I think Brother\u2019s Justice certainly has potential. If Shepard and co-director David Palmer are able to blend biting cultural commentary with the obvious physical goofs that the premise lends itself too, there\u2019s no reason the film can\u2019t be a hilarious exercise in meta.\nWhat I find more fascinating, though, is how this film is another example of the cultural significance of Punk\u2019d. In recent years, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s MTV show has turned into a punchline, but it certainly was an incredible Hollywood springboard. B.J. Novak, for example, went from the candid camera show to writing and executive producing The Office and starring in Inglourious Basterds. Ryan Pinkston turned it into a nice little career with roles in Spy Kids 3D, Bad Santa and a bunch of TV. Shepard, however, was the breakout star, using the show to acquire starring roles in Idiocracy, Zathura, Employee of the Month and he even married his When In Rome co-star, Veronica Mars herself, Kristin Bell. He\u2019s currently on the NBC show Parenthood.\nAnd now he\u2019s used all of those connection to make his own movie. And whether or not the film is good, the fact remains, the guy made a movie. You\u2019ve got to give him respect for that, right?\nWhat do you make of this trailer? Does it make you want to see it or do you feel the mockumentary genre is totally played out?"}

The flavors were exciting and the aromas enchanting, unlike anything they had ever tasted before. But to be truly palatable to most British settlers, these centuries-old recipes needed to be \u2018reimagined\u2019 with a little bit of good old British flavour fundamentals. This lead to the foundations of what we now know as \u2018Anglo-Indian\u2019 cuisine, a hallmark of India\u2019s culture of acceptance and co-existence.\n3 layers of sponge cake (300g), available in the market, or can be made at home too.\nPlace three layers of sponge soaked lightly in orange liquor. Sandwich the layers with fresh whipped cream mixed with strawberries, grapes, banana, and orange chunks. Top up with another layer of whipped cream and fruits. Use a strainer to dust the dish with castor sugar and decorate with cherries. Pudding is ready to serve.\nThe British mellowed down and anglicised certain Indian dishes with acceptable levels of spice and tweaked some of their signature English meals with Indian flavours, informs Ajit Singh, MD at Anglow, New Delhi. \u201cThe Anglo-Indian cuisine was relished in formal settings and on evenings when English sahibs, Indian Princes and bejewelled ladies would gather together to enjoy the finest whiskeys and wines, and the elaborate and extensive menus each night, prepared laboriously by the cooks were only outdone by others the next night. Their fare was honed to perfection at quintessential colonial institutions like gentleman\u2019s clubs, railway kitchens, and Army messes,\u201d explains Singh.\nThe Anglo-Indian cuisine is quite distinct from the regular Indian cuisine essentially because of its wide variety of ingredients. And even though the dishes are quite peculiar, they would never fade out because a number of Anglo-Indian dishes have now become staple Indian dishes, says Akshay Nayyar, head chef of Anglow.\n\u201cA number of authentic British dishes spiked with Indian flavours or Indian dishes with an addition or two of British ingredients and mellow spices is what makes this cuisine different. Anglo-Indian itself being a fusion cuisine doesn\u2019t really have set recipes or ingredients for that matter. A number of Anglo-Indian dishes are made using the oven and it is almost impossible to make some of the most popular dishes without it. The British were the ones to get white bread, pastries, roasts etc to India, and now there are vegetarian variations of it in the cuisine,\u201d says Nayyar, citing examples of some Anglo-Indian classics.\n\u201cA railway curry, for example, is made with either vegetables, mutton or chicken and sometimes even with cottage cheese. And the railway curry always differs in taste when had in Delhi, Kolkata or Chennai. Another really popular dish in Britain is Kedgeree. Open cheese toasts, shami kebabs and deviled eggs are an extremely popular choice in both the defence messes as well as a number of the colonial clubs in the country. Anglo-Indian dishes are by and large very easy to prepare at home and don\u2019t usually require heavyweights in the kitchen to dish out. They also tend to have a very simple and delicate taste and are almost universally palatable,\u201d he explains.\nChutneys were yet another amazing creation of the British and Indian cooks"}

Here are some tips for changing up your living room without having to spend more than you can.\nColour is one of the most noticeable elements in decor and is pretty much the easiest thing to change. The colour of your living room\u2019s walls can drastically change the look of the room: a dark, rich burgundy adds a touch of antiquity, while a bright yellow can make it look hip and modern. Painting is also very budget-friendly; all you really need is paint, primer, tape and a brush.\nTechnically speaking, you don\u2019t have to add anything to your living room at all. Our eyes often get accustomed to the layout of home; by simply shuffling and rotating your furniture, your living room will automatically look new. In the process of rotation, you can move ornaments around, or borrow from other rooms too. Even though a prize-winning interior designer would be awesome, you do not exactly need one to remodel your living room. Just think fresh!\nAdding some nature to your living room can go a long way in budget-friendly remodelling projects. Whether you choose to go with live plants or plastic ones, plants can add life to empty corners and completely change the feel of your living room.

{"idx": "1490", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Immediate termination occurs due to serious offenses by employees.\nThe shift from conservative attire to business casual attire in the workplace is more difficult than many employers believed it would be, due to the ambiguous nature of the term \"business casual.\" Consequently, employers routinely address concerns about inappropriate workplace attire, which in some cases, can be a sensitive topic to broach. Implementing a dress code and showing employees the effects of dressing inappropriately for work is the beginning of encouraging employees to dress in a professional, yet relaxed manner.\nReview your employee handbook and workplace policies for dress code guidelines. Expand your policy based on your company's desired workplace attire. For example, if your reference to business casual isn't fully explained in the policy, describe what constitutes business casual. Prepare an employee presentation to review the revised policy. Use a multimedia format that includes visual examples of acceptable versus unacceptable workplace attire. Include an explanation of how the revised dress code policy will be incorporated into your organization's disciplinary policy.\nProvide employees with a copy of the written policy, including the visual presentations. Obtain signed acknowledgments from your employees that indicate they received and understand the new or revised workplace policy.\nSet a date for your dress code policy to become effective; however, tell employees they should immediately begin dressing more appropriately for the workplace. Stress the importance of dressing well for the sake of professionalism and respect from customers and clients. Inform employees of the specific date on which dress code violations will be addressed through disciplinary action. Give employees at least two to three weeks -- this provides enough time for employees to purchase clothing that's suitable for work over the course of a pay period.\nProvide leadership training to supervisors and managers on how to address employees who continually violate the company policy. Use experiential learning techniques to engage supervisors in role-play on how to coach employees about inappropriate workplace attire. Reinforce your leadership training with accountability measures for supervisors and managers -- hold them accountable for enforcing the company's dress code.\nSchedule a time to meet with individual employees who have questions about inappropriate attire. Address their concerns from the standpoint that inappropriate attire can cause a decline in employee performance and morale. Explain that attire that draws too much attention to the employee can be distracting -- employees who witness their co-workers continually violate the dress code policy may lose respect for the employees, as well as the supervisors who fail to enforce the policy. In addition, explain that employees' opportunities for advancement might depend on professional appearance and adherence to workplace policies on dressing appropriately.\nConsider company logo attire for implementing a casual or business casual dress code. Price the cost of company logo attire and determine the return on investment in the company purchasing polo shirts or t-shirts for employees compared to quantifiable effects of inappropriate attire, such as lost work time for sending employees home for egregious violations of the dress code.\nLook into alternatives if your company is upgrading to a more professional dress code, especially if your employees aren't accustomed to dressing in more upscale fashion. Weigh the options of providing employees with an allowance to subsidize clothing purchases, contacting retail stores for special pricing or engaging the services of an image consultant to talk to employees about upgrading their wardrobes.\nMayhew, Ruth. \"How to Address Inappropriate Attire in the Workplace.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/address-inappropriate-attire-workplace-24258.html.

In New York, US Attorney and Prosecutor, Preet Bharara, has already won 56 convictions out of 63 cases where Wall Street traders have been charged with offenses like insider trading and securities fraud \u2014 activities which, if unchecked, enrich the perpetrators beyond one\u2019s wildest imaginings, and obstruct access to investing opportunities on the part of other investors. He has already seen several of these erstwhile paragons of capitalist success being imprisoned in the wake of his relentless investigations, and he has not lost a single case.\nPerhaps this is what the world of high finance needs \u2014 someone (working with a team of dedicated staff) to remind them that greed sometimes (not often enough, yet, though) has a price to pay. And it is a reminder that the insatiable beast of capitalism CAN be reined in, if representatives of the state \u2014 in this case, its prosecuting arm \u2014 have the guts to take the bull by the horns."}

It was difficult, however, to find evidence that the ultrafine particles were from China as such particles found in China and those found in South Korea were similar in their components. China also took a stance that scientific evidence is necessary to prove that the ultrafine particles in South Korea were from China.\nThe Korean research team has focused on the fact that a considerable amount of ultrafine particles is generated during the Chinese New year as a result of fireworks. During the Chinese New Year, the concentration of ultrafine particles on the Korean Peninsula appeared to be generally \u201cbad,\u201d with 51\u223c100\u03bcg (1\u03bcg is one-millionth of a gram) per m\u00b3.\nAs such, the research team has developed a system to gauge two types of concentration \u2013 potassium and laevoglucose \u2013 among components of ultrafine particles. While potassium is emitted when burning both fireworks and biomass, laevoglucose is only emitted when burning biomass. As a result of observation, potassium concentration skyrocketed by more than seven times during the Chinese New Year period whereas laevoglucose concentration did not change. In other words, the research result has proved that Chinese-born ultrafine particles flow into South Korea.\nThe Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources investigated and revealed that 87 percent of heavy metals in yellow dust in South Korea was from China in 2016 but the latest research result is the first time to secure basis of ultrafine particles inflow from China."}

He has owned the property for about five years.\nHe said he does not currently have an estimate for how much the development will be worth once complete.\nWhile most, if not all, council members would agree that declaring blight is the right call for some properties that would otherwise remain dilapidated or underused, the economic development tool is becoming increasingly controversial for other areas.\nOne main concern is if tax breaks are awarded for property that would be redeveloped anyway, local taxing jurisdictions may lose out on millions of dollars of future revenue.\nCity staff is in the process of working with some council members on placing stricter guidelines on what kinds of redevelopment plans would be approved for tax abatements.\nNew guidelines may place more emphasis on new developments that provide benefits for the community, such as being environmentally friendly or generate sales tax revenue."}

I do this every week as it is impossible to see everything just one or two times through a game. Many will judge off of a stat sheet and it is what sets this site apart from the rest as we actually watch the games more than just one time.\nThe Patriots were so protective against the long ball early on that is opened up the middle of the field for Heath Miller and Ben Roethlisberger took it. The Steelers only had a few explosive plays of 20 yards or more on the day because of this, but it did not matter.\nThe Steelers did to the Patriots what most teams try to do to then and that is spread it out.\nThe offensive line has a lot of continuity now since Max Starks has returned. The 5 sacks allowed Sunday is a deceiving number, considering 2 looked like they freely allowed on the last drive. Roethlisberger looked like he stepped into another one. Run blocking was adequate and I am sure it will flush out in the offensive line breakdown this week.\nEmmanuel Sanders had another two great blocks by my count out on the edge and you can see why he started for Hines Ward.\nRoethlisberger would have had an even better day had he gotten a few of his throws up. I think on maybe 3 of them, the receiver was wide open.\nMewelde Moore always makes a play or two a game when he is in there.\nThe 3 and out forced by the defense after the offense marched down for an opening drive touchdown was pretty big and set the tone for the day.\nThe Steelers only ran 5 times on their first two long drives and that had the Patriots defense on their heels the rest of the game.\nThe defensive pass interference call on William Gay might have been deserved, but it was very, very late. Make the call if you see it.\nThe man across coverage was a thing of beauty along with press coverage. They mixed in Ryan Mundy and rookie Cortez Allen down in the slot and both got their share of covering tight end Rob Gronkowski. Ike Taylor got a good share of coverage on Wes Welker as well. The Steelers played more man than we have seen in a long, long time.\nRoethlisberger saw Gary Guyton on the interception, but still forced the ball in there I think. Had he gotten rid of it a half a second quicker, he likely would have been fine. That interception really let the Patriots back in it by giving them a short field. Hard to knock Keenan Lewis on the touchdown as that route was tough to defend and Tom Brady put that ball where only Deion Branch could catch it.\nThe defense was getting pressure with 3 and 4 pass rushers and only blitzed on 13 pass plays by my count. The pressure had Brady on the move a few times and out of the pocket.\nI talked about YAC before the game quite a bit and Wes Welker was held to a total of 3 yards after the catch on his 6 catches. 91 yards of YAC on the day in total by my count on 24 receptions. Not a bad average in total and 38 of it came on 2 catches by Gronkowski.\nI do not understand why Brady did not try to go no huddle more and catch the Steelers early on in their base defense. It was the best chance at a good mismatch, but I suppose the crowd noise may have had something to do with it"}

Because there were seven in our party, we were at a large table set down the center of the room.\nMany customers sitting in the first dining room appeared to be pizza-directed, and the menu is heavily weighted on that front. Pies range from the basics to build your own, with a long list of toppings from sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, broccoli and eggplant to cherry peppers, jalape\u00f1os and pineapple. Specialty pizzas included the likes of Philly cheese steak, pesto, clams casino, potato and moussaka. The list is long.\nIf the pizza list was daunting, the entr\u00e9e selection nearly overwhelmed. The menu takes up five large, full pages, plus an insert with daily specials. All entr\u00e9es are served with soup or salad and a choice of grinder rolls, plain or toasted with garlic. Service was excellent.\nWe started with a large order of whole belly clams to pass and share. They turned out to be predominately strips, helped by a few bellies. The latter were on the small side, but enjoyable nonetheless. Broiled seafood such as salmon, sole, shrimp and scallops came in various disguises, with a lengthy array of pastas available on the sides.\nMost of us ordered salads with assorted dressings. The greens were crisp, fresh and decorated with sliced cucumbers, grape tomatoes and shredded carrots. I ordered the soup du jour, pasta fagiole.

Chicken or veal could be had finished with piccata, francaise, Marsala or Parmesan sauces. All portions were quite generous and could be ordered with ziti, shells or spaghetti.

The sauce contained a thickener, probably cornstarch or flour, but was not discernable by taste.\nFrom the list of specials, veal osso bucco minus the bones offered a window into what the kitchen could do.

A lumpsucker farm in Shetland, for example, supplies lumpsucker cleaner fish raised from eggs supplied from a caviar factory in Iceland.\nAn adult female lumpsucker can reach 60cm. Coming inshore to spawn, she sticks herself firmly to a rock, impervious to Atlantic swells and storms. She lays a large mass of eggs \u2013 up to 136,000 \u2013 and then retires to deeper water, leaving the male to look after them for weeks.\nThe more I learn about lumpfish caviar the more I\u2019m now inclined to forgo this Christmas morsel (best washed down, I\u2019m told, with vodka). Female fish caught with inshore gill nets, notably along coasts of Greenland and Iceland, are gutted for their roe, then discarded overboard. The eggs are taken ashore in barrels to be desalted and salted again to market taste, pasteurised and dyed red or black, with EU-approved preservatives.\nHow, after all, did I think ersatz \u201ccaviar\u201d was produced at prices a fraction of the real stuff from wild sturgeon of the Caspian Sea?

Free-range parents base the amount of freedom their children receive on how much responsibility they can handle. In the Meitiv case, the children had a curfew and were expected home by 6:30 p.m., a reasonable hour when it\u2019s still fully light outside. When they didn\u2019t come home, the parents drove around the neighborhood frantically looking for them. They did were not notified of their children\u2019s whereabouts until 8 p.m.\nThis is an outrageous and sickening abuse of power that really should be hitting the news as \u201cPolice kidnap children.\u201d This is state-sponsored kidnapping. From what, exactly, were they intending to protect those children? The claim about a homeless man nearby is hardly substantial if all he was doing was looking at them. It appears more as if the police have been looking for an opportunity to harass this family, to the profound detriment of the children, who will likely be deeply affected by such a traumatizing incident.\nHow dare the state think that raising independent, self-reliant, and aware children is a crime? The way in which the majority of North American children are being raised nowadays \u2013 parked in front of screens for hours on end with minimal parental interaction and almost no time spent exploring outdoors \u2013 is what should be punished. Those are the truly irresponsible parents, who are unwilling to take the natural risks associated with raising well-rounded, confident individuals and who prefer to keep their children guarded, trapped, and fearfully indoors all the time.\nIf the police are so worried about the dangers of that particular neighborhood, then it appears they have their work cut out for them. How about addressing those issues, rather than wasting resources and time kidnapping other people\u2019s children under the guise of protecting them?"}
{"idx": "1515", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On Jan. 31, the governments of France, Germany and the United Kingdom formally announced the establishment of the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a Special Purpose Vehicle dedicated to facilitating trade between European economic actors and Iran. The creation of INSTEX by the three countries\u2014known as the E3\u2014followed months of negotiations in the wake of the United States\u2019s 2018 exit from the Iran nuclear deal. That deal lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran imposing restrictions on its nuclear program. Following its exit from the deal, the U.S. reimposed \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions that prohibit American companies from doing business with foreign companies that do business in Iran.\nWhile operational details for INSTEX still need to be defined, the vehicle\u2019s underlying objective is to facilitate payment transactions among European and Iranian businesses outside the parameters of the U.S. financial system, which would have to be used if any transactions in U.S. dollars were involved\u2014consequently subjecting any banks facilitating such transactions to U.S. sanctions. At a minimum, INSTEX will oversee a ledger of payments related to exports and imports between Europe and Iran, coordinating payments so that a European exporter of goods to Iran can get paid by a European importer of goods from Iran and thereby avoid entering into a cross-border transaction. An Iranian counterpart to INSTEX would coordinate payments between the Iranian transaction parties. While such a model would admittedly cover only a small portion of Iran\u2019s trades (exports would always have to equal imports in order for the payment transactions to balance out), the hope among many involved with the creation of INSTEX is that it would eventually process all payments among trading participants, functioning more like a bank as opposed to an intermediary focused on pairing export and import liabilities.\nThe emergence of a financial intermediary vehicle that exists beyond the U.S. financial system has potentially adverse implications for U.S. sanctions policy. Much of the United States\u2019s ability to pressure foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business in Iran\u2014as well as other sanctioned countries\u2014derives from the reliance of global economic actors on access to the U.S. financial system for cross-border transactions. Despite this, American officials have, at least in public, been largely muted in their reactions to the announcement of the plan, stressing that, while they are \u201cclosely following\u201d reports on the European mechanism, they do not expect it to impinge on U.S. efforts to exert maximum economic pressure on Iran. Many experts have in fact expressed a lack of confidence in INSTEX\u2019s prospects based on the assumption that its personnel and operation could easily be made subject to additional U.S. sanctions.\nAlthough it is hard to say exactly how INSTEX will affect U.S. sanctions policy until more details about its structure are revealed, there are several key issues that U.S. policymakers ought to consider sooner rather than later in evaluating how to contend with the development of the vehicle. First, it will be politically more difficult for the U.S. to penalize INSTEX and its participants for engaging in problematic activity in the event INSTEX actually does become commercially successful. A thriving INSTEX would mean more European businesses with a vested interest in building commercial ties with Iran, which would consequently place greater pressure on European governments not to yield to American economic pressure without any pushback. The effort by the E3 to establish INSTEX is itself partly the result of pressure from European companies that entered the Iranian market following the execution of the Iran deal and are eager to continue doing business.\nSecond, the United States"}

It also stretches inland to take in the mining town of Collinsville. The electorate is centred on the agricultural areas around Ayr-Home Hill, but also includes the outskirts of Townsville, taking in built up areas south and east of the Ross River including Wulguru and the Lavarack Army Barracks.\nFirst created in 1950, Burdekin was held by Independent Arthur Coburn from 1950 until his retirement in 1969. The seat was then a safe National Party seat, held by Val Bird 1969-83 and Mark Stoneman from 1983 to 1998 when the seat fell to One Nation's Jeff Knuth. Like all the One Nation MPs, Knuth left the party during his term, contesting the 2001 election for the City Country Alliance. Knuth finished in third place, at least having the solace of outpolling the new One Nation candidate, but with 60% of One Nation and City Country Alliance preferences exhausting, the Labor Party's Steve Rodgers surprisingly became Burdekin's first Labor MP. Rodgers' victory was entirely due to optional preferential voting, polling only 36.7% of the first preference vote compared to a combined 63.3% for his three conservative opponents.\nIn 2004, Rodgers retained his primary vote, but stronger flows of preferences between conservative candidates produced a 9.5% swing to the National Party, electing current MP Rosemary Menkens. Rogers contested the seat again in 2006 and achieved a 2% swing to Labor, but not enough to defeat Menkens. Burdekin had not been marginal before the 1992 redistribution, when the addition of areas on the edge of Townsville increased the seat's Labor vote. The 1999 redistribution added the Labor-voting mining town of Collinsville, and the 2008 redistribution added Bowen, turning Burdekin into a notional Labor seat again. However Menkens gained a 4% swing at the 2009 election and was easily re-elected to Parliament.\nNickson holds a Master\u2019s degree in Social Work, is a qualified Justice of the Peace and is currently a Lecturer at James Cook University. She has lived and worked in the region for nearly 20 years and has held positions in different areas of the field of social work and been a national Board Member of the Australian Association of Social Workers.

His remaining businesses are near \u201cthe brink of collapse,\u201d with banks no longer wanting to lend to him and as he has lost business.

The companies spent nearly eight months negotiating with Treasury to significantly reduce Deripaska\u2019s influence in order to have sanctions lifted.\nDemocrats and some Republicans pushed back against the sanctions rollback because of Deripaska\u2019s influence in the Russian power and metals industries and for his ties to Vladimir Putin.\nIn his suit, Deripaska rejected any link to 2016 election issues being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\u201cThere is simply no evidence Deripaska is involved in the Russian government\u2019s activities,\u201d he said.\nDeripaska has longstanding ties to a key figure in the Mueller investigation, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Manafort, who was to 7.5 years in prison for conspiracy and other crimes.\nCourt filings in Mueller\u2019s investigation showed that when FBI agents searched Manafort\u2019s belongings for evidence related to a $10 million loan Deripaska made to Manafort.

I have an app (cardio trainer) that I use to keep track of my mileage when I run or ruck. It also keeps track of calories burned but obviously it is not the primary reason for my workouts. It is a fun motivator though. My question is, do you know of any sort of calorie conversion for ruck marching? The app tells me how many I burned for walking 5 miles (and I realize that is just an estimate, but I assume I burn a lot more calories carrying a 40 pound ruck the same distance. It would just be fun to know how many?\nGreat question and thanks! I do not know the weighted walk conversions BUT I would guess it would be similar to if you weighed an extra 40 lbs you would burn more calories. As you know a 250 lbs person burns more calories walking than a 200 lbs person.\nI just went to a calorie calculator online and did a 60 min walk at 4 miles per hour for my weight of 200lbs \u2014 I burn 468 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 585 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100\u2013150 calories by adding a 40\u201350 lb back pack to a 4 mph walk.\nSince walking with a ruck at 4mph is the bare minimum standards for military rucking \u2014 here is a good test if you put out a little more. Try 5mph or a 12 min mile with 40lbs. Still not blazing fast but a better indicator of effort with /\u200b without a ruck. If you input a 60 min jog at 5 miles per hour for a weight of 200lbs \u2014 I burn 768 calories. With 50lb pack I would weigh 250lbs and I would burn 960 calories for the same pace.\nSo it looks like you can add in 100\u2013200 calories by adding a 40\u201350 lb back pack to a fast walk/\u200bjog depending on your weight and pace.\nNow there is a calorie burning standard for backpacking, which is typically a weighted stroll at a much slower pace of 1\u20132 mph. At my weight of 200 lbs, I burned 670 calories \u201cbackpacking\u201d and 840 calories burned if I place an extra 50lbs on me. So \u2014 yes it makes sense that you would burn more calories by either going faster than \u201cbackpacking pace\u201d which I would average out at 4\u20135 mph as well as when you are carrying even more weight in a ruck.\nSo a precise answer is tough as this is a bit all over the place. I think a safe calorie estimate for rucking with 40-\u200b\u200b50lbs is to add 40 \u2014 50% to what a walking /\u200b jogging calorie burn would be at that pace. So if you are burning 450 calories just walking at 4mph, then you would add 180\u2013225 calories to that number of 450 and get roughly 630 \u2014 675 calories burned an hour with rucking."}

In doing so, it would have dropped far beyond what any rational analysis of events called for.\nFear hasn't exactly been in the saddle, but its foot was in the stirrup.\nThe Western world -- particularly America -- has just gone through one of those periods when large numbers of its citizens seem almost to enjoy talking up their fears -- of terrorism, of travel abroad, of radioactive fallout, of unfair trading partners.\nIn some parts of Europe, anti-Americanism rose to a higher level than during the period of debate about Pershing and cruise missiles. And in America there was an undercurrent of recrimination about letting an allegedly unsafe and pusillanimous Western Europe go its own way.\nFortunately, the excesses of rhetoric and anxiety hectoring the two sides of the Atlantic seem to be subsiding. Name-calling between Moscow and Washington appears to be subsiding somewhat as well. The Roentgen count of fear is dropping along with the radiation count in Western Europe.\nNone of the causes of this ``fear-athon'' were to be taken lightly. That is obvious where radioactive fallout is concerned.\nUnfair trade practices (and retaliation against them) are also known to create long-term damage to employment and income. And rashes of terrorism, whether driven by anarchism or exported guerrilla war, if not stopped tend to feed on each other and on publicity.\nTerror attacks also feed on the smug expectation by conspirators that they can outthink big, clumsy governments.\nThere is, however, a difference between dealing seriously with such problems and indulging in the delicious thrill of chicken little-ism. Both leaders and citizens added to the latter.\nOn the terrorism front, President Reagan and his advisors seemed to ignore sensible European questions about the ultimate effectiveness of military action against Libya.\nAnd West European leaders helped bring on that action by vacillating over economic sanctions against Libya. Then, leaders on both sides of the pond did little to allay the anti-Europeanism and anti-Americanism that resulted.\nEven at their Tokyo summit, the Western leaders took few steps to repair this outburst of chauvinism, even though they wrestled for days on how to combat bomb planters.\nIt's not surprising, given this lack of leadership, that a trade delegation from Washington State cancelled its tour of European cities last week because of fear about safety in Europe.\nReagan might start the repairs by devoting his next Saturday broadcast to reassuring American tourists and business travelers about safety in much of Western Europe -- as well as the underlying pro-Americanism of the majority of Europeans.\nEuropean leaders could follow suit by speaking out bluntly against the misconception that Washington is dragging them closer to war -- and pettishly discouraging tourists.\nBut isn't it, in fact, dangerous for Americans to travel in Europe?\nThe question reminds me of the situation of a Vietnamese politician whom I know. He had been jailed by the Diem government and was later injured by a bomb planted in his car, presumably by the Vietcong. He was daily surrounded by a ferocious guerrilla war.\nBut when he was invited to go to the US for a speaking tour in 1968, just after the assassination of Martin Luther King, his wife pleaded with him not to go to America because it was too dangerous!

We\u2019ve all seen our dogs do the stop, drop and roll.\nStop: I smell something disgusting!\nDrop: I must schmooze my face alllll over it!\nRoll: I must embrace the full disgustingness of the stankiness with my entire body! Yes! Yessss!\nFrom this we get the perfect zombie disguise.\nThis is the best disguise for your dogs to use against zombies because the dogs will now smell just like walkers. In an early Walking Dead episode, Rick and Glenn covered themselves in killed zombie guts so they could go out among the walkers undetected, and it worked.\nFor full protection from zombie cooties, here\u2019s where the onesies come in. You must train the dogs to roll in the nasty stuff only when they\u2019re wearing their special apocalypse gear so that the gunk doesn\u2019t get on their fur.\nWhen the dog onesies are soaked in gross, stinky stuff, do not wash them. Simply hang them on low hooks around the house so your dogs can wriggle into them before venturing outside. Dogs can be taught to dress themselves \u2014 some even come by it naturally.\nDogs can run circles around anything, so confusing walkers should be no problem. A single dog can circle a walker until it gets dizzy and falls over (the walker, not the dog), and two or more dogs can confuse an entire pack of walkers, giving the dogs plenty of time to make an escape. Even a medium-sized dog can knock over a healthy person, so with the right training, it can easily knock walkers over.\nOur larger dog can hurl herself across the living room, land on a sofa weighing half a ton and shove it back toward the windows, creating an effective barricade. With your guidance, dogs can develop ideas on how to surf a sofa or bookcase or \u2014 with a little creativity \u2014 major appliance to block further walker access.\nSo teaching them to pile furniture or other household objects in front of doors and"}

{"idx": "1531", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Every parent has had that embarrassing experience \u2014 a mad, screaming, crying, or pouting child in a public place. Do you yell, threaten, ignore, or try to appease the child? Whatever you do, other people are looking. Dr. Diane Ross-Glazer has been there. She opens Parenting as a Second Language by telling the story of her daughter throwing a tantrum, and parents will be hooked from that page on.\nDr. Ross-Glazer knows we can\u2019t prevent our children from misbehaving in public, but we can lessen the damage by learning how to speak with them. And more importantly, we can learn to react in a way that will not emotionally damage them for the rest of their lives. Ordering a child to be quiet or reasoning with him is not always possible. Instead, we need to speak to children on their level, understanding and validating their feelings first so we can help them move past those feelings and into more acceptable behavior.\nMany times, people, even children, know what is logical to do, but our emotions get in the way. As a therapist who works with both parents and children, Dr. Ross-Glazer realized early on that using problem-solving logic wasn\u2019t a problem for most people. The problem is that people have lost touch with their feelings, lost the connection between the head and heart. This broken connection generally stems from childhood when they were taught to repress their feelings by adults who warned them not to act out or refused to listen to them. Dr. Ross-Glazer doesn\u2019t want to see the same thing happen to children today; repressed emotions, as she explains, result in emotional dysfunction in adulthood.\nDr. Ross-Glazer discusses many ways that parents, often unwittingly, break their child\u2019s head-heart connection, from trying to turn their musical child into an athlete, or simply through a poor word choice when explaining something to a child. Dr. Ross-Glazer learned this the hard way when she said, \u201cYuck\u201d whenever she changed her toddler\u2019s diaper until he told her he didn\u2019t like her saying that; she then suspected that he equated her not liking changing his diaper with him having to feel ashamed or not good about himself.\nPerhaps most important are the practical examples Dr. Ross-Glazer gives to talk to children. She presents a four-step formula for talking to your child in a difficult situation that will ensure you do not break children\u2019s head-heart connection but instead make them understand why things are what they are, whether it\u2019s why your child can\u2019t have a puppy or dealing with your child\u2019s irrational fear of balloons.\nUltimately, Dr. Ross-Glazer teaches parents how to teach kids the consequences of their bad behavior without shaming them, and how to get children to abide by rules. Parents learn how to use rules to their and their child\u2019s advantage without caving in during a weak moment or a temper tantrum. In the end, parents and children will both benefit because they\u2019ll understand each other better from speaking the same language.\nFor more information about Parenting as a Second Language and Dr. Diane Ross-Glazer, visit the author\u2019s website."}
{"idx": "1532", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Mark Latham is doing far better than anyone expected. No one had particular faith in him, though there was a bare majority in his caucus, if not in his party\u2019s machinery, who had the sense to recognise that a great gamble with an outside chance was more sensible than a low-risk, low-dividend Kim Beazley. But the signs, so far, are good. It\u2019s probably six months out from an election, but the polls put Labor well in front, and show Latham, personally, gaining in stature with the electorate. The doubters worried about his self-discipline; he has kept it. The doubters thought that a history of flirting with often contradictory ideas would make him vulnerable to parliamentary attack. The attacks have been made, but they have not seemed to work. John Howard does not seem able to get a fix on him, and often responds to Latham rather than making Latham go after him. This has weakened the Government\u2019s self confidence and faith in Howard as leader, although there is no evidence that Peter Costello is a surer bet. Indeed even Costello\u2019s supporters suspect that his unwillingness to wield the knife against Howard is a proof of incapacity, not only to use it more successfully on Latham, but to govern generally.\nJohn Howard has been in this fix before. Six months before the 2001 election he was in much the same position at the polls. Howard fights well with his back against the wall. At that time he dumped unpopular policies and not a little of his reputation for fiscal rectitude. He looted the Treasury to buy off key groups who were critical. He kept hammering away at a complacent Kim Beazley, who had imagined that government would fall into his lap, if only because the Howard Government had plainly run out of steam and ideas. And Howard was pulling back the margin well before two extraordinary bits of political luck came his way; the Tampa, and the events of September 11. Even in his exploitation of that luck, he left nothing to chance, quite happy to mislead the electorate, to misuse defence forces for crude politics, and to throw $1 billion away to save face over his Pacific solution. That Labor panicked and, seeking to neutralise Howard\u2019s issues, abandoned any moral right to govern was mere bonus. Howard does not panic, and, this time, does not even have any core agenda or principles to defend. He will do whatever is necessary to win, and is still better at calculating the chances than any of his rivals.\nHoward\u2019s problem as he sets his budget, is not how much money there is in the bank but how much credit he has, or more accurately, credibility. He\u2019s used a lot of it in areas where he has been regarded as stronger; national security, and management of the economy. It\u2019s not just children overboard or gilding the lily about weapons of mass destruction, though these are the areas where he has lost trust, not only among his enemies, who never believed him anyway, but in core constituencies. He\u2019s been spending his credibility with farmers, home buyers, school parents and hospital patients. The evidence is that an increasingly cynical electorate simply doesn\u2019t believe him any more. Even when Howard delivers, or gets some grudging credit, there is widespread suspicion of his motives. Mark Latham, moreover, seems to have some knack at wrong-footing Howard over symbolic politics right in the middle of the legend he is trying to sell, whether about values, or the Australian dream, or self-reliance.

It took around 10 years to complete due to funding issues and several alterations were made by Mackintosh during the process.\nMore than a century later, it still operates as a working building serving hundreds of students.\nIndications are the firefighters' efforts today have ensured more than 90% of the structure is \"viable'' and up to 70% of contents protected, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.\nAssistant Chief Officer Dave Boyle said: \"Crews have been working absolutely flat out throughout this very challenging incident and it is clear their effort and skill has saved this treasured building and many of the items it housed.\n\"While the priority from the outset was to save life we have also been working closely with Glasgow School of Art staff to ensure firefighters conducted an effective salvage operation.\nCrews will remain at the scene throughout the night dampening down hot spots, a spokeswoman for the fire service said.\nFlames could be seen through the scorched windows and billowing out of the roof of the sandstone building on the corner of the city's Renfrew Street and Scott Street as the fire took hold.\nLarge crowds gathered near the scene as multiple fire crews tackled the blaze, with several people crying as they watched the events unfold.\nBroadcaster Muriel Gray, a former student and current chairwoman of the school, was among those who burst into tears when she saw the building in flames.\nShe said: \"It's been an absolutely devastating day for everyone involved with the School of Art, students who are preparing for their degree show and all the staff.\n\"We just want to make it clear that we are so grateful to the fire service who responded within four minutes and there were no casualties which is the main thing that we were concerned about.\nIt is hoped that many of the students' work can be saved.\nThe fire prompted an outpouring of concern online from those connected to the school, or who hold affection for it.\nScotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said on Twitter that his thoughts were with staff and students.\nFran Healy, who studied at GSA before becoming lead singer of Travis, expressed his sadness.\nThe Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) tonight described the blaze as \"an international tragedy''.\n\"The most important work by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, an architect of international significance, Glasgow School of Art is held in the highest regard by architects and the public alike - it was rightly judged to be the best building of the past 175 years, in a nationwide poll run by the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nAlex Mis"}

While speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Farley said Bitcoin ETFs still have a ways to go before clearing the necessary regulatory hurdles.\nThere have been a number of efforts to get a Bitcoin ETF off the ground, along with gain similar acceptance for other cryptocurrencies but none of the attempts have proven successful thus far, falling short of gaining approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPerhaps the most notable failure thus far was the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, backed by twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame. The effort was rejected by the commission after it found the proposed fund was susceptible to fraud due to the digital currency\u2019s unregulated nature.\nThe concept behind the Winklevoss ETF and others like it is to create a stock fund tied to the price of Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), which would allow investors to purchase the currency without holding it directly. The fund would work in the same way that a person can investment money into another commodity like gold.\nETFs would have helped lower the barrier of entry that comes with the cryptocurrency, which can require some technical know-how. Currently, acquiring cryptocurrency requires people to create a unique bitcoin wallet and the ability to \u201cmine\u201d for bitcoin by lending their computing power to blockchain transactions.\nInvestors in a bitcoin ETF wouldn\u2019t be able to make purchases using Bitcoin but would be able to buy and sell it at its listed value, which would benefit the cryptocurrency economy by creating more liquidity in the market.\nThe SEC is still approaching cryptocurrencies with a critical eye. Earlier this month, the commission raised a number of investor protection concerns about cryptocurrency mutual funds and ETFs in a letter to industry groups.\nIn the letter, the SEC asked questions about the potential for currency manipulation, challenges regarding setting an accurate value for a product tied to volatile markets, and how demand to redeem the virtual currency would be met, among other questions."}

We Answer Three Key Questions.\nCOP24, the New Round of Global Climate Talks, Has Begun. We Answer Three Key Questions.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With the world still struggling to get global warming under control, diplomats from nearly 200 countries are scheduled to meet in Poland over the next two weeks to try to put global climate negotiations back on track.\nThe focus of the meeting? To hammer out a key set of rules for the Paris climate agreement that, delegates hope, will help prod countries to cut fossil-fuel emissions far more deeply in the years ahead than they\u2019re currently doing.\nUnder the Paris deal, signed by world leaders in 2015, virtually every country on Earth agreed to submit a plan for curbing emissions and vowed to ratchet up efforts over time. But key questions about how that process would unfold were left unanswered: How thoroughly should countries report their progress on emissions? How detailed should their plans for making further cuts be?\nDelegates at the conference \u2014 being held in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\u2019s coal-mining region, and which is known as COP24, shorthand for its formal name \u2014 will haggle over a \u201crule book\u201d that will lay out the answers to those and other key questions. The debates are often technical, but highly contentious: China, for instance, has suggested that developing countries should be held to looser reporting standards, but Europe and the United States have pushed back.\nThe stakes are high: While countries agreed in Paris to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, the plans that various countries have written so far are wildly insufficient to that task. Currently, the world is on pace for around 3 degrees Celsius of warming or more, bringing far higher risks of deadly heat waves, floods, the collapse of polar ice caps and other potential calamities.\nWhat\u2019s more, some countries are now backsliding. The Trump administration has disavowed the Paris deal and plans to pull the United States out by 2020, though the country will nonetheless send officials to Poland to participate in talks. Australia and Brazil also have newly elected leaders opposed to more forceful climate action, and some analysts are now finding signs of a \u201cTrump effect\u201d that could undermine global efforts on climate change.\nWhat\u2019s the point of these climate talks?\nTo understand the Katowice meeting, it\u2019s useful to recall that the Paris climate agreement was largely intended to work through peer pressure among nations.\nUnder the Paris agreement, countries aren\u2019t required to submit legally binding plans for reducing emissions. Instead, each country submits a voluntary plan tailored to its own domestic situation. This structure, the architects of the Paris deal said, was the most realistic way to get every world leader to agree to participate.\nBut those architects also realized that countries aren\u2019t doing nearly enough to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. So, under Paris, countries are required to meet periodically, assess their collective progress and see where stronger action can be taken. World leaders could then push each other to ratchet up their ambitions over time.\nBut for this peer-pressure dynamic to have any chance of working, analysts say, countries will need to track and report their progress on curbing emissions in a transparent, standardized way. And they\u2019ll need to offer much more detail on how they intend to cut fossil-fuel emissions in the future, so that outside"}

The well-known strong propensity of Indians to talk generously is continuing to grow apace, spurred by free VoLTE calling.\nThanks to the unfortunate spectrum experiences of 2008, it is now well known in India, even to the common man, that radio-frequency spectrum is a precious but finite resource that can be a powerful engine of socioeconomic growth and innovation in many spheres. Other nations have released large amounts of spectrum to their mobile operators but are continuously exploring ways and means of locating and releasing more spectrum for commercial use. Obviously, the rationale is that, with more and more new spectrum-based services coming into the market every day, one cannot ever have enough of this valuable resource for promoting economic good and public welfare.\nAgainst the above scenario, in India, however, we seem to be slipping into a dangerous state of complacency, with some stakeholders declaring publicly that they have enough spectrum and there is therefore little urgency for more spectrum allocations. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, such thinking is likely to only increase the digital divide between us and other comparable nations.\nDespite several e-auctions over the last eight years, spectrum allocation for commercial services in India continues to be very low when compared to other nations. For example, India has only 185 MHz of spectrum allocated to industry for mobile use, far behind the 369 MHz in the United States and 271 MHz in China. For a country with a large population and rapidly growing data usage (in fact, the highest in the world now!), this is indeed a very formidable constraint on the country\u2019s ability to offer new innovative solutions and next generation technologies.\nOperator-wise allocation is also amongst the lowest, so much so that the largest operator in India, Idea Vodafone Ltd., formed recently after the merger, has about 40% lower spectrum as compared to the global average of about 70 MHz. The above situation of inadequate allocation leads to extremely intense spectrum utilisation in India, with subscribers per MHz of spectrum being one of the highest in the world. One can well imagine the adverse impact on quality of service and all are aware of the state of our mobile call quality these days.\nMoreover, while data is growing explosively, it is not that voice is diminishing in India. The well-known strong propensity of Indians to talk generously is continuing to grow apace, spurred by free VoLTE calling. Thus, the spectrum demand due to this aspect has not reduced. This is only compounding the quality problem.\nMusey of Summit Bridge Capital points out that \u201cglobal mobile data traffic, and thus spectrum demand, is growing at an explosive rate (63% up in 2016 and by a similar amount in 2017). Video downloading represented 69% of consumer internet traffic in 2017 and, over 78% of the world\u2019s mobile data traffic will be video by 2021\u201d, leading to a humungous spectrum crunch for operators.

Carol Liu, D-Pasadena, is approved by the Legislature, it would be placed on the statewide ballot in 2014 and could be adopted by a simple majority vote. The Legislature can place constitutional amendments on the ballot without the governor\u2019s signature.\nThe two-thirds mandate is an offshoot of Prop. 13, the landmark 1978 measure that rolled back property taxes and capped yearly increases until a property is sold. In 1995, the two-thirds requirement was extended to include taxes for transportation projects listed on the ballot.\nJon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said he thinks a ballot battle is possible, especially after Proposition 30 won last fall. That temporary measure increased the state sales tax rate for all taxpayers and the personal income tax rates for upper-income taxpayers.\nThe effort comes at a time when funding sources are drying up. Last year, the California Transportation Commission released a report saying it expects to get $242 billion in federal, state and local funds through 2020 \u2014 about 45 percent of what is needed, or a $296 billion shortfall.\nStimulus funds have been spent to repave hundreds of miles of streets and freeways in the Bay Area, and a $20 billion bond measure approved by voters seven years ago to widen highways has also been spent.\nIn addition, the state gas tax has not been raised in nearly 20 years, and the increased popularity of electric vehicles and hybrid cars, along with higher federal fuel efficiency requirements, mean gas tax revenues are declining.\nSeveral Bay Area counties have managed to pass transportation sales taxes despite the two-thirds mandate, and BART and AC Transit have enacted parcel taxes to support their systems.\nIn 2008, Santa Clara County voters approved by a razor-thin margin a one-eighth-cent sales tax increase to pay to operate the BART extension into the county. Without that tax, the Federal Transit Administration would not have allocated $900 million in federal funds for the extension, and work would not have begun.\nLast fall, an Alameda County measure to raise sales tax by a penny failed by about 700 votes, killing funds for widening northbound I-680 through Fremont, replacing the I-580-I-680 interchange and upgrading BART.\nAlameda County Supervisor Scott Haggerty said the narrow defeat provides a strong argument for changing the passage threshold to 55 percent.\nMaking matters more pressing, said Heminger, was the passage of Prop. 26 in 2010, as it applied the two-thirds requirement to virtually all forms of transportation revenue that might be pursued at the local level \u2014 such as vehicle registration fees.\n\u201cThis hurdle only exacerbates the funding shortfalls,\u201d Heminger said.\nStaff writer Denis Cuff contributed to this report.

Those circumstances included: Obama's being in China for his first official visit; his knowing (as he must have, from his briefings) that the big Chinese bugaboo is \"outside interference\" from foreigners telling them what to do; and his knowing that he had business on many fronts ahead of him in Beijing. Even in those circumstances he clearly said: America believes that openness and liberties are not quaint American practices but are in fact universal and should be available to everyone, including in China. In domestic American politics, Obama has been known for doing his work with the scalpel rather than the sledgehammer. How much less deft would we like him to be on a foreign visit?\n\"I am a big believer in technology and I'm a big believer in openness when it comes to the flow of information. I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable. They can begin to think for themselves. That generates new ideas. It encourages creativity.\n\"And so I've always been a strong supporter of open Internet use. I'm a big supporter of non-censorship. This is part of the tradition of the United States that I discussed before, and I recognize that different countries have different traditions. I can tell you that in the United States, the fact that we have free Internet -- or unrestricted Internet access is a source of strength, and I think should be encouraged.\"\n\"I'm a big supporter of non-censorship\" is ungainly. But what's wrong with the statement as a whole?\nForeign leaders do not typically go to other countries and frontally criticize the way those places they're run -- at least not if they're smart, or serious. For instance, when Hugo Chavez made his famous \"I smell the devil!\" crack after following G.W. Bush to the podium at the U.N., this was not a sign of his wanting to do business with America. Yes, you got Chavez's point, in all its gross clownishness. Who could miss Obama's point in Shanghai? Would we welcome a French or German prime minister coming to a US town meeting in the Bush years, shortly before a negotiating session at the White House, and saying, \"Of course we condemn waterboarding, Guantanamo, and Abu Ghraib\"?

{"idx": "1563", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The U.S. House narrowly rejected on Thursday an amendment that would have barred transgender service members from being eligible for transition-related health care, including gender reassignment surgery.\nThe measure, which would have barred the Defense Department from expending funds on transition-related care, was introduced by Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) as part of the fiscal year 2018 defense authorization bill, but rejected on a 214-209 vote.\nAfter Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who presided over the vote, called out the tally, Democrats in the House chamber applauded in victory. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who\u2019s gay and a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, could be seen raising both hands in the air in a double-fist bump in celebration.\nAll 190 Democrats present voted against the proposal. They were joined by 24 Republicans, including Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who has a transgender son, as well as Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Mike Coffman (R-Colo.).\nThe vote on the amendment takes place after a short, but intense, period of debate on the House floor in which Hartzler and her GOP allies defended the measure and Democratic opponents criticized it as discriminatory.\nHartzler maintained the amendment was intended to focus the attention of the U.S. military on confronting the nation\u2019s adversaries \u2014 such as North Korea, Russia and the Islamic State \u2014 instead of other tasks.\nTransgender service members began serving openly in the U.S. military last year after then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lifted the ban on open service. The target date for allowing openly transgender people to enlist in the armed forces was July 1, 2017, although Defense Secretary James Mattis pushed back that date until January 1, 2018.\nAs evidence of \u201cmany problems with this policy,\u201d Hartzler cited the cost of transition-related care as well as transgender service members being unable to deploy as they recover from transition. The Missouri Republicans said care would cost $1.35 billion over the course of 10 years \u2014 a figure wildly higher than estimates from military experts.\nHartzler also cited a \u201clack of medical consensus\u201d on transition-related care, even though that treatment is supported by major medical organizations such as the American Medical Association.\nThe amendment, Hartzler said, does \u201cnot preclude service by transgenders\u201d and permits them to have health care other those related to gender transition, even though transgender service members across the board will likely need access to some form of transition-related care to remain in the armed forces.\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), a Marine veteran who served in the Iraq war, likely offered the most visceral defense of the Hartzler amendment on the House floor.\nNotably, Hartler was often left to herself when defending her amendment, while Democrats brought several members to the floor who were more prominent, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).\nPelosi said the amendment was a thinly-veiled attempt to ban transgender service members from the armed forces by seeking to deny them medically necessary care.\nPrior to the vote, the anti-LGBT Heritage Foundation sent out an email blast urging lawmakers to"}
{"idx": "1564", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Why Is The U.N. In The War-Making Business?\nThe strangest aspect of the United Nations' \"no-fly zone\" war over Libya is the involvement of the United Nations itself. While Congress' approval was all but an afterthought, the Obama administration devoted intense diplomatic energy to winning the approval of the United Nation's Security Council. No one asked: Why the U.N. is in the business of approving military actions at all?\nThe United Nations, created to end wars, now prolongs and enlarges them. It is time to take a hard look at the U.N.'s war-ending, peace-making record. After all, the promotion of peace is supposed to be its main duty.\nIn the wake of World War II, political leaders looked out on a devastated world. They saw in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and the Americas new graveyards spring up filled with millions of young men. In the richest parts of Europe and Asia there were bombed and burnt cities. Fearing that another global war would spell the end of civilization, they built a global institution that was supposed to stop small wars from getting big and end big wars altogether.\nThe U.N. bureaucracy lost its way. The U.N. has sanctioned two wars against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and now has approved the aerial bombardment of Libya.\nWhatever the merits of these wars, they are wars. And the U.N. approved them, as opposed to stopping them. It has morphed from a war-ending mission to a war-sanctioning vote. Of course there already are legislative bodies to declare wars: the U.S. Congress and the parliaments of various nations.\nDuplication aside, there are good reasons that the U.N. should not be in the war-approving business.\nDeclaring war is an intimate act between a people and government, a solemn decision that weighs the lives and fortunes of its citizens against the state's interest in securing the safety and trade of its citizens. In any democracy, this balancing act produces a lively debate. Most U.N. representatives represent nothing more than the ruling cliques, which are unelected or elected dishonestly. The people who are going to pay for or fight in these U.N. approved wars have no way to hold U.N. representatives accountable and too many of the war-making discussions at the U.N. are held in secret.\nMore insidiously, the U.N. fuels and funds the small conflicts it is supposed to end. Its scandalous administration of the \"oil for food\" program extended a lifeline to Saddam Hussein, perpetuating his power and the dangerous instability he represented, while corrupting scores of officials at the U.N. and in governments around the world.\nOr consider the case of the world's longest-running and most pointless war between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, a ragtag group of rebels residing in an Algerian slice of the Sahara. The war has raged, on and off, since 1975--with the U.N.'s acquiescence.\nThe U.N. created a body called MINURSO that has utterly failed to end conflict or resettle the some 200,000 refugees now eking out a spare existence in a scattering of mud-brick hovels without running water or continuous electricity. I visited the rebels' refugee camps in 2010 near Tindouf, Algeria. The people call themselves"}

The old idea that the world and all its living tenants were suddenly created is is giving way to the conviction that men of every age are a part of a vast, orderly development of which none know the beginning or the end.\nProfessor Shaler holds that the facts established by evolution point clearly and surely to the conclusion that there is an intelligent principle in control of the Universe. \"To those,\" he says, \"who have devoted themselves to natural inquiry, at the same time keeping their minds open to the large impression which that field affords, there generally comes a conviction as to the essential rationality of the operation. They have to consider facts which cannot be otherwise that a mighty kinsman of man is at work behind it all. Again and again the naturlist feels that this or that feature of the order exactly satisfies him, just as he feels that the turn of a phrase or the shape of a thought in an author is after his own mind. In fact, to the inquirer this recognition of himself, of his own intellectual quality in the events he is considering, gives the sense of the highest pleasure which his occupation affords.\"\nIt may be true, Professor Shaler acknowledges, that this intellectual quality akin to their own which men believe they see through the harmony of natural laws is but an imagination and an unreal theory. Personally, Professor Shaler believes it is not unreal, but is a scientific fact. By a series of illustrations he strives to prove that the fundamental processes of nature are so closly akin to the workings of the minds of men that we cannot escape the belief that some infinite and unmortal intelligence is back of all natural phenomena.\nProfessor Shaler agrees with Professor James in rejecting the old belief that consciousness is but a function of the brain and that, therefore, without a material brain consciousness is impossible. He also believes in the newer thought that the mechanism of the brain does not directly produce conciousness, but is the instrument through which an infinite consciousness influences men's personalities and finds expression in their lives."}

For instance, tomatoes are kept in a climate-controlled area, in the dark.\n\"They're really good at getting the most out of what they get,\" said Stone of the cruise line. \"It's our job to craft something that's not only delicious but really executable as well.\"\nChristian Dortch, whom Stone pulled from the line at Maude, is overseeing the culinary operations at both Share locations as the corporate chef.\nThe restaurants will offer a menu that includes a choice of appetizer, main course, sides and dessert.

I could go on and on, but my point here is that continued innovation -- in forms both large and small -- has improved the lives of our Soldiers and contributed immeasurably to their success on the battlefield, and will be critical to modernizing the force. Not only that, but those innovations have also created countless jobs and helped create untold wealth.\nRecently, I have endeavored to reach out to traditionally non-defense small businesses that have never worked with the government but have great ideas and perhaps revolutionary innovations that could be of some benefit to the Army. In order to maximize the Army's reach to industry, in 2014, while working in private industry, I created the Innovator's Corner, a popular engagement opportunity at the Association of the United States Army's Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, and more recently at AUSA's Global Force Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama. At this month's AUSA Annual Meeting, the Innovator's Corner will once again showcase individuals and small companies with unique products or services that can meet the needs of the Soldier.\nI have long recognized that the Army must enhance engagements with the entrepreneur-funded community, small businesses and other nontraditional defense partners by: 1) understanding the spectrum of technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Army; 2) integrating nontraditional innovators into the Army's research and development ecosystem; and 3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature and transition technologies of interest to the Army.\n\u2022 Provide seed capital to accelerate technology maturation.\n\u2022 Provide access to collaborative research space at Army Open Campus locations across the country.\n\u2022 Facilitate partnership opportunities with Army laboratories and test centers.\n\u2022 Provide mentorship to transition technologies back to the government.\nThese innovative activities coalesce the collective expertise of entrepreneurs, technologists and warfighters, all with a vision for making an impact on the defense of our nation.\nThe first instantiation of this new concept is the Expeditionary Technology Search, or xTechSearch, launched in June as a catalyst for the Army to engage with this promising business sector, driving American innovation for Army challenges and spurring economic growth. Aimed at attracting game-changing innovation, xTechSearch expands our sources beyond the traditional defense industrial base and provides access for pitching novel technology solutions directly to Army leadership.\nHaving come from industry and understanding the challenges associated with entering \"the process,\" I know firsthand that the Army must proactively and aggressively engage with innovators to see what new ideas, concepts, systems and subsystem components they can bring to the table.

Despite that, our research shows that only 2% of employees share content their company has shared on LinkedIn. Yet they drive tremendous value. They\u2019re responsible for about 20% of the overall engagement \u2013 clicks, likes, comments, and shares \u2013 that content receives. That\u2019s not surprising given employees have 10 times more connections than their company has followers, and people tend to be considered more authentic than companies.\nElevate can be accessed though desktop, as well as apps on iOS and Android. It allows employees to schedule content posting when their networks are most active. Elevate combines algorithmic recommendations from LinkedIn Pulse and Newsle, as well as human curation, to suggest content employees could share.\nThis product helps our employees start social conversations about Adobe and the industries we serve. Adobe employees who participated in the LinkedIn Elevate pilot drove 80 percent more Adobe job views than they did previously and in February alone, each participant drove three to four new trial downloads for Adobe solutions. Our employees want to be active on social media, and LinkedIn Elevate offers an easy platform to provide them with insightful content that they will want to share.\nReaders: What do you think of companies prompting employees to post content?"}

{"idx": "1587", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Valerie Goranson has twice lost her teaching assignment in Waukegan because she doesn't speak Spanish.\nAfter six years teaching 5th grade at North Elementary School, district officials moved Goranson to Clark Elementary School last year to make room for a Spanish-speaking teacher who could instruct the school's growing number of Spanish-speaking pupils, Goranson said. Now she's being involuntarily transferred again.\nIt's the kind of deja-vu that has Goranson, and many other monolingual teachers in Waukegan School District 60, worried about their prospects for continuing to teach in a city with one of the fastest-growing Latino populations. If immigrants continue to enroll in Waukegan schools at the rate they are now, these teachers wonder how long it will be before there are few positions available for teachers who don't speak Spanish.\n\"I know what the trend is, and it's not looking good,\" Goranson said. \"Even if my job was saved this year, what about next year?\"\nDistrict officials say the reassignments are the result of a districtwide restructuring plan, and not simply because of an increase in Spanish-speaking pupils. Moreover, while more elementary classes require bilingual teachers, that is not necessarily true overall because pupils transition to English, they say.\nStill, officials acknowledge Waukegan's changing demographics. \"I can understand why they are a little nervous,\" said Mary Lamping, the district's chief academic officer. \"If we don't have an English-speaking population to serve, then we're not going to need English-speaking teachers.\"\nWaukegan appears to be the first district in the Chicago area to trigger alarms among its monolingual teachers. Chicago Public Schools' immigrant population has remained constant for the last half decade, officials said. Despite growing numbers of Latino immigrants in suburban districts in Aurora, Elgin and Joliet, teachers union representatives there said they haven't received calls from monolingual teachers worried about their positions.\nBut Waukegan's teachers predict it won't be long before they do. Waukegan has seen a 25 percent increase in its Latino population since 2000, said Rob Paral, a demographer at the Institute for Metropolitan Affairs at Roosevelt University. Other suburbs are not far behind.\n\"Other communities will face this problem,\" said Linda Asma, a 5th-grade teacher at Oakdale Elementary School who said she expects one monolingual teacher at her school to be reassigned for the fall. \"I'd give it less than 10 years.\"\nDistrict officials say the restructuring enabled bilingual and special education classes in all 14 elementary schools, allowing pupils to attend in their neighborhood. So far, the district has been able to find slots for all teachers who have been moved involuntarily, officials say, adding that the number of English-only classrooms also has increased to accommodate a growing student population.\nThe number of bilingual classrooms has jumped -- from 124 in 2003 to 153 in 2006. The total number of classrooms has increased from 296 to 335, with 29 of the new ones being bilingual.\n\"We still have a lot of monolingual teachers,\" Lamping said.\nDistrict officials point out that Waukegan is following a 1973 state law that requires a school to provide a bilingual teacher if there are 20 or more students who speak the"}

But is it safe?\nA 3-inch hole in a rock wall at Mile 109 of the Seward Highway quenches many thirsts.\nTourists pull over for a cup of refreshing liquid Alaska, wild and cold. Locals, suspicious of treated city water, make the drive regularly to resupply their homes, even though there's less known about this source of water than the water from their sinks. Others simply prefer the taste of the water that trickles there, supplemental hydration they take away one Nalgene bottle at a time.\nThis drainage hole in the rock between Beluga Point and Windy Corner on Turnagain Arm draws visitors all day long. Anyone who has driven the highway with any regularity has seen them, perhaps wondered why, and maybe had to brake for them as they dart across the road.\nOne March afternoon, Ian Choi popped his trunk to grab a sleeve of Styrofoam cups for his passengers. Choi gives tours in Alaska, often to Korean visitors. People in Anchorage love this water, he told them. Three women climbed out of his car and crossed the highway and took a sip.\n\"Need a cup?\" Choi offered to a stranger who also had pulled over.\nMica Sexton pulled up next. He said he has lived in 14 communities in Alaska since he first came here in 1997. Before that, he had been living out of a backpack and traveling the world.\nSexton filled six large jugs for himself and his 180-pound Irish wolfhound to consume back home. Together, they go through about a gallon a day, he said. People are too trusting of the government and media, he said. Fluoride is one reason, he said, that he \"won't touch\" tap water.\n\"I think most people, when you tell them that somebody that they trust to look out for their good is putting something bad in their water, most people just look at you and tell you you need a tinfoil hat,\" Sexton said.\nSexton said he also suspects city water treatment removes healthy minerals he believes he's getting from this large drinking straw poked into the Chugach Mountains.\n\"Last time I drank tap water was, I don't know, eight years ago, so I don't know what the tap water tastes like,\" he said. \"But from what I'm told, this tastes a lot better.\"\nMaurice Mitchell was next in line. Like Sexton, he carries a length of pipe in his vehicle to insert in the rock, just in case the makeshift tap turns up missing. It often does, they said. The pipe has been removed and replaced many times over the years.\nMitchell lined jugs in the bed of his pickup neatly as classic rock spilled from the cab. He collected about 50 gallons, a 10-day supply for his three-person household in Anchorage. He parked on the mountain side of the road, angled on the embankment just feet from the traffic lane in a 55-mph zone. It seemed safer than crossing the road several times, he said.\n\"We use this for everything. For plants, household water, cooking, everything,\" he said.\nMitchell believes the water is cleaner and healthier than what comes out of the tap.\n\"I haven't had it tested myself, but I've talked to a few people"}

He and Mr. Obama both attended Columbia, though they were in different classes. They became friendly at Harvard Law School, where they both served in top positions at the Harvard Law Review . They have also been basketball buddies.\nDuring the campaign Mr. Genachowski shaped many of Mr. Obama\u2019s telecommunications and technology policies. He advocated an open Internet in the debate over so-called net neutrality, and media ownership rules that promoted a diversity of voices on the airwaves.\nWhile it is difficult to predict what direction Mr. Genachowski will take the commission, an analysis by Stifel Nicolaus, an investment firm, said that it expected that \u201cthe regulatory initiative is likely to shift\u201d away from some from incumbent \u2014 like the large telephone companies \u2014 to new entrants and other \u201cnontraditional telecom and media players\u201d including such companies as Google, Yahoo and eBay.\nIt speculated that Mr. Genachowski would seek to spur competition among the wireless carriers as a counterbalance to the dominance of the telephone and cable companies. And it said that Mr. Genachowski is unlikely to be as aggressive in his approach to regulating the cable industry as the current chairman, Kevin J. Martin, has been.\nMr. Martin has not set a departure date, although he is widely expected to step down soon. If he leaves before Mr. Genachowski\u2019s confirmation, then Mr. Obama is expected to name one of the two remaining Democratic commissioners \u2014 Michael J. Copps or Jonathan S. Adelstein \u2014 as interim chairman.\nPeople involved in the transition told The Times that Mr. Genachowski was a top candidate for both F.C.C. chairman and a new White House position overseeing technology issues that has not yet been fully defined.\nOver the last decade, the chairman of the F.C.C. has played a more expansive role in regulating the economy, particularly with the rise of the Internet and wireless communications. Now, as the new administration plans to make the expansion of broadband and Internet services a significant part of its stimulus package, Mr. Genachowski, with his close ties to Mr. Obama, could have a larger role in shaping economic policy than many of his predecessors.\nMr. Genachowski, the son of Eastern European Jews who fled during the Holocaust, is married to the documentary filmmaker Rachel Goslins, whose latest film, \u201cBama Girl,\u201d documents the 2005 homecoming queen contest at the University of Alabama.\nUpon graduating from law school, he clerked for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals. Mr. Obama had turned down a clerkship with Judge Mikva. Mr. Genachowski later clerked for Supreme Court Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and David H. Souter.\nHe was chief counsel to Reed Hundt, an F.C.C. chairman during the Clinton administration. He then worked for eight years as a senior executive at the IAC/Interactive Corporation, run by Barry Diller. He also founded an investment and advisory firm for digital media companies and co-founded the country\u2019s first commercial \u201cgreen\u201d bank."}

Polls have indicated voters are concerned that pensions will eat into revenue used for other government services, however, there has not been a major test at the polls on both establishing a remodeled pension program for new hires and also making changes in the pension system for current workers.\nThe San Diego proposal does both.\nIf the initiative passes, new city workers will be moved into a 401 (k) type plan and a freeze on pensionable pay for current workers will be put in place for five years.\nA few days ago, I argued that with state pension initiatives sidelined, union efforts were underway to knock off some local pension challenges.\nTrying to remove from the ballot a pension reform championed by Mayor Jerry Sanders, city councilman Carl DeMaio and others, local public employee unions, supported by the Public Employee Retirement Board, asked a judge to postpone the vote while the Retirement Board looked into charges of unfair labor practices.\nLast week, San Diego Superior Court Judge William Dato turned away the challenge. However, he said the labor unions could come back to court to invalidate the measure if it should pass.\nUnlikely a court would reverse the will of the voters in such a case.\nIf both sides go through the rigor of a campaign and the people decide that San Diego has to change its pension system, is a judge really going to throw out the people\u2019s will? The argument is over a vague notion that the mayor refused to negotiate over pension policy while at the same time pursuing a ballot measure as a private citizen.\nI doubt the courts would step in if the measure passes. Remember humorist Finley Peter Dunne\u2019s much repeated phrase: \u201cThe Supreme Court follows the election returns.\u201d Other courts, as well.\nCertainly there are instances when courts have overturned the voters\u2019 decision, especially when constitutional questions arise. We are in the middle of what could turn out to be such an instance with the legal fight over Prop 8.\nHowever, the San Diego legal challenge seems to be no more than a political move. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to use the courts as a political tool when it comes to ballot measures.\nThe San Diego pension measure election results would be an important marker on how the electorate feels about pension reforms. Given Judge Dato\u2019s ruling to keep the measure on the ballot, we are about to find out what the voters think."}

So far, it has required him to have two cortisone shots, while keeping him out of spring training games since March 1.\nWhat it will mean for him this season, the Yankees center field does not know. No one knows until he is able to swing a bat again. The 29-year-old signed by the Yankees to a seven-year, $70 million extension last month said he is shooting to be back in the lineup by April 4, the first day he could come off the injured list.\nYankee GM Brian Cashman said he wasn\u2019t concerned, but until Hicks began baseball activities again, there would be no clarity.\nBut Hicks could not say with any confidence when it is realistic that he will return.\nHicks had his second cortisone shot \u201cto the left\u201d of the first shot he received. Apparently he had progressed from working on strengthening his core muscles to trying to swing before having the pain flare up again.\n\u201cAfter the first one I didn\u2019t feel any pain as well. I didn\u2019t feel any pain until I tried to swing,\u201d Hicks said.\nHicks said that after his second cortisone shot in six days, his back felt good. He did 20 minutes riding the stationary bike and said he continues to work on his core.\nAaron Hicks' injury leaves a hole in the Yankees' outfield.\n\u201cRight now I feel great. No pain right now. Walking around and doing all my core stuff. Riding on the bike has been great. 20 minutes on the bike today and felt great. Feel like I am doing well,\u201d Hicks said.\nThe next step for Hicks is attempt the swinging motion to see if his back can withstand the torque and twisting motion.\n\u201cToday it feels really good. The true test will be obviously getting into the cage and doing swings is kind of where we really get to see how it feels,\u201d Hicks said.\nThe Yankees will shuffle their final roster to fill in at center field. Veteran Brett Gardner will likely start the season in center, Giancarlo Stanton will play left field and Tyler Wade will be the fourth outfielder who could possibly start in center. Since Hicks was the Yankees\u2019 best threat from the left side of the plate, they will likely have to carry both first baseman Luke Voit and Greg Bird, a lefty hitter with the threat of power.\nThat should get the Yankees through at least a week or two of Hicks being on the injured list.\nThis was the gamble the Yankees knew they were taking when they agreed to the seven-year extension with Hicks. The switch hitter is a critical piece in their heavily right-handed hitting lineup, but he also comes with a history of injuries.\nHicks has missed time with injuries to both hamstrings, an oblique injury and an intercostal injury in his time with the Yankees. Last season was the first that Hicks played in more than 125 games.\nBut the Yankees knew that history and weighed it against his progressive success.Last season Hicks hit .248/.366/.467 last season with 27 home runs and 79 RBI last season. He set career-highs in runs scored (90), hits (119), extra-base hits (48), R"}

The goal, then, was to impart training in industry-relevant skills for immediate employment to 2.4 million needy youth.\nDisregarding the number of those who were merely being reskilled for alignment of competencies to current practices, the nodal authority, the National Skill Development Council (NSDC), exceeded its target by completing coaching for 1.8 million people and certifying another 1.2 million people in the first year itself.\nIn 2016, a revamped version of the KVY was launched. This programme aimed at providing training to 10 million young people by 2020 and carried a budget of Rs 12,000 crore. However, data has shown that only 1.4 million people were trained by the NSDC under the reward programme, while 0.9 million people were certified and 0.1 million people were actually placed. That makes up just 8.5% of those who underwent the skilling programmes.\nThe Skill India mission is pledged to facilitate the entry of 104.62 million new employees into the industry by 2022. The NSDC exceeded its target of training 2.4 million youth in various short-term skill courses in the first year (2015) but fell short in the second year. A very low percentage of learners were actually placed. The reasons have been attributed to excessive targets and the short-term skills the programme laid emphasis upon.\nHence, to meet the targets of the Skill India mission and alleviate the gap between skills and labour supply, a more holistic approach encompassing longer-term skills and combinations with career-spanning competencies are needed.\nFurther, the government must include their project partners in policymaking so that the gap between ground reality and policy can be minimised and maximum benefit can be reaped against the resources (time, money, energy) invested.\nThe Niti Aayog has correctly pointed out that a more engaging way to measure skill development indicators is urgently required to accurately gauge where our society stands today.\nThe government hopes to build vast banks of employable workers rapidly and in a standard manner by strengthening institutions and infrastructure, exploring synergies between the government and industry and roping in overseas stakeholders and facilitators.\nThe same policies also envision re-skilling 400 million people by 2022. However, it has also been underlined by various surveys conducted among the youth for whom the programme was meant that certifications and skills do not match their aspirations or their aptitudes.\nTo resolve this dilemma, it has been suggested, that employability skills and attitudes be inculcated in schoolgoing children from a very early age. Our youth need to understand that professions require hard work, patience and one may be required to perform a lot of labour while striving to reach the career path one is best suited to. Varied experiences of different trades will only help shape their character and give them something to fall back should they fail in the venture closest to their hearts.\nChildren need to be made to understand that no value is created from scratch and that hard work is reward"}

The parish expects to send two buses down each major bayou road to pick up residents without transportation in vulnerable communities.\nThe Houma-Terrebonne Civic Center has been approved by the state as the central meeting point for people who need to be bused out of the parish, Deroche said.\nAll residents south of the Intracoastal should evacuate for any storm because erosion has increased the risk of flooding. For tropical storms and Category 1 and 2 hurricanes, the parish will open shelters in eight area schools.\nHowever, the state has mandated that there will be no shelters open in Terrebonne for a Category 3, 4 or 5 storm because it is too dangerous, Deroche said.\nSome locals question the wisdom of this policy. Parish Sheriff Jerry Larpenter said he believes that a shelter will have to be opened if disaster does strike, either because of an inability to evacuate everyone or to shelter the stubborn few who stay behind.\n\"We know that we can\ufffdt bus all the people out of Terrebonne, Lafourche and New Orleans,\" Larpenter said. \"People tend to wait till the last minute. It won\ufffdt be a hard decision to put up shelters in times of need.\"\nLarpenter said deputies would stay and assist even in the case of a Category 5 hurricane, using the downtown courthouse as its base of operations.\n\"Even if we do get 10 feet of water in Houma, the courthouse is five stories tall,\" Larpenter said. \"We\ufffdll be here.\"\nThe parish is currently compiling the results of an April survey to determine exactly how many people are unable to evacuate on their own. FEMA previously reported the number of residents without transportation in Terrebonne to be between 5,000 and 6,000 people, but Deroche said he believes there could be more.\nPeople in need of transportation should contact the Office of Emergency Preparedness at 873-6357.\nTerrebonne has about 120 buses available to evacuate residents, Deroche said. He said that may not be enough to evacuate all residents of Terrebonne Parish who may need assistance.\nIf a greater need arises, Deroche said the state has promised to provide buses from nearby states, though he doesn\ufffdt know how many or where they\ufffdll come from.\nThe sheriff was visibly skeptical of this state promise, saying he didn\ufffdt know how officials could get enough buses to the parish in the short window of time before a hurricane landfall.\n\"It all sounds good, and I hope it works, but realistically, they don\ufffdt know exactly where a storm will hit three days out,\" L"}

All three clubs denied wrongdoing.\nFormer Cameroon international Jean-Claude Mbvoumin, who has set up the Culture Foot Solidaire group to fight the trafficking of minors, says that young African players are still brought to Europe by false agents.\nHe told Reuters last year that families sometimes hand over their life savings to the agents hoping to secure a move to a top club, only for their sons to be abandoned on the streets of Europe.\nFIFA is also facing a legal complaint at the European Commission from the world players\u2019 union FIFPro, which says that the current transfer regulations have led to a lack of competition in the sport."}

The resolution cites the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which provide authoritative guidance concerning use of force by security officers. However, the Argentine resolution contains loopholes and ambiguities that could allow security officers to employ firearms in an unacceptably broad set of circumstances.\nThe resolution establishes that federal security forces have an obligation to respect human dignity and human rights, and that they will only be able to use firearms when such use is strictly necessary and proportionate to \u201cfulfil their duties.\u201d It adds that security forces \u201cwill use\u201d firearms in self-defense, or to protect someone else from an imminent risk to life or serious injury, to prevent a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting authority, or to prevent their escape.\nHowever, the new provisions are inconsistent with human rights standards that strictly limit the use of firearms.\nMoreover, the provisions allow federal security officials to use firearms when \u201cnon-violent means are ineffective,\u201d without specifying that there are other means to use force that should be employed before using firearms.\nUnder the UN Basic Principles, security officers should only employ firearms when \u201cless extreme means,\u201d including violent ones, are insufficient. This is a key provision because it recognizes that firearms are more likely to cause death or injury than other uses of force. For that reason, security forces should use firearms not just where non-violent means are ineffective, but where other, less lethal modes of force are also impracticable. The resolution fails to maintain that principle, and for that reason seems to countenance shootings in a wide variety of unjustifiable scenarios."}

The administration is giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program.\nWester called for New Mexicans to urge their elected leaders to pass a bipartisan DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cI am deeply troubled by the president\u2019s decision today to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects more than 800,000 young immigrants from deportation,\u201d Wester said in his statement. \u201cIn my judgment, DACA has stood as a counterpoint to the voices of exclusion and now, without the action of Congress, this crucial support for these young immigrants has been taken away."}

The company can create waterproof, tear resistant field maps, poster maps and custom-sized mega maps.\nHarshyne got the idea for the company after he made a hunting map for his father for Father\u2019s Day four years ago. He didn\u2019t want to create a map with only an aerial photo because it only showed tree cover, and terrain was important to understand the best places to deer hunt. Harshyne upgraded it by blending in terrain by simulating shadows created from the sun. He also digitized the trails, and highlighted the family\u2019s different tree stands.\nHis father was impressed by the product and the map proved useful in the following hunting season.\nOn a hunting trip to Illinois, Harshyne and his father showed the map to the owner of an outfitting company. He was similarly impressed since he typically printed his maps off on Google. The outfitter, Aaron Milliken, went on to work for a real estate company called Whitetail Properties that sells hunting properties.\nHarshyne first thought he had an opportunity to build the business that became HUNTERRA once Whitetail Properties asked him to build maps to show off the property listings. Harshyne stood up HUNTERRA in 2011, but he was still working on the maps part time while he maintained his full time post at NCTC.\nThe company continued to grow as Harshyne designed a website where hunters could visit and order maps specific to their upcoming hunts. The work load grew and eventually Kate Harshyne quit her job in the culinary industry to work on HUNTERRA full time.\nThe Harshynes went all in this summer when Ben quit his job and the couple sold their northern Virginia home to move to the Midwest and be closer to the hunting grounds that they most often map. In fact, the couple refurbished a 1979 Airstream Excella trailer and is driving across the U.S. to promote HUNTERRA.\nThe company currently offers three types of maps: the field map, the poster map and the mega map. The field map is a tear resistant, waterproof map that hunters or hikers can fold up and store in their pocket. The map is 10 x 15 inches and is meant to accompany you in the field, and can be marked up with dry erase Crayons or permanent Sharpies.\nThe poster map comes in three sizes -- 20 x 30 inches, 30 x 45 inches and 40 x 60 inches. A light adhesive on the back makes it easy to hang on the wall or stick to a table.\nThe mega map allows hunters and bikers to pick any size. Harshyne said he uses a mosaic of multiple sheets to build huge displays for large properties and ranches without losing the detail that his customers require.\nHUNTERRA has already received national exposure through its work with Whitetail Properties. The company has a hunting show on the Sportsman Channel in which some of HUNTERRA\u2019s maps have been featured. Harshy"}

Exxon-Mobil would control only about 13 percent of the American market. Besides, it is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, not private oil companies, that controls 40 percent of the world oil market and sets price and output targets. As a group, the private companies help keep OPEC in line, but none controls much of anything.\nMr. Adelman no doubt exaggerates. But the commission would be hard pressed to persuade a court to block the merger. For starters, bigness is irrelevant to the antitrust law. Only competition matters. And while companies have grown bigger over the decades, markets have not grown significantly less competitive. In effect, there are more big companies competing against one another.\nF. Michael Scherer of Harvard University provides unpublished estimates of the trends in concentration. In 1947, he calculates, around 25 percent of the nation's manufacturing output came from highly concentrated industries. By 1992, the number had risen to only about 28 percent. Measured differently, the four largest manufacturing companies in an industry typically controlled about 35 percent of sales in 1947. By 1972, the percentage had risen to 39 percent and did not budge through 1992.\nIn the case of oil, there is also evidence that bigness helps consumers. Matthew Simmons, an energy investment banker, says that data from company reports show that the largest oil companies spend less on exploration and production for every barrel of oil than do smaller companies. Philip Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., argues that mergers, by cutting exploration and production costs, will ultimately lead to lower prices for consumers. He also argues oil companies have to become huge, undertaking many projects, in order to spread the risk of putting up the vast sums of money that are now required to explore for oil reserves. Laying pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Turkey, or drilling more than a thousand feet down in the Gulf of Mexico require investments measured in the billions.\nBut do the large companies achieve low production costs because they are large, or are these companies large because they knew how to find and drill oil cheaply? And there are also reasons to be skeptical about some of the industry's claims. Companies the size of Mobil that contend that they cannot find the money to make risky investments make little sense, Mr. Adelman says. Oil companies have been allowed to create joint ventures, free of antitrust challenge, to explore for oil in specific locations. They do not need to merge their entire operations.\nWith the Exxon-Mobil merger, there are uncontroversial antitrust issues that the commission will handle with relative ease. There are regions, like the Northeast, where a combination of the two companies would"}

But analysts said Khamenei's announcements served to reinforce the assumption of U.S. and European officials that Iran wants to be more integrated in the world.\nBased on that theory, E.U. foreign policy chief Javier Solana last month presented a package of incentives to Iran -- including promises of trade and technical advice -- as part of efforts to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment.\n\"As far as bringing Iran out of isolation and joining with international organizations, it's a positive step,\" said Davoud Hermidas Bavand, a professor of international law at Tehran's Supreme National Defense University, referring to Khamenei's announcement.\nThe formation of a new foreign relations panel may also indicate dissatisfaction with the foreign policy performance of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Khamenei named as the panel's chairman Kamal Kharrazi, the man Ahmadinejad removed as foreign minister after taking office last year.\n\"I think it's significant,\" said a European diplomat in Tehran, who asked to not be identified further so that he could speak openly. \"Personally, I think it amounts to trying to put limits to the president.\"\nThe new Strategic Council for Foreign Relations also includes another former foreign minister, a former admiral in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a former commerce official and a cleric with hard-line credentials who has served as Iran's ambassador to China. The new council joins a constellation of existing government panels devoted to foreign policy, but it will report directly to Khamenei, who \"sensed a deficiency,\" Kharrazi told Iranian media.\nBill Samii, who follows Iranian affairs for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, said Ahmadinejad's confrontational rhetoric reflects the views of fellow veterans of the eight-year war with Iraq, when Iran was bitterly disappointed to find itself fighting alone. Western powers and Arab states supported Saddam Hussein's secular Iraq.\n\"Ahmadinejad and his cohorts play up the sort of appeal to the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement on the nuclear issue, and of course their background and their experience in the war with Iraq teaches them you want to be as self-sufficient as possible,\" Samii said. \"But the leadership and people in responsibility know you can't go it alone. You can't walk the talk.\"\nHe said Khamenei wants to find a way for Iran to be part of international politics and the global economy without being seen as having given in to Western pressure. Iran has traditionally defined itself in contrast to the West, and Western powers now accuse it of secretly pursuing nuclear weapons.\n\"Iran has been isolated . . . and this is something they find very unpalatable,\" Samii said.\nIran's embrace of reforms that could win the nation acceptance in the international community has been halting.

He is also a close friend of the billionaire oligarch and Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov and indirectly a leading figure behind MegaFon, the Russian telecoms business that Usmanov jointly listed on the London and Moscow stock markets on Wednesday.\nSitting next to Skoch is Sergei Mikhailov and, next to him on the front row is Viktor Averin. These are said to be two of Russia's most feared gangsters.\nThese old connections have suddenly resurfaced as MegaFon \u2013 which last week announced the appointment to its board of former Labour minister and one time chairman of the Guardian Media Group Lord Myners \u2013 began trading 17% of its shares in London. Coincidentally, that is almost the same size of stake indirectly owned by the Skoch family. The shares fell nearly 3% on their first day.\nSkoch, who has placed all of his business interests in the name of his father, Vladimir, declined to answer any questions about his connections when approached by the Guardian in Moscow last week. In a response to questions by email, a spokesperson for Usmanov said there have been \"too many unwarranted allegations, rumours and speculations about different people in Russia\".\nHowever, Skoch was prepared to give an interview to last Friday's Financial Times in which he admitted knowing Mikhailov and Averin. He also previously spoke about the ties in a 2010 interview with the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, during which he confirmed that the photo was genuine.\nHe said that he got to know Mikhailov after he and Lev Kvetnoy bought several service companies at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.\nSkoch added that he was \"introduced\" to Mikhailov and Averin as the \"owners\" of the Vnukovo companies. \"We met, discussed terms, and then agreed \u2013 the photo was taken afterwards,\" he said.\nAverin subsequently invited him and his wife to a holiday in Prague, in 1995.

It appears some preferences may be ageless. Consider the e-book or e-reader. Whether a Kindle, Nook, Sony or another manufacturer, one might assume that these pieces of high-tech must be in high-demand by nearly everyone but especially among younger users. While Pew has reported e-book reader sales rising, new data from Rasmussen suggests that the printing press may have a few more years to go.\nAccording to Rasmussen three out of four Americans still prefer books over today\u2019s e-books. Approximately 75% enjoy paper, 15% enjoy digital format and another 10% are undecided. The number of paper users does not waiver much based upon book buying habits, 74% of those who bought a book in the last month prefer bound text to screen reading. Here is where it gets interesting. Despite the digital divide in other tech domains, the generations are remarkably aligned in their preference to read \u201ctraditional print format\u201d rather than on an \u201celectronic book reading device\u201d. Of survey respondents ages 18-39, 70% prefer hardcopy, as do 79% of middle-aged readers and 78% of consumers 65+. Clearly younger readers are more likely to use an e-reader, 19% compared to only 14% and 10% respectively for consumers 40-64 and those 65 years old and older, but nearly 75% of every age prefers paper.\nWhat accounts for this generational agreement? E-readers are pretty convenient and can lighten the load for those who find it hard to choose which of their summer reading list to take the beach. However, the heft of a book may be an attraction all of its own. Quite possibly readers of all ages enjoy the feel of the book and the act of turning the page. Other fans of paper may still enjoy the taboo act of scribbling on the page. Or, perhaps, sharing a good read feels like more of a gift when handing it off rather than sharing a download.Whatever the reason, these recent data may suggest something I have long suspected. It is not the age of the user but the user\u2019s experience and that predicts acceptance or adoption of a device.\nE-readers provide a unique case study. Most younger buyers never used vinyl, 8-tracks, cassettes, or as painful as it may be for anyone over 30 to hear, CDs, to listen to their music. Young music lovers come fresh and ready to embrace new media and devices because they have no mental model \u2013 experience and an understanding of how something should look and work \u2013 to reconcile or adjust in order to learn something new. Essentially, they have nothing to give up or relearn in order to adopt something new. Unlike many devices such as MP3 players, i-anything or a never-ending list of apps, younger and older users start out from the same place when considering e-book adoption.

For consumers enamored of touch-screen tablets, laptops suddenly seem like stale, clunky gadgets whose basic clamshell design hasn't changed all that much in two decades.\nIt opens. It shuts. Yawn.\nBut this week at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the laptop is attempting a comeback. The stodgy clamshell is being cast aside by manufacturers who are trying to create a new category of device that combines the feel and functions of tablets and laptops.\nCall them hybrids. Call them convertibles. These new computers fold. They twist. They slide. They detach.\nAnd, more importantly, they are spawning like crazy. This wild burst of experimentation is being driven by a number of trends that suddenly converged: thinner designs, better touch screens and the arrival in October of Windows 8, Microsoft Corp.'s new operating system designed for touch screens.\nBut there's another crucial element: desperation. Industry insiders say laptops have to change quickly or face a long, slow decline.\n\"The impetus was the tablet,\" said Nick Reynolds, Lenovo's executive director for worldwide consumer products. \"Unless the personal computer becomes interesting and personal again, it's going to die.\"\nThe explosion of these so-called multi-mode laptop computers is the latest indicator of just how dramatically the computing industry has been turned upside down since Apple Inc.'s introduction of the first iPad almost three years ago.\nSince then sales of tablets have consistently exceeded even the most optimistic projections. Companies that were once leaders in selling personal computers and laptops, or the components such as chips and processors that go inside, were caught flat-footed by the turbocharged pace of change.\nAccording to the Consumer Electronics Assn., which hosts CES, tablets and smartphones, two categories that barely existed a few years ago, will account for 40% of global sales of all consumer electronic devices in the coming year.\nSome companies have scrambled to build their own tablets, usually based on Google Inc.'s Android operating system, with some limited success. Last year, Microsoft unveiled its own tablet, Surface, based on the new Windows 8 platform.\nBut many other companies are trying to reinvent the laptop.\nGlimpses of some of these devices were seen at the last CES. But since the release of Windows 8 in October, a trickle has turned into a flood. By the end of 2013, chip maker Intel Corp., which is making big bets on these new devices, is estimating that there could be as many as 140 varieties of these multi-mode computers on the market.\nThese new forms offer consumers unprecedented choice. The risk is that they also create confusion.\nFor instance, a consumer might consider the Toshiba Satellite. Open the top and you have a laptop running Windows 8 with a touch screen. Open until both halves lie flat, then slide the screen over the keyboard to switch to a tablet.\nOr check out Lenovo's Yoga, which the company calls a \"flip and fold\" because its hinges allow you to open"}

The Christian minority in Israel, around 154500 people, is extremely active in civic and economic life while enjoying equal political rights and representation.\nIn his piece, the ambassador noted that half the Christian population in Gaza Strip has fled since the Hamas takeover of the territory. Hamas prohibits Christmas decorations and public displays of Christian symbols, he wrote.\nOren explained that while Christians once made up 15 percent of the West Bank's population, today that number is as low as 2 percent.\nThe uprisings against longtime Arab dictators have left Christian communities around the Middle East in a precarious and often violent situation. In Egypt, the Coptic Christian community, about 10 percent of Egypt\u2019s 81 million people, has come under repeated attacks by mobs since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. In Syria, the Christian community has been targeted as part of the government\u2019s continuous assault on protesters since demonstrations against President Bashar Assad began last March.\nOren also noted that Iraq has seen a wave of church destructions and in Iran, conversion to Christianity is punishable by death.\n\u201cThe extinction of the Middle East's Christian communities is an injustice of historic magnitude,\u201d Oren said.\nYet Israel has seen an explosion in its Christian population, a trend Oren said was due to the freedom and opportunity given to the minority community.\n\u201cThe only place in the Middle East where Christians aren't endangered but flourishing is Israel. Since Israel's founding in 1948, its Christian communities (including Russian and Greek Orthodox, Catholics, Armenians and Protestants) have expanded more than 1,000 percent,\u201d he said.\nIsrael\u2019s protection of Christians could provide a useful model for its neighbors, said Oren.\n\u201cIsrael provides an example of how this trend can not only be prevented but reversed.

But it soon emerged that her husband may have four wives \u2014 although it was doubtful the marriages were made official under French law.\nThe situation appeared to be a boon to Sarkozy, who is trying to rush through controversial legislation forbidding burqa-style Islamic veils that cover the face, on the grounds that they don't respect French values or women's dignity. But it has stoked debate and may backfire on legal grounds.\nMany Muslims fear a law banning face-covering veils because they say targeting the tiny minority of women who cover their faces stigmatizes France's entire Muslim community \u2014 at an estimated 5 million people, the largest in western Europe.\nThose who want a full ban on the face-covering veil contend the garment conceals more than the face, notably helping to perpetuate practices like polygamy, approved in some Muslim countries, and is a signpost of a radical interpretation of Islam.\nInterior Minister Brice Hortefeux wants to revoke the French citizenship of the driver's husband if he is found to be practicing polygamy. The man is also suspected of profiting from state subsidies for single women provided to each of the wives.\nAuthorities are looking into whether the Algerian-born Lies Hebbadj was married to four women in French civil ceremonies, which would be highly unlikely. Were he married in religious ceremonies by imams in Algeria or in France, these unions would not count as marriages under French law, said Rabah Hached, a Paris lawyer who specializes in immigration issues. In that case, each of the officially unmarried women could potentially receive state aid for her children.\nFor the attorney, the law may be on the side of the allegedly polygamous man.\n\"It's not forbidden to have a mistress,\" Hached said by telephone. While stressing he does not know details of the case, Hached said that \"I strongly suspect this gentleman we're talking about is within his rights.\"\nHebbadj, defended his lifestyle Monday by turning the notion of polygamy on its head.\n\"If we are stripped of nationality, for having mistresses,\" Lies Hebbadj told reporters in Nantes, then \"there would be a lot of French people stripped of nationality. As far as I know, mistresses are not forbidden, neither in France, nor in Islam.\"\nHe did not specify whether he lives under the same roof with the various women in his life, although press reports have quoted neighbors as saying he moves between several houses. Hebbadj, whose robed image has been flashed around France by TV, runs a recently opened halal butcher shop.\nThe revelation last week that a police officer cited the woman, whose name has not been revealed, for driving while wearing a niqab, which reveals only the eyes, provided a taste of what is in store.\nA French bill that would outlaw the veils in all public places will be introduced in May,"}

Nothing tempts the gods so much as the arrogance of a timeless skyscraper.\nAnd yet, no one minds arrogance these days, and a bit of hubris never hurt anyone; even a lot of it--to quote Michael Douglas in his role as greedy arbitrageur--can be a good thing! The greed of big business and the arrogance of big builders have given us vistas and sky views that rival anything from Mount Olympus. Skyscrapers, after all, are about business the way Manhattan is about buildings.\nThe sense of danger and awe that any large structure automatically invokes to those of us who are superstitious but not afraid of heights may never have crossed the architect's mind.\nYou can criticize skyscrapers for their irreverent arrogance, but you can't accuse them of defying the odds. This, after all, is what skyscrapers are supposed to do; this is what they have in common with the man who threw a cable between both towers of the World Trade Center and then proceeded to walk on it. They defy the odds, look the odds in the face and stick their tongue out, as did another fearless soul, the New York Times photographer Ernie Sisto, when he asked two colleagues to hold him by the legs while he climbed out onto a ledge high on the Empire State Building and, aiming down, got the angle he wanted for his photograph of the huge hole left by a B-25 bomber that had crashed into the building.\nMention any book on skyscrapers and its pages will invariably round up the usual nouns: pride, power, glory, ambition, splendor, defiance. The vaulting arrogance of the Woolworth Building, the sleek opulence of the Flatiron Building, the guarded splendor of the Chrysler, the garish plenitude of the Ansonia. The adjectives trickle down with the two-bit eloquence of someone trying to avoid the obvious word: \"timeless.\"\nTimeless, however, is an irrelevant concept--and for totally modern reasons. We have grown wiser with the centuries and no longer build skyscrapers the way people used to build pyramids. We build for the long haul, but not for eternity.\nThe most cursory glance at Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl W. Condit's spectacular Rise of the New York Skyscraper, 1865-1913, tells the sad tale plainly enough: The Washington Life Building (demolished), Commercial Cable Building (demolished), Gillender Building (demolished), St. Paul Building (demolished)--and the list goes on. The long haul, it turns out, is not long enough. And here-to-stay is really here-today.\nGone-tomorrow! And this, in the end, is the untold tale that the builders of the Parthenon, of the Lighthouse, of the Circus Maximus or of Versailles would never have understood. We don't quite understand it ourselves: not that all things come down in the end, but that the end must come so soon.\nThere is after all something even more arrogant than building the Tower of Babel. It is building it and then, on second thought, tearing the whole thing down again. Our arrogance may be more circumspect that King Nimrod's, but it is also tackier. It lacks what our buildings try so hard to convey: grandeur.\n"}

Republican nominee Susan Hawk is trying to unseat two-term District Attorney Craig Watkins.\nWatkins was inaugurated in January of 2007. He was the first African-American in Texas elected to the position. He touts a 99.4 percent felony conviction rate and is most known for his partnership with the Innocence Project of Texas.\nDespite widespread recognition for the success of the Innocence Project, Hawk has encouraged voters to look beyond this one accomplishment.\nOn the other side, Hawk is a former felony prosecutor and has been a criminal court judge for the past two decades. Throughout her campaign, she has continually touted Watkins as inexperienced.\nNevertheless, Hawk continues to claim that Watkins has never walked into a courtroom and tried a case. She emphasizes the fact that she has tried more than 150 jury trials with a 98 percent conviction rate. Chair of the Dallas County Democratic Party Darlene Ewing said the District Attorneys job is not to be a trial lawyer. The D.A.\u2019s job is to be an administrator and work in a management position.\nHawk isn\u2019t the only candidate getting heated. Watkins called his opponent a \u201cdesperate politician.\u201d He is likely referring to the fact that Hawk has run for office as both a Republican and a Democrat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to convince Democrats to support her because she used to be a Democrat and she turned Republican and that sort of thing is not appealing to base voters in Dallas county,\u201d Jeffers said.\nThe candidates met face-to-face in two separate televised events. In their first TV matchup, Hawk criticized Watkins for his use of forfeiture funds. She was referring to an instance in 2013 when Watkins used money from this fund to settle a car accident he caused.\n\u201cThey [forfeiture funds] are there to be used for law enforcement purposes only, not Mr. Watkins\u2019 slush fund,\u201d Hawk said.\nHawk launched a web campaign called \u201c#firecraig.\u201d The web page is titled, \u201cThe Craig Watkins Record: Investigations, controversy and abuse of power\u201d and accuses Watkins of a variety of things from abusing public funds to renting a house to a drug dealer.\nHawk\u2019s campaign has raised significantly more money than Watkins. She has used the money to fund her web campaign as well as launch a bigger television media campaign and billboards purporting similar messages. Dallas County Democrats say this is nothing to be concerned about.\nThe candidates second televised meeting turned ugly when Hawk accused Watkins of drinking before a public forum on crimes against women and children. As they left the event Hawk muttered to Watkins, \u201chave another cocktail.\u201d She later apologized for this remark.\nThings seem to be settling down as the race enters it\u2019s final weekend. Jeffers says it will all come down to voter turnout. In order to win, Hawk has to find a way to get Republicans to vote the straight ticket while Watkins must make sure his base gets out to vote.\nOverall, Watkins is the chosen favorite in the race.

The kids grew up and turned to high-end trucks, while the Corolla at once has remained true to its frugal roots and at the same time has been polished up.\nReaching dealers throughout the nation now, the 2020 model offers a lower stance, firmer suspension, lighter steering and electronic goodies like Apple Play not found on the 2019 version.\nWhile its redesign is costly, Toyota avoided a price surge. Corolla prices range up to about $26,000, depending on trim level. Base price is $19,500.\nTwenty grand can sound decidedly above economy car sensibility, particularly around Blue Springs.\nToyota opened the plant in 2011 near this hamlet of 102 homes located in a cattle, timber and furniture manufacturing region 100 miles from Memphis.\nHere, an old cottage in good shape can be had for not much more than a fancy $50,000 pickup truck.

As an online-only player, it has dished out some pretty interesting offerings so far, the most recent being the Infinix Hot S3 (Review), which also won a coveted spot in our list of best phones under Rs. 10,000.\nThat particular segment is already pretty crowded, with Xiaomi pretty much dominating it. Infinix now has a new model called the Hot 6 Pro, which targets users who are looking for a large display to enjoy content on. It\u2019s priced pretty aggressively at Rs. 7,999, which pits it right against the Xiaomi Redmi 5 (Review). Big display aside, is the Hot 6 Pro a good all-rounder? We review to find out.\nInifinix sent us a Sandstone Black unit of the Hot 6, which looks really slick. The matte finish of the back offers a good grip, and doesn\u2019t attract fingerprints too much. It also contrasts well with the 2.5D curved-edge display. The Hot 6 Pro is available in Magic Gold and Bordeaux Red colour options as well.\nThe Infinix Hot 6 Pro feels fairly light at 158g, with good weight distribution across the entire body. The sides aren\u2019t very slim but that means there's more surface area to grip the phone. The highlight of the phone is of course the display, which measures 5.99 inches diagonally and has an HD+ resolution (720x1440). The display follows the 18:9 aspect ratio, so it's taller with slim borders on the left and right. The screen is bright with a claimed brightness of 500 nits, and colours are vivid and punchy. Text and the edges of icons aren\u2019t the sharpest since the pixel density is only around 268ppi. There\u2019s scratch resistant glass too, by NEG.\nThe power button on the Infinix Hot 6 Pro has a textured surface, making it easy to distinguish it from the volume rocker. There\u2019s a notification LED near the earpiece. On the bottom there's a 3.5mm headphones socket, a Micro-USB port, and a mono speaker. There\u2019s a SIM tray on the left which supports two Nano-SIM cards and a separate microSD card (of up to 128GB).\nThe back of the Infinix Hot 6 Pro is not removable, even though the design seems to suggest otherwise. There\u2019s a centre-mounted fingerprint sensor which is easy to reach, although authentication isn\u2019t very quick and it takes a full second (or a bit more) before the screen actually wakes up. Infinix offers dual cameras at the back, which is something we don\u2019t see too often in this segment. The cameras are horizontally aligned and sit nearly flush with the rest of the body.\nIn the box, you get the usual assortment of accessories such as a Micro-USB cable, power adapter, case, screen guard, and SIM eject tool, but no headset.\nThe guts of the Hot 6 Pro are based around the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 mobile platform, and herein lies one of the biggest issues with this phone.

More people are rightly worried as the changing climate leads to more unpredictable, extreme weather.\nHuman action has generated the greenhouse gases that have caused climate change.\nFor some, this has led to despair about humanity as a whole. \u201cPeople\u201d are destroying the planet, they say, and \u201cnature\u201d is now taking its revenge.\nYet climate change isn\u2019t an inevitable result of people acting on the environment. Nor is everyone equally responsible for it. Climate change flows from the logic of the system we live in\u2014and those who benefit from that system are the most culpable.\nOne startling report published last November laid this bare. Richard Heede\u2019s study estimated that just 90 firms produced nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide and methane emissions between 1751 and 2010.\nHe added that these estimates were \u201cgenerally conservative\u201d.\nSome 83 of the firms produced oil, gas or coal and the remaining seven were cement manufacturers. The biggest emitter was Chevron USA, followed by ExxonMobil USA. BP in Britain came fourth.\nMany of the most heavily polluting industries have been the most profitable ones\u2014and the ones central to modern capitalism.\nFossil fuel companies have fought to create a system heavily reliant on their products. At times they have done this more blatantly than at others.\nIn 1940 General Motors, with help from Standard Oil and the Firestone tyre company, took over an electric rail firm in the US. It set about systematically destroying the tracks so that people would be more reliant on cars.\nPowerful interests such as this shape the individual \u201cchoices\u201d that we are able to make and are typically blamed for. And because polluting firms have so much invested in their products, their immediate incentive is to keep polluting.\nSo, Heede\u2019s study reported that half the estimated emissions were produced in the last 25 years. That\u2019s well after the impact on the planet had become clear.\nThe people responsible for climate change are the same everywhere\u2014the rich and powerful, and those with vested interests in polluting industries. They are also responsible for allowing the problem to grow by refusing to take the action that could really tackle it.\nYet we are forever being told that it is down to individuals to make the right choices to cut down their \u201ccarbon footprints\u201d.\nPoliticians tell us that we must recycle more, use energy more efficiently and eat less meat. And many people are keen to do whatever they can to help. But the problem is that the changes individuals can make go nowhere near bringing about the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that we need.\nSo, government-run initiatives target consumers who they claim are wasting too much food. Yet it\u2019s the big supermarkets and food producers that create enormous waste\u2014both in what they throw away themselves and in what they sell just in time for it to go off.\nThe system doesn\u2019t leave most people the time, money or energy to get an environmentally friendly diet, even if one was available.\nPeople can try to cut down on car use, for example by trying to negotiate car shares to work. But to make a real difference would require the state to nationalise public transport in order to provide cheap, efficient travel.\nAnd it\u2019s unfair to tell people to save energy when landlords and housing policy have pushed them into badly-insulated homes that cost a \u00adfortune to heat.\nFocusing on individuals ignores the fact that waste and inefficiency are built into capitalism.\nProduction isn\u2019t planned in"}

Once you work through the shock, you do you what any parent would do: find the best possible care to get her through it. But where do you go?\nHealth care for children is different from care for adults. Treating kids requires doctors who are experienced with their unique needs, and according to Stanford pediatricians Paul Wise and Lisa Chamberlain, this experience is developed and lives in children\u2019s hospitals.\nAnd these facilities are highly dependent on Medicaid.\n\u201cChildren are the poorest segment of the United States population,\u201d said Wise, a Stanford Health Policy core faculty member.\nNearly one out of every five children lives below the poverty line, according to the United States Census Bureau. Very few children need extensive health care, but of those that do, about 44 percent rely on Medicaid or other public insurance programs.\nBecause so many of their patients use Medicaid, these children\u2019s hospitals need reimbursements from the program to support their services. Without this income, some might have to downsize or even shut down, and if they do, services would suffer for all children.\nIf the American Health Care Act (the Republican replacement for Obamacare) passes Congress, Medicaid will convert to a per capita cap system. Instead of providing coverage to all who meet its criteria \u2014 which is primarily based on income and need \u2014 the federal government would cap how much money the federal government could provide each person.\nWise and Chamberlain worry that a set amount allocated for states or individuals would not be able to keep up with health industry inflation, causing payments to effectively decrease over time. They are also concerned that children would be particularly affected by these changes because their medical needs are so different from adults\u2019.\nNot only would the funds available for child health coverage erode, but according to Wise, the focus on adult health concerns in the emerging Medicaid changes could, without immediate attention, undermine 40 years of progress in developing strong, regionalized child health systems.\nProviding for children\u2019s needs should be simple because their expenditures are relatively low. Child health care makes up less than nine percent of all federal health expenditures in the United States.\nBut because the health policy debate in the United States focuses on older populations, children are often left out.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we have these conversations about the unique needs of children,\u201d said Chamberlain.\nWise and Chamberlain hope to alert policy-makers to the fiscal needs of children and how they affect care for all kids."}

Our computer imaging is accurate. This would not be guesswork,\" he said.\nHowever, UNESCO prefers to leave the Buddhas' niches empty as a \"memorial to destruction\" and develop the Bamiyan area as a centre of cultural heritage, including a museum.\nThe two colossal standing statues and a sitting one were carved over 300 years out of the pink sandstone of a vast cliff, and completed around the year 500, archaeologists say.\nAt the time, the people of central Afghanistan - descendants of the Bakhtrian civilisation known to Alexander the Great and the ancient Romans - were Buddhists. Many however converted to Islam during the conquests of the 9th century.\nHistorians say that, apart from occasional efforts by Muslim rulers to destroy them, they were treated with reverence by local people until Taliban leader Mulla Umar declared them an affront to Islam.\nWhen efforts to bring them down with artillery fire failed, Afghans say, sappers bored holes into the statues and shattered them with explosives."}

Developers are obviously making a lot of money. And of course the government of China itself is getting rich and that\u2019s something that irks a lot of the people I spoke to. In the past five years, much of China\u2019s economic growth has come from building infrastructure. The party has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this and most of these contracts have gone to state-owned companies. So in other words, the government is giving money to itself.

The fall and rise of happiness levels in China mirror the trends seen in Russia and other European countries transitioning from communism, Easterlin said.\nBut what makes China especially interesting is that happiness levels dipped and rose while incomes were soaring, showing that joblessness can drag happiness levels down even as national wealth is on the rise. The results echo earlier studies that have found that growing wealth does not tend to increase happiness because expectations rise along with it. People also tend to compare their wealth with others\u2019.\nAt TIME, Austin Ramzy noted that Bo Xilai\u2019s gestures towards addressing economic inequality helped build his broad popularity among Chongqingers.\nWhen Bo Xilai, the rising Chinese Communist Party official who was purged in March, gave his last public comments before disappearing into detention, he was wrong about a lot of things. That bit about not being under investigation, for instance. But one line he uttered has the clear ring of truth, and it poses a serious issue for China\u2019s leadership as it attempts to navigate this year\u2019s political transition, the economic slowdown and the ripples loosed by Bo\u2019s removal. Bo revealed that China\u2019s Gini coefficient \u2014 a statistic that measures the gap between rich and poor \u2014 had entered into worrying territory.

Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s Civilian Conservation Corps began as an ambitious idea that ultimately sent millions of young people into the woods to plant trees, build trails, and restore the landscape, while providing an income for their struggling families. The \u201csewer socialists\u201d of early-20th-century Milwaukee, Wisconsin, earned a reputation for coupling their ideological values with commonsense projects like improved water, electricity, and sanitation systems. Their present-day comrades, the Democratic Socialists of America, drew praise last month when the group\u2019s New Orleans chapter launched a mutual-aid clinic to repair people\u2019s broken brake lights for free. And Bernie Sanders has funneled his immense popularity and idealism into an electrifying piece of legislation that would expand Medicare to all Americans, directly benefiting millions in the most intimate manner. All of these are examples worth lifting up and learning from.\nCity leaders too\u2014whether local elected officials or grassroots organizers\u2014are churning out a particularly promising blend of aspiration and application these days. From free-school-lunch programs and public banks to a rising West Coast tenants\u2019 movement bent on revitalizing rent control in the region, progressives are laboring at the level of local politics to build programs and policies that will turn this country into a less hostile and punitive place. As a brief respite from the endless flow of bad news in Trump\u2019s America, we offer a few stories of visionary pragmatism from the last month.\nFrom behind a phony Midwestern smirk and without a hint of irony, the billionaire heiress Betsy DeVos likes to tell people that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d She said as much to Bernie Sanders during her confirmation hearing as secretary of education last winter, and she gleefully repeated the slogan again at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. DeVos, though, didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. Her quip was mistaken then and, thanks to New York City\u2019s Department of Education, it is even more mistaken now.\nOn Thursday, September 7, the city rolled out a new program that will provide free lunch to all 1.1 million public-school students in the five boroughs. Although 75 percent of students in the city were already eligible for free lunch, this program will offer approximately 200,000 additional young people access to the program, and will save their families some $300 a year. What\u2019s more, since the program truly universal, those who rely on the program will no longer have to worry about being stigmatized for doing so.\nAccles\u2019s organization worked hard to make the new policy a reality. It built a coalition of elected officials, unions, parents, adolescent health organizations, and more to make sure Bill de Blasio followed through on what had been a promise during his 2013 bid for the mayor\u2019s office. The campaigners had initial success in 2014 when the city implemented universal free lunch in all of its stand-alone middle schools. Now, with the September announcement, their work is complete.\nNew York City\u2019s new program, in other words, will help tackle classism in the cafeteria. Even if our beloved education secretary doesn\u2019t like it, free lunch is real.\nCorporate banks, as everyone knows, have caused a hell of a lot of mischief in this country."}

The President sought spiritual advice from Graham in a private meeting shortly before the National Leadership Breakfast Forum at the Manila Hotel.\nGraham, who is in the country for a week-long prayer festival, said he and the President discussed the domestic political situation and \"how politics needs to be changed.\"\nHe said the President also expounded on her programs to eliminate poverty, terrorism, and illnesses such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS, and other social and economic problems.\nGraham said that in the United States, politics has become \"so vicious\" that it requires immediate reforms.\n\"There are so many attacks in my country.

If you do that, you\u2019ll have a lasting legacy,\" the evangelist said.\nGraham, president of the Christian evangelical group Samaritan\u2019s Purse, also blessed the President and the Philippines before he ended his prayer.\n\"Madame President, God bless you. God bless your nation, this great country of the Philippines,\" he said.\nBishop Fred Magbanua of the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC) also prayed over the President and asked the Lord to give her wisdom in addressing the problems of the country.\n\"You have chosen her to be our leader, the duly constituted authority at this time in the history of our nation.

Jennings has made it by fully embracing the new avenues of expression the Internet has created.\nFor Jennings, who spent the last decade pushing at the boundaries of contemporary country music, it constitutes a dramatic departure from his country roots that finds him turning his back on the Nashville music establishment much like his father did three decades before him.\n\"When I started doing this record, I was in a place where I had left my label, left my management I had down there in Nashville, and felt like I was at rock bottom,\" Jennings, 30, said in the studio of the hilltop home above West Hollywood he shares with his fianc\u00e9e, actress Drea De Matteo, and their 2-year-old daughter, Alabama. \"I was feeling pretty voiceless, and depressed. . . . At this point I'm thinking no one's going to buy my records anyway, and I just wanted to do something that was really fun and different and exciting.\"\n\"Black Ribbons\" was born, inspired during a cross-country RV trip with his family.\n\"I was driving the whole way,\" he said. \"We were in the middle of nowhere, and every night about midnight I'd hear these programs: everything that was on coast-to-coast stations to local radio -- whatever we could get on the AM dial we had. It was all this really scary talk about the ballooning police state, the globalization agendas and whatnot.\n\"Here I was with my family in the middle of America in this RV, and it was so beautiful to be with them, but everything outside the RV was scary and unknown,\" said Jennings, looking through mirrored aviator sunglasses like those his father favored, his dark hair falling past his shoulders and scraggly beard telegraphing the image of a Southern rocker. Although his albums with his hard-edged alt-country band the .357s tested the boundaries of mainstream tastes, \"Black Ribbons\" has bypassed those limits entirely, crafting a darkly atmospheric rock concept album about the last voice of true freedom in the land, a freewheeling late-night talk-show DJ called Will O' the Wisp, voiced by King.\nFans of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall,\" Roger Waters' \"Radio KAOS\" and Nine Inch Nails' \"The Downward Spiral\" will likely be empathetic to Jennings' album, with its searing extended guitar solos, spacey synthesizer textures and frequent bone-rattling hard-rock rhythms.\nThe effect of \"Black Ribbons\" is heightened considerably by King's droll, seemingly off-the-cuff riffs,"}

Outside of other creationists and evangelical Christians, nobody takes \u2018creation scientists\u2019 seriously. If these people were peddling their faith-polluted science in peer-reviewed journals and whatnot I think you\u2019d have a point, but since these people aren\u2019t really part of any respected scientific circles I wonder if it\u2019s appropriate to call them scientists in any meaningful sense. On the other hand, all 10 of the folks Dr. Heddle referred to in his challenge are respected members of the scientific establishment who publish in peer-reviewed journals and generally seem to be good scientists. If you could tell me how you detected the 5 religious scientists among them\u2013or how to detect the pollution of religion in any scientific endeavor that has managed to pass peer review\u2013I would be a bit more impressed.\nI brought up the creationists as an example simply of how faith based reasoning is unscientific. I never in any of this said that the creationists were considered legitimate scientists or that religious scientists as any kind of rule brought their faith into the laboratories. I cited the potential areas of conflict with Dr. Collins where he has explicitly said false things (like that altruism is not observed elsewhere in the animal kingdom) or showed a willingness to let dogmatic religious beliefs close off avenues of explanation.\nBut I was not arguing that any good scientists were bad scientists just because on Sunday mornings they jettisoned their laboratory\u2019s intellectual scruples at church. My focus of my point was that insofar as their science is good it does not employ faith. So faith and science are NOT compatible in the lab. And in a fully rationally scrupulous life, they\u2019re not coherently compatible in a full picture of the world where Monday-Friday, the world is investigable view critical reasoning. And on Sundays, centuries old arbitrary faith claims not subject to critical rejection are taken to have mystically guaranteed authority. That\u2019s the whole point.

Why the sudden surge in popularity?\nSarah Rotundo-Fergusson left school with three grade As at A-level, and an offer of a place at Cambridge University, so when she started work as a nursery assistant on a salary of less than \u00a311,000, there were more than a few raised eyebrows among family and friends. But, she says, there was method in her madness. While her peers were running up debt at university, she combined work with distance learning through the Open University (OU), achieving a 2:1 degree in childhood and youth studies.\nNow 24, Rotundo-Fergusson is manager of a day nursery in Berkshire with a company car and a good salary. She is also a homeowner and has her sights set firmly on promotion. By the age of 30, she hopes to be earning up to \u00a340,000 as an adviser in early years education. Meanwhile, her friends who chose more traditional higher education routes are trying to get their first foothold on the career ladder.\nShe admits that her parents were initially disappointed at her decision to study through the OU, which \"generally doesn't have the same prestige as other universities\". But the idea that it is somehow second-rate compared with campus-based universities is one of many misconceptions about the OU, she says.\nThe image of the bearded professor presenting BBC2 programmes broadcast in the early hours of the morning still prevails. And even to the more enlightened, the OU is often seen either as a \"last-chance saloon\" for those who messed up at school, or for \"recreational\" students such as the retired.\nThe truth is, the OU has always attracted a diverse range of students. What has changed in recent years is the number of young people choosing to studying through the OU. Those who still subscribe to the 1970s stereotype might be surprised to learn that 25% of new students enrolling with the OU are aged between 17 and 25. Over the last year, there has been a 36% increase in students in this age group. So why is the \"grey university\" suddenly so popular?\nChristina Lloyd, head of teaching and learner support at the OU, thinks it is partly to do with changing perceptions. The OU's focus on distance or \"open\" learning naturally lends itself to the use of new technologies, for example making use of the digital media player iTunes and video-sharing website YouTube to deliver lectures and resources, which appeals to internet-savvy young people.\nMore significant, perhaps, is money. Tuition fees are typically around \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 for an undergraduate degree through the OU, which compares favourably to \u00a39,000 for a full-time degree at a campus-based university (which of course excludes accommodation or other living costs).\nEarlier this month, the universities minister, David Willetts, announced proposals for nationally recognised degree programmes that would allow students to take prestigious courses, but save on the expense of living away from home by studying at their local university or college. He has strongly hinted that he thinks the cap on university tuition fees should rise, meaning the OU may still represent a more cost-effective option for those students unwilling or unable to run up vast amounts of student debt.\nThe latest Push Student Debt Survey estimates average student debt at over \u00a323,000"}

{"idx": "1692", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Will Foxglove Kill My Cats?\nFoxglove blooms best in cool weather.\nFoxgloves (Digitalis purpurea) add a splash of color to shady woodland gardens within U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 to 9 with their speckled, bell-shaped flowers. Their widespread presence in gardens lends them a harmless reputation, although foxgloves are actually highly toxic to humans and animals alike. Cats that ingest foxgloves can easily be killed if not promptly treated by a veterinarian, so it is best to limit contact between the plants and any curious four-legged foragers.\nFoxgloves have a distinctive appearance that makes them easily distinguishable from harmless annuals. They stand between 2 and 5 feet in height with a central flower stalk and a rosette of fuzzy, 5- to 10-inch-long leaves at the base. The tubular, bell-shaped flowers emerge from late spring into early summer and have a pendulous or nodding appearance. They are roughly 2 inches in length and come in shades ranging from cream to yellow to pale lavender, each with dark purple or white markings inside. All parts of foxglove are poisonous, although the seeds contain a much higher concentration of toxic elements than the leaves and flowers.\nCardiac glycosides are responsible for the extreme toxicity of foxgloves, but there are also several steroidal saponins within the plant that also cause damage after consumption. The cardiac glycosides effect actions within the heart, which causes the most severe and dangerous symptoms in foxglove poisoning. Due to their low body mass, cats need only consume a small amount of the plant to experience serious, potentially deadly symptoms. Cardiac glycosides cause rapid symptom progression, so recognizing the early signs is vital to ensuring the poisoned animal receives timely emergency care.\nCats may accidentally poison themselves by chewing or eating any part of a foxglove plant, or by drinking water from a vase used to hold cut foxglove flowers indoors. The visible symptoms of foxglove poisoning in cats mimic those of poisoning from other sources, although internal symptoms are much more severe. Vomiting, diarrhea and muscle weakness are prominent and noticeable, while cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure occur virtually unseen. Seek immediate medical attention if a cat displays worrying symptoms after interacting with or having access to a foxglove plant because coma and death may occur rapidly and without warning.\nFoxgloves will always pose a threat to pets and people, but it is possible to lower the risk of accidental poisoning with careful planning and maintenance. Plant foxgloves in a visible location to monitor interactions between them and pets, and install a barrier around the bed to discourage close contact. Rake up and discard any fallen leaves to keep them from blowing or getting dragged into areas where cats feed and play, and pour out irrigation water from potted foxgloves so that cats don't drink the water. When using foxgloves as a cut flower, place the vase on a high shelf where cats can't reach it or cover the top with aluminum foil to prevent the cat from drinking the water inside.\nMcMullen, S.. \"Will Foxglove Kill My Cats?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/foxglove-kill-cats-91814.html.

The Diocese of Venice declined to comment further on Ludden's departure.\n\"As I move forward, I ask you to continue to pray for me,\" Ludden wrote in his letter. \"I have been overwhelmed by the many cards and letters that I have received during this time. It is with gratitude that I look back on what has almost been 10 years at St. John the Evangelist.\"\nThe bishop's letter said the Rev. Thomas Zalewski, of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Bradenton, was appointed pastor at Saint John effective Oct. 8.\nZalewski previously served as a parochial vicar at St. Agnes Catholic Church in North Naples and St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Fort Myers, the letter states."}

Prices in Vancouver, Toronto and the surrounding areas are still surging, while they're falling in the provinces hit by the oil price slump, and stable most everywhere else.\n\"He explicitly told Canadians: 'Don't buy your home on the expectation of house price appreciation.' To me, that is a very clear signal that he's trying to restrain housing behaviour,\" said Frances Donald, a senior economist at Manulife in Toronto.\nMr. Poloz is in a tough spot, and only direct government intervention can alter the unique supply and demand conditions in these two cities, according to Ms. Donald. So Mr. Poloz is \"doubling down\" on his only effective tool: communications, she said.\n\"The Bank of Canada's biggest issue is that monetary policy affects the country uniformly,\" Ms. Donald explained. \"It's not capable of targeting particular regions.\"\nIn spite of the rising probability of a house price correction, the central bank insisted that the overall risk to Canada's financial system, while still high, is unchanged from six months ago, when it released its previous Financial System Review. That's because the economy is continuing to improve and the risk of a recession has decreased, according to the bank.\n\"The bank will not move rates to cool housing unless they view it as a broader risk to the economy,\" Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said in a research note.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in Thursday on rising house prices, acknowledging they're limiting opportunity for many young Canadians. \"Rising home prices, uncertainty around being able to buy your first home or upgrade as you want to grow a family is a real drag on our economy and a real drag on Canadians' opportunities,\" Mr. Trudeau told the Business News Network.\nEarlier this week, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government is doing a \"deep dive\" on what's going on in the housing market, but wouldn't commit to when he might take further steps to try to cool it down.\nPrices are now rising at a rate of roughly 25 per cent a year in Vancouver and 12 per cent in the Toronto area.

{"idx": "1705", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What Exactly Is A Home In Pre-Foreclosure?\nHome /National/Breaking National News/What Exactly Is A Home In Pre-Foreclosure?\nWhen you take out a mortgage on a home you are buying, you agree to pay monthly installments to the bank. When you fail to make your mortgage payments for 3 months you will receive a default notice that signifies you are officially in pre-foreclosure. This means that the bank will take legal action if you do not catch up on your late payments. You have the choice, at this time, to either make the late payments or sell your property before your home is officially foreclosed on.\nWhen the homeowner is officially in pre-foreclosure they usually are given anywhere from 3 to 10 months act before the property is officially foreclosed. The homeowner can make their missed payments during this time and the bank will then take the property out of pre-foreclosure.\nThe homeowner can also try to sell their home during this pre-foreclosure stage. If the homeowner owes more than the home is worth the bank may agree to a short sale. This means an interested party can purchase the home from the homeowner for less than the mortgage. This is a great option for a home buyer because it allows them to usually get a good deal on a home from a bank that is willing to accept the short sale instead of a foreclosure.\nThe bank must always approve the short sale before the realtor can proceed with the sale. They will run numbers and look at appraisals and neighborhood comps to make sure this is a fair deal for everyone.\nIs it better to short sale or foreclose on your property?\nIf you decide to short sale your home, there are definitely some benefits. You get to remain in control of your home and can also control the sale of your home. You also get to avoid that horrible stigma that comes with foreclosure.\nIf you are looking for an immediate solution you may want to foreclose. You can immediately stop payments on your home until the bank officially kicks you out. You are also not in control of the sale so you are not required to fix anything that is broken in the home.\nShort sale and foreclosure will both impact your credit score. Recent studies have shown both will affect your credit score in the same way. Your score may drop as many as 300 points. This will stay on your credit score for at least 7 years. This can affect your ability to purchase another home or a car. It can also make it difficult to get insurance. However, if you continue to pay your bills, keep your balances low, and are on time with your payments your credit score will slowly creep back up.\nIf you are looking to buy a home, you may wonder about purchasing pre foreclosure homes. A pre-foreclosure can be a great option because they are usually priced at a bargain. However, they are sometimes hard to find and hard to buy.\nJust because a homeowner is in pre-foreclosure doesn\u2019t mean their home is for sale. It just means that the bank has issued a notice of default on their property.\nA lot of times, homeowners in pre-foreclosure are open to selling their home to qualified buyers. To find pre-foreclosures you may want to start by looking online. Websites such as Zillow often times show homes that are in pre-foreclosure. Or, county newspapers or websites will sometimes post foreclosure notices.\nAfter you find a pre-foreclosure that interests you, go make sure it is a home you would want to buy. It is wise to drive by and check out the home and the property before you inquire further. If you are still interested, you could drop off a note or"}

But the study wanted to know - Is this the only benefit from these renewable resources? It has been shown that wind and solar could have local effects on heat, humidity, and other factors, and they can be beneficial and even in some cases, detrimental, depending on the particular region, according to Phys.org.\nThe Sahara Desert and the neighboring Sahel region were chosen for the study. The Sahara, because it is sparsely inhabited, and thus the development of wind and solar farms would have minimal competition for land surface area against natural and other human land uses, such as agriculture.\nThe Sahel is actually a transition region - a mix of desert and wooded savanna and, as such, is highly sensitive to land changes. In fact, in March a study supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, researchers from the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland found that the Sahara Desert has grown over 10 percent in the last century, pushing into the fragile Sahel.\nThe researchers also pointed out that the Sahara and Sahel are strategically located near Europe and the Middle East, areas with enormous current energy demand, and sub-Saharan Africa, which has a large projected growth in energy demand.\nIt is the feeling that massive investment in solar and wind energy, especially in the Sahel, one of the world's poorest regions, would promote economic development as well as clean energy for desalination and provision of water for cities and food production.\nResearch is underway to insure that wind turbine component parts will continue to live up to their functional life of over 20 years.\nThe wind and solar farms modeled in the study would cover more than 9 million square kilometers (3,5 million square miles) and generate, on average, about 3 terawatts and 79 terawatts of electrical power, respectively. \"In 2017, the global energy demand was only 18 terawatts, so this is obviously much more energy than is currently needed worldwide,\" Li said.\nThe research team found that wind farms caused regional warming of near-surface air temperature locally, with greater changes in minimum temperatures than maximum temperatures.

For decades birds' feathers showcase nature's most comforting material, but when it comes to making the warmest coats for active environments, companies have started to offer a new generation of synthetic insulation that enhances the natural properties of down with hydrophobic properties, breathability, and additional technologies for lightweight performance.\nCoreloft synthetic insulation doesn't attempt to mimic down, instead the non-woven insulation of polyester fibers of mixed sizes are crimped to trap air and retain warmth. Large fibers resist compaction to allow the use of looser weaves and lining fabrics to increase overall air flow.\nArc'teryx says the hydrophobic nature of Coreloft, which also dries quickly and retains warmth when wet, allows the technology to work in a variety of environments. Seen across a few lines of key insulation products, the Proton LT highlights the pros of combined fiber styles, some that stretch and some that provide structure, for the company's most breathable insulated jacket.\nColumbia has developed a TurboDown Wave insulation design that combines 900-fill down infused with a permanent water repellency with a 100 percent polyester Omni-Heat insulation. The wave pattern has a reflective layer using a silver dot pattern to reflect and retain warmth generated by the body back to the wearer.\nUsed in Columbia's hearty Heat Zone 1000, the synthetic fibers mimic the natural tendrils in feathers to retain loft. Wave-style construction also aims to eliminate cold spots.\nHelly Hansen partnered with PrimaLoft for its synthetic choices, using a 100 percent synthetic insulation that approaches the thermal performance of natural down but without the negatives when wet. Developed initially for the U.S. military, the latest ThermoPlume version is now in a blowable format, just like down, so it doesn't flatten.\nPhilip Tavell, category managing director for the ski category at Helly Hansen, says having insulation work even when wet proves crucial. By matching PrimaLoft with H2Flow technology, coats can help users remove moisture from the inside of the jacket through ventilating zippers, all while the synthetic insulation remains breathable.\nUsing a knit insulation, instead of a nonwoven variety, this Polartec Alpha synthetic won't compress, tear, or sag within the garment, says Lululemon. The open construction allows the insulation to dry quickly and completely, as dry air insulates better.\nSince the insulation stabilizes without moving through the garment, Lululemon pairs it with open and breathable fabrics for a fresh take on insulation. Adding in four-way stretch, sweat-wicking panels under the arms and water and wind protection on the outer portion of the jacket, the synthetic insulation puts a focus on breathable, thermal-regulation.\nDebuting in the brand-new Ventrix coat, The North Face has introduced a fresh synthetic-insulation technology designed to release excess heat through movement and exertion for balanced warmth. Using perforations in key areas, the coat expands and releases heat or contracts and retains heat with movement to keep users from overheating.\nShelby Collins, product line manager, says the insulation was specifically created to work with perforations, placing fabric perforations directly over the slits in the insulation to \"amplify the venting capabilities of the fabric-insulation package.\"\nPairing a stretchy air-permeable outer shell with a new Pol"}

But it\u2019s going to trickle out over years, even though DART has been working to speed things up.\nDART bus ridership dropped from 121,999 bus riders on an average weekday in 2015 to 113,095 in 2016. The downward trend has continued into the first few months of this year.\nBlame for the declining ridership has fallen on everything from a rebounding economy where more people can afford to drive, to changing housing patterns where fewer bus-dependent workers live on outdated bus routes. Some existing bus routes have never had a lot of traffic, and they exist as relics of past well-intentioned efforts to provide service where it turns out few people really needed it.\nEither way, the result is the same: Many buses just don\u2019t run when and where riders need them.\n\u201cDART has to make sure the core ridership is focused on ... so they can get from their home to work, schools or hospitals in a timely fashion,\u201d new DART board member Ray Jackson said last month. He told the Dallas City Council\u2019s transportation committee low-income riders need a system that works better for them.\nCustomers and city officials have long complained about routes where the buses don\u2019t travel the lines often enough and take hours to get them where they need to go. The problems are primarily in areas south of Interstate 30 where more people depend on public transportation.\nThe agency developed a comprehensive overhaul plan in 2014 and began to trickle out changes the following year with off-peak frequency improvements and bus connections to the Rowlett DART rail station.\nCentral to the overhaul is a long-term plan to create a \u201ccore frequent route network\u201d which would make buses run on their routes every 15 minutes or better during peak travel times, every 20 minutes or better during the midday and every 30 minutes or better on weekends.\nA DART bus pulls out of Union Station in downtown Dallas.\nThe agency also hopes to make some routes more direct, eliminate low-performing routes and expand the availability of weekend service.\nBut those changes require more buses and may be years away. Many customers and Dallas City Council members say they want bigger changes sooner.\nThe Dallas City Council voted unanimously last fall to make overhauling the bus system a top priority. That decision was cited in a recent effort to replace several of the city\u2019s DART board representatives.\nFour new DART board members \u2014 Catherine Cuellar, Dominique Torres, Ray Jackson and Jon-Bertrell Killen \u2014 were named earlier this month. Each said they\u2019d push hard to fix the bus network. And board member Patrick Kennedy, who started his term in January, told the council's transportation committee last month that he has been working closely with DART staff on issues plaguing the bus system.\nWhile speaking before the council\u2019s transportation committee last month, Kennedy said he hopes to add more buses to improve frequency, but there are also inefficiencies in the system that can be worked out, like duplicate services and buses running on the same routes as rail.\n\u201cIf we start heading more toward a gridded system, there is an opportunity for more intuition to be built in the network,\u201d he said.\nDART officials say they\u2019re working to speed up their long-term plans.\nIn August, DART will begin tinkering with bus routes that currently have poor on-time performance, mostly during the middle part of"}

I would have stated the exact time a trader wakes up, but we are all in a different timezone and with weird alarm times on our phones. The point is, waking up is usually the best time for a trader, unless they already have a losing trade running. If you left a trade open the previous day, then you check on it before your eyes are fully open, and it can be either very good or bad.\nNext thing is to check your favourite forex forum for gossip. Every trader has that one website they visit regularly just to read what other people have to say. This is the place you get most of your trading ideas and tips, and one of the few websites you don\u2019t need Google to help you find.

{"idx": "1717", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It is almost the end of 2018, and taxpayers have been subjected to a whirlwind of changes brought about by the effectivity of the first of five proposed comprehensive tax reform packages under the Duterte administration.\nIn response to the amendments to the Tax Code, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has been relentless with its flurry of advisories and issuances to ensure proper compliance and guidance, keeping the taxpayers\u2019 best interest in mind.\nUpon the enactment and the effectivity of the TRAIN Law, the revision to Section 249 has caused confusion among taxpayers and BIR officers alike. Consequently, there has been an inconsistent application of the interest rate on unpaid taxes, as well as on the computation of deficiency and delinquency interests due. Thankfully, the BIR has finally issued the regulations on interest last September to clear the air and settle the misunderstanding once and for all.\nWhile Section 2 of the RR echoes the revision found in the TRAIN Law, i.e. that the applicable rate of interest to be assessed and collected on any unpaid tax shall be double of the effective legal interest rate for loans or forbearances of any money in the absence of an express stipulation as set by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) from the date prescribed for payment until the amount is fully paid; RR No. 21-2018 now categorically states that under Section 249 of the Tax Code, the rate of interest imposable shall be 12 percent, which is double the rate of interest per BSP Memorandum Order No. 799 series of 2013 for loans or forbearances where no express stipulation of interest have been made. Hence, for interest payments for unpaid taxes due as of Jan. 1 until the full payment of the tax liability, the interest rate shall be at 12 percent. However, it should be noted that for taxpayers with tax liabilities and/or deficiency taxes due before the effectivity of the TRAIN Law, or up until Dec. 31, 2017, the applicable interest rate will still be 20 percent.\nMoreover, Section 5 of the regulation expressly states that there shall be no double or simultaneous imposition of interest, in view of the implementation of the TRAIN Law. Prior to the enactment of RA No. 10963, taxpayers have to deal with the double imposition of deficiency and delinquency interests, which becomes burdensome to those who are unable to settle their unpaid taxes on time.\nThe revision in the last statement of Section 249(B) on the definition of a deficiency interest from \u201cinterest shall be assessed and collected from the date prescribed for its payment until the full payment thereof\u201d to include a second condition \u201cor upon issuance of a notice and demand by the commissioner or his authorized representative, whichever comes first\u201d paved the way for the interpretation that deficiency and delinquency interests may no longer be simultaneously imposed. As illustrated in the RR, deficiency interest at 12 percent shall be imposed for unpaid taxes up until the deadline for payment stated in the notice or demand issued by the commissioner.

When he sat down on the wrestling mat at Ano Liossia Hall on Wednesday night, he could not hold back a flood of tears as he unlaced his shoes. He left them in the center of the mat, a wrestling tradition that signifies the end of a career, and left his final Olympics with a bronze medal to go with the improbable gold he won four years ago in Sydney.\nTwo gigantic men with a particular interest in Rulon Gardner sat in the stands at Ano Liossia Olympic Hall on Tuesday watching him advance through the preliminary round of Greco-Roman wrestling: one saying nothing and refusing to acknowledge the obvious, the other cheering loud enough for Gardner to pick out his voice from the chaotic din of the crowd. The silence came from Aleksandr Karelin, the legendary Russian wrestler whom Gardner defeated in the gold-medal match in the 2000 Sydney Games, a victory that became an Olympic moment. Four years later, the retired Karelin responds to no questions about Gardner, any hint of a smile disappearing at the mention of his name.\nRulon Gardner has already accomplished the impossible, defeating a legend and defying death. So what is left? Another gold medal. That was the thought that kept him alive on a frozen February night two years ago when he got lost while snowmobiling alone in a mountain valley in Wyoming. He thought of how he had upset the previously undefeated Greco-Roman super heavyweight wrestler from Russia, Aleksandr Karelin, transforming himself from a humble dairy farmer into an Olympic icon at the 2000 Sydney Games after his so-called Miracle on the Mat.\nThe"}

When another former PM, John Diefenbaker, saw what the artist had created, he dismissed it as \"a diabolical creature.\" Dief thought the depiction of Meighen might well be \"the greatest monstrosity ever produced \u2013 a mixture of Ichabod Crane and Daddy Longlegs.\"\nMeighen's wife, Isabel, was so put off that she wanted nothing to do with it. For 20 years the statue was hidden away, stored in a concrete vault near the Rideau Canal, until finally it was shipped off to Meighen's hometown, St. Mary's, Ont., where it stands today as a monument to a local boy who made good in life, if less so in art.\nNow, all of Ottawa is talking about another looming disaster \u2013 a memorial to the Victims of Communism that is about to take over a parcel of land between the Supreme Court of Canada and the National Library, a small park-like oasis along Wellington Street where, this past week, there were only squirrel tracks to be found in the fresh-fallen snow.\nThat land is said to be worth $1-million. For nearly a century it had been earmarked as the site of a new federal court, but has now been handed over for the memorial, along with a pledge of $3-million to help pay for the $5-million project \u2013 the remainder to be raised by a charity group called Tribute to Liberty.\nCanada is, of course, the recognized world leader in apologies. Only a fool would deny that millions have been the tragic victims of communism, but that number pales, surely, in comparison with the victims of capitalism. If we agree to date communism to the Russian Revolution of 1917 \u2013 feel free to argue the point \u2013 the dating of capitalism's crimes would have to extend back beyond the Crusades and the spice wars to the very first deal that went badly sour.\nRegardless of that, and despite the fact that there is already a most-impressive and expensive Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg, this new memorial in Ottawa is going ahead.\nBut it certainly isn't going smoothly.

They lost in overtime 90-84.\nIn a fight they were never thought to have a chance in, the Stanford men\u2019s basketball team (4-4) put up a formidable performance against nationally No. 2-ranked Kansas (6-0) but was ultimately defeated in overtime by a final score of 90-84.\nThe first quarter was a flurry of action down and back on the court. With only 12 minutes played in the first quarter, the score was 17-15, and eight total lead changes had occurred.\nStanford\u2019s capability to score on pace with Kansas was a surprise to the Jayhawks. In a play just five minutes into the first quarter, the ball was driven to the hoop by sophomore forward KZ Okpala, drawing defenders to the hoop, leaving sophomore guard Isaac White open for a corner three. White, receiving a season high in minutes with freshman guard Cormac Ryan in foul trouble, shot 5-7 from three and was the primary reason the Cardinal were in the game. White ended the game with 15 total points.\nThe first half was also filled with effective strategies of defensive on both sides. The Cardinal kept the game close with a top-ranked opponent full of NBA talent and one-and-done players.\nWith three minutes left in the half, the Kansas defensive was inactive, leaving senior center Josh Sharma wide open and side shuffling to the hoop. Mid-jump, he received the pass and slammed it into the basket for a powerful alley-oop. The next play Kansas answered with a quick jumper above the free throw line that swished through the net. The half ended with Stanford in the lead, 35-29.\nStanford was able to capitalize on its six-point advantage and continue the lead through almost half of the second half. With only nine minutes left, the Stanford defense started to develop holes.\nThe Kansas offense had multiple plays where the defense was diverted by the Jayhawks\u2019 Devon Dotson and Lagerald Vick. Vick knocked down three-pointer after three-pointer towards the end of the second half.\nIt was Vick\u2019s hot hand that proved to be the nail in the coffin for the Cardinal. With plays by the Cardinal and Kansas answering each other shot for shot, Stanford could not extend its lead, and the Jayhawks could not move in front. With less than 20 seconds left, the Cardinal led the game 75-72. But a prayer three from Vick ignited the Kansas field house and left the Cardinal shaking their heads as the game headed to overtime.\nVick scored another three at the start of overtime. The Stanford defense started to unravel, thanks in part to the absence of Sharma, who had fouled out, as the Kansas team obliterated the scoreboard in overtime. Kansas had multiple back to back plays resulting in points. From a three-pointer to a slam dunk to an alley-oop, Kansas was in control of overtime from start to finish. What started as an impressive effort by the Cardinal to nearly upset a top-ranked opponent ended in a Cardinal victory out of reach.\nOverall, Stanford\u2019s shooting was much improved this game with a season record of 12 three-pointers.\nThe whirlwind game\u2019s final score was 90-84, with the Kansas Jayhawks"}

{"idx": "1732", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: 3 Does Not Eating Affect an Athlete's Performance?\n4 What Are Negative Results from Eating No Carbs?\nAlthough going low-carb or low-fat may help some people lose weight, combining the two diets can spell trouble for your health as well as your enjoyment of life. What's more, cutting food groups is no guarantee of weight loss. You shed fat by consuming fewer calories than your body burns for energy, no matter what types of fare you choose.\nOnly three macronutrient groups provide calories: fat, carbohydrates and protein. Cut out the fat and carbs, and you're left with just protein. Most Americans already consume more protein than they need, and a low-carb, low-fat diet can easily lead to dangerous protein intake. Your body uses extra water to process protein, so consuming too much may contribute to dehydration -- already a concern on a reduced-calorie diet. Excessive protein intake may also cause you to expel too much calcium in your urine, possibly weakening your bones, according to Jessica Matthews, professor of exercise science at Miramar College. This may eventually increase your risk of osteoporosis, a condition in which bones grow brittle and prone to fracture.\nBecause the primary options on a low-carb, low-fat plan are lean proteins, your diet may become too limited for optimal nutrition. You'll miss out on healthy whole grains, nuts, olive oil and many fruits and vegetables. These \"taboo\" foods are rich in nutrients that your body needs, such as fiber, heart-healthy unsaturated fats and an array of vitamins and minerals. A healthier idea is to simply cut out refined carbs such as white bread -- which are lower in nutrients than whole-wheat bread and other unrefined grains -- and curb cholesterol-spiking saturated fats from butter, fatty meats and full-fat dairy.\nThe key to weight-loss success is developing healthy habits, not depriving yourself. As the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics notes, any plan that you can't see yourself following for the rest of your life is not the right diet for you. Eating little besides lean meat, fish, egg whites and select vegetables is not sustainable for most people, and you'll likely become bored or frustrated before long. Even if you do lose some weight, you will not have learned the skills you need to keep it off for good.\nFor healthy, sustainable weight loss, build a diet that includes sensible portions of all food groups. The publication \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010\" recommends getting 45 percent to 65 percent of your daily calories from carbohydrates, 20 percent to 35 percent from fat and just 10 percent to 35 percent of your calories from protein. If you're set on reducing at least some fat and carbs in your diet, stick to the high end of the protein range and the lower end for the remaining macronutrients.\nAmerican Council on Exercise: Are There Health Risks Concerning Eating Too Much Protein?\nK., Nina. \"Problems Combining Low Fat With Low Carb.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/problems-combining-low-fat-low-carb-11543.html. 07 December 2018."}

At this year's CES, we noticed a variety of tech options hoping to help reverse these side effects, and we found ourselves wondering\u2014can new tech devices save us from our tech addictions?\nWe decided to investigate this trend while at the largest tech trade show in the world, which led us to discover Umay Rest, an electronic eye mask. Umay Rest is based on the principle that specific doses of thermotechnology can help reverse screen-time side effects such as strained eyes. Every time we blink, a small trace of oil is released into our eyes. When we blink less while staring at a screen, this natural process doesn't happen as often, leaving our eyes dry and irritated. Heat reactivates that oil, releasing it onto our eyes to relieve discomfort. Not only does Umay Rest help reset your eyes physically, but the idea of closing your eyes for a few minutes to recover from your day also has positive mental effects.\nReady to try Umay Rest out for yourself or give the gift of combating screen time to a loved one?

My flight was delayed and eventually canceled. Jet Airways promised me $1,360 under EC 261, the European airline consumer protection regulation.\nI sent Jet Airways an EC 261 claim. Within three days, the airline responded, and it agreed to pay 600 euros to my wife and me. Jet Airways requested copies of our passports, the boarding passes, and our signatures on a release and discharge letter. I sent everything they were requesting that same day, but have not heard back from them since.\nIt\u2019s been more than a week since I sent the forms. Should I be worried?\nA. You should not be worried. Processing a claim under EC 261 takes time \u2014 weeks, months, and in some rare cases, even years. But one thing you should worry about a little is whether you had a valid claim. In recent weeks, I\u2019ve seen an uptick of cases involving an airline promising a refund under EC 261 but then not delivering.\nWhat\u2019s EC 261? It\u2019s the European airline consumer protection rule that says if an airline delays your flight, it will compensate you. There are important exceptions. For example, some flights and some situations, like air traffic control delays, aren\u2019t covered. But typically, when an airline agrees to pay your claim, it\u2019s a done deal.\nI told you to wait \u2014 and you did. A month passed. Nothing. Another month. Still nothing. You contacted me again, asking about your EC 261 claim, and that\u2019s when I became worried. I recommended that you reach out to someone at Jet Airways about your claim. I list the names, numbers, and e-mail addresses for the customer service executives at Jet Airways on my nonprofit consumer-advocacy site. Finally, I became so concerned that I also reached out to Jet Airways on your behalf. Although EC 261 doesn\u2019t require an airline to process a claim within a certain amount of time, two months really seems to be pushing it.\nJet Airways paid you $1,360, the full value of your claim.\nChristopher Elliott can be reached at chris@elliott.org."}

{"idx": "1748", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Six years after the Higgs boson was discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physicists announced last week that they have observed how the elusive particle decays. The finding, presented by ATLAS and CMS collaborations, observed the Higgs boson decaying to fundamental particles known as bottom quarks.\nIn 2012, the Nobel-winning discovery of the Higgs boson validated the Standard Model of physics, which also predicts that about 60% of the time a Higgs boson will decay to a pair of bottom quarks. According to CERN, \u201ctesting this prediction is crucial because the result will either lend support to the Standard Model \u2014 which is built upon the idea that the Higgs field endows quarks and other fundamental particles with mass \u2014 or rock its foundations and point to new physics\u201d.\nThe Higgs boson was detected by studying collisions of particles at different energies. But they last only for one zeptosecond, which is 0.000000000000000000001 seconds, so detecting and studying their properties requires an incredible amount of energy and advanced detectors. CERN announced earlier this year that it is getting a massive upgrade, which will be completed by 2026.\nParticle physics probes nature at extreme scales, to understand the fundamental constituents of matter. Just like grammar and vocabulary guide (and constrain) our communication, particles communicate with each other in accordance with certain rules which are embedded in what are known as the \u2018four fundamental interactions\u2019. The particles and three of these interactions are successfully described by a unified approach known as the Standard Model. The SM is a framework that required the existence of a particle called the Higgs boson, and one of the major aims of the LHC was to search for the Higgs boson.\nHow are such tiny particles studied?\nProtons are collected in bunches, accelerated to nearly the speed of light and made to collide. Many particles emerge from such a collision, termed as an event. The emergent particles exhibit an apparently random pattern but follow underlying laws that govern part of their behaviour. Studying the patterns in the emission of these particles help us understand the properties and structure of particles.\nInitially, the LHC provided collisions at unprecedented energies allowing us to focus on studying new territories. But, it is now time to increase the discovery potential of the LHC by recording a larger number of events.\nSo, what will an upgrade mean?\nAfter discovering the Higgs boson, it is imperative to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and its effect on all other particles. This requires a large number of Higgs bosons. The SM has its shortcomings, and there are alternative models that fill these gaps. The validity of these and other models that provide an alternative to SM can be tested by experimenting to check their predictions. Some of these predictions, including signals for \u201cdark matter\u201d, \u201csupersymmetric particles\u201d and other deep mysteries of nature are very rare, and hence difficult to observe, further necessitating the need of a High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).\nImagine trying to find a rare variety of diamond amongst a very large number of apparently similar looking pieces. The time taken to find the coveted diamond will depend on the number of pieces provided per unit time for inspection, and the time taken in inspection. To complete this task faster, we need to increase the number of pieces provided and inspect faster. In the process, some new pieces of diamond, hitherto unobserved and unknown, may be discovered, changing our perspective about rare varieties of diamonds.\nOnce up"}

After all, a million is a lot, right? So therefore, the pilot project must be a success.\nThere\u2019s no doubt the fact that the Laurier Avenue bike lanes have been used a million times over the last three years will become an argument for more city investment in cycling infrastructure. After all, a million is a lot, right? So therefore, the pilot project must be a success.\nIndeed, although historical data was collected using a different method from the electronic counters along Laurier, it appears the segregated lanes have inspired more people to bike downtown. Clearly, some cyclists have simply moved over to Laurier instead of using other streets. But according to the city there has also been an overall increase in downtown cycling since the lanes were built.\nThat\u2019s encouraging news. And it\u2019s not particularly surprising. The city was lacking an obvious east-west bicycle route across downtown; other pathways stopped suddenly when cyclists reached the edges of the core. For cyclists who would prefer not to share their route with cars, downtown was a significant obstacle.\nBut decisions about more segregated bike lanes shouldn\u2019t be made on this result alone. For one thing, there\u2019s still a fundamental problem that no bike lane can overcome. We can make Ottawa\u2019s roads bike-friendly, but we can\u2019t make our climate so.\nThe evidence from Laurier Avenue proves the point: about 10 times as many people have used the bike lanes in July compared to January. There will always be diehard winter cyclists, but they represent a small fraction of even the cycling community, with or without special infrastructure. We can build hundreds of kilometres of segregated bike lanes and borrow dozens of other ideas from European cities like Copenhagen, but Ottawa will still be bike-hostile for five or six months of the year.\nSo if the goal is to make it easier and safer for existing cyclists to get around, to encourage a few more people to ride their bikes in good weather, and to make Ottawa more appealing to summer visitors who will choose a destination based in part on its recreational amenities, the bike lanes on Laurier are clearly a success.\nBut if the city intends to invest in more cycling infrastructure with the goal significantly changing commuting habits, as some councillors suggest, we should see a more comprehensive business case.\nIn particular, just how many people do we expect to abandon their cars if we build more bike lanes? And in what months? For a good portion of the period when Ottawa\u2019s climate is friendly, vehicular congestion is much less of an issue. From late June to early September, the city has lower traffic volume. So any significant benefit from alleviating congestion can only happen in parts of April, May, June, September and October.\nReducing car traffic isn\u2019t just about improving commute times, of course. There are other benefits to having more people cycling to work. But we must also look at the price of the investment and the alternatives. What would be the cost and benefit, for example, of plowing more of the NCC\u2019s recreational pathways in the winter, compared to building new bike lanes?\nUltimately, we must determine a reasonable target for the number of people who will ever be willing to commute on their bikes and ensure the investment lines up with the return.

In collaboration with longstanding Mona chef Vince Trim, Kaechele has designed a nine-course degustation feast, some of which is based on recipes in the book, which include sweet-and-sour cane-toad legs, myna-bird parfait, fox tikka masala and, most controversially, coal-roasted cat.\nKaechele chides the reporters for being salacious. Slightly more rattled is chef Trim, who wants to make it clear that cat won\u2019t be made available to the paying public at the feasts held at Mona from now until June. It\u2019s legal to eat cat, he says, but illegal to sell as food. And no, he\u2019s not going to describe the taste.\nTonight, the feast will be served to 72 friends and journalists for free, so cat consomm\u00e9 is on the menu. The guests will sit on bum-shaped poufs along the length of the glockenspiel, which doubles as a grand dining table and is itself made of fat from the deer that roam the Marion Bay property of Kaechele and Walsh, as well as camel fat, tapioca and wakame.\nThey\u2019ll dine amid the accompanying Eat the Problem exhibition, comprised of the glockenspiel itself, on which there will be regular performances by musicians using giant mallets; Elena Stonaker\u2019s psychedelic sculpture garden; and living sculptures in the reclining bodies receiving healing treatments.\nIt was in her former home of New Orleans, that Kaechele first established sustainable architecture projects lauded by the cultural elite.

For by calling for my \u201cdisavowal,\u201d they prove beyond a doubt that they cannot tolerate even some elementary cultural criticism\u2014criticism that is endorsed and praised by some of the most respected thinkers within our movement and beyond.\nIn fact, I am pretty delighted with the outraged reactions to my thoughts. I guess it enables us to map the discourse and its boundaries\u2014and means that those boundaries are now official. Not only has my latest book, The Wandering Who?, rocked the boat, but it also has managed to unite Alan Dershowitz and Abe Foxman with Ali Abunimah and Max Blumenthal. That is pretty encouraging: it means that peace may prevail after all.\nHowever, I also have some bad news for my would-be silencers, Palestinian and Jewish alike. I do not have any plans to slow down or drift away. I am a jazz musician and an independent thinker. I am basically a free agent\u2014I say what I think and think what I say. The popularity of my writing among Palestinians, solidarity activists and truth seekers is the direct outcome of my sincere approach to the subject matter.\nWhether my detractors accept it or not, the strength of my arguments is grounded on the transparent truthful nature of my premises. Until now, not one of my opponents has been able to point out a single discrepancy within my argument or the facts I cite. For instance, I contend that since Israel defines itself as the Jewish State\u2014its tanks and planes decorated with Jewish symbols\u2014it is our duty to ask: Who are the Jews? What is Judaism?

If you live in zero-dimensional space, you are stuck with nowhere to go and nothing to do.\nOne-dimensional space is a series of neighboring points. If you move in the first dimension, you find yourself on a different point. We call this a line.\nTwo-dimensional space is a series of neighboring spaces. If you move in the second dimension, you find yourself on a different line. We call this a plane.\nFour-dimensional space is a series of neighboring spaces. (Wait, you say, isn't the fourth dimension time? We'll get to that in a moment.) Anyway, if you move sideways in the fourth dimension, you find yourself in a different space. It's that simple. However, figuring out how to visualize it can be difficult.\nAs in the first dimension, every point on a 4-D cube should be \u201ctouching\u201d the corresponding point on its neighboring cubes, But if we try to draw it that way, with all the cubes right on top of one another, we just get a jumble.\nAnd frankly, cubes are hard enough to draw as it is.\nPeople have tried all kinds of ways of showing 4-D shapes, some more effective than others. One of the most popular ways is to show the fourth dimension receding toward the center of the object. This is a 4-D version of perspective drawing.\nTime is always a little confusing. Time is a dimension, but for us humans, it's a little different from the space dimensions, so we don't always include it when we're making a list. The main reason time is different is obvious: You can move back and forth in all three space dimensions, but you're pushed (almost) steadily forward in the time dimension throughout your life, with no going back.\nWhen we talk about four-dimensional stuff, we usually mean four dimensions of space\u2014plus, optionally, one of time. So a true four-dimensional creature would exist in five dimensions altogether. We humans get only three dimensions of space, but some people include time and call us four-dimensional. This is just an ambiguity of language, and there's no getting around it. Here are some things with different numbers of dimensions.\nThe idea that time is a dimension is really not so strange. We often use a space dimension as a stand-in to represent a time dimension. A drawing of something has two space dimensions. If both space dimensions in the drawing represent space dimensions in real life, we call it a map or a picture. If one of them represents the time dimension, we call it a graph.\nMovies and comics are different. Movies use the time dimension\u2014changing over time\u2014while comics are static. In this way, movies have one dimension of time, while comics have zero. Both movies and comics have two spatial dimensions, because they're both designed to be projected onto the two-dimensional retinas in our eyes. \u201c3-D\u201d movies aren't really three-dimensional; they're effectively 2-D images with a little bit of additional depth information.\nMovies show changes over time by having the picture change over time. They show the passage of time using time itself. You could also use the third spatial dimension to represent time, lining up all the images to make a cube. We don't usually do this\u2014partly because it requires a 3-D printer, but also because our two-dimensional retinas can't see the inside of the cube. If there are too many objects, they block each other and we can't see them all at once.\nThis is what comics do."}

{"idx": "1762", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Nearly a third of properties in the private rented sector contain major safety hazards, according to data contained in a government survey of UK housing stock.\nThe annual English Housing Survey shows that 28.2% of dwellings in the private rented sector have a category 1 hazard compared to 14.5% of local authority housing, 10.8% of housing association accommodation, and 21.5% of owner-occupied dwellings.\nHazards qualifying as category 1 under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System include those that can cause death, lung cancer, permanent loss of consciousness, 80% burn injuries, the loss of a hand or foot, eye disorders, heart attacks and poisoning. Under the Housing Act 2004, these types of hazard create an obligation for local authorities to either force the property to be vacated or to require immediate repair.\nThe most dangerous type of property is converted flats, with 37.7% containing at least one category 1 hazard. Older properties are also more dangerous, with 41% of buildings constructed before 1919 containing category 1 hazards compared to 4.6% of properties built in the past 20 years.\nA total of almost 5m properties contain such hazards, with the most commonly occurring being those that cause falls, such as showers and baths, stairs with poorly fitted handles and grab rails, and inadequate space.\nNewspapers recently reported how an 85-year-old man in Hackney, east London, became trapped in his bath with no food or heating for five days after falling into the tub. Fortunately he was able to drink from the sink next to his head (suggesting there was very little space in the bathroom) and was only rescued after friends became worried about his absence.\nThe second biggest hazard, particularly for those aged 45 or more, was excess cold. The survey said a healthy indoor temperature was about 21C, and serious health risks occur once the temperature falls below 16C, while below 10C the risk of hypothermia becomes \"appreciable, especially for the elderly\".\nIt said: \"The percentage rise in deaths in winter is greater in dwellings with low energy efficiency ratings. There is a gradient of risk with age of the property, the risk being greatest in dwellings built before 1850, and lowest in the more energy efficient dwellings built after 1980.\"\nOther hazards included pollutants such as asbestos, biocides, carbon monoxide, lead and radiation, electrical hazards and fire. Although occupier behaviour was a major factor in more than 80% of fires, more than 2,000 fires a year are associated with wiring and cabling.\nElectronic conveyancing company SearchFlow estimates it would cost UK property owners more than \u00a352bn to eradicate the hazards and make repairs. However, the majority of hazards can be remedied relatively cheaply, it said, with the cost of repairing stairs, for example, to remove a category 1 hazard less than \u00a31,000 in 85% of cases.\nStuart Pearce, chief exceutive of SearchFlow, said: \"When private dwellings are assessed by local authorities, there's a one in five chance there will be a hazard present which requires immediate attention. This is a cost most property owners don't factor into their plans and can therefore prove very hard to deal with.\n\"If you don't make the required repairs \u2013 even if you can't afford to \u2013 local"}

{"idx": "1764", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A New York judge did the right thing last week when he threw out a USA-PATRIOT Act provision that forced ISPs to secretly co-operate with the FBI, and gave them no obvious avenue for appeal. It is \"under the pressing exigencies of crisis that there is the greatest temptation to dispense with fundamental constitutional guarantees which, it is feared, will inhibit government action.\"\nSo stated United States District Judge Victor Marrero last week when he quoted a 1962 Supreme Court case in striking down the U.S. government's use of \"National Security Letters\" (NSLs) to force ISPs to give the FBI information about their subscribers. In essence, the court objected to the USA-PATRIOT Act's thesis that the enemy of the US government was a bunch of old men in robes. No, not the Taliban; the federal judiciary.\nThere are many ways for the government to get your ISP information. They can simply ask for it, and in many cases, ISPs have been more than willing to pony it up. If there is a criminal investigation, they can get a search warrant from a magistrate. They can issue a subpoena in the name of a federal or state grand jury. For foreign espionage and related cases, they can get a warrant from a special \"FISA\" court without having to show that there was a crime committed. In civil cases (say, your average defamation case, or copyright infringement) they can just issue a subpoena duces tecum to the ISP. Finally, many government agencies have the authority to - on their own, and without the courts - issue what are called \"administrative subpoenas\", which don't require a judge's approval in advance, but still can't be enforced without going to court.\nSo the old guys in the black robes can eventually get involved in all of these methods of getting your ISP information.\nIn the wake of the horrific acts of 11 September 2001, Congress passed the USA-PATRIOT Act, one provision of which allowed the FBI, upon a certification that the information was \"relevant\" to a terrorism investigation, to issue NSLs to ISPs. The statute said that the ISP \"shall comply with a request for subscriber information and toll billing records information, or electronic communication transactional records\", and that no ISP or its officers, employees or agents may \"disclose to any person that the FBI has sought or obtained access to [the] information or records\". In other words, if the FBI certifies that the records are relevant, the ISP must produce them, and may not ever tell anyone about the request.\nLet's face it, terrorism investigations are a special breed, and disclosure of their existence and direction can imperil not only the investigation itself but also the lives of government agents, sources, cooperating witnesses, and potentially thousands of innocent potential victims of future terrorist attacks. Courts may not always appreciate the sensitivity of individual pieces of information, and certainly ISPs are unlikely to be able to discern what information should be secret, and what information may safely be revealed. Thus, there is an understandable justification for the government's desire to protect these sensitive investigations.\nBut the statute Congress passed completely bypassed the federal judiciary. The courts had essentially no role in the process. They were precluded from determining if the government's claim that there was a terrorism investigation was supported by any evidence at all. The government also had to certify that the investigation was not solely of activities protected under the First Amendment. Without being able to review the"}

Younger generations will likely benefit most from these advances because they will be able to use them more extensively, but a new study shows that Baby Boomers still hold a health edge over Gen X\u2019ers and Millennials in some matters.\nResearchers from the American Cancer Society (ACS) have found that colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates are rising for young and middle-aged adults. They point out that three in ten rectal cancer diagnoses are now happening to patients under the age of 55.\nThe trend started to develop in the 1970s and 1980s, but recent research shows that CRC cases are now rising at an historic pace and rival rates seen in 17th century.\n\u201cTrends in young people are a bellwether for the future disease burden. Our finding that colorectal cancer risk for millennials has escalated back to the level of those born in the late 1800s is very sobering,\u201d said Rebecca Siegel, an investigator for the ACS.\nCRC incidence rates were not always out of control; in fact, they had been on the decline until the mid-1980s. However, rates began to rise by 1-2 percent on an annual basis in adults between the ages of 20 and 39, and by 0.5-1 percent in adults 40-54.\nCases of rectal cancer, in particular, grew rapidly between 1974 and 2013. The disease rose in incidence by 3% annually for adults in their 20\u2019s. The same rate of growth was recorded for adults between the ages of 30 and 39 between 1980 and 2013.\nThe rise in cases is somewhat baffling because the study shows that older consumers are affected at far lower rates than their younger counterparts. The researchers found that, compared to people born around 1950, those born in 1990 are twice as likely to develop colon cancer and four times as likely to develop rectal cancer.\nWhile further explanation is still wanting for what caused CRC rates to increase among younger people at such an astonishing rate, the researchers say that there are proactive steps that can be taken. They suggest that health professionals initiate screening for the diseases earlier and actively promote healthier lifestyle choices for their patients.\n\u201cEducational campaigns are needed to alert clinicians and the general public about this increase to help reduce delays in diagnosis, which are so prevalent in young people, but also to encourage healthier eating and more active lifestyles to try to reverse this trend,\u201d said Siegel.\nThe full study has been published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute."}

The presidential flight landed without incident at Andrews six minutes later.\nPresident Donald Trump steps off Air Force One as he arrives April 9, 2017, at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.\nSeveral journalists, including a VOA correspondent aboard the flight witnessed the incident after being alerted by Associated Press staff photographer Alex Brandon who managed to snap a picture of the other plane after it approached at a slightly lower altitude from the north and veered off to the starboard (right) side of Air Force One.\nThose from the media who saw the other plane, including a television audio technician who has been flying on Air Force One since the Carter administration, agreed they had never witnessed such a close encounter aboard the presidential aircraft.\n\u201cI would say beyond all doubt that this is a strange occurrence,\u201d said a retired U.S. Air Force Lt.

The wing includes the Presidential Airlift Group, which operates the VC-25 military plane, a military version of the Boeing 747, that has the call sign Air Force One when the president is aboard.\nNo one answered the phone at Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control, which controls airspace over Andrews and more than four major commercial airports in the metropolitan region.\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House and it is unknown whether President Trump or any other senior officials aboard the flight from Florida's Palm Beach International Airport were made aware of the situation.\nAmong others on the flight were the president's chief strategist Steve Bannon; adviser Stephen Miller, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, Joe Hagin.\nReporters in the press cabin quickly turned their attention back to the TV screens showing a live broadcast of the Masters golf tournament during the final minutes of the otherwise uneventful flight during which the president did not come to the back of the plane to speak to reporters.\nTrump was returning from a four-day stay at his Mar-a-Lago resort where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and ordered a missile strike against an airfield from where the Syrian air force had launched planes that allegedly dropped sarin nerve gas on civilians in rebel-held territory."}

Maenius said.\n\u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s an up market and this is reflective of that,\u201d Maenius said.\nBut real estate agent Lucy Puniwai, who works in the Alliance corridor, said many clients have been upset with TAD as their appraisals have jumped by $25,000 to $30,000. She said values are up and multiple bidders are often vying for homes but she believes that TAD is overreaching with its appraisals.\nThis year, TAD increased the value on about 260,000 existing accounts. Of those, 166,000 had a jump from 5 to 10 percent; 63,000 increased by less than 5 percent; and about 31,000 went up by more than 10 percent.\nAmong commercial properties, apartments increased 25 percent, office space jumped 20 percent, retail climbed 15 percent and warehouses had a 10 percent increase.\n\u201cFor Tarrant County, it\u2019s pretty much been countywide,\u201d said Bill Makens, chairman of the Fort Worth Society of Commercial Realtors and an associate with the Makens Co.\n\u201cYou just have a lot of retailers that have become active again and DFW is an attractive market to a lot of retailers,\u201d Makens said.\nAmong apartment complexes, the higher-end properties \u2014 those that are considered Class A and Class B \u2014 have had the biggest increases.\nThere was also a big increase in mineral interest accounts, from 404,000 to 719,000. The overall value increased by $500 million from $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion.\nThe preliminary TAD appraisals are important to local governments because they use these numbers to start building budgets for the next fiscal year.

If I want to win 1-0, I think I can, as I think it\u2019s one of the easiest things in football. It\u2019s not so difficult, as you don\u2019t give players the chance to express themselves.\"\nSince the beginning of November, Chelsea have played six away matches. They beat West Ham United comfortably enough in the Premier League, but other than that, Mourinho\u2019s side have lost to Basel (1-0) in the Champions League and to Newcastle (2-0) and Stoke (3-2) in the Premier League. Chelsea did beat Sunderland 4-3 in a chaotic league match, but the vulnerability evident then was exposed on Tuesday. Nor have Chelsea been especially impressive at home, salvaging a draw against West Bromwich Albion with a late penalty and struggling to a 2-1 win over second-bottom Crystal Palace on Saturday. Victory at Arsenal on Monday would take Chelsea at least level at the top \u2014 depending on what Liverpool do at home to Cardiff on Saturday \u2014 but the Blues enter that game in a state of uncertainty.\nMourinho has, by and large, stuck to the 4-2-3-1 formation used last season by Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Benitez. It is logical enough; the squad have been set up to play that way, with a glut of attacking midfielders, the summer influx presumably intended to combat the fatigue that Benitez\u2019s side was constantly battling towards the end of last season. And Mourinho tended to use a 4-2-3-1 at both Internazionale and Real Madrid.\nFrom the moment he arrived, though, Mourinho has been looking to play down expectations, claiming that this is not his type of squad and that this season will be one of transition. That seems to be the main reason Juan Mata has been such a peripheral figure, although he has come more into the fold recently, starting nine of the sixteen league matches this season. The implication of Mourinho\u2019s words on Tuesday, though, is that he is not merely considering a more defensive, more reactive approach \u2014 he has, after all, said that winning 1-0 is \u201cthe easiest thing you can do in football\u201d \u2014 but also a change of shape, perhaps back to the 4-3-3 he used so successfully in his first stint at the club.\nAlready this season, Chelsea have let in 18 goals in the league, three more than they conceded in the entirety of 2004-05, when they won the league in their first season under Mourinho, so there is obvious cause for concern.

That is because invasive sampling techniques, such as collecting blood or using oral swabs, require anesthesia in the field.\nUC Davis graduate student researcher Tierra Smiley Evans and the PREDICT team have now developed a noninvasive method to simplify the sampling of primates in challenging, remote locations. The method is described in a study published in June in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.\nSimple and affordable, the method opens new doors for the study of primates as sources of diseases that could affect humans in remote tropical settings.\n\u201cThis method is already being deployed in multiple countries throughout the world as part of the PREDICT project and is expanding our ability to investigate primate populations that we were previously unable to sample,\u201d said UC Davis professor Christine Kreuder Johnson, surveillance lead for the PREDICT project and senior author on the study.\nA six-inch piece of weaved rope made from nylon or cotton is dipped into an attractant such as strawberry jam. The ropes are tossed near the animals being targeted for sampling, which pick up the ropes, chew on them and drop them.\nResearchers can then collect saliva from the discarded ropes.\nThe sample is taken to a lab, where teams test it for viral diseases that may pose a direct threat to humans.\nIn this study, oral samples were collected from multiple species, including rhesus macaques in Nepal and olive baboons, red-tailed guenons and L\u2019hoest\u2019s monkeys in Uganda. A variety of viruses, including herpesviruses and simian foamy viruses, were detected in those samples.\nWild primates are prime candidates for passing diseases to humans because they are closely related to us genetically and, in many parts of the world, regularly come into contact with people.\nFor example, at sacred temples in Kathmandu, Nepal, rhesus macaques roam the temple grounds and exist among the tourists and locals who pass through the temple. Food and other items can often exchange hands. And in the remote town of Buhoma in Uganda, red-tailed guenons come down from the trees to investigate people and look for food.\nThese kinds of human-animal interfaces need monitoring most, the researchers said, because they lend themselves to the spillover of pathogens that can cause a pandemic.\nViruses that originate in wild animals account for more than 70 percent of emerging zoonotic diseases in humans, including viruses that have caused pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, epidemics such as Ebola and smaller outbreaks like Marburg hemorrhagic fever.\nThe study was funded by the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program and a William J. Fulbright Fellowship provided to Smiley Evans.\nDownload photos and read the study."}

{"idx": "1790", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Two science fiction movies go head-to-head, one starring Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, the other Gerard Butler and Andy Garcia. If you had to bet money on which would outgross the other, you'd surely put your money on Ford and Gosling, confident you'd win that bet.\nAnd that's just what happened with Blade Runner 2049 and Geostorm in North America. The Ford-Gosling starring sequel to the 1982 Ridley Scott classic earned $12.6 million on its opening day, three times as much as the $4.3 million earned in its debut by the Butler-starring Geostorm. In most territories, the former film will easily wind up outgrossing the latter.\nNow, take those same two movies and release them in China. Without making any meaningful changes to either picture, you adjust the poster for Geostorm by removing Butler and Garcia's names and images and replacing them with another actor who isn't even billed on the U.S. poster: Daniel Wu.\nChinese posters for 'Geostorm' and 'Blade Runner 2049.\nAnd voil\u00e0, with that adjustment in the marketing, you\u2019ve changed everything. When Geostorm opened on Friday against Blade Runner 2049, it outearned the more well-received Ford-Gosling picture by a margin of four-to-one, $10 million to just $2.4 million.\n'Geostorm' debuted in China on October 27, 2017.\nButler and Garcia are barely known in China, but Wu, who was born in Berkeley, California, is a big star there. The son of immigrants from Shanghai, the 43-year-old Wu grew up in California admiring Jet Li and Jackie Chan. After graduating from the University of Oregon, he moved to Hong Kong in 1997, initially to pursue a modeling career.\nOnly four months later, the Hong Kong martial arts movie director Yonfan contacted Wu after seeing his image on a bus stop advertisement and asked him to star in his upcoming film Bishonen. Despite the fact that he did not speak Cantonese, Wu performed in the picture and was on his way to a successful career as an action star.\nBased ever since in Hong Kong and mainland China, Wu has since appeared in over 60 films, including the hit Overheard movies, Go Away Mr. Tumor and Warcraft.\nWhen Geostorm director Dean Devlin cast Wu, he did so not only for the award-winning actor's on-screen talent but also for his marquee value in China, where the picture was expected to perform well given the prior success with disaster movies as The Day After Tomorrow and 2012.\nIn contrast to the cynical Hollywood casting of Chinese stars in tiny cameo roles, to which Chinese audiences often react with well-deserved sneers, casting Wu in Geostorm was a well-considered move that has paid off nicely. Though it's impossible to say how much impact Wu has had on the bottom line, it's safe to say that his presence in has been vastly more important to Geostorm's China results than Gerard Butler or any of the picture's other actors."}

The announcement made on Thursday is evidence that the love affair between France and the US actor is back on.\nAfter being questioned over his possible involvement in a Paris prostitution ring in 1998, a furious Robert De Niro told French daily Le Monde: \u201cI will never return to France\u201d. He would advise his friends against visiting the country, give back his Legion of Honour, and steer clear of the Cannes Film Festival.\nBut time heals all wounds as proved by Thursday\u2019s announcement that De Niro will serve as jury president for the 64th annual Cannes fest next May.\n\u201cThe Cannes Film Festival is a rare opportunity for me, as it is one of the oldest and one of the best in the world\u201d, the famously terse and press-shy De Niro said in a statement.\nCannes festival presidents, Gilles Jacob and Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, were even more laudatory in explaining their choice to the press.

In two of the actor\u2019s most dramatic physical transformations, De Niro packed on 60 pounds as boxer Jake La Motta in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and shed all body fat to play a chiselled psychopath in Scorsese\u2019s \u201cCape Fear\u201d.\nMore recently, De Niro has been seen in lighter, mainstream fare, including \u201cMeet the Parents\u201d \u2013 the latest instalment of which, \u201cLittle Fockers\u201d, is currently on French screens.

Ron Poore, a promotions executive at the band's label, said demand once the spot began running \"was like an avalanche.\"\nBut \"Tongue Tied\" is also one of a growing number of quirky alternative-rock tracks to cross over to pop in recent years, along with songs such as Foster the People's \"Pumped Up Kicks\" and \"Radioactive\" by Imagine Dragons.\n\"In the early 2000s alternative was not creating hits,\" said Lisa Worden, music director at L.A.'s KROQ-FM (106.7). \"Now the format's hot again.\"\nAnd you can hear Zucconi's claim borne out to some degree on Grouplove's new album, \"Spreading Rumours.\" Due Tuesday, it's noisier and trippier than the band's debut, with unexpected stabs of electronic fuzz like those in \"Hippy Hill,\" where the singer makes a kind of pledge of countercultural allegiance, singing \"I'd rather be a hippie than a hipster.\"\nStill, there"}

As the day of the fight approaches, Beard is satisfied with Vijender's training. Beard also said that the Indian's training session is increasing by the day.

We have run a few tests on him and he looks in good shape for the fight.\"\nCommenting on Amuzu, Beard said, \"You know Ernest Amuzu has got a good record, and he is strong fighter who has played a lot of fights but Vijender is an amazing boxer and always focused on the strategies planned by us. Vijender has boxed off many tough fighters who have had different style of boxing, but southpaw is bit more difficult to fight and he has fought less opponents of southpaw.\n\"But he is good at every technical style boxing. This is a fight which he should be able to control easily enough with his jabbing and boxing abilities, it's just he's been in the ring many times with fighters similar to Amuzu, so this should not oppose to many difficulties to adjust from southpaw to orthodox because he has done too many times in his career over the years,\" asserted Beard.\n\"Vijender is much more gifted than Amuzu, it's not about what Amuzu is going bring for him, he just has to put a good show and perform his best when gets in that ring that'll be enough for him.

They share their knowledge about preventing injury, activities in the valley and competition and often form relationships with clients that last for years.\nNow, a group of local pros is trying to apply that teaching model throughout the year. Pros in Motion, a business based in the Roaring Fork Valley, contracts ski and snowboard pros to give clients that all-around experience while they\u2019re recreating in other sports, particularly cycling.\nPros in Motion works with everyone from kids and older athletes just learning how to ride a bike to more advanced cyclists who want to explore the valley.\nPros in Motion was created almost by accident when Kasin started riding with his ski clients. Kasin was racing bikes at the highest level for amateurs when he had a heart attack at age 41. After recovering, Kasin was still training, albeit not at the same level.\nThat person has become one of Kasin\u2019s favorite ski clients, he said.\nKasin has since formalized the program, booking clients with pros who match their skill sets and availability. Pros in Motion operates independently, but it partners with the Viceroy in Snowmass Village and The Little Nell and the Limelight in Aspen, running cycling adventures out of the hotels.\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019re training our pros, we\u2019re choosing our pros based on a common set of goals and a way of approaching the guest and treating the guest,\u201d Kasin said.\nDaRosa rode with a family from New York City that was in town right before the start of the USA Pro Challenge.

All the pros are CPR and AED certified, and some have had some first-responder or mountain-rescue training.\nKasin wants to give locals and others who haven\u2019t ridden with the group yet a chance to participate with a four-day event later this month. One day each will be dedicated to leading people over the Pro Challenge Stage 1 route and up and down Independence Pass. The pros will lead groups on a tour of the Roaring Fork Valley another day and a double stage of the Maroon Bells and Castle Creek Road on the last day.\nKasin is planning the tour for the weekend of Sept. 22 and 23.

A day later, CBS created an \u201call access\u201d $5.99 a month subscription to its website and mobile apps featuring live streams of local stations, as well as full seasons of current shows, which will be available the day after they are aired, and an archive of classic content such as Star Trek and Cheers.\nBut where will individual subscription options, which are known as \u201cover the top\u201dplans, lead the industry \u2014and consumers? Currently, the quintessential over the top subscription plan is Netflix\u2019s streaming service. For a monthly fee, consumers access Netflix\u2019s original content, such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, as well as an extensive library of licensed movie and television content. Netflix\u2019s has focused its marketing and growth efforts on Internet streaming, though the company also offers DVDs or Blu-ray discs by mail.\nShortly after Richard Plepler, CEO of HBO, announced the channel\u2019s Internet subscription effort, questions and speculation emerged about the economics of the plan. Plepler called the service \u201ctransformative,\u201d but neglected to mention many details.\nThe Wall Street Journal later reported that HBO would price its service at no less than what it costs cable subscribers \u2014 roughly $15. The goal for HBO would be to keep so-called cord cutters\u2014those with only a broadband connection and no cable TV\u2014in the fold. HBO could also offer its Internet subscription with cable broadband partners as a package. FBR analyst Barton Crockett said in a research note that if HBO could convince four million people to pay $15 a month for the Internet-only service it could generate $500 million in incremental revenue a year.\nThe plan announced by CBS included more details, yet analysts questioned its appeal. CBS will charge $5.99 a month and subscriptions will be available on Internet connected devices. Geotargeting will enable news stations to keep streams local. The catch is that new CBS content, unlike that of HBO, not to mention over the air for consumers with a digital receiver or converter box, said Gabelli analyst Brett Harriss.\nAnalysts called the CBS service the network\u2019s own version Hulu Plus and noted that the Internet subscription is more of an insurance policy in case viewers move away from cable bundles more quickly than expected.\nThe move to stand-alone subscription plans simply reflects the competitive dynamics of today\u2019s TV landscape. CBS\u2019 move or HBO\u2019s could spur other broadcast and cable networks to offer their own subscription plans. If all media companies created their own subscriptions, the current system of bundling channels into a single cable subscription could be in trouble: Why would cable companies pay fees to networks when their content is no longer exclusive?\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin questioned CBS\u2019 math. \u201cWe don\u2019t get it. For every household that subscribes to the new CBS service outside the TV bundle for $6/month and turns off the TV bundle, CBS loses $1.50/month and the rest of the TV content companies lose $40/month,\u201d said Martin. Those figures are her estimate of what cable companies pay content owners each month. The risk is that CBS destabilizes the bundle system and loses money, she added.\nBundles will likely continue to exist, explains Werbach."}

{"idx": "1836", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Microsoft recently unveiled the Nokia 215, a smarter \"dumbphone\" that will launch for just $29 in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe in the first quarter of 2015. Although the Series 30 phone is powered by bottom-end hardware, it comes loaded with Web apps like Facebook , Facebook Messenger, Twitter , Opera, Bing Search, and MSN Weather.\nAccording to Microsoft&apos;s announcement at CES, the Nokia 215 will come in single and dual-SIM versions, have a talk time of 20 hours, play MP3s for up to 50 hours, and last 29 days on standby. Microsoft didn&apos;t disclose how long the 215 lasts for 3G browsing or video playback.\nThe Nokia 215 might not initially seem like a major device for Microsoft, but it actually reveals a lot about its long-term mobile strategies.\nWhy the Nokia 215 mattersPeople often forget that Nokia&apos;s handset division, which Microsoft acquired last year, remains the second-largest cell phone manufacturer in the world after Samsung. However, most of the division&apos;s sales were generated by Nokia&apos;s low-end feature phones instead of Lumia Windows Phones (which Microsoft rebranded as its own last year).\nLast year, Microsoft discontinued its Nokia X Android phone and the low-end Asha Series 40 smartphones to clear the way for lower-end Windows Phones to enter emerging markets. While many people believed that Nokia-branded feature phones would also be discontinued, Microsoft kept the business alive and launched the $25 Nokia 130 last September.\nHowever, the Nokia 130 was as spartan as a phone could be -- it lacked a camera or 3G connectivity, and its only \"extra\" features were a Bluetooth antenna, an FM radio, a media player, and a microSD card slot. The 130 might generate a little extra pocket change for Microsoft, but it didn&apos;t fit into the company&apos;s low-end Windows Phone strategy of tethering more users to its mobile ecosystem.\nTherefore, selling the Nokia 215 for just $29 represents a way for Microsoft to wean more \"dumbphone\" users onto \"smarter\" feature phones with Web connectivity. Microsoft likely hopes that getting users hooked on Facebook, Twitter, Bing, and MSN apps can encourage them to eventually upgrade to low-end Windows Phones.\nThe shrinking business of feature phonesBetween the third quarters of 2013 and 2014, Microsoft Mobile (Nokia)&apos;s global handset shipments fell 23% from 64.6 million units to 49.8 million units, according to Counterpoint Research. That decline will likely accelerate as lower cost smartphones render feature phones obsolete. In 2013, Gartner reported that smartphones outsold feature phones globally for the first time in history.\nFeature phone shipments are declining, but their margins are surprisingly decent. IHS iSuppli estimates that the Nokia 105, which launched for $20 in 2013, was sold with a hardware and manufacturing margin of 29%. Therefore, it makes sense for Microsoft to milk those profits before the feature phone market completely dries up.\nLeaping from platform to platformHowever, it would be foolish to let"}

Those beacons are tuned to pedestrian traffic so passersby receive mobile messages when they\u2019re in the right place.\nAnd the beacons drive results.\nAlmost half (48%) of those with the Regent Street app use it more than twice a month, according to Henry Lawson, CEO of AutoGraph, the company that deployed and runs the Regent Street beaconing program for the association.\nRegent Street stores are getting a 10-times uplift in offer redemption from beaconing and 63% are using the app to plan visits to restaurants, according to Lawson.\nBut over time, the actual standalone beacon is becoming embedded in other things, from Wi-Fi access points in large stores to lighting.\nAs a result, the location data from beaconing is becoming more integrated with other location data, such as from GPS signals and Wi-Fi.\nAs yet another example of beacons integrating with other aspects of commerce, the platform of Boston-based Swirl just became integrated with Oracle so that personalized marketing, via beacons, can occur in a more integrated fashion.\nThe idea is that in-store shopper behavioral data can be used to target and deliver personalized content with Oracle Marketing Cloud.\nThe Swirl platform leverages digital location signals from beacons, GPS and Wi-Fi to generate first-party data for different marketing channels.\nThe initial thought for many installing beacons was that in-store shoppers could be sent messages as they neared certain products.\nThe reality is that beacons can do so much more.\nSince they awaken specific mobile apps on a phone, they can be used to gather customer feedback via surveys after a customer leaves a store. They also can be used for retargeting shoppers later with personalized emails or online ads, as well as being able to check the effectiveness of paid media in driving store traffic.\nIn addition to being the place where most shoppers buy the most, physical stores now become a key asset in cross-channel marketing.

Billy Pulsipher took the mound for the New York Mets in 1995, riding a wave of confidence, but injuries and depression would take a toll on his career soon after.\n\"Injuries can certainly alter your career,\" said Bill Pulsipher's father, William. \"Some pitchers come back from them earlier than others.\"\nIn the spring of 1996 Pulsipher blew out his elbow. After the surgery, the Mets sent him back to the minor leagues for rehabilitation. It took Pulsipher a few years to get back in shape for the Major League. He was traded to Milwaukee, where he pitched for almost two years before being traded back to the Mets. A year later, in 2001, Pulsipher spent time playing in Boston and in Chicago with the White Socks, but setbacks caused by injuries and depression forced the left-handed pitcher to quit the game for some time. Instead of playing baseball, Pulsipher found himself mowing the fields in Florida. The love of the game saw him return to baseball, where he played in minor leagues for a few years.\nAfter bouncing around the minor leagues, Pulsipher finally found his rhythm again. The long and winding road took him to St. Louis, where in 2005 he was the relief pitcher for the Cardinals.\n\"He was very excited last year after he made the Cardinals,\" said his father, William Pulsipher.\nPulsipher was drafted into the majors straight from high school. In 1991, the New York Mets drafted the pitcher in the second round of the amateur draft, 66th pick overall.\n\"He's the best pitcher we've had at Fairfax. He went pretty much where we expected [in the draft],\" said Tom Verbanic, the Fairfax baseball coach at the time, after Pulsipher was picked in 1991.\nThe 17-year-old hurler was excited about the prospect of playing for the Mets organization. \"Being picked by the Mets was just great. They have the best pitching staff in baseball and in the minor leagues they really develop you. They have a reputation of taking care of their players,\" said Pulsipher after the draft (Fairfax Connection, 1991).\nHE GAVE UP a full scholarship to Old Dominion University in order to sign with the Mets. While in high school, the left hander was contacted by every one of the 26 Major League teams. His father said it was not difficult for Pulsipher to make the decision to go to the pros instead of college. He said teams made lucrative offers, and promised to secure Pulsipher's education as well.\nThe four-time All-Potomac District selectee led the Rebels to a 17-4 record his senior season. He recorded a 9-2 season on the mound, with a 1.36 earned run average and a school record 126 strikeouts. The hurler also delivered offensively, batting at .429, hitting five home runs and 31 RBI's.

They also want the board of directors to replace a number of other people on the management team who have contributed to the restaurant's lackluster performance and the destruction of the brand's value.\nThe dustup, which follows a no-confidence vote at the National Jack in the Box Franchisee Association (NFA) annual meeting this past July, has attracted the attention of activist investor Jana Partners, which established a 7.3% stake in Jack in the Box earlier this year. The hedge fund has sided with the franchisees, telling Bloomberg, \"We share the franchisees' concerns about Jack in the Box's performance and the lack of urgency in addressing it.\"\nAlthough revenue was down 23% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, to $188 million, that's more a function of the refranchising underway at the chain. Refranchising is the sale of company-owned stores to franchisees. Of the 2,241 stores in the Jack in the Box system, 94% are franchisee-owned. The company sold 127 restaurants to franchisees in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 and expected to sell eight more in the fourth quarter, completing the refranchising program.\nOne of the main problems for Jack in the Box has been poor product development, which has led to few return trips to the restaurants. Comparable-store sales returned to positive territory in the third quarter, but rose just 0.5%. In comparison, McDonald's has reported comp sales growth for 12 quarters in a row, while Wendy's has seen same-restaurant sales rise for 22 consecutive quarters.\nIn particular, franchisees cite poor performance with Jack in the Box's Food Truck sandwiches, Pork Belly BLTs, and Smoky Jack burgers. The NFA says these product missteps have caused Jack in the Box restaurants to fall \"way behind\" on their goal of achieving average unit volumes of $2 million by 2020.\nJack in the Box has been one of the worst-performing stocks among quick-serve chains this year, with the stock down 16% in 2018.\nJack in the Box Relative Stock Performance, data by YCharts.\nThe NFA says that it has attempted to relay the concerns of its membership to Jack in the Box's management, but that the company has refused to engage on its requests and suggestions for improvement.

Intel will make the move either using its next-generation manufacturing process, which can create circuitry with 90-nanometer features, or using the 65-nanometer generation after that, Fister said.\nSo far, only IBM sells servers with these \"dual-core\" chips, but Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are working on their own designs, expected as soon as next year. Intel's Itanium, a brand-new design requiring different software than that used with its Pentium and Xeon chips, is designed to compete with these server chips. The 64-bit chip is used mainly in high-end servers that typically run four or more processors.\nDual-core designs could help Intel lower Itanium's price tag enough so that it becomes appropriate for cost-conscious markets, where server sales are currently high, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood.\n\"Right now, Itanium is stuck in a relatively low-volume niche. The challenge for Intel is how to migrate Itanium down into all but maybe the $2,000-to-$3,000 price bands,\" Brookwood said. \"A dual-core chip could help them do that.\"\nWith each new manufacturing-process generation, circuitry becomes smaller, and more tiny computing switches, called transistors, can be fitted on a single silicon chip. Chip designers face the job of finding the best use for all the new transistors at their disposal, and building dual-core processors is one route.\nThe bigger the processor, the later the transition to dual-core chips can be made. Itanium, at about 400 to 450 square millimeters in size, \"is about as big a chip as anybody's ever manufactured,\" Brookwood said. Itanium 2 currently is built on a 180-nanometer process, but the third-generation \"Madison\" chip will be built on a 130-nanometer process and thus will shrink to about 200 to 300 square millimeters, Brookwood said.\nWith 90-nanometer manufacturing, an Itanium would be about 150 square millimeters, Brookwood said, so a dual-core Itanium would be roughly 300 square millimeters, a practical size.\nMadison is scheduled to arrive in the summer of 2003, said Mike Graf, product line manager for Itanium.\nIn branding strategy, Intel will re-use the Itanium 2 name for Madison, though with some variation so it can be distinguished from the current \"McKinley\" generation. Intel decided to use the same name because Madison chips can be plugged into the exact same computers that use today's Itanium 2 systems, he said.\nIntel is preparing a lower-end Itanium 2 as well, code-named Deer"}

Most sufferers of glandular disorders are women, although it's not clear why.\nSYMPTOMS: Irregular or absent periods, reduced fertility or recurrent miscarriage, excessive bodily and facial hair, thinning hair on the scalp, rapid weight gain and a difficulty in losing weight, depression, mood swings, oily skin and acne.\nCAUSES: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 8 per cent of premenopausal women. It is caused by the ovaries producing irregular amounts of various hormones, including the follicle-stimulating hormone (too little prevents a woman from ovulating, causing infertility). Many women with this condition are also resistant to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar - and, as a result, they also have too much of the male hormones such as testosterone. Another problem is ovarian cysts.\nTREATMENT: The drug metformin can improve the body's sensitivity to insulin and regulates periods. The contraceptive Pill can regulate periods and help with acne and excess hair. Sometimes surgery will be performed to reduce the number of ovarian cysts. Women who wish to have a family will be offered fertility treatment. Being overweight increases the symptoms, so exercise and a careful diet can also help.\nMY STORY: Lorraine Branch, 34, a PR manager, is single and lives in Wimbledon, London. She says: I'd been on the Pill since 13 because I suffered from painful and heavy periods that lasted six weeks. Unfortunately, while the Pill helped with this, it also masked the symptoms of PCOS, and it wasn't until I was 20 and wanted to try for a baby with my then partner that the problem emerged. Within a couple of weeks of coming off the Pill, I had acne and hair had sprouted onmy stomach, feet, chin and upper lip.\nAfter a year, I still had not conceived so I saw a gynaecologist, who diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome. I was upset because I wanted a family, but I was also focused on getting rid of the hair and acne. I have been on different versions of the Pill ever since.

The director actually requested the sponsors, claiming that if the park were opened today, every part of it would be branded.\nThe final battle of the second Avengers movie is set in the fictional Sokovia, but it was filmed at a London police training college. The statue in the town square was given a fake beard for the movie (to resemble an Eastern European figure?) - a necessary move for British audiences, since the statue is a well-known monument to Robert Peel, the inventor of the modern police force, and the reason British cops are still called \"bobbies\" to this day.\nThe director of Furious Seven, James Wan confused everyone when he explained that the \"seven\" in the movie's title was meant to be the actual word, not the number of the movie's place in the series. Why? Apparently the movie's title is actually a tribute to the classic Japanese movie Seven Samurai, with Wan seeing Dominic Toretto and his team of racers as Hollywood's modern - horsepowered - Samurai.\nThe secret NASA mission to save a stranded astronaut in The Martian is given the title \"Project Elrond,\" a reference to a secret meeting in The Lord of the Rings' first chapter, Fellowship of The Ring.

It seemed even more clear this morning, when Jeff Zeleny over at the New York Times quoted Rand Paul saying that if elected, he would support Mitch McConnell's leadership in the Senate. \"I don't see myself going up there and being the one fly in the ointment,\" he said.\nOf course, one of Paul's most passionate convictions is for term limits. Since the Supreme Court found them unconstitutional and Paul is so passionate a devotee to the Constitution that he wants to pass a law ordering Congress to cite a Constitutional justification for every law they pass \u2014 except that one, of course \u2014 he wants Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment mandating an elected official's shorter time in office. In other words, Rand Paul loves the Constitution so much that he wants to change it. But this poses a slight problem: Mitch McConnell has been a Senator since 1984. So Paul would have to support him while also trying to overthrow him.\nAlso, as many have pointed out in the past, term limits often mean that our legislators don't know what they're talking about, thus giving even more power to the lobbyists and the bureaucracy.\nThe pursuit of purity is always a dangerous thing, whether it's prohibition or Mao's Great Leap Forward. But the deep confusion that has overtaken even the smartest Republicans seems impervious to logic. Consider the case of Ross Douthat, the latest Times' candidate for the \"intelligent conservative\" slot once held by William Safire. On Monday, he wrote an attention-grabbing column called \"The Great Consolidation.\" \"From Washington to Athens,\" he wrote, \"the economic crisis is producing consolidation rather than revolution, the entrenchment of authority rather than its diffusion, and the concentration of power in the hands of the same elite that presided over the disasters in the first place.\"\nIn Greece, for example, the European Union put in strict rules and deficit-reduction demands in exchange for a trillion-dollar bailout. As Douthat put it (without mentioning the deficit-reduction part): \"A crisis created by hasty, elite-driven integration will have led, inexorably, to further integration and a more powerful elite.\"\nThis is the perverse logic of meritocracy. Once a system grows sufficiently complex, it doesn't matter how badly our best and brightest foul things up. Every crisis increases their authority, because they seem to be the only ones who understand the system well enough to fix it.\nTo which you can only say: well, duh. It's all very pleasant and American to rail against elites, but nobody wants Joe the Plumber in charge of the economy. He'd still be trying to figure out the difference between M1 and M2 as all our M turned into pocket change. Most of us also prefer doctors who have been to medical school and nuclear plant operators who are not Homer Simpson. This is why the very best that the Tea Party's new \"Contract from America\" will achieve \u2014 on today's primary day or any other \u2014 is exactly what the old \"Contract with America\" achieved: minor, temporary reductions... and the increasing bitterness of fools who got fooled again."}

So many retailers expanded beyond the number of doors they truly needed to serve their customer or began to rely on a heavy amount of promotional activity to drive traffic and that has not proven to be a beneficial long-term strategy.\nWWD: With the rise of brands going direct-to-consumer, how does traditional wholesale and brick-and-mortar need to change or reinvent?\nA.W.: Traditional wholesalers need to give serious thought to the long-term health of their brand and not grow and flood the market with more product than the customers are asking for at full price.

Sourcery then takes those invoices and organizes them by each line item. The benefit is that, as Partensky says above, restaurants can gain insights into their purchasing habits. For instance, if a restaurant wanted to know how much it's been spending on cauliflower, it can pull that information up vs going through scores of invoices and typing those purchases manually into a spreadsheet. By sending them to Sourcery to scan and upload, that data input time is saved. Or if expenses start going up, a restaurant can identify the source of rising costs faster by looking up line items that are rising each day or month.\n\"Once an invoice comes in, we use technology and human verification to input the date, total amount, and each line item,\" Moran explained. \"This enables you [the restaurant] to categorize each item [by vendor, by ingredient, by date, etc.].\"\nThe sweet spot for Sourcery is restaurant groups with more than five locations, \"because at that scale you need process automation to survive,\" said Moran. Sourcery's customers range from restaurants, such as Austin, Texas-based Snap Kitchen, and fast-growing tech companies, such as Thumbtack, Dropbox, and Airbnb. They pay a subscription fee based on the number of invoices they process. Small businesses are priced at $299 a month whereas a large business is charged $5,000 to upwards of $10,000 a month. Those are businesses processing thousands of invoices a month.\nSo why would restaurants pay this amount? \"The ROI analysis involves how much time they're spending on manual data entry today,\" said Moran. \"With larger customers, there's also an added component of us providing line-item level [transparency] about price fluctuations.\" For instance, by being able to analyze the costs of each ingredient or line item, a customer can see which prices are rising, enabling them to make cost-saving purchasing decisions.\nIn addition, Sourcery helps its customers pay those invoices online, making Sourcery a de facto payment processor - a path the company didn't originally set out to be on [more on that below].\nBut the payment feature has given Sourcery another value-added service in its toolbox.

IDC finds that the banking, discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, federal/central government, and professional services will account for about 50% of all spending in this market during this time.\nHowever, industries such as telecommunications, insurance, transportation, and utilities will start increasing their own spending during this same period, helping to fuel growth.\nFor IT, especially those working in banking and financial services, this is a critical time, considering that most of the investment will be made by IT professionals, administrators, and CIOs, as well as by the company's business services division. Some of the biggest spending -- about $60 billion -- will go toward software such as reporting and analysis tools, as well as data warehouse management systems. Hardware investment will reach nearly $30 billion by 2020.\nThe IDC report found numerous reasons why certain industries are investing in big data and business analytics. In the banking field, these investments will focus mainly on security- and compliance-related issues. For others, there's a focus on getting more information from the customer, while improving that experience.\n\"Within banking, many of these efforts are focused on risk management, fraud prevention and compliance related activities,\" Jessica Goepfert, IDC's program director for customer insights and analysis, wrote in a statement.\n\"The customer experience is at the heart of the telecommunication industry's BDA investments; for instance, BDA technologies are being deployed in call centers to enable representatives to delight callers with superior service.\"\nWhile the IDC data reports a fairly robust picture of big data and analytics spending over the next four years, an Oct. 4 report by Gartner paints a slightly different picture.\nGartner's survey of 199 members of its online community of IT and business leaders finds that, while some firms are investing in big data, many remain in the pilot stage. This situation could cause investment to slow.\nAbout 48% of respondents say they plan to invest in big data this year -- an increase of 3% compared to 2015. However, those indicating they plan to invest in the technology within the next two years fell from 31% to 25% in 2016.\nInstead, enterprises are putting their cash to use on other IT initiatives to build up their infrastructure, especially since the immediate return on investment from big data is hard to calculate.\n\"This could be due to the fact that many big data projects don't have a tangible return on investment (ROI) that can be determined upfront,\" Nick Heudecker, research director with Gartner, wrote in"}

The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has allowed the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST), provider of electricity in Mumbai, to extend its existing power purchase agreement (PPA) with Tata Power.\nThe current agreement for 677 megawatts expires in March this year. The extension lets the company supply the stipulated power for another five years, providing earnings visibility.\nThe agreement will let Tata Power continue to derive an annual profit of about \u20b9 150 crore, amounting to 11% of FY18 standalone profit, show calculations by analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd. \u201cAs per the latest tariff order Tata Power\u2019s Mumbai-based power generation capacity is entitled to earn ~ \u20b9 3billion/year of profit on approved regulated equity of ~ \u20b9 20billion at 15.5% return on equity,\" the brokerage firm said in a note. \u201cAround 50% of the capacity is currently sold to BEST and the balance is sold to the distribution entity of Tata Power for the Mumbai distribution area. With the extension of the PPA with BEST the risk of the ~ \u20b9 1.5-1.75billion on consolidated profit is behind Tata Power and provides earnings visibility for the next five years.\"\nStill the development did not lead to earnings upgrades as most analysts were expecting BEST to continue the PPA. \u201cWhile we were already factoring in the continuation of the PPA, the development removes uncertainty,\" said Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Even so, as the muted reaction in the stock suggests, investors are awaiting bigger triggers before they consider any rerating.\nOne is the relief from the loss-making Mundra ultra-mega power plant, which is in the works. Second is balance-sheet deleveraging, which the company has promised and is pursuing. Positive developments on this over the last year notwithstanding, the Tata Power stock trailed the broader market.\nThe underperformance underscores investor concerns about the timing and the quantum of relief for the Mundra plant. The relief is contingent on five states consenting to tariff ratifications. While Gujarat has agreed to provide relief, other buyers (states) are yet to provide their consent. Also it is not clear if the states will ratify the tariff agreement before or after the general election.\n\u201cThe big challenge is how Mundra power plant issue will get resolved,\" says an analyst with a domestic broking firm. \u201cIf the resolution is going to happen after the general election, I would rather wait before getting constructive on the stock.\""}

Board member Kelly Gonez, who gave birth to a boy last weekend, was absent for the vote. The four make up a bloc of charter school allies who effectively control the seven-member board.\nThe pro-parcel tax group led by board member George McKenna was seeking approval for a flat tax on individual properties, with exemptions for people 65 and older and those with very little income. The size of the tax was up for debate, provided that it was high enough to significantly reduce the district\u2019s projected deficit. Board members Richard Vladovic and Scott Schmerelson also supported the measure.\nSupporters of the November timeline said that waiting two years to put the measure before voters could force board members into a politically risky situation. Several of them are expected to be running for reelection in 2020 at the same time that they might be asking voters to raise taxes.\nCharter school advocates, several of whom spoke at the board meeting, said they would not support a ballot measure that increased funding only for L.A. Unified but not for the more-than 200 charter schools within its boundaries.\nSupt. Austin Beutner said he opposed the November timeline.

But in the winter, with a ban on ice fishing and no less than a mile hike to get to the pond, the water body \u2014 located between Saranac Lake and Bloomingdale \u2014 is largely abandoned.\nOn Super Bowl Sunday, my buddy Jason Labonte and I decided to head out early in the morning to ski to the pond from its state Route 3 trailhead. We were pleased to find that the trail had been skied on a couple days prior, and with a couple fresh inches of snow, the conditions were perfect.\nWith headlamps lighting the trail (we started out at 5 a.m.), we made the easy ski of about a mile and a quarter out to the pond, bearing right at the fork in the trail at just over a mile. We skied down to the edge of the pond to a rock outcrop that makes for an excellent swimming platform in the summer.\nWith no ice fishing and limited reason for people to venture out on the ice, we had no idea if conditions were safe ahead of time. But with recent cold spells, it made sense that the ice would be thick enough to hold us, especially with skis on. Jason and I gave the ice a check and decided to keep skiing, although we stayed close enough to shore that if the ice did give way we would be close to land.\nSkiing along the western shore, we continued north on the pond and before dawn we had reached the far end, where the state boat launch is located. Moose Pond Road, which leads to the launch is closed seasonally, but there were some snowshoe tracks at the parking area.\nJason and I, still in complete darkness, eyed the steep launch and were soon taking short powder runs down the slope and out onto the ice. It wasn\u2019t Whiteface, but earning turns \u2014 no matter how few or short \u2014 is always a pleasure. Plus, we wanted to kill some time so we could ski out in the daylight.\nAs the sky began to lighten, we made our way to a little island east of the boat launch. A small slope offered another place to ski downhill, and although I\u2019m not a bad skier, a steeper than expected drop off at the edge of the island put me on my face with skis in the air. After laughing at me, we decided to head back past the boat launch and roughly follow our path out.\nBut that didn\u2019t happen, as we climbed a rock outcrop near the launch and noticed the large chimney in the woods. The chimney and part of a foundation are part of an old resort that existed prior to the state buying the rest of the shoreline in 1965 (the entirety of the shore is now owned by the state). According to an Enterprise article from 1925, the resort was called Bel-Lago.

The global Brent crude contract for July was down $1, or 1.6%, at $63.64 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.\n\"The fact remains that supply is continuing to outstrip demand,\" analyst Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute said in a note. \"It is very difficult to see how the massive oversupply situation is going to reverse in the short to medium term.\"\nGlobally, analysts said Saudi Arabia was talking of increasing production and Libya could also soon raise output, while Iraq is pumping at near-record levels, contributing to swelling supplies. Talks to resolve a diplomatic stalemate with Iran were continuing, leading up to a June 30 deadline, with the potential to eventually release at least another 500,000 barrels a day onto world markets. Analysts say global supplies continue to mount at a rate of around 2 million barrels a day.\nIn the U.S., a closely watched but loose gauge of production, the number of rigs deployed to drill for oil, fell for the 27th consecutive week and is now 60% below year-ago levels. But the U.S. Energy Information Administration&apos;s estimate of production continues to rise, edging up 24,000 barrels last week to 9.6 million barrels a day---nearly 14% higher than a year ago and the highest level in more than four decades.\nOil benchmarks have rallied off their lows set in late March, but the recovery has lost steam, with prices trading in a narrow range around $60 a barrel since early May. Prices are up nearly 40% from their low set earlier this year but a far cry from the $100-a-barrel range that dominated for the past several years. Though financial investors remain positioned for a rising market overall, regulatory data shows they edged back from bullish positions in both contracts by 3% or more last week.\nMeanwhile, the dollar strengthened as concerns about Greek solvency carried on.

{"idx": "1881", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Over the past few years, Facebook has evolved into one of Alphabet &apos;s most dangerous rivals. Facebook is currently the second most popular website in the world after Alphabet&apos;s Google, according to site tracker Alexa, with over a billion daily active users. That massive user base is helping Facebook expand its ecosystem deep into Google&apos;s backyard.\nOver the past 12 months, investors have aggressively bought both stocks. Facebook shares have rallied 30% while Alphabet&apos;s shares are up more than 40%. But looking ahead into 2016, Facebook&apos;s weed-like growth could throttle Alphabet&apos;s long-term expansion plans. Let&apos;s take a closer look at three main ways Facebook could hurt Alphabet -- social media dominance, monolithic messaging, and video streaming.\nSocial media dominanceGoogle is the world&apos;s top search engine, but every attempt to tether those users into a social network has failed. Last year, Stone Temple Consulting estimated that only 10% of Google accounts, or about 250 million users, have ever publicly posted anything on Google+. Within that total, pseudonymous tech blogger Edward Morbius suggested that just four to six million users can actually be considered \"active.\"\nGoogle neither confirmed nor countered those figures, but the split between Stream and Photos in March and a soft reboot of Google+ in November suggests that it&apos;s struggling.Instead of competing head-to-head with Facebook, the \"new\" Google+ imitates features from Reddit and Pinterest with Communities and Collections, but it could be tough to tear users away from those deeply entrenched social sites.\nFacebook finished last quarter with 1.55 billion monthly active users. To diversify the appeal of its social empire, it added Twitter-like features like hashtags, live streaming video, and curated moments. It also introduced \"Facebook at Work\" to challenge LinkedIn and tested ephemeral messages to counter Snapchat. Meanwhile, Facebook&apos;s Instagram has evolved into a stand-alone beast with 400 million active users as of last September. The more time users spend on Facebook and Instagram, the less time they&apos;ll spend within Google&apos;s ecosystem. This paradigm shift could throttle the amount of data Google mines and undermine the effectiveness of its targeted ads.\nMonolithic messagingFacebook has two messaging apps -- WhatsApp, which has 900 million active users, and Messenger, which has over700 million. WhatsApp is ideal for no-frills messaging, while Messenger serves as a foundation for add-on services. Facebook has already added apps, games, customer relationship tools for businesses, mobile payment options, andUber integration to Messenger. These features can help Messenger become a monolithic \"all in one\" app like Tencent&apos;s WeChat and Naver&apos;s LINE -- which are both wildly popular across Asia.\nFor example, the booming O2O (online to offline) market in China -- which funnels games, e-commerce sites, taxi services, and other services into single chat apps like WeChat -- grewnearly 43% annually in 2014, according to iResearch. Facebook Messenger could similarly pull other apps into its orbit worldwide, which would cut Google out of the mobile loop.\nGoogle previously launched mobile messaging apps like Google Talk, Google Voice, Google Hangouts, and Messenger. Each of these apps integrated SMS and MMS messages"}

Advent is planning his $1.3 billion resort between the Desert Inn and the Venetian hotel-casino.\nSan Francisco real estate investor Luke Brugnara is developing plans for a resort replicating his hometown at the site of the Silver City Casino.\nAnd earlier this month, real estate magnate Phil Ruffin announced he too has plans for a San Francisco-themed resort. Ruffin intends to raze the New Frontier and replace it with City by the Bay.\nThose who believe San Franciscans -- perceived to be snobbish by some -- might be disgusted by a replication will be surprised to learn San Francisco natives are hardly bothered by the proposals.\n\"Copying is the ultimate form of flattery; San Francisco should be all over the world,\" said Angela Alioto, a San Francisco attorney whose family plays a huge role in the city's heritage.\nLongtime city folks, however, do have one request: If the resorts are going to be built, they had better be done right.\nArt Hoppe, a 40-year humor columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, offered some suggestions for developers who plan to duplicate his beloved city. Topping the list was: scratch the idea of naming one Frisco Bay. Frisco is a nickname frowned on by natives of a city referred to in the local newspapers as The City.\n\"Holy Criminy,\" a disgusted Hoppe said after learning of Advent's plan. \"Oh my gosh, people would hate that here. Nobody from San Francisco would be caught dead in Frisco Bay.\"\nHoppe warmed up to the idea of a theme resort when he learned of Ruffin's plan to call his City by the Bay.\nResorts proposed by Advent and Ruffin are expected to accommodate key landmarks like the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz, Lombard Street, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThose are fine tourist attractions, Hoppe said, but how about representing the real San Francisco?\n\"They should probably have an earthquake every week,\" Hoppe said. \"Shake up the guests a little.\n\"And don't forget the Critical Mass bicycle rides,\" he continued, referring to a monthly event in which hundreds of bicyclists ride along the city's thoroughfares to promote the use of bicycles rather than vehicles. Critical Mass bicyclists have been known to tie up traffic during rush hour, infuriating commuters.\n\"They should also have a lot of homeless, gays and protesters,\" Hoppe concluded.\nAt a time when air travel is affordable, more and more cities are competing for tourism. But San Francisco officials aren't overly concerned that Las Vegas will steal tourists by using their own city as a draw.\n\"Of course there can never be another place like San Francisco,\" Mayor Brown said. \"If someone were trying to replicate San Francisco's many attractions and landmarks, they'd be hard-pressed"}

The steps below will help protect you as the seller or buyer of a vehicle from a private party.\nWhen you sell a vehicle, you (owner/seller) are responsible for filing the \u201cNotice of Sale\u201d within 10 days of the sale. This is located in the lower portion of the Certificate of Title. Doing this in a timely manner protects you and helps law enforcement to have access to the most current registered owner information. It is also helpful to create a receipt that contains the buyer\u2019s contact information and date of sale. This will serve as proof of when you sold the vehicle and to whom.\nWhen purchasing a vehicle from a private party it is important that the vehicle title is transferred as soon as possible. Minnesota state law says that you have to transfer the vehicle\u2019s title within 10 days of the date of sale, other than a sale by or to a licensed motor vehicle dealer.\nNew residents have a 60-day grace period in which to register their cars, passenger vans, 3/4 ton or less pickups, motorcycles, utility trailers, or house trailers as long as the displayed license plates are current.

However, if any further proof was needed of the west\u2019s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest cities has been all too telling.\nThe drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality\u2019s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street.\nTheir vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space.\nThe long-term aim, beyond greening the city, is to encourage people to use car-sharing schemes, if they really need a vehicle, or switch to public transport and bicycles. Globally, most cars are said to be parked 95% of the time.\nDresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear.\n\u201cI was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,\u201d he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. \u201cIf I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ...

If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem.\nDresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some.

Instead, the Angels were left gawking at a tragicomic bottom of the eighth inning that led to an 8-6 loss in a game they thought they had in the bag. Justin Anderson and Osmer Morales, the Angels\u2019 seventh and eighth pitchers of a planned bullpen game combined to allow four runs.\nDespite the late meltdown, given that it was a mid-August game between non-contending teams, the play that will be remembered the longest will surely be the bases-loaded one-hopper Angels second baseman David Fletcher hit to Rangers third baseman Jurickson Profar in the fifth inning, with the Angels ahead 6-3. Profar stepped on third base for a forceout, tagged Taylor Ward as he stumbled off third base and then threw to Rougned Odor at second to force out the runner from first (Kole Calhoun).\nThe Rangers\u2019 triple play marked the first time that the batter was not retired on a triple play since June 3, 1912, in a game between Brooklyn and Cincinnati. It was the sixth triple play in Rangers history, the 11th against the Angels in their history and only the second by any team this season.\nWard would have been in a dire situation regardless of whether Profar had caught the ball.\nThe Angels went up 5-0 in the first after five consecutive singles and Francisco Aria\u2019s two-run double.

Come March 29th & we may still be lunging in the dark.\nThe scenes emanating of the house of commons of the colossal UK parliament are no less an exhibition, a circus of democracy at its hilarious zenith. One could feel the unease, the uncertainty & the unconvincing arguments on both sides of Brexit divide with neither of the two in a position to claim absolute moral victory. The tweaking & twisting, changing & churning & the never ending debate as a prelude to the D-day may yet not lead to what the British people want or do not want. They are a confused lot to say the least.\nEndless arguments British Prime Minister Theresa May is losing her grip over her party and it doesn\u2019t appear she will get support from parliamentarian to pass Brexit deal in the House by the 29 March deadline. The European Union has also made it clear that it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, leaving no scope for Theresa May to breathe easy on an issue which once helped her ride through popularity to become Prime Minister. She has already indicated that she will quit her office after March. Her stand is that she will not compromise on workers\u2019 rights, nor she will undermine environmental concern while renegotiating a deal with the EU over Brexit.\nThe UK wants to be part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union, even after leaving the 28 European nations club, but there is no hint the latter will agree to the British proposal. The Customs Union is an important element of the EU Single Market. Under its rules, the EU operates as a trade bloc, operating common external tariffs and customs barriers, and negotiating trade deals as one. As a member of the Customs Union, the UK is not allowed to negotiate other bilateral trade deals. If the UK leaves the Customs Union, the former will not be able to get benefit from the EU\u2019s 56 free trade agreement (FTAs), which provide better access to markets outside of the EU, such as Korea, Mexico and Chile. This may mean that UK exporters face higher tariffs and other trade barriers in these markets.\nHowever, as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March, 2019, regardless of whether there is a deal with the EU or not. Though the European Court of Justice on 10 December 2018 ruled that the UK could remain a member of the EU on its existing terms by cancelling the Article 50 Brexit process without the permission of the other 27 EU members, the Theresa May government has made it clear that the UK will leave the EU.\nFor the moment, what is irritating is that different ministers in the UK are on different pages on the issue of Customs Union. Liam Fox who is handling Brexit issue has been tasked with striking new international trade deals seems to suggest that the Government does intend to make a clean break from the Customs Union \u2013 because, as a member, building these new relationships would not be possible.\nBut the Prime Minister\u2019s comments in Scotland and Northern Ireland suggest a prioritization of new trading arrangements that are as close to the status quo as possible. At some point soon, these ambiguous signals will have to be resolved.\nThere is also another important consideration about leaving the EU Customs Union which we haven\u2019t heard much about yet: the UK\u2019s relationship with the World Trade Organization. The terms of UK membership of the WTO are currently governed by its membership of the EU Customs Union. So, when the UK leaves the EU, the UK\u2019s existing WTO commitments"}
{"idx": "1895", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Earlier this month, the Linux Foundation announced the formation of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) \u2013 a new foundation that joins the likes of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and Open Container Initiative (OCI).\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) has become an essential building block of modern application lifecycle management. This technique allows business to increase the velocity of delivering software to users. Through CI/CD, what was once confined to large, web-scale companies became available to early-stage startups and enterprises.\nEven though CI/CD is possible with traditional IaaS, it becomes more efficient with the shift to containers. The rise of containers and microservices enabled developers and operators to ship software at a much rapid pace. CI/CD acts as the glue that connects the dots across multiple stages involved in coding, testing, packaging, deployment and managing the software. By securely integrating source control management with build management software and a release management tool, the engineering teams automate the process of rapidly iterating through the build and release phases of software.\nThe increased adoption of CI/CD based on containers resulted in a new breed of software. CloudBees, the company that owns the most popular and widely used CI/CD system called Jenkins, created JenkinsX, a unique flavor of Jenkins that targets containers and Kubernetes. JenkinsX extended the power of Jenkins to the cloud native ecosystem. Meanwhile, Netflix collaborated with key cloud platform vendors including AWS, Google, and Microsoft to build Spinnaker \u2013 an open source cloud native release management tool. More recently, Google invested in creating Tekton, an open source CI/CD tool that\u2019s a part of Knative, an event-driven platform based on Kubernetes.\nThe projects such as JenkinsX, Spinnaker, and Tekton offer similar features with little reuse and integration. There are many other open source and commercial projects available in the crowded DevOps market. This fragmentation led to confusion in using the best of the breed toolchain for bringing CI/CD to modern applications.\nWith the launch of CDF, Linux Foundation has taken the first step in bringing the most popular CI/CD tools under the same roof. This would enable key contributors such as CloudBees, Netflix, Google, and other members to collaborate rather than duplicating the efforts. The foundation would encourage members to contribute to critical areas of software delivery with an increased focus. This immensely helps the ecosystem in adopting the best of the breed tools and the best practices of implementing CI/CD pipelines. Ultimately, there would be a standardized mechanism for CI/CD that removes the fragmentation of tools.\nThough Google, IBM, and Alibaba represent the public cloud ecosystem, it\u2019s a matter of time before AWS and Microsoft join the CD Foundation. AWS has a parallel DevOps and CI/CD toolchain in the form of CodeCommit, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline that compete with Github, Jenkins and Spinnaker. Microsoft has redesigned its legacy ALM suite, VSTS, as Azure DevOps to implement CI/CD on its private and public cloud platforms. Github, which is now a part of Microsoft, plays a crucial role in Azure DevOps offering. Google has also been working on Skafflod, Kaniko, and Knative to deliver CI/CD pipelines on Kubernetes.\nIf CDF defines standard mechanisms and artifacts to declare the build and release stages that are adopted by cloud vendors and key DevOps vendors, customers will benefit from portability and reuse of toolchains. A tool that\u2019s used in an existing pipeline may be easily swapped"}

Deflation is the opposite \u2013 price decreases over time \u2013 but inflation is far more common.\nIf inflation is 10%, then a \u00a350 pair of shoes will cost \u00a355 in a year's time and \u00a360.50 a year after that.\nInflation eats away at the value of wages and savings \u2013 if you earn 10% on your savings but inflation is 10%, the real rate of interest on your pot is actually 0%.\nA relatively new phenomenon, inflation has become a real worry for governments since the 1960s.\nAs a rule of thumb, times of high inflation are good for borrowers and bad for investors.\nMortgages are a good example of how borrowing can be advantageous \u2013 annual inflation of 10% over seven years halves the real value of a mortgage.\nOn the other hand, pensioners, who depend on a fixed income, watch the value of their assets erode.\nThe government's preferred measure of inflation, and the one the Bank of England takes into account when setting interest rates, is the consumer price index (CPI).\nThe retail prices index (RPI) is often used in wage negotiations.\nThe consumer prices index, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 2.8% for August, up from 2.6% in July, and close to the four-year high of 2.9% reached in June.\nTransport costs are likely to be one of the main drivers of higher inflation, as petrol and diesel have become more expensive in recent weeks.\nWages, though, are not keeping pace. City economists predict that Wednesday\u2019s labour market statistics will show that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. This would be an improvement on the 2.1% recorded a month ago, but still means that real wages are falling.\nAnalysts at Investec predict the UK unemployment rate could drop to 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. But they caution that there are still no sign that wage growth is taking off.\nBusiness advisers BDO have warned that the rise in employment has not yet delivered higher productivity either.\nPeter Hemington, a partner at BDO, explained: \u201cUK employment law is sufficiently elastic to give employers the comfort that they can flex workforces quickly as market conditions change.\nUnion leaders will renew their calls for the government to lift the 1% pay cap on public sector workers, when they gather for the Trades Union Congress in Brighton.\nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said Theresa May\u2019s administration was \u201cout of step\u201d with the national mood.\n\u201cAfter seven long years of pay freezes and limits on their wages, ambulance workers, school meals staff, police and community support officers and other public service employees all deserve so much better,\u201d Prentis said."}

They are busy, well-motivated and well-financed.\nJust one example serves to show just how prolific they are. Every day, come rain or shine, they crank out about 250,000 novel variants of viruses.\nTheir vigour has helped them steal data from some really big companies, Target, Home Depot and eBay, in the last few months.\nAnd, what is a problem for the big companies is even more acute for the smaller firms. They have an even tougher time keeping the bad guys out.\n\"They are exposed to many of the same attacks as much larger enterprises, yet they don't have the security expertise and resources available to those larger firms,\" said Maxim Weinstein, a security advisor at security firm Sophos.\nWhile attacks on the eBays and Sonys of the world make the headlines there's no doubt that smaller firms are getting hit. And getting hit hard.\nFigures from Sophos suggest about 30,000 websites a day are being compromised by cyber bad guys - most of those will be the public face of one SME or others.\nBecoming a victim of a hack or breach costs smaller firms between \u00a365,000 and \u00a3115,000, according to the PWC survey of the worst data breaches among small firms. Those worst hit will suffer up to six breaches a year, PWC suggested, so the total cost could be even higher.\nFor a smaller firm finding that much cash to clean up after a breach could mean the difference between keeping trading and going bust.\nThis lack of focus on cyber security is understandable, said Mr Weinstein, as most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) spent most of their time on core commercial activity such as keeping customers happy, seeking out new clients and engaging in all the basic day-to-day admin needed to keep their enterprise afloat.\nWorrying about computer security comes a long down their To Do lists, he said.\nBut they do need to worry because the nature of commerce in the 21st century means that there are relatively few SMEs that do not make heavy use of technology, said Steven Harrison, lead technologist at IT services firm Exponential-e.\n\"You do see a knowledge gap,\" he said \"in that you have these smaller companies that are smaller in terms of people and revenue but they are not smaller in terms of the IT they use.\"\nEcommerce, websites, apps, smartphones, tablets, social media and cloud services were all now standard ways of doing business in the 21st century, he said.\nAnd, he added, there were some SMEs that were based entirely around technology but that did not make them experts in how to keep their digital business secure.\n\"There are some businesses that are much more than just users of technology,\" he said. \"They have huge computing requirements as well as massive storage and bandwidth requirements - far more than their head count would suggest.\"\nEither way, he said, everyone is a target and they all need to look externally to security firms for help.\n\"In the same way they don't run your own bank or accountancy firm they shouldn't run their own security operation,\" he said adding that SMEs often need help to understand the sheer range of threats arrayed against them.\nEveryone is familiar with attempts to penetrate internal networks to steal payment information or customer data records but may be less knowledgeable about invoice fraud, ransomware, malvertising, or even attacks that \"scrape\" websites with automated tools to steal all"}

{"idx": "1924", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Former DPP legislator Chou Po-lun's (\u5468\u4f2f\u502b) six-year jail sentence for his involvement in the Ronghsing Park scandal has been the subject of much debate. Many politicians believe that Chou has been sacrificed on the altar of judicial reform. Others feel that the 14-year delay in getting a verdict in the Ronghsing affair is merely a matter of justice horribly delayed.\nFrom a judicial perspective, Chou's sentencing is not a matter of political influence leading to a wrongful sentence. His accusation that five Supreme Court judges handed down their ruling without a careful review, his request for an extraordinary re-trial and a farewell party to see him off to jail were nothing more than an attempt to create a political future for himself once he gets out of jail. None of these things will have an impact on the justness of the judiciary.\nChou is one of the few serving legislators to be convicted and sent to jail in the past decade or so -- although he lost his seat last month when he was found guilty. During the KMT-era, the only ones to go to jail were former legislators Huang Hsin-chieh (\u9ec3\u4fe1\u4ecb) and Tsai Chen-chou (\u8521\u8fb0\u6d32).\nBut Chou has been closely associated with President Chen Shui-bian (\u9673\u6c34\u6241) and his status within the DPP was high. He has served as Chen's assistant. When running for a city council seat, he called himself a student of Chen's. He has also been convener of the DPP's legislative caucus. The fact that someone of his political stature abstained from either pulling strings to avoid going to jail or organizing public demonstrations to protest his conviction, shows Chou's and the party's respect for the law. Such an unusual -- for Taiwan -- move is worthy of appreciation.\nBut Chou is not the only leading light of the DPP to face legal problems because of corruption allegations. Yu Chen Yueh-ying (\u4f59\u9673\u6708\u745b), senior advisor to the president, has been indicted by prosecutors in connection with the Zanadau affair and could face a four-year sentence if found guilty. The Yu family of Kaohsiung is the single most important family for the DPP in the south of the country. Yu Chen's indictment breaks the myth of politicians as untouchables.\nIn the KMT era the judiciary was always a political tool. The KMT leadership even allowed some politicians to get away after they were implicated in corruption cases. Former legislator Wu Tse-yuan (\u4f0d\u6fa4\u5143), who was hand-picked and cultivated by KMT Chairman Lien Chan (\u9023\u6230), later fled to China while on medical parole. Gloria Chu (\u6731\u5a49\u6e05), Lien's former office director, fled to the US following an embezzlement scandal involving government funds.\nThe actions of the DPP administration, in contrast, have been a major improvement in terms of judicial independence. The party demanded Chou respect the judiciary's ruling while Yu Chen resigned as senior advisor to the president as soon as she was indicted.\nThe DPP was elected because the people resented the KMT's legacy of corruption. In the three years of DPP rule, there have been corruption cases at both the central and local government levels, such as the vote-buying scandal in the Kaohsiung City Council speaker's election. But the DPP has tried hard to avoid falling into the \"black gold\" quagm"}

A state of emergency frees up resources that can be used to prepare for a storm, and Louisiana\u2019s governor declared one yesterday because of the threat of flash flooding. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu also declared a state of emergency for the city today.\nLee could unleash \u201cefficient and torrential topical rains\u201d for the next several days, the US National Weather Service said.\nIn the French Quarter, some tourists were caught off guard by the storm as it rained on and off. Kyla Holley of Madison, Wisconsin and her husband, Rob, were in for the Labour Day weekend holiday.\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from Mississippi to Texas, including New Orleans, and flash flood warnings extended along the Alabama coast into the Florida Panhandle. The National Hurricane Centre said the system will dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over southern areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama through Sunday and as much as 20 inches in some spots.\nThe storm also has cut off nearly half the normal oil production from the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s US waters. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said Friday that 169 of the 617 manned production platforms in the Gulf have been evacuated, along with 16 of the 62 drilling rigs now operating in the Gulf. The evacuations have resulted in the shut-off of 47.6 per cent of the Gulf\u2019s daily normal oil production and 33 per cent of the normal daily natural gas production.\nThe water-logged storm is tantalizingly close to Texas but still too far away to alleviate the state\u2019s worst drought since the 1950s. If the centre moves mostly into Louisiana, as expected, winds on its west side will blow from land to open water and reduce the chance of rain in Texas, NWS meteorologist Dennis Cavanaugh in Fort Worth said. The hot, dry winds could spur fire danger across the state.\nIn Alabama, Gov Robert Bentley didn\u2019t declare an emergency but ordered state agencies to be ready to respond if needed.\nMorning skies were overcast with spotty rain on the Alabama coast Friday morning, but workers were still putting boats in the water for the Labour Day weekend at Sportsman Marina in Orange Beach, Ala.\nLee is the 12th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.\nThe National Hurricane Centre said the centre of Lee was about 320 km southeast of Cameron, Louisiana, on Friday and moving northwest at just 4 kph.

{"idx": "1943", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Brimming with rainstorms and harvest festivals, spring flowers and the spiritual chill of winter, Joseph Haydn's 1801 oratorio \"The Seasons\" is an expansive, summary work. Coming, like \"The Creation,\" late in the composer's career, it pours forth with an expressive liberality. The work's form, the character of the individual arias and choral episodes, is not rigidly determined but rather carefully shaped to the sprawling libretto, based on a cycle of poems by James Thomson. (The English text was translated into German. ) Three soloists join forces with a resourceful orchestra and choir to paint these vivid musical pictures of humanity and nature through the year. It all comes teemingly to life in this splendid performance, directed by Rene Jacobs. Right away, with wind gusts conjured by the Freiburger Barockorchester, winter convincingly gives way to spring. Maidens in the spring fields inspire the composer's giddy, almost nervous ecstasy. The onset of autumn brings burnished orchestral colors and a vividly depicted hunting scene. An aria in winter has a lean, almost Schubertian poignancy. Baritone Dietrich Henschel (left) is both forceful and pliant. Tenor Werner Gura sings with lyrical immediacy. Marlis Petersen is the radiant soprano. The RIAS-Kammerchor responds as one to everything Haydn asks of his alert and responsive choir. -- Steven Winn.\nEven listeners who know what kind of splendor to expect from the singing of mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson may be taken aback by the richness and dramatic power of her newest release. This collection of Handel arias, cannily chosen and exquisitely sung, ranges from the familiar to the outre, and all of it is dispatched with Hunt Lieberson's trademark combination of dusky, mellifluous tone, extraordinary control and unerring expressivity. The disc's centerpiece is the rarely heard dramatic cantata \"La Lucrezia.\" It's a wrenching and almost alarmingly violent piece of dramatic writing, and Hunt Lieberson lends it an unnerving intensity. She also revisits the oratorio \"Theodora,\" which she recorded memorably with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra back when she was still a soprano, and finds new profundity in its limpid melodic writing."}

Each performer brought the impulses of Girma Yifrashewa, Vivaldi, Schubert and Coltrane.\nThe last set of the program concluded with two unpublished works from Emahoy.

The final and her most well known work received a splendid, big over- the-top-rendition from Adam Zerihoun, a 16-year-old from New Jersey with stunning fingerwork.\nThe nostalgic mood of the program signified a torch-passing moment from one generation to another.

{"idx": "1945", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Are All Psychiatric Drugs Too Unsafe to Take?\nPsychiatric drugs are more dangerous than you have ever imagined. If you haven\u2019t been prescribed one yet, you are among the lucky few. If you or a loved one are taking psychiatric drugs, there is hope; but you need to understand the dangers and how to minimize the risk.\nThe following overview focuses on longer-term psychiatric drug hazards, although most of them can begin to develop within weeks. They are scientifically documented in my recent book Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal and my medical text Brain-Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry, Second Edition.\nAntipsychotic drugs, including both older and newer ones, cause shrinkage (atrophy) of the brain in many human brain scan studies and in animal autopsy studies. The newer atypicals especially cause a well-documented metabolic syndrome including elevated blood sugar, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity and hypertension. They also produce dangerous cardiac arrhythmias and unexplained sudden death, and they significantly reduce longevity. In addition, they cause all the problems of the older drugs, such as Thorazine and Haldol, including tardive dyskinesia, a largely permanent and sometimes disabling and painful movement disorder caused by brain damage and biochemical disruptions.\nRisperdal in particular but others as well cause potentially permanent breast enlargement in young boys and girls. The overall risk of harmful long-term effects from antipsychotic drugs exceeds the capacity of this review. Withdrawal from antipsychotic drugs can cause overwhelming emotional and neurological suffering, as well as psychosis in both children and adults, making complete cessation at times very difficult or impossible.\nDespite their enormous risks, the newer antipsychotic drugs are now frequently used off-label to treat anything from anxiety and depression to insomnia and behavior problems in children. Two older antipsychotic drugs, Reglan and Compazine, are used for gastrointestinal problems, and despite small or short-term dosing, they too can cause problems, including tardive dyskinesia.\nNowadays, many patients are given medications for insomnia without being told that they are in fact receiving very dangerous antipsychotic drugs. This can happen with any antipsychotic but most frequently occurs with Seroquel, Abilify and Zyprexa. The patient is unwittingly exposed to all the hazards of antipsychotic drugs.\nThe FDA has approved some antipsychotic drugs as augmentation for treating depression along with antidepressants. As a result, patients are often misinformed that they are getting an \u201cantidepressant\u201d when they are in fact getting one of the newer antipsychotic drugs, with all of their potentially disastrous adverse effects. Patients are similarly misled by being told that they are getting a \u201cbipolar\u201d drug when it is an antipsychotic drug.\nThe SSRIs are probably the most fully studied antidepressants, but the following observations apply to most or all antidepressants. These drugs produce long-term apathy and loss of quality of life. Many studies of SSRIs show severe brain abnormalities, such as shrinkage (atrophy) with brain cell death in humans and the growth of new abnormal brain cells in animal and laboratory studies. They frequently produce an apathy syndrome \u2014 a generalized loss of motivation or interest in many or all aspects of life. The SSRIs frequently cause irreversible dysfunction and loss of interest in sexuality, relationship and love. Withdrawal from all antidepressants"}

His crude jokes and behavior would have resulted in Shooter being fired from any corporate workplace long ago.\nBut Mesnard did not initially favor expulsion. His plan was to censure Shooter. He also told Shooter that no further misbehavior would be tolerated.\nA letter from Shooter this morning made Mesnard decide to pursue expulsion, the House speaker explained before casting his vote to expel.\nIn the letter, Shooter challenged the report and cited a victim\u2019s concerns.\nMesnard contacted that victim and found that Shooter\u2019s letter was not an effort to help, but rather an \u201ceffort to use the individual as a pawn,\u201d Mesnard said on the House floor.\nIt was not an easy vote. Some members shed tears.

Shooter also declined years' worth of opportunities to behave with respect toward lobbyists and fellow lawmakers. Instead, he treated them as objects and diminished their humanity with lewd comments.\nCredit also goes to Rep. Kelly Townsend, who upped the ante and demanded Shooter resign or be expelled. She did so before the House speaker had decided to take that approach.\nAll of those who voted to remove Shooter from an office he shamed deserve credit for putting the integrity of the institution above loyalty to another elected official.\nYet it was long overdue.\nShooter\u2019s behavior would not have been tolerated in corporate America.

What's been created has become one of the biggest phenomenons in the history of pop culture... and it's far from wrapping things up. There are still many years ahead for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it begins with what's being built over the next few years as Phase Four.\nUnlike what Marvel did for the beginning of Phase Three, when they held a big press event announcing their future plans, the company has yet to officially announce the majority of their upcoming slate. That being said, through various official releases, news items, and quotes we have been able to piece together at least some of what's going on behind-the-scenes. What do we know right now? Read on and find out.\nThe first Marvel Cinematic Universe feature to be released after the events of Avengers 4 is actually the only Phase Four project that currently has an official release date. After earning rave reviews for his work on Spider-Man: Homecoming, director Jon Watts is back at the helm, and it's been confirmed that the story will pick up literally minutes after the end of the big Joe and Anthony Russo-directed blockbuster bonanza that is coming out in May 2019.\nPeter Parker (Tom Holland) will somehow be alive again at the start of the movie - a reversal of the events that took place at the end of Avengers: Infinity War - and as the title suggests he won't be hanging around Queens, New York all that much. Instead, the story featured in Spider-Man: Far From Home will have the wall-crawling hero swinging his webs around various locations throughout Europe. He, apparently, won't have the assistance of Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in this one, but he will have some notable Marvel Cinematic Universe veterans as allies: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who were also dusted by the end of Infinity War.\nOn the villain front, Spider-Man: Far From Home will take a page out of Spider-Man: Homecoming's playbook and introduce a villain that audiences have not yet seen depicted in live-action. Specifically, Jake Gyllenhaal is on-board to play the special effects-loving antagonist Quentin Beck a.k.a. Mysterio. It's not yet been revealed exactly how he will fit into the plot regarding Peter Parker's European vacation, but we're excited to find out.\nFor a more in-depth look at what to expect from Spider-Man: Far From Home, be sure to check out our What We Know So Far guide.\nWhile Marvel Studios has had no trouble breaking box office records, Ryan Coogler's Black Panther went far beyond anything experts were expecting. Released in early 2018 and expected to serve as an appetizer for Avengers: Infinity War, the film instead managed to out-gross the massive team-up movie domestically, and is not only the biggest Marvel movie ever released in the United States, but is also the third highest grosser the country has ever seen.\nWe pretty much always expected that Black Panther 2 was going to be in the cards for Phase Four, long before any of the box office numbers, but Marvel Studios made it official in mid-October 2018.

There is nothing explicitly about this in the buy-out rules in the CBA, but it's something that has been widely reported over the years from multiple, reputable sources, so if there's smoke there is probably fire. It is very likely linked to the waiver requirements.\nAh - I didn't realize that the buy out was for a reduced price on the contracted price (2/3rds in Despres case).\nHe would have no reason to take the buy out. He'd get less money, and it'd be doled out over twice as many years, so it would be crap both ways from his perspective (and from any injured player's perspective).\nI'm not sure why I thought that the buy out was just a straight up purchase of the remaining contract price.\nLooks like the best we can do is try to finagle a LTIR out of it, each year.\nI wonder if teams get insurance to cover the salary outlay in such cases, or if the insurance premiums are/would be too large, generally?\nThanks for the buy-out school!\nMaybe he can just sue the Colorado Avalanche to make up the difference."}

{"idx": "1959", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: An illuminating study compares the willingness of stage IV cancer patients, and their caregivers; to pay to extend their lives by one year against that of other end-of-life improvements. The research, led by members of the Lien Centre for Palliative Care (LCPC) and collaborators from the National Cancer Centre Singapore, was recently published in the journal, Palliative Medicine.\nPatients with advanced cancer or other life limiting illnesses often have to consider how much money they are willing to spend on high cost treatments that result in only moderate improvements in length or quality of life. These decisions are very difficult for patients to make, and in some cases the decision is entirely deferred to a family caregiver.\nPast research has shown that in addition to extending life, being free of pain and dying at home are important considerations for people nearing the end of their lives. However, the value that patients place on these considerations or their willingness to pay for either was not previously known.\nA team led by Professor Eric Finkelstein and Assistant Professor Chetna Malhotra from the LCPC in Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School (Duke-NUS) administered surveys to 211 patients with stage IV cancer and their informal caregivers to find out more about their end-of-life preferences.\nParticipants were asked to choose their most-preferred end-of-life scenarios out of a series of options that varied along key dimensions, including years of life remaining, degree of pain experienced, place of death, level of burden on caregivers, quality of healthcare experience, cost, and source of payment (cash, Medisave, or family members' cash or Medisave). Using the results, the authors quantified patients and caregivers willingness to pay to improve their end of life experience.\nThey found that patients' willingness to pay to extend their life by one year was valued at S$18,570, which is lower than their willingness to pay to avoid severe pain (S$22,199), or to die at home (S$31,256), and only slightly more than their willingness to pay to receive a high-quality health-care experience (S$16,191). Caregivers had a three-fold greater willingness to pay than patients to extend life by one year and for most of the other features considered.\nDr. Finkelstein believes these results suggest that health insurers and physicians may be putting too much emphasis on life extending treatments for these patients. He notes, \"Results highlight the importance of pain management, supporting home deaths, and addressing other end-of-life concerns, in addition to efforts to extend life.\"\nDr. Malhotra added that the differences in patients' and caregivers' willingness to pay suggest the need for eliciting patient preferences directly during treatment decision making as opposed to relying on caregiver input, \"We hope this research helps foster greater communication between patients, caregivers, and doctors\".\nThe team is planning to extend this research to test patient decision aids that can help ensure that patients' end-of-life experience is most consistent with their preferences.\nDuke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapo. \"Dying patients' choices not always aligned to caregivers' .\" Medical News Today.

The \u201cLast Supper\u201d photo Sci Fi has used to promote the show this season includes both Adamas, and executive producer Ron Moore said in an interview the final Cylon is not depicted in that image.\nThe empty cup is supposed to represent the last Cylon. You can see the photo (and watch a 10-minute promo of tonight\u2019s episode) here.\nEric has a new theory. The four revealed at the end of season three \u2014 Tigh, Tyrol, Tory and Samuel T. Anders \u2014 all had a \"T\" in their names. That could set up Kara Thrace or Tom Zarek as the final Cylon. But Eric thinks that\u2019s actually a weak theory.\nEric and Maria were kicking around some ideas in an earlier email thread. I will set this up by saying the promo video implies D\u2019Anna is telling Laura Roslin, the ailing colonial president played by Mary McDonnell, that she (Roslin) is a Cylon.\nEric: Roslin doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s reacting to D\u2019Anna. She reacts to something, but I think she would look much more horrified if she was just told she was a Cylon.\nMaria: I thought it was (Felix) Gaeta too, but after seeing how manipulative (Romo) Lampkin was, he\u2019s got another vote. Can I get two votes?\nEric: It\u2019s not Romo. Besides, he\u2019s not on the base ship.\nMaria: Neither is Tyrol or Tigh.\nEric: Well, if we believe D\u2019Anna is going to out the final Cylon tonight, that person would have to be on the base ship.\nMy personal feeling is that it\u2019s Gaeta but I\u2019m intrigued by the idea it\u2019s Cottle. We know that it\u2019s a skin job. Hypothetically, it could be several different characters who have already been killed before the story even began. Hence, the empty place at the \"table\" of the story of BSG characters.\nHowever, if we take them at their word that the final cylon is not in the picture, only consider \"live\" characters, believe it is someone of significance, and somewhat known, the choices are narrowed to Felix Gaeta, Dee Dualla, Doc Cottle and Romo Lampkin.

Bowe Bergdahl, and time is running short.\n\"It's possible that President Obama could make a big move in his last two years, presumably after the midterm elections,\" said John Bellinger, a former legal adviser to the State Department and National Security Council. \"But it's equally possible he will decide he can't close it or Congress will make it impossible to close and it will get kicked down the road to his successor.\"\nThe remaining 149 prisoners fall into several, somewhat fluid categories. Nearly 80 of them have been approved for transfer to their homelands or a third country. Those moves have gradually resumed after coming to a halt due to security requirements imposed by Congress that were altered last year.\nSome who have criticized the government for moving too slowly on transfers say the exchange for Bergdahl, which took place without a required 30-day notice to Congress, shows the Obama administration can act more forcefully to close Guantanamo.\n\"This illustrates that the U.S. government can transfer prisoners when it is motivated to do so,\" said Wells Dixon, an attorney with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights who has represented prisoners at Guantanamo. \"There are four more Afghans cleared for transfer and they need to be transferred. He can start with them.\"\nMany legal experts have argued that the U.S. will lose its authority under international law to hold members of the Taliban without charge when combat comes to an end in Afghanistan. That thinking, which wouldn't necessarily apply to Guantanamo prisoners who are affiliated with al-Qaida, may have been a factor in the exchange for Bergdahl, said Bellinger, who served during the administration of President George W.

Her statement came a week after Constitutional Commission Chairman Sean McWeeny, QC, said that because of the Privy Council\u2019s \u201cphilosophical opposition\u201d to capital punishment, hangings are unlikely to ever be upheld unless substantial changes are made to this country\u2019s legal and judicial system through constitutional amendments.\nHe was speaking after Court of Appeal justices said \u201changing is over\u201d during back and forth discourse with prosecutors at a hearing last week where they squashed the death sentence of Anthony Clarke Sr, who was convicted last year of a contract killing.\nWhen asked for his perspective on the matter yesterday, prominent attorney Wayne Munroe lamented that criticism is levied at the Privy Council on the matter, saying that Bahamian politicians knowingly let the \u201cvoiceless\u201d London-based institution take blame for an issue they \u201ccan, but do not want\u201d to address.\nMr Munroe disagreed with Mr McWeeney\u2019s position that constitutional changes should be made to tie the hands of appellate courts by defining what crimes constitute the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d and should therefore be punishable by death.\nThe solution, he said, is to not allow judges to rely on their judgement about whether the death penalty is merited. Such issues, he said, should be decided upon by a jury.\nIn 2011, after a ruling from the Privy Council, the Ingraham administration amended the Penal Code to specify the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d murders which would warrant execution.\nMr Munroe blasted the amendment, however, saying: \u201cWhen the (government) did act, it did so in an inadequate manner. The FNM passed nonsense that they didn\u2019t talk to anybody about. These guys who never saw the insides of a court or consulted the private bar did something that was ineffective.\nCriminal prosecution as practiced in our country is largely a failure: prolonged wait, in most instances for many years before cases make their way to court, witnesses and victims not showing up to court, evidence being judged inadequate or contaminated, alleged police brutality, prosecutors constantly out-foxed by highly paid/experienced/ superior defense attorneys.\nI understand the frustration about crime and the lack of faith in our judicial system, not to mention the deterioration in our socialization and child rearing prowess. However why Mrs. AG waste time and limited resources perusing a death penalty that's not going to happen, despite what Mr. Munroe espouses?! Remember his', and his ilk benefit with every court appearance. Evidence, in the form of many peer reviewed studies, has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent for the type of murders we see here in Nassau. It is morally reprehensible and archaic.\nI for one will be most happy once we accept its ultimate demise!\nYou are free to keep that attitude - but the death penalty will remain in full force on the streets.\nOh, and what do the churches say about that \"child rearing prowess\" you mentioned?????????????

{"idx": "1970", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: By Savion Glover and Bruce Weber.\nWilliam Morrow & Company. $19.95.\nTap fits uneasily into book form. The dance is all about sound and movement; Gutenberg's descendants sit silent and static. The tap star Savion Glover, in particular, is all about loud: a heel hard enough to break the floor, a shuffle to make you skip a heartbeat.\nBut the book works -- in part because it uses more than language. Sometimes its medium is a written approximation of metal against floor: ''Tickety BLOO kah tickety bloo kah SHUCK.'' Sometimes the noise and the funk come in the many evocative photographs, or the eye-popping graphic design by Paula Kelly, who deserves much of the praise for the book's success.\nThe loose narrative takes readers through Glover's preschool drummer days and the Broadway success of ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' which he choreographed and starred in. The story has intrinsic interest, because, as Gregory Hines says in his introduction, Glover is ''the greatest tap-dancer to ever lace up a pair of Capezios or any other tap shoes.'' But the real interest is in Glover's commentary: as he explains what he learned at each stage, his voice is light, straightforward and yet convincing as that of a unique and world-class artist.\nGlover is fluent in tongue as well as foot, able to analyze his own work better than most artists. He gets us inside the creative process, which, for him, seems equal parts muse-sent inspiration and simple logic: brilliant insight and some elbow (or knee) grease. He never seems otherworldly, but his art is impressive nonetheless. Weber writes that ''you count a dozen or more places on his feet that hit the floor and make different sounds: a whole rattletrap full of thwacks, clacks, tippy-tippies, thunks, sweeps, swishes and slams. Plus, he's loud.'' Glover actually describes those places for us -- and, in one of the book's many design pleasures, we get a two-page diagram of a foot with sound locations.\nThese are perfect lessons for young adolescents, who will appreciate the injunction to ''hit,'' and whose parents will appreciate the creative discipline of this rebellion. Glover shows his readers how to bring the noise and the funk with the force of history. The best audience for ''Savion! My Life in Tap'' is probably dancers and those who have loved one of Glover's many projects. But because of what the book tells us about artistic process -- and artistic progress -- it is worthwhile for all.\nA caveat: it will be the precocious 10-year-old who can deal with all the vocabulary words in this book. But it will be the rare 10-year-old who is not inspired to be precocious by Savion Glover's story."}

The payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts and money for lectures. Not included are free drug samples, or payments for clinical research studies.\nBut the public can\u2019t find out the names of all the doctors who got the money. The attorney general\u2019s office disclosed some of the names under the access to public records laws. But other names were not released because the companies claimed the disclosure would violate trade secrets.\nKen Libertoff is the executive director of the Vermont Association for Mental Health.\n(Libertoff) It is disappointing that because of trade secret clause in our current law there is no way that we can tell you who the 11 psychiatrists were who took an average of about $60,000 in gifts in 2007.\n(Dillon) The Vermont Psychiatric Association is also calling for full disclosure. The association recently approved a policy that says its members should not accept money from drug companies. Doctor Thomas Simpatico is president of the group.\n(Simpatico) On the one hand things that have in the past felt like innocuous practices may have some influence on prescribing practices. \u2026 I think the growing sentiment among physicians, certainly it is the sentiment of the Vermont Psychiatric Association, is simply the possibility that there could be any influence that was not based on scientific information or best practice is enough of a reason to abolish it.

She says the Attorney General\u2019s office is looking at how the exemption could be lifted.\n(Brill) We are examining the issue now. It\u2019s essentially a legal issue.

Please proceed with caution if you wish to avoid potential spoilers from either platforms.\nIn the comic book series that AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead is based on, after the All Out War story arc, there is the introduction of a new group called the Whisperers. This group moves among the undead using the skins of walkers to hide themselves.\nAlong with this new group, two characters who TVLine that have reported as being cast for The Walking Dead TV series, also make an appearance in the comic books at the same time. Yumiko and Magna end up becoming citizens of Alexandria, a place that, in the TV series, is currently mostly destroyed.\nFor fans of the comic books, the introduction of Yumiko and Magna is making them a little nervous \u2014 especially those who are fans of Michonne in the TV series.\nEven though Michonne is present in The Walking Dead comic books, she is not in a relationship with Rick. While there is the slight suggestion that Michonne may have feelings for Rick, their relationship has been purely platonic and Michonne is often seen as being Rick\u2019s right hand woman.\nInstead, in the comics, Andrea is still alive and she and Rick are together. Much of the storyline in The Walking Dead TV series between Rick and Michonne mirrors that seen in the comics. So, it appears that after AMC killed off Andrea, they simply placed her remaining comic book storyline onto Michonne\u2019s TV counterpart.\nOf course, for fans of The Walking Dead comics, this now means that the possibility of Michonne\u2019s death on the TV show could be imminent with the arrival of Yumiko and Magna. While they are not directly involved with Andrea\u2019s death in The Walking Dead comics, their storyline does, ultimately, lead the group down a path that will result in the demise of Andrea.\nSo, if Michonne has now replaced Andrea\u2019s position from the comics, this could mean fans will have another heartbreaking death to witness in Season 9 of The Walking Dead. Although, considering how much the TV series now strays from the comics, the potential is also there that AMC will keep Michonne alive thanks to her massive popularity.\nHowever, fans will just have to tune into Season 9 of The Walking Dead to find out Michonne\u2019s ultimate fate."}

A former Trump strategist, a conservative cardinal with a penchant for fancy ceremonial gowns, and a far-right xenophobe walk into a bar in Rome. In this case, the Trump strategist is Steve Bannon, the conservative cardinal is American Raymond Burke, and the xenophobe is Italy\u2019s new interior minister Matteo Salvini. No, they aren\u2019t in a bar, but they are conspiring against one man, Pope Francis, on the issue most dear to him: immigration.\nIn a series of statements ahead of World Refugee Day on Wednesday, Francis called for integration and acceptance, not borders and closed ports. \u201cI hope that the states involved in these processes reach an understanding to assure, with responsibility and humanity, assistance to and the protection of those who are forced to flee their own country,\u201d he said in one of his many messages to mark the occasion.\nBut the pope\u2019s words have fallen on the deaf ears of many politicians, and sparked outrage from Bannon, Burke, and Salvini. Bannon told ABC News this week that the Catholic Church was \u201cone of the worst instigators of this open borders policy,\u201d singling out Francis as the main reason for the migration crisis in Europe (which began long before Francis was elected in 2013). Bannon, who proclaims his own Catholic faith, previously has said the Catholic Church just needs \u201cillegal aliens\u201d to fill its pews.\nWhen Bannon was in Rome in early June to celebrate Italy\u2019s new populist government run by Salvini, Five Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio and their previously unknown puppet Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, he also took a side trip to the Trisulti monastery. It\u2019s an 800-year-old gem of real estate a few hours from Rome being developed by Benjamin Harnwell, a conservative British Catholic with ties to UKIP, the party that built its reputation pushing for Brexit, as a bastion for right-wing-thinking types.\nThe monastery will host events with speakers like Bannon and Burke and conservative Christian leaders. \u201cTrisulti will be the home of a number of projects that underscore the fact that man is made in the image and likeness of God, and that recognition of the imago Dei is the cornerstone of the Judaeo-Christian foundations of Western Civilization,\u201d Harnwell, who did not respond to requests for an interview, is quoted as saying on his website.\nHarnwell and his organization are an important connection between Bannon and Burke. Harnwell is the one who first introduced the two, according to a New York Times article that is displayed on Harnwell\u2019s website. Bannon spoke at one of Harnwell\u2019s\u2019 conferences by grainy video link back in 2014 during which he warned that the migration exodus would lead to a rise in populism. Burke was the keynote speaker the year before.\nBurke is one of the pope\u2019s chief detractors, openly questioning Francis\u2019 ability to run the church and campaigning for a lessening of papal powers.

I know I'm not overweight by any means, but I made a decision that I was ready to change up my normal diet and workout routine to see how it would change my body and improve my current level of fitness. My hope was that I would become leaner and stronger and have more energy!\nIn July of 2016, I threw myself into the arms of CrossFit, since many experts agree that high-intensity workouts and weightlifting are effective ways of getting in great shape. Prior to this, I primarily worked out through running and doing yoga.\nAfter eight months of CrossFit, I loved my newfound confidence and strength, but I was frustrated. I was working out at 5:45 a.m. four or five times a week and still not reaching my body goals. It became clear that I needed to change my diet. I was finding that after those intense morning workouts, I wanted to eat all day long. Ultimately, I gained weight, and it wasn't just muscle.\nEarly last year, I was looking through YouTube videos about \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 CrossFit, when I came upon someone talking about intermittent fasting (IF). I had no idea those videos would change my life forever.\n\"[Intermittent fasting] gets your body out of 'storage mode' and mobilizes fat stores for energy,\" said certified dietitian Leslie Langevin, MS, RD, CD, of Whole Health Nutrition. This means that without having a constant food source, your body will dip into the fat it already has stored as its energy source. Proponents of IF say that it can aid in weight loss and digestion and even help prevent disease.\nI did my research and decided on the 16:8 plan. You fast for 16 hours and have an eight-hour eating window. I aimed to eat from 12:00 to 8 p.m. It took me a few weeks to build up to not eating until noon, but after just one month, I started to notice a difference. I lost some weight and started to see definition in my abs and upper back.\nI know what you're thinking (because I was thinking it too): many experts say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and if you don't eat it, you'll screw up your metabolism. While I am not a nutritionist, the results I was getting made it seem like my metabolism was actually speeding up. And even though I was essentially skipping breakfast, I still felt satisfied and full. Before I started IF, I felt hungry all day long and felt the need to eat every two hours.\nBut more than weight loss, I was in love with all the other benefits I was getting from IF: better digestion, less bloating, better sleep, and more energy.\nBy month six of IF, I'll never forget looking in the mirror and seeing my body change even more. With this diet change, I was seeing noticeable results. Intermittent fasting wasn't hard for me. It was actually effortless by this point, and I wished I'd found it years earlier.\nFast forward and I just passed the one-year mark of doing intermittent fasting. It's given me so much energy that I've been able to really push myself at CrossFit and lift heavier, so I've actually gained five pounds, but my body looks so different! I have way more muscle definition in my abs, arms, and upper back.\nNot only that, but not eating in the morning has just about cured my belly bloat ("}

Hamas, which controls Gaza, has in the past not fulfilled less formal ceasefires by failing to halt all missile fire into Israel by breakaway Palestinian militants"}
