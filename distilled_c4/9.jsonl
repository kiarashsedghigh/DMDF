Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, or The Trocks as they're known to their fans, are the world's most famous all-male ballet company. A true dancing phenomenon, they've been pirouette-ing and pli\u00e9-ing en pointe since 1974, and this year marks The Trocks' Spoleto Festival debut. More exciting, hometown boy and veteran Trock-er Robert Carter will perform with his company in Charleston for the first time.\nCarter's career in ballet started when he was 7 years old. He was singing in the children's group Magic Circle at Middleton Place during Spoleto when he caught the eye of Robert Ivey. The local dance guru zeroed in on the young Carter and quickly contacted his mother, asking her if she would like some dance training to go with his singing.\n\"I saw Bobby, and he had so much enthusiasm,\" Ivey recalls. With his mother's encouragement, Carter enrolled at Robert Ivey Ballet School, where he quickly took to dance. \"After my first class, I couldn't wait to go back,\" Carter says. \"And since then, I knew that was what I wanted to do.\"\nFlash forward to today, and not only is Carter a star in The Trocks, he and Ivey are still close friends. \"I'll get calls in the middle of the night,\" says Ivey, \"and it'll be, 'Hey Mr. Ivey, it's Robert. I'm in Hungary today.' Or, 'I'm dancing in France.'\" The dancer credits his success to Ivey's influence and his mother's continued support. \"I think I was fortunate to have grown up in Charleston, because I had a supportive environment and was exposed to people who nurtured me on my way to where I am. I must say I have been blessed.\"\nThe biggest blessing, however, goes to the Spoleto audience members who seize the opportunity to see Carter and The Trocks perform. The cast dances in drag wearing pointe shoes, performing some of the world's most famous ballets, including Swan Lake, which Carter will showcase in Charleston. Although it's all farcical fun, the men take their moves seriously. It's true you have to have a sense of humor to be in the company, but more importantly, you need the ballet chops to match. \"When we're in a rehearsing period in New York, we work five days a week,\" Carter says. \"On tour, we don't rehearse as much, but first days in a theater, including the two hour show, can go as long as seven to eight hours.\"\nCarter honed his skills under Ivey's tutelage, but it was really the open-minded environment of Ivey's studio that allowed him to dabble with toe shoes, usually reserved for women. Ivey says, \"When he was about 12, Bobby said he was interested in trying out pointe, and we happened to have a girl in one of our classes with very large feet. So when she was done using her shoes, he'd try them on.\"\nLike any teacher, Ivey was thrilled Carter had so much interest \u2014 it didn't matter that he was studying in shoes generally meant for a feather-light ballerina. (In case you're curious, today Carter wears a 6.5 E in Bloch pointe shoes.) These early beginnings en pointe paid off. \"I had danced in a couple conventional ballet companies"}

Some studies have suggested that estrogen may lower the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. This hormone, however, has also been associated with a number of adverse health effects.\nA potential alternative approach to estrogen-based hormone therapy is a synthetic form of the hormone known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs can have the same effect as estrogen, but specifically target certain tissues and certain parts of the body. Two recently developed SERMs\u2014PPT and diarylpropionitrile (DPN)\u2014have been shown to protect cultured neurons from damage.\nFor their study, the researchers examined the effects of estrogen, PPT, and DPN on female mice. The data confirmed previous studies showing that estrogen significantly reduced the buildup in the brain of the protein beta amyloid, which has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Estrogen also reduced cognitive decline in the mice.\nThe researchers also observed that PPT was effective in lowering beta amyloid accumulation in most brain regions and also lessened working memory deficits.

Her father was heavily involved with the Senegalese Democratic Party, while her mother was a high-ranking judge on the country's constitutional council.\nEducated in Senegal and in Paris, she was involved in the French national students' union - later telling news outlet Jeune Afrique that she felt a desire to make changes to the lives of other students.\nShe said her leap to national politics was prompted by the 2002 French presidential election, in which the far-right National Front's Jean-Marie Le Pen made it to the second round. She joined the Socialists - and began her career in politics.\nShe first met Mr Macron when he was the deputy secretary general at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, and she was working for the economy minister - a job that Mr Macron would take over in 2014.\nWhen he declared his presidential ambitions, she joined his campaign team.

The appeal asks the court to allow a full panel of 22 judges to reconsider the case.\nA rejection by the appeals court would leave the administration with one final attempt to keep the chemical on the market \u2014 the Supreme Court.\nScott Pruitt, then the newly approved director of the federal EPA, overturned the ban in March 2017, in what was widely seen as a bellwether move for an administration that had promised less regulation to its agribusiness supporters.\nIn August, however, an appeals court called Pruitt\u2019s actions improper and reinstated the ban.\nChlorpyrifos is the most widely used pesticide in agriculture. The agriculture and chemical industries pushed hard to keep it available for more than 60 crops, including grapes, citrus fruit, almonds, walnuts, alfalfa and cotton. California growers apply about 900,000 pounds of the organophosphate compound, which attacks the nervous system, on about 640,000 acres, according to the state Department of Pesticide Regulation.\nThe department said use has declined steeply from more than a decade ago. Growers have struggled to find a replacement. They have switched to more pest-resistant crop varieties and tried alternative ways to control pests, including disruption of their mating cycles.\nThe original ban, enacted in November 2015, was the result of pressure from lawsuits brought by environmental groups. Those groups cited studies that linked the nerve-agent chemical to enduring intellectual deficits in children born to mothers who were exposed to the pesticide during pregnancy.\n\u201cThe EPA has never made any such determination and, indeed, has itself long questioned the safety of permitting chlorpyrifos to be used within the allowed tolerances,\u201d New York District Judge Jed S.

While they have become controversial in recent years, state tests represent a critical, yet often underutilized educational tool with major implications for equity, parent engagement and student success.\nLost in the furor around the testing opt-out movement is that state assessments play a role in ensuring that all children, particularly poor, minority, and special education students, are counted equally and treated fairly by states, districts and schools. While state tests are not perfect, the results provide a critical source of objective data that can be used to identify disparities and target resources to those most in need. Indeed, this is why nearly every civil rights organization in the nation supports annual assessments as a key strategy in the fight for educational equity.\nIn our work with Rochester area parents, we\u2019ve found that parents from lower performing schools often place more value on their child\u2019s state test score than school report cards and teacher feedback, due to concerns about school quality. All parents can use state test results as a second opinion or check-up on their child\u2019s school performance by looking for discrepancies between report cards and assessment scores and using that information to better understand their child\u2019s progress and needs.\nState tests can also help students planning to attend college or take other entrance exams in the future. New York state assessments are aligned with the SAT, providing an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with similar types of questions, build self-confidence, and get valuable test taking and time-management practice.\nIronically, many parents opposed to state testing will encourage their children to take assessments such as the SAT because they see a clear connection between the test and their child\u2019s future success. New York state has not done a good enough job making this connection for parents, helping fuel the testing opt-out movement.\nWhile the state has made significant and positive changes to the test recently, the timely release of scores remains a critical challenge. Scores are not released to parents until late summer (and will be delayed even longer this year), making it difficult to utilize the information in a meaningful way. The state must get results to parents more quickly and should continue to expand computer-based testing to speed up the reporting process.\nThe Urban League of Rochester has been working with parents to improve the assessment reporting process and will release a report this May urging the state to better utilize the test to engage parents in the fight for a brighter future for all New York students.\nSebrone Johnson is Senior Director of Innovation at the Urban League of Rochester and Senior Pastor of Greater Harvest Church.

This year, it was thriving, with enrollment more than doubling compared to 2017.\nWhat has changed? The teachers are just as committed, energetic and indefatigable as ever. The students, who come from all walks of life, continue to be just as enthusiastic about learning Hebrew. But there were 49 students enrolled in the program this summer, compared to 20 in 2017.\nOnce word got around that the ulpan may be on the chopping block, community members rallied. A generous donation by Anne Germanacos, a member of the San Francisco Jewish community, ensured the ulpan\u2019s sustainability.\nPotential students who would not have otherwise been able to attend the program were given substantial financial aid. In addition, the teachers and administration capably marketed the program. As a result, the ulpan had its highest enrollment numbers in many years, and once the program began, the quality and strength of the teaching spoke for itself.\nThis year was my second summer in the ulpan. In 2017, I started in kitah alef, where I learned the fundamental basics of Hebrew. When returning for kitah bet (the second level) this summer, I was slightly apprehensive about not having spoken or practiced much Hebrew for a full year. But therein lies the beauty of the ulpan and what sets it apart from other Hebrew language offerings in the Bay Area.\nThe immersive nature of the ulpan (we studied five hours of Hebrew a day for three weeks) is simply the best way to learn. It invites you to step directly into the language and build knowledge cumulatively as opposed to observing it from afar for an hour a week.\nThe rigor and intensity of the program is unparalleled. By the end of my first day in kitah bet, everything I had learned the previous summer came flooding back, which speaks to the quality of the foundational Hebrew I had learned in kitah alef.\nKitah bet was exciting \u2014 the learning of every day (and perhaps even every hour) built upon that of the previous day. Everything was carefully structured while also being immensely fun. The Israeli teachers are phenomenal, bringing decades of experience and engaging with their students in a way that makes them truly love Hebrew.\nThe diversity of the ulpan also adds to its strength. It attracts students from many walks of life \u2014 children, high schoolers, people looking to make aliyah, working professionals and retirees, among others. It is inclusive and friendly, and it is not uncommon for people to build lasting friendships during the program.\nThe shared love of learning Hebrew brings the group together. Increased Hebrew literacy through the ulpan enriches Jewish life in the Bay Area.\nThe class falls under the umbrella of USF\u2019s Jewish Studies and Social Justice program (the only program of its kind in the country that officially links Jewish studies to social justice). Given the success of this summer\u2019s ulpan, the administration is considering the possibility of a winter ulpan, as well, to allow more students to learn Hebrew.\nPersonally, I have found learning Hebrew to be like opening a set of doors to a whole new form of literacy. It can help in shul, in travel to Israel, in feeling connected to the community or just for the sheer joy of learning a new language."}

Before that happens, officials want to hear what residents think about it.\nMeetings will be held in different schools on Thursday and next week to provide that opportunity. According to the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District, that's its way of being proactive to find out how the public feels, rather than waiting until cuts are certain to make the tough calls.\nKPBSD wrote in a release Thursday that those conversations are important for determining the district's future, and listed dates and locations for residents to attend.\n\"With fiscal uncertainty at the state and borough levels, it is an act of due diligence to have the conversations in order to learn community concerns and thoughts,\" Pegge Erkeneff, spokesperson for KPBSD, wrote in the release. \"KPBSD is being proactive to explore a number of possibilities to meet potentially significant funding cuts in all areas of our district, including southern, central, and eastern peninsula schools.\"\nThe budget in question was proposed by Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy, and has been called significant in depth for schools not only in the Kenai Peninsula Borough, but also across the state.\n\"It is unlikely that school closures would occur in the Seward or Homer area as fast as the 2019-2020 school year, unless the Governor\u2019s proposed budget stands,\" the release states. \"Timing of any potential school consolidations in the Seward or Homer areas is unknown, and at this time, school closures or consolidations would be dependent upon funding from the state in FY20 and beyond.\"\nThree meetings were announced for impacted areas of the borough, including Seward, Soldotna and Homer.\nThe Seward meeting will be on April 11, 2019, 6:30 p.m., William H. Seward Elementary School. Officials say the potential closure will be consolidating Seward Middle School (6-8) into Seward High School (9-12), and William H. Seward Elementary (6th).\nKPBSD said this merge would mean a saving of $409,000 in operating costs.\nThe Soldotna-area meeting will be held April 11, 2019, 6:00 p.m. at the Soldotna High School auditorium.\nThe proposed consolidation in Soldotna is to move Soldotna ninth grade students from Soldotna Prep to Soldotna High School, and to relocate River City Academy.\nThe moves would save the district approximately $630,000 each year.\nThe Homer meeting will be held on April 15, 2019, 6:00 p.m., Homer High School commons.

The EU executive has never taken this step since it was given beefed-up powers in 2013.\nThe League and 5-Star say they will not backtrack, arguing that their big-spending budget is needed to boost growth and tackle rising poverty in the euro zone\u2019s third largest but most sluggish economy.\n\u201cThis budget keeps the government\u2019s promises while keeping public accounts in order,\u201d Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after the cabinet meeting, flanked by his top ministers.\nIts key measures include a basic income for the poor, a partial amnesty for citizens who settle tax disputes with the authorities, and tax cuts for the self-employed.\nThe Commission says the budget will push up Italy\u2019s public debt which stood at 131 percent of GDP last year, the highest in the euro zone after Greece\u2019s. It rejects Rome\u2019s argument that the package can lower debt by expanding the economy.\nItaly\u2019s fiscal plans have pushed up the yield on Italian government bonds, raising borrowing costs for state coffers and creating fears of contagion for the broader euro zone, but Tria brushed off concerns.\nThe 70-year old economics professor, unaffiliated to either ruling party, had pushed for a lower deficit target but was overruled by party chiefs, triggering reports that he planned to resign after the budget is approved by parliament. He denied this on Monday.\nFive-Star leader and Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the basic income, his party\u2019s flagship policy which will cost some 10 billion euros (\u00a38.8 billion) next year, will kick off before the end of March.\nTo help fund spending measures, the budget makes life harder for Italy\u2019s struggling banks, reducing the proportion of interest payments they can deduct from their taxable income.\nWhile attracting international criticism, the budget is popular with Italians. A survey by pollster Demopolis on Friday showed 52 percent backed the plan, compared with 38 percent who gave it the thumbs down.\nThe spread between the yield on Italy\u2019s benchmark 10-year bonds and their German equivalent stood at just over 3 percent on Monday, broadly stable compared with the end of last week."}

Fed-up and fatigued, we search for solace. We ask, with good reason I think, what our national broadcaster is doing to help.\nThe Great Canadian Baking Show (Wednesday, CBC, 8 p.m. ET) is what it's doing. It's the much-hyped local version of The Great British Bake Off, obviously. Knock offs of such a culture-specific phenomenon aren't easy. A good part of the charm of the original BBC series (now airing on a commercial channel over there) is the unstinting, unembarrassed Britishness of it. The setting is a tent in the countryside and the Union Jack is everywhere on it. People who missed Downton Abbey fell hard for it, if you know what I mean.\nThe CBC version is very much a literal, copycat iteration. There's a tent-like structure and the bakers toil away there. Pennants adorned with the maple leaf sit where the Union Jack sits on the original. If you're a fan of The Great British Bake Off, you will not feel bamboozled, but you might feel bewildered by the reverential copying.\nHosting duties have, inexplicably, been handed to Dan Levy of Schitt's Creek and British actor Julia Chan, who was on CTV's Saving Hope under the name Julia Taylor Ross. CBC's devotion to Dan Levy must be required by the CRTC or something. Chan does a formidably twee voiceover introduction to things, and the same twee twist on things occurs at regular intervals. This gambit is, I suspect, a silly ruse to make the viewers feel they are watching the original in all its tweeness.\nInto the judging roles defined in Britain by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, CBC welcomes Vancouver pastry chef Bruno Feldeisen and Montrealer Rochelle Adonis. Neither is what anyone would call a natural in the reality-TV racket. Both are a tad stiff and nervous and little wonder \u2013 at any moment, they know they might be swarmed by the feyness of Levy and the tweeness of Chan.\nThere is a lot to mock in this overconceptualized, overly imitative show but, of course, the entire concoction rests upon the amateur bakers who compete. The format is essentially non-competitive, though, and the bakers are meant to be ordinary people whose first impulse is to support each other in their endeavours.

NZ, but not Ireland, has control over its own currency, say local analysts.\nA London-based hedge fund manager says New Zealand is like Ireland pre-global financial crisis and it's only a matter of time before the Kiwi dollar plunges.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Stephen Jen, a partner at SLJ Macro Partners and colleague Fatih Yimaz said in a note that while the \"the case for kiwi seems compelling\" the reality is \"quite different\".\n\"New Zealand has severe structural weaknesses that are very similar to those of crisis-hit southern European and southern emerging-market economies. Kiwi may be 20 per cent overvalued,\" the pair said.\nWhile it was easy to tell a good story for the Kiwi, the analysts said, they were not convinced.\n\"The economy has high growth, high terms of trade, and the currency is high-yielding. However, the case for kiwi is, in our view, much less persuasive.\"\nThey told Bloomberg New Zealand's economy resembled those in Europe and the emerging market just before they were engulfed by crisis - \"a growth model based on debt and credit, low savings rates, and current-account deficits\".\nIreland went from Celtic tiger before 2007 to European debt-crisis victim, requesting a 67.5 billion bailout in November 2010 when the near-collapse of its banks meant bond markets were shut to the country.\nBut ASB economist Chris Tennant-Brown said the aspects of the New Zealand economy that were doing well were not debt-funded.\nA key driver of growth this year was expected to be the Canterbury rebuild which was being funded by insurance payouts.\n\"I don't see a risk there from an Ireland-style debt crisis.\"\nWestpac economist Imre Speizer said New Zealand also differed from Ireland and Europe as the New Zealand currency was free-floated and the banking sector had not got itself into trouble in the booming property market.\n\"The comparison to Ireland is debatable. \"Ireland and southern Europe have no control over their exchange rate as they have a common currency.\n\"They don't have this buffer with which their economy can withstand shocks.\"\nSpeizer said New Zealand was susceptible to both downside and upside risks. The biggest downside risks were the potential for a sharp slowdown in China and for the US Federal Reserve's withdrawal of monetary stimulus.\n\"But that would push up the [US] dollar against all currencies - it's not a New Zealand-specific story. It would affect many currencies.\"\nThe London analysts also said facts don't support the image of New Zealand as an agriculture-based economy dominated by dairy, with agriculture accounting for only 5 per cent of the country's total gross domestic product. But Tennant-Brown said GDP only took into account what was happening on the farm. It did not include manufacturing or farm-related sales.\n\"It is one-third of the export story. I can't really understand how they can say the agriculture story is getting overstated.\"\nThe analysts said they saw considerable downside to the kiwi dollar in contrast to the overwhelmingly positive prevailing view in the markets.\n\"While there may be some temporary cyclical factors that may be supportive of the kiwi, there are serious structural demerits that will one day weigh on the kiwi,\" they said.\nSpeizer said he expected the"}

Which Iraqis will be tried, and who will judge them?\nInternational Criminal Court: This one can probably be ruled out\u2014neither the U.S. nor Iraq ever agreed to it. Ironically, it might be legally possible to try British or Australian troops in the ICC for war crimes if they commit any atrocities, since their nations are signatories. U.N. ad hoc tribunal: This is a special international court that has to be mandated by the Security Council\u2014recent examples include courts created to try war criminals from the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Considering the intense misgivings fellow Security Council members like France and Russia have about the war, it is unlikely that the United States will ask them to create a tribunal. And even if they did, there\u2019s another snag if the blue helmets show up\u2014no U.N. court can sentence a war criminal to death. U.S. federal courts: Under the War Crimes Act of 1996, war crimes by or against U.S. citizens can be prosecuted in American federal courts. This option also seems unlikely, however, because many of the crimes likely to be prosecuted involve Iraqi officials assaulting their own citizens.Local Iraqi courts: These might do for small-fry Baath loyalists. After all, the United States will be trying to create a respectable criminal justice system in Iraq, and war criminals would provide useful fodder to get things rolling. But it\u2019s unlikely that any of the regime\u2019s kingpins would face a local court, since there would be too many opportunities for political skullduggery and old allegiances to taint the process.Hybrid courts: All the rage since their success in Sierra Leone, hybrid courts bring together a combination of local and international jurists. The idea is to mix the grass-roots appeal of civil courts with the respectability and fence-mending powers of international courts. This option also allows the United States to involve European jurists without having to go through the United Nations.\nThe flexibility of a hybrid court will be attractive to post-Iraq planners not because of its appeal to international justice but because it will allow the United States to better trade amnesty for information while still satisfying world opinion. Say the United States invades Iraq and raids all the bunkers and palaces but doesn\u2019t find weapons of mass destruction or Saddam Hussein. In that case, the post-war administration\u2019s first priority will be to pump Iraq\u2019s surviving officials for information\u2014a process that could carry over to war crimes courts.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what war crimes are, Explainer has covered this before.\nExplainer thanks Ruth Wedgwood, professor of International Law and Diplomacy at John Hopkins University and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations; David Phillips, deputy director of the Center for Preventative Action and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations; and Reed Brody, special counsel for Human Rights Watch."}

A day after the State of the Union Address, Axelrod offered few specifics of how the president planned to move forward on his call for new investments in technology, education and infrastructure alongside a five-year domestic spending freeze, but signaled there could be a major showdown with Congressional Republicans over how to fund the federal government in a few weeks, perhaps reminiscent of Bill Clinton\u2019s clash with Newt Gingrich in 1995. (You can read the whole transcript over at Daily Kos).\nThe president doesn\u2019t believe that it is enough simply to cut the budget or reduce the debt or reduce the size of government. In the world in which we live, if we do that and don\u2019t educate our citizens and lead the world in that; if we don\u2019t innovate; if we don\u2019t have kind of basic infrastructure that we need to be competitive, then we\u2019re not going to prevail.\nAnd so as we cut, we\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way and make sure that we\u2019re not cutting those very things that are going to allow us to continue to be a dominant economic force and create opportunity for our people.\nAxelrod seemed confident that a debate over these differing approaches to the coming budget, which will be released in mid-February, would work to the administration\u2019s advantage.\nPart of what the President did last night and what he\u2019s doing today in Wisconsin and what he\u2019ll continue to do relentlessly is make the case for this growth agenda, for this strategy, to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the world.\nAnd hopefully there will be public pressure and support on Democrats and Republicans to support this strategy. If you don\u2019t support this strategy, then the question is what is your strategy? What is your strategy for growth?\nI think people are going to be asking that question. And we have an answer.\nAnd presumably Congress is going to then turn their cards over and say how they would do it differently. And we can have a discussion, the American people can participate in that discussion, as to the priorities.\nYou can\u2019t just swirl around in the land of the theoretical forever.\nBeyond the budget, Axelrod promised that Social Security privatization, of the kind proposed by Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, was a \u201cnon-starter,\u201d though he did not unequivocally rule out future cuts to the program.\nIn the long term there are issues on the horizon relative to Social Security. Among younger Americans, there\u2019s a profound suspicion that Social Security isn\u2019t even going to be there. And among older Americans, there\u2019s a great deal of anxiety about tampering with it.\nAnd our goal is to make sure that the program is strong and secure. The president laid out his principles last night, and we\u2019re willing to have a discussion, but those principles are going to inform the discussion.\nThis is a delicate time because I don\u2019t think you want to start pre-negotiating or pre-discussing issues to the point where people say, well, there\u2019s no point in even sitting down and talking about this stuff.\nThere\u2019s not going to be a bipartisan agreement for him to veto.

The next-generation TPS with the optimizer will facilitate the development of clinically optimal treatment plans up to 90 percent faster than before and the delivery of the treatment up to an estimated 50 percent faster than before, affording clinicians more time to expand patient access to the highly precise stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatments the CyberKnife System delivers.\n\"Our hospital was one of the first in the U.S. to provide treatment with the CyberKnife M6\u2122 and InCise\u2122 Multileaf Collimator and we are continuing our legacy of innovation, focused on positively transforming the care we deliver, with the upgrade to the Accuray Precision TPS and CyberKnife VOLO Optimizer,\" said Sujatha Pai, Chief Physicist, Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health. \"One of our goals in moving from the MultiPlan\u00ae TPS to the Accuray Precision TPS and new optimizer was to increase the speed with which we can create and optimize treatment plans, and our experience to date is clearly demonstrating we are achieving this goal. For example, our physicists, Allison Lindsey and Dr. Hong Xiang, say that with Precision they were able to create an optimal prostate plan in just 45 minutes that would have taken 5-6 hours prior to the upgrade. In general, we're finding it is easier to determine the best treatment approach for each patient and it takes us less time to do so, allowing us to provide SBRT and SRS treatments to more patients in need.\"\nThe CyberKnife VOLO Optimizer builds on industry-established treatment planning methods with new tools intended to assist in delivering an exceptional clinical experience. Validated with input from clinical users affiliated with regional and academic centers, the goal of the optimizer is to 1) make planning faster, thus increasing planning throughput and allowing better plans through exploration of trade-offs and 2) improve the treatment delivery throughput. With the CyberKnife VOLO Optimizer, clinicians are expected to realize a substantial reduction in optimization time, enabling them to create plans for multiple cases in the same day, and helping to ensure the optimal treatment plan is created for cancer and neurology cases spanning different diagnoses and tumor sizes.\n\"The new Accuray Precision TPS with CyberKnife VOLO Optimizer represents a major step forward in the evolution of the CyberKnife System in treatment speed, efficiency and ease of use. Clinicians now have an option for delivering the same highly precise radiosurgery treatments they have come to expect with the system more quickly and for a wider range of patient cases,\" said Lionel Hadjadjeba, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer at Accuray. \"We're thrilled with the results of our internal evaluation, which has shown noteworthy reductions in both treatment planning and delivery times compared to other TPS for the CyberKnife\u00ae platform and treatment planning software for other delivery systems.

Kevin Boyle, will hold a news conference today in the state Capitol touting companion legislation to move Election Day from a Tuesday to a Saturday and Sunday.\nIn 1845, Congress set Election Day nationwide as the first Tuesday following the first Monday of November. The date was picked to meet the work and religious demands of a then mostly agrarian society.\nTuesday gave farmers enough travel time to get to and from the polls without interfering with Sunday church services or Wednesday trips to the market.\nThe Boyles argue society has changed so much over 173 years that Tuesday is no longer the best day of the week to hold elections.\nThey cite polling data from adults who say they don\u2019t have time to vote amid work, school and family obligations. Voters, they argue, would have more time to make it to the polls on weekends.\nTheir legislation would move Election Day to the \u201cfirst Saturday and Sunday after the first Friday\u201d in November.\nCongressman Boyle is proposing federal legislation to move the day. Kevin Boyle is doing the same thing at the state level.\n\u201cIn presidential elections from 2000 to 2012, approximately one-fifth of registered voters who did not cast a ballot listed \u2018too busy, conflicting work or school schedule\u2019 as their reason for not voting,\u201d the Boyles wrote.\nIn 2014, the last midterm election, \u201croughly 35 percent of those who were eligible to vote but did not do so listed scheduling conflicts with work or school as their primary reason for not voting,\u201d they wrote.\nIn 2016, the last presidential election, being too busy dropped to third place as a reason for not voting, falling behind dislike of the candidates and a lack of interest in the election, they said.\nIt\u2019s doubtful, however, either bill would ever become law.\nThe late U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York pushed similar legislation for years.

You then learn to appreciate and to help the people who are raising the money and the awareness and the level of knowledge that progressively are making the experience of MS more livable and bearable.\nYou finally find your way through tears and frustration--the same ones Williams shed and vented on Larry King's show--to the endurance and courage that will get you through it. And, yes, to the appreciation that some brave souls are out there finding the slow, sure keys to that endurance.\nMy point for Williams is be careful what you say, because there are people listening. And if you misinform them--and you are doing that--they will suffer.\nIn his article, Williams acknowledges that he follows \"the traditional methods\" of treatment, but he dismisses them, saying, \"The research isn't going to find a cure. It's going for stopgap measures.\" Montel, stopgap measures are a big leap forward from where we were before you joined us.\nHis interview suggests that he has no appreciation of how fortunate he is to have come to his confrontation with MS after all those hundreds of millions of dollars raised for research and assistance had resulted in the identification and development of the ABC drugs--Avonex, Betaseron and Copaxon.\nWhen I was first diagnosed in 1984, there was nothing you could do to affect the course of your disease and alleviate the staggering symptoms of MS. Research, funded in substantial part by the MS Society that Williams seems to resent, took us a long way from \"diagnose and adios,\" the fatalistic, frustrated phrase neurologists used (but not to their patients) in those days.\nThe great thing the ABCs did is empower us against this disease for the first time. Every time we inject whichever medication is identified for us, we are sticking a needle into MS.\nThese reliefs were not brought into the MS"}

So in addition to the monthly phone subscription for a bundle of talk time, SMS and data, you are expected to pay an add-on fee to be on the 4G data network, which is up to four times faster than 3G.\nLike M1 and SingTel, StarHub had been waiving the monthly $10.70 value-added service charge since 4G launched in 2012. But StarHub's move to start charging $2.17 raised the hackles of consumers who viewed it as an extension of \"bait-and-switch\" tactics to drastically slash their mobile data access.\nTelco's 'bait and switch' tactic?\nAfter the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) intervened, all three telcos agreed last Wednesday not to impose the 4G value-added service charge on customers with current contracts.\nBut the heart of the issue remains - how consumers were persuaded to switch from 3G to 4G, and whether it is right to declare 4G an \"extra\" that brings a value-added service charge.\nAll this goes back to 2007 and the game-changing iPhone.\nThe first iPhone did not arrive here but SingTel stole a march on its competitors in 2008 when it won exclusive rights for the second - the iPhone 3G. It was a roaring success, with some consumers here queueing over 12 hours to get one. So when the third iPhone - the 3GS - arrived in December 2009 for all three telcos, StarHub and M1 were determined to get a slice of the action.\nIt was an all-out war as the telcos bumped up the amount of bundled data exponentially to lure consumers.\nChecking e-mail and Facebook entries and Web browsing might keep users under 2GB of data use a month, but video streaming and large file downloads will require more. Streaming an hour of video in high definition alone uses about 1.2GB of data.\nIn that battle for customers, SingTel increased its free 512MB bundled data to 12GB in its entry-level mobile phone plans to match its rivals' offerings. M1 and StarHub even offered unlimited data usage for high- end plans. At the time, 3G network speed was still relatively slow, apps were immature and most consumers would not use up even one-tenth of their free data, the telcos thought.\nBut the hunger for video streaming and finger-swiping apps exploded soon after and telcos were forced to upgrade their mobile network infrastructure, at significant cost, to meet demand. It became clear that the telcos had given out too much data for too little money. None dared to be the first to trim the bloated data bundle, for fear of seeing its customers walk away.\nThe 4G network gave telcos the opportunity to start anew, on their own terms."}

Carter, who on Sunday could become the first African-American to win an Academy Award for costume design through her Afro-futuristic wardrobes in \"Black Panther.\" But before that show, Carter received a career achievement award Tuesday at the 21st annual Costume Designers Guild Awards.\nShe talked about her early years with Spike Lee and her favorite \"Black Panther\" costumes during a recent interview with The Associated Press .\n\"I was so excited about the idea of costume design and how it intersects with art. I really wanted to draw the characters out. I spent a lot of time in my dorm room or once I came out to L.A. in my semi-studio at my drafting table,\" said Carter, who graduated from Hampton in 1982.\nIn her early days, Carter delved into a script and drew characters before knowing the person who would play the role. She did that in her first-ever film, Spike Lee's \"School Daze.\"\n\"My process at the beginning was to go head on into the script and draw out the characters and make them funny,\" said Carter, speaking with sketches from a cross-section of her lifetime work laid out on a table.\nCarter had numerous sketches including Chicken George from \"ROOTS,\" a zoot suit drawing of Malcolm X and a boxing promoter named Sultan from the \"The Great White Hype.\"\n\"This is what I do, this is what I love,\" she said.\nCarter has created costumes of memorable characters from Denzel Washington's Malcom X in \"Malcolm X,\" Spike Lee's Mookie in \"Do the Right Thing\" and Forest Whitaker's Cecil Gaines in \"The Butler.\"\nBut she said her favorite costumes came from \"Black Panther,\" particularly the Dora Milaje, a team of women elite warriors who protected the kingdom of Wakanda. She said the layered wardrobes of the all-female special forces were \"impactful\" and \"powerful.\"\n\"I was very inspired when we did these illustrations,\" said Carter, who worked with six illustrators on the superhero Marvel film. She typically works with one.\n\"You know, it's quite imaginative. Because we had to work in so many different ways and so fast, I'm really proud of these because we were able to create a look and a world in a short amount of time.\"\nThat's the mindset she particularly had while working with Spike Lee.

But in Pipes\u2019 case, the app isn\u2019t about offering you bite-sized summaries, but instead provides feeds of popular articles on the subject matter at hand, as well as tweets, and even the item\u2019s Wikipedia page, for reference.\nAccording to co-founder Vinay Anand, who built Pipes along with Siddarth Goliya and a small team of mainly 20-year-old engineers, Pipes\u2019 backend today crawls data from over 10,000 sources every hour, allowing you to track just about anything.\n\u201cThe two of us really felt the need to personalize news,\u201d explains Anand. \u201cWe really feel that people have specific things they want to track and want to be alerted on it and that\u2019s exactly what Pipes allows you to do,\u201d he says.\nPipes is well-designed and straightforward to set up and use. From the main screen, you just click a plus (\u201c+\u201d) button to add a new pipe (aka, topic). You then enter your search term or keyword, and tap to add it to your homepage. You can also shake your phone for a suggestion of trending pipes to add, which is fun, if a bit less practical.\nAfter adding your topics, each appears in its own section on the main page, waiting to be explored.

While behind-the-scenes staff meetings have occurred, no resolutions have been reached on illegal immigration measures that the House wants and the Senate refused to consider.\nMr. Bush himself earlier called for lawmakers to hurry and finish their negotiations. \"These reforms are necessary to stay ahead of the threats,\" the president said in a Monday campaign speech. \"I urge Congress to act quickly so I can sign them into law.\"\nThe House bill would expand the number of aliens subject to quick deportation by increasing the amount of time they would have to be in the United States to be exempted from speedy deportation.\nIt also would force asylum seekers accused by their home countries of being involved in terrorist or guerrilla activities to prove that their race, religion, nationality or political opinion will be a \"central reason\" for their persecution if deported.\n\"The administration strongly opposes the overbroad expansion of expedited removal authorities, and has concerns about the provision addressing asylum; these sections should be modified or dropped altogether,\" the letter said.\nThe White House provided a copy of the letter to The Associated Press on Tuesday to ensure its side was publicly represented as the legislation becomes entangled in election-season politics.\n\"This is a blueprint and a path to a bill the president could sign to make our country safer and stronger,\" White House spokesman Trent Duffy said.

They also support the House's anti-terrorism measures, including adding the death penalty as punishment for terrorist murders, mandatory detention for accused terrorists and increased penalties for helping or financing terrorists.\n\"These and other anti-terrorism tools would help keep America safer and help to address the 9/11 commission's recommendations,\" the letter said.\nThe Sept. 11 commission recommended the creation of a national intelligence director position to control almost all of the nation's 15 intelligence agencies, saying the agencies did not work together properly to stop the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York City and Washington.\nCommissioners also called for more safeguards at home, such as setting national standards for driver's licenses and other identification, improving \"no-fly\" and other terrorist watch lists and using more biometric identifiers to screen travelers at ports and borders.\nThe House and Senate passed differing bills addressing those concerns, and must negotiate a compromise to have any hope of getting anything to Mr. Bush before the elections.

That was the case at Mandy and Aru Manrique's first home, a two-bedroom condo in a two-family in West Somerville. Since they moved into the unit in August 2006, the young couple had found innovative and inexpensive ways to redecorate the living room, dining room, and master bedroom themselves, but their solution for the spare room was to keep the door closed.\n\"We have done nothing to this room, besides move stuff into it from the other rooms as we worked on them. It is the catchall for everything in the house that does not have a home,\" Mandy, 28, explains. \"I have been struggling with how to make it a functional and beautiful space.\"\nThe Manriques needed the impossible: a complete decor overhaul on the cheap. The Globe Magazine decided to help. We gave two master of interior design candidates at Boston Architectural College - Becky Boyer, 29, and Melinda Cabanilla, 32 - $500 to transform the couple's cluttered \"catchall\" room into a welcoming place for guests. \"A lot of people say you can't do a makeover for $500,\" says Cabanilla, who practices frugal design in her own apartment. \"Students like us, we can do it on a budget.\"\nThere were a few obstacles. First, the designers decided that most of the room's existing furniture, including a bureau and shelves, would have to go. The height of those pieces and the positioning of others, like the sleeper sofa, made the room appear smaller than it was, Boyer explains. Dominant hues of blue and gray made the space seem dark, too. \"You didn't want to be in here,\" Cabanilla adds.\n\"Our goal was to work with the space to try to make something interesting for them, because they have a really great little apartment,\" Boyer says. \"We wanted to keep the fact that it was a guest bedroom, and also make it a den-type space to relax.\"\nBoyer and Cabanilla discovered some suitable accessories - such as a large mirror - hidden in the couple's storage areas. They also added a few newer items, like wooden shelves from IKEA that mount to the wall to save on floor space. The final, redesigned room includes all of these pieces set off by walls newly painted light beige, one of which has a barely perceptible metallic glaze on it that adds a golden glow to the room.\nThe couple's pull-out couch, once crammed against the wall, is now positioned at an angle, opening up the room and making it feel larger. Chartreuse-colored Flor carpet tiles, bold wall art, and throw pillows sewn by Cabanilla add bursts of color to the space. And funky accessories - like a small container decorated with a dog's face that bears a striking resemblance to the Manriques' English bulldog, Tank - personalize it. The result is a combination of Cabanilla's eclectic tastes and Boyer's modern design aesthetic. But, perhaps most important, the room seems to fulfill the owners' needs.\n\"I really love the layout of the space; it's so much more inviting and comfortable,\" Mandy says. \"I also love the new furniture,"}

The post came from Children's Medical Missions West, a nonprofit that helps transport children around the world to receive free medical care for rare conditions and issues.\nSwabb saw a photo of baby Dominique on her mother's lap. \"That photo really captured my heart,\" Swabb said. \"She looked so sweet.\"\nThe nonprofit has asked CNN not to include Dominique's last name for privacy reasons.\nDominique had a twin, but she never fully developed, instead fusing with her in the womb. She was born with what is known as a parasitic twin, where the underdeveloped twin formed incompletely and was entirely dependent on Dominique's body.\nShe was born with her parasitic twin's waist, legs and feet growing out of her back. Dominique was also born with two spines that were closely connected. Cases of parasitic twins are so rare that most of them are known by the names of the patients.\nWithout surgery to remove the parasitic twin, Dominique's life would not be a very long one. Her tiny heart and lungs were working to support the equivalent of two bodies. The mass of kicking legs attached to her neck and back would continue to grow, causing deformity, abnormal forces on the spine and a life of pain, doctors said.\nBut the complicated surgery would have to be done at a hospital equipped to handle the risks, and Dominique would need a foster family to help her get through it.\nSwabb, a native Chicagoan, realized that the Park Ridge, Illinois address belonged to Adovcate Children's Hospital, only about 7 miles from her family's home. She and her husband, Tim, knew they could help and reached out.\nThey went through a vetting process and confirmed that they would be able to take Dominique to all of her appointments at the hospital, which had been scheduled through the organization.\nChildren's Medical Missions West had raised funds for Dominique's flight, in which she would be escorted by a flight attendant who donated her time.\nBut the family, which has two adopted daughters -- Lena, 15, and Mara, 9 -- realized they still needed to make ready for Dominique's arrival.\nSwabb, a special events coordinator, asked her neighbors in the family-filled Edgebrook community whether they could borrow anything for the baby they would be fostering. Within two days, a pile taller than Swabb herself filled the house. Neighbors eagerly donated packages of diapers, formula, wipes, clothes, a stroller, a car seat and a playpen. Mara and her friends organized all of the items in the family's basement to make them easily accessible.\nBaby Dominique arrived to a warm reception three days later, on February 5.\nSwabb's daughters were thrilled to have a new baby in the house. Mara seemed to bond with Dominique almost instantly, and they enjoyed making each other laugh.\n\"Baby Dominique is so affectionate and receives love so well, so we knew right away that she comes from a loving family,\" Swabb said. \"She's bubbly, funny, spirited, full of smiles, and has the brightest, happy eyes.\"\nSwabb's daily walks with Dominique"}

{"idx": "9078", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Different grades of wool bring different prices at market.\nWool production is an agricultural activity that can serve as the basis for a small business in which growing high-quality wool is the focus or as a by-product of a meat production operation, in which lower-quality wool comes from sheep intended for market. Traditionally, small wool-producing operations come together to produce a wool pool, in which wool is sold collectively to a wool warehouse or mill for processing, sale and distribution. Other wool operators sell their product directly to consumers, who include weavers, spinners and yarn-makers.\nDetermine the quality of your wool. Various characteristics of wool dictate its uses, and therefore, its potential market. Wool is categorized by its fiber diameter or fineness, its crimp or wave, its color, uniformity, staple length, and strength. The most valuable wool is fine, long-stapled, crimped, light-colored fiber with little variation.\nLocate a wool pool in which you collectively sell your wool with other wool producers, as well as a wool mill, where you sell your wool direct, and compare prices and services (see Resources). Some wool buyers want only cleaned, packaged raw wool, while others prefer straight-from-the-sheep shearings that include lanolin, or wool grease.\nIdentify niche markets for selling raw wool direct. This includes high-quality yarn and fiber manufacturers, independent wool spinners or fiber artists. Typically, wool hand-spinners prefer long, fleeced wools, while blanket-makers will use lower-quality wools that they blend with other fibers.\nExpand your selling market by adding a level of processing to raw wool. Washing, cleaning, and combing or flattening wool or spinning it into yarn makes the raw wool marketable to a wider audience that includes clothing, rug- and quilt-makers.\nIn a commercial wool market, light-colored fibers are considered more valuable because of their ability to accept dyes, but many artists and yarn-makers prefer natural and dark wool colors.\nAvoid wool contamination, which lowers wool's market value. Examples of contamination include excess weathering, permanent branding ink and poly contamination, in which wool comes in regular contact with materials containing polypropylene, such as bedding, flooring, feed bags and bundling twine.\nMcQuerrey, Lisa. \"How to Sell Raw Wool.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/sell-raw-wool-17395.html.

He was born in Honolulu on January 6, 1938. After a long career rising up to the rank of Nuclear Supervisor at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Howard maintained an active retirement pursuing his lifelong interest in firearms, tinkering in his garage making things for the house, gambling trips to Las Vegas and in her time of need, caring for his wife of 46 years, Frances Mayumi (Kuwahara) Lau. Howard was a strong, opinionated, honest and straightforward man, never afraid to tell you what he wanted and expected of others and of himself. Direct and determined, once he decided to get something done, his extraordinary mechanical creativity and vision allowed him to fix, make or modify everything from a protective cage for his prized Hawaiian chili peppers to a custom 9-person poker table. He designed and made countless things in his garage in Pearl City where the family lived from 1973 to 2015. While Howard was satisfied with saying more with few words, he was deeply and fiercely devoted to his loved ones, preferring to communicate more by action and deed, including the many heartfelt cards he frequently sent out to his family and friends across the state and on the Mainland. Howard is survived by his son, Kenneth, daughter Tammy, daughter-in-law Jennifer Ayers, brothers Warren (Bobbie) and Calvin (Sharon) and sisters Barbara (Ronald) Okada and Lorraine (Dexter) Chin as well as nine nieces and nephews and their respective families. He was predeceased by wife Frances, parents Edward and Ellen Lau and sister Pat (Craig) Nakayama. Howard's doctors deserve to be thanked publicly for their many years of care and concern. No one could have had better doctors, especially Dr. Jeffrey Chung, Dr. Randall Nitta, Dr. Deborah Glenn, Dr. Michael Chun, Dr. Ken Arakawa, Dr. Jared Sugimoto, Dr. Kalani Yamamoto, Dr. Troy Tanji, Dr. Abhijeet Koli, Dr. Glenn Wong, Dr. Stephen Lee, Dr. John Cho, Dr. Jeffrey Wong and Dr. Laura Miller. The family also wishes to acknowledge the caring assistance and expert support provided by St. Francis Hospice, in particular, Dr. Naomi Morita, social worker Maty Beasley and hospice nurse Emma Vicente. A special thank you to all the staff at the 'Ilima at Leihano for their extraordinary kindness and kokua for the family until the end and afterwards.

However, Lynn Sherman\u2014executive vice president of finance, IT and capital projects with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center\u2014said that the exact renderings are not yet final.

And it's also been documented that kids who cook choose healthier foods.\nWith all those holiday parties coming up, and plenty of food prep to go with it, now may be the perfect time to get your children cooking. Not only will it teach them an important life skill, but it also gives them an opportunity to create something they can show off in front of family and friends. Given we tend to have crazy schedules over the holidays, cooking together is also a rare opportunity for some true quality time.\nBut as anybody who has actually cooked with kids knows, more hands don't necessarily mean less work. (And they certainly don't ensure less mess!) Below are some strategies for holiday cooking with children, without losing your mind.\nIf you are rushing to get a dish prepared for a holiday potluck and you're leaving in an hour, now may not be the ideal time to get the kids involved. By planning ahead, and carving out some quality time for kid-centric cooking, you can make sure you have time to really focus on the little ones and enjoy what you are creating.\nWith younger children, your goal is really to just get them experiencing food and cooking \u2014 not creating the perfect dish. So why not put a little of whatever recipe you are working on and let them experiment with whatever ingredients you have to hand? Chances are, you'll have a culinary disaster \u2014 but your aspiring chef will have a blast creating it. For older children, you could ask them to pick out a recipe of their choice and make it fully themselves.\nIt goes without saying that kitchen tasks should be divvied out according to age and ability. For 3- to 4-year-olds, have them help mix and pour ingredients, and expect them to get bored quickly. But 4- to 6-year-olds will most likely get into rolling out cookie dough, cutting out cookies, and maybe chopping ingredients with a safe, plastic knife. Around age 9 and onwards, children will be ready to start learning how to use the microwave and maybe even the stove. But be sure to supervise very carefully until you know they are competent and safe.\nCooking, like many creative activities, is an opportunity to learn about all kinds of things. As a registered dietitian, I love to talk to my kids about the nutritional value of the foods they are preparing (including why sugary treats are a \"less often\" food!). But you can also talk about where their food comes from, who grew/raised it, and perhaps learn some math through the basics of weights and measures too."}

{"idx": "9091", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When it comes to improving study time, finding roommates, communicating with professors and registering for classes, students have solidly integrated technology into their educational experience.\nNow, smart technology is quickly becoming another strong tool in helping students with their educational experience, whether it\u2019s using smart boards in the classroom or saving money on energy costs that could better be put toward tuition. Here are some ways smart technology is changing the way students live and learn.\nHave you considered smart technology in your apartment or home? Many new apartment complexes and even dorms are incorporating the ability to add smart tech gadgets like programmable thermostats and smart lighting. This technology is just one way to improve energy savings by keeping heating, lighting and other functions automatically regulated to your school schedule. Why keep your apartment toasty or the lights burning while you\u2019re in class? The money you save on utilities could go towards student loans, rent, and anything else you need.\nHigh-efficiency light bulbs in your desktop lamps can help illuminate your study time properly while also avoiding the higher costs of incandescents while you\u2019re burning the midnight oil. Some smart lights can adjust to block out blue light at night or even emit aromatherapy scents so you can get the quality sleep you need before that big exam. And these smart lights can change colors to create the right atmosphere for when it\u2019s time to invite your friends over to celebrate your success.\nAdditionally, you can turn any appliance into a smart appliance with a smart plug or power strip that can be controlled via app\u2014it\u2019s a great way to get your coffee maker going for those quick pre-class review sessions, set the timer on the TV to make sure you limit break time and get plenty of studying in.\nSmart tech in school buildings.\nSmart technology that conserves energy is being incorporated into classrooms as well, cutting the costs of building maintenance and operations and letting universities focus the savings elsewhere. Sensors can help maintenance staff predict repairs before they\u2019re needed by keeping up with preventive replacements and upgrades. Smart HVAC systems can keep temperatures regulated for a comfortable learning environment. Smart security systems can help protect school grounds by only allowing access to registered students, faculty and staff, creating a safer space for students.\nSmart lighting technology can keep unused classrooms dark and adjust depending on natural light sources, and considering that lighting classrooms is typically one of the biggest costs for universities, it can result in thousands of dollars better diverted elsewhere. Not only can LED lighting improve costs, it also has been shown to help students improve their test scores, cognitive skills and productivity, particularly when the lighting can be adjusted between cool and warm lighting that better emulates natural daylight.\nSmart tech also includes smart classroom design, such as capturing more of that natural daylight to enhance both energy efficiency and student alertness, and in functional furniture that can be easily moved and reconfigured for small-group learning. Flexibility is the key\u2014the ability to adjust lighting for better screen viewing, to move around desks and chairs to create small-group conferences, and to offer ways to integrate technology are all ways smart design will enhance learning.\nSmart tech in the classroom.\nLearning has never been more accessible to students.

There is room for smaller competitors which can ride on developing markets' shift toward advanced mobile handsets to become a sustainable business too, two OS makers say.\nCaroline Kempf, spokesperson for Jolla, pointed out that the smartphone industry is showing such fast pace in terms of changes, with companies coming and going and different device categories emerging and disappearing, there are no mature markets worldwide currently.\nMost of the smartphone markets continue to evolve as consumer preferences change and business models adapting to meet their needs, Kempf added. So, using an emerging market such as China as an example, its large population would easily sustain Jolla in terms of potential investments and research & development opportunities.\nThese resources, in turn, would allow the Finnish startup to grow and \"launch a serious contestant\" in the existing smartphone OS arena, she added.\nJolla announced earlier in July it would continue Nokia's work on the Linux-based MeeGo OS , which was dumped by the latter after it decided to use Microsoft's Windows Phone OS on its smartphones. It also inked a sales and distribution deal with Chinese retail chain D.Phone Group , with Jolla chairman Antti Saarnio saying the agreement is a major step toward the company's journey to become a significant player in the global smartphone market.\nAnother new smartphone OS developer, Mozilla Foundation, also indicated its intentions to target emerging markets , with Brazil expected to be the first market to receive smartphones powered by its Firefox OS.\nBrendan Eich, CTO of Mozilla Foundation, told ZDNet Asia that the idea behind creating Firefox OS is to be able to deliver compelling smartphone experiences at attainable prices. A greater number of people, specifically those in developing markets, would then be able to adopt smartphone devices, he said, adding it will continue to \"keep an eye\" on developed markets as well.\n\"It's important to emphasize that this initiative is not about bringing even cheaper smartphones to market; it's about delivering a better performance on devices, especially those that are at the low price point end of the devices market,\" Eich stated.\nHe added the operating system is based on many new open standards pioneered by Mozilla and it intends to integrate HTML 5 to more of a handset's underlying functions. This will help the organization, together with its telco partners such as Vivo, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, and Telenor, to bring the smartphones to emerging markets currently dominated by feature phones, the CTO noted.\n\"iOS and Android devices do not currently cater for this market and we don't believe they will in the future either,\" he added.\nResearch firm IDC predicted in March that emerging markets will drive growth in global smartphone shipments , with China surpassing United States to take the lead in 2012 and India and Brazil entering the top 5 list by 2016. These markets have their sheer size, strong demand, and healthy device replacement rate to thank for their rising prominence, it noted."}

If you are an owner-occupant residing in your residence, such as a condominium or townhouse, your monthly homeowner association dues are non-deductible personal expenses.\nHowever, if you rent the residence to tenants, then the monthly homeowner association dues are tax-deductible \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d expenses. You should report those dues payments on Schedule E of your income tax returns, the same place you report the rental income received. For more details, please consult your tax adviser.\nDEAR BOB: Five years ago, my husband and I signed for a mortgage so our son and daughter-in-law could buy a house in upstate New York.

I don\u2019t think they can qualify for their own mortgage and we cannot afford to pay it off. What should we do? \u2013 Terry U.\nDEAR TERRY: Getting your names off the title to the house is easy. All you do is execute a quit claim deed to your son and daughter-in-law. Then record it in the county or city where the house is located.\nHowever, getting your names off the mortgage is virtually impossible. Mortgage lenders are extremely reluctant to release co-borrowers from the mortgage note.\nThe reason is, in the event of default, depending on the type of mortgage and state law, if a foreclosure loss results, the lender might be able to obtain a deficiency judgment against you. More details are available from a real estate attorney where the property is located.\nDEAR BOB: We recently bought a condo on Maui. Can you recommend any book that will clarify the tax situation for our personal and rental use of the condo? \u2013 Peter B.\nDEAR PETER: There are four possible tax situations: (1) no personal use time, (2) under 14 days of annual personal use, (3) annual personal use over 14 days or 10 percent of the rental days, and (4) annual personal use under 15 days or 10 percent of the rental days.\nSecond or vacation homes generally are not great tax shelters whether or not you rent to tenants for part of the year.

The designs and operations playbooks of these new centers aim to lower costs, increase reliability and maintainability, and improve agility, while reducing energy use and carbon footprint.\nAs big data and cloud computing push the limits of traditional datacenters, new trends in datacenter innovation have followed. Google started the ball rolling when it scaled up its search operations starting in the late 1990s. By 2001, Google, still three years away from its IPO, was building its own servers from piece-parts, seeking not only economy but also reliability and ease of maintenance. Prior to 2003, Google was investigating putting large numbers of servers in a shipping container. That year it applied for a patent on the idea of the modular, drop-in-place datacenter.\nBack then, Google was saying very little about its datacenter operations. A favorite Silicon Valley guessing game was to speculate on how many servers the company ran. The search giant was gradually forced into more transparency by the rapid rise of Facebook, which discussed its operations in detail.\nGoogle's containerization patent was issued in 2007; it wasn't until 2009 that the company confirmed that it had been installing modular, containerized server farms since 2005. Google is now quite chatty about its datacenters.\nFacebook built its first from-scratch datacenter in Prineville, Ore., open-sourcing the designs of everything it used -- from servers and storage to networking and even the specifications for datacenters themselves. In April 2011 Facebook announced the Open Compute Project, a non-profit charged with the stewardship of these hardware blueprints.\nAs Microsoft, Apple, and eBay began building large scale, cloud datacenters during the last half decade, they joined the pioneers in looking for ways to reduce energy consumption in their datacenters. Innovative power and cooling schemes multiplied. Soon the competition shifted to green energy: How much of a datacenter's power could be supplied from renewable sources?\nEach of the following cloud-scale datacenters breaks new ground in some dimension of its design or operation -- from modularity and efficiency to scalability and green energy -- and each has something to teach us about how datacenter design is evolving.

When the most trumpeted word in Ghana football \u2013 corruption \u2013 was finally exposed to the public with evidence.\nWhether the method used by Anas was ethical or not, that is a discussion for another day. But one can conclude that the much-talked-about bribery and corruption that has engulfed the game was exposed. Need I not to talk more about the day which when remembered brings chills and sets teeth on edge.\nFast forward after the screening of the investigative piece, one can say without mincing words that truly the foundation of Ghana football has collapsed, prompting the government and FIFA to set up a Normalization Committee (NC) to temporarily run football and sanitize the system. But then I ask how are the concerned and honest journalists who constantly criticized the old administration of the Ghana Football Association led by Kwesi Nyantakyi helping to rebuild Ghana football?\nI hope Anas is keeping tabs on the honest and concerned journalists\u2019 contribution to the rebuilding of Ghana football because I am sorry to announce to him that most of them are now playing \u2018politics\u2019 with the game.

The guidebook will glean information from literature reviews, stakeholder conversations, focus groups and an online survey that launched earlier this week at cuboulder.qualtrics.com/menu/npca.\nThe presentation and conversation touched on several different topics, outlined below in nine key takeaways. But the overall conversation centered on what is driving millennials to recreate in the wilderness when these same people may not have ventured there in past generations. And the answer to that question, from both the presenters and attendees, centered on how the variable of social media has changed many of their reasons to go outdoors.\n1) \u201cAdrenaline movement\u201d \u2014 That was the term Mazal used to describe how many millenials are seeking to go to places or attempt things in the outdoors that may be against the law, unsafe or out of their comfort zone.\nDuring the discussion, attendees asked if and how things such as adventure films and videos and online contests or challenges may be encouraging millenials to attempt these things.\n\u201cPerception of this kind of lifestyle they want to live is a lot of what drives these bad ethics,\u201d one attendee said, \u201cand have you considered the use of thought leaders in millenials?\n2) Geologic graffiti \u2014 The students relayed that several stakeholders they spoke with mentioned how graffiti on natural surfaces and rocks at national parks is on the rise in the Southwest.\nThis reality echoed the sentiment through the discussion that many millennial recreationalists new to the outdoors within the past decade simply don\u2019t know proper wilderness ethics, as demonstrated by the following anecdote from a hike to Half Dome in Yosemite National Park.\n3) How to humor \u2014 Focus group research suggested millenials will listen with a humorous message, though that message should be fully comedic and, if necessary, even a bit crass.\n4) Leave \u201cLeave No Trace\u201d behind? \u2014 Toward the end of the session, one attendee suggested programs such as Leave No Trace, with its detailed seven principles, are simply too much for most millenials to digest before a maiden trip to the wilderness.\n\u201cMessaging has to be shorter, faster, precise, not ambigous,\u201d the attendee said.\n5) Instagram is greater than Facebook \u2014 Mazal and the CU students were adamant that if the land management agency representatives in the room were targeting their millennial audiences via Facebook, to redirect those efforts to Instagram.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a starting place before they look into further where they\u2019d like to go,\u201d Hasovec said.\n6) Selecting signage \u2014 The group said they were surprised to find that simple signage deterred millenials better than more complicated, even artistic signs.\n7) No more cereal boxes \u2014"}

It\u2019s a genre movie from a first-time American director who submitted his film on a whim and was amazed to find that he\u2019d been accepted.\nHis film is about a shy black teenager, Milo, in a poor New York City neighborhood.

{"idx": "9116", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The novelist and sometime phil?o?sopher Walker Percy used to say that Angelism-by which he meant the denial of our bodily nature-is the defining heresy of modernity. The great French political theorist Pierre Manent seems to be getting at something similar in his new book, A World Beyond Politics? A Defense of the Nation-State, when he argues that moderns aspire to anchor all bonds and obligations in a purely spiritual decision, freefrom antecedent bodily conditions.\nManent sees modernity as a quest for freedom from all sources of obligation extrinsic to the human will. In Kantian terms, freedom becomes autonomy, the capacity to give oneself the law and thus to be liberated from heteronomy. In contemporary politics, particularly in Europe, the most potent movements aspire to a pure democracy purged of any ties to history, place, or language-all the embodied features of the political order that have been with us since the origin of the Greek polis. In Manent\u2019s telling, the tragic structure of the history of mankind\u2019s alienation from the polis is instructive concerning the enduring nature of the human and the limits to the modern project of mastering nature.\nA World Beyond Politics? is the third of Manent\u2019s books to be published in the Princeton series New French Thought, following An Intellectual History of Liberalism and The City of Man. A student of Raymond Aron and heavily influenced by Leo Strauss, Manent deftly weaves detailed exegesis of texts within an historical analysis of pagan, Christian, and modern epochs. The English title of the latest book is somewhat misleading, as the text is less a defense of the nation-state than a plea to treat the nation-state in particular, and political phenomena in general, as worthy objects of understanding.\nApplying Aristotle\u2019s Politics to our current situation, Manent attempts an account of regimes, particularly of the nation-state as a regime that arose out of previous conceptions and that may in the not-too-distant future give way to some supernational form of political life. But would that even be a political life in any meaningful sense? Or would it offer entrance into a world beyond politics, as the title wonders? And what would a life beyond politics mean for human nature and philosophy, both of which are discovered along with the conscious articulation of the nature of politics, with the birth of the polis?\nfor any geographical definition of Europe whatsoever.\nThe problem for Europe is that it does not know what, if anything, its member nations and various people share. For clarification, Manent returns us to Aristotle\u2019s assertion that citizens hold \u0093words and deeds in common.\u0094 Manent\u2019s genealogy of modern politics begins with the Greeks and the polis; the city is the most natural form of government. In the early modern period, a new, more abstract and more formal conception of politics comes to the fore. The medieval identification of the people with the presence of the king\u2019s body-concrete, tangible, and visible-becomes replaced by modern notions of representation and the multiplication of interests, of politics as abstract, intangible, and invisible.\nCitizens of modern regimes suffer varying degrees of frustration over the absence of any visible presence of their unity; there is no place where modern human beings experience wholeness. One of the attractions of totalitarianism, which Manent predicts will remain an ongoing temptation, is that it promises to overcome the sense of dislocation and fragmentation by supplying a visibly unified political life. Many modern political theorists had predicted that the"}

{"idx": "9119", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Why won\u2019t our leaders talk about what we\u2019re doing there?\nLast Tuesday, Liberal prime minister Paul Martin made his pre-election stop in Victoria, meeting with supporters at a rally at the Hotel Grand Pacific. There, in what must have felt like a strange replay of countless such events across the country as we head towards the January 23 election, Martin delivered a short speech with a few feel-good messages and several attacks on conservative leader Stephen Harper. Harper, he says, would integrate our country even more deeply with the United States\u2014something many Canadians don\u2019t want to see happen.\nAnd yet, one particular aspect of Canada\u2019s foreign affairs points to exactly that sort of integration with the States. Our recent dubious record in Haiti, and our role in Afghanistan, was something Martin didn\u2019t mention, and there was no opportunity for reporters to ask about.\nIn fact, there has been little mention of Haiti in the entire tightly managed campaign so far, even though Mark Bourque, a retired Canadian RCMP officer, died there in recent weeks, shot in the streets of Port au Prince. Not even the suicide this weekend of Urano Texeira da Matta Bacellar, the Brazilian leader of the UN forces in Haiti, caused a blip in Canadian political circles. Nor has the steady criticism from peace activists who question Canada\u2019s involvement in either country.\nThe election should include a close analysis of Canada\u2019s foreign policy, Anderson says, and yet, the closest we\u2019ve come during this campaign is politicians talking about increasing the size of the armed forces. How, Anderson asks, can we talk about that without saying what we\u2019d be increasing the forces for?\nAnd yet, the question remains for many Canadians: Just what is Canada doing in Haiti, and why is it a problem?\nOver the past several months, Clarke and the coalition have been trying to raise awareness of the issue. They\u2019ve brought a couple of speakers to Victoria, including the journalist Kevin Pina, who is from Oakland, California, but has lived for several years in Haiti, is married to a Haitian and has a child there.\nAsked what Canadians need to know about Haiti, Pina says, \u201cThat your government is investing millions of dollars in an unelected, undemocratic regime.\u201d Also, he says, on this one Canada is in \u201clock step\u201d with the United States. And, oh yes, the decision to unseat Aristide, known as the Ottawa initiative, was made in Canada.\nWhether or not Haitians get to participate in a free election anytime soon in their own country, the election that\u2019s currently happening here could determine whether there\u2019ll be a shift in our involvement there. So what do representatives of Canada\u2019s various political parties think, and why aren\u2019t they giving the Liberals a rougher ride on their Haiti record?\n\u201cWe are very concerned obviously with developments in Haiti,\u201d says Stockwell Day, the conservative\u2019s foreign affairs critic, in a voice message. He\u2019s also the MP for Okanagan-Coquihalla and once upon a time lived in Victoria and attended UVic (though it\u2019s not clear from his website whether he actually graduated).

Those wars also deepen the climate crisis because they are themselves major sources of greenhouse gasses.\nSo, in honor of Obama\u2019s Nobel, Stephen Kretzmann of Oil Change International has pulled together this superb analysis of the links between war and climate change.\nTake a look\u2013it\u2019s just one more reason to bring the troops home.\nThe connections between war and warming go deeper than as Alan Greenspan put it, the \u201cpolitically inconvenient\u201d [fact that] \u201ceveryone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.\" When we choose to go to war, that choice means money is no longer available for other things, such as clean energy or funding for communities vulnerable to climate impacts around the world. And the war itself, with all its planes, trucks, missiles, and ships, emits huge amounts of greenhouse gases\u2013that no one tracks.\nThe fact that the Obama administration has already chosen to invest further in war has a rather steep opportunity cost, in addition to its actual cost.\nThe money that has been spent this decade by the American taxpayer on war could instead, had we wanted it to, funded all the needed global investments in clean energy out to 2030.\nThe sums being discussed here in Copenhagen are actually much more modest than the trillions spent recently on war. The United Nations recently estimated that $500 billion would be needed (from all the developed world \u2013 not just the US) to help build a global clean energy economy and to help vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. Oxfam puts it at $200 billion.\nSadly, even these sums aren\u2019t on the table. There is an ongoing discussion of just $10 billion in so-called \"fast track funding\", and of that, the US has pledged \u201cits fair share. Jonathan Pershing, Obama\u2019s Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Change, seems to be arguing that this is only $1.5 billion.\nThat\u2019s right, that would be half of what the Administration just gave Exxon, and a fraction of its ongoing subsidies to fossil fuels.\nThere is currently nothing, nada, zip on the table for long term climate finance.\nObama to World: Drop Dead.\nTurns out that money doesn\u2019t actually grow on trees \u2013 it\u2019s manufactured in weapons factories.\nEmissions from war are more difficult to quantify. On the fifth anniversary of the war, Oil Change International published A Climate of War, a report that quantified the emissions of the war from March 2003 through until December 2007. We used very conservative estimates and left many things out when we couldn\u2019t get reliable numbers, and still the number was staggering.\nThe Iraq war was responsible for at least 141 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) from March 2003 through December 2007.

{"idx": "9122", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There is hope that a new operational model will not only improve service but also increase profits.\nBut before going there, let's take a look at the company's third-quarter performance. In a prior look at the global leader in digital media creation, I commented on how difficult it has been for Wall Street analysts and the company's management for that matter, to accurately forecast how results will turn out. With the release of the earnings report, management has once again revised its full-year estimates, this time downward.\nWall Street didn't welcome the news, sending shares sharply south in recent trading, and for good reason. With the unpredictable nature of Avid's business, in which it is dealing with cutting-edge products that face software stability issues as glitches are worked out, in addition to uncertainties surrounding the timeliness of adoption by customers, it comes as no surprise that the stock performance has been equally unpredictable.\nAs far as the third quarter went, revenues increased 13.1% year over year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, however, organic revenue growth increased about 7%. The top line was supported by continued strength in the professional video segment as media producers continue to move toward HD. Geographically, video sales in Europe and America were solid, both achieving a 9% increase over the same quarter a year ago.\nGross profit margins were 48.4%, significantly below the 53.3% mark it achieved in the year-ago period. Margins in its video business were \"stable\" but more than offset by weaker margins in its audio and consumer segments. We can assume that its Pinnacle acquisition with products more geared to the lower-margin consumer market is one reason for the decline.\nFinally, reflecting various one-time charges, earnings for the quarter were $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $0.48 per share in the comparable period a year ago.\nOne of the first things that stood out for me in the call is very much related to what I have just been commenting on -- the inconsistency in the current business model. I've already mentioned two types of challenges Avid is facing, hindering its ability to accurately forecast revenues.\nAdoption issues are one hurdle, as exemplified in sales for Pro-Tools HD systems that were \"stalled\" by third-party delays in getting the necessary updated plug-ins to run on Intel-based Macs. A second challenge is with the software itself, making sure the system is operable and stable. Pinnacle Studio 10, for example, is a product that Avid has spent some effort on in improving its \"stability.\" Hopefully, this will translate into improved sales.\nBeyond these two factors, there is a third obstacle that Avid must contend with, and that is the ever-increasing complexity of projects needed to address its customer's needs. One analyst asked during the Q&A portion of the call whether some of the issues it is dealing with are of an \"execution\" nature. CEO David Krall stated matter-of-factly that it \"is not related to execution.\" Rather, he added, \"The deal size continues to get larger, and as a consequence of that, the larger the deal, in general, the more complex it is. The more complex it is, the longer it takes to do installation, and also the longer it takes to fully educate and train all of the operators on how to use the new system.\"\nWe can see the direct effect of the phenomena in the company's third-quarter results.

Iowa State coach Matt Campbell snatched him up to help coach the secondary \u2014 which frees up defensive coordinator Jon Heacock. Instead of also overseeing the safeties, Heacock now has become a walk-around coordinator who can spend time with all factions of the defense.\nCaponi knows the successful 3-3-5 defensive scheme Heacock runs, because West Virginia ran it. He and Campbell were teammates at Mount Union, a Division III power in Ohio. It looks like a perfect fit.\nI spoke with Caponi at the same recruiting function a couple weeks ago, and while we chatted on one side of the large room at the Sukup End Zone Club, the Cyclones\u2019 most surprising success story on the 2018 roster was signing autographs on the other.\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get to see Brock a whole lot before we played them, but from what we saw, we knew our hands would be full,\u201d Caponi said.\nAs it turned out, every opposing defensive coach had his hands full trying to plot successful strategy against the guy who didn\u2019t even get to Ames until last June.\nThe only non-high school video available to Caponi and the West Virginia defensive staff was Purdy\u2019s 3\u00bd quarters of wonderfulness the previous Saturday at Oklahoma State.

There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about the attack on Sony Pictures and those behind it.\nAfter two weeks of investigations, anonymous government officials told some reporters and politicians on Wednesday that North Korea was behind the attacks. But on Thursday, U.S. officials resisted making the same allegations in public and didn\u2019t release any evidence to back up the anonymous claims.\nNorth Korean involvement is certainly possible. After all, defectors have spoken about North Korea\u2019s cyber attack force and training. But it also plays into a popular and easy-to-believe narrative about the country.\nThere certainly appears to be circumstantial evidence, but it could be just that. So before calling case closed, here are some reasons to be wary, at least until some evidence is made public.\nNorth Korea has been blamed for a string of hacks in the past, and it\u2019s generally accepted that the country has the capability to hack and attack companies. But no previous attack attributed to North Korea\u2014or any nation-state\u2014has been so public and so noisy. In the past, attacks happened, North Korea was suspected, and then sometimes the country was later blamed. It rarely said anything, except for an initial denial. This time around, the hacker group has posted messages online taunting Sony and telling the FBI they cannot be caught. Early on, they were also interacting with reporters.\nIt is, however, very similar to plenty of hacker activist attacks made against major corporations and governments and\u2014it\u2019s worth noting\u2014against North Korean Internet sites in May 2013. In those attacks, thousands of user names and passwords for North Korean news site \u201cUriminzokkiri\u201d were leaked by hackers operating under the \u201cAnonymous\u201d banner.\nIf the hack was all about stopping the release of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d why didn\u2019t that come up earlier? For the first couple of weeks, the messages that accompanied leaked data didn\u2019t mention the movie at all. It was much more about Sony and its executives\u2014something underlined by the vindictiveness of the leaks.\nThe movie wasn\u2019t mentioned until a message on Dec. 8, and then it was in addition to previous demands made by the group.\nThe movie wasn\u2019t mentioned by name until Dec. 10, when the hackers also issued their threat to movie theaters.\nIf you don\u2019t follow North Korea closely\u2014and few do\u2014you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that\u2019s a pretty damning statement of intention. But such threats are business as usual for North Korea.\nBecause not a lot is known about North Korea, things that really should be questioned are sometimes taken as fact because they neatly fit into the box where many people place North Korean behavior: weird with a touch of crazy.\nTake the death of Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Un\u2019s uncle, who was removed in a purge a year ago. A report, eventually traced back to a Chinese satirical website, said he had been killed by being stripped naked and fed to a pack of ravenous dogs. Newspapers jumped on the story without questioning its source, and it made global headlines for a day until cooler minds noted he was probably killed by a firing squad.\nAnd then there was Kim Jong Un\u2019s former girlfriend, Hyon Song Wol, who, according to newspaper headlines in late 2013, had also been purged and killed by firing squad. In May this year she appeared on North Korean television speaking at an event in Pyongyang and looking very much alive."}

After all, you are the only one who lives your life, knows your experience, and is capable of truly changing yourself for the better. The end-of-the-year is the perfect time for strategic reflection. The calendar\u2019s conclusion is a natural time to look back.\n1. Do a Day-by-day Review of the Year. I pull out my calendar for the past year and write down every engagement I had, listing them all on a single sheet of paper. For each I include (a) the length or date of the engagement, (b) my client\u2019s name, and (c) what I earned. Then, I look at the whole sheet and ask myself what I want to do more of and what I want to do less of. I put little pluses (+) next to those that represent what I want to do more of. This is part one of my New Year Strategy.\n2. Identify A New Area You Want to Master. Two years ago it was writing for me. I found writing a challenge, difficult. My first 1400 word article ruined a perfectly good week-long vacation with my wife. I really struggled. But, I knew that writing was an important way to communicate and I determined that I would master it. Today I write 12 blog posts per week in less than 3 hours, keep a personal poetry journal, publish the FreelanceFortune newsletter twice per month, and I just finished the final edit of my first commercially published book, coming out this May. I wrote the book in 2 1/2 months of disciplined writing, about 90 minutes in the morning 5-6 days/week. It is not always easy. But, I have watched myself improve steadily. I am not yet where I want to be, but I have made real progress. What will you choose? Pick something that you want to master and make the commitment. This is part two of my New Year Strategy.\n3. Identify Your Business Growth Intentions for the First Half of the Next Year. I like to work with a six-month timeline because I find it manageable. In order to achieve my goals I have 2-3 months to ramp up and 3-4 months to get results. In the second half of 2009 I focused on reaching two groups: association CEOs and Independent Consultants. I now have significant and growing penetration with both. What are your growth intentions for the first half of 2010? This is part three of my New Year Strategy.\n4. Use Downtime over the Holidays to Reflect. I count on slow moments, naps, reading quietly, early morning walks, bird watching, and special times with family to bring me the distance and peaceful joy I need to take a wider view of life. I look forward to these personal experiences, knowing their power to be both immense and subtle.\nThis short doc is a great reference for gong forward. There is something powerful about the simple act of documenting your intentions. In fact, each of these five simple acts is profound in its impact and the synergy of the collection is extraordinary. Time to reflect and listen to your inner wisdom is irreplaceable \u2013 you must do it. To achieve an exceptional life, reflection is mandatory. The time when the end of one year meets the beginning of another is perfectly fitted for it.\nThis work is deep and elemental, with a quiet power. Draw on the natural rhythm of the calendar and use it to your benefit."}

Maggie is now making preparations to take action against Rick. Daryl, Rick's right-hand man, appears to be on her side. Though Rick may have his hands full with in-fighting between members of the group, a new threat will soon emerge in the form of the Whisperers.\nShowrunner Angela Kang told TVLine that during season 9 Michonne will rise to a \"position of power.\" Kang added that it will be \"fun seeing where Michonne goes this season.\" This suggests that Michonne, who has already been instrumental in many of their past battles, will receive more responsibilities in the upcoming season. As the leader of Alexandria, Rick could give Michonne an official position.\nIt shows how far Michonne has come since she joined the series in season 3. Michonne wasn't considered to be trustworthy when she first crossed paths with Rick's group, and was even labeled a \"loose cannon.\" Michonne's character has evolved a great deal over the course of the series. She also developed friendships with many of the core characters, particularly Rick and Carl. Michonne has also been a source of strength for Rick. When Rick is faced with a tough decision, he often receives advice from Michonne.\nIt's possible that Michonne's new position is a sign of things to come for The Walking Dead. This is Rick's last season on the show, so in his absence another character will have to rise up and take his place. Having new responsibilities in the community could give Michonne the experience she'll need to take charge after Rick is gone. With Maggie leaving as well, and Daryl at odds with their current direction, Michonne seems like a likely candidate for Alexandria's next leader. As she shares many of Rick's values and ideas about what Alexandria should be, she could pick up where Rick leaves off and help take Alexandria down a similar path.\nThe Walking Dead season 9 premieres October 7 on AMC."}

AsSeenonTV.com lists 650 products from multiple vendors.\nIn the online videos, spokesmen like the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and the entertainer 50 Cent will host product demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s much like what makes a home shopping network work \u2014 it\u2019s a visual, it\u2019s storytelling, it\u2019s presenting and bringing the products to life,\u201d Mr. Harrington said.\nThe videos will also be pushed out by e-mail to subscribers to the site. Mr. Harrington hopes to use former hosts from home shopping channels in addition to celebrity endorsers.\nSome of the newer products being pitched by celebrities include a nonabrasive household cleaner product line called PumMagic, which is made of finely ground pumice and includes a spray, scrubs and sponges. The product will be endorsed by Hulk Hogan, whose physical strength is meant to mirror the strength of the cleanser, Mr. Harrington said.\nA high-end set of wireless over-the ear headphones that is being promoted by 50 Cent, who is no stranger to product pitches after being a spokesman for Vitamin Water drinks, will sell for $300 to $400.\nStreamlining the way consumers buy these products is one a crucial goal.

Evita Peron's power was more significant to Argentineans after her death than during her life. Saints tend to be more useful in a state of persisting decomposition than one of living composure.\nNow, it is the Bin Laden phenomenon which appears, yet again, with all its mind numbing force. Facebook and Twitter are overheating with the announcements that America's bug bear has been butchered in his cave, or should we say compound. The body is being held in US custody, and we await the various statements from the Obama administration with a sense of boorish inevitability.\nThe death of Bin Laden, who was supposedly assassinated by US forces while in Pakistan, is irrelevant. It never mattered than he was alive to begin with, given the very operation his organisation was supposedly running. The same mistake was made by the Red Brigades operating in Italy during the 1970s \u2013 one cannot attack the capitalist system by merely murdering capitalists. The nodal points of business still function with a degree of effortlessness, resisting the slight bumps of assassination. Ideas do tend to outlive their holders. As Roland Jacquard claimed in 2002, Al Qaeda 'no longer needs either [Bin Laden's] physical existence or his funds; alive or dead, he has become a talisman for a diffuse, self-sufficient terrorist network with every intention of fulfilling its mission to \"lead the world into the apocalypse\".' One might as well start bumping off the managers of Coca Cola.\nThe stories of the intrepid Saudi royal cross-dressing as he was moving (lumbering?) across the Afghan-Pakistan border, sneaking out of his cave complex in Tora Bora were the sort of stuff that should have made David Letterman swoon. In fact, he may well have thought about it. Then came suggestions that he was keeping company with a dialysis machine, tempered by the occasional pack of salt. Bin Laden had become, in short, something of a hyper-real figure, someone who defied the laws of physics in being both dead and alive. He was everywhere and nowhere at the same time, haunting the West with video footage, pronouncements and promises of permanent retribution in the name of an imminent Caliphate.\nNow, for a little bit of necrophilia, or at the very least, over familiarity with the dead. This chat about historical bodies being appropriated, used and re-used is not new. The historical record is rich with them. Here, we have an eerie similarity \u2013 the body of Adolf Hitler, which did its rounds with the Soviets when its burntout remains were discovered, persists in remaining interesting for a few overly keen observers. Did he go to South America for a long spell of warm weather and a dash of tango? Did he, in fact, perish in the bunker with dog and wife? It certainly proved interesting to those who discovered the body, leaving the Red Army intelligence unit SMERSH with a fine set of dental records.\nIndeed, for the mystics and conspirators out there, there is another note: Hitler gave orders on April 30, 1945 to his personal adjunct, Otto Gunsche, that both the body of himself and his wife Eva Braun would be burned on their deaths. Bin Laden's killing only just took place. The stars have aligned"}

There were decreases in such cases during the summer.\n\"When we looked at the number of kids awaiting placement or admitted at one time, month by month, there is a huge difference in the months,\" Plemmons said. \"Certainly, the month of the year that is the lowest for suicidal thoughts and ideation is July. And we see those numbers creep back up right when school starts.\"\nA number of factors could explain the increase in suicidal tendencies as of late, but concrete reasoning for more suicidal children is still unclear, Plemmons said in a news release.\n\"Research to understand factors contributing to these alarming trends is urgently needed,\" he said.\nThe study did not include actual suicides among children.

The letter reveals for the first time that McVey was holding the recording device, suggested the video be sent to a national television show, and continued showing it to colleagues after several told her it was inappropriate.\nBogner wrote that once the boy became stuck, McVey \"castigated\" him and \"refused to allow another adult to help him.\"\nThe video shows the child with his chest resting on the seat and his head and arms protruding through an opening in the back. According to the letter, McVey took photos with her camera and borrowed a staffer&apos;s smartphone to record video, announcing \"it would be funny\" to have the footage for \"America&apos;s Funniest Home Videos.\"\nMaintenance workers eventually freed the boy, who was stuck for about 10 minutes. When the class reconvened, McVey played the video on a large-screen television for all the students -- including the boy, Bogner said.\n\"It was particularly callous for Ms. McVey to force (the student) to be present while others laughed at his predicament,\" Bogner wrote, adding that McVey later showed the video to fellow teachers and staff members.\nMessages seeking comment were left Friday with McVey&apos;s lawyer, William Young, who wrote in a filing that his client \"did not take the video of the student for malicious purposes.\"\nIn the letter, sent to the school board in January, Bogner recommended that McVey be fired.\n\"Teachers are not to humiliate and ridicule students, particularly special-needs students,\" he wrote.\nSix days later, the school board voted 5-1 to remove McVey through the state&apos;s teacher tenure process, but the teacher appealed. Some students, parents and fellow teachers spoke at the Jan. 13 school board meeting in support of McVey and criticized board members for voting to dismiss her.\nBut the boy&apos;s parents, upset that McVey was lauded by people who hadn&apos;t seen the video, authorized their lawyer to release the video to a local TV station -- and the airing in February generated uproar in the community, about an hour&apos;s drive northwest of Detroit.

The team also met with a group of minority leaders from Europe who had been German Marshall Fund fellows.\nBut while team members admired aspects of the European systems, they raised several caveats. Immigrants and members of minority groups, for example, did not fare well in the apprenticeship programs the delegates visited, and women rarely entered apprenticeships in traditionally male occupations.\nThe council suggests creating safeguards in this country to insure that Latinos and other minority students are not tracked into apprenticeships when they should be preparing for college; given less than an equal opportunity to participate; or denied access to apprenticeships because there are no alternative entry points for school dropouts and those with special needs.\nIt also notes that European countries provide a living wage for their apprentices, so that even youths from poor families can participate in long-term training.\n\"The only way to assure an appropriate school-to-work transition system in the United States,'' concluded Raul Yzaguirre, the council's president, \"is by including and involving minority leaders and practitioners--and minority community-based organizations--as full partners in the planning and pilot-testing of new approaches.'' To date, the report notes, such involvement has been minimal.\nCopies of the report, \"The Forgotten Two-Thirds: An Hispanic Perspective on Apprenticeship, European Style,'' are available from the Publications Department, N.C.L.R., 810 First St., N.E., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20005-4205; (202) 289-1380.\nAt least one group thinks the federal government should spend more money on vocational education for nondisadvantaged students who are not college-bound.\nIn a paper released this summer, the National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing suggests increasing federal expenditures for technical education from $1.2 billion to $6 billion by fiscal 1997.\nBut the high-tech group advocates that the money be more evenly distributed among the general population, rather than focused primarily on poor and special-needs students.\nThe U.S. Labor Department has awarded $13.3 million to Mathematica Policy Research Inc. of Princeton, N.J., for the first comprehensive evaluation of the Job Corps in more than a decade.\nPresident Clinton has slated the Great Society program for a major expansion based, in part, on a 1982 study that found the program returned $1.46 to society for every dollar spent.\nThe new study will assess the employment and earnings of Job Corps graduates, as well as the program's cost benefits.\nThe department has also awarded an $800,000 contract to the Educational Testing Service to develop a workplace-literacy test for job-training sites, local employment services, and other organizations engaged in literacy training.\nThe test is a byproduct of an earlier E.T.S. study, \"Beyond the School Doors,'' that assessed the literacy skills of nearly 6,000 adults.\nThe dearth of"}

His repeated demonstrations of arrogance, contempt for the American people, and smug self-satisfaction brought mortification to his party and president. His glib references to the redistributionist aspects of the Affordable Care Act gave the lie to the Democratic party\u2019s dubious claim that the mandate was not a tax, along with the excruciating (to Democrats) acknowledgment that, presidential oaths to the contrary notwithstanding, Democrats regard \u201cnontransparency\u201d as their friend.\nSo, all hail the verbally incontinent Mr. Gruber for revealing the truth underlying Obamacare: It would not have passed if it had been presented honestly. Gruber, Obama, Pelosi, Reid, and Co. didn\u2019t ever succeed in hoodwinking the majority of Americans. Obamacare was unpopular when proposed, despised when passed, and remains disliked to this day. Gruber\u2019s contribution was to put a frame around its essential deception.\nEnough to secure the \u201cworst year\u201d award? Yes, but as it happens, there was something else that emerged about him that dredges up some unfinished business from a decade ago.\nRecall that the 2005 bestseller Freakonomics made a huge splash with the claim that Roe v. Wade was responsible for the drop in crime America experienced starting in the 1990s. The theory, simplified for space, was that fewer unwanted babies began to be born after 1973. These aborted babies did not turn 18 in 1991, and accordingly did not commit crimes, leading to the dramatic drop in crime experienced in the 1990s.\nConsidering that 30 percent of abortions are obtained by African-American women, though they comprise just 13 percent of the population, Gruber was in effect arguing that reducing the number of poor black children was, not to put too fine a point on it, a \u201cpositive good.\u201d One cannot begin to imagine the outcry if a conservative academic (that rare specimen) had published similar conclusions with such sangfroid.\nLeave aside the moral obtuseness of arguing that abortion is justified because it reduces crime or welfare expenditures (which party is supposed to be stingy with welfare, again?) and consider the many, many possible explanations for the drop in crime that began in the 1990s. There was the waning of the crack epidemic. There was New York\u2019s introduction of \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing in 1994. New York\u2019s crime rate declined by 70 percent between 1990 and 2000, and then dropped another 30 percent by 2005, a decline that was twice the national average and that was itself responsible for a significant percentage of the overall crime-drop numbers in the U.S. Or consider that the incarceration rate \u2014 local, state, and federal \u2014 quadrupled from 1980 to 2001.\nBut let\u2019s imagine that Gruber was right \u2014 that legalizing abortion eliminated a big cohort of the criminal element and led to a drop in crime. Did every one of those aborted criminals merit the death penalty? The car thieves? The embezzlers? Did each one deserve a preemptive death penalty? Before trial?"}

SIS shares have appreciated 62 per cent since listing in August 2017.\nAt a recent analyst meeting, the company management projected 25 per cent revenue growth for the next three years. The domestic security business, the Australian business and its facility management service contribute 37 per cent, 47 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, while other business accounts for the remainder.\nSIS\u2019s domestic security revenue grew 34 per cent in the past three years, while the industry grew by 11 per cent. This resulted in a gain in market share, which was 10 per cent at the end of FY18.\nGrowth came after the company started tapping big clients looking at security services in the hinterland, which resulted in new business from the expanding manufacturing segment, while most top security companies kept their focus on banking, financial services and insurance companies and IT customers.\nThe revenue gap between the largest company Group4S and the domestic security business of SIS narrowed to Rs 500 crore at the end of FY18 from more than Rs 1,500 crore about five years ago. The higher market share could translate into better pricing power for SIS. The company continues to grow 2 per cent on a monthly basis. The street is pricing in 23-24 per cent revenue growth of domestic security business for FY19 and FY20.\nThe facility management business revenue grew 69 per cent in FY18, aided by the contribution of Dusters, a company acquired in August 2017, and robust organic growth. Margins in the unit widened to 5.1 per cent in FY18 from 3.4 per cent in FY17 due to the benefit of scale and cross-selling opportunities with SIS\u2019s security services client.\nThe Australian security business has been a cash cow, and the company\u2019s position in Australia will strengthen after the acquisition of SXP, a mobile patrol company. The synergies from the acquisition may boost margins of the Australian business by 80-90 basis points."}
{"idx": "9167", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Ohio Civil Rights Commission dismisses landlords' complaint about cleanup legislation.\nCHILLICOTHE \u2013 A complaint filed by two area landlords arguing the City of Chillicothe's meth lab cleanup ordinance is discriminatory was shot down by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.\nIn a letter of determination sent in late October to landlords Mike McCoy and Joe Sharp and to city Law Director Sherri Rutherford, the commission ruled after an investigation that the complaint filed by McCoy and Sharp failed to meet three criteria to show the ordinance was discriminatory.\nAt issue was the law passed in March mandating that property owners are liable for paying for the cost of hazardous material cleanup and recovery efforts resulting from meth labs discovered on their properties once identified by law enforcement. McCoy and Sharp were vocal opponents of the legislation as it worked through the council process, saying it unfairly targeted minorities and low-income residents by causing landlords to raise rents to cover potential costs and possibly making it more difficult for some minorities to pass a more rigorous landlord screening process.\nThe Civil Rights Commission, in the findings of fact from its investigation, found that the landlords' claims were not supported by the evidence, nor had the elements to make a case of an adverse impact on minorities or low-income residents for three reasons.\nFirst, the commission found the city had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for enacting the legislation, having dealt with paying for hazardous material cleanup of area meth labs in the past.\n\"The ordinance permits the (city) to seek recovery of these costs, first from the tenant, and then from the owner of the property if the tenant is unable to pay,\" the decision reads. \"The plain language of the ordinance does not require or identifies any particular action that any landlord must take to avoid being in a position of being liable for these potential costs.\"\nIn other words, the ordinance does not tell landlords how to screen potential tenants, it just informs them of the potential consequences if a meth lab is discovered on their property.\nSecond, the commission determined that since there have been no meth labs located within the city known to police since the ordinance went into effect. As a result, there's no way to show that there has been any discriminatory harm to minorities or low-income residents by the law's enactment.\nFinally, the commission ruled that it is possible for landlords to conduct screening of potential tenants without having a discriminatory effect.\n\"Evidence shows that it is possible when conducting criminal background checks to identify persons who have been previously convicted on counts of methamphetamine manufacturing, as opposed to simple drug use or distribution,\" the commission stated. \"Evidence shows that the overwhelming majority of persons convicted of methamphetamine-related charges are Caucasian (96 percent), whereas persons convicted of all drug use or distribution are disproportionately African-American or other minority.\"\nThe commission went on to say that its investigation revealed that \"one of the charging parties does not uniformly apply any background checks at all, much less screen out persons with previous convictions,\" and that the percentage of minorities renting from McCoy and Sharp mirrors the approximate percentage of the minority population of the county.\nWhen the factors were taken as a whole, the commission concluded the city's ordinance is not an unlawful discriminatory act and does not require any other person to engage in discriminatory behavior against any class of people.\n\"Therefore, the Commission finds no credible information supporting Charging Party's allegation of unlawful activity,\" the commission concluded"}

It wasn\u2019t just that the director, Ryan Coogler, and the majority of the cast were black \u2013 something rare enough on screen as it is, let alone in a superhero film.\nNor was it simply that the story focused on black characters in powerful roles, telling a story with them at the centre.\nClanton was keen to get as many kids of Indigenous Australian and African heritage along to see the film in her current hometown of Melbourne as she could. Inspired by the charitable actions of Hollywood stars such as Octavia Spencer, but without any financial capacity of her own to fund a screening \u2013 or, indeed, any experience in events management or fundraising \u2013 Clanton decided to start a GoFundMe page to generate some community support for the event.\n\u201cI had no idea what I was doing,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia, laughing. She was nevertheless propelled by the firm belief that it is important for young black kids to see themselves represented in the stories they see on screen.\nBecause there were so few Indigenous faces on TV, much of her inspiration came from the black American faces in films and sitcoms such as The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\n\u201cI think we don\u2019t see ourselves often represented in powerful positions, especially as people of colour, often we\u2019re relegated to the sidelines as supporting or expositional narratives,\u201d Clanton says.\nClanton said she cried when a publicist from the film\u2019s production company Marvel called her to say they would provide funds to support the first screening so that it was cost-neutral. With that initial support, she would potentially be able to host multiple screenings, and she plans to use the funds raised online to do just that.\nMarvel would not comment on the nature of the support they were providing, only to confirm that they had come across Clanton\u2019s GoFundMe page and were able to facilitate a screening for her.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an endless discussion of inclusivity and diversification, and I think on a societal level we throw the word diversity around ... without actively laying down the foundation, challenging structures,\u201d Clanton says.\nFor Clanton, the recent media beat-up over youth crime in Melbourne only added fuel to that fire.\nIn order to fill the screenings, she has reached out to Melbourne-based community groups and youth-focused organisations and is still taking expressions of interest through the fundraising page."}

Charlie Rangel and waiting for the \"political chips\" to \"fall where they may.\" Imagine a custodial service that fixed toilet clogs by letting the overflowing waste and polluted waters \"fall where they may.\"\nAt a press conference to preempt the bipartisan House ethics panel's announcement of 13 ethics and federal regulation charges against Rangel on Thursday afternoon, Pelosi claimed to take \"great pride\" in her swamp-draining record. Unblinkingly, she cited the House trial against Rangel as proof that the \"process\" is working. But that beleaguered panel has been pathetically understaffed, has dragged its feet for two years on the Rangel case and has administered more halfhearted wrist-slaps than all the pushover parents on a season of \"Nanny 911.\"\nClinging bitterly to the moral equivalence card, Pelosi carped about Bush-era GOP corruption.

The system does not contain any voter names or other information, helping to ensure a private ballot for each voter.\nClearVote includes accessible voting devices that will be deployed in the Auditor\u2019s Office and another remote site each election. The accessible voting devices allow users to mark their ballot independently using their own preferred assistive tools, such as a sip/puff or toggle pad accessory. The device user screens are based on the Anywhere Ballot developed by the Center for Civic Design. After a user marks a ballot on screen, the system produces a paper ballot with their choices.

In a context marked by the problems faced by the international community to contain North Korean proliferation and by an increase in hostile declarations and the deployment of forces, this analysis sets out the need to adopt dissuasive and tension-reducing measures that could, first, avoid aggravating the current situation and, secondly, make progress towards freezing proliferation at its current levels and constructing a negotiating framework that would make it sustainable.\nThe current situation has been brewing thanks to commission on the part of the North Korean authorities and omission on the part of the regional powers, which have left unchecked what is now an imminent risk factor for regional security: that of a military confrontation in which conventional and nuclear arms may be used.\nIt is thought that Pyongyang started to develop a clandestine nuclear arms programme at the start of the 1980s, which it later accelerated at three moments of particular insecurity for the North Korean regime: the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, its inclusion in the so-called \u2018axis of evil\u2019 by George W. Bush in 2002 and Kim Jong-un\u2019s ascent to power following the death of his father. In the first two cases, international diplomatic efforts were made in both the 1994 Agreed Framework and the Six-party Talks (2003-09) that failed in their attempt to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme in exchange for economic aid and security guarantees. Since 2011 the North Korean regime has sped up its programmes aimed at crossing the nuclear threshold (see Table 1) and reformed its constitution to institutionalise its nuclear programme and strengthen the legitimacy of Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership. The initial goal of de-nuclearising the Korean Peninsula is therefore no longer viable and those who were seeking to avoid it will now have to choose between military steps that disrupt or terminate the programmes already underway (counter-proliferation) or diplomatic steps that seek some form of accommodation with the new nuclear power (non-proliferation).\nResponsibility for arriving at this pass is shared across a range of actors. The chief culprits are the political and military leaders of North Korea, who continue believing and warning the population that there is going to be an external military intervention aimed at wiping out their regime, and have accordingly pushed forward with nuclear programmes on the grounds that their survival depends on them. Hence Pyongyang has stopped complying with the promises made to prevent proliferation and used such agreements to buy time and resources, all the while developing its nuclear programme, putting paid to the various talks processes that were underway.\nFor its part, the US has been vacillating on its policy towards North Korea, which at times has led it to renege on its commitments and accentuate mistrust in Pyongyang.

So this new interview is a wonderful thing indeed.\nAs someone that loves all things Game Boy related, it\u2019s interesting to hear more on how the system came about, as Okada explains, \u201cWhen I was young, I was rather stubborn and often became angry at my superiors when was trying to defend my ideas. The best example of this was the Game Boy. The Game Boy you know today actually had nothing to do with the one Gunpei Yokoi had in mind. He saw the Game Boy as a direct follow-on from the Game & Watch, which meant a rather cheap toy, without any real business model and no long-term ambition.\n\u201cTo give you a clear comparison, Yokoi wanted a Game Boy that would have looked like the Microvision and would not have lasted more than one or two seasons. For instance, he did not care if there were third-party editors or not. Furthermore, he only wanted \u2018quick games\u2019, quickly completed and quickly forgotten. I wanted the Game Boy to have more ambition, closer to what the R&D2 had managed to with the Famicom: a machine built to last, with hardware that was good enough to play a variety of quality titles.\nFrom this it\u2019s clear that the development of the Game Boy wasn\u2019t a straightforward affair at all and that it could have ended up very different, as well as something rather short lived and awful.\nHowever, the creation of the Nintendo DS almost happened in reverse compared to the Game Boy, as the dual screen functionality was something that confounded people at Nintendo when it was suggested.\n\u201cAfter the Game Boy Advance SP, we were working on the newest model in this range. The code name for this new Game Boy was IRIS, like the flower. The explanation for this name is simple: since it was for us the fifth generation of Game Boy, we chose the symbol of May (the fifth month of the year). In the Hanafuda playing cards, the month of May is symbolized by the Iris.\n\u201cThe project was moving forward at a good pace but during the development, something unexpected happened. President Satoru Iwata came to see me. He was obviously bothered and he said: \u2018l talked to Yamauchi-san over the phone and he thinks your console should have two screens, a bit like the multi-screen Game & Watch, you see?\u2019 Everybody is aware of this, but what people do not know is that at the time, everybody hated this idea, even Iwata himself.\nConsidering that the Nintendo DS is the company\u2019s strongest selling console to date, with over 150 million units sold worldwide, it\u2019s interesting to know that its signature dual screen setup was something that was initially disliked.\nIn addition to this recent interview, Shmuplations also translated an interview from a few years back with Okada. It\u2019s also worth a read, not least for his take on the future of consoles, which I think is entirely spot on."}

In fact, at least one child dies every 10 minutes due to preventable diseases such as diarrhea, malnutrition, and respiratory tract infections, according to the agency.\n\"We have seen many tragedies like Jamila's every day. We know currently almost 7 million Yemenis are facing severe food insecurity, which means they don't know where their next meal will come from,\" Sherin Varkey, UNICEF's deputy representative to Yemen, told RT.\nHe went on to state that families are making \"life and death choices\" such as deciding whether to invest in treating a sick child or feeding their healthy children.\n\"The situation is getting worse and time is running out for the children in Yemen,\" Varkey said.\nIn addition to hunger, malnutrition and disease, innocent Yemenis are falling victim to the ongoing violence in the country, with the Saudi-led coalition being blamed for civilian deaths due to airstrikes. However, the coalition has refuted claims that it has targeted innocent people.\nMore than 10,000 people are estimated to have been killed since the start of Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen, according to the UN."}

Photo by Walter Herfst, courtesy of FABRIC.\nThe concept of Trylletromler comes from the Danish word for the 19th-century zoetrope device, which gives the illusion of movement in a still image. Based on this idea, the pavilion's fence is built as a paradoxically transparent maze that creates the illusion of motion as one walks through it.\n\"...The Renaissance garden design of Rosenborg Castle is the oldest known example of garden design in Denmark. The design draws heavily on principles of Euclidean geometry. This language of absolute space was long regarded as the construction principle of the world. The architecture, urbanism and landscape design that were derived from it, were essentially aiming to create order out of chaos using absolute shapes: line, square, triangle, sphere and cone. In a later stage baroque elements were added, such as mazes and diagonal paths. Also Kavalergangen and Damegangen, two tree-lined avenues, were introduced. After these alterations the garden was never drastically changed. This classical representation of space was meticulously maintained until today.\nThis is the context for the question to design a pavilion, which is accessible to all public, appears innovative in its spatial expression and is challenging by its idiom. While remaining removable the design had to be realized within a very limited budget. FABRIC therefore introduced a new spatial concept in the royal garden in Copenhagen by stretching the understanding of the \u2018pavilion\u2019 towards the most elementary architectural element in garden design: the fence.\nThis new understanding of space provided by questioning strict order in the garden design and give way to ambivalence and hybridity is a ' blurring strategy' . This strategy addresses three independent paradoxes by provoking the notions inside and outside, by introducing a maze that is paradoxically transparent and by creating an illusion of motion.\nFirst of all, the fence as a freestanding structure is designed to restrict movement across a boundary. By folding and wrinkling the fence on the location, it produces new meanings of being spatially included or excluded.\nThirdly, the fence gives new meaning by its potential to create the illusion of motion via the so called moir\u00e9 patterns while moving along the fence. The fence is made out of three thousand standard pieces of Nordic timber, which are joined using an irregular pattern of wedges. The repetitive openings between the bars of the fence and their connections create a continuous moving image. When one thinks of a fence made out of sticks with narrow vertical slits arranged on a circular layout the image of a Zoetrope - or \u2018wheel of life\u2019 - jumps to mind. This 19th century device triggers an impression of movement within a still image.\nBased on these three principles an intriguing floor plan was designed using a composition of ten perfect circles. The plan design reacts to given circumstances such as the exit of the rose garden, the statue by the water, sightlines towards the castle, existing tree lines and the position of solitary trees.\nThe maze like structure has in fact only one detail for all its connections. The entire structure built with 2967 standard pieces spruce of 38 millimeters thick and 68 millimeters wide. The narrow side of the uprights is placed forwards, while the cross-links are made of the same wood rotated ninety degrees. Each cross-link has a height of 200 millimeters and is planed under an angle on"}

As new export projects came on stream in Gladstone, Queensland, there was a risk that gas could be diverted from domestic to export markets, leaving NSW with a growing gas shortfall.\n\"It [gas] could become very expensive. There are people speculating it could cost $10 a gigajoule or more.\"\nWhile prices could start to rise next year, Mr Macfarlane said they could move \"in a big way\" in 2016.

He said that the absence of Turner also posed a particular risk for Dish\u2019s Sling TV, which offers a slimmed-down menu of channels delivered over the internet.\nThe Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger in November, arguing that the increased bargaining power of AT&T-Time Warner would lead to higher prices for consumers.

On Monday, Judge Leon said that Schlichting\u2019s access to the transcript was a violation of rules prohibiting witnesses from reading about proceedings prior to taking the stand.

Randolph Keim, 1890 | Jacob Keim, a Chester County native and Atlantic City hotelier, helped gather public support for Alexander Boardman's concept of a boardwalk.\nWhen it comes to the so-called Lizzie Lincoln House, the truth might just be stranger than the fiction.\n\u201cI call it the Boardman House,\u201d said Charles J. Adams III of Exeter Township, a retired radio personality and author of several books on ghost stories.\nAdams wrote about the once-grand house on Lincoln Road in Exeter and wants to set the record straight. There never was a Lizzie Lincoln, he said. That story was invented in the 1980s by promoters of a former Halloween attraction at the site.\nFor more than a hundred years, the federal-style house built between 1825 and 1850 for Isaac and Mary (Myerly) Huyett was owned by three generations of the Seitzinger-Boardman family, including the wife and son of Alexander Boardman, inventor of Atlantic City\u2019s boardwalk.\nThe story of Boardman and his boardwalk has been told many times in various publications over the years, Hoffman said.\nBoardman came up with the idea of using a boardwalk to help keep sand out of the railroad cars and hotels and pitched it to his friend, hotelier Jacob Keim, said local historian Sharon Merolli, formerly of Exeter Township and now of Upper Providence, Montgomery County. The two men initiated a petition prompting the installation in 1870 of an eight-foot-wide temporary wooden walkway at a cost of $5,000, half of Atlantic City\u2019s tax revenue for that year, according to worldhistoryproject.org.\nBoardman and Keim had local connections, Merolli said.\nKeim, the owner of Chester County House, a popular Atlantic City guest house and one of the first to stay open year-round, was a Chester County native and descendant of the Oley Valley pioneer Jacob Keim.\nMerolli said Alexander Boardman\u2019s wife, Mary Agnes, nee Souder, inherited the house now known as the Lizzie Lincoln House in 1864 from her uncle, Franklin Seitzinger. At that time, she was married to Alexander Newbold.\nHoffman, 90, said he was acquainted with later generations of the Boardman family, who spent the colder months at the Exeter farmhouse.

Because the reference period in 2004 changed from school year to fiscal year, as did the categories themselves, comparisons with previous years cannot be made.\n\"Overview of Public Elementary and Secondary Students, Staff, Schools, School Districts, Revenues, and Expenditures: School Year 2004-05 and Fiscal Year 2004\" is posted by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nTotal current expenditures increased by 11 percent during the previous four-year period, from $348 billion (adjusted for inflation) in the 1999-2000 school year to $388 billion in the 2002-03 school year. The percentage of current expenditures allocated specifically to instruction remained relatively constant during this time period, hovering between 61 and 62 percent, and the costs themselves also increased by 11 percent, from $215 billion (adjusted for inflation) in the 1999-2000 school year, to $238 billion in the 2002-03 school year.\nIn fiscal year 2004, the percentage of current expenditures allocated to instruction and instruction-related activities ranged from a low of 60.5 percent in Oklahoma to a high of 71.2 percent in New York, with the U.S. average being 66.1 percent. Most of the states in the northeastern region tended to spend a higher percentage of current expenditures on instruction and instruction-related activities as compared to the U.S. average, with many of the Southern states falling below the mean.\n* NCES defines current expenditures in education as follows: Current expenditures represent the day-to-day operation of schools and include all costs except those associated with repaying debts, capital outlays (e.g., purchases of land, school construction and repair, and equipment), and programs outside the scope of prekindergarten to 12th grade, such as adult education, community colleges, and community services.

Even after the pair had to be separated, he continued to motion to Embiid that he was ready to fight.\nIt\u2019s hard not to wonder if Smart could have made a difference down the stretch, given the tight final score and his ability to make \u201cwinning plays.\u201d At the time of Smart\u2019s ejection, the Sixers trailed by 11 points. They proceeded to chip away at Boston\u2019s lead, tying things up at 82 apiece with five minutes remaining in the third. By the end of the quarter, the Celtics clung onto a five-point advantage.\nSmart left the locker room without speaking to reporters. While Irving was not interested in making excuses for the loss, he noted that Smart \u201ctook responsibility\u201d for his actions and that the team has \u201csquashed\u201d it and moved on.\n\u201cThose things can\u2019t happen in terms of Smartie getting ejected, especially when we\u2019re in an environment like this,\u201d Irving said.\nEarlier this season, Smart was fined $35,000 for aggressively charging at Atlanta Hawks shooting guard DeAndre Bembry.\nJoel Embiid finally went off against the Celtics.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing that these guys can guard me better than anybody else, so I just had to come out and show that I\u2019m the most unstoppable player in the league,\u201d Embiid told ESPN in his walk-off interview Wednesday.\nIn undoubtedly his best game against the Celtics, Embiid unleashed a monster 37-point, 22-rebound performance. The 25-year-old was determined to feast from the start, seemingly motivated by his past struggles against Boston\u2019s defensive anchor Al Horford. According to the league\u2019s tracking data, Horford still presented problems for Embiid \u2014 limiting him to five points on 20 percent shooting (1-for-5) \u2014 but other Celtics didn\u2019t have the same impact.\nAgainst center Aron Baynes, for example, Embiid racked up 15 points on 3-for-4 shooting and eight free throws. Baynes logged just 12 minutes of play before exiting during the second quarter with an ankle injury.\nThe biggest differences between Embiid\u2019s stat line Wednesday and those from previous games against the Celtics are his number of free-throw attempts (22) and his number of three-point attempts (3). In the last meeting between the two teams, for example, he only got to the line four times and attempted eight th"}

Geragos said the defense is willing to entertain an offer to buy the truck.\nGirolami earlier agreed with the defense that the prosecution had had sufficient time to examine the truck and said prosecutors could use an identical truck for any demonstration to jurors.\nIn last week's court filing opposing the motion by Geragos to return the truck, prosecutors disclosed that they believe it was used to transport Laci Peterson's body to a warehouse rented by Scott Peterson and then on to San Francisco Bay. His blood was found in the cab, which investigators believe could have been the result of a struggle.\nDeputy District Attorney Rick Distaso said he needed to keep the truck to show jurors how he believes it was used to transport Laci Peterson's body. He argued that photographs would not suffice.\nLast week, Geragos said that if the prosecution believed it needed to keep the truck as evidence, \"I'm perfectly willing to sell them the truck.\"\nA \"cementlike\" material found in the truck bed has been sent to the Justice Department for testing, and Distaso said prosecutors needed to retain the truck in case additional samples were needed.\nGeragos also said he would file his request seeking a change of venue on Monday, rather than Friday, as had been expected. He has argued that massive publicity in Stanislaus County has precluded the possibility that his client can get a fair trial in Modesto.\nAlso Friday, Girolami gave his consent to a telephone survey of people who have already served on a jury in the county this year and who would be ineligible to be on one in the Peterson case.\nThe prosecution wants to survey people in Sacramento and Los Angeles counties, too, and compare the results with those from Stanislaus County.\nPeterson's trial is set to begin January 26. However, hearings in early January on the change of venue motions and motions to dismiss the charges could alter the timetable.\nPeterson, 31, is charged with murder in the deaths of his wife and their unborn son. Laci Peterson, 27, who was eight months' pregnant, disappeared from Modesto last Christmas Eve.\nWith the first anniversary of their deaths approaching, Dr. Benjamin Spindler, medical director of the Delta Blood Bank, said his group had been contacted by a friend of Laci Peterson's family to hold a memorial blood drive from December 21 until December"}

Our family room is a football field and soccer stadium. The couch acts as \"other players\" and, in his mind, I'm always ready for a pass - whether I'm looking or not. Ouch.\nWill even recently brought home an \"All About Drew Brees\" library book to study up on his moves. There's no argument -- this boy loves sports.\nWill is about to enter his third season playing flag football. To say he loves it would be the ultimate understatement. I'm lucky enough to help coach and watch him develop as an athlete from the sidelines. See it for yourself - the kid has some moves.\nThe option to play really isn't an option \u2013 at least to my son. He's all in and wants to continue. It's a fantastic team building sport and the scheduling is great. The commitment is two hours per week -total!\nAny busy parent will appreciate that. I'm thrilled to see \"bigger\" kids playing flag football. They have teen tournaments and even adult leagues.\nSo, the option to continue as a flag player is there. But, Will is fascinated by the NFL. I am mentally preparing myself for the moment when he asks me to play tackle football.\nI've seen the research. We've done countless stories on Local 4 on the lasting impacts hard hits can have on your body. Concussions are a major concern for me...not to mention all of the other injuries that come with tackle football.\nSo, why the debate? I worry I\u2019m standing in the way of my son doing something he loves. Something he could be good at.

It\u2019s based on their studies of head impacts. According to the new research, seven models earned the highest rating of five stars.

The biliary ducts carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Patients with severe duct blockages or difficult anatomies \u2013 such as gastric bypass or liver transplant patients -- face serious complications including infection, sepsis, biliary cirrhosis or injury to the liver.\nToday, most of these patients will either need to undergo two separate one-hour interventional procedures for stent placement or if considered poor candidates for the staged stent procedure, undergo a drain placement instead. If the biliary blockage is managed with a drain, the drain must be exchanged for a new one every 2-3 months, for life.\nThe ConvertX System is the first system to provide interventional radiologists with a percutaneous plastic biliary stent option. The system is designed to eliminate the need for the second invasive procedure and the associated risk, cost, and time. Rather than a drain-to-stent exchange, the ConvertX System itself enables stent release in less than one minute during an in-office visit or at bedside without the need for sedation or repeated drain insertions.\nBiliary obstructions may be caused by tumors, gallstones, enlarged lymph nodes, cysts or strictures. IRs treat biliary obstructions that are more severe or anatomically challenging, such as in patients with gastric bypass or liver transplants, through two separate one-hour interventional procedures for stent placement.\nThe ConvertX Biliary Stent System is part of BrightWater Medical\u2019s ConvertX Stent Family, which includes the company\u2019s innovative ConvertX Nephroureteral Stent System cleared by the FDA for treatment of ureteral obstructions. That system enables the IR to eliminate a second invasive interventional procedure in treating patients with severe ureteral blockages.\nThe ConvertX Stent Family was featured at the Advanced Interventional Management (AIM) Symposium in New York City in November 2018 as the lead presentation during the \u201cNew and Innovative Technologies\u201d section. BrightWater received its medical device manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health and manufactures the ConvertX Stent Family at its facility in Temecula, CA.\nBrightWater Medical is a mid-stage medical device company uniquely positioned to significantly impact treatments provided by interventional radiologists. The company was founded by Dr. Bob Smouse, Professor of Radiology & Surgery, University of Illinois College of Medicine. Dr. Smouse is a leading interventional radiologist, clinician, academic and entrepreneur, with more than 20 years of experience in interventional radiology, endovascular surgery and clinical research.

Much more traditional than Peter Sellars's controversial, slowed-down, updated staging at Goodman Theatre three seasons ago, director Barbara Gaines's production of Shakespeare's 400-year-old drama is also far less probing into the play's continually perplexing religious and cultural conflicts. Setting the story in a Great Gatsby-esque milieu, evoked by Nan Cibula-Jenkins's gorgeous 20s fashions, Gaines offers a briskly paced but rather shallow rendition. Its strongest asset by far is Richard Russell Ramos's mercurial performance as the Jewish moneylender whose hateful bargain with the Christian debtor Antonio brings about his downfall: this wry, crafty Shylock's descent into self-destructive obsession as he pursues his claim to a pound of Antonio's flesh makes the stage crackle in a way the rest of the show does not.\nPart of the problem is Gaines's lack of sympathy for the Christian characters. By emphasizing their condescension toward and contempt for the Jewish figures, she makes us less interested than we should be in their romantic ups and downs: the bulk of the story, they also anchor the text's recurrent images of spiritual versus material connection. And the tone of the evening is erratic, veering from Ramos's complex, quirky line readings to such heavy-handed dramatic touches as a final tableau of the dispossessed Shylock at prayer to broadly caricatured comedy.

Both Darwitz and Wendell are now married and mothers and neither has played competitively in about a decade. So Darwitz put her coaching skills to work.\nNot that they were going to need them.

{"idx": "9243", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: President Trump departed from his own budget plan last week \u2014 in a good way. During a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., he declared support for \u201cfull funding of $300 million\u201d for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The White House budget proposal, released three weeks earlier, calls for $30 million directed to the program. Actually, that lesser sum fit a pattern, the president in his two previous budget plans proposing first no funding and then the same $30 million.\nFortunately, in each year, Congress has come to the rescue, Republicans and Democrats carrying the cause, appropriating roughly $300 million, as lawmakers have since the initiative got its start nine years ago. Now the president has made the task easier, that is, unless he changes his mind, something he tends to do.\nAgain, that sum has been typical, and a step down from $475 million approved in the first year. So, no one has been waiting for three decades or more. Neither has the president been the supporter he claims, as his budget plans testify. The Great Lakes rates as the world\u2019s largest system of fresh water. It does not feature \u201crecord deepness.\u201d As the fact checkers quickly pointed out, Crater Lake in Oregon is the country\u2019s deepest, and Lake Baikal in Russia is the deepest on the planet.\nWhat the president has done is advance the budgeting process, his administration now on board. His White House isn\u2019t the first to seek less for the initiative. If the Obama White House put up the initial funding, it later proposed paring back. That is when the $300 million became the standard. Yet, if anything, the restoration deserves additional resources.\nRecall how the initiative got started. It amounts to the northern version of the earlier effort to restore the Everglades in Florida. The Great Lakes restoration stemmed from scientific and other analyses revealing persistent environmental problems degrading and threatening further its ecosystem. Here is a natural treasure and economic engine, not to mention source of drinking water for tens of millions, requiring substantial help. At the start, the estimates were the restoration as a whole would cost as much as $25 billion.\nTally the past appropriations, and the total investment so far has been roughly $4 billion. In other words, there is much work ahead to reach full funding. The case for doing more rests in what has been accomplished already through more than 4,000 projects, across eight states, from improving water quality to reviving natural habitats.\nOne of the more notable achievements over the years in this part of the region involves the restoration of a portion of Tinker\u2019s Creek, along with a meadow and wetland, near the high school in Hudson. The outcome includes protection from flooding. The Mentor Marsh, along the Lake Erie shoreline, has been rescued from invasive species (a water reed) and returned to its natural ecology, including native fish and wildlife. These and the many other projects are about seeing the Great Lakes thrive and endure.\nIn that way, there are few more rewarding public investments, among other things, one generation fulfilling its obligation to the next. So it is good to see the president step up, even with his laughable claims and Congress ready to do the job, anyway."}

The open lowercase b and p (designed to avoid symmetry and confusion for some readers) make Lexia a poor choice for display purposes\u2014it just looks odd\u2014but it still works, and at least the detail in the uppercase letters adds style that Comic Sans lacks.\nAlthough Lexia Readable tries its hardest to not condescend, still pass this through the suitability filter.

A searing headache stopped him almost immediately, so painful he had to sit down.\nIt got worse. A week went by, he said, before he told the team training staff. Another week passed, and Smith continued to ache. He underwent an MRI. Doctors summoned him into a closed room.\nHis father, Shawn, joined Smith and others via phone to hear the diagnosis. A doctor said they might be scared about the news he was about to tell them.\nNine months later, after retreating from his teammates and losing his grandmother in the process, the third-year junior is back on the field for the Spartans and competing for playing time at cornerback. Chasing a football future that, at times, seemed like it was over.\nSmith took to Twitter on his 20th birthday, on May 18, and revealed that he had suffered a stroke. He said he spent about a week in the hospital before Christmas, saw a psychologist and went through mental rehabilitation before being cleared in early July to resume playing football. Doctors, Smith said, have not determined what caused it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work him into things gradually, but he's been cleared to play,\u201d Dantonio said at Big Ten media days in Chicago last month. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s started for us before, he\u2019s an experienced corner and has a good skill-set \u2026 but we'll take it slow.\"\nThe Orchard Lake St. Mary\u2019s product made 13 tackles and had four pass breakups in eight games, including four starts, for the Spartans last fall before he said a knee injury kept him out of MSU\u2019s final three games. Smith also sat out the Spartans\u2019 spring scrimmage on April 1.\nBut throughout the off-season, football meant little to Smith. The 5-foot-11, 170-pound Southfield native, the nephew of former MSU coach and current Alabama assistant Bobby Williams, struggled to process what had happened.\nBasic tasks, like remembering where he put his wallet or phone, became challenges. Lessons he learned in class disappeared almost immediately. Smith went through a number of tests for people who have experienced strokes, and he said doctors were amazed that he was still walking and talking normally. Playing football again remained an uncertainty and far from his primary focus.\nSmith said he retreated from his teammates, taking comfort in his family. He said his mother, Kim, had an aneurysm \u201ca few years back.\u201d She helped keep her son moving forward and motivated in the healing process.\nThen, during his recovery, Smith\u2019s grandmother died, and \u201cI just felt like everything stopped for a moment. \u2026 Everything was all out the window, and I kind of went into a shell and went in my room.\u201d They never told his grandmother about his stroke, either.\nSmith spent his time away from football doing anything he could on campus away from the game, whether it was a campus organization brunch meetup or a book club or a movie. Life away from football became a distinct possibility.\n\u201cThe major (lesson) that I really thought about in the hospital, is that time waits for nobody,\u201d he said. \u201cJust sitting there, seeing who all comes around, seeing who all doesn\u2019t come around, time really doesn\u2019t wait for (anybody).

Prospective students often wonder, \u201cIs the experience online the same as on-campus?\u201d Or, \u201cWill the format fit my lifestyle?\u201d Roughly 5.8 million students are now enrolled in at least one online course, though, and that number is growing\u2014as are the benefits of learning virtually.\nToday\u2019s workforce is moving online. Forty-six percent of organizations recently surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management said they use virtual teams. With that, the number of professionals who regularly work from home has increased 115 percent over the last decade, with more than 3.7 million employees working remotely at least half the time.\nLearning online helps prepare professionals for this shift in the workforce. Yet that advantage is just one of many. Here\u2019s a look at the benefits of earning a master\u2019s degree online.\nBy earning your master\u2019s degree online, you can learn on your own schedule. Rather than leave the office early or skip family dinner to commute to campus, you\u2019re logging on when it\u2019s convenient for you\u2014at a time that doesn\u2019t interfere with other commitments. That flexibility allows you to more easily balance work, life, and graduate school.\nStudents don\u2019t always feel comfortable asking professors to repeat a point they made in their last lecture or dive into deeper detail on a specific topic. When learning online, you can revisit past material or stop the lecture to perform additional research or organize your notes. You can work through the lesson plan at your own pace to ensure you\u2019re really mastering the material before moving on to the next section.\nA benefit of an online program is that students can tune in from anywhere around the world. Because of that, class discussions feature a broader range of perspectives, helping you enhance your own cross-cultural understanding. If you\u2019re interested in entrepreneurship, for example, hearing how other countries adopt certain technologies or approach specific industries can inspire new ideas or improve an existing concept you\u2019ve been developing.\nWith more companies using virtual teams, it\u2019s important to learn how to collaborate remotely. Your classmates will likely live in different time zones, which you need to learn how to adapt to and schedule around.\nSkype: The video conferencing software lets you speak face-to-face with your peers.\nDropbox: Share documents with your group and keep work in one place using the file hosting service.\nSlack: The messaging platform is helpful if you need to instant message in real-time or break off into smaller groups to work on a specific part of the project.\nTrello: The project management tool enables you and your team to create, assign, track, and prioritize to-dos.\nBasecamp: Another, slightly more robust, project management tool you can use to share messages and upload files.\nMost companies today are using some combination of the software above or other programs similar. Being able to state you have project management experience and are familiar with software like Basecamp can bolster your resum\u00e9. By using these tools, not only are you learning how to collaborate remotely, you\u2019re gaining new technical skills.\nIn an online program, you\u2019re participating in discussion boards with your classmates, communicating with professors via email, and collaborating through various software programs. You want to be cognizant of your tone and grammar, so that you come across professional.

Many are subject to party rules and state laws that require them to vote based on the results of primaries and caucuses. Unbinding delegates would free them to vote their conscience at the convention at a time when Trump is mired in miserable poll numbers and facing a backlash from conservatives who don\u2019t trust him.\nEven as delegates on the call predicted victory in their uphill struggle, there were clear divisions. Lonegan emphasized that if Trump emerged from the convention as the GOP nominee, he\u2019d work to help him ensure that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t elected president. He said he\u2019d \u201cdenouce\u201d Republicans who suggested otherwise.\nBut other participants described Trump\u2019s ascendance in near-apocalyptic terms and made no pledge of support.\n\u201cDonald Trump is just about the worst candidate you can think of for the country first, and for the party second,\u201d said Gordon Humphrey, a former New Hampshire senator and an ally of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\nSteve Deace, a conservative Iowa radio host who joined the call, compared the moment to the Founding Fathers\u2019 rejection of King George III.\nLeaders of the effort, largely spearheaded by Colorado delegates Kendal Unruh and Regina Thomson, also seemed caught between projecting optimism and acknowledging that anti-Trump delegates are terrified to reveal themselves.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough time to be stealth anymore,\u201d said Unruh, whose group Free the Delegates is advocating for unbinding delegates.\nThere are signs abound that anti-Trump delegates will be wildly outnumbered and outgunned at the convention. A POLITICO survey of the 112 delegates who will write the rules of the convention \u2014 and have the first word on efforts to unbind \u2014 revealed that more than half of the committee support Trump\u2019s nomination.

Being aware of the factors involved and taking steps to address them will assist you and your family through this process.\nTo support you in understanding and managing the personal changes which you have gone through and in preparing for other changes you may encounter in your move, it is strongly recommended that you arrange a debriefing session with a Staff Counsellor. This should take place either before you leave the current mission or duty station or immediately after your arrival at your new assignment, whether this is a new office or a return to your original home.\nKnowing and understanding what sorts of reactions to expect from yourself, your partner and your family on your return will help make your reunion and reintegration a less stressful, far more enjoyable experience.\nWhile many are aware that they may experience culture shock in the initial stages of their deployment, fewer people expect difficulty readjusting to life at home after returning from assignment. A disruption of the routines you had built and cultures you had familiarized yourself with during deployment can lead to anxiety, disillusionment and frustration when transitioning back to once-familiar but now distinct behaviours and customs at home; this stress is referred to as re-entry stress/syndrome, reverse culture shock, or repatriation shock. Reverse culture shock has been observed in international aid workers, \u201cthird culture\u201d kids and military personnel and can affect both you and your family; an estimated 60 percent of humanitarian workers experience psychological and physiological stress responses after coming home. During your reintegration process, you may feel as if you no longer can relate to old friends and co-workers; interactions with others may leave you uncomfortable and disoriented, as your own personal sociocultural norms may have changed and evolved during your time abroad. Re-entry stress is best managed by psychologically preparing yourself for the difficulties you may experience upon returning home. Reflecting on the ways in which you have changed and the stress management techniques you find most effective can help you to cope during the reintegration phase.

Stock: Back Above $100, Is It Still a Buy?\nAfter Apple reported first-quarter results in late January, the stock fell to a 52-week low of $92. Shares were looking particularly attractive after the sell-off. But the stock has since rebounded to above $100, trading at about $102 at the time of this writing. Is the stock still a buy at these levels?\nValuationA quick glance at Apple stock would likely lead most investors to agree that shares appear to be cheap. Of course, a cheap-looking stock isn&apos;t always a great investment. A conservative valuation should be paired with a solid business before it starts to look like a good investment candidate.\nNevertheless, valuation is not only a great starting point -- but its an essential element to consider when making any investment.\nOn this note, two metrics, in particular, highlight undervalued nature of Apple stock.\nPrice-to-earnings: While a price-to-earnings ratio isn&apos;t always a useful barometer for gaining insight into a stock&apos;s valuation, it does provide perspective for matured businesses. For companies with a stable level of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, and fairly consistent gross profit margins, a price-to-earnings ratio provides a window into the market&apos;s sentiment toward a stock&apos;s growth prospects.\nFree cash flow yield: Another way to look at Apple&apos;s valuation is to consider the company&apos;s free cash flow yield. Free cash flow yield refers to the cold hard cash generated from regular operations less capital expenditures as a percentage of market capitalization. The higher Apple&apos;s free cash flow yield, the more conservatively the stock is valued.\nApple&apos;s free cash flow yield is nearly 11%, near the highest levels it has been in the last five years -- and well above other tech giants such as Microsoft and Alphabet, which have free cash flow yields of about 6% and 3%, respectively.\n2 big catalysts for growthSo, Apple stock appears cheap by traditional valuation metrics. But is its business about to spin into a decline? After all, with Apple guiding for a year-over-year decline in revenue for the current quarter, the tech giant&apos;s new iPhone 6s lineup looks poised to fail to outsell its iPhone 6 lineup from the year prior.\nFortunately for investors, there are two key reasons Apple&apos;s EPS should be able to continue to grow at rates beyond inflation over the long haul.\n1. Share repurchases. With more than $1 of $5 dollars of Apple&apos;s revenue consistently making it to the company&apos;s bottom line, the tech giant should be able to continue to repurchase its own shares aggressively for years to come. As long as the stock trades conservatively, these repurchases will build shareholder value and boost EPS.\n2. A loyal customer base. Apple is known for its loyal customer base. This reality is illustrated both by high levels of customer satisfaction for its products and Apple&apos;s industry-leading pricing power across all of its product categories. And loyalty does more than retain current customers. It helps with growth, too, since new customers are more likely to stick around with Apple&apos;s brand and buy future products than new customers to a less loyal brand would be. In other words, Apple can more likely retain the leftover customers from less-loyal brands if those users try Apple products.\nOther potential catalysts for Apple include low penetration of LTE devices in"}
{"idx": "9262", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Syracuse, N.Y. -- The cord had to be cut quickly to minimize the inevitable discomfort.\nWhen Madison Smith visited Vermont last summer and loved the school, she knew that's where she was going to play college basketball starting in the fall of 2019.\nShe texted her triplet sister and West Genesee teammate Mackenzie with the news (They also have a triplet brother, Max, a player on the Wildcats boys team.). Since they were drawing interest from different colleges, it wasn't that much of a surprise that the seniors would be splitting up after a lifetime of playing together.\nBut to make it official so quickly, that was jarring.\nIt's all working out for both players, since Mackenzie wound up landing a spot in the Old Dominion program. And between now and then, there's nearly a full season of Wildcats basketball to enjoy.\nThey opened their senior years in strong fashion on Nov. 30 in a win over CBA. Madison, a shooting guard/small forward, posted 23 points and Mackenzie, a point guard, tossed in 18.\nBut after more than a dozen years of basketball sisterhood, the end is finally very much in sight. And the sisters know it.\nMackenzie and Madison have always had each other's back. Their mother, Cindy, recalled when Madison was 2 she drank the liquid from a plug-in room freshener.\nMadison had a bad reaction but fearful of being punished she hid under a small slide and wouldn't tell her parents what she ingested. Mackenzie crawled under the slide and convinced Madison to share that information, making treatment much easier when an ambulance arrived.\nCindy said to this day Mackenzie reminds Madison how she saved her life, even though the sisters' exact memory of the incident is hazy at best.\nThe sisters played with each other on youth teams and in more informal moments took their competitiveness to the driveway, where they'd dunk over each other on a mini-basket. The disagreements were minimal.\n\"Maybe like a few punches. That's it, really. Or a few yells. Nothing like tackling. Nothing bad,'' Madison said.\nMackenzie Smith (left) and Madison at age 11.\nMackenzie developed the fearlessness that allowed her to yell at her sister on the court when needed, while nary ever saying a cross word to other teammates.\n\"She yells at me to push me. It's not like she's against me or anything. It's just to push me because she knows what I'm capable of. I respond by playing harder,'' Madison said.\nThe sisters both reached the varsity as freshmen. Madison has averaged improved from 8.9, 11.8 and 14.2 points per game her three seasons, respectively, while Mackenzie has climbed from 5.9 to 9.6 to 13.6. They've helped take the Wildcats to back-to-back Section III Class AA titles.\nMinor squabbling apart, the basketball wavelength between the two has been of the strength you'd expect of sisters.\nEventually the two realized that as tough as it would be to have high school mark the end of their shared basketball careers, that's how it would play out.\n\"We did talk about it. We realize that we can't live together and go the same way for our whole lives. So we both agree that it'd probably be best if we just went our own"}

Master client refers to an intermediary or go-between, which helps a client set up an offshore entity.\nWhile UBS AG\u2019s London unit helped Mallya set up Venture New Holding in BVI in 2006, the bank\u2019s Singapore unit was the master client of Lohia\u2019s Golden Charm Universal, a BVI-based standard international company.\nAmong other Indian clients who used the services of UBS AG\u2019s Singapore unit to set up offshore entities are Mumbai-based couple Sachin and Richa Karpe. Sachin and Richa were shareholders and directors of Capital Alps Universal, set up in BVI in 2006. The Offshore Leaks Database showed the entity\u2019s status as \u201cstruck/defunct/deregistered\u201d, suggesting the company might not be active any longer.\nIn 2006, Sachin Karpe was working with UBS wealth management\u2019s Asia desk handling Indian clients.\nSachin Karpe was fired by UBS in 2008 and was penalised by the UK\u2019s financial regulator, Financial Services Authority, for aiding an Indian corporate group and its illegal offshore vehicles to invest in Indian securities in violation of regulation.\nSachin Karpe did not respond to an email questionnaire asking about the objective of setting up Capital Alps sent on Sunday and a subsequent reminder.\nPanday also referred to a statement made by The Portcullis TrustNet Group, which he described as \u201can external service provider engaged by individuals who have planning needs\u201d. Portcullis appears as the record and register keepers of these offshore entities.\nThe Portcullis statement said in a statement on its website it \u201chas identified an individual whom it strongly suspects as having been involved in the data theft that has led to information being published in a series of articles coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. A report has been filed with the Royal Virgin Islands Police Force, and they are investigating the matter\u201d.\nIn several offshore entities that UBS helped set up, a company called Sharecorp Ltd acted as nominee shareholder. A nominee company acts on behalf of the beneficial owner of an entity to provide an extra level of secrecy, according to the database.\nSharecorp is nominee shareholder of at least 50 Indians and holds stake in a few hundred offshore entities, according to the database. Sharecorp was a nominee shareholder in both Mallya\u2019s and Lohia\u2019s offshore companies.\nEighteen entities based in Mumbai, 13 in Delhi, three in Kolkata and two in Chennai used Sharecorp as a nominee shareholder in their offshore entities. Sharecorp itself is a standard international company incorporated in BVI in April 1996. Portcullis Trustnet and Singapore-based David Chong Kok Kong were listed as Sharecorp\u2019s shareholders."}

But many still thought the Seawolves would be competitive for the conference title, especially after the team&apos;s 20-10 win over Villanova in the first round of the 2012 postseason.\nThe Seawolves suffered a huge setback after two games when starting running back Marcus Coker was lost for the remainder of the season with an abdominal injury.\nAt 2-3, the Wolves aren&apos;t statistically out of the playoff hunt just yet. But with losses to CAA teams Villanova and Towson already, and a schedule that includes New Hampshire, Maine, Richmond and James Madison, the scenario isn&apos;t looking too sunny in the team&apos;s first CAA season.\nJust as, or maybe even more surprising than Stony Brook&apos;s rough start to the 2013 season, has been Colgate&apos;s start.\nThe Raiders already have accumulated more losses this season than all of last year, with some obvious defensive lapses. The Raiders have allowed 37 points to Albany, 53 to New Hampshire and 39 to Yale.\nWalter Payton Award candidate Gavin McCarney, the unquestioned leader of this Raiders offense, has had periods of injury this year, causing him to miss playing time.\nFortunately for Colgate, the Patriot League schedule hasn&apos;t started up yet. If the Raiders can mend their problems before Oct. 19 when the team travels to Worcester, Mass., for a game with Holy Cross, then the team can right the ship.\nThe Seawolves and Raiders square off Saturday at Colgate in a contest of two underachieving former champions.

The increases have forced many employees to look to the voluntary market to fill the gaps.\nLTD plans offered on a voluntary basis mean that employees, not the employer, incur 100 percent of the premium. Employees last year saw fit to put off the coverage.\n\u201cDespite increased consumer confidence, many employers and wage earners seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward benefit expenditures, a possible result of economic uncertainty and the fear of continually rising health care costs,\u201d Lundquist said.\nLTD coverage replaces a portion of an employee\u2019s lost income due to a disability. Large employers offer the coverage.\nCompared with regular health insurance premiums, disability insurance premiums are a bargain. Offered to employees at group rates, LTD premiums amount to just a few dollars a month.\nLast year, insurance carriers paid out $9.8 billion in disability claims payments, a 1.6 percent increase over 2012, the survey also found.\nJust under 150,000 new individuals were approved for LTD benefits in 2013, the analysis found, with 54 percent of new LTD claims coming from these diagnostic categories: musculoskeletal, nervous system-related, cardiovascular/circulatory, and cancer and neoplasms, the CDA said."}

Uncapped wells, still burning months after the war\u2019s end, send great plumes of oily smoke across the horizon.\nFirst, I think that the body of the tank looks remarkably, and fittingly, like an SLR camera, but then my imagination goes to the fate of the Iraqi crew that was caught in an explosion so powerful that a turret and gun weighing perhaps tens of thousands of kilograms were blown clean off.\nWhat is seen and what is imagined come together, soberingly. The effect is amplified by Ristelhueber\u2019s mixing aerial and ground photographs, leaving viewers to figure out if their perspective is \u201c50 centimetres from the sand, like the patterns you do in the sand as a kid on the beach, or if you\u2019re up in the air,\u201d she says.\nThis causes disorientation. One photo that I was certain was aerial was, she informs me, taken inches from the ground. \u201cGood,\u201d Ristelhueber adds, \u201cit\u2019s working.\u201d She wants the viewer to think about perspective, about how our expectations influence how we see things.\nShe\u2019s been working in war zones since Beirut in the 1980s, and later in Iraq, and on the West Bank.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a specialist of war, it\u2019s not that. My concern is, the obsession is, the activity of men on Earth, the construction-destruction. This is the movement that fascinates me, and war is one of the aspects of this movement,\u201d says Ristelhueber, who came from Paris to install Fait in Ottawa.\nHer work has been shown in major galleries, including MoMA in New York, and last year at the Tate Modern in London, where Fait was hung on four walls. At the National Gallery, the photographs are for the first time hung on one wall, and I imagine that at the Tate, on all four walls, it was a sense of being surrounded by the degradation of war, while in Ottawa the effect is more an endless parade of war through history, with the landscape as collateral damage.\nThe National Gallery is the first to buy the complete set of 71 photographs, and they are seen now for the first time in Ottawa.

The listing is a bit of a surprise since General Stroessner has been unavailable to take calls for two years. A coup on Feb. 3,1989, ended his 35 years as Paraguay's generalissimo and dispatched him to exile in Brazil.\nLook under \"R,\" and there is as yet no entry for Gen. Andr 142&amp;gt;s Rodriguez Pedotti, the man who led the coup and the country's current president. It is, some say, an all-too-obvious sign of the political paralysis left by Stroessner's iron-fisted rule. Opposition party leaders complain that Stroessner's dominant National Republican Association-Colorado Party is still cemented in power.\n\"The Rodriguez coup basically happened to adapt the Stroessner system to modern times,\" observes Rafael Saguier, a leading member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA), Paraguay's main opposition party. \"Stroessner was way out of date.\"\nYet there have been changes in the last two years, some of them significant.\nGone, of course, are the ubiquitous, smiling portraits of Stroessner, used to promote a personality cult - and his political longevity. In his time, Stroessner was the longest-surviving head of state in the Western hemisphere. He came to power in May 1954, when Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States, and nearly five years before Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution.\nThe country's main airport, formerly the Presidente Stroessner, has been renamed after Paraguay's first pilot. And the second city, formerly (you've guessed it) Presidente Stroessner, is now Ciudad del Este (City of the East).\nMore important to Paraguayans, General Rodr 146&amp;gt;guez has broken with tradition and promised to hand power to an elected successor in August 1993. In 180 years of post-independence history, no president has ever given the sash to the opposition by way of the ballot box.\nCoaxed along by his regular tennis partner, US Ambassador Timothy Towell, Rodriguez has mostly stuck to his post-coup promise of respecting human rights. A notable exception has been his harsh treatment of peasant protesters.\nYet opposition politicians accustomed to plotting from exile or prison now openly criticize the regime - without getting arrested. The press has also been unmuzzled.\n\"The Rodriguez government has achieved 20 percent of what it promised. Its worst error is that the process of democratization hasn't been planned,\" says Euclides Acevedo, head of the opposition social-democratic February Revolutionary Party. \"The protagonists of the democratic process, the popular movement and social organizations, have not been asked to take part. Everything remains in the hands of the government and the Colorado Party.\"\nAlthough the opposition is outspoken, its effectiveness has been hampered by the tendency of parties to devolve into grupitos - small groups where personal ambition far outweighs ideological or policy differences.\nTwo Paraguayan political sociologists interviewed about party splits spent an hour arguing whether the governing Colorado Party had broken into nine or 10 fa"}

You can use small paper cups to start parsley seeds indoors for later transplanting, or you can use a larger plastic cup to grow the plant to maturity. Parsley requires a container approximately 6 inches deep to send out sufficient roots once it reaches its full size. The herb grows well indoors in a sunny window sill or as a fall or early spring plant in mild climates.\nPoke two or three drainage holes in the bottom of the cup with a nail. Set the cup on a tray to collect any water that drains from the soil.\nFill the cup to within 1/2 inch of the rim with a sterile potting mixture. Water the mixture until it feels evenly moist. Empty any water that collects in the tray.\nSow two parsley seeds on top the soil. Cover the seeds with a 1/4-inch layer of soil and set it in a warm place. Covering the cup with a plastic bag retains moisture so the parsley won't require watering until after it sprouts.\nRemove the bag once the seeds germinate. Provide the parsley with full sunlight and water it when the soil's surface feels dry.\nThin the seedlings so only the strongest parsley plant remains in the cup. Water the remaining seedling with an all-purpose fertilizer diluted to a quarter of the label recommended amount.\nWater mature plants when the soil has begun to dry but before it dries out completely. Indoor plants usually need two or three waterings per week, while outdoor plants may require daily watering.\nHarvest the parsley leaves as needed once the plants are at least 6 inches tall and fully leafed out. Cut individual sprigs with shears, leaving the rest of the plant to continue growing.\nWhen you grow parsley in small paper cups for garden transplants, transplant them to their permanent garden bed once the seedlings are about 3 or 4 inches tall.\nParsley requires little fertilization. If the container grown plants are producing poorly or the leaves appear yellow, make a second application of the diluted fertilizer solution.\nHarrington, Jenny. \"How to Grow Parsley in a Cup.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-parsley-cup-29306.html.

At the heart of Tim Keller\u2019s ministry at Redeemer Presbyterian in Manhattan is a vision of the city, so at the heart of that ministry is an understanding of \u201ccontextualization.\u201d You can find his most recent summary of his thoughts in Center Church: Doing Balanced, Gospel-Centered Ministry in Your City. His discussions are in Parts 3-5 in the book.\nThis discussion is rooted 100% in one\u2019s view of the relationship of kingdom and church, as well as the relation of church to state and culture. His approach is the Reformed model, which is a hopeful but realistic conviction that the gospel can influence and even transform society and culture. The origins of this view in America is probably John Winthrop and the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the most successful model \u2014 perhaps \u2014 was worked out by Abraham Kuyper in the Netherlands.\nWhat do you think of Keller\u2019s definition of contextualization and his understanding of contextualizing? What about that list of motives for responding to the gospel: Thoughts? Observations? Additions?\nWhen it comes to contextualization, my ear first gravitates to pastors and parents. Since Keller has \u201csucceeded\u201d in speaking into the City culture, I\u2019m keen on our all listening to his ideas.\nKeller goes where few are willing to go: he defines contextualization. Here it is: Contextualization \u201cis giving people the Bible\u2019s answers \u2026 to questions about life \u2026 in language and forms they can comprehend, and through appeals and arguments with force they can feel\u201d (89). I reduced a few expressions: people may not want the Bible\u2019s answers but the Bible does speak to questions people are asking.\nContextualizing then believes the baseline narratives of our culture find resolution in the Jesus. He understands culture broadly and the gospel comes to expression in a culture in a way that it makes sense of culture and is faithful to the gospel. He sees two seemingly completely separable factors at work: gospel and culture. Many would say the two, while distinguishable, are not completely separable. His concern is not permitting gospel to be swallowed by culture, and he points to universalism, liberation theology and Protestant liberalism. Syncretism most often occurs in the church when not all of the Bible is being taught.\nThis of course raises the issue again of how cultural the Bible is. He relies on Carson here: \u201cWhile no truth which humans beings may articulate can ever be articulated in a culture-transcending way \u2026 that does not mean that the truth thus articulated does not transcend culture\u201d (93). All expressions of the gospel are cultural expressions but the truth of that gospel can transcend the culture.\nKeller explores John Stott\u2019s famous bridge model for contextualization: one side is the Bible, the other side is culture, and the preacher/preaching/communication is the bridge from the Bible to culture. Keller sees help in this but thinks it makes the two sides too equal. The Bible is authoritative. He prefers the spiral over the bridge. I\u2019m not sure there is anything in the spiral image that gives the Bible more authority than the bridge model.\nFinally, perhaps this is clear from seeing how Romans 1 shows us that culture is a mixed bag of good and bad, that our motive (1 Cor 9:19-23) is gospeling but it can be full of adaptations,"}

And while the upgrading the drainage system is likely necessary, the panel suggests a quick fix to Singapore: require rooftop gardens on all new and retrofitted buildings. Rooftop gardens don't just add beauty to the city, they can also play a big role in mitigating floods by reducing and slowing stormwater runoff and filtering pollutants.\nThese measures are to be complemented with diversion canals, storage tanks along \"pathways\" of drains, drain capacity improvements, and finally, flood barriers, raised platform levels - some of which is already being done, but \"could be carried further\", noted Prof Balmforth.\nThe panel also suggested storage tanks, rain gardens, and porous pavement."}

For some, it comes true. For others, it drives them to keep trying.\nFor Donte DiVincenzo, becoming a first-round pick in the NBA Draft isn\u2019t a dream come true, it\u2019s the last box checked on a prediction made several years ago.\nDuring his junior year at Salesianum, he told one of his coaches that he wanted to win a state championship, become player of the year, win a national championship in college and be a first-round pick in the NBA.\nFour years later, DiVincenzo finds himself with each of those goals accomplished after the Milwaukee Bucks chose him with the No. 17 pick in the NBA Draft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been a whirlwind, honestly,\u201d DiVincenzo said.\nBefore the Bucks picked him in June, DiVincenzo won a national title with Villanova in March, declared for the draft in April, and had a standout performance at the NBA Combine in May.\nSince then, he\u2019s gone through the gauntlet that comes with being one of the first 30 names called in Brooklyn: media requests, official introductions, even throwing out the first pitch at a Milwaukee Brewers game.\nNow, he has a little time to focus on what has brought him so much attention.\nIt seemed like nothing could slow DiVincenzo down, but a right groin injury has kept him out of Milwaukee\u2019s first three summer league games. DiVincenzo said he suffered the injury a few weeks ago and has received treatment since arriving in Milwaukee.\nAlthough he expressed his desire to put on a Bucks uniform and play in Las Vegas, the time off has allowed him to take a step away and begin to adjust to the professional game.\nWhether or not DiVincenzo suits up in Las Vegas, he\u2019ll gun for a spot in the rotation as the season draws closer. A summer league debut pales in comparison to a regular season one, but before that happens, DiVincenzo has something that has seemed rare since the national championship game: time. His plan on how he wants to use that time is simple.\nAs his profile grew throughout the NCAA Tournament, so did the popularity of his \u201cMichael Jordan of Delaware\u201d moniker, which Villanova head coach Jay Wright gave him as a nod to his \u201crock star\u201d status in high school.\nBrendan Haley, DiVincenzo\u2019s coach at Salesianum, said Wright had concerns about whether he would have to deal with a big ego once DiVincenzo arrived at Villanova, but that was far from the case. In fact, Wright believes the attention he received while at Salesianum helps DiVincenzo handle the hype.\nWhen it comes to representing the state of Delaware, Wright said DiVincenzo takes pride in being from Delaware but has a \u201creally narrow focus\u201d on the goal in front of him. Haley said his former star embraces the responsibility and believes DiVincenzo doesn\u2019t think about it too much.\nThe amount of support he receives from the local community surprised the coach, considering DiVincenzo played for what Haley proclaimed as the \u201cevil empire\u201d at Salesianum.\nAnything that can make a rookie\u2019s transition easier is critical to early success, including having others to share that experience.

Each week brings reports of derailments, delays or schedule changes. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, however, that commuters north of the city are also hurting from the insufficient investment in the regional mass transit network. Metro-North and its counterpart regional bus services require attention now if the area is to produce meaningful economic and job growth.\nNeglecting Metro-North riders has already cost us.\nJust recently, the National Transportation Safety Board found that a misaligned track contributed to a derailment in May on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven Line in Rye that injured 14 people. A derailment on the Metro-North Harlem Line in Valhalla killed six people\u2014four of them my constituents\u2014in 2015 when a train collided with a car on the tracks, and since then not a single at-grade Metro-North crossing has been eliminated (while seven are slated for removal on Long Island). In 2013, four people were killed and more than 60 injured in Spuyten-Duyvil when a speeding Hudson Line train derailed, an accident that may have been prevented if positive train control had been in place.\nMetro-North is only now getting close to implementing positive train control, technology that automates speed control and reduces the potential for human error that can cause train accidents. The railroad\u2019s target is full implementation next year, a full 10 years after President George W. Bush signed a law requiring positive train control for all railroads. Fulfilling a federal safety mandate is the bare minimum of improvements needed for mass transit in the northern suburbs; making more improvements to public transportation is necessary for the long-term economic vitality of the lower Hudson Valley.\nIn addition to Metro-North, bus service is also a crucial component of the area\u2019s economic infrastructure. Nowhere is this more evident than with the forthcoming Lower Hudson Transit Link. This rapid-transit bus line will travel along the I-287 corridor, connecting Rockland County destinations as far west as Suffern with Westchester County. Phase One of the Transit Link will take passengers as far east as White Plains and is set for completion by fall 2018 at a cost of somewhat over $100 million. Phase Two has just been kickstarted by the state Assembly with $13.5 million to extend the line east to Port Chester, giving Westchester and Rockland riders their first ever complete east-west mass transit option.\nProjects like these demonstrate that transportation officials can sustain and improve conditions for commuters in New York\u2019s northern suburbs without spending billions, even though billion-dollar megaprojects are routine elsewhere in the metropolitan area. The estimated cost to rebuild Penn Station is upward of $3 billion, a new Port Authority Bus Terminal is likely to cost $10 billion, while the cost of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River to New York and New Jersey is nearly $13 billion. Adding a third track to the Long Island Rail Road between Floral Park and Hicksville will cost $2 billion, while the latest estimate for the East Side Access project, which will provide LIRR service to Grand Central Terminal, is more than $10 billion (over $7 billion of which has already been spent).\nMeaningful Metro-North projects have a much smaller price tag. Some, like connecting Metro-North\u2019s New Haven line to Penn Station, a $695 million cost, are planned. But others, such as connecting the Hudson Line to Penn"}

But Disbro cautioned that there are several critical items a board must consider prior to engaging in mediation.\n\"A mediator's job is not to determine a 'winner' and a 'loser' but instead bring the two parties together,\" said Disbro. \"Because of this, there must be Board consensus going in as to what they are and are not willing to give up as part of a negotiated settlement, and what is the minimum they must gain in order to qualify it a success.\"\nAdditional considerations Disbro suggested: \"Association boards must be clear as to who is empowered to represent them at the bargaining table, and have absolute confidence that that person understands and can effectively execute the will of the Board throughout the mediation process.\"\nOther recommendations included ensuring that the mediator understands all facts of the case as well as the history of dispute not only between the parties but on similar issues within the community.\n\"Never assume,\" Disbro stressed regarding a mediator's understanding of details in a dispute.\nCAI Legal Forum: California Communities is a special, one-day event hosted by the Community Associations Institute addressing key legal topics affecting California's community managers and homeowners.

{"idx": "9314", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has in the credit policy statement signalled its intent to revamp the business of priority sector lending\u2014a euphemism for subsidized and targeted lending to the less privileged.\nTaking up the recommendation of the Raghuram Rajan committee on financial sector reforms, RBI is setting up a working group to create priority sector lending certificates (PSLC). All entities lending to the so-called priority sector will be covered; any surplus beyond the stipulated limits for each entity can be sold to those who are in deficit. Something akin to what we have seen in the case of a carbon credit market.\nOn the face of it, the scheme makes a lot of sense and will presumably inject more efficiency into the business of priority sector lending. At present, not all banks have the reach or the requisite skills to understand the associated risks. Further, many banks are handicapped by a limited branch network; as a result, they either risk defaulting on their obligations or getting saddled with a bad debt. A vibrant PSLC market will ensure that this does not happen. It should also encourage specialization\u2014which is a good thing, especially given the nature of the business.\nIt is an improvement on the inter-bank participation certificates introduced by RBI in 1988. Under this, a bank acquires the assets of another bank and holds it for 180 days to make up any shortfall in its priority sector lending target of 40%. However, since the risk of a bad loan falls on the acquirer, the scheme has not had many takers.\nThe scheme may be good, but it does not address the core issue underlying priority sector lending. It is more than four decades since the concept was launched in 1967-68\u2014immediately after the economy went into a downturn and the government in its wisdom decided to direct more lending to sectors such as agriculture and the small-scale industry. The notion has undergone several revisions, with the government altering targets and sub-targets under different priority sectors. It has now become a gigantic scheme that suffers from gross inefficiencies. Moreover, the economy, too, today is vastly different\u2014both in quantitative terms as well as structurally.\nBut does the government have the political will to address the problem?"}

The news comes in conjunction with the release of the 2012 update on the world\u2019s bird species for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, data for which is compiled and updated every four years by conservation group BirdLife International.\nAmong the species at risk in the Amazon are the now-critically endangered Rio Branco antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria), which was listed as \u201cNear Threatened\u201d just four years ago. According to BirdLife, the species has a very small range in Brazil and Guyana. The construction of new roads in the antbird\u2019s habitat has made it easier to clear land for cattle ranching and soy production. According to current projections, the antbird\u2019s habitat will disappear completely in 20 years.\nBirdLife also downgraded the hoary-throated spinetail (Synallaxis kollari) from the same Rio Branco region of Brazil and Guyana from \u201cEndangered\u201d to \u201cCritically Endangered.\u201d The organization says the bird has just 206 square kilometers of suitable habitat, which could shrink 83.5 percent in the next 11 years.\nOnly two species had their Red List categories improved in this update. One of them, the Rarotonga monarch (Pomarea dimidiata), has been upgraded from \u201cEndangered\u201d to \u201cVulnerable.\u201d Endemic to the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, the monarch was down to its last 35 to 50 birds in 1983.

The cases highlighted included one in which closet-like rooms at an elementary school in Middletown, Ct., were allegedly used to leave children alone who were said to misbehave and another in which court records indicated a 7-year-old in a New Orleans school was handcuffed.\n\"When parents are told or discover their children have been subjected to these practices, it often explains why they have seen changes in their child's temperament, behavior or learning,\" the report said.\nIt found that 18 states require parents to be notified about the use of seclusion and restraints. It said 19 states have laws that provide \"meaningful\" protections against these practices for all children and 32 do for children with disabilities.\nCommittee Chairman Tom Harkin has introduced a bill that would prohibit the practice in schools. Under it, restraints would only be allowed in emergency situations and it would prohibit leaving school children in locked, unattended rooms or enclosures. Parents would also be notified within 24 hours that a restraint had been used on their child. Harkin, D-Iowa, and Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., have unsuccessfully sought a federal law in past years to end the practice.\nIn response, national associations representing schools boards and superintendents in a joint statement said the bill would reduce the authority of states and districts.\n\"Restraint and seclusion are used as a last resort in situations that may endanger the safety and welfare of students, teachers and other school personnel,\" said the statement issued by the National School Boards Association and the School Superintendents Association. The statement said the associations agree with Harkin that the routine use of such measures is inappropriate.\nSpecial education and disability advocates generally agree that these methods should be used only in emergency situations where there's a threat of someone getting hurt. But there's evidence to suggest the methods are used more commonly than that.\nCivil rights data released from the 2009-2010 school year found tens of thousands of incidents of seclusion and restraint in U.S. schools with 70 percent of the incidents involving children with disabilities. The Senate committee staff said in the report it found 10 cases where children had been significantly injured or died due to these practices in their schools."}

Fewer than 2 in 100 take the train, the census estimates.\nYet an estimated 70 percent of people who work outside the home usually get to their jobs in 30 minutes or less, the agency estimated.\nThe report released Monday is titled the \"Census 2000 Supplementary Survey\" and based on a questionnaire distributed to 700,000 households in 1,203 counties nationwide.

Now that we have been hands-on with the Marshall London at IFA in Berlin, we are not only intrigued -- we're impressed.\nAmong those companies making devices for \"serious\" music fans over the past couple of years, the tendency has been to focus on making weighty, high-res MP3 players like Sony's NWZ-ZX1, or awkwardly pitched 'premium' devices like Neil Young's Pono Player.\nBut beyond petty point scoring, there are no awards for carrying around a bulky or ungainly device that is completely separate to your smartphone. Marshall proves that this isn't necessary -- you can have a portable, beautiful smartphone that is also tailored specifically to listening to music.\nFor a start, this phone is lighter than we expected. It's not so light that it feels cheap, but is Goldilocks-level just right. The leather feels thick and soft -- putting mainstream phone manufacturers with their \"leather-feel\" backs to shame.\nAs for the interface, it is seamlessly in tune with the phone's external design. The golden 'M' button on the top takes you straight into Marshall's music app. You can choose what to play from multiple sources -- local files, streaming services like Spotify, and so on. When you've chosen what to play and purely in listening mode, you can adjust the levels individually to tailor your listening experience.\nOur hands-on with the Marshall London took place in a pretty busy hall, but we managed to find a quiet corner to listen to the two front-facing speakers. They sound totally different (better!) to any other smartphone speakers you've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Like a gently thudding heart, the phone has proper amp-style vibrations to it.\nThe experience continues when you slip the bundled buds into your ears. Unlike most handsets, the London ships with high-quality earphones -- the Marshall Modes -- which usually retail for around \u00a360. The sound is solid, and if you so wish you can slip a second pair into the extra jack and control the volume independently using twin sliders on the screen.\nThis second jack can also be used with Marshall's DJ app. This allows you to listen to and queue music through one jack, while simultaneously feeding the queued tracks out to an amp.\nAll in all, this is a classy device with some unique features up its smart leather sleeves. If you're an audiophile, you'll no doubt want to test out its musical prowess before you invest, but rest assured that -- like the best music -- this phone is very easy to like."}

When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.\nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future.\nIn the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We\u2019ll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.\nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don\u2019t know us well. On this day, the family\u2019s bickering is put on hold.\nAs Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish.\nSo I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that\u2019s the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don\u2019t know my people. You don\u2019t know what we\u2019re capable of. You don\u2019t know what you"}

The bill was submitted by the Finance Ministry andleads to significant changes in three areas.\nThe first change to be introduced by the so-called electronic government bill concerns the conditions and methods of identification and authentication of individuals via computer. The draft bill has been aimed at making the legal norm more precise and to supplement it so that the rules of identification and authentication are applied exclusively to public administration, and thus prevent any contradictions in interpreting it, for example for use in internal communication between public administrative bodies, the ministry explained, as quoted by the TASR newswire.\nThe move will result in the introduction of authentication certificates and a central authorisation register, it added.\nThe second change concerns payments to public administration bodies which it should make easier; for example, by scrapping the accounting and pairing of payments. Changes are also going to be made with respect to registers. Source registers will undergo a change, while data referencing will also be amended.\nLegislators also accepted an amending proposal drawn up by MP R\u00f3bert Madej of the ruling Smer party regarding discounts (of 50 percent) on fees for judicial administration when these are processed electronically. This aims to increase electronization (the process of moving from paper-based to digital systems) in Slovakia, with every ordinary citizen attracted to submit electronic applications by being offered a discount, according to Madej. The deputy added that many companies like banks, building societies and non-banking financial institutions do not require such a discount because they are bulk-buying claims and bulk-reclaiming them in the courts, often in an unsubstantiated, unlawful and bullying manner. To prevent this, every petitioner will have the right to submit five claims a year to a particular court with a 50-percent discount."}

{"idx": "9352", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: How Does Exercise Lower Blood Pressure?\nAlthough high blood pressure is common, its causes are unknown. High blood pressure occurs when the arteries are narrow or constricted, making your heart work harder to supply oxygen to your body. You can have high blood pressure for years without suffering any physical symptoms. However, high blood pressure can lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, which is why it\u2019s important to be proactive about bringing high blood pressure down.\nMany medications exist for lowering high blood pressure, but you may prefer to take a more natural approach to lowering blood pressure. Exercise can work as well as many medications for lowering blood pressure, and there are no unpleasant side effects. Moreover, exercise can increase overall health, including regulating moods and sleep patterns. You may choose exercise alone to treat high blood pressure or in combination with dietary changes, medication or other lifestyle adjustments.\nExercise strengthens your heart, which means your heart doesn\u2019t have to work as hard to supply blood and oxygen to your body. When your heart isn\u2019t working as hard, the stress on your arteries is less, lowering your blood pressure. In addition, exercise helps control your weight, which is another factor that contributes to high blood pressure. In some cases, regular exercise is enough to lower blood pressure without medication.\nThe beneficial effects of exercise only continue as long as you keep up an exercise routine, so exercise must become part of your life to treat high blood pressure long term. Although strengthening and stretching exercises such as weight training or yoga have other health benefits, you must include aerobic exercise in your regimen to lower blood pressure. Aerobic exercise includes swimming, jumping rope, walking, jogging, biking, climbing stairs or anything else that gets your heart beating faster.\nExercise doesn\u2019t have to take over your life for you to see and feel its benefits. You should include at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise in your daily routine. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to join a gym or sign up for aerobics classes, although these may be helpful in maintaining your motivation. Vacuuming the floor, climbing steps and taking brisk walks are all aerobic.\nIf exercise isn\u2019t a regular part of your life, make sure to increase your physical activity gradually. Also, talk to your physician if you\u2019ve had a heart attack or other heart conditions or if you\u2019re beginning an exercise routine after the age of 40. In addition, stop activity and consult your doctor if you experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or dizziness or fainting. By staying safe, you can access the considerable health benefits of exercise with little to no unpleasant side effects.\nLacey Louwagie has been a professional writer and editor for seven years.

If so, you may be interested in a new Kickstarter project, which promises to bring coaster fans the most realistic, physics-accurate miniature roller coaster kit yet, compatible with regular Lego blocks.\nThe creation is the work of Jack Rimer and Michael Graham, who together make up the company CoasterDynamix. In their regular working lives, Rimer, Graham and engineer Dan Linden create mini roller coasters as prototypes for theme parks wanting to show off their latest attraction.\nThis necessitates making model coasters which act like their larger life-size counterparts.

Put these together \u2014 which you do in any formation you can dream up \u2014 and you have everything you need to build a four-foot long working roller coaster model.

So why not extend it to casting as well,\" she says.\n\"It merely enables you to make a more informed judgment and decision. The call is not based entirely on gut. You're engaging your end-consumer in deciding, what they are eventually paying for.\"\nSince Genelia was one of their choices for the role, Ekta is all the more glad that the people also voted for her.\nIncidentally, this is the second time an actor has been finalised in such a manner.

And Sharman topped the poll.\"\nInterestingly, surveys in Bollywood started with producers showing their films to small focus groups to gauge the audience response.\nSiddharth Roy Kapoor, CEO of a film production house, says that if a considerable number of people from different groups give similar reaction, then it makes sense to take note of it.\n\"We're involved in the film as producers. We might overlook something that an audience can point out,\" he says. \"We're making the movie for the audience. So it's important to know what consumers think of the product,\" he adds.\nShika Kapoor, marketing director of a film production states that research is not just for consumer feedback, but also to improve the product. \"It is used to figure out how the audience is comprehending the film and their acceptance levels. If the film is huge, then knowing audience opinion comes in handy,\" she says.\nSometimes, reverse casting makes more sense, feels Siddharth Roy Kapoor. He elaborates, \"There are times when you could get a clich \ufffdd response from the people about who they want to see in a film.\nThat's when casting against the type helps better. The person you least expect to be in a particular character, might just surprise you more than the person you expect to fit that part.\"\nEkta adds, \"There's no such thumb rule. Films that are designed for a specific kind of audience or in situations where one is not entirely sure whether A works better or B. Research comes in handy.\""}

State and federal monitors said air quality was safe, but environmental groups disagreed and said they would conduct their own monitoring.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said there was an increase in soot and other contaminants at ground levels around the site but levels remained below those considered unhealthy. Monitoring by an Environmental Protection Agency aircraft also found \"no significant detections,\" the EPA said.\nThe tanks hold flammable liquids that are difficult to extinguish using water and foam suppressants. Five of the 15 tanks continued to burn Tuesday, while two have collapsed and volatile liquids in three others burned out, ITC said.\nA local fire official said the blaze may have to burn itself out. Each tank holds 80,000 barrels, or up to 3.3 million gallons, of liquids that are used to boost gasoline octane, make solvents and plastics.\nGasoline prices on the Colonial pipeline, which sends fuel to the U.S. East Coast from Houston, were up on Tuesday between 1- and 2-cents a gallon over levels prior to the fire.\n\"I can't tell you how long it will take to burn out,\" said Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen at a morning briefing. \"I'm not going to give you a timetable.\"\nPumps on two boats feeding water to firefighters malfunctioned for about six hours on Monday evening, he said.

Gary Elkins, a Republican. It would give the Department of Public Safety control of red-light camera systems and ban the renewal of local contracts. The House backed the proposal, the Senate opposed it, and the dueling versions go to a conference committee for resolution.\nHouston has one of the most successful red-light camera programs in the state, with 70 cameras at 50 intersections. More than $10 million has been generated for traffic-safety programs here and $8.3 million for trauma care in the state. The cameras photograph the license plates of motorists who run red lights and the drivers receive $75 citations in the mail.\nAs Houston drivers and pedestrians know, red-light running is endemic and dangerous. Local authorities are justified in trying to protect their citizens with effective public-safety systems.\nLegislators have attempted to ban the cameras in previous sessions and failed. In 2007 a compromise measure limited fines that could be assessed and mandated that the proceeds be split between cities and a state fund for hospital care.\nIn a defensive move, Houston and other cities with red-light cameras have extended contracts with their operators.

Inner City Press asked first, then a follow up was put in last week.\nIn this incident, six of the seven inside the jail were from Sweden, one from the UN.

{"idx": "9363", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It would be fair to say that when I started working in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office unit dealing with engagement with the Islamic world at the beginning of 2005, I did not have a great deal of knowledge about British Muslim politics. I had no particular reason to question the office's process of engagement with Muslim groups.\nDoubts began to creep in when I began to help organise a Festival of Muslim Cultures to be held the following year. It was an impressive project, designed to demonstrate the full diversity of Islam around the world and enthuse young British Muslims, who had often been fed a very narrow version of their religion. But within the FCO certain individuals were sceptical about the festival's value and worried that it was not \"Islamic\" enough. It was felt that certain key organisations, such as the Muslim Council of Britain, would have to be squared off before we gave the go-ahead. I thought this was odd.\nBy the summer of 2005 I was getting seriously worried. It is impossible to overstate the effect of the London bombings. I was really shaken by the events of 7 July and they played a huge role in informing my thinking. I took a holiday in August and devoted it to reading up on political Islam and, in particular, the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's main Islamist group. The dominant view at the FCO was that it was a moderate organisation with which the UK could do business. My reading suggested otherwise, and I gradually became convinced of the totalitarian nature of its ideology. I found statements by its founder, Hassan al-Banna, glorifying death in the service of Islam, particularly disturbing.\nI also became increasingly unhappy about the activities of Mockbul Ali, the FCO's Islamic issues adviser. He had been seconded to Labour to work on the 2005 election campaign - something that raised eyebrows in the department. His relationship with the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, was thought to be close. Mockbul Ali had a habit of dismissing respected western academics as \"orientalists\" and had little time for civil servants. More seriously, he also described Islamist organisations such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its south Asian offshoot Jamaat-e-Islami as mainstream. This is, at the very least, a contentious assertion, as was his support for the radical Egyptian scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi and the Bangladeshi Islamist Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, both of whom had condoned violence.\nMy decision to leak came in two stages. Towards the end of August I read an article in the Observer outlining fears about the future of the Festival of Muslim Cultures and difficulties it had encountered with the MCB and its sympathisers in Whitehall. A week later, I watched John Ware's Panorama documentary on the ideological origins of the MCB in south Asia, which further convinced me that Foreign Office policy was a dangerous aberration. I noted the lack of discussion within the FCO of the concerns raised by Ware. This had the unfortunate effect of strengthening the MCB's attacks on the programme.\nI called Martin Bright, author of the Observer article, and we met in the bar of a hotel next to the British Library, where I was continuing my research. I realised he had talked to several people who had voiced concerns about Mockbul Ali's role. We agreed to stay in touch. I went through documents that I had copied from Mockbul Ali's desk drawers earlier in the summer (for my own personal use - the new unit did not have a proper filing system) and delivered them to the Observer in a"}

We must liberate students and teachers from the chains of testing so the answer to the question, \"Why are we are learning this?\" doesn't have to be because it's on the test.\nStudents should be learning skills and content because it will be valuable in their lives now and later. They should understand very transparently the expectations and more importantly the reasons for learning what they are. As teachers, we need to design learning assessments that are formative in nature that provide students opportunities to grow their necessary real world skills.\nThis of course does NOT include bubbling in Scantron forms or answering multiple choice questions.\nRather than testing incessantly, why not consider alternatives that will actually give students a chance to show what they know in a meaningful way?\nProvide a reasonable amount of time, with a properly leveled task and let students creatively work on solving a problem, creating something new, applying their knowledge and skills in a way that demonstrates growth and progress.\nAnd here's the biggest part... let teachers be the ones creating the tasks not companies who think they understand education and learning but really just want to make money.\nThe most important goal of assessment must be to allow students opportunities to show what they know and the level of mastery they are currently performing at. Timed tests just don't do that adequately.\nIf all of the transcripts and testing and numbers and all of the data used to get students into college were accurate, how come so many students are dropping out in their first year?

Seeing my youngest daughter, who is now a senior at Mankato State majoring in Nursing, makes me proud.\nGraduating from high school and college is such a significant achievement. I felt so proud watching my sons and daughters walk across that stage and earn their diplomas. It was worth all the time spent helping with homework and all the early mornings and late nights of hard work to know that my children were on their way toward a successful future. No sacrifice seemed too large when made for my children.\nAs a state legislator, I do my best to make sure that all the children I serve here in Minnesota have the same chance for a good education. Why isn't Congress doing the same?\nOur current challenge with the Minnesota educational system is closing the achievement gap. Research tells us if we provide early learning opportunities, children are more likely to be successful in school and in life. Investing in universal pre-K for all 4-year-olds is a great start. In order to accomplish the goal of student achievement, we must get all children ready for kindergarten and work to ensure every student is reading by 3rd grade to achieve the desired outcomes we all know children deserve.\nIn addition to closing the achievement gap, the state should invest more in the St. Paul Promise Neighborhood, in the heart of St. Paul's historic Rondo and Frogtown neighborhoods. In this neighborhood, children and families experience high rates of poverty and racial and academic disparities. Highly mobile living situations and homelessness are also common.\nThe St. Paul Promise Neighborhood is a community-wide initiative to provide the academic and social supports children need to succeed in school and life, with a high emphasis on parental engagement. They provide wraparound services for children and their families, stable housing, access to social services, and priority for early childhood scholarships. Data shows that this program increases children's success. Shouldn't we fund programs like these with proven track records of success?\nAll sides and parties agree that a quality, solid education for the children in our families and communities is essential. Unfortunately, the federal budget does not reflect that priority. For more than a decade, the Pentagon has received more than half of the nation's discretionary budget. For the next fiscal year, more than $600 billion is slated for the Pentagon, nuclear weapons, and war. Education gets just $74 billion stretched out among Head Start, early childhood education, Pell grants, Title I programs, Stafford loans, school nutrition programs, and all the other components of our nation's critical education infrastructure.\nWe need to make sure that the nation our children will inherit is economically strong. We must invest appropriately to strategically address 21st century security threats, keep our nation safe, and ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have all the tools and equipment they need to safely do their job.\nNow, Congress is planning to increase the Pentagon's inappropriate reliance on the \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" -- a $90 billion war-spending slush fund that gives the Pentagon even more funding on top of its base budget and evades Congressionally-mandated budget caps put in place by a 2011 law.\nThe education programs that serve our nation's children are hurting for funding, yet the Pentagon gets an enormous slush fund.

The Afghan war going back to the late 1970s was covertly financed by the proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade.\nThe evidence suggests unequivocally that the multibillion dollar heroin trade out of Afghanistan is protected by the US led military alliance.\nSince the US led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the Golden Crescent opium trade has soared. According to the US media, this lucrative contraband is protected by Osama, the Taliban, not to mention, of course, the regional warlords, in defiance of the \u201cinternational community\u201d.\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), opium production in Afghanistan in 2003 is estimated at 3,600 tons, with an estimated area under cultivation of the order of 80,000 hectares.\nAn even larger bumper harvest is predicted for 2004.\nThe various reports and official statements are, of course, blended in with the usual \u201cbalanced\u201d self critique that \u201cthe international community is not doing enough\u201d, and that what we need is \u201ctransparency\u201d.\nThe headlines are \u201cDrugs, warlords and insecurity overshadow Afghanistan\u2019s path to democracy\u201d. In chorus, the US media is accusing the defunct \u201chard-line Islamic regime\u201d, without even acknowledging that the Taliban \u2013in collaboration with the United Nations\u2013 had imposed a successful ban on poppy cultivation in 2000. Opium production declined by more than 90 per cent in 2001. In fact the surge in opium cultivation production coincided with the onslaught of the US-led military operation and the downfall of the Taliban regime. From October through December 2001, farmers started to replant poppy on an extensive basis.\n\u201cTurning first to drug control, I had expected to concentrate my remarks on the implications of the Taliban\u2019s ban on opium poppy cultivation in areas under their control\u2026 We now have the results of our annual ground survey of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This year\u2019s production  is around 185 tons. This is down from the 3300 tons last year , a decrease of over 94 per cent. Compared to the record harvest of 4700 tons two years ago, the decrease is well over 97 per cent.\nIn fact, both Washington and the UNODC now claim that the objective of the Taliban in 2000 was not really \u201cdrug eradication\u201d but a devious scheme to trigger \u201can artificial shortfall in supply\u201d, which would drive up World prices of heroin.\nIn the wake of the 2001 US bombing of Afghanistan, the British government of Tony Blair was entrusted by the G-8 Group of leading industrial nations to carry out a drug eradication program, which would, in theory, allow Afghan farmers to switch out of poppy cultivation into alternative crops.

Those provisions will expire, or ''sunset,'' at the end of 2005 unless Congress re-authorizes them.\nBut Republicans in the Senate in recent days have discussed a proposal, written by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, that would repeal the sunset provisions and make the law's new powers permanent, officials said. Republicans may seek to move on the proposal this week by trying to attaching it to another antiterrorism bill that would make it easier for the government to use secret surveillance warrants against ''lone wolf'' terrorism suspects.\nMany Democrats have grown increasingly frustrated by what they see as a lack of information from the Justice Department on how its agents are using their newfound powers, and they say they need more time to determine whether agents are abusing those powers.\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said today that without extensive review, he ''would be very strongly opposed to any repeal'' of the 2005 time limit. He predicted that Republicans lacked the votes to repeal the limits.\nIndeed, Congressional officials and political observers said the debate might force lawmakers to take stock of how far they were willing to sacrifice civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism.\nJustice Department officials in interviews today credited the Patriot Act with allowing the F.B.I. to move with greater speed and flexibility to disrupt terrorist operations before they occur, and they say they wanted to see the 2005 time limit on the legislation lifted.\n''The Patriot Act has been an extremely useful tool, a demonstrated success, and we don't want that to expire on us,'' a senior department official said on condition of anonymity.\nAnother senior official who also demanded anonymity said the department had held discussions with Congressional Republicans about how that might best be accomplished. ''Our involvement has really been just keeping an open ear to the issue as it's proceeding, not to really guide the debate,'' the official said.\nWith the act's provisions not set to expire for more than two and a half years, officials expected that the debate over its future would be many months away. But political jockeying over separate bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, appears to have given Senator Hatch the chance to move on the issue much earlier than expected.\nThe Kyl-Schumer measure would eliminate the need for federal agents seeking secret surveillance warrants to show that a suspect is affiliated with a foreign power or agent, like a terrorist group.\nAdvocates say the measure would make it easier for agents to go after ''lone wolf'' terrorists who are not connected to a foreign group and might have allowed the F.B.I. to get a warrant against Zacarias Moussaoui, known"}

The money will largely be used to secure the nation's public and private information networks, although $36 million will support ongoing projects to improve surveillance technologies that detect advanced biological threats.\nThe DHS cybersecurity initiatives have been criticized for poor leadership and for being too reactionary. Earlier this month, Obama appointed Melissa Hathaway, who worked for the director of national intelligence in the Bush administration and was director of an multi-agency \"Cyber Task Force,\" to conduct a two-month review of DHS cybersecurity efforts. Hathaway is conducting her review as part of the White House's National Security Council, indicating authority over cybersecurity efforts may shift to other federal offices.\nEarlier this week, Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the National Security Agency should have more oversight of cybersecurity (PDF).\n\"The National Security Agency has the greatest repository of cybertalent,\" he said. \"I think that capability should be harnessed and built on as we're trying to protect more than just our intelligence networks or our military networks (and) as we expand to our federal networks and to our critical infrastructure networks.\"\nBlair acknowledged that there is a great deal of distrust of the NSA because of its warrantless wiretapping program and asked the committee for help in restoring the agency's reputation so it could take on initiatives that go beyond the scope of intelligence, such as cybersecurity.\nThe president's 2010 budget proposal also indicates the administration's intention to enhance the intelligence community's role in overseeing cybersecurity. Funding for the national intelligence program is not detailed, but that portion of the budget says the government \"will take an integrated and holistic approach to address current cybersecurity threats, anticipate future threats, and continue innovative public-private partnerships.

In a historic vote, the New York City Council passed the Community Safety Act to deter the NYPD from continuing this practice that has arbitrarily and continually violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Blacks and Latinos in New York City.\nThe two bills were spearheaded by Councilman Jumaane Williams and Councilman Brad Lander, both of Brooklyn. The legislation would institute an inspector general to oversee the actions of the NYPD, as is done in many law enforcement agencies across the country and would make it easier for citizens to launch lawsuits if they felt they were profiled.\nMayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly both criticized the legislation arguing that an inspector general was unnecessary and that the courts would become clogged with lawsuits. The mayor also suggested lawyers would reap mountains of money; unwittingly he was conceded that many of the cases would have merit.\nUpset by this repudiation of his Stop-and-Frisk police policy, the mayor took to the airwaves to complain on Friday.\nThis newspaper has published several of my columns, very critical of the disproportionate targeting of African Americans and Latinos through Stop-and-Frisk. Perhaps more than any other publication.\nTo say Friday wasn\u2019t the mayor\u2019s finest hour would be an understatement. If the mayor has any shred of respect for Blacks and Latinos, he would man up and take responsibility by apologizing posthaste as Reverend Al Sharpton has asked him to.\nIt was bad enough, last week, when Commissioner Kelly likening African Americans to Al-Qaeda terrorists. African Americans have been the most patriotic Americans -- many fell in overseas wars even while there was still official segregation in this country.\nWe must ask this of the mayor and commissioner: gentlemen have you no shame at all?\nHow in the world can this mayor say White people were stopped too much when they were stopped less than 10% of the time in over 700,000 in one recent year\u2014in a city where Whites are still the racial majority? The mayor\u2019s and his minions are now being duplicitous with the numbers by saying while Whites were only identified as murder suspects 7 percent of the time and yet were stopped 9 percent of time.\nThis is nothing more than a desperate disingenuous attempt to muddy the waters.

It would be great if we could get a hold of their notes or even recordings of the conversations.\nThe mayor can pretend if he wants that Stop-and-Frisk is a program aimed at identifying murder suspects.

Well, the rabbit hole goes deeper.\nAfter sniffing through files on the disc, a pesky hacker found out that the day-one DLC for Mass Effect 3 was already stored on the disc and that the \"From Ashes\" squad mate was completed along with the other characters already in the game before the game went gold.\nEscapist Magazine came across the news thanks to Crystal Prison Zone who had a file-investigator peek into the disc to scrounge, sift and pry away at the contents. On the base of it all, the file sizes, sound files and voice files are already stored on the disc and are complete, however due to their encryption it's difficult to tell how complete or incomplete they are. One thing is for sure, BioWare's Casey Hudson lied about the content not being ready to ship with the gold version of the disc, since it did.\nIn this case it's looking like the Mass Effect 3 situation is quite similar to the Capcom situation with Street Fighter X Tekken. However, we won't know for sure until the rest of the encrypted files are further pried open to see just how complete they are, but for the most part it's looking like the file structure of the \"From Ashes\" DLC was as complete as the rest of the files on the game's disc, which you can view over at the Crystal Zone (Warning: spoilers are given away on the website due to the files being exposed).\n\"Building good DLC is really hard, and developers are constantly trying to find a way to develop that DLC better, get it out to players, and to reach players\" .... \"There's no point in releasing DLC a year after your game comes out when most people have already sold it back to Gamestop three times. So, that means getting it out early. That means day one DLC.\"\nWell, Rockstar actually did release DLC well after the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, a year after the game was already on store shelves. A better argument would be, if you make the game complete enough you won't have to worry about gamers trading it in at GameStop three or more times within a six month period. That tells you a lot about the quality of the game, no?\nAdded to this, Bethesda usually waits three to six months before any DLC appears for their games and it's usually greeted with a well-welcomed response from a community of gamers who haven't traded in their copy. Again, it's telling if gamers still own a title six months to a year after its release and still support it by purchasing extra DLC. It's not the consumer's fault that a $60 purchase has a week long shelf-life before being traded in or dumped.\n\"Game developers are not evil... we just want to release awesome stuff. So players, please give us a chance, judge our games based on what they are, judge the DLC based on what it is, and stop thinking you're a producer and telling us when and where we should be building our content.\"\nWell Tim Schafer doesn't mind you telling him where or how content should be, but then again gamers don't care about giving Double Fine Productions input after giving them $2 million"}

Last year the software was swamped as well; in 2017, some students had their personal data exposed.\nThe state Education Department will review its contract with Questar to see whether it can levy any financial punishment for \"its failure to fulfill its contract to deliver reliable and seamless computer-based assessments in New York state.\" That includes considering canceling the contract, Elia said.\nAdditional paper tests also will be distributed to schools that prefer to switch to those.\nSchools have until April 12 to finish the two-day English language arts exams.

Two full moons won't rise in a single month again until July 2015.\nBut don't expect tonight's full moon to actually appear blue, unless you're peering through a thick haze of volcanic ash or forest fire smoke. \"Blue moon\" is not a reference to the satellite's observed color.\nThis somewhat obscure and complicated definition, in fact, is found in the 1937 edition of the \"Maine Farmers' Almanac.\" But in 1946, a writer for \"Sky and Telescope\" magazine misinterpreted it, declaring a blue moon to be the second full moon in a month with two of them.\nWidespread adoption of the new (and incorrect) definition apparently began in 1980, after the popular radio program \"StarDate\" used it during a show.\nBlue moons occur because lunar months are not synched up perfectly with our calendar months. It takes the moon 29.5 days to orbit Earth, during which time we see the satellite go through all of its phases. But every calendar month (except February) has 30 or 31 days, so two full moons occasionally get squeezed into a single month.\nThough the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" suggests the phenomenon is exceedingly rare, that's not quite the case. On average, blue moons come around once every 2.7 years, making them more common than the Summer Olympics, or a presidential election in the United States.\nSome years even boast two blue moons. This last happened in 1999, and it will occur again in 2018.\nTonight's blue moon also happens to fall on the day of late astronaut Neil Armstrong's memorial service. Armstrong, who on July 20, 1969 became the first person to set foot on the moon, died Aug. 25 following complications from heart surgery.\nSo stargazers may want to keep Armstrong's \"one small step\" in mind as they gaze up tonight.\n\"For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request,\" Armstrong's family wrote in a statement shortly after his death. \"Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\"\nIf you snap any good photos of Friday's full moon and would like them to be considered for a future story or gallery, please send them to SPACE.com assistant managing editor Clara Moskowitz at cmoskowitz@space.com, or managing editor Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com.\nFollow SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter@michaeldwall or SPACE.com@Spacedotcom.

Resident Evil, Grim Fandango, Homeworld\u2014it's only February and already three of the most notorious games in history have shown up in my Steam library, spruced up and ready for prom.\nHomeworld Remastered is of course the latest of the bunch, with Gearbox resurrecting Relic's 1999 space real-time strategy game for another go-round. Once again we pitch the most important question: Does the experience hold up?\nSurprisingly, Homeworld holds up better than pretty much any HD remake I've played, including the aforementioned Resident Evil and Grim Fandango but also genre kings like Halo and God of War. And it does so for one very important reason: There's still not a lot like it.\nIt's been fifteen years since Homeworld's original release. Fifteen years since the advent of the fully-3D real-time strategy game. Look around. How many of those do you see?\nThere are the occasional lookalikes. In fact, Paradox and CreativeForge attempted a Homeworld-alike just this past year with Ancient Space. Even so, no pretender to the crown has ever dethroned Homeworld, in part because the real-time strategy genre sort of...stopped being a thing. Oh, we still have the occasional title like StarCraft or Planetary Annihilation, but by-and-large the RTS landscape looks a lot more bleak in 2015 than it did in 1999. And as for fully-3D movement in an RTS? Forget it. Nobody's messing with that. Even Ancient Space settled for 2D-pretending-like-it's-3D.\nThe point is if you've never played Homeworld, doing so now feels about as revolutionary as it did in 1999. It's a space RTS that actually takes advantage of the fact that space is, well, space. You know that Wrath of Khan, \"His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking,\" eureka moment? It's a game built around that. It's a game where your ships move in three dimensions, and that matters.\nThe story is standard space-opera fare: The Kushan survived on the desert planet of Kharak for thousands of years until a chance find in the desert alerted them to the possibility of galactic space travel. They spend a hundred years working on the Mothership, meant to colonize a distant planet known as Hiigara or \"Home.\"\nThe ship takes off only to find aliens lying in wait. The Mothership and its fleet fight off the aliens and return to Kharak to discover the planet's been destroyed. With no options left, the Mothership sets out across the galaxy as the last bastion of Kushan life.\nHey, it's basically Battlestar Galactica: The Video Game. The comparison is even more apt because there's an element of persistence. At the end of each level your surviving ships and retained resources are carried over to the next mission. You are literally holding together the remnants of Kushan society as you travel home.\nSo let's talk about the quality of Gearbox's remaster.\nSome of the work done here is stunning. Gearbox has been kind enough to include the original Homeworld and Homeworld 2 alongside the Remastered editions, so you can boot up the old games if you'd like.\nAnd the"}

The area outlined by the heavy black lines is the current footprint of the oldest buildings in the complex. The plan calls for their demolition, however the schools staff is revisiting that matter.\nMount Vernon \u0097 The planned renovation of Woodlawn Elementary School has become a topic of discussion between Fairfax County Public Schools staff members and local elected officials. At the heart of the discussion is the school system\u2019s proposed renovations to the school. Those plans call for demolition of the original school structure, which opened in 1938 in the Engleside neighborhood near Route 1. That facet of the plan may change soon.\nThe demolition plans caught the attention of Lee District Supervisor Jeff McKay and state Del. Scott Surovell. McKay, who attended the school as a child, has since proposed a compromise that would preserve two of the original classrooms and the old front entrance as a separate structure. \u201cThis would preserve a part of our community\u2019s history, but still allow the planned renovation to continue on schedule,\u201d McKay said on Monday.\nThe current facility is an amalgam of structures built during the past 75 years. Classrooms date from 1938, 1947, 1952, 1956, 1968 and 1987. They are stitched together with hallways, all crowded with students and staff. A visitor can see the changes in materials and design by walking from one end to the other, much like an archeologist looking back through the layers of an old city.\nIN MARCH, school administrators and facilities managers were pursuing approved plans to renovate the school, which had scored poorly in a 2008 facility assessment survey. Those plans called for the razing of the 1938 and 1947 structures and building structures. As of that time, according to FCPS spokesman John Torre, the plans had been submitted for permit approval, but funding had yet to be secured.\nAn important matter, which may have complicated the coordination issues that McKay mentioned, is that the Woodlawn facility is in the Mount Vernon district, but many of the students live in Lee district.\nTyler said that her decision to ask for alternative plans arose from a meeting that she had on April 8. She discussed the original designs with FCPS facilities manager Jeff Plantenberg, school board members Dan Storck (Mount Vernon) and Tammy Derenak Kaufax (Lee). Platenberg left that session with a request to revisit the demolition plans.\nMcKay said that he was unaware of Tyler\u2019s initiative when he scheduled a separate meeting on April 16. Storck and Kaufax could not attend, but McKay, Surovell, Platenberg and Fairfax County History Commission chair Gretchen Bulova discussed possible options. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that we could reach a happy solution among us,\u201d McKay said of the group\u2019s recommended compromise.\nWoodlawn School enjoys a rich history. The Quakers who bought Woodlawn Plantation in 1846 started a school the following year in the miller\u2019s cottage at George Washington\u2019s gristmill. Later, after the Friends built their meeting house in 1851, the students met there. Courtland Lukens, owner of Engleside Farm, and E. E.

She was plagued by rashes, hives, muscle aches and assorted other miseries. But she never thought about food allergies. When her doctor wanted to test for them, \"I said I didn't have any.\"\nGollin isn't alone. According to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, about 12 million Americans have food allergies, but it's hard to be sure. You may think you're suffering from fatigue, the flu or some other low-level crud. That's what Gollin, a freelance editor in Miami, thought until her blood test indicated she's allergic to eggs, wheat, dairy, oranges and mint.\n\"The mint came out of the woodwork,\" said Gollin, 41, but eggs, wheat and dairy are among the eight most common culprits, accounting for 90 percent of food allergy reactions. The other offenders include tree nuts (cashews, pecans, etc.), soy and shellfish.\nSeafood and peanuts seem to trigger the most severe food allergies \u2014 those causing anaphylaxis, a sometimes fatal allergic response. Each year, food allergies account for 30,000 emergency room visits and up to 200 deaths, and the numbers are rising.\nAccording to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), the incidence of food allergies has doubled in the past 10 years. South Miami pediatrician Dr. Kathryn Eisermann-Rogers sees it every day. In the 20 years of her practice, the rise in food allergies has been \"exponential. Especially peanuts. It's three times what it was 10 years ago,\" she said.\nWhy the spike? And why, all of a sudden, peanuts?\n\"We really don't understand the whys,\" said FAAN's Deb Scherrer.\nWhat is known is true food allergies, unlike food intolerances or sensitivities, are triggered by your body's immune system flipping out when a food \u2014 harmless to most \u2014 crosses its path. Eating a sandwich may cause someone with a true wheat allergy to risk immediate anaphylaxis \u2014 breaking out in hives, having trouble swallowing and in some extreme cases, dying. Someone with wheat-sensitivity may feel itchy or have gastric misery after eating the sandwich bread.\nWhether Gollin's reaction to mint is a true food allergy or food sensitivity, the result is the same \u2014 \"horrible stomach aches.\"\nFor Robin Grayson Cohen, a licensed Oriental medicine practitioner, the difference between a food allergy and food sensitivity \"is the degree of reaction.\" Grayson Cohen has seen clients whose symptoms include everything from mild body aches to life-threatening anaphylaxis. That's what makes food allergies so diabolical. \"From skin rash to headaches, to bloating, to fatigue, it looks differently in everybody,\" she said.\nWith environmental allergies such as dust, treatment usually involves a series of injections introducing low levels of the substance into the body, encouraging resistance.

{"idx": "9429", "prompt": "Continue the following text: On Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio pushed \ufffdthe reset button\ufffd in its controversial rate case involving American Electric Power. Todd Snitchler, the commission chairman, explained that starting over would \ufffdensure that we have a complete picture of any proposal, and balance the interests of all customers and the utility.\ufffd He stressed that Ohio would continue moving toward a competitive marketplace for electricity.\nAgain, his words and those of other commissioners sounded reassuring. Then, there is the reality of what the commission does.\nIn December, the panel approved a rate plan for AEP that soon proved a colossal embarrassment. Many customers opened their January bills to discover stunning increases, some exceeding 40 percent. The burden fell mostly on small businesses, local governments, school districts and nonprofit organizations. They felt blindsided. They immediately howled.\nWorth tracking is the evolving response of the commission as the outrage gained momentum, leading to the reversal last week. The response suggests the commission has yet to face squarely its decision-making. It indicates how far the panel must travel to regain lost credibility.\nInitially, the commission argued that the soaring bills reflected costs long deferred and now delivered to customers. Yet, as the Dispatch discovered in its reporting, the much larger factor was cost-shifting, from large businesses to smaller ones, the product of behind-the-scenes negotiations, in which the eventual victims had little, if any, voice.\nThe commission also insisted that the increases reflected a transition to the marketplace. The flaw in this explanation is that electricity prices have been declining in the market.\nConsider that the commission recently conducted a rate case involving Duke Energy that resulted in a market-triggered reduction of 17 percent for customers. FirstEnergy long has followed this course, the market driving down its prices, too.\nPerhaps most telling, AEP has participated in competitive bidding in FirstEnergy\ufffds service territory, even winning at prices substantially below those it charges in its own area.\nNext, Chairman Snitchler blamed AEP. He noted that \ufffdour decisions are only as good as the company billing information they are based upon.\ufffd In other words, the utility wasn\ufffdt forthcoming, and \ufffdnow that we have a full understanding,\ufffd commission members will develop a better plan.\nThe truth is, the PUCO did have adequate information. The Columbus Dispatch obtained commission email messages that show the staff member in charge of the AEP case sharing his concern about the rate plan. He predicted precisely the coming events, the huge price increases, the blowback, the red faces for commissioners.\nWorth stressing is the crucial role of the Dispatch and its request for public records. The utility and the commission resisted. When the newspaper finally got its hands on the documents, it revealed more than thinking inside the commission. It delivered an analysis that confirmed the doubts about the rate plan.\nIn a matter of days, the commission gave AEP its approval. The chairman and his colleagues missed the reporting? Actually, Snitchler responded in a letter to the editor, arguing the potential problems had been addressed.\nHe had a full understanding or not?\nOf late, Snitchler has emphasized the limits of the record on which the commission must base its decision. Uh-oh. Is he slipping close to sounding like one of those bureaucrats his boss, Gov. John Kasich, so detests?\nClearly, AEP desires a cushion in moving to a competitive market. Many customers haven\ufffdt seen \ufffdthe upfront benefit.\ufffd The utility bids elsewhere, but in a key element of the plan, other utilities are barred from competing in A"}

Howard Dean and retired Gen. Wesley Clark are reaching out to potential voters over the Internet, tapping pockets of support both in and outside of the usual Democratic activist blocs, and using online buzz to raise money and generate on-the-ground organization.\nGeneral Clark is also challenging conventional wisdom when it comes to the length of the campaign, having only joined the race last month, yet vaulting to the top of national polls.\nAt the same time, the heavily front-loaded primary calendar - with an unusually crowded and competitive field - has pushed many campaigns to target their resources in new ways, trying to break out of the herd by focusing attention on places such as South Carolina and Arizona instead of Iowa and New Hampshire. Clark and Sen. Joseph Lieberman are skipping the Iowa caucuses altogether, while even those candidates competing in Iowa are looking ahead to other states.\nThe overall effect may be a broadening and diversification of the primary process. With seven states holding primaries just one week after New Hampshire - including Southern and Western states with significant minority populations - the pool of voters selecting the nominee will be far larger and more representative of the overall Democratic Party. As a result, candidates like Clark may be able to run more overtly national campaigns - and may have more options when it comes to assembling a winning coalition, rather than having to fight over the same set of voters.\n\"We are sliding toward a national primary, there's no question about it,\" says Emmett Buell, an expert on the primary system at Denison University. \"In terms of what the process was two election cycles ago, Clark's strategy makes no sense at all. But if in fact what he's doing is gunning for the big event, a Titanic Tuesday, then there's a certain rationale to it.\"\nIn many ways, experts say, the importance of the roles played by Iowa and New Hampshire has increasingly diminished, as the primary calendar has grown more compressed and the process has gradually become more nationalized. Almost no candidates have managed to win both early contests in recent cycles - and in many cases, the eventual nominee has been able to come back from seemingly devastating losses in one state or the other. In the 2000 cycle, for example, George W. Bush lost New Hampshire to Sen. John McCain by 19 points, but was able to come back and beat him shortly after in South Carolina.\nIndeed, \"on the Republican side since 1980, the South Carolina primary has been a corrective for anomalous outcomes in New Hampshire,\" says Professor Buell.\nSince Democrats will now compete in South Carolina just one week after New Hampshire, the state could take on a similar role for them. And while the Republican primary electorate in South Carolina is not necessarily all that different from the electorates in New Hampshire and Iowa, the Democratic pools are far more varied among those states - with South Carolina consisting of a substantial percentage of African-Americans. Likewise, some of the other states holding primaries alongside South Carolina - such as Arizona and New Mexico - have high numbers of Hispanic voters.\nOf course, the momentum generated from a surprising performance in Iowa or New Hampshire may still"}

The childless Maggie can only watch helplessly as her husband continues to sink into the bottle over the suicide of his long-time friend and football co-star, Skipper.\nSister Woman Mae, portrayed by Sarah Gantzer, is an extremely competent and cunning foil to Maggie. She's ambitious, blond, beautiful and married to Brick's big brother Gooper (Jared Gantzer), an extremely successful corporation lawyer.

{"idx": "9449", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Opinion: Confirming you haven't pirated your software is part of the Windows landscape now. Like many landscape features, you won't notice it unless you go looking.\nWhen Windows Product Activation was announced for Windows XP, the predictions from some were dire. Surely, it was argued, this onerous burden and the certain failures of it to operate properly would finally inspire people to move from Windows.\nOf course it didnt turn out that way. Activation has been, at worst, a minor nuisance. Such will be the case with awkwardly named Genuine Microsoft Software program, an anti-piracy initiative that has been voluntary for some time but that, it now appears, will be made mandatory some time in the second half of 2005.\nThe descriptions on Microsofts Web page for this initiative focus on the good things that will come from using Genuine Windows, and from participating in the program, which for now is voluntary. A few of the advantages are tangible: Get a free copy of Photo Story 3 for Windows, for example. Many of the advantages given, however, are just marketing goo about having the richest and most reliable experience.\nThe real point of this program is to make you pay for Windows if you want to get all the things youre going to need, like security updates. In fact, the marketing-speak on the Genuine this and that page implies that it perhaps will be mandatory. After all, why would you need Genuine Windows for the fastest, most reliable access to updates, unless its required? Theres no point in such a program being voluntary except as a test period before its made mandatory.\nIn the new phase, when you want to download some Microsoft updates you will need to run an ActiveX control that confirms your copy of Windows XP is activated and legal. If its not activated, you are asked to do so (which you need to do, in any event, not long after you get your PC). If you dont have the key you need to do this, it may still be possible to satisfy the program with information about where you bought your PC and Windows. Microsoft has a demo in case you want to see exactly how this works.\nIf you have a legal and activated copy of Windows, the process is over before you know it, and you never have to go through it again on that computer. Its not clear to me what the program does on versions of Windows prior to Windows XP, or on copies of it that dont require activation, such as corporate site licenses, but I know it does run on Windows 2000.\nClearly, Microsoft has a heavy burden to make sure this process runs correctly as close to 100 percent of the time as possible. They seem to have done that with Product Activation and have biased Activation toward letting the user run the software as opposed to denying it. I am sure they will do the same in this case.\nBut if you have Internet Explorers security set to High or\u2014Heaven forbid!run Firefox or some other \"non-standard\" browser, you may have some problems. But youd have all the same problems with Windows Update, so you need to solve them anyway.\nWhenever I write about Microsofts anti-piracy efforts I get a few e-mails from users who tell me how easy it is to bypass and where to download the software and keys I need. Putting aside the fact that stealing is wrong\u2014a point that seems lost on many of these people\u2014there is no doubt in my mind that Microsoft would not institute a program like this unless they knew it would make a practical difference.\nThey always said Activation was about stopping \"casual"}

There are still waiting for Godot,\u201d he said referring to the seemingly endless review process involving the Chicago-based company.\nFor his part, Baquet described the atmosphere of Tribune during his tenure at the Los Angeles Times saying that the \u201cpanic brought on by Wall Street\u201d was the impetus for the cuts. \u201cMy biggest fear is the panic and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s justified.

While the editorial page was split from the newsroom during Baquet?s tenure, Baquet conceded: ?I understand what they were trying to do,? he said adding that the opinion section of the newspaper is the most threatened. ?I wouldn?t have done it because it invites conflict.?\nFor as many questions as Baquet fielded about the Los Angeles Times during the panel, he tried to distance himself from his former employer. ?[I?m trying] as much as possible to cut myself off from my old job.

Once counted on as Alex Ovechkin\u2019s wing man on the top line, Clark was forced to sit and watch his teammates morph into one of the league\u2019s elite attractions.\nWhen Clark was able to play, it was often in a reduced role or with limited effectiveness because he was trying to compete despite an injury. There were times the offense was lacking gritty play in front of the net and in the corners, and the elixir - a healthy Clark - wasn\u2019t available.\nNow Clark is operating at 100 percent, and the Caps have their captain back.\nJust what role Clark will be coming back to remains to be seen. Washington signed a player with comparable skills this offseason in Mike Knuble, and he is a lock to occupy the right wing on one of the top two lines.\nAlexander Semin also has played on the right side for much of Boudreau\u2019s tenure, but with Tomas Fleischmann out until at least mid-October, there could be an opening among the top six forwards.\nA full season of good health for Clark would make a deep offensive club even more dangerous. It also would be a boon for Washington in the leadership department. Having Sergei Fedorov around helped ease the loss of Clark\u2019s veteran presence in the dressing room, and now Clark essentially will do the same after the Russian center returned to his native country.\nAfter missing three months because of wrist surgery, Clark returned to the Caps\u2019 lineup for the final eight games of their postseason run. He matched his regular-season goal total with a tally in Game 4 of the second round against the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was exactly the type of goal the Caps were not scoring enough - both feet in the crease and multiple defenders harassing him."}

They were in favour of acceptance.\nBut a lot of work was done to shift public opinion.\nSome of this was done by right wingers, some by left wing defectors and some by figures who were held up as representing feminism.\nThey are all obsessed by visible signs of the Muslim religion, but it\u2019s particularly an obsession with Muslim women and girls\u2019 clothing.\nThey also regularly attack the Muslim religion in itself. The fact that Islam doesn\u2019t have a pope or an official hierarchy who they can address, like most Christian religions do, really bothers them.\nSo for years there has been talk of creating an \u201cIslam of France\u201d and now the government has set up a \u201cFoundation for Islam of France\u201d.\nThe man who is to lead it, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, has said things that verge on Islamophobic.\nChevenement also argues that there are two models, the \u201cFrench model\u201d of cultural assimilation and the \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d model of multiculturalism.\nSupposedly in Britain and the US different groups live side by side but are segregated, each with their own rules and laws.\nObviously this is completely wrong. Where there is separation, it\u2019s because Muslims are stigmatised, pushed away and excluded.\nIn a way, this Islamophobia is a continuation of French colonialism.

The programme was attended by a large number of people, who came to listen to the chief guest of the programme, who was none other than a strong crusader against corruption, Karnataka State Lokayukta Justice N Santosh Hegde. He was to address the members on the theme, \u201cCorporate Governance-HR Perspective\u201d.\nThe topic was introduced by a senior, respected HR professional, National NIPM past chairman D R Nagaraj. He mentioned about the corruption in the country and how it has made inroads into the HR profession too and was concerned about corruption in Recruitment and other areas, wherein few HR professionals are becoming part of the corruption network. He expressed his helplessness, but he was upset about the bad breath circulating around HR professionals. He concluded his speech by putting clear expectation. The members aptly heard the tall personality. Santosh Hegde throughout his speech touched upon the roots of corruption, why educated people are not voting, how governance in government departments is collapsing, how common people are suffering, his struggle to fight the corruption within the limited powers and so on.\nHis speech did not touch corporate governance and its link to the HR profession. Is it not the right time to look into some aspects of corruption happening through HR function?\nIn my last 30 years in the HR profession, this aspect was never discussed openly in HR Fora. Not all, but few HR professionals are bent on making quick bucks in whatever way it may be. In public sectors, the corruption starts in recruitment and it has spread its tentacles in confirmation of probationers, transfer, promotion, while engaging service providers, etc. In earlier days, the corruption in private sector was never heard in HR department particularly. Today, it is spread in all sectors.\nRecruitment is one of the main functions in HR. In Recruitment, corruption can take place in many ways. Candidates offer money and gifts to HR professionals and other selection committee members in both private and public sectors. Today, placement agencies are making huge money in recruitment business. The corruption starts at the enrolment of placement agencies in private sectors. It is easy for HR professionals to induct somebody of their choice and money is easily is exchanged.\nHR professionals are the decision makers for releasing recruitment advertisements in news papers. The advertisement agencies may offer commission for getting the orders for advertisements. Outsourcing has grown itself as an industry within the domain of recruitment. This is where, the large transaction happens regularly. Anyway, it is very difficult to catch the culprits red-handed.\nMany more transactions may be taking place in the dark and the question remains how to prevent them and to ward off their ill-effects which may befall an organisation. How does an employee who is victim to this vicious circle feel and what will be his opinion about such organisations? It is sure that the attitude, anger, disillusionment of the candidate will have a bearing on morale and productivity.\nEmployees who enter the organisation in such a way will always be trouble creators or will have rebellious approach. Will the HR professionals get respect?\nThis is one of the critical areas every organisation has to bring total control and adopt full proof system to hire service providers such as transportation, canteen, security, housekeeping, etc. Along"}

{"idx": "9467", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Research shows how this recession bucked historical patterns.\nIt seems intuitive: If people are worried about being laid off from their jobs, they are likely to work harder to keep those jobs. But until about 20 years ago, labor productivity actually went down during recessions. That was because companies were often hesitant to slash jobs as soon as sales started to fall. This \u201choarding\u201d of jobs, as economists call it, meant that the average output of each worker slipped.\nThe last three downturns have been different, and the brutal recession from 2007 through 2009 was almost a mirror image of the historical pattern. Productivity climbed 2.1% shortly before the economy tanked, but then accelerated sharply to 3.16% during the recession. Overall, the number of hours worked plunged far more than the nation\u2019s output of goods and services.\nIndeed, the ability of companies to get by with fewer workers has become a defining feature of the economy during much of the post-recession recovery. Even as corporate profits rebounded, employment climbed slowly and long-term unemployment remains elevated seven years after the recession officially ended.\nBut why did productivity actually go up? Did companies somehow manage to weed out the less industrious or less skilled employees? Or did the workers themselves step up their productivity?\nIn a new paper, \u201cMaking Do with Less: Working Harder During Recessions,\u201d Edward P. Lazear and Kathryn L. Shaw of Stanford Graduate School of Business teamed up with Christopher Stanton of Harvard University to answer the question empirically.\nThe researchers did so by studying the detailed performance statistics of 23,000 real workers at a major corporation with operations across the United States.\nTheir conclusion: It was the workers, especially those most in fear of being laid off, who were primarily responsible for boosting productivity when times got hard.\nThe researchers don\u2019t name the company or the industry, citing confidentiality obligations. They describe it as a \u201ctechnology-based services\u201d firm in which thousands of workers have essentially identical tasks. Employees also have their performance monitored by computer. Think here of jobs at customer call centers, insurance claims processors, airline check-in counters and retail stores.\nThe most tell-tale evidence of the impact of job insecurity, however, was that productivity climbed faster among employees in states with very steep spikes in unemployment.\nBecause computers kept detailed records of each employee\u2019s work, and because people had similar tasks to perform, the researchers were able to compare productivity before, during, and right after the recession of 2007 to 2009. They were also able to compare differences between states with very high spikes in unemployment and states with more modest slowdowns. They could even compare what happened to \u201cstars\u201d and \u201claggards\u201d \u2014 people who had been above-average or below-average performers before the recession.\nAcross the company, productivity per hour climbed 5.4% between June 2006 and May 2010. Among employees who held the same jobs throughout the four-year period, productivity climbed 4.8%.\nThe most tell-tale evidence of the impact of job insecurity, however, was that productivity climbed faster among employees in states with very steep spikes in unemployment, such as Florida, than among employees in states with more modest downturns.\nIt turns out, however, that \u201cstar\u201d performers responded quite differently from \u201claggards.\u201d Shaw and her colleagues found that productivity changed very little among the stars, perhaps because they were already performing at their peak or because they"}

{"idx": "9470", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For anyone tethered to a lawnmower, the Holy Grail of horticultural accomplishment would be grass that never grows but is always green.\nNow, that vision of suburban bliss seems plausible; scientists have mapped a critical hormone signaling pathway that regulates the stature of plants. In addition to lawns that rarely require mowing, the finding could also enable the development of sturdier, more fruitful crop plants such as rice, wheat, soybeans, and corn.\nIn a paper published in the journal Nature, Howard Hughes Medical Institute scientists report they have deciphered the signaling pathway for a key class of steroid hormones that regulates growth and development in plants.\n\"By manipulating the steroid pathwaywe think we can regulate plant stature and yield,\" said Joanne Chory, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and the senior author of the new report.\nManipulation of plant stature has been a longstanding goal in horticulture, agronomy, and forestry. The ability to control plant size precisely would have broad implications for everything from urban forestry to crop and garden plant development.\nBeyond perpetually short grass, trees could be made more compact for better growth in crowded cities, and berry bushes could be made taller for ease of harvesting.\nTo chart the pathway, Chory and colleague Grgory Vert of the Salk Institute's Plant Biology Laboratory examined the molecular influence of a family of plant hormones known as brassinosteroids. Scientists have found brassinosteroids in all plants where they have looked for them.\nAs critical chemical messengers of plant development, they are found in low levels in virtually all plant cells, including seeds, flowers, roots, leaves, stems, pollen, and young vegetative tissue.\n\"Without them, plants are tiny dwarves, with reduced vasculature and roots, and are infertile,\" Chory explained. \"They also regulate senescence or aging. Since brassinosteroids mainly regulate cell expansion, though, they are one of the most important hormones that regulate stature.\"\nKnowing the molecular chain of command -- how the hormone acts to influence genetic events that govern development at the cellular level -- gives scientists a way to reshape the steroid pathway to develop plants that grow in specified ways.\n\"We might be able to dwarf grass and keep it green by limiting brassinosteroids or increase the yield of rice by having more brassinosteroids in seeds,\" Chory said. Another recent study by Makoto Matsuoka's group in Japan, she said, showed that limiting brassinosteroids in rice affected leaf angle and improved yield in densely planted fields."}

That\u2019s because every autumn, BDC organizes Small Business Week and that gives me a chance to do one of my favourite things: meet with entrepreneurs and talk about how they overcome the challenges they face.\nIn my more than 30 years as a chief executive, mostly in the private sector, I can honestly say that running a business is more difficult today than it has ever been. Entrepreneurs are confronted by an unforgiving landscape of rapid technological change, fierce, often global, competition and persistent economic turbulence.\nAs part of my job, I regularly meet with ambitious entrepreneurs who have the qualities necessary to succeed in these challenging times \u2014 determination, the right mix of strategic and operational skills and resilience in the face of setbacks. Their companies are world-class, thanks to a relentless commitment to innovation, productivity improvements and finding new markets both here and abroad. The problem is we simply need more of them.\nAmbitious entrepreneurs rarely seek out the spotlight perhaps because they\u2019re so busy making it happen. But we need to pay more attention to them, both to better support them and to learn from them.\nThe need for drive and ingenuity in our entrepreneurs has never been greater. Our traditional markets in the United States and Europe are suffering through a protracted period of slow growth amid political and fiscal difficulties. While there is opportunity in countries such as China, India and Brazil, these are among the most challenging markets in which to do business.\nUnfortunately, the reality is that Canadian businesses as a group are not performing as well as they need to, given the tough conditions that define the global marketplace. For example, they are not as productive as their U.S. peers, mainly because their performance is weak when it comes to business innovation.\nLet\u2019s be clear about the stakes for our standard of living. Small and medium-sized businesses are the engine of the Canadian economy. They account for 64% of private sector employment, including the lion\u2019s share of new job creation. If they can compete better and grow, they can sustain the nation\u2019s prosperity better.\nTo a remarkable degree, Canada is a country of small businesses. Fully, 55% of all businesses have four or fewer employees while 98% have fewer than 100 employees (Statistics Canada\u2019s definition of small). But the smalls aren\u2019t growing into mediums. There are fewer enterprises with 100 to 500 employees (the definition of medium-sized) than there was a decade ago.\nVery small businesses simply don\u2019t have the scale to make productivity boosting investments such as adopting sophisticated information and communications technology or purchasing expensive new equipment and machinery. Size and growth does matter.\nIt adds up to a tall order for entrepreneurs who are trying to juggle limited resources. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that ambitious business owners receive co-ordinated support from governments, senior members of the business community, financial institutions, advisors and mentors. Canada\u2019s successful Own the Podium initiative in support of our Olympic athletes comes to mind as a model.\nOne promising example of a private-sector endeavour is the Quebec Global 100 Network. Here, the chief executives of 20 leading corporations have volunteered to share their knowledge, advice and experience at the global level with a select group of up to 80 ambitious chiefs of successful mid-size Quebec companies. The goal is to help these companies become more internationally competitive. We need more initiatives of this kind across Canada so our best entrepreneurs receive the mentoring, coaching and resources they need to reach their potential."}

But whatever the construction series creator and writer Jason Mosberg was going for here remains not only vague but annoyingly suspect, as if the concept of the dollar floating around town and into various characters' hands was enough to keep viewers interested in a large, ambling mystery without a ton of forward momentum.\nIn fact, if you knew nothing of the concept before watching One Dollar, the drama at the center doesn't seem even remotely interesting enough in that first episode to set the hook. Set in an aging Rust Belt city of dubious origin where the steel industry is fading and people in town are barely holding on \u2014 well, the blue-collar ones and the poorer folk are, while the upper crust is merely busying itself with parties and philandering \u2014 One Dollar first introduces us to Garrett (Philip Ettinger). Part loner, part dimwit, Garrett is saddled with a 2-year-old daughter and has almost no means to pay the town's flinty child care provider to take care of her while he works at the plant (the daughter's mother has abandoned Garrett apparently \u2014 One Dollar believes that the less you know the more eager you'll be to find out, which is a dubious proposition in most dramas). While the show flits between a couple of other brewing subplots in the pilot, our attention is supposed to be on Garrett and, by extension, how down and out the town is.\nSome uptown housewives bump into Garrett when they've crossed the proverbial railroad tracks in search of something you can only get where the poor folk live and one of them thinks Garrett is homeless, so she puts a dollar bill in his empty coffee cup.\nAnd so it begins. What \"it\" will be exactly looks to be a gimmick that plays out over the whole season, but the camera always comes back to see the dollar that Garrett carries around and then, in the closing minutes, hands to another person in a transaction. The person who gets that dollar (in this instance, singer-songwriter Sturgill Simpson, making his acting debut and almost immediately becoming the most interesting thing about the series) then has their story, or at least part of it, told in the episode. At the end of the second episode, Simpson's character, named Ken Fry but called \"Walmart,\" passes the dollar bill to Carol (Deirdre O'Connell), a local school teacher, and the third episode mostly follows her while keeping up with its other spinning plates.\nYou get the conceit here. Except \u2014 and this might prove either annoying or more intriguing, depending on your demeanor \u2014 Carol doesn't appear to pass the dollar to anyone and"}

In the years since, we have spent thousands of weekends in bookstores. My older son\u2019s first outing was to a Borders in Columbus; my younger son\u2019s first outing was to a Barnes & Noble in Pittsburgh.\nInevitably, I have a lot of books. When I was fresh out of college, I could somehow manage to read three or four books each week without it interfering in the rest of my life. As the years passed, I don\u2019t read as fast and I\u2019m often distracted and life is more chaotic. Now I read three or four books each month and browse the rest. Eventually I learned to buy fewer books, but in the meantime I accumulated many books that I fully intended to read but never did.\nUnread books accumulate. The problem with books that we intend to read sometime is that they are far harder to part with than the ones we have already read.\nIsn\u2019t that the truth? The problem is that you buy a book about something you want to learn. You don\u2019t read it. Five years later you\u2019ve bought all the best books about that topic and read none of them (tell me I\u2019m not the only person who does this!). Now you can\u2019t simply pick one up at random and read it. You have enough books here to earn a degree in the topic. You feel like you need to design a curriculum and study the books in a logical sequence. You don\u2019t have the time or energy to do that right now, so it stays on your list of someday.\nHinduism teaches that the way to success is to focus on a goal so that it\u2019s the only thing you see and to aim your intention like an arrow. Some of the biggest heroes in the epics, like Rama and Arjun, are archers, and their ability to hit their targets is used metaphorically to teach us the proper way of taking action. It\u2019s no coincidence that Rama is an avatar of Vishnu, whose shakti is Lakshmi, or that one of Arjun\u2019s names is Dhananjaya, which means to win wealth.\nIf the way to success is complete focus of our attention on our goals, then what does that mean about all these things we intend to learn or do \u201csomeday\u201d?\nOne of the reasons Ganesh and Lakshmi are so often worshiped together is that Ganesh removes the obstacles and Lakshmi helps us reach our target (laksh actually means a goal or target). We won\u2019t make much progress toward our goals if we\u2019re weighed down with hundreds of pounds of random things we might want to do someday. If I packed all my unread books into a giant backpack, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to walk.\nImagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love.

She covets Chanel clothing and Louis Vuitton bags, dreams of owning a BMW or Mercedes-Benz someday, and struggles to think of an American brand that appeals to her.\n\"There are more choices for European brands, more styles, so they are more interesting,\" she said.\nWhen President Bush arrives in Beijing on Saturday, he is expected to press China to reduce its large and growing trade surplus with the United States, on track to hit a record $200 billion this year.\nBut for a long list of reasons, American products are struggling these days in the Chinese market, where they have trouble measuring up to European brands and even some Chinese brands.\nThe United States is buying $6 worth of goods from China for every $1 worth of goods it ships to China. With American imports from China climbing at a clip of nearly 30 percent a year, American exports to China would have to nearly triple each year just to keep the deficit from widening further.\nMany economists say that it is the United States' total trade deficit that is a more disturbing reflection of overall American weakness in trade. But it is the bilateral deficit between China and America that sets off fires on both sides.\nChina's economy is galloping along just as a long series of America's weaknesses are combining to hurt American exports. With many of America's name brands made in China these days, from clothing to cars, the Chinese are beginning to wonder what a \"Made in U.S.A.\" label really has to offer.\n\"The only U.S.-produced items that I can think of that exist in large quantities in China are dollar bills,\" said Matthew Crabbe, the managing director of Access Asia Ltd., a market research firm.\nBut the handful of products that Americans make well, and which sell like hotcakes, do not have labels on the sleeves -- Boeing's aircraft and General Electric's power plant equipment, railway locomotive parts and aircraft engines. Beyond those, American exports to China consistently grow more slowly than imports, and this year, they have slowed even more.\nTo be sure, many economists question the value of focusing on any single bilateral trade deficit -- even one that Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, decried in a speech in Beijing on Monday as \"the largest trade deficit in the history of the world.\"\nChinese officials increasingly try to deflect criticism by emphasizing America's growing dependence on borrowing from the world. That borrowing pays for a higher level of consumption than America's economic output would otherwise sustain.\n\"Even if the United States stopped importing from China, it would have to buy from somewhere else,\" said Liao Xiaoqi, China's vice minister of commerce.\nAnother big reason for the expanding bilateral deficit lies in changing patterns of trade. Companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia increasingly manufacture only the most technologically sophisticated components at home. They ship them to China, buy the less complicated parts locally at low cost and assemble the product in China for shipment directly to Europe or the United States.\nA result is that East Asia has achieved the dream that a dozen years ago gave rise to the North American Free Trade Agreement: a regional manufacturing center that taps each country for the part it can produce most efficiently"}

The extended-stay hotel features amenities include fully equipped kitchens and work areas in each room, business and fitness centers, laundry facilities and courtesy on-post shuttle services.\nThis is the second mid-sized hotel in the U.S. constructed of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) - a sustainable building product made up of several layers of lumber board stacked in alternating directions and pressed to maximize strength and durability.\n\"The resilient building that you are standing in was constructed from more than 1,700 pieces of sustainable engineered mass timber panels,\" said Johnston. \"And all of the wood in the building is SFC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified, meaning that the product came from responsibly managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits to the communities where the wood was harvested.\"\nCLT was used in the hotel's floors, roof, exterior and select interior walls. Kollin Rommel, Lendlease development manager, said that four months were removed from the scheduled construction plan because of the Lendlease design model.\n\"In addition to the long-term sustainability benefits, the use of CLT along with other integrated construction techniques has made it possible to do more with less - to build greater efficiencies than conventional materials and methods,\" said Rommel. \"This hotel was completed with less materials, less labor and required less time.\"\nThe hotel was assembled by a 13-person crew, composed mostly of local military veterans who were referred by the Army Soldier for Life program, Johnston said.\nFraming operations began in October 2017 and were completed in March.

Authorities were initially notified about Pitts in 2017, when he lived in Cincinnati and allegedly made statements supporting Al Qaeda and advocating violence against U.S. military members.\n\"This case illustrated that law enforcement can not sit back and wait for Mr. Pitts to commit a violent act,\" Anthony said.\nAuthorities said Pitts made Facebook posts with \"disturbing\" messages, saying \"We as Muslims need to start training like this every day. We need to know how to shoot guns, throw grenades, hand to hand combat,\" Anthony said during a news conference.\nAfter moving to Cleveland, authorities said Pitts continued to express his \"radical ideology.\" During a meeting last week with an undercover FBI agent, Anthony said Pitts noted \"their holiday is coming up.\"\n\"What would hit them at their core? Blow up in the, have a bomb blow up in the 4th of July parade,\" he said.\nIn the last week, Pitts then went downtown to conduct reconnaissance at Voinovich Bicentennial Park and the Coast Guard station, among other locations, according to officials. He also continued to voice hatred for the military, saying he wanted to \"chop off heads and hands.\"\n\"He wanted to target people watching fireworks and watching the Fourth of July parade downtown,\" he told reporters.\nBesides the alleged plan to attack on July 4, officials said Pitts wanted to also harm military members and families of service members. Herdman said Pitts discussed giving remote control cars packed with shrapnel to children of military members. When he was asked by the undercover FBI agent if he was worried about injuring children, Pitts said, \"I don\u2019t care and I have no regrets,\" according to Herdman.\nIn recent weeks, Pitts also talked about wanting to travel to Philadelphia, and told the undercover agent Sunday he wanted to conduct reconnaissance for a future attack using a truck packed with explosives, similar to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, authorities said in the criminal complaint.\nAnthony said the arrest came after multiple conversations showed that Pitts had a desire to do harm. Pitts was born and \"radicalized\" in the U.S., and wanted to commit violence in the name of Al Qaeda, he added.

I don't remember any of the dances I saw then but I remember how I felt, and that is the power of the art of dance. It shifts and manipulates both the physical space we see and the space of imagination we experience in our own mind. Last night's performance continued the exceptional artistry of molding and expanding our experience of reality.\nFirst, I want to say that every dancer on the stage last night possessed a passion and an excellence that allowed them not to merely dance choreography but to live it and live through it which gave the audience a more deeply textured and emotionally layered dance experience. I am going to mostly concentrate my somewhat esoteric thoughts here on the actual craft and artistry of creating the dances. The evening opened with an excerpt from Norwood Pennewell's 2015 dance 'So You See'. A dancer leaps into the light shaping and reshaping the space, while intricately interplaying with the rhythmic motion in the music. The turns and balances and leaps enliven the positive space. But it's the transformation of the negative space through movement that move us from step to step, that captivate us and keep us pulled into a new world of expressing. Pennewell, unapologetically and with abandon take us there deeper than the surface to craft an authentic work.\n'Here' Guy Thorne brought imagination to life. The vivid solid colors of the costumes gave a metaphoric hint to the strings of the violins; each plucked or bowed as a unique and individualized sound or in this case movement that when viewed altogether harmonized the space. A d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 elongated into its own space, the meticulous isolation movements of the torso, the neck and the hands play their own seemingly discordant melodies until we realize, as the dancers lift one another replacing each other in space, the harmonizing effect all those melodies/movements are having not only on the space but on us. One of the most insightful elements in Fagan's work is he doesn't tell us what to see but rather how to see. It isn't the moment of movement that enthrall us as much as it is the space the movement creates; and this is so clearly evident in the closing moments of the 2nd section, titled 'Now Here'.\nIt wasn't easy for me to watch the excerpt from the tribute to Geoffrey Holder, a dance interweaving his styles, sensibilities and words from his son, Leo, choreographed last year In Memoriam. Geoffrey Holder's wife and creative partner of 59 years, dancer Carmen de Lavallade, has been a mentor and friend to me for nearly 30yrs, and by extension Geoffrey was as well. This was emotionally personal to me. But Garth Fagan utilized the choreography like a healing balm and soon it was the joy that was Geoffrey Holder that we remembered and felt. To paraphrase a quote of his used in the dance: \"Death might stop what you do, but not who you are or what you love.\" In every undulated spine, every reach of an arabesque, every curved pass\u00e9 turn Geoffrey's love was speaking. At one point, the ensemble crosses upstage right to left single file like the passage of time, and then quickly break free as if the suspension of time gave us Geoffrey Holder's dancing spirit once more.\n'In Conflict' Fagan's newest 4 part work-in-progress as the program states (however, this was the gem of"}

He might react as he did when, late in the debate, she delivered a strong answer about Social Security that referred to the taxes he\u2019s avoided paying. His features receded into a pool of curdled dust. \u201cSuch a nasty woman,\u201d he said. In 2016, a major-party nominee for President seems to have mistaken misogyny for an argument against democratic legitimacy.\n\u201cI did not say that,\u201d Trump said, as Wallace tried to keep him from interrupting. \u201cI did not say that. I did not say that.\u201d But he did say that\u2014at rallies, in front of thousands of people. And Clinton was ready with the exact quotes. (\u201cLook at her\u2014I don\u2019t think so\u201d; \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d) At a debate in which his main strategic goal might have been to make her seem untrustworthy, he blatantly tossed reality away. Trump seems incapable of talking about women without lying.\nClinton did have some weak moments, particularly with an answer about the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation that left open the matter of possible conflicts of interest, and one about her paid speeches. Wallace had posed the question about Trump and women in a way that might have been challenging for Clinton, too, by bringing up similar allegations against her husband. She ignored that aspect (and Trump let her; he was so busy calling women dishonest that he seemed to have forgotten about the women he says were telling the truth about Bill Clinton). Instead, she took the question as an opportunity to tie the larger themes of her campaign together.\n\u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like,\u201d Clinton said. That was who he was. But she was not only talking about women. \u201cI think it\u2019s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next President, how we want to bring our country together, where we don\u2019t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in its debate skits, sometimes depicts Clinton sitting back and watching Trump self-destruct, and, indeed, she couldn\u2019t help herself\u2014smiling, whether with dismay or disd"}

Our pre-Air Venture entertainment was to sit by the hangar and watch the incoming. Saw some accidents, some close calls, but mostly good. Watched the incoming and this past event, 2018, looked to have some of the poorer arrival flying I have seen in the many years. The one comment that comes close to probably covering it all was a pilot some years back who caused some real havoc when asked why he did not adhere to the NOTAM, said, \"what NOTAM?\" Fly the NOTAM.\nPilots do not read the NOTAM or do not adhere to the NOTAM or get spaced out in the zone and lose all situational awareness and so on.\nUsually I love to read Paul Bertorelli's articles and find them insightful. However the one about flying into Oshkosh was preposterous. This year\u2019s Airventure was most unusual because of the weather and the shear mass of aircraft trying to arrive in such a short window of time. The controllers who \"work\" Oshkosh are the best of the best and are specifically chosen because of their ability to work under pressure at the \"Busiest airport in the World\", EAA has already realized that something different has to be done to try to alleviate the congestion during the busiest arrival days. Trying to conduct the Mass Arrivals while all the other aircraft are trying to get into Oshkosh just exacerbated the issue this year. There have been some very good suggestions made by people who actually work as volunteers at Airventure to improve the efficiency of arriving aircraft. However the largest issue by far is that everyone tries to arrive at the same time. If you want a no hassle arrival at Oshkosh just plan to arrive a day or two sooner and you will have the whole airport to yourself.\nI did fly in this year, and because of how things happened to work out timing wise from my end, we ended up flying the VFR arrival right in the thick of things just before they closed the airspace for the day. We were one of the last ones to land, in fact. ATC did \"yell\" at a bunch of pilots. Pilots who clearly didn't read the NOTAM about proper in-trail spacing. Pilots who were blatantly skipping whole sections of the arrival, and couldn't hold altitude or airspeed. A few times, I had to get off altitude just to provide enough spacing between me and another pilot or three who either didn't see me, or didn't care. And of course there were a few pilots with a fuel emergency...or at least claimed to have a fuel emergency (it wouldn't surprise me that some pilots faked an emergency just to get in). I don't know how many pilots go charging in to OSH without a Plan B, or even, it seems, a Plan A. But I deliberately landed short of OSH to get fuel so I wouldn't have to worry about fuel, and Plan B was to go to Appleton and Plan C to Fon du lak if I couldn't get into OSH. It's really not that hard to plan for the arrival. The fact that more accidents don't happen even with so many pilots being clearly unprepared could also be a bit of \"herd immunity\"--enough other pilots are competent and prepared enough, and willing to ignore their ego, to give way to the other pilots who really shouldn't be flying the arrival. Having done the arrival twice now (once as a pilot-not-"}

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is all of those and more.\nThe Netflix comedy, which was created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock and was nominated for three awards at the 2018 People's Choice Awards, including Best Comedy Show, Best Comedy Star and Best Bingeworthy Show, tells the story of Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper), a young woman who starts a new life after escaping captivity in an underground bunker. Kimmy Schmidt tackles a variety of issues\u2014mostly with sunshiny humor\u2014including sexual assault, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sexual orientation. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is hope embodied.\n\"When I was a kid, my pastor at church used to preach this sermon every year called, \u2018Reach beyond the break, hope against hope, ask for a lifeline,' and I don't think I fully got it as a child,\" series star Tituss Burgess said during a recent set visit. \"But it's funny, I often think about the message while filming Kimmy because she, Kimmy Schmidt, is the embodiment of what that sermon's about. Her relentless zeal for life, her involuntary reaction to helping people\u2014she of all people, she's had the darkest past and yet somehow she is trapped inside hope and inside faith. It is such a beautiful lesson, you know?\"\n\"It's kind of like The Wizard of Oz. Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion are all subsidiaries or compartments of Dorothy, right? And myself, Carol Kane and [Jane Krakowski], our characters are all little slivers of Kimmy, all trapped inside our respective bunkers, if you will. And Kimmy, just by sheer existence and example, sort of ambushes us and forces us to reach beyond the brink and keep the faith, keep hope,\" Burgess continued.\n\"When I am able to zoom out of filming and just look at the actual story for what it is and be able to watch and look at it outside of myself from a spectator point of view, I'm so grateful for this show and this message because\u2014I hate to say now more than ever, but when you need it the most, it is a wonderful\u2014It serves as both a reminder and can also take your mind off\u2014simultaneously\u2014what is going on and what you need to do in the wake of what is going on,\" he concluded. \"That is what the show means to me.\"\nAfter her escape, the character of Kimmy Schmidt moved to New York and started a new life. She joined the work force, went to college, started therapy to tackle her anger PTSD and pursued a career as a crossing guard, before getting a new, real-world human resources-type of gig at a tech company. Kemper said Kimmy \"embodies what I personally aspire to, which is that she does not blame outside circumstances for her own actions or her own fate.\"\n\"She takes matters into her own hands. She endured the worst experience that someone could endure and she still doesn't, like, refer to it as, \u2018Oh, well I can't do something or achieve something because of this bad thing that happened.' Instead, she just marches forward and makes her own\u2014breaks is what I was going to say,\" Kemper said.\n\"And I find that very inspiring because I think it's easy to blame other circumstances for things that go wrong in your life and Kimmy doesn't"}

Their hopes were high but their bank account was meager.\n\"I had no idea what was going to happen. We didn't have money to buy fancy furniture or things for the wall.

But it is the Napoleon that Annemarie takes the most pleasure in making. \"It's a little complicated and has lots of stages and it looks so good when it's finished,\" she says.\nThe elder Greipels seldom go out to dinner, preferring cooking at home on Sundays and Mondays, when the restaurant is closed.

This is because the Commission could not prove that Telecom would not have introduced the 0867 package if it didn&#8217;t have Significant Market Power (SMP).\nWigley is calling for a review of Section 36 in light of the decision.\n&#8220;If there is to be change, amending legislation is required. The Courts can&#8217;t do it, as they are interpreting legislation. Until this happens, companies with SMP have a large measure of freedom to act in ways which many would regard as unsatisfactory and anti-competitive,&#8221; he says.\n&#8220;European law doesn&#8217;t tolerate that approach. Under the legislation there, Telecom&#8217;s activity was likely to be in breach. On a telecommunications appeal last year to the highest European Union Court, the judges confirmed that a company with SMP has &#8216;a special responsibility not to allow its behaviour to impair genuine undistorted competition&#8217;. That&#8217;s because competition is already weakened by the company with SMP.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s important is the precedent it (the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgement) sets for the future. Those with substantial market power (SMP) will be able to continue to exert their power much more freely. The case largely re-affirms that right. Often the Telco Act will not constrain this use of power. For example, price squeeze, issues around bundles, so-called &#8220;pocket pricing&#8221;, on- and off-net mobile pricing differentials, etc, don&#8217;t fit easily under the Telco Act. That&#8217;s where the Commerce Act should shine,&#8221; he says.\nWigley says that a robust Commerce Act is necessary, especially given that the government has ruled that the Ultra Fast Broadband network will have a 10-year regulatory reprieve &#8211; in other words the Telecommunications Act will not apply to the fledgling fibre network.\n&quot;That regulatory holiday takes away the Telecommunications Act for this critical market development. Granted, some contraints on vendor action will be contractually agreed but market problems seem inevitable with such a major monolopy player,&quot; he says.\n[UPDATED] TUANZ CEO Ernie Newman has resigned after twelve years in the role.\nVodafone is welcoming the new Telecommunications Development Levy, which will replace the old Telecommunications Service Obligation (TSO), saying it will allow the company to drive fibre to 300 cell sites that would otherwise not be economic."}

And nearly every list of demands includes mandatory sensitivity training for faculty and staff.\nOccidental students say the college hasn\u2019t done enough to address complaints of campus racism, including racially motivated harassment from other students and insensitive classroom comments. Last Thursday, more than 600 students, faculty, and staff walked out of class and held a teach-in on a quad, and then they marched to the president\u2019s home. On Monday, several hundred students occupied an administrative building, presenting school officials with a list of 14 demands, including the creation of a black studies program and the removal of LA police from campus.

There could be no denying their resilient spirit; the brilliance of Henrik Lundqvist, the first N.H.L. goalie to win five consecutive Game 7s; or the team effort that gave the players on the Rangers\u2019 current roster an 83-6 record in Game 7s.\nThe Rangers have won five Game 7s over the last three playoff seasons, a first in N.H.L. history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nBrad Richards, who scored the winning goal Tuesday, is 7-0 in Game 7s, including five with the Rangers. According to Elias, Red Kelly was the only other player to compile a 7-0 mark. Glenn Anderson and Ray Bourque each posted 8-0 records.\nThe Rangers, who for the first time in their 88-year history won a playoff series after trailing three games to one, will play Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday at Montreal. Their challenge to reach the Stanley Cup finals, however, will be daunting. Since the playoffs expanded beyond two rounds in 1968, no team has won the Cup after playing the maximum 14 games in the first two rounds. In Round 1, the Rangers eliminated Philadelphia.\nThe Rangers have been at an equally fatiguing juncture before. In 2012, they reached the Eastern Conference finals after winning two seven-game series, but lost to the Devils in Game 6 in overtime.\nThe Canadiens advanced by beating the Bruins, 3-1, in Game 7 in Boston on Wednesday after defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in four games in the first round.\nIf the Rangers hope to buck history, they will probably need the help of Rick Nash, their silenced goal-scoring star. Nash has no goals and five assists in 14 postseason games.\nThe odds suggest that Nash is bound to break through. He has 52 shots on goal, the most in the N.H.L. playoffs. His Corsi number, a statistic that measures puck possession, is second to Kevin Klein on the Rangers.\nPerhaps no team has benefited more from the N.H.L.\u2019s new playoff structure than the Rangers. With the first two rounds focused on division play, the Rangers drew the Flyers, a team they matched up well against. Then they moved on to meet the Penguins, chronic underachievers who have been eliminated by a lower-seeded team in five consecutive years.\nUnder the previous playoff system, the Rangers would have opened against the Canadiens, a tougher opponent than the Flyers. In the second round, they would probably have met the Bruins, bigger and badder than the Penguins.\nThe ax was expected to fall on Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma, who was being blamed for Sidney Crosby\u2019s ineffective performance against the Rangers and in other recent playoff seasons."}

The acquisition will extend Harmonic&apos;s worldwide customer base and strengthen its market and technology leadership, particularly in international video broadcast, contribution and distribution markets.\nUnder the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Harmonic will pay $5.62 in cash for each outstanding share of Scopus, representing an enterprise value of approximately $51 million, net of Scopus&apos; cash and short-term investments. The proposed acquisition is subject to customary conditions, regulatory approvals and the approval of Scopus&apos; shareholders, and is expected to close in the latter part of the first quarter of 2009. Harmonic has received voting agreements supporting the proposed acquisition from shareholders representing approximately 50% of Scopus&apos; outstanding shares.\nHarmonic expects to realize cost synergies upon full integration of Scopus of $8-10 million on an annualized basis, making the transaction accretive to Harmonic&apos;s non-GAAP earnings in 2009, exclusive of the amortization of intangibles and non-recurring charges such as restructuring and transaction costs. Harmonic will determine the appropriate purchase accounting for the transaction at closing and, accordingly, cannot reasonably estimate the impact on GAAP earnings at this time. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nFor the first nine months of 2008, Scopus reported revenues of $55.4 million, an increase of 35% over the comparable period of the prior year. Approximately 79% of these revenues were outside the United States, with no single customer representing more than 10% of total revenues. Scopus has approximately 300 employees worldwide.\n\"This acquisition extends Harmonic&apos;s diversification strategy, providing us with an expanded international sales force and customer base, particularly in video broadcast, contribution and distribution markets, as well as complementary video processing technology and expanded research and development capability,\" said Patrick Harshman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Harmonic. \"Like Harmonic, Scopus has strong gross margins and a proven track record of innovation and growth.

The Bank recorded similarly strong earnings for year-to-date 2012, with net income available to common shareholders of $5.7 million or $1.80 per common share (diluted), compared with $3.9 million or $1.23 per common share (diluted) in the first nine months of 2011, an increase of 48%. Year-to-date 2012 net income available to common shareholders included gains on the discretionary sale of securities. Excluding these gains in 2012, net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 would have totaled $4.9 million, resulting in a 26% increase in 2012 net income over the 2011 comparable period.\nTotal assets at September 30, 2012 increased 8% to $820.1 million, compared to $758.9 million at September 30, 2011.

Can it stay on top if the whole of the rest of the world goes over to clay or concrete, leaving Wimbledon alone with its fickle grass? Can it stay on top if players feel the attitude of the British tennis establishment is out of date?\nThese are serious questions. And they'll be answered mainly by the quality of this year's tournament.\nHow McEnroe handles the tournament -- and how the establishment handles the temperamental American who has had so many disputes here over the years with officials, press, and fans -- also will be a key.\nTennis is never predictable, but most experts expect a McEnroe-Jimmy Connors final. Connors is in exceptionally good form and has just beaten John in the final of a pre-Wimbledon tournament at Queen's Club in London.\nBut there's a real ''wild card'' in the pack -- 17-year-old Mats Wilander of Sweden who recently became the youngest ever French Open champion, beating the record of his countryman, Borg, by a few months.\nMats is seeded seventh here after McEnroe, Connors, Americans Vitas Gerulaitis and Sandy Mayer, South Africa's Johan Kriek, and Gene Mayer, Sandy's younger brother.

{"idx": "9515", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check to see if your claims regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proved. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proved by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor asks for multiple audit procedures on the same account.\nAccounts receivable confirmations mainly serve to prove the existence assertion. The existence assertion is management's claim that the accounts receivable that are recorded on the balance sheet are real. The logic is that if a customer will readily admit to owing a balance to your firm, the account receivable probably exists. If the customer disputes the balance, more work is done to determine where the discrepancy lies. Sometimes the customer will not respond to the confirmation request. In this case, the auditor will need additional information that proves the obligation was outstanding at the balance sheet date.\nThe rights assertion is management's contention that the accounts receivable belong to the company. In most companies, this isn't an issue. However, this assertion gets called into question if the company has a factoring arrangement, by which it sells receivables to another company, known as the factor, at a discount. The factor gets a discount, but the company doesn't have to worry about collecting from customers. In some of these arrangements, title to the receivables passes to the factor; the accounts receivable no longer belong to the company, so the company should not carry the receivables on the balance sheet. Accounts receivable confirmations provide almost no ability to detect factoring arrangements. In many cases, customers do not know that their receivables have been factored. As such, they will indicate that the balance is owed to the original company. Therefore, auditors will look for these arrangements by talking with management and examining cash receipts for factor payments.\nCompleteness is the quality that the financial statements contain all transactions that actually occurred. This is most often thought of in terms of unrecorded liabilities. However, accounts receivable may be incomplete if the company has not recorded sales so it can fraudulently reduce income tax liability. Confirmations do not provide much assurance related to the completeness assertion. However, if the auditor sends a blank confirmation, asking a customer to list all balances owed, any balances not recorded may be uncovered. Because this does not address any customers with no balances recorded, auditors will also look at cash receipts after the year-end date. These cash inflows should be traceable to sales after year-end or recorded receivables.\nThe valuation assertion tells financial statement users that the numbers on the front of the statement are correct. That is, the correct numeric value is stated. Accounts receivable have two main valuation concerns. First, you must record the correct balance in the first place. Accounts receivable confirmations help determine if this is the case. Generally accepted accounting principles, however, require that accounts receivable are presented on the financial statements minus a reduction for accounts that will turn out to be uncollectible. This estimate is made by looking at the company's collection history. The auditor will determine if an appropriate allowance has been made by examining the inputs to this estimate and determining if the calculations and methodology make sense."}

Goyer, in the epic Dark Knight Trilogy, which is still the best thing to happen to the character. In this Rewind Review, we journey back to 2008 to take a look at the best of the bunch, The Dark Knight.\nThe Dark Knight is the follow-up to Batman Begins (2005), and sees billionaire Bruce Wayne continuing his fight against the criminal underworld as masked vigilante, Batman. But nothing can prepare him for the rise of the Joker, an unstable force of nature that pushes Batman towards confronting the consequences of his actions.\nCo-written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the movie plays out like a crime thriller, rather than a superhero film, with Batman attempting to thwart a psychopathic terrorist in clown makeup that knows exactly which buttons to press.\nChristian Bale returns as the Dark Knight and continues his brilliant performance to near perfection. He manages to bring all three of Bruce\u2019s personalities a sense of realism, whether that\u2019s as Bruce Wayne in the public, the real Bruce with Alfred, and of course, Batman himself.\nThis time around, Bale brings gets to explore a more fragile side to the character, stepping away from the anger of Batman Begins. His relationship with Alfred feels deeper, and even provides a few laughs, but not as many as the films antagonist.\nThe Clown Prince of Crime is played by the late Heath Ledger, who won a post-humus award for his performance.

{"idx": "9519", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Following Dirty Den's spectacular departure from EastEnders, Leslie Grantham appeared in a commercial. Lying in a sud-filled bath, Grantham asked if there was life after soap. He wore a nervous smile, a smell of desperation to his nonchalance. That's because, even as recently as the mid-80s, leaving a soap opera was a risky business. For every Nick Berry, there'd be an Anita Dobson or a Leslie Grantham.\nNow, the post-soap path to glory seems more assured. On Thursday, Patsy Palmer makes her post-EastEnders debut in McCready & Daughter, a one-off detective drama written by Robert Jones, co-creator of award-winning BBC2 series, The Cops.\nPalmer plays the wayward daughter of a down-at-heel private eye (Lorcan Cranitch from Ballykissangel), gumshoeing his way round the crisp packets of Kilburn. She makes an explosive entrance, setting fire to her landlady's flat. In a bizarre continuation of the EastEnders storyline on which she left, Palmer escapes her old life by going to college (though her new character, Clare, has none of the enthusiasm for the project, the animus that fired Bianca on to a better life).\nPalmer is a fantastically good actress, as her sustained wail of pain in EastEnders testified. And there can be little doubt that the BBC will use her fame to promote what could otherwise be just another bog-standard detective drama. A trick previously pulled off with another ex-Ender, Michelle Collins, in Real Women.\nPalmer's co-star, Cranitch, has his own soap demons to live down, graduating from Ballykissangel (or Cosykissangel as unkind critics dubbed it). BallyK took a darker turn with the arrival of Cranitch, who played a married man with a permanently furrowed brow, weighed down by a doomed affair. Cranitch is burnt into my memory from an earlier role, brilliantly playing a weak, corruptible and just-this-side-of-psychotic detective in Cracker.\nCoincidentally, Robert Jones originally devised the part of McCready for another actor: Tony Doyle, who played alongside Cranitch in BallyK, and who died suddenly at the beginning of production. The baton was passed to Cranitch - not an obvious choice for lead, but all the more interesting for that.\nTogether, Cranitch and Palmer make a formidable double-act. There's a bruised quality to both performances which, sadly, the script doesn't take full advantage of. Not least because it leans uncomfortably towards comedy when it could have gone darker.\nNowadays it seems inconceivable that there are any permutations of the detective double-act left to try out: Man/Man; Woman/Woman; Man/Woman; Man/Dog; Woman/ Cat; Man/Car; Dead Man/Live Man; Mystic/Hippie, and spoofs of all of the above.\nMcCready & Daughter concentrates on the domestic complexities of the modern family: resoldering broken relationships; making peace with the ex; scratching a living from a business that happens to be a room above a shop in Kilburn, not a dot.com co in London's overly trendy Clerkenwell district.\nIt's a paradox that writers of middle-brow dramas, detective or otherwise, have taken over"}

Since the weather has gotten colder, the number of eagles in our area is increasing every week. The Lower Wisconsin River Valley is a wintering area for bald eagles from northern Wisconsin and beyond due to the open water, abundant fish supply, and good areas for roosting (large trees and valleys) out of the harshness of winter.\nFish are the main food for the eagles and as the Wisconsin and northern states open water freezes up; eagles migrate to locations where the water stays open to winter. The Wisconsin River from the dam at Prairie du Sac to the confluence with the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien stays open allowing the eagles to feed on the abundant fish supply in the rivers waters. The heavily wooded areas, undeveloped shorelines, and deep valleys along the river also give the birds locations to roost and stay out of winter\u2019s winds.\nThe last few weeks of colder weather has pushed many of the migrating eagles southward to our part of Wisconsin where many of the birds stay till early March. Another interesting fact is that more bald eagles are choosing to stay in this area year-round. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources counts the nesting eagles in the state and every year the number of eagles nesting in our area and the rest of Wisconsin has been increasing.\nThe local eagle organization, the Ferry Bluff Eagle Council, is a local organization that The Ferry Bluff Eagle Council (www.ferrybluffeaglecouncil.org) is a local organization whose goal is to \u201cprotect, enhance, and maintain Bald Eagle habitat in the Sauk Prairie area through education, research, and management activities.\u201d This is the 28th year that the FBEC has had an early December count by its volunteers. This past weekend was the second Sunday that club volunteers gathered at 10 different locations from Sauk Prairie to Lone Rock. Much data and information is gathered from the FBEC members throughout the winter till early March. Check out the group\u2019s website for more information on these magnificent birds that has been collected over its 28 years of existence.\nThe highlight of the winter is the Bald Eagle Watching Days on January 12-13 in Sauk Prairie. There is many things for the entire family this weekend in January which include; tours around the area where one will see eagles on bus tours to good eagle watching locations, talks at the River Arts Center where people can hear and learn about our nation\u2019s symbol, activities for the children which relate information on these birds, talks by experts, and often a release of injured eagles that have been rehabilitated and released back to the wild. These are just a few of the activities and events that anyone who likes nature and wildlife will enjoy. This is an enjoyable and educational weekend for the entire family with something everyone will enjoy.\nThere are many eagles in the area now and it\u2019s a good time to visit the area before the crowds come later in the winter.

Though covered in Europe, the speech received little notice in the United States.\nWiner cited the weakness of government supervision over a global system that moves vast sums of money electronically, often through poorly regulated offshore banks.

The message from Washington remained cold-turkey market \"reform,\" rather than an effective government civil service to regulate the emerging financial and business markets.\nThe crisis in Russia is not unique, nor \"even that unusual,\" Winer said. \"The global raging bear market (of summer 1998) is merely the freshest reminder that global capital flows and global technologies have out-paced the ability of governments either to discourage or to respond effectively to sudden, wild gyrations in financial markets.\"\nWiner pointed to similar shortcomings in the financial systems of Mexico, Japan and tottering Asian economies.\n\"As technology globalized financial markets beyond national borders, governments, regulators and law-enforcement agencies stayed at home,\" Winer said. \"We created a financial services electronic highway without enforceable speed limits and without highway patrols.\"\nFor example, Winer cited a State Department review of offshore banks located on Pacific atolls known as the Cook Islands. These lightly populated islands of 18,000 residents hosted 3,000 anonymous trusts. Many of these trusts were connected to organized crime, Russian businessmen and some of the most notorious financial players in the Asia-Pacific region, Winer said.\nWiner recommended that an initial reform would be to establish stiffer regulations against money laundering.\nA"}

Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the New York City subway, his longtime nemesis in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio, is proposing a new tax on wealthy New Yorkers to help fix the ailing system. On Monday, de Blasio will announce what the New York Times refers to as a \"millionaires tax\" to help repair the deteriorating system, which is plagued by delays, mechanical issues, and even derailments, the AP reports. The tax would also subsidize reduced fares for low-income riders. The tax would bump the top income rate from 3.9% to 4.4% for couples who make more than $1 million per year and individuals who make more than $500,000. It would affect just under 1% of people filing taxes in the city.\nThat's the knee-jerk reaction of any politician: more taxes. How about being efficient with the exorbitant amount of taxes they demand now? Average worker pays about 33% of gross income in taxes. Plus property taxes, vehicle taxes, sales tax, etc. We're taxed when we earn money. We're taxed when we spend money. We're taxes when we save money. How about no new taxes.\nAs usual poor conservatives bristle with hate over the idea. They would starve their families and die to keep a rich man getting richer. How can reason with such people?\nIf NYC taxed every millionaire at a 100% tax rate, it still wouldn't keep the subway running, because they can leave. The Nazis had the Jews. The Left has the 1%.

And I'm using it less and less each day.\nMy fading relationship with my iPad reminds me of a long-ago college fling with a young lovely. High anticipation, fervent consummation, growing familiarization, decreasing fascination, and the inevitable: \"No, hon, it's not you. It's me.\"\nWhich is the line you use even when you're pretty damn sure that it is indeed her.\nFull disclosure: I write this as a fervent fanboi who has used Macs since literally the first day that the original Macintosh 128k became available in 1984. I've partnered with and enjoyed PowerBooks, Quadras, Performas, iMacs, Power Macs, MacBooks, Mac Pros, and iPhones \u2014 even a Newton.\nBut of all of those Apple products, it's my whirlwind affair with the Newton that most reminds me of my first 56 days with my iPad.\nWith the Newton, as with the iPad, I eagerly anticipated its release, and bagged one as soon as I could. I took it on business trips for note-taking and email, had no problems with its much-maligned handwriting recognition, and even played the occasional game on it.\nBut after the first blush of novelty wore off, the Newton's flaws asserted themselves: small display, unpocketable bulk, non-standard file system, and so on. I found myself spending less and less time with it, and soon returned to my previous partner, my trusty PowerBook 170.\nSo it has been with the iPad. I've taken it on business trips for note-taking and email, have had no problems with its much-maligned keyboard, and even play the occasional game. But I'm spending less and less time with it. As a fanboi, I'd like to say that the jury is still out, but I'm afraid that the most important evidence \u2014 that I'm less frequently using the li'l guy for either business or pleasure \u2014 is in. My iPad is clearly moving into Newtonian territory.\nNot that the iPad is a steaming turd, as many rabid Apple-bashers like to fulminate. Nor is it a useless toy. For example, it's been a helpful business partner in meetings and interviews due to its abilities as an unobtrusive, silent note-taker with no display to get between me and my interview subject. What's more, Apple's well-engineered $39 iPad Case holds the iPad at the perfect typing angle.\nThe iPad's instant-on capability makes it more of an impulse-satisfier than a laptop could ever be. I can, for example, quickly check MLB.com's At Bat 2010 for iPad at any time to find out how badly the San Francisco Giants are losing.\nApple may have left out a good deal of functionality in iPad 1.0, but there are apps available to provide some of its missing capabilities. Air Sharing HD ($9.99), for example, provides a usable file system and enables printing by way of wireless printer-sharing (Mac OS X or Linux only).\nThe iPad's battery life is truly impressive, although charging it is a bit of a pain.

{"idx": "9545", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Making the most of the great weather, I was spoilt for choice on what to do last weekend. The city was overflowing with outdoor events, from golf tournaments to marathons and weekly markets. I chose to meet some friends at a family event in Dubai.\nAs you would expect, there was a main stage, a plethora of food trucks and pop-up stores. It was packed with families and kids with painted faces. Posting a few pics on Insta, I got a few DMs asking me where I was (back in London temperatures are barely breaking double figures). Of course, I\u2019m in Dubai, at a mini-festival, I replied \u2014 mainly to reiterate we do pretty much the same outdoor activities here in the UAE as in the UK, only without the threat of rain to spoil the day.\nFood trucks have made a huge bang in the culinary scene across the region. However, the concept of street food has been skewed in terms of pricing. When I lived and worked in London, I would often walk down to Borough Market, a daily food market close to Tower Bridge. There would be a huge choice of independent vendors, from Thai to Spanish. The food was affordable; roughly the same as a fast food meal deal.\nThe concept of food trucks or wagons, as they were known, dates back to 1866. Charles Goodnight (great name) would serve food to cattlemen from a horse-drawn freight wagon in America\u2019s west. It was known as \u2018The Chuck Wagon\u2019.\nThere are now much stricter hygiene regulations regarding food trucks, but what I don\u2019t understand is why the food sold is so expensive. It\u2019s no secret food in the UAE is costly \u2014 statistics issued by Dubai customs show that in 2018 Dh44.6 billion worth of food was imported.\nSo back to the mini-festival. Perusing the line of food trucks, I decided on spicy wings. BBQ chicken is way up there on my food love list. I placed my order and waited, and I got my food. Now to use the word disappointed would be an understatement. In my head I was thinking, I\u2019ve just paid Dh50 for four wings and about 10 fat chips. That\u2019s 10 pounds in my money. Where had this chicken been sourced from, and had it been privately schooled? This certainly wasn\u2019t cheap chicken.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the wings were delicious, and by far the tastiest chicken I have eaten in some time. But Dh50, come on. A 500g pack of chicken pieces is on average Dh10, and to cheat, a bottle of BBQ sauce is approximately Dh12. That\u2019s Dh22 for a big pile of chicken. I appreciate there are costs involved in running a food truck, but there are no waiters, tables to clear and all the packaging is disposable. So operational costs are low, right?\nThe recipe alongside is my money-saving BBQ chicken recipe for you to try at home, or to even take along to a weekend outdoor event. I do love food trucks but the prices always leave a bad taste in my mouth. A free event shouldn\u2019t turn out to be an expensive family day out.\nPlace the oil in a saucepan, heat over low, add the shallots, saute for five minutes until soft.

Jewish Family Service conducted renovations and opened its doors in early March.\nSupervisory Nathan Fletcher, a Democrat, said the shelter is a warm welcome to those who are fleeing their home countries.\n\"Think about if you had to take your children on a 1,500-mile trek evading smugglers and human traffickers and not sure where your next meal will come from or safety and then you make it to a place that shows you love and compassion,\" Fletcher said. \"That could be any of our children and I just think when you look in the eyes of these children it really motivates you to make sure we do this right.\"\nThe five-member county board approved the $1 lease in January with only Supervisor Jim Desmond, a Republican, voting against it.

Families staying there have claimed asylum and were recently released from federal custody.

{"idx": "9558", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Much has been written about how and why marketers need to focus their efforts on younger generations. The ways millennials consume information and interact with brands is having a large influence on older generations too. Throughout recent history, new media habits generally start with the young and migrate to everyone else over time. In 2016, no self-respecting senior citizen will be without an iPhone or Facebook account so all marketers need to be thinking mobile first for their marketing outreach.\nMobile first is a change in mindset from the past. Traditional sports\u2019 marketing was rooted in one-way interruptive advertising and old fashion brand building. Teams would trot out their annual ad campaign and themes usually to generate ticket sales and excitement for the upcoming season. The theme would center on a combination of new season optimism and past team tradition. While nostalgia can be worthwhile tactic, today\u2019s consumers seem less interested in the past and more engaged in the now and in real time. A new approach is needed for mobile connected consumers and our \u201calways on\u201d media environment. It is less \u201cbig campaign\u201d based and more of a constant stream of compelling social content in multiple formats, especially video and info graphics.\nThe smartphone has become a permanent appendage to consumers of all ages. It is startling to see how much time people spend looking down at their phone while attending sporting events or watching them on TV. Today\u2019s consumer wants to be connected to their networks and do more than just passively watch the game. They want to be part of the action. Tech Republic reports that, in a bid to attract Millennials, stadiums and teams are moving to become Wi-Fi-enabled tech palaces.\nTech enablement is important because consumers want to connect, publish and share these experiences. One of the many important characteristics of younger consumers is the need for self-publishing. It could be live tweeting during a game they watch on TV or posting images or videos on Instagram from a game they are attending in person. It is important to understand this change in consumer behavior \u2014 privacy and modesty take a back seat to self-expression. Teams should encourage this behavior with prompts and active community engagement with fans on social media.\nThe other advantage of a mobile-first strategy is that it can provide a better way to sell tickets and concessions at events. Mobile payments are getting off to a slow start but will eventually become an accepted way of conducting transactions. In addition to accepting Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Wallet on site at stadiums, leagues should develop apps like Starbucks\u2019 very success mobile payment app. Team-branded payment apps could be used to buy food, tickets and merchandise while generating loyalty points. In addition to streamlining operations, it would encourage an increase in sales.\nFor example, having a code on your phone scanned is a lot less painful than forking over nearly $8 in cash for a 12-ounce beer (roughly eight times the retail price) at Fenway Park, the most expensive place to see a game. Wi-Fi-enabled stadiums; social interaction and mobile payments are just some of ways teams can retool their marketing to appeal to a changing consumer who is attached to their mobile device.\n1 comment about \"Sports Teams Need to Think Mobile First\".\nShelby Rawson from CTMinteractive, December 31, 2015 at 11:03 p.m.\nGreat read. Glad to have been turned on to this content. Appreciate the insight. Looking forward to hearing more from you."}

The group has taken the lead in the fight against Ebola in West Africa.\nThe president of Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Joanne Liu, has been sharply critical of the weak and late international response to Ebola. And she worries that now U.S. attention has been distracted by the few cases here at home when a massive response is needed to the epidemic raging in West Africa. Doctors Without Borders has decades of experience on the front lines fighting Ebola in Africa. But Doctor Liu told me the scale of this outbreak is unprecedented.\nJOANNE LIU: Before our biggest centers were about 30 beds, 40 beds. Now, we are at 200, 250 beds. There's nothing like this that we've been faced with before. But by the fact of having such big centers, we are contracted on a daily basis to numerous cases of death. And being confronted with death on a daily basis, it's absolutely distressing, if not traumatizing, for our staff. Since the case fatality rate is between 50 to 70 percent depending when people are presenting, it means that in a center of 200 beds, you can imagine how many people you will have to - I will have to say take care and accompany towards their last journey. So that is absolutely distressing. The other thing that we've never done before is building crematorium - that, as far as I'm concerned, MSF has never done that. And we're so upset by that. I keep telling myself, MSF, Doctors Without Borders, we are meant to save lives and ensure people will live, but not take care of dead bodies.\nBLOCK: With so much focus on Ebola right now in West Africa, what's happening with regular care, the work that you would ordinarily be doing in terms of infectious disease or delivering babies, anything like that?\nLIU: Right now what we're facing - it's the collapse of health care infrastructure. Right now, the WHO data is saying that there were about 400 health care staff infected in the region, half of them have died. I think these are underestimated figures. So what we are facing right now is the fact that we don't have enough staff - medical staff - to run medical facilities. And in some places where we can still run medical facilities because there were so many people who were infected or because there are still some currently people infected, it became a vector of infection to the population. So now we are facing what we call the emergency within the emergency, it's the access to basic health care. And right now, we are facing the ridiculous situation that someone might not die of Ebola, but might die of malaria that is easily treatable or an HIV patient doesn't have access for his anti-retroviral medicine for the last few weeks, if not the last few months. So this is a disastrous situation in terms of basic health care access.\nBLOCK: It does seem that Doctors Without Borders is able to set up treatment centers quite quickly - much more quickly than it's, for example, taken for the U.S. government to set up treatment centers in Liber"}

{"idx": "9568", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In May this year we will be marking the 80th anniversary of the General Strike of 1926. It was one of the struggles that, during the 20th century, marked out the British working class as having tremendous strength and combativity \u2013 but also craven and incompetent leaders.\nYet today one side of this equation seems to be missing. The trade union leaders haven\u2019t changed \u2013 indeed, in their general willingness to accept cuffs, insults and the odd scrap of a concession from Tony Blair, they have set new standards for servility and cowardice.\nBut rank and file workers have only rarely taken the initiative for themselves in recent years. This picture contrasts sharply with that of the early 1970s.\nThe offensive then mounted by the Tory government of Ted Heath was greeted by tremendous resistance. In industries like the docks, mining and engineering, it was rank and file activists, not full-time union officials, that made the running.\nThere is an obvious explanation for this difference. The strong workplace organisation than eventually broke Heath\u2019s government was targeted by his Tory successor Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.\nHer eventual defeat of the traditional vanguard of the organised working class \u2013 the miners, dockers and car workers \u2013 and the massive rundown of manufacturing industry from the early 1980s onwards undermined rank and file workers\u2019 confidence in their own power.\nThe balance of power within the unions tilted decisively in favour of the full-time officials. This has made it much easier for the trade union leadership to cut deals with the government and the employers that have, again and again, sold jobs and working conditions.\nThe result has been a vicious circle in which the union leaders\u2019 refusal to fight has led to defeat after defeat, further eroding workers\u2019 confidence and making yet more sell outs possible.\nThere was nothing inevitable about this pattern. There have been key moments when the situation could have been turned round.\nHad the entire working class movement rallied around the miners during the summer of 1984, or when the pit closures were announced in autumn 1992, or around the dockers when Thatcher attacked them in the summer of 1989, or around the firefighters when they felt the weight of Tony Blair\u2019s boot in the winter of 2002-3, there could have a dramatic shift in the balance of class forces.\nWe only have to look across the channel to France to see a situation where a cycle of mass revolts \u2013 1995, 2003, 2005 and now 2006 \u2013 has seriously impeded ruling class attempts to restructure society along neo-liberal lines.\nThe important question, however, is not just to understand this history, but to see how the British workers\u2019 movement can escape from its burden. Here looking at the past for models can be misleading.\nThe strength of the organised working class in this country lay for much of the 20th century in strong sectional workplace organisation. The most important example of this kind of organisation was provided by the shop stewards in engineering \u2013 lay workplace delegates.\nThe shop stewards and their counterparts in other industries drew their power from the confidence they won from their fellow workers in fighting day-to-day economic struggles around pay and conditions.\nThis was how the organised working class was rebuilt in the 1930s and 1940s after the defeat of the General Strike and the Great Depression.

Outside the wire, Adolf Hitler's forces showed no signs of giving up.\nCold and hungry, the North Carolinian made a difficult decision. He slipped the gold aviator's ring \ufffd a gift from his parents \ufffd off his finger and passed it through a fence to an Italian POW, who handed back a couple of chocolate bars.\nHe would never again see the ring. But it did not disappear.\nLast week, about a dozen family members and friends gathered in the living room of David C. Cox Jr.'s Raleigh home and watched as he slit open a small yellow parcel from Germany. The 67-year-old son dug through the crinkly packing material and carefully removed a little plastic box.\n\"And here it is,\" he said with a long sigh as he pulled out the ring. \"Oh, my goodness. ... I never thought it would ever happen. I thought it was gone. We all thought it was gone.\n\"He thought it was gone,\" he said of his late father.\nThe story of how the ring made it back to the Cox family is a testament to a former enemy's generosity, the reach of the Internet and the healing power of time.\nFollowing the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the elder Cox left college and enlisted. The Army Air Corps accepted him on his second application.\nHe graduated from flight school on July 26, 1942. That same day, he married his high school sweetheart, Hilda Walker.\nTo celebrate his commission, Irvin and Connie Bell Cox presented their middle son with a gold signet ring, the oval emblazoned with a raised propeller and wings.

He parachuted into a rose garden, was taken prisoner, interrogated and then shipped to Stalag Luft III, the POW camp made famous in the Steve McQueen film, \"The Great Escape.\"\nHe remained there until January 1945, when he and the other Allied officers were force-marched three days through the snow, then packed into train cars for another three days before ending up at Stalag VII-A near Moosburg, northeast of Munich.\nAs Hitler's Third Reich collapsed upon itself,"}

That was about four years after George M. Pullman, the railroad sleeping car magnate, began building what he envisioned as a model industrial community.\nShe remembers many of the shops in the self-contained community, such as the grocery where you could buy ''on the book'' (on credit), or the other grocery, Thompson`s, where you had to pay cash. And there was Schroeder`s dry goods store and Woodward`s funeral parlor.\nMamie Stanley remembers the wooden sidewalks and the trolley cars and the horses and buggies and when Cottage Grove Avenue was called Pullman Avenue.\nShe remembers that day in 1892 when her aunt was late in returning with biscuits from the bakery. She and her mother also were wondering what had happened to the firefighters who always came over for their meals.\nShe remembers the dark days of 1894, when the bloody Pullman strikes idled the workers and brought federal troops to the community.\nShe remembers with disgust the woman who pretended to sympathize with the strikers by wearing the white ribbon that indicated support for the walkout.\nMost of all she remembers her dislike for George M. Pullman.\nHer 75-year-old son John remembers his late father, who painted stripes on the cars, vowing that his three sons would never work for Pullman.\n''My father told us he would feed us for the rest of our lives but he would never let us work there,'' John Stanley said.\nThe community of Pullman was the ultimate company town, a place where you lived, worked, played, worshiped, drank and shopped in places either run by Pullman or rented from him. A few miles away, Pullman even operated a farm that provided many of the food products sold in the town.\nPullman has been described by historians alternately as a benevolent visionary who was interested in the welfare of his workers or a calculating mercenary who set up a feudal system of virtually indentured workers.\nRegardless his motivation, his experiment in a model community was doomed.\nThe town had a definite class structure, with executives permitted to live around its centerpiece, the Hotel Florence (named after Pullman`s favorite child).\nWorkers were not allowed in the hotel, which was reserved for upper-scale visitors only. The hierarchy continued throughout the town, with the cheapest housing being the furthest from the hotel.\nMamie Stanley said one of the chief"}

The medical school's new dean, Dr. Jeffrey Flier, seems to agree to a certain extent. According to the Times, Flier doesn't want to \"tighten the spigot\" on industry money: \"One entirely appropriate source, if done properly, is industrial funds,\" he said.\nBut Flier also \"wants Harvard to catch up with the best practices at other leading medical schools.\" He recently formed a 19-member committee to \"re-examine\" Harvard's conflict-of-interest policies, which the Times says currently do not require faculty members \"to report specific amounts received for speaking or consulting, other than broad indications like 'more than $30,000.'\" Nor are there \"limits on companies' making outright gifts to faculty -- free meals, tickets, trips or the like.\"\nOn the other hand, Harvard Medical School does require all professors and lecturers to \"disclose their industry ties in class -- a blanket policy that has been adopted by no other leading medical school.\"\nThe committee examining these policies will meet on Thursday, but any suggestions to sever the school's ties with industry will likely meet a wall of opposition.

A New York bank is caught up in a money-laundering probe involving the Russian mob and perhaps billions of dollars. Federal agents say Russian \"moles\" in Western banks might be assisting in illegal transfers. Auditors are trying to learn what happened to IMF funds the Russian central bank shifted offshore.\nThe reason all this is now a big topic is that it may become an issue in the American presidential race. That's because Vice President Al Gore is co-chairman of the bilateral commission overseeing US-Russian relations.\nCritics, including former US diplomats, say Mr. Gore and his staff ignored clear evidence of widespread corruption in Russia. Gore's defenders say he often warned the Russians about corruption's dangers. Critics also attack the Clinton administration for engineering billions in IMF loans to Russia while winking at Moscow's lack of sound economic practices.\nThere's plenty of blame to go around. Most of it lies in Moscow. But before Washington plays a \"who lost Russia\" game, it's worth considering the roots of this problem.\nSeventy-four years of communism in Russia created a Potemkin economy that collapsed of its own internal contradictions. Trying to build a market economy from scratch shook every ex-Communist state.\nSome had an advantage. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia are Western in culture and could remember the old capitalist days. But those countries from the Byzantine tradition, especially Russia, didn't have that cultural background to draw on.\nMoscow has yet to build the infrastructure for a market economy to flourish. It still lacks laws allowing land-ownership, safeguarding investors' rights, or providing for contract enforcement. Accounting standards are shoddy. Soviet-style bureaucratic meddling in business continues.\nLike thin grass on a lawn, these weaknesses, combined with a legacy of official secrecy, leaves ample room for the weeds of corruption, cronyism, and gangsterism to sprout.\nThe West overestimates how much it can influence Russia. It can help on the margins and use IMF credits to prod actions necessary for progress. The Clinton administration is correctly cautious in deciding whether to support more IMF loans.\nBut there is hope. Younger Russians are more attuned to what must be done. And many entrepreneurs flourish and create jobs - without mob tactics. The US and its allies need to find ways to aid them, while ensuring new loans don't end up enriching gangsters and oligarchs.\nOther aid or credits should continue if they can aid democracy and arms control or serve humanitarian purposes. Paying to help Russia dismantle unsafe or aging nuclear weapons and reactors, for example, is well worth it.\nReforming Russia takes patience, perhaps decades of it.

That means Hillary Clinton, long presumed to be the front-runner in the fight for the Democratic nomination for president, needs to sharpen her rhetoric on regulation and income inequality.\nDespite sounding an increasingly populist note during her campaign, Clinton is hardly known as a foe of the financial industry. She has given many lucrative speeches at the likes of Goldman Sachs, and her early denouncements of hedge funds and big banks were met with amusement and rolled eyes on the Street.\nSome on Wall Street think powerful populist pitches from former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley and Sanders, coupled with the heavy influence of noncandidate Elizabeth Warren, could force Clinton to come out harder on issues including breaking up the nation\u2019s largest banks, imposing a financial transaction tax, putting individual bankers in jail, cracking down on executive pay, and otherwise beating up on an industry that six years after the financial crisis still suffers from rock-bottom public-opinion ratings.\nClinton is expected to continue to ratchet up the tone she debuted during her \u201clistening tour\u201d of Iowa, when the candidate bemoaned the influence of money in politics and said that low-income truck drivers shouldn\u2019t pay more taxes than hedge-fund managers. Few, however, expect her to go as far as O\u2019Malley, who has called for the prosecution of big bankers, or Sanders, who has openly pushed for breaking up the country\u2019s largest banks.\nIt\u2019s almost refreshing how open nearly all parties are about their belief that Clinton would never argue for reining in the financial industry if she didn\u2019t absolutely have to in order to make her way to the White House. Presumably waiting to see whether she can overcome that perception are Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York mayor Bill de Blasio, both of whom are progressive champions and have yet to endorse Clinton.\nOn the other side of that calculus is Clinton\u2019s donor base, which is richly populated with folks who work on Wall Street. Clinton is struggling to raise the type of money that Bush has already raised before declaring his candidacy, and the Democrats have far fewer donors willing to write checks in the six to eight figure range than the Republicans do.\nAll of this makes for an ugly, rather dispiriting balancing act\u2014one that we can all look forward to watching unfold over the more than 500 days left between today and Election Day."}

There is a breed of journo who will never leave the trenches of politicians\u2019 door stops, the cold and lonely halls of the magistrates court or even their local oval to report on a bit of park footy over a warm three-buck tinnie.\nBut in the reality of a media market that is devastating newsrooms and shoving some incredibly experienced journalism minds out the door, so many are seeking the relative comfort (compared with the graveyard shift at a newsroom, anyway) of a marketing or comms role.\nTo those people I say this: fearlessly preserve and apply your journalistic expertise in marketing. We bloody well need it.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen again and again. Too many journos who end up in content marketing, PR and comms roles deviate to boring comms speak, overblown brand claims and prioritising absolute garbage over what will captivate and move an audience towards a positive action.

And that's always quite worrying,\" he added, noting that many aspiring bombmakers try and fail.\nObserving the more common trend in recent years for U.K. terror perpetrators to select cars or knives as the weapon of choice, the security expert said the level of sophistication needed to construct this device will have authorities asking whether the operative was a part of a larger operation.\n\"To build a successful bomb, that actually will detonate at the right moment that you need it to, requires a little bit more effort and skill. To have one that actually works and to such deadly effect is certainly a disturbing feature of this particular attack,\" Pantucci commented.\nAnalysts from Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre (JTIC) referred to hospital staff in Manchester saying that they were treating people for shrapnel wounds, which, according to the note's authors indicated \"the likely use of an improvised explosive device (IED) filled with nails, ball bearings, or other metal.\"\nThe attack took place within one of the U.K.'s largest cities which is located in the country's north and counts a population of over half a million people. Ian Hopkins, chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police, said Tuesday that police believe the attack was carried out by one man who had an improvised explosive device and who also died in the bombing.\nThe British Transport Police has also revealed that the explosion occurred in the foyer area of the Manchester Area, which JTIC analysts suggest illustrates the vulnerability of mass gatherings such as Monday evening's concert which had hosted 21,000 attendees and has overtones of other recent tragic attacks.\n\"Though no claim has been made, the attack fits with the targeting patterns of the Islamist militant groups, with concert venues and clubs targeted previously: For instance in the Islamic State's attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, France, on 13 November 2015 which killed 89 people, or the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, which killed 49 people,\" the JTIC note added.\nWhile it is more common for terror attacks to take place in capital cities in order to maximize the effect of the political message delivered, it is not abnormal for major cities outside of London to be the target of terrorists, according to Pantucci.\nHe flagged a large Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb attack in the late 1990s in Manchester and foiled al-Qaeda plots both there and in Liverpool as examples, adding that domestic security services have recognized this and spread out their coverage areas.\nFollowing the terror attack outside London's Westminster Parliament in March 2017 which saw an attacker drive into pedestrians, resulting in four fatalities and more than 50 injured persons, security services began to ask themselves a lot of questions regarding the suff"}

On a more positive note for Patino, he hit 96 mph on the radar gun in the first inning and got a lot of soft contact.\nPatino was much more impressive in the second inning, striking out two on hard-breaking curveballs. His fastball remained at 96, while his curveball broke in at 78 mph, keeping Whitecaps hitters off balance. He also showed some variation in his delivery, doing an extra leg waggle every few pitches to change the tempo.\nIn the bottom of the second, the young pitcher got some help from the Fort Wayne offense. Luis Almanzar led off with a walk and reached second on a ground ball back to the pitcher. Gabriel Arias hit next and grounded hard up the middle. Shortstop Cole Peterson got to it and tried to throw Arias out, but the throw sailed into the Fort Wayne dugout, letting Almanzar trot home from second and knot the score at 1-1.\nThe TinCaps struck again in the third, this time without the help of any miscues. Esteury Ruiz singled to lead off the inning and then stole second on slow-delivering Whitecaps pitcher Matt Manning. Manning hit Carlos Belen and Luis Almanzar followed with a soft single to center, driving in Ruiz from second with the go-ahead run. Two batters later, Arias lined down the right-field line for a double. The ball was barely fair, landing directly on the line, but it was enough to drive in Belen and put Fort Wayne ahead 3-1.\nPatino cruised through the middle innings, but in the sixth he began to falter. An infield hit put a runner on first and prevented first baseman Carlos Belen from getting to a chopper from the next batter that sctooted through the right side for another hit. Patino battled with Brady Policelli, but eventually walked him on nine pitches to load the bases with nobody out. That ended the starter's day after five-plus innings, with Ben Sheckler taking over. Sheckler was terrific, getting a double play ground ball and an easy grounder to short to end the threat. One run scored to make it 3-2, but the reliever averted more serious damage and kept his team in the lead.\nSheckler worked the seventh and eighth and right-hander Jared Carkuff handled the ninth. Carkuff retired the side without incident to pick up his second save.\nThe reliever pitched the TinCaps out of trouble in the sixth after coming in with the bases loaded and nobody out and wriggled out of a jam of his own making in the seventh with another double play. He worked three scoreless innings in all, giving up two hits and striking out two. He kept Fort Wayne in front after inheriting a 3-1 advantage.\nWhitecaps starter Matt Manning was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2016 draft and is the No. 51 prospect in baseball per MLB.com."}

There\u2019s something about the mammalian brain that just likes the idea of being able to reach out and touch a digital objects \u2014 that is the point at which virtual worlds could become credible representations of the real world.\nStill, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures. Now, a Kickstarter called Nimble Sense hopes to change that by using Kinect-like depth perception to track and render your hands without any hand-borne hardware at all.\nNimble Sense is basically a tiny Kinect sensor that affixes to the front of your VR headset of choice. The Kinect does a bit of hand- and even finger-tracking itself of course, but since its mission is so much more general it can\u2019t give you the sort of fine hand control you would need for detailed work in VR. Nimble Sense, however, can make certain assumptions about the type of input it will have to process, basically disregarding any info that doesn\u2019t come from within a narrow spectrum of distance from, and angle to, the time-of-flight sensors. With such a simple mission, Nimble Sense seems to be able to follow finger movement with enough fidelity to let you thread a digital needle.\nNimble claims the product is revolutionary for its price, but at $99 for the base model is only about $20 cheaper than a new Kinect these days. Frankly, $100+ dollars seems a bit much for a peripheral of a peripheral, but the real potential could be in adoption by the big VR manufacturers. The team heavily favors the Oculus as its best-tested model but claims Nimble Sense can work with a wider array of VR headsets \u2014 which basically means Sony\u2019s VR headset. It\u2019s entirely possible that one of these two will buy up the technology and basically force their competition to develop a countermeasure for inclusion in the base VR model. In this way, the best outcome for consumers might be if Nimble Sense sold to Valve, which has an interest in pushing VR forward for the industry as a whole.\nThe Nimble Sense camera covers 110 degrees centered in the middle of the headset, meaning it covers an area about 10 degrees wider than the Oculus seems to render in its screens \u2014 so you can touch things all the way out to your peripheral vision. You still couldn\u2019t reach behind you to grab an object you know ought to be there in the digital world, but for that we would need a more Kinect-like third person solution, probably in addition to a Nimble Sense-like first person hand tracker. The low latency provided by the close-up, narrow-focus camera would be very difficult to provide otherwise \u2014 though there\u2019s no word about just how resource-intensive such hand tracking will be on your gaming PC.\nThere is, of course, more to a device like this than the hardware alone. Tracking and rendering hands is great, but give those hands a physical reality in the world, to the point that they can pick up and manipulate objects that were not made with this technology in mind, will require specific integration with a particular engine or even particular games \u2014 and that means support.

Buffalo hockey fans conditioned themselves into thinking a hard-working team mattered most, which was their way of taking comfort knowing the effort was there when the talent was not.\nThe Sabres are immensely skilled and have been scoring at a furious pace since the Olympic break, but we should appreciate how often those pretty plays began rather than gush over where they ended. Take a step back and see how good Toni Lydman and Henrik Tallinder have been this season.\nOK, stop yawning. Nobody goes to the Hall of Fame for making effective breakout passes, but they skated into the weekend tied for the team lead with a rating of plus-18. Less than a handful of NHL teams had two defensemen with a better plus-minus than their combined plus-36. No pair was as anonymous as the two Sabres.\n\"Sometimes, you just find that chemistry with some guys,\" Tallinder said. \"I think that's what's going on with me and Toni. He's an easygoing guy. He never blinks. He never stresses up. It makes it easy for me. The chemistry is just there.\"\nMaxim Afinogenov with the puck is a rock concert compared to Lydman and Tallinder's subtle, symphonic style. But they've turned simple passing into an art form while quietly becoming one of the NHL's top duos.\nTallinder is from Sweden, the supposed big brother to Lydman's Finland. Banter between the countries, if not 125 years of animosity, is constant. How many Finns does it take to change a light bulb? Five, one to hold the bulb and four to drink the vodka until the room starts spinning. How do you know you've been in Sweden too long? When your bad mood becomes your good mood.\n\"We don't really like each other,\" Tallinder joked.\nTallinder thought about firing away at Lydman after Sweden beat Finland for Olympic gold last month but changed his mind. Don't tell anybody, but he kinda likes his defense partner and, um, he didn't want to hurt his feelings.\n\"He's trying really hard,\" Lydman said with a laugh. \"You know, he did move to Finland.\"\nTallinder and Lydman can jab each other all day, but there's no disputing their kinship on the ice. Both grew up playing the Scandinavian style, which emphasizes skating and puckhandling. They aren't overly aggressive. They're rarely out of position. They're suited for one another, suited for today's NHL.\n\"In Sweden and Finland, you're not playing if you can't pass or handle the puck,\" Lydman said. \"Everybody knows what to do with the puck. If a forward is forechecking hard and trying to make hits, he usually looks like a fool running after two guys who are passing the puck to each other.\"\nPerhaps most impressive about their success this season is that they've done it without putting up big numbers themselves. Entering Saturday, Lydman and Tallinder had combined for just six goals and 30 points. Detroit, Dallas, the Rangers and Ottawa -- the four teams with two defensemen combining for a higher plus-minus -- each had offensive defensemen that helped pad their ratings.\nA week and a half ago, the Sabres surrendered 10 goals to Tampa Bay and Philadelphia, but the two defensemen still were a combined plus-5"}

And some of those sources may not follow the safest, cleanest procedures.\nAbout 94 percent of American shrimp is imported, the magazine says. And most of that shrimp is grown in farms \u2014 huge man-made tanks into which shrimp are densely packed and fed foods that may be laced with antibiotics. That can lead to unsanitary conditions if farmers aren\u2019t careful. Consumer Reports adds that labels are rarely of much help; sellers may not even know from where their shrimp came, and the more expensive stuff isn\u2019t necessarily better.\nWild shrimp is far less likely to have harmful bacteria than farmed, Consumer Reports says. If you do buy farmed shrimp, it recommends looking for shrimp labeled Naturland, Aquaculture Stewardship Council or Whole Foods Market Responsibly Farmed \u2014 they\u2019re far less likely to have antibiotics. The magazine\u2019s testing didn\u2019t find a whole lot of difference in taste between wild and farmed shrimp, though.\nFresh vs. frozen? No contest: The only really fresh shrimp you\u2019ll find is at a gourmet seafood market or a seaside store, Consumer Reports says. All other shrimp sold as \u201cfresh\u201d was frozen at some point, so don\u2019t bother paying the extra money.\nPrecooked shrimp may be convenient, but the magazine found bacteria in a few cooked samples. Buy the shrimp raw and cook it yourself \u2014 that should kill any bacteria.\nWild shrimp is the best choice for shrimp without antibiotics or bacteria, but then again wild shrimp farming has an environmental impact. If you go wild, Consumer Report says, look for shrimp certified by the Marine Stewardship Council; shrimp from Whole Foods Market; and those listed as \u201cBest Choices\u201d or \u201cGood Alternatives\u201d on seafoodwatch.org.\nBeware of \u201cseafood fraud,\u201d the magazine says.

A clean tract may be less gross, but that means a farmer stopped feeding the shrimp before the harvest.\nIn its investigation, Consumer Reports tested raw shrimp for bacterial contamination, specifically for vibrio, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, listeria or salmonella.

Several theories abound about the source of the gas, also known as methane. The gas of this natural gasfield is believed to derive from abiogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons associated with ancient fissure waters, coal beds or ancient algal mats, according to research conducted by geologists.\nRegardless of the source or genesis, the methane gas is clearly located along major and minor faults.\nAnother key belief is that the asteroid impact in the Witwatersrand basin about 2-billion years ago, which formed the Vredefort Dome, in the Free State, assisted in bringing uranium and thorium into the basin. Helium is believed to have been derived from the natural radioactive decay of these heavy radioactive elements.\nThe naturally occurring methane acts as a carrier to bring the helium to the surface, resulting in gas concentrations of between 3% and 4%, at levels as shallow as 400 m, and well above some of the gold mining operations in the area.\nThe natural gas of the Welkom goldfield was first discovered in the Virginia gold mine in 1947 and the mine has been emitting combustible gas ever since, according to professional services firm Venmyn Deloitte.\n\u201cThis natural gas, with affiliated helium, has since been recorded as being emitted by surface drillholes . . . faults and cracks in all the underground mines of the goldfield,\u201d the company notes.\nBased on additional anecdotal reports, gas intersections were first made when miners explored for gold on the Free State portion of the Witwatersrand basin. The drilling of cores led to additional discoveries of natural gas, with a hit ratio in terms of drilling for gold and striking gas being significantly high.\nOnce the gold shafts were established and mining operations undertaken, historical evidence indicates that the Welkom goldfield had mines that were classified as fiery \u2013 mines that have traces of methane and had explosions in the past.\n\u201cGas has accumulated and found its way through the faults and fissures; we have also come across puddles of water containing methane gas in the area that have been ignited in the past,\u201d adds Renergen COO Nick Mitchell.\nHighlighting the relevance of helium, geologist PJ Hugo and the then South African the Atomic Energy Board disseminated scientific papers in the early 1960s, including the \u2018Helium in the Orange Free State goldfield \u2013 a nuclear raw materials investigation primarily for the Atomic Energy Board\u2019, published in 1963.\nHugo\u2019s other publication, \u2018The Evander gas-field\u2019, published in the Bulletin Geological Survey of South Africa in 1964, also includes suggestions that the methane which occurs in the Witwatersrand strata is believed to have been derived from distillation of coal or carbonaceous shale by intrusion of dolerite.\nWhile there was no historical exploration for gas in the area, exploration"}

You have to wear the beanie so loosely that it seems like it\u2019s about to fall off every time you turn your head. This exudes the nonchalance that hipsters work so strenuously to achieve.\nTo prove that you were interested in things before they were popular, it\u2019s always a good idea to sport ironic tops that depict superheroes, characters from children\u2019s TV shows (a.k.a. Dora the Explorer), breakfast cereal mascots, moustaches or obscure bands like Two Door Cinema Club or The Steelwells. Floral patterns or forestry images are also appropriate and particularly striking when in an industrial area. Make sure not to wear ironic subjects that are too overdone, though, such as The Flash and Che Guevara.\nFor those of us fortunate enough to have horrible vision, get prescription glasses that look exactly like clubmasters or wayfarers. Their coolness and unique shape guarantee a good look for every face type, and the glasses themselves connote someone from high society with their thick frames and little metallic end dimples.

Converse All-Stars or old-school Vans are the best, specifically the oldest, dirtiest and grimiest pair you can find. Wash your shoes every week to keep them indecent, but not too indecent. Remember, hipsters have to walk that fine line of looking poor and vintage, despite their opulent upbringing. Checkered or outrageously colored ones are great patterns, or if you want to look even more low-income, just paint them yourself!

At 3:40 p.m., shares were down nearly 24% from the previous close.\nLet's dig into the results to see how the company performed in the three areas that I suggested investors should pay attention to.\nInfinera's top line grew 31% and landed smack in the middle of management's guidance range of $240 million to $250 million. Earnings grew a strong 19% during the period and came in at $0.19, which was ahead of the company's $0.17 forecast.\nManagement believes that the rapid adoption of 4K video and cloud computing are driving an enormous increase in consumer demand for bandwidth, which in turn is forcing service providers to invest heavily in their networks to keep up. That's greatly increasing the demand for Infinera's equipment and is a major reason the company continues to grow quickly.\nThat fast growth rate also suggests that Infinera continues to gobble up market share from players like Ciena (NYSE:CIEN). For perspective, analysts are projecting that Ciena's revenue will grow by 1% in the coming quarter and by slightly more than 6% for the full year.\nInfinera showed a strong non-GAAP gross margin of 50.2% for the period, which is well ahead of the 47.8% it reported in the year-ago quarter. That result also exceeded the high end of management's guidance range and it is the first time that the company has produced a gross margin above its long-term target of 50%.\nA higher-than-expected gross margin allowed the company to post a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.3%, up slightly from 12.2% last year. That's a solid result, especially when you consider that management warned that quarterly profit growth would suffer this quarter as it continued to invest heavily in its growth.\nWhile 50% gross margin in Q1 was a fantastic result, Q1 tends to be a stronger margin quarter as a result of the mix of revenues. While it will take some time for us to go to a point where we can generate margins of this level on a consistent basis, we are confident that the combination of our operating model and the underlying strength of our business will enable us to consistently achieve 50% gross margins in the not-too-distant future.\nIs the integration work complete yet?\nOn its conference call, management reaffirmed that the Transmode integration work remains on track and that consumers are responding positively to its ability to now offer a suite of product solutions.\nHowever, management did state that a \"significant\" Transmode customer has not purchased any products from the company in two quarters. While it believes that the relationship remains healthy, management admitted that it is having a tough time making up for the revenue shortfall with this customer sitting on the sidelines.\nWhile the overall report looked solid, Wall Street was less than thrilled to hear management's guidance for the second quarter. The company is forecasting that revenue will land within $5 million of $255 million, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. That's quite a bit"}

{"idx": "9613", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: It\u2019s likely that versions of this query still run through the president\u2019s mind \u2014 and that he often finds himself coming up short, despite his public bravado and the loopy, ill-informed self-assurance he displays during pivotal moments such as his national emergency speech in the Rose Garden. That explains why he constantly spins his narratives toward success even in the face of obvious failures. To admit defeat is to admit he\u2019s not walking the walk.\nTo that end, the White House released a document on Friday titled \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Border Security Victory\u201d a day after Congress passed a spending bill that didn\u2019t fund the border wall Trump demanded. The memo described the bill as a \u201clegislative win\u201d for Trump and outlined his intention to take executive action (and end-run Congress and the Constitution) by raising funds for the wall unilaterally.\nIt was inevitable that Trump would refuse to be stymied by Congress, and that he would take a victory lap regardless of what happened in the real world. In that context, his border-wall machinations are only partially about appeasing conservative pundits or his political base; for the most part, they\u2019re about appeasing his sense of himself. He\u2019s been doing this sort of thing his entire life: Spinning victory yarns from incontrovertible losses was a hallmark of his troubled business career.\nWarren Buffett, who actually is one of the smartest people in the country, made fun of Trump\u2019s business failures during a film and a live skit he performed in at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting in 2005. An actor played a sobbing Trump, distraught over bad headlines about his bankruptcy, and he was gently consoled on stage by a sympathetic Buffett \u2014 until Buffett realized that someone as self-made and successful as he is actually has nothing in common with Trump, and the skit ended.\nThis kind of stuff can be found even further back. In 1983, Trump bought into the nascent United States Football League. Although the USFL was trying to avoid a head-on confrontation with the National Football League by playing in the spring and was trying to keep a cap on salaries to keep its budgets reasonable, Trump pushed the league into fall play, began tossing out lavish salaries, and spearheaded an unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. The USFL, and Trump\u2019s franchise, the New Jersey Generals, collapsed in 1986.\nTrump blamed his fellow USFL owners for the debacle rather than acknowledging any of his own missteps, in much the same way he has blamed others in the GOP for his lack of border wall funding. He also was indifferent (then as now) to the impact his fumbling had on those around him.\nIn a similar fiasco, Trump overpaid for the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle in 1989, using borrowed money and bringing no previous experience running an airline to the deal. He rechristened it the Trump Shuttle and then proceeded to make a number of operational errors, including installing gold-plated fixtures and other private-jet features that made little sense for a no-frills airline. Trump lied in one of his books, 1990\u2019s \u201cTrump: Surviving at the Top,\u201d that the Shuttle under his management was profitable. \u201cI\u2019m glad I saved it. I\u2019m proud of the way it\u2019s been improved. It is now the best,\u201d he also wrote.\nThe Trump Shuttle went bankrupt in 199"}

But at the official kick off of the Obama campaign at Ohio State yesterday, the arena where the event was held looked about half full.\nBarack Obama launched his campaign in unspectacular fashion today at Ohio State University, the largest college in the crucial swing state. A photo posted to twitter by Mitt Romney's campaign spokesman Ryan Williams reveals sparse attendance. The above image, according to Williams, was taken during the President's first official campaign speech.\nDuring the speech, Obama ripped into the presumptive GOP nominee and discussed nation building at home, but the most newsworthy item of the day was not the talking points Obama delivered: it was the crowd... or lack thereof. According to ABC News, the Obama campaign had expected an \"overflow\" of people. Instead, the arena looked half-empty. The Columbus Dispatch reports that Obama organizers even had people move from the seats to the floor of the gym in order to project a larger crowd on television.\nIt's a campaign faux pas to hold an event in a room that isn't full; to promise the media a more-than-capacity crowd then fall this far short of that promise is utter incompetence. In 2008, Obama ran a near-flawless campaign, buoyed by enthusiasm and effective organizing. But it's not 2008 any more, and on day one of the 2012 campaign, Team Obama has already made an embarrassing blunder.\nThis may be significant - and it may not be.

If he can't get 20,000 people to show up at his kick off rally in a college town, that doesn't speak well for the enthusiasm of the young that helped propel him to victory in 2008.\nAt any rate, it was indeed, an embarrassment that most media outfits expertly covered up.

It now goes to the full House for consideration.\nThe sponsor, Rep. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, said she was inspired by delivery services she saw during a legislative conference last year in Boston.\nShe researched companies that provide such services in the U.S. and the handful of states that have passed legislation to allow it before crafting her own proposal.\n\"My opinion is that if you allow these machines and there is no regulation whatsoever, there is a potential for hazards with pedestrians on the streets, cars,\" Townsend said.\nThe bill allows \"personal delivery device operators\" to operate on sidewalks and crosswalks, and gives the devices, or robots, the same \"rights and duties\" as pedestrians.\nThose rights mean the devices would be protected from drivers who hit them in crosswalks. The duties would mean they have to abide by traffic laws when crossing streets.\nThe bill also requires the operators to maintain at least $100,000 in liability insurance, and exempts the robots from motor-vehicle registration and insurance laws. Violators of the rules could face $500 fines.\nOne such robot owned by an Estonian company called Starship Technologies was at the Capitol for a demonstration.

Hence, we believe that the execution of the five-year business plan will be the key for further upside into Ferrari as it improves its margin profile and move closer or higher than its luxury peer, Hermes.\nThe upward trajectory at the EBITDA level continues, which will be the case going forward as confirmed by the Ferrari management guidance for 2019.\nCamilleri shares increased by +380% from his previous holding of 3,526 shares to 13,526 shares following the successful Spinoff on January 3, 2016, and has helped restore faith that the company is pushing ahead with growth plans.\nHe will move forward with predecessor Marchionne\u2019s hopes to introduce a new gasoline-battery hybrid after testing at the company's track near Maranello, Italy.\nOn December 28, 2018, RACE announced to commencement of its first tranche of \u20ac150m share buyback as part of"}

For three real estate heavyweights, it\u2019s just getting started.\nBoutique investment bank Westwood Capital, veteran apartment building owner and manager Gerald Guterman, and appraiser Jonathan Miller plan to buy $1 billion worth of new condominium buildings from struggling banks and convert them into rental apartments.\nThe venture, Condominium Recovery LLC, would buy whole buildings or large swaths of 50, 100 or 200 units at a time from banks that soon may be forced foreclose on billions of dollars in loans they made to developers.\nIts team plans to start buying in New York City and south Florida. In both places, the financial crisis and recession shuttered construction projects in what were among the hottest U.S. real estate markets.\nCondominium Recovery is trying something that few other investors have because there has rarely been such a glut of property hitting the market during such depressed conditions.\nThe boom of the past decade grew out of low interest rates that made loans easy to get. Abundant low-interest loans boosted condominium prices to the tune of an average of $1.5 million to $2 million for a New York condominium.\n\u201cIf you look at the window of the expansion of condominium development, it correlates with the credit boom, and now we\u2019re past that,\u201d Miller said.\nNow banks are in a tough spot. Not only did they bankroll the developers, they lent them interest reserves \u2014 money to cover the interest payments.\nBanks are reluctant to foreclose on loans and get property instead because it means that they have to book the loans as a loss and take a hit to their already wobbly bottom lines.\n\u201cVacant condo project lenders are downright ostrich-like in the face of an unmitigated disaster,\u201d Daniel Alpert, managing Partner of Westwood Capital, said in a recent interview, referring to the widespread practice of banks extending loans instead of foreclosing on commercial real estate properties.\nGuterman says banks would be better off selling their buildings to his group at a price that would support apartment investment, as opposed to the typically higher condo prices.\nWhy? It\u2019s better for the banks to take a smaller loss and shed the property \u2014 with all its possible problems, such as litigation and more construction \u2014 than to take a bigger loss and keep it.\n\u201cThe whole question is, especially after all of the reserves are gone, do you take the unlimited liability and run with it, or do you deal with someone who has credibility and has the funds, and sell it to them on a reasonable basis, which today is a rental basis?\u201d Guterman said.\nIt is a convincing argument when you consider the source. Guterman, whom many real estate experts consider a master of he business, has owned or managed more than 60,000 apartments in the last 41 years.\nThen there is Miller\u2019s authority in residential appraisals. His quarterly reports on the New York City-area market is considered required reading among real estate professionals.\nThere is no shortage of inventory. In Manhattan alone, about 6,500 condo units completed or near completion but have not been listed for sale. Add to that new listings on the market, and that figure jumps to 8,500.\nIn New York City there are about 22,000 condos completed or near completion, but not listed for sale. That\u2019s more than 26,000, counting new units on the market"}

{"idx": "9630", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: They're the unsung heroes of Hollywood, those whose job it is to stop your heart, steal your breath and leave you gasping for more \u2013 and the chances are, you've barely given their work a second thought. For this is the world of trailer music: an industry few people know exists, producing scores heard every day by millions.\n\"People just assume that the music in the trailer is from the film,\" says the veteran TV and film composer John Beal, talking from his LA home. \"That was the case a long time ago, although the music was taken from other films instead. Back when I started, only the occasional trailer was actually scored. The process has changed a lot since then.\"\nHe should know. Beal was the first of his kind: a composer creating original scores for film trailers. \"I realised the trailer was not being served as well as the picture was,\" he says. In 1979, he was given the chance to put that right, when he scored the trailer for Skatetown, USA, Patrick Swayze's debut. Since then, Beal has been the man behind the music for more than 2,000 trailers \u2013 scoring everything from The Matrix to Mean Girls. \"After 30 years of doing this, the soundtrack in my head as I'm doing the groceries is a lot more dramatic than other people's,\" he says. \"I live in a constant state of hyperbole.\"\nIt's easy to see why. The art of scoring a trailer requires not only a certain style of thinking, but an entirely different approach to composition. Trailer scores are commissioned by production companies via \"trailer houses\", which produce the final edit. They typically last two minutes and are split into three parts: beginning, middle and end, usually all containing different pieces and styles of music. The goal is to produce a heavily briefed, tightly wound and meticulously edited piece of work in which every second counts. \"To write something that develops so fully and extremely in two minutes,\" Beal says, \"is something a lot of composers, including guys who are way better than I am when it comes to long-form film scores, just can't do.\"\nEven so, times have changed. Production companies are no longer keen to commission original pieces for trailers, preferring instead to opt for music that they know has worked for other movies. Says Beal: \"The brief I usually get these days is, 'As little as possible in terms of budget, as big a sound as possible, and just like something that somebody else did but different enough to not get us sued.' Mostly I'll be asked to emulate composers such as John Williams, James Horner's Aliens or to do something with the same epic feel of Carmina Burana.\" Of course, the issue of production companies trying to dodge licensing fees for non-original music \u2013 which can go as high as $75,000 \u2013 creates problems for composers told to all but recreate that music. \"There's only so many different versions of something you can do,\" Beal says.\nIn a way, the fall in demand for originality is understandable: on projects worth millions of dollars, why take a risk on something new that might not work? Then again, it could be seen as a snapshot of a wider picture: of a conservative, corporate culture that has seeped into every crevice of the Hollywood machine \u2013 the same culture that insists on endless sequels and remakes. \"A lot of head of studios have come from marketing,\" Beal says. \"Executives who don't really understand the art of film-making, but understand the art of film selling.\"\nIt is perhaps"}

Oh, you\u2019re INFP? You present your personality through distinctive actions and words cultivated through a lifetime of experiences? That\u2019s nice, but how can four idiot letters compete with the outstanding writing and multifaceted characters of my favorite TV show, which I now embody and exert most of my energy talking about?\nSorry, you probably didn\u2019t get that \u201cLick my filthy buttered buns, Grandma!\u201d is a classic line from an episode of my favorite show, every single episode of which I have watched multiple times.

That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Anyone can watch an episode of my favorite show. But did you understand the nuance of its sophisticated humor? Did you catch all the foreshadowing? What about the callbacks to the previous episodes? Yeah, I bet not. There are a lot of highbrow elements in the show, which you probably need multiple degrees to understand. Or you could just happen to be very smart and have had an invasive medical procedure, like me.\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m better than other people since my operation, because that goes without saying. You are mere mortals. I am the golden age of TV incarnate! Bow before my complex methods of storytelling and creative subversion of tropes.\nStill, having my favorite TV show inserted in place of my personality hasn\u2019t been without its side effects. While my A story has been one of triumph, my B story has been rife with challenges. One time, the A.V. Club gave what it deemed an \u201cuninspired\u201d episode of my TV show a C+ rating. That stung. I didn\u2019t leave my room for days.

{"idx": "9633", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Call it a selfie stick on steroids or just a less technical way to get great aerial shots. Either way, the Fotokite Phi is a camera tool that may have arrived just on time.\nInstead of forcing you to learn how to fly a camera-mounted drone, the Fotokite Phi tethers the flying device to you via a leash, eliminating sometimes unwieldy software controls and shaky, newbie piloting from the aerial-image-capturing equation.\nThe makers of the Fotokite Phi call it a \"no-frills aerial camera,\" and that's exactly what it is. It means you can take better photos, but there are limitations.\nFirst, the lightweight (only 300 grams) quadcopter does not include a camera. You'll have to provide your own GoPro camera, the device the rig is optimized for. Next, it's important to note that the Fotokite Phi doesn't rely on GPS. It works by recognizing the tether tension as a positioning guide, as well as your manipulation of the tether when it's time to adjust the device's viewing angle.\nFotokite Phi's tether is 26 feet long, which is enough to allow you to take stunning aerial photos, but not enough to capture the kind of comprehensive aerial scouting videos that have become common from drone users. However, the upside with the Fotokite Phi is that you don't have to worry about losing control of your expensive drone and having it end up in the water or shattered to pieces on the ground because some bystander decided to play with it.\nAnd that's no small consideration. As popular as amateur drones have become, stories of losing one to damage as a new user are pretty common. With drone prices ranging from $400 to $1,000, it's not like you're just experimenting with easily replaceable sports equipment \u2014 it can get expensive.\nIn that respect, price may be another one of the advantages of the Fotokite Phi. Despite its no-frills approach, its creators estimate that the retail price will be about $500, which, when you consider the low risk of damaging or losing the device (compared to drones), seems relatively reasonable. Another great feature is that the device can be folded up and stored in a portable canister.\nPerhaps the only discernable downside to the Fotokite Phi is its flight time: just 10 minutes. That's about enough time to capture a well-researched shot you're looking for, but at a concert or sporting event, that time limit will be a hassle. Luckily, the device can be charged either by USB or via removable batteries (eliminating the need to go find an electrical outlet to continue flying and shooting). Nevertheless, the flight time limit may be too short for some.\nGoPro plans to release its own camera drone sometime in 2016. And while we don't know what GoPro's drone will look like, it looks like the Fotokite Phi could point the way toward the best implementation of a mainstream, danger-free (its blades are soft to the touch) and less costly way to enhance the powers of your GoPro.\nThe device is available for preorder at lower prices on the company's IndieGogo campaign page, which has already raised about $45,000 of its $300,000.

In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin.\nIn 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers \u2014 media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament \u2014 under his authority. He called it \u201ca vertical of power.\u201d This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals. Today the top management of these enterprises are Putin allies, and many, like Mr. Putin himself, have worked in the security services, specifically in the K.G.B. and its successor organization, the F.S.B.\nThe Russian government owns the major television outlets and, according to Russian journalists, sets the daily news agenda. The head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, is Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. and F.S.B. security officer who served as a top lieutenant to Mr. Putin. Gazprom, the state gas company, is run by Alexei Miller, another former St. Petersburg associate of Mr. Putin. With exclusive rights to export gas, Gazprom controls prices, pipelines and energy diplomacy in Russia. It also owns the country\u2019s largest media holding company, Gazprom Media.\nThe deal Mr. Putin made with these companies, oligarchs and banks was that they would be free to make money with state help (often to the detriment of the Russian people) as long as Mr. Putin and his cronies got their cut of the profits \u2014 and the Kremlin and security forces were free to govern without interference. Failure to comply could lead to loss of one\u2019s company or worse: The oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky challenged Mr. Putin on corruption in 2003 and was stripped of his company and put in jail. Oligarchs once close to Mr. Putin have died under suspicious circumstances.\nThere was one more part of this arrangement: Since the government facilitated the moneymaking, the Kremlin could also demand in return payments or loans to favored individuals and institutions \u2014 no questions asked.\nAll this is important to understand when considering the case of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. According to news reports, Mr. Kushner held a secret meeting with the chief executive of a Russian bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, in December, before the Trump administration took office. The purpose of the meeting remains unclear. Was it related to some diplomatic issue, as the White House has suggested? Or was it about Trump or Kushner family enterprises? It is possible the meeting was entirely legal (although actually doing business with the bank would not have been). Because of the nature of Russian banks, either scenario raises troubling questions.\nIn the case of the major Russian state banks, their lending decisions are often politically directed, and when capital is tight \u2014 such as after the 2008 recession or the 2014 imposition of sanctions by the United States and the European Union on banks for supporting Moscow\u2019s military adventurism in Crimea and eastern Ukraine \u2014 the Russian government has provided cash infusions from the state treasury.\nThe bank executive Mr. Kushner met with last December, Sergey Gorkov, is a graduate of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service academy.

Trump has been publicly criticizing the Fed since July for interest-rate increases and declared he was \u201cnot happy\u201d in September when the central bank raised rates for the third time this year.\nTrump, who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as an affirmation of his economic policies, downplayed the significance of the market drop even as he pointed the finger at the Fed.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good,\u201d Trump said of the stock decline. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for for a long time.

The IMF projections don\u2019t take into account Trump\u2019s threat to expand the tariffs to effectively all of the more than $500 billion in goods the U.S. bought from China last year.\nTrump\u2019s public criticism of the Federal Reserve, whose chairman, Jerome Powell, Trump appointed, is a sharp departure from his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution\u2019s independence.\nFed spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks.\nPowell\u2019s goal is to extend the second-longest U.S. economic expansion on record by moving interest rates up just quickly enough to prevent overheating, but not so rapidly that the central bank chokes off growth. Powell said last week he expects to stick with the current path of gradual interest-rate hikes while monitoring risks in the economy.\nOne reason why the Fed has been raising interest rates even with little sign of an inflation breakout is because the unemployment rate, which fell to 3.7 percent in September, is at a level that many officials expect will cause wage and price gains to accelerate over time.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement following the close of markets that the U.S. economy is \u201cincredibly strong\u201d despite the sell-off.\nDuring an event earlier Wednesday amid the sell-off, Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said they believed the American economy was robust. \u201cIt is doing well,\u201d Trump said.\nPresident Donald Trump again criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates following the worst market sell-off since February."}

However, the economic situation has pushed Gazans to abandon books and libraries.\nAbu Zaida added that in the event the economic situation improves and financial incentives for writers and readers alike are made available through cultural, intellectual and literary competitions, the percentage of readers would increase. \u201cThis phenomenon is not a reading halt, but it is the consequence of circumstances that we hope are temporary and can be overcome,\u201d he said.\nIts manager, Hatem al-Yazigi, noted that in 1974, the store traded in stationery, textbooks and office supplies. However, 10 years later, it turned to importing and printing cultural and university books as well as novels. Currently, the shop has around 15,000 books.\nCompared to the first three decades of the shop\u2019s life, book sales have decreased. Yazigi blamed this decline on several factors that shut its second branch in central Gaza down.\n\u201cLately, the situation has grown worse, and we can say that there is little demand for books. Only some organizations support the reading culture and buying books. They mainly focus on children\u2019s books, literature and novels. Meanwhile, our participation in book exhibitions abroad has been effective, because there is a high turnout by the inhabitants of the countries we visit,\u201d he said.\nOnly university students and teachers, in addition to some intellectuals and poets, seem to be buying books. Although there are not many, they search for low-cost books. For that reason, many street vendors sell books in front of Gaza\u2019s universities.\n\u201cCompared to bookshop prices, ours are lower, but book readers are rare. Four days might go by without us selling even one book,\u201d he noted.\nThe decline in Gaza\u2019s readers threatens the major libraries in the Gaza Strip, and their shutting down or limiting their role to selling schoolbooks threatens to affect the cultural scene.\nOn that note, the general manager of exhibitions and libraries at the Ministry of Culture in Gaza, Mohammad al-Sharif, noted that there are over 13 public libraries across the Gaza Strip, and around 10 active university libraries that cater to the needs of university students.\n\u201cPrivate libraries do not exceed 10, and they are owned by institutions. There are four main commercial libraries that import books from abroad and distribute them to library branches. The owners of these libraries participate in book exhibitions in Arab"}

Me, I had a mom belly. Clearly plump. Zero definition. Stretch marks ran along my sides, deep and dark, altering the color and texture of my skin forever. If you put a picture of my belly next to that \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d poster you\u2019d think you were looking at bodies from different universes. Whatever universe my body snuck out of, I wanted to beam it back.\n\u201cUgh, I feel fat,\u201d my mom frequently complained. She taught me just how complicated and uncomfortable \u201cfat\u201d can be. I learned it the same way first words are learned, not from explanation but from context and repetition. I wonder how many times she had to complain in front of a mirror, or while squeezing into her jeans, for me to understand all the subtleties of feeling fat.\nIf you feel full, you feel fat.

{"idx": "9649", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Every two weeks, Big Issues focuses on a newly released comic book of significance. This week, it\u2019s Zegas, a graphic novel by Michel Fiffe (COPRA, All-New Ultimates) that pairs ambitious, unorthodox visuals with intimate character storytelling.\nComics are a two-dimensional medium, but within a page\u2019s vertical and horizontal confines is a three-dimensional space that can be manipulated by visual storytellers. Not the depth within individual images, but the space surrounding the panels, which can have multiple planes depending on how those panels are arranged. Michel Fiffe is a cartoonist committed to exploring this aspect of the page, constantly finding innovative ways to depict visual information. The new Fantagraphics graphic novel, Zegas, collects comics originally self-published by Fiffe from 2009-2012, and these short stories about siblings Boston and Emily Zegas show Fiffe discovering new narrative possibilities telling grounded, character-driven stories with a boundary-pushing point of view.\nFiffe uses Boston and Emily to explore the challenges of the artist\u2019s lifestyle\u2014both emotional and financial\u2014and even if these characters don\u2019t explicitly reflect his views, there\u2019s an undeniable personal connection when an artist is addressing art in their work. It\u2019s also something younger artists tend to struggle with as they discover the reality of their industry, and Zegas feels like an early work for Fiffe. But that doesn\u2019t make it lesser. The work here is still very refined compared to the vast majority of comics out there, and there\u2019s a lot of passion and excitement in these pages. Fiffe\u2019s not set in one specific mode, but exploring the vast creative opportunities of both the medium and his concept. The major fun of Zegas is seeing Fiffe try out new techniques, not just with structure, but with linework and coloring. There\u2019s a real sense of discovery here, and Fiffe\u2019s impulses often lead to insights. Much of the color in Zegas comes from paint or colored pencils, but \u201cPlum\u201d is colored exclusively with screentones, highlighting how these patterns add texture to the artwork.\nThe first story, \u201cBirthday\u201d (previewed here), sets the bar very high for the rest of the book, establishing Emily and Boston\u2019s tense but loving relationship, the surreal surroundings, and Fiffe\u2019s unique way of approaching emotional, character-driven narratives. Fiffe makes the comic page feel like a three-dimensional space in how he layers panels and lettering, and small details have a big affect on this illusion. Emily throws an ice cube at her brother and it bounces off a cabinet, flying out of the panel and into the next, which doesn\u2019t have a border up top so it appears to be behind the first panel. (The lettering of the first panel also overlaps with the second, reinforcing that overlap.) Those three planes\u2014the house, Boston, and Emily, the ice cube\u2014add depth to the entire page, subtly telling the reader to start considering the layouts in three-dimension rather than two.\nI touched on this topic in my Big Issues on Santiago Garc\u00eda and David Rub\u00edn\u2019s Beowulf, which is much flashier with how it arranges panels to suggest a three-dimensional space. That added drama is appropriate given the legendary subject matter, but what makes Fiffe\u2019s layouts so remarkable is the subtlety and grace of the execution. At the bottom of the ice cube page, there\u2019s a three-panel sequence showing a lightning bolt shooting through the sky. It emerges from the corner of the first panel,"}

The average age of death was 45.2 years for North American stars and 39.6 for European ones.\nSolo performers had twice the death risk of members of bands. Lead researcher Mark Bellis speculated that could be because bands provide peer support at stressful times.\n\u201cSolo artists, even though they have huge followings, may be relatively isolated,\u201d said Bellis, director of the Center for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University.\nMusic critic John Aizlewood agreed that solo artists receive more attention and adulation \u2014 and also more pressure.\n\u201cAnd when you are a solo act, irrespective of what they say in interviews, it\u2019s an incredibly egotistical thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you tend to be dealing with people who are more emotionally extreme.\nIn good news for aging rockers, the study found that, after 25 years of fame, stars\u2019 death rates began to return to normal \u2014 at least in Europe. A European star still living 36 years after achieving fame faces a similar mortality rate to the European public. But U.S. artists continue to die in greater numbers.\nBellis said factors contributing to the difference could include longer careers \u2014 and thus longer exposure to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll excess \u2014 in the U.S., a huge, populous country with greater opportunities for aging stars to stay on the road. Europe\u2019s stronger social safety net and socialized medicine may also play a role, he said.\nThe research, which updates a 2007 study by the same team, was published in the online journal BMJ Open.\nThe study suggests the infamous rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle may not be entirely to blame for rock stars\u2019 death risk.\nThe researchers looked for the first time at the role of \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d \u2014 such as physical or sexual abuse \u2014 on stars\u2019 later behavior.\n\u201cSubstance abuse and risk-taking in stars are largely discussed in terms of hedonism, music industry culture, responses to the pressures of fame or even part of the creative process,\u201d the researchers said.\nBut Ellis Cashmore, a cultural studies professor at Staffordshire University and author of the book \u201cCelebrity/Culture,\u201d said it would be wrong to overlook \u201cartistic frustration\u201d as a factor in artistic self-destruction.\n\u201cPerhaps it is the continual striving for some sort of unattainable artistic perfection that drives them,\u201d he said."}

The actress Elisabeth Moss and the writer-director Alex Ross Perry previously collaborated on the independent dramas \"Listen Up Philip\" and \"Queen Of Earth.\" Their new movie, \"Her Smell,\" stars Moss as an out-of-control punk rock musician. Dan Stevens, Virginia Madsen and Cara Delevingne play characters who bear witness to her self-destructive behavior. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.\nJUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Between her superb performances on \"Mad Men,\" \"Top Of The Lake\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" Elisabeth Moss has been one of the best actors working in television for quite some time. Her excellent film work hasn't garnered as much attention, though, hopefully, that's about to change. She did steal a few scenes recently in Jordan Peele's hit horror picture, \"Us,\" and she gives her most arresting performance yet in her new movie, \"Her Smell,\" written and directed by her regular collaborator, Alex Ross Perry.\nThis is a brilliant but blistering film, and it might be too emotionally draining an experience to draw the audience it deserves. The nose-wrinkling title may not help, either. But you should see it for Moss' spectacular psychological meltdown of a performance as Becky Something, the lead singer and guitarist of an all-female punk rock band called Something She. Early on, we see a flashback to the group's '90s heyday, when Becky and her bandmates - well played by Agyness Deyn and Gayle Rankin - first landed on the cover of Spin magazine. But most of the movie unfolds much later, after fame, wealth and substance abuse have taken their toll, and Something She is now playing in smaller clubs rather than sold-out arenas. The story is divided into five acts, and while some of them are set months or even years apart, each one plays out unflinchingly in real time.\nThe first three acts are like the proverbial slow-motion train wreck, as Becky flails around backstage at grungy concert venues or in a recording studio verbally incinerating everyone in her midst. She lashes out at her bandmates, her manager and even her mother, who seems to be forever apologizing for having brought this monster into the world. She rips into her ex-boyfriend, played by Dan Stevens, with whom she has a daughter, and you can't help but fear for the poor child's safety whenever her mom picks her up and gives her a maniacal squeeze.\nEveryone takes Becky's abuse with varying degrees of tolerance, exasperation and justified anger. About halfway through the movie, her bandmates have had enough and walk out of the studio where they've been struggling to record a new album. Three up-and-coming rockers arrive to record in the same studio. And Becky, always ready to turn her defeat into victory, draws these star-struck young women into her orbit.\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We don't need to be here. I know we can give you your space. Like, this must not be super easy.\nELISABETH MOSS: (As Becky Something) Wrong. I am the heart and soul of this band. Well, hello, I named it after myself.

Another Stanford study says that too-generous public pensions are robbing core government programs of needed funds. Will the two disparate ideas end up in a budget package?\nA Stanford University and Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) report entitled Getting Down to Facts II comes ten years after an initial look at California\u2019s education system taking into account all the changes over the past decade. Most newsworthy out of the report was the finance item declaring the need for a 38% increase in education funding to make California students ready for college and careers.\nThe dollar increase was pegged at about $25 billion, equivalent to about 19% of the state\u2019s general fund.\nAn earlier study out of Stanford University by the Institute for Economic Policy Research written by former state assemblyman Joe Nation noted that government pension contributions increased 400% from 2002-3 to 2017-18 and that state and local government\u2019s contributions to pension funds would continue to rise much faster that governments\u2019 operation budgets squeezing core functions.\nReforming the pension system to rein in dramatic increases that are reducing funds for other government missions doesn\u2019t mean that education funding that the PACE study experts want will be met. There is not an equivalent dollar for dollar match.\nBut in considering the two studies there seems to be an opportunity for an honest discussion of government expenditures and spending issues.\nAs Governor-elect Newsom puts together his first budget he will feel the pressure from dominate Democrats in the legislature and the interest groups that help elect them to increase spending. He would be wise to take a page from Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s governing philosophy and row a little on each side of the canoe.\nMeeting all the spending requirements demanded by advocates would amount to an unbearable burden of taxpayers. Where will the new administration go to prove it is concerned with government efficiencies in minding tax dollars?\nTaking on the pension issue would be a good place to implement spending restraint while at the same time dealing with those interests that demand more revenue.

In Mumbai, Anna Hazare refused to give up his three-day fast despite falling ill, but questions were raised about the future of his movement.\nIt was a bitter finale to a day-long animated debate on the Lokpal bill, with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's passionate speech towards the end drowning much of the criticism from opposition MPs. But within a short while, the tables were turned over the constitutional issue, and a fuming Mukherjee cried out that \"it was a sad day for democracy\".\nThe Lokpal bill -- which aims to fight corruption -- was passed by voice vote shortly after Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party MPs walked out, the former saying the proposed legislation was too weak. The Lok Sabha also adopted the whistleblowers protection bill. But the celebration in the treasury benches was shortlived.\nWith 10-15 Congress MPs mysteriously disappearing from the house, the government failed to win requisite majority to give constitutional status to the Lokpal, an idea first mooted in August by Rahul Gandhi. A stunned Congress immediately cracked the whip, announcing it would serve \"show cause\" notices to its missing members.\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushma Swaraj was the first to point out that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) did not have the numbers to get the constitutional bill passed, clause by clause. The government required 50 percent strength of the Lok Sabha and two-thirds voting from the members present. The bill now travels to the Rajya Sabha, where the numbers are clearly stacked against the government.\nAt midnight Tuesday, the Congress was clearly upset. Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal vented his anger at the BJP, saying it had succeeded in preventing the creation of a strong Lokpal and state Lokayuktas with constitutional backing.\nThe BJP, however, said the Lok Sabha had preserved the federal structure of constitution by not accepting the bill to give constitutional status as the states should have the right to decide their Lokayukta laws. The Lokpal bill and the whistle blowers bill will now go to the Rajya Sabha where the government does not have a majority.\nParliament is meeting Dec 27-29 in an extended session to debate and pass the proposed laws, Even as the Lok Sabha furiously debated the Lokpal bill through the day, the 74-year-old Hazare's health suddenly worsened. But he refused to break his hunger strike, saying he was ready to die for the country.\nDoctors attending on him said his blood pressure had shot up, his pulse rate was poor and he was running 102 degrees temperature.

Forgive the clumsy sports analogy, but despite her tender years Malea is a big game player who thrives in the company of superstars. Every rendition so far has been vocal perfection.\nWhen she performed for the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 25, some guy named LeBron James turned around to face her and began applauding as her golden notes electrified a Sunday lunchtime Staples Center crowd.\nSaturday, Malea will sing in front of her biggest gathering, in front of 73,000 supporters at the MLS Cup final between Atlanta United and the Portland Timbers at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a game that will be broadcast in more than 170 countries. No pressure.\nIt has been quite a ride. Just six months ago, Malea was singing in front of a few hundred spectators at minor league soccer games, or World Team Tennis\u2019 Orange County Breakers, and it wasn\u2019t easy for her father Arman to get her booked at those low-key spots. Despite most anthem gigs being unpaid, plenty of aspiring singers view sports events as the perfect place to get noticed and collect reps in front of a live audience, and competition for places is real.\nWhen she was picked for the Los Angeles Galaxy pregame spot in September after winning an online competition, it was the start of a remarkable journey. She not only met global soccer superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who spoke of her talent in glowing terms, but her performance went viral. That led to a swath of international attention, including great interest from Indonesia, where Arman and his wife Esther moved from 11 years ago.\nSoon afterwards invitations from the Clippers and Golden State Warriors followed, as well as the deafening thrill of NHRA drag racing.\nIt didn\u2019t distract her from another smash performance, just like all the others, and suddenly, she is the most sought-after anthem vocalist in the country.\nWhat sets Malea apart is her stature - she stands 3 feet, 9 inches - and the incredible voice that booms from her tiny frame. Her tones are sweet as can be, until she jazzes things up with her trademark \u201cgrowls\u201d \u2013 deliberately inserted voice cracks that add emphasis and feeling into the rockets and their red glares.\nWitnessing her sing at home, it is hard to imagine how she won\u2019t become a star.

Janice Bowling, R-Tullahoma, and Rep. Ron Travis, R-Dayton, said they will introduce the bill in the coming weeks, and their effort is already endorsed by the Tennessee Medical Cannabis Trade Association, according to a news release.\nThe lawmakers and the trade organization described the proposal as a carefully crafted mix of medical marijuana strategies that have worked in other states and stressed that the proposal will be \u201csubstantially different\u201d from bills introduced in prior years.\nBowling also described medical marijuana as a \"natural and effective option for pain relief\" that may help Tennessee escape the opioid epidemic.\nLawmakers have not released the specific language of the bill or the list of qualifying illnesses.\nPrior medical marijuana bills have died before coming up for floor votes in the House and Senate, and Gov.-elect Bill Lee has said he opposes both marijuana legalization and decriminalization.\nSo, the path may be steep, but advocates still plan on pushing the issue.

Each is presented in half chronologically, and then snakes back in opposite chronological order in the second half to reveal the conclusion. The exception is the sixth and final story, which takes place more than a hundred years after the fall of Earth\u2019s future corporation-controlled civilization and is told in full as the center of the novel.\nThe first story follows the journal of a young lawyer named Adam Ewing on board a 19th-century ship in the Pacific Ocean taking him back to his home, wife and son in San Francisco. He is acting as a courier for his law firm and carries with him an unspecified amount of wealth, attracting the attention of many on board the ship. He comes into peril as he becomes increasingly ill with a mysterious parasite.\nThe second is told through the letters of Robert Frobisher, a young musician, to Rufus Sixsmith, a physics student at Cambridge and his male lover, as he flees his home in the early 1930s and heads to Belgium to work with a syphilitic but brilliant English composer. It is from Frobisher that the title originates, as his masterwork composition the \u201cCloud Atlas Sextet,\u201d is the defining work of his life and the source of both his greatness and his fatal flaw.\nA mystery novel comprises the third, following a gossip reporter, Louisa Rey, as she stumbles onto a deadly scandal at a nuclear power plant in the 1970s after running into the grown up and now respected physicist Rufus Sixsmith.\nThe present-day story follows Timothy Cavendish, an aging and failing publisher who comes into success after one of his writers murders a literary critic after receiving a horrible review. Cavendish runs into trouble with some ruffians, and is tricked by his brother into being committed into a nursing home, where he constantly plans his escape.\nThe fifth takes place in a dystopian future society controlled by corporation in which society has created a class of clones to perform what is essentially slave labor. One clone, Sonmi 451, has awakened to her own existence, and, doomed to execution, tells her story in a final interview.\nThe final story is a post-apocalyptic future tale of a new civilization of people that resembles in many ways the \u201csavage\u201d peoples Adam Ewing runs into in his South Pacific journey.

Strong public schools do more than provide opportunity for students and families with children. They strengthen entire communities.\nThe last three biennial state budgets in Wisconsin saw the enactment of dramatic reductions in state spending on K-12 public education. As you may have guessed, deciding to spend less on education as a state has not meant that education is any less expensive today than it was four budgets ago.\nSpoiler alert: It actually costs more, just like everything else does.\nSafe buildings for students to learn in, essential technology tools that enhance the classroom experience, maintenance of athletic facilities that enrich communities as a whole, all of these items and others are essential \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d for schools. Unfortunately, faced with fewer and fewer resources from the state, the reality is that school districts across the state have exhausted their ability do \"do more with less\" and increasingly need the consent of voters to spend more to make up for the failures of the state to support public education.\nIn the Amery School District, the question is whether to spend $1.9 million more than mandated by restrictive state law on a recurring basis for curriculum resources, building maintenance and security, technology and staff salaries. The Wabeno School District is seeking authority to exceed its state-imposed mandate by $1.6 million annually through the 2021-2022 school year in order to maintain current levels of educational programs. These requests are not exorbitant, nor are requests in many districts for the authority to issue new debt. Sadly, this is the new \u201cnormal\u201d forced on districts because the state has not done its part to support K-12 public education.\nThis failure by the state is not fair to our students or our communities. Strong public schools do more than provide opportunity for students and families with children. Great schools strengthen communities for families without children too. Through higher home values that allow individuals and couples to build equity to reductions in crime and improved local business climates that lead to economic growth, great public schools are a benefit to everyone.\nThe good news is that voters get the opportunity to do something about this challenge through our votes on Tuesday. Dozens of ballot questions spanning the state will go before voters.

Already people are condemning it as a threat, but it\u2019s a response in kind to another elected official, who explicitly endorsed incivility that had already occurred and encouraged more of it. It\u2019s not exactly a threat to warn that rewriting the customs of civility might end up backfiring on those who demand such change, and it\u2019s also difficult to put this on Trump when Waters spoke up first.\nWithout mentioning Waters, David Axelrod, former president Barack Obama\u2019s onetime chief strategist, wrote that he was \u201ckind of amazed and appalled by the number of folks on the Left who applauded\u201d Sanders\u2019s expulsion from a restaurant.\nAxelrod and Pelosi aside, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a backlash among Democrats, at least not yet.

Most of the coverage has been of the \u201cRepublicans pounce\u201d variety rather than on the merits and demerits of Waters\u2019 call for harassment of public officials.\nThere\u2019s hypocrisy on both sides of this issue. Donald Trump made incivility a political winner in the presidential election, and regularly uses his Twitter feed to broadcast insults and derisive nicknames directed at his opponents, and sometimes even his political allies. On the other hand, progressives have made a point of running people out of business for failing to adhere to their public orthodoxy. Anyone recall the story of Brendan Eich and Mozilla, for instance? Civility has been declining for a number of years; Trump isn\u2019t the cause of it, he\u2019s one of the outcomes. So too is Maxine Waters, for that matter, and the celebrities jumping on her bandwagon.\nRegardless of her motives, Pelosi\u2019s right, as is Axelrod and the Republicans who did go on the record over the last few days. There is enough blame to share for all of this, and the eventual outcome will be a parallel of F.A.

Whether that statistic concerns you or you simply want to know about your options for a federal law-enforcement career, it's important to know all your options if you are interested in any kind of job securing the country's borders.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection employs more than border patrol agents. It also employs import specialists. These men and women combine specialized commercial and legal expertise with a career in law enforcement. Their job involves detecting and preventing violations of U.S. customs laws and import/export regulations. They also prevent the entry of illegal drugs and other prohibited goods. Job duties include inspecting cargo entering and leaving the United States and working collaboratively with law-enforcement officers and legal professionals. The job requires you to be a U.S. citizen with a bachelor\u2019s degree and at least three years of general work experience. You also must pass a background check and drug screen.\nImmigration officers play an important role in national security, enforcing the regulations of the country\u2019s immigration system. Officers, who work in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are liaisons between the department and federal and state law enforcement and federal intelligence agencies. Their work can include detecting and prosecuting illegal immigrants, especially those who commit fraud by claiming benefits for which they do not qualify. Officers conduct interviews and investigations and prepare reports based on their findings. Officers must have at least a high school diploma or GED.\nThe United States Coast Guard protects the country\u2019s waterways, ports and coasts by patrolling these areas and identifying and investigating potential threats, including attempted human and drug trafficking.

Forest Service law-enforcement officers carry firearms, execute search warrants, complete reports on investigations, make arrests and testify in court. In addition to officers, the department employs special agents, who conduct criminal investigations. The U.S. Forest Service only hires officers who are younger than 37 years of age.

It has additional dialogue, but other than gweneth's enhanced cleavage, there's really nothing extra to be found here.\nMost levels take the form of an open-world environment, allowing you to fly around and take out objectives in whatever order you see fit. Often you'll have secondary objectives, like helicopters firing missiles at you, which you don't have to kill but they can be annoying.\nThis open-world style really suits what an Iron Man game should be. Hovering is as easy as half-pressing left trigger, and things like flying and targeting are pretty easy to get the hang of. You're also able to re-route power to different parts of your suit, such as life support and missiles, and this makes them more powerful.\nYou can't exactly die, either. Instead your suit will power down for a few seconds and then reboot. And I was cool with that Baj. Add in the ability to upgrade your suit with stuff like shields and extra weapons, and you can see they've spent a lot of effort on making the Iron Man suit as cool as possible.\nJust a shame about the rest of the game!\nEnemies are thrown at you in waves, and you can take them out by blasting them, punching them or initiating a quick time event which is basically hitting the circle button really fast. After seeing the same quick-time event for taking out tanks & choppers hundreds of times, you really do get over it, but there's no letting up. Missions go on for too long, and you get bored of doing the same thing over and over.\nBosses are unimaginative, such as a super-chopper, or the one after it, the super tank.

{"idx": "9699", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: President Donald Trump called 12 Senate Democrats on Tuesday, courting their votes on his tax bill that will mostly benefit wealthy people. To the surprise of the Democrats, Trump tried selling the bill by telling them that he would personally \"get killed\" financially by the legislation.\n\"My accountant called me and said 'you're going to get killed in this bill,'\" the president said in a phone call from South Korea, according to NBC News. He also said that the proposed repeal of the estate tax was necessary in order to keep wealthy people happy, NBC News reported.\nTax reform is a life-or-death issue for the president, who has been desperate for a win. Trump's immigration ban stalled in the courts and his health care reform already died with a whimper. As some Republican senators have already voiced their displeasure with the new tax bill, Trump decided he needed to reach across the aisle to ensure he has the votes. Many of the Democrats on the call were from states Trump won in 2016, NBC News reported.\nTaking a page from the \"Art of the Deal,\" Trump made claims on the call that were somewhat dubious.\nSen. Sherrod Brown said after the phone call that the president told the Democrats \"this bill is terrible for rich people, and we [Democrats] don't really agree.\"\nTrump's adviser on legislative affairs, Marc Short, told NBC News after the call that Trump was referring to the elimination of individual deductions in the tax bill. That provision in the bill has not been popular even with Republican congressmen from blue states such as New York. And while that provision could hurt Trump financially, the bill does not eliminate deductions for businesses, so the president's real estate empire would not be harmed in any way.\nOf course, the elimination of the estate tax would be a win for Trump's children, who stand to inherent millions when their father passes.\nTrump's selling point on that provision was laughable at best. He told the Democrats on the phone that he personally wanted a repeal of the estate tax in the bill because \"they had to give something to rich people,\" NBC News reported.\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve been advocating for the elimination of the death tax for a while,\" Short told NBC News.\nA repeal of the estate tax would give the wealthy a $300 billion dollar tax break.\nAccording to NBC News, the phone call dissolved into arguments at some point. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., expressed his frustrations about the process in drafting the bill and got into a \"heated back and forth\" with Short.\nHow the legislation will affect Trump financially is impossible to gauge, considering the president has not released his tax returns. Trump has claimed to be a billionaire, but America found out Tuesday that those claims could easily be feigned. Trump's friend and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has been lying for years about his net worth, telling Forbes he was a billionaire even though he had less than half that.\nThe bill introduced in the House will apparently be different than the one proposed in the Senate, as Republicans haphazardly try to pass tax reform before the new year."}

Along with a few friends from design school, he had managed to set up a small company that manufactured tailor-made packaging solutions for niche retail businesses. However, he was having trouble discovering prospective clients who would recognise his value addition and not see the company as a bubble-wrap and corrugated box manufacturer.\nThen he stumbled upon Bizongo, a B2B marketplace that helps connect solution providers like Mane with large retailers who have specific packaging needs. Bizongo also helped him improve his designs with its in-house team of design engineers.\nBizongo essentially helps businesses design, develop and procure packaging products.\nThe three-year-old start-up by IIT graduates Aniket Deb, Ankit Tomar and Sachin Agrawal offers packaging solutions for everything \u2014 from retail to FMCG to hospitality and medical and pharmaceutical industry. Bizongo recently raised $22 million series B funding from Eduardo Saverin\u2019s B Capital, International Finance Corporation and existing investors Accel Partners and IDG Ventures.\n\u201cFinding the right solution in India\u2019s $40-billion packaging market with over 30,000 vendors is time-consuming. Bizongo makes the process easy by leveraging an in-house design studio, a curated marketplace of over 200 manufacturers and an innovative supply chain technology,\u201d said Kabir Narang, partner and co-lead for Asia investments at B Capital.\nThe current round takes Bizongo\u2019s total funding to $25 million, including the $3 million it raised last November.\nThe company currently operates across Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi regions. Bizongo caters for e-commerce majors like FirstCry and Myntra and retail giant Future Group. \u201cWe debated about different domains for our start-up till we stumbled upon the need for packaging solutions in the B2B space. We spent a lot of time at tradeshows to understand the challenges SMEs faced in purchasing- and selling efficiency-related issues on this front,\u201d said Deb.\nGiven the rise of e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon, the market is abundant with retailers looking for technology-based packaging solutions. Bizongo wanted to go beyond just connecting buyers and sellers and offer more customised solutions instead.\nThe company deals with buyers across sectors having an average annual turnover of Rs 1 billion and more, said Deb. Sellers, on the other hand, are much smaller enterprises and are mostly dependent on tradeshows to help them garner business of around Rs 200-250 million turnover.\nBizongo helps customers define their packaging solution requirement and then find sellers who can meet the need based on material, region and price quotes. The company earns commissions from sellers for successful deals.\nThe company is operationally profitable. It has grown from Rs 500,000 to Rs 100 million in revenues per month since inception.\nPlastic bans across the country may be the main concern for a packaging material supplier, but Deb doesn\u2019t see issues in this regard. \u201cWhenever there is a dearth of plastic options in the market, people start looking for alternatives. Businesses immediately look for biodegradable options, especially in F&B sectors,\u201d Deb said.\nBizongo endorses sustainable packaging and offers in-house sustainable packaging solutions.

The move comes on the heels of the purchase of a small lidar startup by General Motors Co.&apos;s Cruise Automation driverless car unit.\nAfter spending decades farming out an increasing amount of work to independent suppliers, major auto makers are taking a different path when it comes to creating autonomous-driving systems. Lidar, for instance, is a system that could come from a third-party supplier that may not move at the speed that car companies require.\n\"The component providers are not moving fast enough,\" Bryan Salesky, Argo chief executive, said in an interview ahead of the purchase announcement. \"Because they&apos;re not moving fast enough we feel like we need to take more of a lead role in getting the right sensor out there.\"\nFord announced earlier this year it acquired control of Pittsburg-based Argo AI, committing to $1 billion in investment. The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker aims to have commercially viable driverless cars by 2021, and Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett has said the company is studying the best way to deploy the technology. On Thursday, Mr. Hackett suggested to analysts that a test deployment in a market may occur next year.\nFord is racing against a long list of competitors in both the auto and tech industries aiming to perfect driverless cars. Along with GM, Toyota Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and Alphabet Inc. are among those spending an increasing amount of resources and hiring additional staff for the moonshot project.\nLidar is a uniquely-important component in helping auto makers or tech firms meet their autonomous-vehicle targets. Many industry have said it is difficult in finding a company to produce enough of the devices.\nOwning lidar development in-house could allow the Argo team to work more closely to integrate its abilities into the autonomous vehicle software. It is a path forged by Google-parent Alphabet&apos;s self-driving unit Waymo, which claims to have lowered the cost of its lidar by 90%.\nThe Cranbury, N.J.-based Princeton Lightwave, founded in 2000, has more than 30 employees and already sells sensors to clients in the telecom and defense industries. The company&apos;s website says its lidar is capable of identifying objects at 350 meters, or nearly a quarter of a mile, traveling at 60 miles an hour -- an impressive distance for the technology.\n\"I&apos;m not just buying an idea or some interesting [intellectual property] that may or may not play out, I&apos;m really getting a very knowledgeable team that knows how to build these products,\" Mr. Salesky said.\nDozens of companies are racing to develop lidar -- which stands for light detection and ranging and works by bouncing lasers off objects to create a 3-D view of the world -- but large-scale production hasn&apos;t kicked in yet.\nVelodyne LiDAR Inc. in January opened a new factory in San Jose, Calif., to ramp up production with the aim"}

Will it fly financially?\nAnyone who has flown in the same airplane as restless kids knows how annoying they can get. Delta Air Lines Inc.'s new low-cost airline, Song, says it has a solution for children and adults who want a better in-flight experience, and that plan relies heavily on information technology.\nThe self-proclaimed all-digital airline launched April 15 with four flights a day from New York to Florida, and it plans to offer 144 fights on 36 Boeing 757 planes between even more cities by year's end. The move marks Delta's entry into the low-cost airline market, and it's counting on technology to differentiate Song from competitors during a challenging time for all airlines. Song will be the first to use Matsushita Avionics Systems Corp.'s eFx technology for narrow-body planes beginning in September (see story below).\nOn board, kids (and adults) can play video games against other passengers on personal video screens installed on the back of every seat. Passengers also can rent movies for about the same price they'd pay at the neighborhood video store, shop online, watch satellite TV, or download customized MP3 audio for the flight.\nSong's in-flight technology sets it apart from the competition, says Mapes, managing director of marketing.\n\"Parents are willing to pay for games that will keep their children occupied,\" says Tim Mapes, managing director of marketing for Song. Passengers can run their credit cards through a swiper attached to the seat-back screen to buy the video games or movies. Some of the on-board technology, such as satellite TV and displays of connecting gate information, will be free. When available, the rest will be \"fairly priced\" based on research indicating how much passengers are willing to pay for various services, Mapes says. Song views the in-flight technology as a key differentiator between itself and other low-cost airlines such as ATA, JetBlue, and Southwest Airlines.\nEdmund Greenslet, who spent 23 years on Wall Street as an aviation analyst and is now publisher of newsletter \"The Airline Monitor,\" doubts Song will stay aloft for long. \"I don't think an airline within an airline is an avenue that's going to be the salvation of the big carriers. In the past, none of them have worked,\" he says. \"You have a culture, a system, and a pay scale that is different, and you're trying to graft these things together. It never works.\"\nSong's technology extends beyond in-flight entertainment, though. For instance, the airline boasts the first voice-recognition ticket-purchasing system. Company executives want customers to benefit from IT every time they deal with the airline. \"Technology is such a major part of the lives we all lead today,\" Mapes says. \"We found a lot of appeal to a tech-based airline.\"\nDelta, which reported a loss of $1.3 billion in 2002 on revenue of $13.3 billion, has spent the past few years improving its own information technology.

John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s Rabbit Hole is about closed-in people, but he chooses to begin his film in the open space of a yard, somewhat like the similar first shot of Carolyn Burnham in American Beauty. With Rabbit Hole, we meet the neighbors, we see what kind of lives our protagonists, Becca and Howie, should be leading. Then, we see them hiding in a house to avoid a neighborhood grill-out. We see them go to group therapy, scarcely speaking and never touching unless forced. We wonder what has happened. Rabbit Hole is about closed-in people who maybe weren\u2019t so closed-in all that long ago.\nIf Rabbit Hole is about closed-in characters, it is also about distance. Eight months after their son, Danny, was killed in a freak car accident, Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are still stuck in the throes of mourning. To compound matters, both are dealing with the process in nearly opposite manners. Becca wants to throw Danny\u2019s things away, hide all evidence he existed, and move out. Howie wants the little reminders around, wants to talk about his loss with others, and maybe wants to try to have another child.\nThey are learning to get along with their lives despite their distance. It helps that Becca has a mother, Nat (Dianne Wiest), who has raised several very different children and has lost a boy not too long ago. Howie finds a friend in Gaby (Sandra Oh) after he continues to go to group therapy despite Becca\u2019s dropout. But when Becca begins seeing Jason, the boy responsible for her son\u2019s accident, it causes more turmoil to boil under the surface than could possibly ever be laid bare.\nRabbit Hole is an emotional movie, but it isn\u2019t all emotional. There\u2019s ski ball, Jesus jokes, drunk mothers at bowling alleys, and comic-book existentialism -- in short, a bunch of underappreciated moments that normally would be thrust aside in a film like this in favor of reaching dark depths. Becca and Howie aren\u2019t the usual type of grieving couple you see on screen, they are just living their lives and doing the best they goddamned can. In a span of an hour and a half, they get a lot further than most movie couples facing loss.\nLoss is like a tide, coming in and going out with various force and fervor. Kudos to John Cameron Mitchell for stepping out of the realm of the avant-garde to make a straight film about two people riding the tide. It\u2019s funny how it takes so many highs and lows to land back in the middle. We may never learn if Becca and Howie make it, but just getting going is a journey in itself.\nExtras are scant on the disc. There are three deleted scenes, which only served to confirm my suspicion that John Cameron Mitchell had no time or budget to waste. It's a shame to see that most of the deleted scenes are shining moments for Becca\u2019s sister, Izzy, played by Tammy Blanchard. That\u2019s the sucky part of playing a secondary character, though.\nThe disc also includes a trailer -- no surprise there -- and then, commentary rounds out the special features.

He consistently delivers a mind-nourishing message that strengthens hearers for the entire week to come. He knows his subject matter and history well. He taught Hebrew in the Seminary.\nHis sermon title for this morning was, Sticks and Stones, relating the persecution and vituperative hatred that is openly hurled against those who are Christians (not those who just say it but those who actually are). He used for his text: St. Luke 5:11: \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.\"\nWith that as the compass, this writer is GREATLY blessed. The psychotic hatred against Christians is spawned against God, not at the targeted individual, or for anything that individual did or even said. The atheist does not even see the individual as a person but rather a threatening shadow. That is how blinded they are as they live in a modern version of Plato's Cave.\nThere are those who have occupations that generate hatred without effort such as meter-maids, traffic cops, process servers, murderers, rapists, thieves and lawyers. But that hatred comes from what they do that affects your life, not what they think.\nChristianity is the only culture that is actively and violently excoriated simply because of a quiet inward belief in God,and the way believers live their lives. The offense this brings to the world is simply for being. Frantic effort is made to attack, criticize, ridicule and threaten anyone they observe whose living standards put a spotlight on their own sins, bringing desperate fear that they will be compelled to alter their lives. They do not want to give up their sins. As one cross-dresser said to me, \"I can't give that up.\"\nWords are not even necessary. Just observing a believer in God appears to kick atheists in the gut putting them into a fight or flight mode.\nYet, Callum had a driving force to attack me with such vicious editorials that I had every legal right to sue him and his paper. That wasn't necessary. This ministry was too well known in Northern California. Thousands of subscribers cancelled their subscriptions followed by their main advertisers pulling out. The paper went belly-up and Callum was literally run out of town. But he HAD to attack simply because he was 'gay' and I was a Christian. There was absolutely no valid reason except his own guilty conscience triggered by simply seeing me which reflected his own distorted image of himself.\nHowever, it is not just 'the world' that a Christian must deal with. The harshest attacks of all come from...Christians! They can be nasty. Let anyone write a story concerning theology or even a testimony of God's blessings, and the righteous immediately march forth to tell everything they perceive as wrong in a public statement or story in order to 'set the record straight' and to bring attention to themselves.\nThis is perpetrated by an inward blast of ego that compels them to prove that they are much holier and more learned theologians than the writer of the piece with solid credentials.

But hurry.\nYou've got a lot of traveling to do if you're going to see some of the historical wonders of the world before climate change further damages them, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\nAcross the Mediterranean region, flood risk may increase by 50 percent and erosion risk by 13 percent by the year 2100, the study found, with considerably higher increases at specific World Heritage sites, areas chosen to be preserved due to their importance in human history.\nThe impact on those historical icons would be significant, the study warned, unless actions are taken quickly.\n\"Adaptation planning is urgently needed,\" said lead author Lena Reimann, a doctoral researcher for the Coastal Risks and Sea-Level Rise Research Group in Germany. \"If our common heritage is destroyed or lost, it is not possible to replace or rebuild it.\"\nThere are 1,092 cultural historical sites on the 2018 World Heritage List, which, according to the authors, have \"high intangible value as they represent icons of human civilization.\"\nBecause our ancestors often settled near water for both food and commerce, a good many are in coastal areas, especially in the historically rich Mediterranean region. Due to the steep topography of many of the sites clustered along the Mediterranean Sea, most cities, then and now, were built at the water's edge.\nMany of those World Heritage sites are already at risk from rising sea levels. Venice, for example, has been thought to be sinking for years. In reality, Venice floods regularly, and has done so for centuries. In 1996, a combination of rain, high tides and high wind caused the canals to rise a devastating six feet above normal levels.\nThat's today. But little is known about the potential future effects of the flooding and erosion climate change may bring, and that was what this study was designed to address.\nThe researchers ranked and compared 49 locations facing the highest risk from a total of 159 World Heritage sites lining the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the sheer numbers of historical sites along their coasts, a third of those endangered sites were located in just four countries: Italy (15), Croatia (7), Greece (4) and Tunisia (4).\nThe study's design explored the risk of flooding and erosion under four different sea-level rise scenarios until 2100, ranging from no risk to highest risk.\nFlooding risk was highest for cities along the northern Adriatic Sea. Some are in severe danger now. Besides Venice and its lagoon, the Italian city of Ferrara and its wetlands of Po Delta and the Patriarchal Basilica of Aquileia at the northern coast of Italy are currently at high risk due to rising sea levels.\nTo determine future flood risk, the researchers combined flood area and flood depth; they found the flood risk index under the worst-case scenario to increase by up to 50 percent until 2100 across the region. The maximum flood depth, they found, may rise by 290 percent across the region. In Venice, maximum flood depth may be as high as 2.5 meters or 8 feet above normal levels.\nThe study also looked at the cost of erosion by flood waters and found 42 of the 49 sites were suffering coastal erosion today.

The dosage would be set in consultation with a doctor or other medical professional, but no psychological or medical treatment would be mandated. Only those younger than 18 would be required to see a drug counselor before receiving an access card.\n''The dose would be programmed in,'' he continued. ''The consumer would run the card with its magnetic strip through the machine and the drug store would supply, for example, a gram of heroin for 12 Swiss francs.'' A gram of heroin or cocaine currently costs about $36 on the street and 12 Swiss francs equal about $8.70.\nOpinion polls indicate that only about 40 percent of Swiss support the liberalization idea. That would suggest passage is unlikely. But the drug issue pervades Switzerland, where federal statistics count between 30,000 and 36,000 narcotics addicts, most of them using heroin.\nEstimates indicate that 500,000 Swiss -- of a total population of 7 million -- routinely use cannabis, and initiative supporters believe that even if their measure is defeated on Sunday, the widespread debate over it will clear the way for legalization of cannabis.\nA leading Swiss magazine, L'Illustre, found in a recent poll that even among those polled who oppose Sunday's legalization initiative, 40 percent would back the legal sale of cannabis for people over 18, and 51 percent its sale for medical purposes.\nUnlike other European countries that tolerate cannabis consumption, Switzerland pursues and punishes it. Last year, four out of five arrests were for marijuana and hashish use. Penalties range from one day to three months in jail for second-time users, and up to three years for heavy users, according to the federal police.\nGovernment officials say they fear that drug liberalization would eviscerate their efforts to address Switzerland's serious drug problem. Figures from the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon suggest that drug use in Switzerland is among the highest in Europe, rivaled only by Italy, Spain and tiny Luxembourg in drug use per 1,000 adults.\nSwitzerland's drug problems were exposed when authorities experimented with open access to drugs in Zurich beginning in 1989.

Simply put, it\u2019ll get smarter as more customers interact with it.\nAI was given a test run in several restaurants last year, and it seems that the company\u2019s head honchos were happy with its performance. Daniel Henry, McDonald\u2019s chief information officer, told Wired he expects to see the technology in 1,000 locations within the next three months, eventually rolling out to the company\u2019s 14,000 U.S. restaurants and beyond.\nThe AI integration likely will expand to kitchen management, in-store kiosks, mobile ordering and payment procedures. With 68 million customers served daily and more than 35,000 restaurants worldwide, there\u2019s plenty of data for AI to store and learn from.\nThis move did not come unwarranted. McDonald\u2019s queried 30 candidate companies that offer similar personalization services, and only Digital Yield made the cut. Before getting acquired, the company already provided services to more than 300 brands worldwide, including Ikea, Sephora and Urban Outfitters.\nThe acquisition not only proves the quality of Digital Yield\u2019s work, but it also shows that a growing number of companies have recognized the main advantage of a combination of big data and AI: mass personalization. That is, the ability to customize goods and services to appeal to a large number of people, while keeping up with their quirks and personal preferences. I believe McDonald\u2019s is taking a step in the right direction, one that its competitors (and those beyond the fast-food industry) will most likely follow.\nWhat do you think?

{"idx": "9729", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I came home one afternoon to find my husband sitting at the kitchen table, abruptly laid off from a job he'd held for almost two decades.\nHe numbly talked about retiring.\nI immediately began to pray, making the transition to a calmer state of thought by being grateful for the many years of answered prayer I had witnessed in my life. I reaffirmed that whatever we did now would be done happily, under God's guidance. I even began to see this as an opportunity to relocate to a new area, closer to a loved relative, and to be able to spend more time with my husband.\nAs a little girl, when my dad's work compelled us to move again and again, my mother and grandmother encouraged me to take into the \"closet of prayer\" the idea that God is everywhere and that He loves me; so any change in circumstances couldn't deprive me of happiness. I found this to be true in each of the 22 moves my family made before I was 18.\nThe idea of the \"closet of prayer\" is biblical. When my grandmother and mother had begun to study Christian Science in the 1930s, they turned for guidance to Jesus' words: \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly\" (Matt. 6:6).\nThey found in the textbook of Christian Science by Mary Baker Eddy, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" a passage that explains the importance of private, silent prayer: \"The closet typifies the sanctuary of Spirit, the door of which shuts out sinful sense but lets in Truth, Life, and Love. Closed to error, it is open to Truth, and vice versa\" (page 15).\nI've been helped time and again over the years by praying in that way, and I trusted that praying would help our family's situation this time, too.\nI was perplexed, though, a few days after my husband was laid off to discover that, instead of preparing to retire, he was updating his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, attending seminars for displaced executives, and networking.\nI was momentarily tempted to campaign for moving; but my prayer had steadied me and confirmed my trust in God. Also, for 25 years I had watched my husband pray daily, five times a day, without fail. Wasn't God speaking to him, too? As the weeks passed, I decided to be entirely obedient to God's will and to listen, moment by moment, for His direction.\nThree months later, there was still no job possibility in sight. Colleagues tried to get him a position, but nothing came of it. Interviews went nowhere. Downsizing and layoffs were occurring throughout the industry. When one door after another closed on him, my husband became deeply afraid that his age was hindering the search. He was too young to retire, but too old to be an attractive candidate.\nClearly, I decided, another door needed to close - the one on fear. I prayed to be delivered from believing that any of the God-given qualities and abilities my husband expressed could ever become obsolete. I stopped several times during the day to understand that human policies and conditions couldn't interfere with God's purpose for him. I recognized his unbreakable relationship to the infinite God by celebrating the immortality of qualities he already expressed, such as his steadfastness; refusal to indulge in self-pity; courage; wisdom; ability to joyfully solve technical problems;"}

The team increased the size of the building but decreased the area of the windows in order to reduce solar gain; they also placed them more strategically within the structure. As a result, Germany's house is a two-story cube with windows concentrated on the northern and southern sides. The windows are also shaded by automated louvers and triple glazed to have a U value below 0.8.\n\"We were able to increase the space inside by 10 square meters [108 square feet] by reducing the thickness of the walls,\" Martin Zeimer, the team's architectural adviser from Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, says. The facade is made of custom vacuum insulation panels covered with CIGS (copper indium gallium diselenide) thin-film solar panels. \"The whole building is solar active,\" Zeimer says. \"We wanted to increase solar collection, and the surface of the building is normally the most expensive aspect of the wall, so we were able to spend all that money on photovoltaics instead.\"\nThe roof supports 11.1 kilowatts of photovoltaic panels, too, but the team expects 200 percent of the home's energy needs to come from the thin-film on the facade--even though CIGS efficiency is only 11 percent, lower than the 18 percent efficiency of the monocrystalline rooftop array. If the thin-film heats up, it doesn't lower its efficiency as much, Zeimer says, and it also copes better with indirect solar radiation, which meant that they were able to cover the house's north wall as well.\nInside, the house is one large room with a second-story gallery. \"One of the main goals of the building is not to go out as architects and tell people how to live, but to let people use the building to reflect how they live,\" Zeimer says. An electric air-source heat pump for heating and cooling the house and providing hot water is concealed in a closet by the bedroom--essentially, a bed that pulls out from a low step leading up to the center of the room.\nSupplementing the heat pump for cooling the room is 1 ton of phase-change material in cavities in the ceiling. Warm air is absorbed up into the salt hydrate, which makes it fluid. After about a day and a half, that energy needs to be released, so PV panels in the facade open, exposing the cavities to the cool night air. The air moves through them, deloading the system, and the salt hydrate returns to a phase that resembles ice.\nAfter the Solar Decathlon, the house will be shipped back to Germany. The team hopes to do more research on the building. \"We know the technologies run well individually,\" Zeimer says, \"but we don't know how they run as a system.\""}

He's lost more games than he's won in six of his ten seasons as a journeyman with the Rangers, Mariners, Twins, and Mets, and had to switch to throwing knuckleballs late in his career just to stay employed.\nTwo years ago, Dickey was the first player cut by the Mets during spring training, which should have meant the end of his career. Instead, he ignored critics and his own body to return. He gained consistency, endeared himself to the fans, found his track, and this year, Dickey led the National League in strikeouts and innings pitched while becoming the third-oldest pitcher in history to record twenty wins for the first time in his career.\nNow 38, he's won the Cy Young, an award typically reserved for rising superstars.

I'm so grateful we're in the fight, we have a good car and we can compete.\n\"The car's not necessarily the fastest, but we're as fast as our rivals.\"\nWith Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber of Red Bull and McLaren's Jenson Button failing to score, Alonso extended his lead in the championship following his rise from 10th on the grid to third at the finish.\nBut with Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus netting another strong points finish in fifth, it means just two points separate Hamilton in second, Raikkonen in third and Vettel in fourth. Webber is only eight points further back.\n\"[The win] is great for the championship,\" added Hamilton. \"It just shows that anything can happen. I've had some real bad races and some good ones - and I hope some more good ones are coming.\n\"We've had some great performances in the last few races but I've not picked up points in all of them so I need to improve on that area.\n\"It's going to be incredibly tough.

However, after running 155.219 mph, he didn't need more than one lap.\nBiffle easily won the pole for Sunday's race, saying his plan all along was to channel his attention into a single lap.\n\"It does take a lot of nerve, but when these guys give me cars like this it makes it easy on me,\" Biffle said. \"I tell you what, normally Dover is one of the toughest places to qualify. You're always on edge. Obviously, last year I qualified; on the first lap I was on the pole and on the second lap I spun out. Fortunately, I didn't damage the car and ended up starting.

The referendum campaign had originally said its financing was from a Delaware company called Capital Productions LLC.\nBridge Capital is an offshore investment firm run by John K. Baldwin and Shawn Scott, casino developers whose previous projects, court records show, have left a trail of litigation from Guam to Washington, D.C.\nScott is known for spearheading a successful referendum effort that brought slot machines to Maine, but receded from public view after failing to win casino licenses in several states amid concerns about his associates and his background.\nUntil now, the main proponent for Question 1, which would pave the way for a slots parlor to be built in Revere near the Suffolk Downs racetrack, had denied involvement by Scott or his partners, even though his campaign strategy appeared to be taken from Scott\u2019s playbook.\nEugene A. McCain Jr., a developer who moved from Thailand to Revere to push for the ballot question, told the Globe last month that the men were not involved in the effort.\nThe men\u2019s involvement emerged from financial disclosures filed Wednesday with the state\u2019s Office of Campaign and Political Finance. It was unclear what spurred the filing, which was not due until Monday at midnight, when it might easily have gone unnoticed until after the election.\nOn Tuesday, the Globe had asked McCain to comment on revelations that he had been involved with the casino owners in their long-running financial and legal dispute with the government of Laos. McCain had previously told the Globe that he had not been involved with a casino project before Revere.\nMcCain and his campaign committee chairman, Jason Osborne, have not returned calls since. Lawyers who represented the casino owners in Laos and Baldwin and Scott in other ventures did not return phone calls, either.\nA Globe review of legal documents had found that McCain provided testimony for the casino owners in their case against the Laotian government. An international tribunal\u2019s decision in the case, available online, cited McCain\u2019s testimony saying he was sent by the casino group to a Bangkok engineering firm to obtain information about a potential competitor casino in February 2015. The casino group used his witness statement \u2014 ultimately unsuccessfully \u2014 to build a case that the Laotian government was violating their contract by giving tacit approval to a competitor.\nThat litigation began when the casino owners disputed their share of gambling proceeds and led to government countercharges of money laundering, embezzlement, corruption, and bribery.\nBoth sides abandoned their claims in a 2014 agreement that required the casino to be sold to buyers with no connection to Baldwin, Scott, or any of their companies or associates and that called for Hoolae Paoa, a third principal, to be fired and barred from profiting from the proceeds of the casino\u2019s sale.

{"idx": "9748", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It might seem like common sense that inactive people have a greater risk for heart disease than active people, but a new study has measured the risk in terms of time spent in front of a computer, according to the Deccan Herald.\nThe study, out of the University College London, confirms that time spent at a computer is as damaging to the heart as time spent lounging in front of a television screen. People who work on computers or watch television for four or more hours a day are 125 percent more likely to suffer a major heart problem than those who spend two hours or less.\nThat's bad news for anyone who spends their 9-to-5 job working on a computer. Even worse, the study also found a 48 percent increase in deaths from any cause among people who spent excessive time staring at a computer or television screen.\nThe results were consistent even among individuals who spent time every day exercising, meaning that exercise during other hours could not reverse the damage caused by extended inactivity.\n\"Our analysis suggests that two or more hours of screen time each day may place someone at greater risk for a cardiac event,\" said Dr. Emmanuel Stamatakis, who led the study. \"People who spend excessive amounts of time in front of a screen are more likely to die of any cause and suffer heart-related problems.\"\nResearchers noted that prolonged sitting can cause a 90 percent reduction in a heart-healthy enzyme, lipoprotein lipase, which could explain the results. Inflammation and metabolic problems caused by long periods of inactivity are undoubtedly also to blame.\nThe report advised anyone who sits on their computer for extended periods of time to take breaks for a brief walk every 20 minutes.\n\"A totally feasible and realistic redesign of the workplace and home environments can easily convert long periods of time during the workday that currently are strictly sedentary into a mixture of sitting, standing and light intensity activity,\" said Stamatakis.\nIn other words, the key to reducing risk is to break up time spent being sedentary with periodic exercise rather than just setting aside a later block of time in the day for that exercise. And if you spend your work day at the computer, definitely don't go home and spend the rest of your day in front of the television.\nBryan Nelson writes for the Mother Nature Network."}

But Victoria\u2019s Secret sparked a public furor last month when it advertised its Body lingerie line by emblazoning its familiar brand image of thin underwear models with the text, \"The Perfect 'Body.\u2019\"\nThe ad was widely slammed as offensive and damaging to women. More than 26,000 people signed a petition calling on the retailer to apologize and axe the campaign.\n\"It is one thing to show women and imply something, but it is quite another thing to say it outright,\" says Julie Sygiel, founder and CEO of underwear retailer Dear Kate. \"Victoria\u2019s Secret took it too far with this campaign.\"\nIt\u2019s important to note that in this case the issue does not lie with the size of the women featured in the ad, because brands such as Victoria\u2019s Secret tend to not carry plus sizes, says Tracy Anderson, VP and account director at Burrell Communications.\nThe problem, she explains, is a word such as \"perfect\" should never be used when communicating about body image.\n\"It is dangerous to refer to anything or anyone as \u2018perfect,\u2019 and by taking that approach you are going in at a deficit and you could potentially give someone a complex,\" contends Anderson. \"\u2018Perfect\u2019 and the idea of \u2018perfection\u2019 is slightly outdated at this point, because everyone is running with the whole \u2018perfectly imperfect\u2019 thing.\"\nOn the other hand, if a brand trades its lean models for heavier ones and claims they are \"real women\" in a campaign, that can imply skinny women are less \"real,\" Sygiel explains.\n\"Thinking carefully about the message you are sending is important, because every woman\u2019s body is valid,\" she says. \"You don\u2019t have to put down certain body shapes in order to uplift other body shapes.\"\nWomen, of course, come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, so brands need to ensure they are formulating their messaging accordingly. The happy medium is simply being inclusive when discussing body image, according to Anderson.\n\"Multicultural consumers and women of color, for instance, may have different definitions of \u2018perfection,\u2019\" she adds.\nA number of brands highlighted their own inclusivity on body image in response to Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s faux pas.\nOne was smaller rival Dear Kate, which published a blog post on its corporate website about Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s \"irresponsible marketing,\" and recreated the infamous ad to show women from a range of different ethnicities and body shapes wearing its underwear.

{"idx": "9766", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Last week, NASA reported that its Voyager 1 spacecraft, the farthest spacecraft (operational or non-operational) from Earth, is getting very near to interstellar space.\nIn December 2004, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to pass the \"termination shock\" (the edge of the dark blue circle in the image at the link above). This is where the Sun's solar wind starts to dramatically slow down (to sub-sonic speeds), indicating a lessening of the Sun's influence. The termination shock is still well within the heliosphere, where the Sun's magnetic forces and solar wind outweigh the magnetic forces of the galaxy and the force of the galactic (i.e., interstellar) wind.\nEver since that time, Voyager 1 has been traveling through the the \"heliosheath\"--the part of the heliosphere between the termination shock and the \"heliopause,\" which is the edge of the solar system. In recent months, Voyager researchers have noticed that the number of charged particles detected from outside the solar system is increasing dramatically and much more rapidly than before. In the most recent week of recorded data, these particles have increased 5%. In the most recent month, they have increased 9% total. In the 3 years before that, these interstellar particles have increase only a total of 25%. Something is changing now--and the change is getting faster and faster.\nResearchers are estimating that Voyager 1 might be only weeks or months away from crossing the heliopause, where it will become the first human-made object to reach interstellar space. This should allow Voyager 1 to transmit back to us the first in situ measurements from there.\nThe timing of this passage could not be better. In 2015, the data recorder on board the spacecraft will stop being used because of power limitations. The nuclear fuel on board Voyager 1 will seriously taper off in 2020, severely limiting the power for the scientific instruments themselves. Around 2025, Voyager 1 should use up its nuclear fuel completely, and will lose contact with the Earth.\nVoyager 1 has taken 34 years to go from the Earth to this point, traveling at approximately 38,000 miles per hour (61,155 kilometers per hour) after its encounter with Saturn in late 1980. It was going a bit slower than that before, but gravity assists from Jupiter and Saturn propelled it to that speed. The spacecraft is now 3.75 times the distance from the Sun that Pluto is.\nThe solar system might seem huge, taking 34 years or so to get to the edge of it--but that's just peanuts compared to the size of interstellar space. If Voyager 1 was pointed towards the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, (it's not, but for example's sake) it would take it approximately 76,443 additional years to reach it from its current position (assuming constant speed and assuming the stars stayed still). To get a sense of how long that is, modern humans were living alongside Neanderthals that long ago!\nAt any rate, probably at some point in the coming months we can claim to be a species with interstellar capabilities (super, super tenuous as it is). Still, it's pretty cool! Hopefully we'll learn some good stuff!\nTribus: Now with more Moral Reprehensiveness!\nIs there"}

Figuring it was just the heat and humidity, she didn't think much of it, that is, until it wouldn't go away. Eventually a prickly sensation invaded her feet and exhaustion swept through her body, so she decided it was now time to seek help.\nAfter a referral to a neurologist and a test for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic disease that effects the central nervous system, Jolly was receiving some unclear answers. The results came back negative; however, doctors were convinced that MS was infecting her, so that's what she was treated for.\nJolly, of Alanson, would later find out that this would be the beginning of a very long and tiresome journey. Little did she know she would end up traveling throughout the country trying to find someone that could tell her what was wrong with her - with little luck.\n\"I actually had one doctor say to me once, 'I know you're really sick, but I'm sorry I'm not smart enough to figure out what it is,'\" said Jolly with a grin on her face, though admitting she wasn't all smiles at the time.\nJolly dealt with her condition as best she could for more than five years.

A tragic period begins,\u201d said Ilias Iliopoulos, secretary general of public sector union ADEDY, which represents half a million workers.\nMany in Greece fear strings attached to the 40-45 billion euro ($53.8 to 60.5 billion) aid package, if the cash-strapped nation decides to tap it, will hit living standards in a country where one person in five lives below the poverty threshold, according to EU data.\nParteniou said she agreed with the strike but would not take part because she could not afford to lose a day\u2019s pay.\nThe socialist government, pressured by markets and EU policymakers to tidy up its finances, has vowed to go ahead with reforms but Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Wednesday no more austerity measures would take place this year.\nNewspaper editorials showed little sympathy for the strike, saying the government had no choice but to enact austerity measures and tap the aid package after the yield on Greece\u2019s 10-year bond jumped to 8.4 percent on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have to find the money somewhere because the civil servants that are striking today will have to be paid at the end of the month,\u201d center-left daily Ethnos wrote in an editorial.\nInvestors and policymakers are closely watching the protest \u2014 the fourth nationwide strike organized by the public sector union this year \u2014 as concerns grow over whether Greece will honor its plan to slash its double-digit budget deficit to under 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2012.\nOpposition to the measures has so far been relatively muted, although polls show most Greeks oppose them. Violence has been much less frequent than in 2008 riots that paralyzed Athens for weeks after the police killing of a teenager.\nWorries about the recession and a surge in unemployment highlight the delicate balance Athens needs to strike in meeting international demands for cutbacks while maintaining enough support at home to ensure it can implement the reforms.\nOn Wednesday, the IMF said unemployment would rise to 13 percent in 2011, and Greece would be the only euro zone country to see its economy contract next year with a 1.1 percent drop.\nAir traffic controllers have decided not to strike on Thursday, saying they did not want to further burden travelers and aggravate flight disruptions caused by the cloud of volcanic ash that caused havoc this week across Europe."}

By Telegraph Travel's France experts.\nFrance is so full of culture that it's a wonder there's room for anything else. And the French look after it with exceptional zeal. There are few walls over five years old which lack a preservation order. So there are choices to be made, whether you're on a wholly cultural break, or merely require a bit of culture to elevate an otherwise idle holiday.\nFor pre-history, you need the Lot or the Dordogne and, especially, the V\u00e9z\u00e8re valley, which late Palaeolithic man found a particularly des res and there can be found a damage-proof replica of the famed Lascaux cave. The museum in Les Eyzies has the story, the Font-de-Gaume cave the most moving wall art. Later, the Romans were all over the place, but I'd head south for the great arenas of N\u00eemes and Arles (where they're still spilling blood, in bull-fights), and the nearby Pont-du-Gard, the ancient world's finest aqueduct astoundingly intact.\nFans of medieval times will be looking for the magnificent Gothic cathedrals - Reims, Rouen, Beauvais, Chartres, the biggest of the lot at Amiens and, naturally, Notre-Dame in Paris. But they should also divert to one of France's most fascinating historical sites: Gu\u00e9delon at Treigny in northern Burgundy (guedelon.fr). Here stout folk are recreating a 13th-century castle using only 13th-century methods.\nSuch ancien r\u00e9gime excesses led to the French revolution. Essentially, a Parisian revolution, this may be tackled, first, by visiting the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet - Paris' history museum (carnavalet.paris.fr) - and then by a revolution-themed walking tour. Try the British-owned Paris Walks (paris-walks.com). The 19th-century had the Impressionists capturing movement and light in Paris, the Ile-de-France and Normandy. Alongside the Orangerie (musee-orangerie.fr) and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay (musee-orsay.fr) in the capital, don't ignore the Fine Arts Museums in Caen, Rouen, and Le Havre.\nModern artists \u2013 Matisse, Picasso, L\u00e9ger, Cocteau - headed south, for the light, and the flexible morality. You\u2019ll find them in eponymous museums in, respectively, Nice, Antibes, Biot and Menton. Meanwhile, contemporary art gathers, of course, at the Parisian Pompidou centre \u2013 which now has a branch at Metz (centre-pompidou-metz.fr), just as the Louvre has a brand new outpost in the old mining centre of Lens (louvrelens.fr). This latter works brilliantly, allowing an overview of world art in two hours \u2013 rather than the two decades it would take to bottom the main collections in Paris.\nMeanwhile, there is scarcely a village or town in France which doesn\u2019t have a festival.

{"idx": "9774", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: With permission Mr Speaker I should like to make a statement about our programme of constitutional renewal. With this Statement are published a White Paper, the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, and an analysis of the responses to our consultations. Copies of these are available in the Vote Office and on my ministry's website.\nMr Speaker, the accountability of government is fundamental to the health of our democracy. Arbitrary action and lack of transparency can subvert that. But, for decades, the royal prerogative has been used by successive governments to sustain executive power.\nLast July, my Right Honourable Friend, the prime minister announced his determination that the government he leads would reverse this process and surrender significant executive powers to Parliament or otherwise limit them.\nFollowing my Right Honourable Friend's July statement and the accompanying Governance of Britain Green Paper, five consultation papers were issued. I am grateful to all who responded. We have taken account of their views in the White Paper and the draft Bill.\n1. Protest around Parliament: In July the prime minister undertook to consult widely on managing protests around Parliament to ensure that people's right to protest was not subject to unnecessary restrictions.\nOur view is that Parliament itself is best placed to decide what needs to be secured to ensure Members are able freely to discharge their responsibilities. Clause 1 of the draft Bill therefore repeals sections 132-138 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. We invite the views of Parliament on whether additional provision is needed to keep open the passages leading to the Palace of Westminster and to ensure that, for example, excessive noise is not used to disrupt the workings of Parliament.\nPart 2 of the Bill sets out major reforms to the role of the Attorney General, and the management of prosecutions, to make the arrangements more transparent and to enhance public confidence. The proposals involve recasting the relationship between the Attorney and the prosecuting authorities.\nIn particular the Attorney will cease to have any power to give directions to prosecutors in individual cases, save in certain exceptional cases which give rise to issues of national security. The Attorney will have to report to Parliament on any exercise of that power.\nBy clause 3 there would be a protocol which will set out how the Attorney and the prosecuting authorities are to exercise their functions in relation to each other. This will be laid before Parliament, as will an Annual Report. We do not propose changing the Attorney's role as chief legal adviser to the government or his or her attendance at Cabinet.\nPart three of the Bill builds on the significant reforms introduced by my Right Honourable and Noble Friend Lord Falconer to reinforce the independence of the judiciary. The Bill proposes to remove the Prime Minister entirely from making judicial appointments, and the Lord Chancellor from appointments below the High Court.\nPart 4 of the Bill makes it a statutory requirement that treaties must be laid before both Houses of Parliament before ratification. If this House were then to vote against ratification the Government could not proceed to ratify it.\nWhilst this is obviously a matter for Parliament, the White Paper suggests that a valuable role could be played by committees of either or both Houses in the scrutiny of treaties prior to ratification. I should just say these proposals do not affect the current arrangements for EU and tax treaties which already have a statutory procedure attached to them.\nPart 5 of the Bill will for the first time put the Civil Service on a statutory footing by enshrining the core values of the Civil Service - impartiality, integrity, honest and objectivity - into law, as well as the historic principle of appointment"}

As proof, the 42-year-old pointed to a promised super-fight with Georges St-Pierre that was instead gifted to current UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping.\nSt-Pierre, who once dominated the welterweight division just like Silva dominated the middleweight division, has not fought since 2013, but it was recently announced he would be returning to the Octagon in a title fight against Bisping.

The madness crescendoed at the end of the third round when, with about 20 seconds left, Silva started to unload on Bisping. The Brazilian\u2019s laser-guided fists were so precise that the Brit\u2019s mouthpiece was ejected from his bloodied face, but instead of fighting on, he started to plead with the ref to get it back. That\u2019s when Silva leapt into the air and planted a flying knee directly into Bisping\u2019s maw.\nBisping\u2019s knees went limp as he sunk to the ground, Silva started to dance in celebration of his presumed victory, and the bell sounded to end the round. But the fight wasn\u2019t over, as the ref explained to a still dazed Bisping and a wildly exuberant Silva, who never recovered his composure.

I had chosen the name for my daughter a long time before I had even conceived her because I had seen it in a special book, and I loved it instantly. I chose this name because it was a very unusual Jewish name (at the time), and I knew no one else would have it (later it became very popular).\nMy heart sank. Why would she do this? There are so many names to choose from, so why would she choose my special name? And if she wanted my name, why wouldn\u2019t she at least ask me if it was OK\u2014out of respect?\nWoolsey waited a month and then wrote an email to Jessica in which she explained her feelings of disappointment. Jessica responded \u201chatefully.\u201d It\u2019s been three years, and they haven\u2019t spoken since.\nThis belief is ridiculous\u2014after all, liking a name doesn\u2019t give you ownership over it, and sharing a name with a friend or relative is, at worst, a mild nuisance. But the idea that names shouldn\u2019t be stolen is not surprising. Over the past hundred years, naming has increasingly become an act of self-expression for parents, a way to assert their individuality rather than a sense of belonging in their community. With our names and selves so thoroughly intertwined, it stands to reason that parents would become increasingly protective of their children\u2019s names.\nBut the desire for a unique baby name might not just be about finding a way to stand out, now that standing out is the thing to do. Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, the Freakonomics team, say that baby-naming is an aspirational process motivated by financial and professional hopes for one\u2019s child. Data shows that high-income, highly educated families are the name trend setters, and they seek out names that distinguish their children from the hoi polloi. Then the name \u201cstarts working its way down the socioeconomic ladder,\u201d until, eventually, it goes out of fashion. With this in mind, parents may, consciously or not, feel that when other people use their child\u2019s name, they are also in some way compromising the likelihood of that child\u2019s future success. Nevertheless, nobody\u2019s yet provided evidence that having a popular name might actually compromise a child\u2019s future.\nAs with so much of contemporary parenting, the drama surrounding name-stealing is ultimately more about the threat it poses to parent\u2019s identities than their children\u2019s. In practical terms, no child will be harmed by having the same name as a classmate or cousin.

Climate change features as a significant factor in the 500-page report, which evaluates 24 aspects of the bay and its larger watershed. The organizers intend to present a 28-page summary report of their findings in a news conference Monday.\n\"Narragansett Bay is one of Rhode Island's most important economic assets and the EPA won't let its scientists talk with local leaders to plan for its future. Whatever you think about climate change, this kind of collaboration should be a no-brainer,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement. \"Muzzling our leading scientists benefits no one.\" Whitehouse is scheduled to speak at the event.\nFor roughly six years, the EPA has provided about $600,000 annually for each of more than two dozen national estuaries, including the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, the conference's host.\nThe program's director, Tom Borden, said the head of the EPA's National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division in Narragansett informed him Friday that the keynote speaker, division research ecologist Autumn Oczkowski, and another colleague in the lab, Rose Martin, would not be able to make presentations at the event.\n\"I was not given a clear reason why,\" Borden said in an interview, adding that his team had worked closely with several of the agency's scientists on protecting and restoring the bay. \"It's a terrific partnership to have EPA working with us.\"\nAn EPA contractor who had contributed to two chapters of the report, Emily Shumchenia, was also told not to speak at the event. She and Martin were slated to take part in a panel titled \"The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change.\"\nBorden said the organizers invited Oczkowski and Martin because they were \"independent scientists\" who could offer valuable perspectives.\nAt least one senior regional EPA official is expected to attend the conference Monday; it is unclear whether the researchers previously scheduled to speak will go.\nThe estuary report, which was subject to extensive peer review and public comment, charts how Narragansett Bay is becoming cleaner but also faces challenges such as nutrient runoff and climate change.\nThe issue of the EPA's approach to climate-change science has become even more fraught since Donald Trump became president, as Administrator Scott Pruitt has questioned whether human activity ranks as a main driver of the warming the globe has experienced in recent decades. Political appointees have removed pages from the agency's website that address the issue and have canceled some grants supporting climate-change initiatives.\nRobinson Fulweiler, a Boston University ecosystems ecologist who has studied the effects of climate change on marine life, called the situation an \""}

Today\u2019s news headlines about the technology tend to focus on the extreme possibilities in being able to print objects on demand \u2013 from the terrors of things like a homemade 3D-printed gun to heartwarming tales of printed robotic hands for children born without fingers. But the innovation is also powering a revolution of a different kind. An emerging class of creatives are using 3D printing techniques, not to either save or destroy the world and the people in it, but simply to create a little beauty along the way.\nThese creatives, makers of the new \u201chandmade\u201d goods, are selling their art in online storefronts like Etsy and Shapeways, as well as within brick-and-mortar stores, and even museums.\nThey range from technically adept programmers who never dabbled in hands-on art involving paint or clay or other materials, to formally trained artists and even do-it-yourselfers who taught themselves 3D modeling by watching tutorials on YouTube.\nRegardless of how they got there, the end result is an output of affordably priced, print-on-demand goods that reflect their own unique vision and inspirations, whether that\u2019s a new kind of jewelry that couldn\u2019t exist before the capabilities introduced by 3D printing, one-of-a-kind items used to decorate your home, or objects which buyers help craft themselves, using simple online tools.\nThis is part one of an ongoing series which will showcase some of the art that\u2019s being fueled by the increasingly accessible 3D printing technology, and the artists behind the work.\nSummer Powell has always been an artist. She has both undergrad and graduate degrees in graphic design, and has worked on a number of products involving mixed media, vacuum forming, and lenticular technology, while exploring the intersection of art and technology in years past.\nAlong with a collaborator, she once produced a clock which used high-resolution animations to tell the time, for example.\nPowell says she first heard about 3D printing around 10 years ago and had been watching the space ever since waiting for it to become viable for use in her art.\n\u201cI had industrial designer friends in New York, and I\u2019d go see their prototyping 3D printing machines,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were making prototypes of consumer electronics and some furniture.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until a few years ago before Powell had the opportunity to begin playing around with 3D printing techniques herself.\nShe decided to pay a visit to Silicon Valley-based TechShop, one of the earlier \u201cmaker spaces,\u201d as these tool-filled workspaces are called.

{"idx": "9793", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: We pit the Apple rechargeable batteries against Duracell and Energizer.\nEditors' note: Thanks to a calculation error, the cost per minute of life for the Apple batteries had to be adjusted down to 8.25 cents after this story was posted. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\nLast year I posted a roundup of alkaline AA batteries and showed how they compared with each other in terms of battery life. The testing methodology I used last year, although only slightly complex, was very easy to implement. By turning on three identical flashlights, I drained two AA batteries from each of the three brands while recording the whole process with a Webcam.\nI then went back to the recorded video and pinpointed the time each flashlight died. Wash, rinse, and repeat two more times and there were my results. Like I said, easy.\nEasy, but perhaps not as satisfying as I'd hoped. A few users, thoughtful enough to comment, suggested some alternative tests. One of which was to use a point-and-shoot camera, set it to record video, and drain the batteries. Then check the video length of the recorded video to yield the battery life duration. So simple! This would even be easier and simpler than the flashlight tests.\nOne huge problem with that method, which we'll get to later.\nFirst, I contacted the folks at Canon, and they were more than willing to participate in my mad schemes. They sent their PowerShot SX130 IS camera. I had grand plans of inserting the batteries, hitting the record button, and coming back an hour or two later to find results, a golden egg, and possibly other imaginary treats. Here's where that aforementioned problem cropped up.\nAs many of you no doubt know, small digital cameras like this don't record video for more than 10 minutes before automatically shutting off. A dilemma for sure, and I'd love to regale you with a triumphant tale of how I immediately came up with an elegant solution. A win-win, not only for my time, but my sanity as well.\nNo. I guess I'm just not that creative. Instead, I rolled up the proverbial sleeves and took the pragmatic approach. I set a timer on my iPhone to 9 minutes and started it at the same time that I pressed record on the camera. After 9 minutes, my phone alarm would go off, reminding me to stop recording and almost immediately start recording again (usually within about 2 seconds). I then made note of the exact time I stopped recording and carried on ad nauseam.\nAnd by \"ad nauseam,\" I mean up to three times for each brand, using a different pair of batteries each time.\nSure, I now have a Pavlovian response to hearing my phone's alarm where I raise it above my head in preparation to smash it to the ground into (hopefully) a billion pieces, but it worked.\nSo that's the methodology. It's not nearly perfect, but it addresses some of the concerns from last year, in particular using a high-drain device and rechargeable batteries. My hope is that the results will give you at least some idea as to the potential life of the batteries featured.\nAlso, please note that although we used Duracell recharged batteries, we didn't test whether any of the brands discharged while sitting around. Hopefully next time we can actually plan for that.\nThe \"cost per minute of life\" (the price you pay for each minute of charge) was based on Amazon.com's current pricing."}

Eventually he was discovered serving as a lay brother in a Cistercian abbey in Switzerland and was convinced to return to Tarantaise and resume his episcopal duties.

{"idx": "9803", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: $455 million in new funding shows that SolarCity Corp can still get all of the funding it needs.\nOne of the biggest challenges SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ:SCTY.DL) has in remaining competitive in the residential solar industry is keeping the flow of money coming into the business. Funding solar systems is not only hard, it's necessary to simply stay in business.\nSolarCity also has high goals, attempting to finance over 100% of its installation costs each quarter (what it calls cash flow positive), so financing deals can be a big deal. And one announced earlier this week shows that those coffers are still open.\nOn Monday, SolarCity announced $345 million in new tax equity financing. That's about enough to fund a quarter's worth of solar systems, assuming that tax equity covers half of the cost of each solar installation. In some ways, this is business as usual, but it also gives SolarCity a few more months of operational funds as the company ponders the Tesla Motors buyout offer.\nThe other piece of the financing announcement was a $110 million expansion of the aggregation facility to $760 million. This is essentially a place where SolarCity can house solar systems before cash flows are sold off in securitization or cash equity packages.\nThis brings SolarCity's financing packages in 2016 up to $1.5 billion. That's a lot of funding for a residential solar company, but it's also necessary to keep SolarCity's operations funded. Apparently, banks and other investors haven't been scared off by the uncertainty the Tesla Motors offer brings.\nIf the first half of the year is any indication, financing isn't a problem for SolarCity. The challenge is finding enough customers to sign solar leases and keeping costs down -- and neither has been going well so far this year.\nSolarCity hasn't hit its own growth targets, which has made the company spread sales and administrative costs over a smaller base, resulting in the cost rises you see above.\nNo matter what happens to SolarCity in the rest of the year, financing doesn't appear to be a problem for the company. Given low interest rates and the desire for green investments, companies are willing to fund solar in larger numbers. That's a tailwind for SolarCity and will help the company amid other operational challenges.\nWhat investors will want to stay focused on is the flow of solar systems going through the business and where costs are trending. It appears to be harder to sell solar today than it is to finance it, which could be a major change in SolarCity's business long term.\nIPG Photonics Earnings: Can It Once Again Overcome the Trade War?"}

Not a bad set of relatives to have, considering Prince George is the future King of England.\nThe couple is staying at Il Pellicano, and the hotel\u2019s Instagram page boasts some jaw-dropping scenery, reported Elle. Beach chairs are set up in tiers along the blue-and-green waters for guests to enjoy some sunbathing, and the yellow-and-white striped towels in the Instagram pic are the exact same ones seen in the photo of pregnant Pippa. Other photos of the hotel show a beautifully manicured outdoor area with plenty of places to lounge, a pool, and of course spectacular views of the water.\nSources have said that Pippa and James are keeping things \u201cextremely low-key,\u201d which is certainly the best way to approach a babymoon. After all, her sister Kate Middleton and Prince William headed on their own babymoons when Kate was pregnant. During one of the babymoons, the couple opted to visit Mustique and stayed at an exclusive resort, described People.\nFor Pippa and James, the idea was to find someplace relaxing, beautiful, and of course private.\nWhen Pippa and James finish up their vacation, they may be heading back to their renovated home in west London. She was seen directing movers with a ton of new furniture that the couple ordered, including beds and even some decorative pieces, said Hello Magazine. It\u2019s likely that the whole family is getting more and more excited, considering that Pippa is reportedly due to give birth sometime in October."}

He and 20 other children were jumping into artistic activities through the five-day cultural program, which ends Friday.\nCity Arts is a camp designed to give children a taste of the fine arts in Allentown, said Lynn Berkowitz, curator of education for the Allentown Art Museum.

This gets them to think their part.\"\nThe children also listened to a speaker from The Morning Call and rehearsed a play created from their own suggestions.\nThey chose a story and a picture from Monday's newspaper and George Miller, artistic director of the Theatre Outlet, wrote a mock news broadcast about toys coming to life, a hip-hop museum and a magical cat.\nThe children got right into their parts, with one boy getting on all fours to be a toy horse with a rider. The resource room at the art museum resounded with neighs, giddyaps, baby cries, meows, woofs and laughter as the children practiced.\nAndrew Berkman, 8, of Allentown, who gleefully played the rider, said City Arts confirmed what he has known all along.\n\"I've always liked art,\" he said. \"I'll have to like it for the rest of my life, because it's too fun to stop.\".\nBefore they perform their plays and show off their artwork at the museum Friday afternoon, the children will make props and costumes out of newspapers, cardboard and bleach bottles.\n\"I have learned that you could use trash for art,\" Sean said while taking a break from his Superman duties.\nBut the program has meant much more for the young Coopersburg resident.\n\"When I'm in college, I might make some artistic things -- I'll use clay to make statues,\" he said. \"I got the idea from this camp.\"\nBerkowitz said the program showcases many different arts to appeal to as many children as possible.\nToday, the children will get a hands-on"}

Vincennes, while actively engaged with threatening Iranian surface units and protecting itself from what was concluded to be a hostile aircraft, shot down an Iranian airliner over the Strait of Hormuz.\nThe U.S. Government deeply regrets this incident.\nA full investigation will be conducted, but it is our judgment that based on the information currently available, the local commanders have sufficient reasons to believe their units were in jeopardy and they fired in self-defense.\nSubsequently, the Vincennes identified the Iranian firing units and closed to engage. The Iranian gunboats turned toward Vincennes at high speed and were engaged at 10:42 A.M. with gunfire from the cruiser and the frigate Elmer Montgomery.\nWhile so involved, the Vincennes detected an aircraft over Iran at about 10:47 A.M., again, local time. This aircraft headed toward the Vincennes and commenced closing at high speed. The Vincennes immediately began assessing this new threat.\nThe suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor. More importantly, the aircraft headed directly for Vincennes on a constant bearing at high speed, approximately 450 knots. A warning was sent on both military and civilian distress frequencies beginning at 10:49 A.M. This procedure was repeated several times, but the aircraft neither answered nor changed its course.\nGiven the threatening flight profile and the decreasing range, the aircraft was declared hostile at 10:51 A.M. local.\nAt 10:54 A.M., when the aircraft was about nine miles away, Vincennes fired two Standard surface-to-air missiles, at least one of which hit at an approximate range of six miles. Due to the limited visibility, the aircraft was not visually sighted until the missile impacted.\nIn understanding this incident, it is important to appreciate the total context in which our ships operate. The U.S. Government emphasized from the outset that committing military units to the Persian Gulf mission would involve risks and uncertainties. This conclusion has been reinforced by several incidents, for example the Bridgeton mining, the Stark tragedy and the Samuel B. Roberts mining.\nIn September 1987, as a result of the attack on the U.S.S. Stark and other incidents, the United States issued a notice to airmen, locally known as a NOTAM, which advised all aircraft in the Persian Gulf region that U.S. Navy ships were taking additional precautions, and of the need to identify themselves and to state their intentions.\nAdditionally, they were advised that failure to respond to requests for identification and intentions or to warnings and operating in a threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk by U.S. defensive measures.\nAs to the recent environment, we have alerted our forces to indications that Iranian units might attempt to carry out attacks against our forces over the July 4th holiday period.\nQ. Admiral, has there been contact with the Iranian Government, and if not, is any planned?\nA. There has not been direct contact, no. I think we will be awaiting the results of the SAR effort and any other indications.\nQ. Have any orders been issued to change the mode of our operations in the gulf?\nQ. Admiral, the Aegis cruiser is supposed to be one of the most sophisticated in the fleet in determining threat. How is it that it apparently misidentified this aircraft?\nA."}

{"idx": "9828", "prompt": "Continue the following text: You're a qualified candidate, and the job market is tough. But there could still be plenty of reasons you're getting passed over for every position you apply or interview for. A recent Glassdoor post reported that only 17 percent of hiring managers say job seekers have the skills they're actually looking for to fill their open positions.\n1. Lack of energy. If you're not clearly energetic and enthusiastic about the company or position, it will show in the interview. Having enthusiasm shows you're driven and have a desire to be active at all times, which is a quality that inherently makes you a good worker. No one wants to hire a passive candidate who complains or can't keep a good attitude, even when given the more mundane tasks. Remember, your energy level will show the second you walk in the door, so commit to being enthusiastic from the get-go.\n2. Inability to use free time. Hiring managers don't want to see a candidate who has no additional interests or personality beyond what's required to get a job in their industry. You need to show you're a human being, not a robot. Hiring managers love to see candidates with hobbies, or even those who have taken on a second job\u2014it shows you're able to make good use of your free time to expand your skills and interests, and this is a quality that's likely to spill over into your professional life.\n3. Procrastination. Recruiters want to be sure they're hiring someone who's punctual, and they'll shy away from anyone who doesn't demonstrate a clear ability to see things through to completion. Provide examples of times when you've wrapped up a big project, like writing an article or completing a design portfolio. Show that you're someone who spends your time well, and hiring managers will pick up on this as an indication that you'd put the same dedication into their company.\n4. Unpreparedness. If you show up at the interview without having a working knowledge of the company, what its mission is, what type of work it does, who its clients are, etc., do not think it won't show! Hiring managers will be able to tell from the get-go if you haven't done your homework and fully researched the company. Come armed with a few additional questions to ask at the end of the interview to show you're already engaged in the company's mission.\n5. Job hopping. If you've had tons of different positions in the last two years, or tend to leave a company after less than six months, this could signal you're flaky, difficult to work with, or at the very least, unsure of what it is you really want to do. That doesn't mean you need to lie on your resume - simply be honest with the hiring manager about what exactly has caused you to switch companies so many times. Reassure them that although you may have taken a while to figure out exactly what type of position or company culture you're looking for; there are still multiple instances in which you've demonstrated you're dependable, then provide concrete examples.\n6. Shaky online presence. Thirty-seven percent of hiring managers check candidates' social media sites these days, and the number is only growing. If you lack a solid online presence, this could show you don't pay attention to detail, aren't truly engaged in your industry, or at the very least, don't care about how others perceive you. Make sure you've got some sort of presence online, and that it's a positive one. Start a professional Twitter account or blog, and look into the specifics of how"}

His adoptive mother, Lynn Paddock, was later convicted of his murder. The case brought some mainstream attention -- including a 2006 Salon story -- to the popular, pervasive and controversial child \"training\" practices of Michael and Debi Pearl, which Lynn Paddock was said to have followed. The teachings of the Pearls and their Tennessee-based No Greater Joy ministry, which brought in $1.8 million last year in sales of books, DVDs and the like, are widely known and normalized across many conservative Christian churches and home-schooling communities. Perhaps the most popular of several ultra-conservative Christian figures to carry forward this centuries-old strain of Christian thought, the Pearls advocate a specific program of even-tempered, non-injurious corporal punishment, or \"chastisement,\" designed to bring about total obedience -- even by infants -- to their sovereign parents. (The Pearls' ministry and principles are described in greater depth, and broader context, here.) By no means do the Pearls advocate suffocation with blankets; they are emphatically against \"abuse.\" But they do not spare the rod. From their Web site: A length of quarter-inch plumbing supply line is a \"real attention-getter.\"\nThis month, another child has died: 7-year-old Lydia Schatz, an apparent victim of repeated beating with -- as it turns out -- quarter-inch plumbing supply line. Her parents, Kevin and Elizabeth Schatz of Paradise, Calif., who reportedly called 911 to report that she was not breathing, stand charged with her murder. They are expected to enter a plea on Thursday. According to the authorities, forceful and numerous whippings, apparently with plumbing line, may have caused tissue breakdown so massive that Lydia's vital organs could no longer function. The Schatzes also face torture and abuse charges for significant injuries sustained by Lydia's also-adopted sister Zariah, 11, who was hospitalized in critical condition, as well as for extensive bruising on a 10-year-old biological son. (The Schatzes have six biological children and three adopted from Liberia.) Though the remaining children showed no visible signs of abuse, they told police they'd been \"disciplined\" with the tubing as well. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told Salon that the Schatzes had explicitly described to police their adherence to the Pearls' philosophy, which, as one of many horrified anti-Pearl bloggers within the conservative Christian community observes -- recalling precisely what prompted the Schatzes' call to 911 -- includes the admonition that a proper spanking leaves a child \"without breath to complain.\"\nIt's one thing for those of us outside the fundamentalist Christian/Christian home-schooling world to point fingers at the Pearls and voice outrage at their methods. What really matters, and what stands to have actual impact, is the outrage inside the Pearls' world. And right now, more than ever, an anti-Pearl movement within the conservative Christian community is rising up in heated, if sometimes whispered, fury. Some say -- even pray -- that Lydia Schatz's death will bring Michael and Debi Pearl exactly the kind of attention they deserve.\n\"I think many in the Christian and/or home-school community wanted to see Sean Paddock as an 'extreme'"}

They described their work at a meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Portland, Ore.\nDiscovered in an academic archive in the former East Germany, the elaborately bound volume of gold and green brocade paper holds 75,000 characters, a perplexing mix of mysterious symbols and Roman letters. The name comes from one of only two non-coded inscriptions in the document.\nKevin Knight, a computer scientist at the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California, collaborated with Beata Megyesi and Christiane Schaefer of Uppsala University in Sweden to decipher the first 16 pages. They turn out to be a detailed description of a ritual from a secret society that apparently had a fascination with eye surgery and ophthalmology.\nUncertain of the original language, the researchers went down several blind alleys before following their hunches. First, they assumed the Roman characters and not the abstract symbols contained all of the information.\nBut when that approach failed, they figured that the code was what cryptographers call a homophonic cipher \u2014 a substitution code that does not have a straightforward correspondence between the original and encoded information. And they decided the original language was probably German.\nEventually they concluded that the Roman letters were so-called nulls, meant to mislead the code breaker, and that the letters represented spaces between words made up of elaborate symbols. Another crucial discovery was that a colon indicated the doubling of the previous consonant.\nThe researchers used language-translation techniques like expected word frequency to guess what a symbol might equal in German.\n\u201cIt turned out that we can apply a lot those techniques to code breaking,\u201d Dr. Knight said.\nThe work is being praised by other experts. \u201cCracking the Copiale Cipher was a neat bit of work by Kevin Knight and his collaborators,\u201d said Nick Pelling, a British software designer and a security specialist who maintains Cipher Mysteries, a cryptography news blog.\nBut while the cipher was a notable success, Dr. Knight and his colleagues have been frustrated by other, more impenetrable ciphers.\n\u201cThere are these books and ancient languages of real historical value that contain historical information that we just can\u2019t get out yet, and that\u2019s of interest to a lot of people,\u201d he said in a filmed interview describing the Copiale project.\nThe work has value to historians who are trying to understand the spread of political ideas. Secret societies were all the rage in the 18th century, Dr. Knight said, and they had an influence on both the American and French Revolutions. He recently shared the decoded Copiale text with Andreas Onnerfors, a historian at Lund University in Sweden and an expert on secret societies.\nModern examples of challenging ciphers include the communications the Zodiac killer sent to the police in California in the 1960s and \u201970s, and the \u201cKryptos\u201d sculpture, commissioned for the C.I.A. headquarters, which has been only partly decoded."}

Wes Breckenridge, D-Newton, enters his second term serving Iowa House District 29, and his first term as an assistant minority leader of Iowa House Democrats, the Newton politician\u2019s priorities are fixated on a sustainable health care system, stable mental health services and boosting the economy through a skilled workforce.\nLeading into the 2019 legislative session, Breckenridge is looking at the efficiency of specific programs and smart spending of public tax dollars in some of the more talked about and widespread concerns in the state, in addition to addressing supplementary or ongoing issues raised by his constituents.\nBuilding and maintaining quality-yet-affordable health care for Iowans continues to be a concern for Breckenridge, who frequently criticized the privatization of Iowa\u2019s Medicaid program throughout his 2018 campaign.\nHealth care changes, Breckenridge said, impact everyone\u2019s lives \u201ceither directly or indirectly.\u201d Following the state\u2019s decision to allow private companies to manage the $5 billion program, Breckenridge cited inadequate reimbursements for services, denial of claims and a lack of funding to health care providers \u201cthat could potentially lead them to not providing services or maybe even lose (clinics or doctors) in an area\u201d of the state.\n\u201cYou take Skiff (Medical Center) here in town. I bet if you visited with them they would tell you about the thousands of claims that have been denied or rejected that Medicaid claims for extensive amount of dollars that they have probably not been paid, which raises the cost of health care (and) makes it tougher for (Skiff) to provide all the same gamut of services that they normally provide,\u201d Breckenridge said in Dec. 19 interview.\nSmall clinic providers in Jasper County, Breckenridge said, have also been \u201cstruggling to keep their doors open\u201d after the privatization shift. Admittedly, \u201cthere\u2019s no easy answer,\u201d he added, but the challenge legislators have is keeping individuals from being denied or prevented from getting the care they need. Looking at the problem from \u201ca more holistic approach\u201d is a strategy Breckenridge wants to implement moving forward.\nIn regards to the access to mental health services in Iowa, Breckenridge touts Jasper County as a model for the rest of the state. Frequent visits to places like Optimae Life Services, Progress Industries, Capstone Behavioral Healthcare and Integrated Treatment Services, LLC have convinced the Newton Democrat the local agencies \u201cprovide a very valuable service for our citizens in a time of need.\u201d However, if Iowans continue to have \u201cdeclining reimbursement rates (and medical) transportation costs,\u201d Breckenridge questions how mental health providers are going to maintain those same services to help citizens.\n\u201cI am very proud of the team we have in Jasper County (and) the work that they\u2019ve done and continue to do,\u201d Breckenridge said.\nAlthough he acknowledges funding is and will likely always be a major component to providing quality mental health services, Breckenridge said looking at what efficiencies can be put in place and eliminating any redundancies are just as important factors \u2014 anything to make sure public tax dollars are not going to waste.\nWeeks after the 2018 midterm election, Gov.

So did his 50th and 100th career goals, while yesterday\u2019s hat-trick took him past the 150 mark in all competitions for United.\nIn the process, he became the club\u2019s leading scorer in the Premier League era with 107, going past Ruud van Nistelrooy. And it would have been four but for the woodwork.\nBefore the game, Gary Neville had revealed how, in the past, United used to set out to bully Arsenal. Yesterday, the Gunners were so weak, physically and mentally, United did not have to lift a finger in intimidation. Their opponents simply surrendered.\nThe first goal set the tone,with Danny Welbeck shrugging off Johan Djourou\u2019s weak challenge to head home Anderson\u2019s lofted pass.\nAnd weak was the word to describe Robin van Persie\u2019s penalty, given when Jonny Evans tugged Theo Walcott.\nOnce David de Gea had guessed the right way to dive, he only had to fall on the ball.\nAshley Young punished Arsenal with the first of his two superbly struck goals before Welbeck\u2019s flying start to the season was brought to an end by a hamstring injury that will keep him out for club and country for several weeks.\nAnderson made keeper Wojciech Szczesny laugh by making faces at him as he lined up his wall for a free-kick. But he was not laughing when Rooney curled a shot into the top corner.\nDe Gea blotted his copybook again by letting Walcott\u2019s shot through his legs in added time at the end of the first half.\nBut he redeemed himself by denying Van Persie a goal with a great save, while Andrey Arshavin wasted a good chance.\nBut United were opening up their opponents and Rooney added his second and United\u2019s fourth in the 63rd minute with an identical goal to his first.\nThen Rooney supplied the pass for Nani to chip home the fifth. Substitute Ji-Sung Park scored the sixth from Young\u2019s pass before Van Persie volleyed a goal that was not even a consolation.\nAnd it got worse for Arsenal.

If he's to be believed throughout the record, the rapper and producer born Thebe Neruda Kgositsile has mostly been dealing with a breakup, smoking weed, fighting with Xanax and lying real, real low.

On the new record he\u2019s not hiding his grumpiness: \u201cI\u2019ve been like this since the Motorola Razr.\u201d Considering he's just 21, that's more than half his life.\nThis is a different brand of darkness, though. Filled with barbs at former friends and verse-long defenses of his culpability in a recent breakup, Earl's portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man reads as a kind of poetically executed tirade at both the world and himself, one tempered by his acknowledged good fortune.\n\"Good grief, I've been reaping what I sow,\" he raps on \"Grief,\" the first single. \"I ain't been outside in a minute / I been living what I wrote.\" All he sees out there are snakes \u2013 \"mama taught me how to read 'em when I look\" \u2013 so he's staying in. He characterizes his grandmother's death as when she \"drank the mud.\"\nThis relentless insight, consistently sharp skills as a writer and casually crucial delivery are key reasons why Earl's been so doted upon by both the hip-hop cognoscenti and fans of the written word. Yes, his back story is fascinating, but even without it his fans would be clamoring for new work.\nAny excitement accrued after his remarkable rise as a teenage member of the Odd Future hip-hop collective and son of accomplished parents, one a law professor, the other an admired South African poet and political activist, seems long gone. Lyrically black and gray with the occasional \"crimson leak\" of blood (and lots of marijuana green), the album has a Nick Drake-quality overcast patina.\nWithin these sparse, Rothko-esque works the artist dedicates deep, unflinching energy to documenting and hopefully exorcising his woes (or at least understanding them), delivering lines with wondrous cadence, zipping with a singsong musicality that illuminates what surrounds it. \"Lately I've been panicking a lot \u2013 feel like I'm stranded in a mob,\" he raps in \"Grief.\" \"Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop / Never getting out of hand, steady, handling my job.\"\nEven his BMW is colorless"}

To replace the headset jack, Apple is allegedly working closely with their audio chip partner Cirrus Logic while looking to create a multipurpose Lightning slot in the headset jack\u2019s wake. By removing the 3.5 mm jack, Apple will be able to cut the thickness of the iPhone 7 by one millimeter, or 0.04 inches.\nAccording to a source who spoke to Fast Company, the Lightning port will serve a number of purposes, including the option to add Lightning-connected earphones and headsets to customers.\nHowever, for those who don\u2019t want to shell out the cash for new Lightning port-connected earbuds, the iPhone 7 will likely include an adapter that will allow users to use their old 3.5 mm headsets.

{"idx": "9850", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: It was a year yesterday since my debut novel In the Name of Our Father was published. This \u2018novelist\u2019 journey is largely tied like a Siamese twin to my journalism career, which kicked off some twenty years ago with The Source magazine published by Comfort Obi and Maik Nwosu, the author of Invisible Chapter, Alpha Song and A Gecko\u2019s Farewell.\nWhile working with The Source, the magazine had a section called Night Diary. It was meant for reporters to share their night experiences. Occasionally, outsiders were allowed to contribute. One of such outside contributions was about a pastor who joined the occult to acquire powers to perform miracles and attract people to his church. When I read the piece, I felt I could do a novel out of it. This was in 2002. Nwosu, my editor then, had published Invisible Chapter and Alpha Song, which made a large impression on me.\nAt a point, I also felt that if the story was based alone on the pastor, it would be too ordinary. I decided to do a story-within-a-story. I was clear about what I wanted to do. So, I decided to do a prologue to introduce the narrator of the story-within-the-story before going into the main story.\nIt occurred to me early that people could get confused by the shift from the prologue to the main story, but I took care of it by making it clear in the last line of the prologue that what would follow was reading from a book. Any reader who glosses over the prologue or misses this last line may be confused. But I am glad most people have been able to understand what I set out to do. I also made sure the link between the story-within-the-story and the narrator\u2019s challenges were well established at the end of the book and this, according to readers, was a rude shock they did not see coming.\nAs an apostle of art for relevance, almost every single work of art I have done, be it poetry or prose, has had a critical message for the society. This has been with me right from my days at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism, where some of my poems were featured in a collection called \u2018Activist Poets\u2019. This principle was on my mind when the principal script of In the name of Our Father was written while I was 24.\nOne question that has kept cropping up since the book was released is whether or not I was conscious of the backlog it could have. The truth is: I never bothered about whether or not anyone would feel bad about what I was writing. I felt only the guilty should be afraid.\nI have also been asked what research went into conceptualising my major characters. For Prophet T.C. Jeremiah, I had to extra-study the Bible so as to get the necessary scriptures to use. I also read interviews and stories on cases of false prophets. I also read tons of reports and interviews about victims of incarceration during the last military dictatorship. The prison break in the book was so real that Hon. Wale Oshun, who had witnessed one while in prison, sent me a mail asking if I experienced it. Of course, I did not. It was pure research. Almost all the characters who were jailed in the book have real-life personalities they are modelled after. This was deliberate because I want the book, in a way, to be a blend of fact and fiction, which is known in some quarters as \u2018faction\u2019.\nFor Justus Omoeko, who I modelled after Mr Kunle Ajib"}

They need only captain Ron Vlaar to shake off his calf injury and their relegation battle will have a huge boost.\nVilla made the early strides and looked more penetrative for N\u2019Zogbia\u2019s return. He ran at the Tractor Boys at every opportunity from his advanced role in the midfield three, just behind Bent.\nBent\u2019s attack down the right set up Villa\u2019s first opening but Jordan Bowery\u2019s outstretched boot could not direct the ball goalwards.\nBowery had a clearer opportunity from Bent\u2019s flick on the half-hour. He was one on one with the keeper but his left-foot shot was well saved low down by Loach.\nThat cost Villa as Ipswich took the lead 30 seconds later, when Michael Chopra\u2019s cross-shot from the right seemed goal-bound but defender Lichaj got the final touch.\nIpswich had Loach to thank again in the 38th minute, when his spectacular diving stop to his left denied Ciaran Clark\u2019s bullet header from Barry Bannan\u2019s corner. But Ipswich\u2019s advantage at the break was enough for the Villa fans to boo their under-fire team off the pitch, even though they were a little unlucky to go in behind.\nHowever, the fans weren\u2019t on Villa\u2019s back for long as Bent levelled just 38 seconds into the second half.\nN\u2019Zogbia controlled a through ball from Bannan and beautifully fed the on-rushing Bent, whose first-time shot went in at the far post. It was his first goal since September 30, largely due to injury and being out of favour with Lambert.\nBent had joined Ipswich as a 14-year-old, going on to net 48 times for them in the league.\nIpswich boss Mick McCarthy said of Bent\u2019s strike: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have \u00a324m of quality. He\u2019s a good finisher.\nVilla pressed for the lead on the hour, when Bent\u2019s shot from 20 yards was well saved by the impressive Loach.\nIpswich almost went ahead against the run of play in the 80th minute through substitute Aaron McLean. Aaron Cresswell\u2019s looping ball over the top was met first time by McLean, and it took a great reflex save by veteran keeper Shay Given to keep Villa level.\nVilla went 2-1 up three minutes later through substitute Weimann\u2019s glancing header.

I\u2019m aware of Fatima and Guadalupe and Lourdes, and find them somewhat interesting, but they don\u2019t form a significant part of my daily spirituality. Thus, I have no particular dog in the fight over the apparitions in Medjugorge; but this week\u2019s statement about Medjugorge from the CDF (i.e., don\u2019t assume the apparitions are real) led me to reflect on obedience and humility, which I regard as perhaps the most important touchstones for the behavior of living \u201csaints\u201d.\nBy \u201cobedience\u201d in this case, I mean obedience to duly constituted religious authority: to one\u2019s superiors in a religious order, and to the local bishop. Padre Pio, for example, spent years pretty much confined to his cell at the order of superiors who thought he was a fake. He took it quietly; and when he was vindicated he went quietly back to hearing confessions. Well, I say \u201cquietly\u201d; I gather he sometimes had a lot to say to penitents who weren\u2019t truly penitent.\nWhen St. Juan Diego told his story to the bishop in Guadalupe he was met with disbelief. He went on quietly, and was vindicated a day or so later. St. Bernadette went through very hard times before her story was accepted, and went on to live and die an obedient nun. St. Catherine of Siena famously persuaded the pope to bring the papacy back to Rome from Avignon, but did so with the utmost respect and without criticizing the pope to others (although that particular pope is certainly open to criticism).\nSo when I hear about present day private revelations, to the extent I\u2019m interested at all, I look first at the behavior of the person receiving the revelation. Are they obedient to the church authorities? Are they living a life of humility, or are they exalting themselves before others? And, of course, are their revelations consistent with the teaching of the Church? Next I\u2019d look at the fruit: is the revelation leading devotees into obedience and humility, or into dissent?\nI think the most important lesson of Medjugorge is to not be eager to jump on the bandwagon of a new apparition. It\u2019s not fatal if you do, and the apparition is proven false; true devotion to Christ and his Blessed Mother is always reward, I feel sure. But a too eager devotion can lead you astray, and then official disapproval can cause significant pain and disappointment. Why go there?"}

But without congressional support, those pledges fizzled. President Obama is trying regulation, instead.\nPresident Obama attended the plenary session of the international climate conference Monday, just outside Paris. By using regulations instead of treaties, Obama hopes to continue to cut U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases.\nFor more than 20 years, world leaders have been trying to craft a solution to global warming, without a lot of success. During that time, the U.S. government has been like the big-ticket movie star who has been offered the lead role, but won't commit.\nPresident Obama, though, thinks he has figured how the United States can once again star, even without the support of the U.S. Congress.\nWhen the world's first climate treaty was signed in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, then-President Bill Clinton held an airport press conference to brag that the U.S. \"showed the way\" to make that happen. \"I am very pleased that the United States has reached a truly historic agreement with other nations of the world to take unprecedented steps to address the global problem of climate change,\" Clinton said at the time. \"The agreement is environmentally strong, and economically sound.\"\nBut months later, the U.S. Senate said it wouldn't ratify that treaty, even if the rest of the industrialized world did. From then on, the U.S. didn't have skin in the game \u2014 and everyone else knew that.\nPresident George W. Bush agreed with the Senate decision. But he did say climate change was a problem, and one the U.S. should do something about. Speaking in 2007, Bush said, \"I put our nation on a path to slow, stop and eventually reverse the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions.\"\nBush didn't think those changes should come via a United Nations treaty. Rather than deal with the U.N., his approach was to suggest a target for U.S. emissions and encourage private companies to invent new technologies to meet it.\nWhen President Obama took office, he was eager to get the U.S. government to lead the world in the control of emissions. He had a \"national climate action plan\" to reduce emissions in the U.S., and, he said, the U.S. would return to the world stage.\nAfter addressing delegates at the U.N. climate conference this week, Obama told reporters, \"Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard ... but I'm convinced that we're going to get big things done here.\"\nIn 2009, he put in a personal appearance at the climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. But that ended in disappointment; nations failed to agree on a new climate treaty. That same year, a climate action bill he supported died in Congress \u2014 one of several pieces of climate legislation to fizzle there.\nRepublicans, especially, had doubts about the legislation Obama wanted. At a hearing on the bill, Rep. Ed Whitfield of Kentucky spoke for many of the doubters. \"The way that this bill affects our production of electricity, and the production of the fuel we use in America, may very well dwarf the climate change problem,\" Whitfield said.\nOthers just didn't believe what scientists were saying about the threat of climate change.

But, look to the following week's list, and the tally should be flush with major sales -- and major stars.\nOn June 17, we'll see the retail arrivals of three albums that are all tentatively forecast by industry sources to sell over 100,000 in their first week: Lana Del Rey's \"Ultraviolence,\" Sam Smith's \"In the Lonely Hour\" and Linkin Park's \"The Hunting Party.\"\nLana Del Rey's 'Ultraviolence' Poll: What's Your Favorite New Song?\nLana Del Rey's \"Ultraviolence\" leads the debut pack, with industry sources suggesting it could sell over 175,000 copies in the week ending June 22. It's Del Rey's second full-length album for Polydor/Interscope Records and is aiming to be her first chart-topper.\nDel Rey's debut, \"Born To Die,\" bowed and peaked at No. 2 with 77,000 sold in the week ending Feb. 5, 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It surpassed 1 million in total U.S. sales in March, and its cumulative sum stands at 1.06 million.\nSmith might move over 150,000 with his debut album -- though forecasters caution that figure could go higher. Linkin Park's early estimate stands at 100,000 to 125,000.\nYou may wonder: How can industry sources forecast first-week sales for an album before it has come out? Sales projections are based on a number of indicators. They include orders from physical retailers, pre-orders on digital services like iTunes, first-week performance of comparable albums, media exposure, radio and YouTube trends for the album's singles, and so on. Depending on how far out we are from an album's release, a forecast can be wildly different from the final outcome. In general, you can best guess an album's debut sales week once it's actually on sale.\nSmith is currently blowing up the Billboard Hot 100 with his album's single \"Stay With Me,\" which hit the top 10 for the first time on the chart dated June 21 (vaulting 19-10).

He\u2019d serve in both posts until a new commissioner is named. It is a terrible idea.\nThis is no criticism of Kautter, who has a strong resume as tax policy expert with years on Capitol Hill and as a tax practitioner. But choosing him to temporarily replace retiring IRS Commissioner John Koskinen while keeping his Treasury post is a mistake. He might be able to do either job well but he can\u2019t do both.\nCapacity. You may have noticed that Treasury is in the midst of an effort to write a major tax bill. The assistant secretary for tax policy should be playing a key role in that initiative, working with Congress to draft legislation and advocating for Administration priorities. And for many months, it will be a more than a full-time job. Yet Kautter is being asked to do that and run the IRS, another highly challenging post. If a tax bill slips into next year, a highly-probable result, and Trump can\u2019t get a permanent commissioner confirmed, Kautter would have to both shepherd a major tax cut and manage a tax filing season. It is impossible to do both well.\nContrasting roles. The IRS Commissioner and the assistant secretary serve very different functions. The Commissioner is charged with administering the tax law as it is. The assistant secretary\u2019s job is to determine what the law should be. These two perspectives can create a healthy tension that results in better law. But for the roles to complement one another, they should be fully independent.\nThe IRS needs a permanent commissioner. The agency faces enormous challenges. Its staff morale is poor, its technology is lagging, it faces near-constant political criticism, and it is desperately short of money. Trump has been talking about replacing Koskinen since long before election day and it is no surprise that the post will be vacant when Koskinen\u2019s term expires in three weeks. Yet the White House is unprepared to name a replacement.\nThere have been acting commissioners in the past, but they are nearly always top IRS career officials who serve for a relatively brief time. And the Treasury says that two current deputy commissioners will run the day-to-day operations at the IRS. But the agency needs a top manager, an effective advocate with Congress, and a visible public face. Even in the best of circumstances, a part-time temp can\u2019t serve all these roles.\nThe perception of politics. The IRS must\u2026must\u2026be perceived as non-political. Republicans, of course, have been complaining for years about the Service\u2019s alleged bias. Yet, Trump is taking someone who is already serving in a highly political policy job and giving him the IRS post. The dual roles will inevitably raise serious questions about the independence of the IRS.\nThere is, I suppose, one benefit to Kautter serving dual roles. It will be easy for the IRS commissioner to convince the assistant secretary of the importance of tax administration in developing a new tax law. But other than that, Kautter has an important job that fits his skill set well\u2014advising the White House on the design of a tax bill. Adding the IRS to his portfolio does an injustice to both him and the country."}

As they begin planning and implementing their vision for this region, I want to ask: What kind of a community can we create together?\nIf I were to seek a vision for the community some residents want, judging from numerous commentaries published on these pages as well as from reactions to those commentaries, I would say the only thing they want for sure is to maintain the primacy of their automobiles (and the parking to accommodate them). They for sure do not want protected bike lanes, investments in mass transit, high-density housing, and safe and walkable sidewalks.\nBut we cannot create flourishing communities by propping up a car-centric world.\nRelying solely only on automobiles for our transportation needs limits our ability to see faces, empathize and make connections with one another. Driving requires tunnel vision to make snap decisions while navigating, and any speed over 15 miles per hour hampers our recognition abilities.\nThis lack of contact and recognition causes us to be more suspicious of one another. Walking, biking and sharing space on public transit, by contrast, cause us to be more trusting, more hopeful and more empathetic with one another, because we see each other face-to-face; we see the scars and wounds we carry on our bodies; we hear the joy and distress in our voices; and we see our humanity reflected in one another. One cannot experience this while driving in a sealed, climate-controlled aluminum box.\nAs the passenger pleaded for assistance the other day, the bus driver looked at me and asked if I would be willing to help. I was. As we positioned ourselves on the sidewalk, the passenger asked us to be gentle, mindful of artificial knees. The driver and I wedged our feet underneath the rider\u2019s, gripped a hand and an elbow, then lifted with all our might.\nAfter becoming vertical, the passenger embraced me in a bear hug and said, \u201cDo not let go till I get settled.\u201d I held on tight. Once sure footing and equilibrium were established, the passenger thanked us for our help and walked toward home.\nIf I had been driving my car (a Dodge van; I\u2019m not anti-auto), I would have not seen this incident. But if I had been walking by, or riding in the bike lane, I would have (just as I did aboard public transit).\nWe all like to think we are autonomous, able to take care of ourselves, thank you very much. We can temporarily place ourselves in transporting protected pods going to and fro. But this is an illusion. We are all connected and in need of one another.\nI return to my question: What kind of community can we create together? I hope elected officials and concerned citizens will join me in helping to create a community where, if I fall down on the ice (or your grandmother falls down), someone will see, and help. Or if I\u2019m in pain, someone will at least acknowledge me rather than driving by, oblivious.\nAnd what better way to help create that kind of community than walking, biking and taking public transit? When you walk, you employ your two doctors, your right and left legs. When you bike, you\u2019ll find all the free parking you can imagine. When you ride public transit, you don\u2019t have to warm up your car or scrap the ice off the windshield.\n"}

It's not a platform where things go viral, which was the power that Russian operatives allegedly took advantage of to inflame American political tensions during the election.

Plus, Facebook's reputation among users is tied in part to the user's relationships to others using the platform, which the company has less control over. Google declined to comment on the record.\nYes, but: Google's weakest point in the investigation is YouTube, where Russian operatives allegedly supported vloggers pushing anti-Hillary Clinton messages. YouTube also has a relationship with the Kremlin-backed outlet Russia Today \u2014 meaning the company makes money off of Russian state content.\nThe pressure could ramp up as more comes out about that relationship, including a deep dive from the New York Times into the topic and a spot on the issue this week on the Today Show.\nBehind the scenes: Despite its low public profile over the past few months, Google's army of lobbyists has been active behind the scenes. For example, Google has also been lobbying on a bill that would put new disclosure requirements on online political ads.

We will let those facts speak for themselves.\"\nFocusing the disappointment of one session on one legislator may seem a bit much but EPL points out that Klein put himself in a very powerful position by making a deal with Senate Republicans. \"We had high hopes leading in to 2013 that bipartisan leadership would break the legislative logjam that has stalled so many environmental initiatives in the State Senate,\" said Dave Gahl, executive director of EPL/Environmental Advocates. \"But during 2013, Senator Klein led the State Senate in the wrong direction while becoming a new obstacle to environmental progress. We hope that receiving the Oil Slick award will be the wakeup call that Senator Klein needs to be the leader he promised.\"\nThe group also issued its scorecard for the rest of the Legislature. Republican Sens. Dean Skelos, and Mark Grisanti also scored 42 points. Assemblyman Robert Sweeney earned an \"Honorable Mention\" for being a strong leader on environmental bills with the caveat that no legislator received the 2013 legislator of the year award."}
{"idx": "9868", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: By Jace Frederick / St. Paul Pioneer Press on Apr 15, 2019 at 4:14 p.m.\nMINNEAPOLIS -- Josh Okogie noted one big difference between the start of his rookie season and the end of it last Saturday in Denver.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little more sore, I can tell you that,\u201d Okogie said.\nCall those growing pains. The Timberwolves\u2019 first-round pick experienced plenty of growth this season, developing as a defender, play-maker and decision-maker over the course of his first NBA campaign.\nMost who watched him would agree, a positive for a franchise that hopes to grow into a consistent contender. The fact that Minnesota had two such rookies, both of whom appear capable of playing in NBA rotations for the foreseeable future, is reason for optimism.\nDon\u2019t forget about Keita Bates-Diop.\nOkogie was the first-round pick who, thanks to a sudden trade request and major injury, spent much of the season in the starting lineup. He played in 72 games, including each of the Wolves\u2019 final 58, and earned a spot in the Rising Stars Challenge at the all-star break.\nOkogie was tasked with guarding some of the NBA\u2019s best wings and, for the most part, answered the call. He famously limited James Harden during the reigning MVP\u2019s trip to Target Center and challenged the likes of Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook.\nThey came for Bates-Diop, too, but later. The wing spent much of the season\u2019s first half in the G-League, playing 16 games with the Iowa Wolves. When he was in Minnesota, he was initially glued to the bench. But he used that time wisely by studying teammates such as Luol Deng and Dario Saric.\nWith injuries to Robert Covington and Deng came increased opportunities for Bates-Diop. The Big Ten Player of the year as a junior at Ohio State stuck in the Timberwolves\u2019 rotation by doing much of what he did with the Buckeyes, serving as one of the team\u2019s better perimeter defenders and doing all of the little things offensively.\nOkogie started to make his mark late in the season. In one 10-game stretch, he averaged 12.6 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.7 steals while shooting 48 percent from the floor and 34 percent from 3-point range after plowing his way through the proverbial rookie wall.\nAt first something of a bull in a China shop, flying around 100 mph, he evolved into a player who takes his time to read the game and react to what\u2019s unfolding in front of him.\nBates-Diop clearly feels the same. Where does his confidence stand heading into the offseason?\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty high right now,\u201d he said."}

They also took different amounts from my other colleagues. They asked for my mobile phone but I told them I didn\u2019t have a mobile [phone].

I cannot deny that soldiers are involved because one of the criminals we arrested was our soldier from the Tiger unit [presidential guards],\u201d Malek said.\nThe military official was responding to Miraya FM radio which reported another incident of robbery occurred over the weekend in which seven armed men attacked and looted several households in the city.\nA resident said they were \u201cterrorised\u201d while watching movies inside their respective houses.\n\u201cThey entered the verandah where we were watching movies and then they started telling us to get out from the house.

{"idx": "9871", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There\u2019s a disconnect between shoppers and gift recipients this holiday season. According to a survey conducted for the National Retail Federation, consumers plan to spend less on gift cards this year compared to last year. However, gift cards top holiday wish lists for the ninth year in a row, making them the most popular present for U.S. adults.\nWhat gives? The survey suggests shoppers are finding gifts earlier and for better prices this year, making the gift card less necessary. However, gift cards are the procrastinator\u2019s go-to gift and there\u2019s still plenty of time to fulfill wish lists. To help cut the cost of this season\u2019s hottest present, consider these tips.\nBuy in bulk from warehouse stores.\nWarehouse clubs like Costco and Sam\u2019s Club sell bulk gift cards to retailers and restaurants at discounts of up to 30% off. This is a great way to save money and knock several people off your gift list. For example, Costco offers a four-pack of $25 e-gift cards to Coldstone Creamery for $69.99, or four $25 gift cards to MovieTickets.com (redeemable at AMC, Regal Cinemas and Carmike Cinemas) for $79.99.\nBuy discount gift cards and e-gift card codes.\nConsumers who are not warehouse club members can find discounts on gift cards and e-gift cards through GiftCardGranny.com. You can save anywhere from 5% to over 25% on cards to retailers, restaurants, entertainment venues like movie theaters, and even travel companies like airlines and gas stations. Check the return policy of the reseller you work with to ensure you can get your money back if the card balance isn\u2019t as advertised when you receive it.\nLook for free gift cards with purchase.\nBlack Friday weekend featured several doorbusters that included a free gift card with purchase. If you scored a doorbuster and gift card, consider re-gifting the card to reduce your holiday expenses. Read the fine print first since some of these promotional gift cards are more like coupons, featuring restrictions and expiry dates. Gift card offers are still available on select products from Target, Walmart, Best Buy and even Starbucks, so click on the \u201cFree Gifts\u201d filter on store pages at CouponSherpa.com to find out which products will get you a free gift card.\nTrade in gadgets for gift cards.\nTrade-in programs from Walmart, Target and Best Buy offer gift cards in exchange for old gadgets. If you have any used smartphones, tablets, video games, consoles and the like collecting dust, now is a great time to exchange them for store gift cards which you can offer as a gift to someone on your list.\nRedeem credit card rewards for gift cards.\nAll those credit card rewards you\u2019ve accrued this year can be redeemed for gift cards. Some banks even offer discounts on select cards, so peruse that list before you redeem to get more money from your rewards. If you have 20,000 points accrued, you can get eight $25 gift cards which will likely reduce your gift list significantly without any extra cost to you!\nCheck daily deal sites for half-off certificates.\nSites like Groupon and LivingSocial are basically providers of discount gift certificates. Since presenting a printed voucher on Christmas morning may feel underwhelming, pair the voucher with a related product. For example, if you purchase a daily deal for a manicure, present"}
{"idx": "9872", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: What are the options available for businesses to divert their food waste from the landfill? Maureen Howard talks to one Dunedin enterprise that isn't waiting for a kerbside collection scheme.\nBy connecting trees with cafes, \"we're just trying to solve that issue of making sure organic waste doesn't end up in landfill\", says Isaac Davies, co-owner of the social enterprise Doubt Not.\nDoubt Not is coming to the rescue of cafes, restaurants and coffee roasteries across Dunedin. Begun mid last year and growing by two to three cafes per week, the business now takes uncooked food waste from 34 businesses in the hospitality industry. Davies and co-owner Pete Ryan are determined to keep as much food waste as they can out of Dunedin's landfills - and to use the compost generated to grow trees and other plants. There is no charge to participating businesses; instead \"we are trying to supplement it by starting a tree industry from the compost\", Davies says.\nDavies and Ryan started Doubt Not with the goal of increasing their compost supply for trees they are growing to sell as part of the One Billion Trees Programme. They have focused on the hospitality industry because they know the extent of the food-waste problem there. Both men work full time in hospitality and have done so for the past 10-15 years.\nOne cafe that benefits from Doubt Not is Heritage Coffee, a cafe and eatery in the warehouse precinct in Dunedin.\n\"It's going really, really well actually. There is not much waste going in the rubbish bin anymore because anything that can be recycled gets recycled,\" staff member Bethany Bates says.\nDoubt Not takes more than just uncooked food waste. To balance the high nitrogen from the food waste, it also incorporates carbon in the form of paper, cardboard packaging and coffee husks into the compost pile. Even its trees are propagated in containers obtained from the waste of the businesses it serves. Coffee bags, cups, salad containers: \"Nothing we use is a bought product. Everything we use is a waste product,\" Davies says.\nDoubt Not is a fine example of recycle and reuse, but - as the mantra goes - reduce is the first priority. Catherine Irvine, senior strategy and policy officer at the Dunedin City Council, recommends that businesses initially start at the \"front end\" and do an in-house audit by weighing how much food they are wasting.\n\"I've worked with businesses in the past where they have done that and they have just not realised that they were just purchasing too much and making their serving size too big. Once you've measured it you know what you are dealing with.\"\nAudit done, Irvine recommends initiatives such as Doubt Not and Kiwi Harvest, which rescues good-quality food waste for people in need, as well as the Love Food Hate Waste website, for information.\nUnder the Waste Futures banner, the DCC has recently initiated a review process to consider introducing kerbside collection of household organic waste.\nIt is too soon to say whether business food waste will be included, Irvine says.\nAlong with grassroots enterprises such as Doubt Not, the council's Waste Futures projects aspire to reduce Dunedin's waste to landfill to as close to zero as possible. Public submissions will be called for on the proposed kerbside waste collection service later this year.\n\"We are going to go out loud when we have some options to put in front of people,\" Irvine"}

The result is a band of China advocates throughout Europe whose positions range from urging closer economic and governmental cooperation with Beijing to air-brushing over China\u2019s human rights record.\n[\u2026] \u201cFrom a friendly partner, in a few years it changed to an unfriendly competitor,\u201d [Jo] Leinen said of China. He cited industrial policy as well as human rights violations including the detention of Muslim minority Uighurs for the \u201crougher tone\u201d from the EU. \u201cChina has lost the battle in the U.S. and is on the way to losing the battle in Europe,\u201d he said.\nEurope has become more vocal in its criticism of China of late, calling the country a partner as well as an economic competitor and a \u201csystemic rival\u201d on governance. Concerns are mounting over China\u2019s growing influence, predatory investments and possible hacking of 5G data networks.\nThe EU has also been divided over China\u2019s Belt and Road infrastructure project, which some see as a threat to sovereignty. Italy\u2019s populist government last month signed on to the initiative, brushing off the concerns.\nAs next week\u2019s EU-China summit approaches, Europe has begun to fundamentally rethink its China policies. The shift is so substantial than even seasoned Asia hands have described it as a \u201crevolution.\u201d Despite differences among the EU member states, the overall thrust of the change is in convergence with the new U.S. approach. As recently as three years ago, member states resisted even modest changes to strengthen EU trade defense instruments, despite the flood of Chinese steel imports. The notion of an EU-level mechanism to scrutinize Chinese investments was still anathema to most European leaders. If the United States in early 2016 had suggested closer coordination in restricting Chinese access to Western technologies, a common public front on China\u2019s non-market practices, or cooperation on infrastructure financing as a counterbalance to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), European allies would have responded with a bemused rebuff.\nQuestions about whether and to what extent alliance members should allow Chinese network supplier Huawei to operate in their countries, along with Italy\u2019s move to join Beijing\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, have put the question of how NATO should respond to the Asian power front and center.\nIt\u2019s a fraught issue for much of Europe, which, like the U.S., has deep commercial ties with China.\nA year later, the mood had already changed. Politicians and officials were starting to hear alarm bells coming from German industry. Those actually dealing with Chinese companies could see the writing on the wall: China had used trade and economic links with Western partners to upgrade its own manufacturing processes. German companies were starting to feel the heat as their technological edge evaporated and they lost contracts to major Chinese competitors.G"}

He could not have imagined the modern proliferation and complexity of laws, or how subversive this is of the rule of law.\nSuch a subversion will confront Congress when it reconvenes. Congress is nimble at evading responsibilities but cannot avoid deciding either to repudiate or to tolerate a residue of President Obama\u2019s lawlessness, one that most, perhaps all, congressional Democrats and many, perhaps most, Republicans want Obama\u2019s successor to continue.\nThe Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) requires insurance companies to insure people with \u201cpre-existing conditions,\u201d a locution minted to avoid the awkward candor of saying, in most cases, \u201cpeople who are already sick.\u201d The individual mandate, requiring people to purchase insurance, is one way the ACA subsidizes insurance companies that are mandated to engage in money-losing undertakings.\nThe subsidy that Congress must confront in September is the ACA requirement that the secretary of health and human services devise a program to compensate insurers for the cost of selling discounted plans to some low-income purchasers. Obama\u2019s HHS secretary created a program to disperse billions of dollars to insurers to defray the costs of the low-income purchasers who are more than half the ACA enrollees.\nThe Constitution says: \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\u201d Nevertheless, the Obama administration spent the money for the insurance subsidies, breezily arguing that it was being faithful to something higher than the Constitution \u2014 the ACA\u2019s text. Or its logic. Or something. Republican members of the House (including Georgia\u2019s Tom Price, who now is secretary of HHS) sued to stop the payments. In May 2016, a federal judge said they were right on the merits but stayed the decision to allow the Obama administration to appeal.\nDonald Trump has exceeded Obama\u2019s executive willfulness, which at least strove for a patina of implausible legality. Last month, Trump said that, absent Republican success in replacing the ACA, he might end the payments \u201cvery soon.\u201d Clearly, he thinks either spending or not spending unappropriated billions is a presidential prerogative."}

{"idx": "9892", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Despite some issues with its structure and choice of focus, Like Crazy is yet and still one of the best modern day love stories to come along in the last few years.\nIn Like Crazy, director Drake Doremus attempts to chronicle the struggle of one young couple's romance - a love they try to preserve across the span of years, geographic distance, as well as through personal and professional changes. The film posits a simple question: Can something as sincere and bright and fragile as true love survive the tortuous road of life?\nAnna (Felicity Jones) is a bright and fiery young writer in her last year of college in Los Angeles. It's there that she meets Jacob (Anton Yelchin), a quiet and shy young carpenter studying furniture design. Modern times being what they are it's Anna who makes the first move, writing a love letter to Jacob inviting him out on a date, where the two find they have an instant, undeniable and passionate connection. Their love is carefree and strong until reality inevitably intervenes: after graduation Anna's student visa will expire, and she'll be forced to return home to London. The thought of separating tears at both young lovers' hearts, until Anna makes a bold decision: she'll ignore the mandates of her visa and instead spend a joyous summer in Jacob's arms.\nThe summer couldn't be happier for the couple, and when Anna finally returns to London, it's on the assumption that it will only be brief absence. However, the powers that be don't take the issue of visa violation lightly, and Anna and Jacob soon find themselves in a nightmare of immigration laws and bureaucratic entanglements, as they fight desperately to stay connected with one another. This battle for love spans several years as Anna and Jacob both grow and change and come together and drift apart - try to find love elsewhere only to struggle with the inescapable magnetism of true love.\nLike Crazy is bolstered by the fantastic performances of its two young leads. The chemistry between Jones and Yelchin is understated, yet nonetheless powerful and engaging to watch. The pair communicate volumes of thought and emotion in the simplest looks, gestures, and smiles; the connection between Anna and Jacob feels genuine and organic and almost always logical in the way it develops and turns. Of the pair, it's Jones who stands out the most, playing a nicely updated version of the damsel in love; the film as a whole offers us characters who are refreshingly modern spins on classic romance movie gender roles and tropes. This is a very timely love story.\nHowever, while the characters themselves are strong points, the pacing and story structure of Like Crazy (co-written by Doremus' and his frequent collaborator, Ben York Jones), is likely to be off-putting to some viewers. The film is an exploration of specific moments over the course of a long and winding relationship; the jumps in time between one scene and another can be a bit jarring, even though Doremus does try to transition the viewer smoothly via technical tricks like montage or sped-up footage. Still, there are several points in the film where one intimate or emotionally intense scene gives way to a new time and completely new circumstances for the characters, and Doremus and Jones are not always successful in preserving the narrative or thematic through-lines they want the viewer to follow.\nThese interruptions are especially noticeable in the storylines for supporting characters like Samantha (Jennifer Lawrence) and Simon (Charlie Bewley) - two people that Jacob and Anna respectively become entangled with as they struggle with their own relationship"}

Its leaders - by backing the Federal Marriage Amendment in the last decade and now the Arizona law in this - are essentially saying that they do not understand how these measures could impact a minority's collective psyche. Whatever the technical merits of either measure - and there were intellectually coherent (if, to my mind, unpersuasive) defenses of both - the lack of empathy or understanding is the real issue. It places the Republican \"us\" against the minority \"them.\" This is not just a failure of empathy; it is failure of judgment.

As my colleague Sarah Kessler pointed out last month, brain training companies like Lumosity aim to help you achieve that better brain. But underneath the promises of enhanced cognition, another thought occupies many people\u2019s minds: Could keeping \u201cmentally fit\u201d today ward off the devastation of dementia in later years?\nLast month, a group of 69 brain researchers from various institutions got together to pen an admonishing open letter on brain training from the Stanford Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development. They warned against one-off experiments from researchers with financial interests in brain training products, and noted that much more research would be needed to make some of the conclusions that brain training companies were selling.\nThis past week, a group of researchers from the University of Sydney\u2019s Brain and Mind Research Institute issued something of a follow-up response. Publishing a large review of 52 brain training studies in Plos Medicine, Amit Lampit, Harry Hallock, and Michael Valenzuela found that there wasn\u2019t much to support the idea that playing brain training games alone on your computer could sharpen your noggin. But it wasn\u2019t all bad news. The researchers did discover, however, that brain training in groups\u2013like at a \u201cbrain gym\u201d with a trained supervisor\u2013showed encouraging results.\nBut what\u2019s the difference between playing brain games in a group and playing them on your phone on the way to work? Valenzuela says that people who play brain games alone could just be gravitating toward the type of exercises they\u2019re already good at. On the other side, the social environment of a brain gym can be motivational, and the same goes for a trained supervisor.\nHis explanation doesn\u2019t sound too different from what the merits of a gym membership would be versus buying a Bowflex machine spotted on late night TV. And, similar to rigorous physical training, the Sydney researchers\u2019 analysis also showed that brain training every day proved ineffective. Training more than three times a week showed worse results.\nAt the same time, Valenzuela warns that neither of these methods has proved sufficient to keep dementia at bay."}

We have hit a bit of a cold patch and have stumbled through our last couple of games. This, however, does not mean we are going to roll up into a ball and let our competition walk all over us for the rest of the year. Our club has the ability to do great things this season; we just haven't proven it yet.\nOne way to defend our 2-4 record is to say that we have played four state-ranked opponents so far this season, two of them gracing the top five in their divisions. The way I choose to approach it is that we have played only two periods of sufficient hockey in all of the games we have failed to win. Yes, we have played very good competition, but we have also executed poorly for bits of each game. The more talented teams on our schedule will take advantage of our shortcomings every time.\nThe big idea that Coach Wilkinson is preaching is executing our duties out on the ice and trusting our teammates to do their jobs. I would have to say that we are getting closer to obtaining each of those statuses every time we step out onto the ice. At this point in the year the season is still very young and adjustments can be made by the coaching staff and players to better ourselves as a team. The good news is that we are willing to bend to our coach's expectations to make our season the best it can be. Guys like Steve Needham and Matt Elswick are perfect examples of our team's adaptability. Elswick is traditionally a forward and has been practicing at defense, whereas Needham is a defenseman but has stepped up and taken a role as a third-line forward.\nOur next stretch of games is not any easier than the one we just completed, but I believe that we have gained the necessary experience and have learned a couple lessons that will make us more successful in the long run. With a game at the Soo and a home rematch with Traverse City West on tap for this week, we hope to raise our record to an even 4-4 and build up from there. On a different note, I would like to extend a huge thank-you to all the volunteers that made our D-3 Challenge such a great event; we set a standard for high school showcases that is very hard to reach.

Avidly searching for spices and the fabled gold of the Inca empire, the conquistadors were not aware of the future value of their new possession - the land. Nor could they have been as impressed with the dry, smog-free, sunny, climate as were a group of food writers from the United States and Canada visiting Chile last month.\n\"For centuries the lush and fertile valleys, the hours of sunshine, have been ideal for growing many different horticultural species,\" says Rosario Valdez, food writer of Paula Cucina, a Chilean magazine. \"In northern Chile's desert there are places where no drop of rain has ever fallen,\" she says. \"And in the south there are regions where rain falls almost every day. There are fertile valleys in between, and one area called the lake district looks like Switzerland.\"\nThe story of Chilean cuisine follows history's imprint. The invading Spanish found the tough, warlike Araucanian Indians, who resisted conquest and extermination. The result was a blending of Indian and Spanish foods, with a diet mostly of seafood, fruit, corn, beans, and squash.\nPreconquest Indians lacked ingredients such as milk, butter, and cheese. Meat was scarce except among ruling classes. The Indians had no eggs from chickens; ducks and wild birds were rare luxuries. History records that they were quick to adopt some of the crops and animals brought by the Spanish, accepting foods and cooking techniques when they fitted the Indians' way of life.\n\"The Indians have clung with amazing tenacity to their ancient customs, creating a Creole [regional] cuisine from the early cooking,\" explained food writer Valdez at an interview in Santiago, Chile's capital. \"Many of the indigenous foods such as corn, beans, potatoes, and certain fruits, are still used in everyday cooking, as well as in traditional holiday dishes.\"\nChilean dishes are not peppery hot. There are local favorites such as empanadas, which are meat turnovers; humitas, a grated fresh-corn mixture steamed in corn husks; picaron, a fried pumpkin batter like a doughnut; and locro, a meat dish with potatoes.\nAt Los Lingues, a large adobe hacienda at San Fernando, 75 miles outside Santiago, our group had a rare glimpse of upper-echelon Chilean hospitality. Now a guest house and working farm, the home of German Claro Lira and his wife Maria Elena Lyon Claro has passed down through Mr. Claro's family since the land grant in 1545.\n\"I run Los Lingues as if it were my home,\" says Mrs. Claro, whose menu included such Chilean country foods as her own recipe for Pastel de Choclo, a traditional and delicious casserole of corn niblets, corn meal, hard-boiled eggs, raisins, seasoned beef, and chicken.

{"idx": "9920", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The good news first: Those headlines screaming that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will run out of money soon are flawed.\nThe FDIC may be short on cash. According to its Web site (www.fdic.gov), it indeed had \"extraordinary losses stemming from write downs\" totaling $3.6 billion, and during the second quarter, the fund balance declined \"from $13 billion to $10.4 billion.\" That number was derived at by subtracting liabilities from $64.8 billion in cash and other assets. Obviously, this leaves the agency less room to maneuver on its own while confronting, as of last count, 416 banks on the \"problem list.\"\nHowever, Congress earlier this year gave the FDIC authority to borrow up to $500 billion from the Treasury, if needed. Furthermore, although there is some debate whether there exists a statutory guarantee by the United States government for all of its commitments, it would be politically unthinkable to not have taxpayers serve as a stop-gap for any losses larger than that amount; should that unlikely scenario ever materialize.\nIn the meantime, the FDIC will attempt to bolster its balance sheets by increasing the fees that banks pay to carry the coveted \"Member FDIC\" label as well as by courting additional buyers for troubled banks. Just this week, its board voted 4 to 1 on regulatory changes intended to create interest among private equity firms (\"hedge funds\") in bidding for the assets of distressed lenders.\nThe fee increases will likely be unwelcome to the 202 out of 324 financial institutions in the state of Georgia listed on the FDIC's Web site that reported a net loss in the second quarter. Even less welcome to smaller community banks, however, will be another troubling development connected to government guarantees.\nAs it turns out, the recent massive intervention by the federal government that was designed to ensure the survival of \"too big to fail\" financial institutions has had an insidious effect on competition. Many of the saved behemoths of banking have become still larger as a result of the bailout.\nTheir market share has increased either because of the demise of smaller rivals or the purchase of failing competitors (often backed by government guarantees and sometimes explicitly pushed for by regulators). In some cases, the government even waived antitrust rules to enable certain acquisitions.\nConsequently, common measures of industry concentration now point to more market power being wielded by the largest financial institutions. Ironically, that makes them even more indispensable on the \"too big to fail\" scale. But even without imminent failures, this is becoming a problem. Market leaders are enjoying a historically large advantage over regional and midsize banks when it comes to borrowing money on capital markets because of the, now, more-than-just-implicit guarantee that taxpayers will step in rather than letting them go under.\nSo, the two-faced Janus of government intervention is raising its ugly head. Deposit insurance provided by the government has been a success in making fearsome bank-runs a thing of the past and in enabling smaller players to enter the market. However, other government guarantees for ever bigger market leaders are now more often than not preventing smaller banks from competing on a level playing field.\nWhat one hand of the government giveth, the other taketh away - and that really is bad news."}

They often exist in highly politicized urban districts where decision-making is fractious and policy-makers prioritize other goals above the intellectual, social and emotional needs of students. In this setting, most teachers will work hard just to survive; they will quickly leave for places where they have a higher likelihood of thriving.\nTeachers in urban schools daily encounter students who are under-prepared, students who appear to be uninterested in their own development and future, contentious relationships between school personnel and families/community members, etc. Having neither a nuanced understanding of the historical and political factors that produced \"a\" above, nor a deep appreciation of identity formation, multiculturalism and diversity, teachers can easily frame these serious issues as the result of individual deficits and defects, shaped by family dysfunctions rather than as expressions of the basic inequities, inequalities and power dynamics of a post-industrial, capitalist economy. With these assumptions in play, many teachers in high poverty urban schools struggle to develop relationships with their students and to respect, understand, empathize with and/or believe in them. When these connections are not present, teachers will seek them elsewhere.\nWork on the pipeline of new teachers: create robust, articulated pathways between urban schools (middle and high schools especially) and undergraduate and teacher preparation programs. These sectors need to be in continual dialogue so that they are mutually supporting. We need more graduates of urban schools - from all cultural and language groups - returning to teach in them.

They didn\u2019t call 911 when their twins struggled after a home birth. At their sentencing Monday in Clackamas County Circuit Court, the Mitchells each received six years and eight months in prison and renounced their once-held belief in prayer alone.\nAdding weight to their declaration was a third signature, that of Walter \u201cMatt\u201d White, a patriarch of the church. He\u2019s the father of Sarah Mitchell and the son of the late Walter White, who began the Oregon City church in the 1930s.\nAs part of the Mitchells' plea deal, the document must be posted in the 1,000-member church for all to see.\n\u201cOur hope is that this is the tipping point -- the point where things turn around and people are given the excuse to do what they need to do, what they want to do,\u201d said Bryan Brock, one of the Clackamas County deputy district attorneys who prosecuted the Mitchells.\nIn the past decade, Brock\u2019s office has filed charges against the parents of four deceased children for medical neglect.\nThe extraordinary public shift by the founder\u2019s family illuminates a divide that has grown in the church for years, say both those inside and outside the community. Some church members have quietly but regularly sought medical intervention when needed.\nOthers have wanted to do the same but have felt peer pressure from a core group that believes seeing a doctor represents a weakness in faith. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the scorn,\u201d Brock said, and so follow the strict line.\nThe core group believes that anointing the ill with olive oil and praying is the best and only course of action.\nThe questions now are: Have the Mitchells had a true change of heart? And why would Walter \u201cMatt\u201d White sign the statement after a lifetime of believing so strongly in faith-based healing?\nNo one contacted from the church by The Oregonian/OregonLive is talking.\nCalls to the church\u2019s phone remained unanswered and people at the church and White\u2019s home declined comment. The church also hasn\u2019t had a designated leader since its founder died in 1969. Sarah and Travis Mitchell\u2019s attorneys -- Steve Houze, Jacob Houze and Jason Thompson -- also declined to comment.\nFaith healing appears to be on the decline nationwide, said Rita Swan, whose toddler son died of meningitis in 1977 in Michigan after she embraced faith healing.

Sure, Trump didn't like the coverage he was receiving in the Washington Post, which Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns. But even just judging by the latest holiday sales numbers, Amazon so decisively dominates online shopping that other retail giants can barely compete. If Trump decided to make good on his promise, should Bezos be worried?\nAmazon\u2019s dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism\u2019s grand tradition.\nIf success alone were against the law, then yes. Online sales covering these five days amounted to nearly $13 billion. That\u2019s 15 percent more than the same period one year ago, according to Adobe Digital Insights. On Black Friday, online shoppers using mobile devices spent more than $1 billion in a day\u2014a first. Meanwhile, the share of retail dollars spent online is growing at the fastest rate ever. Since by some estimates Amazon accounts for half of all online shopping, all these trends certainly mean nothing but good things for Bezos' balance sheet\u2014both now and for the foreseeable future.\n\"Once again, Amazon is best positioned to take advantage of the shifts,\" says Jason Goldberg, vice president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish.\nThe question is whether that advantage becomes too much of an advantage\u2014if Amazon's success tilts into something more nefarious that blocks healthy competition. So far, experts say Amazon's dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism's grand tradition. But it may be on the verge of becoming the kind of monopoly that Trump's top techie, Peter Thiel, says all companies should strive to be: \"the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.\"\nNo other retailer looks close to becoming an Amazon substitute yet. A few intrepid retailers, including Walmart and Target, are certainly trying to compete, but they're still so far behind. Amazon scored $79 billion in online sales last year. Walmart came in a far-distant second at $13.5 billion. That\u2019s not a gap; it\u2019s a chasm.\nAmazon's advantage would seem to come from doing just what Thiel describes: seizing its market opportunity first (it started selling books online in 1995) and doing online shopping better. Thanks to its first-mover advantage and some serious foresight, the company has already built a vast network of fulfillment centers that span the globe. It hires and knows how to deploy hundreds of thousands of seasonal workers. It simply enjoys a logistical superiority that it's extending into its own trucks, cargo planes, and drones. On the front end, it\u2019s even opening bookstores and grocery stores that can double as distribution centers in their own right while venturing into the last remaining territory its key competitors still dominate: offline shopping.\nAnother problem would-be Amazon rivals face stems from shoppers' increasing preference to browse for products on their phones. Despite this predilection, browsers still become buyers less than half the time on smartphones as they do on desktop computers. Once again, however, Amazon is the exception, or at least the farthest ahead.\n\u201cAmazon has far less of a mobile gap than any other retailer\u2014largely driven by the fact that 24"}

A private comment has the potential to go viral as a Facebook post or Twitter feed. For every message, there is likely to be an accomplice, a bystander, an eavesdropper, a reporter, a promoter, an influencer, a detractor... It\u2019s not about social media, it\u2019s about heightened social messaging consumption.\nIn this background, there are opportunities for corporate communications to enlist the power of wider involvement to maximise impact.

The phrase stood for the very function of the company\u2019s products which, as additives to mortar and cement, gave buildings and infrastructure the longevity they deserved. In addition to being a compelling product usage proposition, the line was also reflective of the spirit of corporate partnership with clients (especially government and real estate enterprises). Last, but certainly not the least, the tagline cued the nurturing of employee aspirations, protecting and building of their careers. For the average employee however, \u2018Future-proofing what you build\u2019 wasn\u2019t self-explanatory.\nTo get them to understand the concept, a company-wide workshop needed to be conducted around the understanding of corporate values and how the tagline fitted into the scheme of things. At the end of this workshop, employees were given the task of explaining the concept of Future-proofing to their children or members of their younger generation at home, and have them interpret the \u2018Future-proofing\u2019 thought in their own context. Having done that, these children were encouraged to submit a painting or drawing reflecting what they visualised as part of a company-wide contest. In time, the entries which came in were truly inspiring. Children depicted environmental future-proofing (cleanliness, pollution, eco-friendly, saving water) to traffic safety, children protection and animal protection... The best twelve went onto the company\u2019s widely distributed corporate calendar, and a large poster consolidating the entries adorned the reception areas of all branch offices.\ni) You can choose to induct an indirect target group (children) into a corporate programme, if their participation makes the most critical target group (current employees) more responsible and involved.\nii) A seemingly complex or elevated concept can become simplified through co-creation. The children\u2019s ability, even if aided by their elders, to interpret and contextualise from their own perspective, allowed the idea to generate greater power and relevance.\niii) A corporate philosophy, when marrying a product proposition as well as a social message, can be flexibly and widely used across audience groups and situations. Sponsorships of eco-friendly CSR endeavours sat extremely well for this company.\niv) A good idea can make the maximum impact if you prepare the ground well for the detonation."}

Its receiving sensitivity is much greater than similar components produced by other companies and allows for transmission ranges of up to 1 meter, the company said.\n\"It is the first time such a highly sensitive terahertz band receiver has been made small enough to fit into a current-generation cellular phone,\" a Fujitsu spokesman said via email.\nIn 2011, Japanese component maker Rohm Semiconductor developed an experimental wireless chip operating in the 300 GHz range and handling data at 1.5Gbps. It measured 1.5mm by 3mm.\nWhile its range is very limited, the Fujitsu receiver would allow for massive file transfers when used with dedicated kiosks. That could justify the cubic centimeter of real estate that might be required on a smartphone.\nFor instance, Fujitsu envisions the technology being used in train station kiosks to instantly receive videos and music to smartphones. Rapid transfers between mobile devices or quickly backing up device content on a server would also be possible.\nThe receiver uses a polyimide for the printed-circuit substrate to minimize signal loss. It is combined with a mounting technology used in millimeter-wave band collision-avoidance radar chips. Fujitsu said the design expands the applicable frequencies into the terahertz band for the first time.\nThe terahertz band, which is found between the microwave and infrared regions of the spectrum, has been the focus of research for wireless capacity that could be used with data for 4K and 8K imagery as well as high-res audio.\nThough limited in range, terahertz-frequency signals can penetrate paper, plastic, walls and the outer layers of skin, opening up possibilities for security and medical applications.\nFujitsu is presenting its research this week at European Microwave Week (EuMW) in Paris. It plans to conduct field trials before April with an eye to commercialization in 2020."}

PAUL, Minn. - Niklas Backstrom is so determined to succeed, so disciplined in his focus that upon learning of his first all-star selection last week he expressed relief the news was delivered on a day without a game.\nThe Minnesota Wild goalie didn't want to be distracted.\nBackstrom isn't outwardly bothered by much, not even the fact the team has not addressed his contract, which expires at the end of the season.\nWith a 2.16 goals against average that ranks fourth in the NHL, five shutouts (only Steve Mason of Columbus has more) and 36 starts in Minnesota's 43 games, Backstrom has set himself up for a big payday when he becomes a free agent in July.\n\"Obviously it's going to be a goaltender-friendly team, a defensive system, but there are nights when we need him,\" Wild assistant coach Bob Mason said. \"We need our goalies early. We need our goalies late. ... I don't care who you're playing. You don't know what you're going to see, so your preparation has got to be solid.\"\nBackstrom has that part down. His work ethic and dedication are widely praised in the organization, which signed him in 2006 out of Finland as fill-in. Dwayne Roloson, himself an all-star in 2004, was traded earlier that year to make Manny Fernandez the main man in the net.\nAssistant general manager Tom Thompson received a strong recommendation on Backstrom from scout Matti Vaisanen.\n\"To be honest, I was watching other guys in the game, and a 27-year-old goalie at the time wasn't high on my priority list,\" Thompson said. \"It turned out great. He grew into his body and developed later than most guys.\"\nThe plan was to have Backstrom, then 28 without a minute of playing experience for a team outside of northern Europe, split time as the backup with another rookie, Josh Harding. They'd be able to go up and down from Minnesota to the minors without clearing waivers.\nBut Harding hurt his groin during training camp, and Backstrom was on the roster for opening day. About 3 1/2 months into his first season, Fernandez went down with a knee injury and suddenly this stone-faced, soft-spoken goalie his teammates had barely heard of before the year was turning away shot after shot and leading the Wild to the playoffs.\nTwo seasons later, he's heading to the all-star game, next weekend in Montreal.\n\"I just tried to make the team and be part of the team,\" Backstrom said. \"That was the biggest goal. You know when you get there, you want to be better. You want to raise the bar. You want to improve.\"\nThis inner drive is an inherent trait.\n\"That's a big part of what I learned from both parents,\" said Backstrom, who still summers in Helsinki. \"It's also in the Finnish culture. They're proud of being hardworking people. That's for sure something you learn at home.\"\nBackstrom was an unknown in scouting circles until the 2004-05 season, when NHL stars went back to their native countries during the lockout and significantly upgraded the competition in the European leagues. That's when Backstrom began to believe in his ability to play with the best, and look at his options for coming to North America.\n\""}

(Reuters) - People don\u2019t talk about trade tariffs in this stretch of the Mississippi River basin, where grains and metals have paid the bills for generations.\nThey skirt the subject at church fundraisers and sidestep it at Jerry\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Quick Stop, where farmers and aluminum workers gossip about everything else.\nHere, the winners and losers in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war live side-by-side.\nThe Republican president\u2019s tariffs on imported metals were instrumental in reviving an aluminum plant that most locals had written off for dead. But in the fields surrounding the plant and across the county, farmers anxious over trade retaliations against U.S. crop exports are delaying equipment purchases, renting their land to hunters and pre-selling crops before harvest - locking in today\u2019s prices for fear they will fall.\nFarmers\u2019 fears were realized Friday as the United States and China levied dueling tariffs on $34 billion worth of each country\u2019s goods. Many U.S. agricultural exports, including soybeans, now face 25 percent duties.\nNeil Priggel knows both sides of the trade war\u2019s impact on his community. He worked at the Noranda Aluminum smelter before it went belly-up in 2016 and also runs his family\u2019s 4,000-acre farm along with two brothers.\nAs Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs in March, Priggel stared at the TV news and thought: We\u2019re saved. We\u2019ll get our jobs back.\nHis very next thought: We\u2019ve got to protect the farm.\nPriggel and other farmers here, where about 70 percent of voters supported Trump, know their crops are obvious targets for countries striking back against U.S. tariffs. They also know the tax on metal imports helped lure new owners to reopen the plant that has long financed their neighbors\u2019 mortgages, truck payments and groceries.\nKathee Brown worked at Noranda for three decades. She returned in March a one-person human resources division for what\u2019s now called Magnitude 7 Metals. Her phone rings constantly.\nIs it true the plant is coming back?\nDid you get my application?\nAt her dusty office desk, its drawers still full of old invoices, she checks her voicemail \u2013 full, again. Many callers are former plant workers; sometimes they break into tears when she calls back.\nThe plant\u2019s new owners plan to hire 465 people, for now.\nMore than double that number have applied.\nGetting the smelter back was a long shot, locals say, just like getting a high-paying factory to this rural corner of Missouri in the first place. When it was built in 1969, they named its site for the patron saint of lost causes: the St. Jude Industrial Park.\nWorkers rode out years of aluminum price drops, labor strikes, recessions and fights with electricity suppliers. The company would cut shifts, lay off workers, then hire them back, workers say.\nBut the plant closed in early 2016 after a series of crippling blows: global aluminum prices plunged; a New York private equity fund heaped on $1 billion in debt in a leveraged buyout; an explosion disabled the plant\u2019s cast house; a power-outage shut two production lines.\nAbout 1,000 people had to go find jobs, often at much lower pay, said Mark Baker, a farmer and presiding"}

The race was then put on a red flag status for nearly two hours before the official announcement was made by series CEO Randy Bernard regarding Wheldon's passing.\nWheldon helped develop the new 2012 IndyCar which had improved safety features as well as the return of Chevrolet into the series.

{"idx": "9962", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The percentage of a country's population that is employed full time for an employer -- which Gallup refers to as having a \"good job\" -- is one of the most fundamental statistics of productivity, the engine that drives both economic growth and development. The world desperately needs more jobs like these that give people a measure of security and allow them to plan for the long term rather than eke out a living in subsistence-level jobs.\nGallup's new State of the Global Workplace report, which features a wealth of recent data on the workforces around the world, shows that across 155 countries, 32% of adults between the ages of 23 and 65 have these good jobs. However, this figure varies widely from country to country, ranging from a low of 5% in Niger to a high of 72% in the United Arab Emirates.\nThis relatively simple measure is a useful barometer of social and economic conditions in a country. To begin with, it's a good indicator of economic development. Formal employment opportunities are more common and diversified in more developed countries than in less developed ones. That's because human capital -- the skills, knowledge and talents within a population -- is more fully developed and used more efficiently in areas with many employers of different sizes and in different industries.\nConsequently, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita -- or productivity -- also have more residents who are employed full time for employers.\nBeyond sheer productivity, Gallup's \"good jobs\" measure gauges economic inclusiveness. Comparing the results for working-age men and women, for example, offers a look at how traditional gender roles may affect levels of full-time employment. Globally, working-age men are almost twice as likely as women to work full time for employers -- 42% vs. 23%, respectively. But the gender gaps are widest in South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa region, where low percentages of women with good jobs depress the total number of residents employed full time for an employer.\n*Within each region, results are weighted proportionally by population size in each country.\nLarge gender gaps in full-time employment are particularly common in countries in the Middle East and North Africa, where societal pressures limit women's labor force participation. In many of these, however, public opinion is at odds with such restrictions. A 2016 study on women and work by Gallup and the International Labour Organization (ILO) found that 57% of men and 67% of women in Arab States feel it is acceptable for women in their families to have paid jobs outside the home.\nWomen in other countries around the world feel these pressures as well. In Japan, two-thirds of working-age men (67%) work full time for an employer vs. slightly more than one-third of women (35%). Businesses in Japan often demand that workers prioritize their employers over their personal lives. Women's traditional roles as mothers and homemakers make it particularly difficult to compete with men under such demanding conditions.\nIn a few countries, the labor market has adapted to make women's lower \"good jobs\" rate less problematic. The Netherlands, which has one of the largest gender gaps in the world, is one example. One in four working-age Dutch women work full time for employers, vs. 65% of men. However, 32% of working-age women in the Netherlands work part time by choice, the highest proportion of any country in the world. As in other places, traditional gender roles account for women's lower likelihood to have full-time jobs -- but Dutch society has compensated, at least in part"}

{"idx": "9966", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Johnny Depp has broken his silence about his controversial casting in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. Depp has been off in his world for quite some time now, which has led to some very public controversies. The actor has been accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which has not sat well with Harry Potter fans. The fact that the production and J.K. Rowling kept him in the film has left many fans with a feeling of disappointment.\nWhen asked about the controversy surrounding his casting in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Johnny Depp did not sidestep the question and answered it. The question came at the end of the interview where he spoke about the intricacies of his character and how well he knew the Harry Potter franchise before signing on. Depp had this to say when asked about the backlash around his casting in the sequel.\n\"I'll be honest with you, I felt bad for J.K. having to field all these various feelings from people out there. I felt bad that she had to take that. But ultimately, there is real controversy. The fact remains I was falsely accused, which is why I'm suing the Sun newspaper for defamation for repeating false accusations. J.K. has seen the evidence and therefore knows I was falsely accused, and that's why she has publicly supported me. She doesn't take things lightly. She would not stand up if she didn't know the truth. So that's really it.\"\nJohnny Depp's denial of the domestic abuse claims and playing the part of the victim did not go over very well with Amber Heard's legal team. Her lawyers say that Depp is \"shamefully continuing his psychological abuse of Ms. Heard.\" Additionally, they say that that the actress is trying to put the whole thing behind her. The two released a joint statement last year that insinuated that abuse had happened, but Heard and her team criticized J.K. Rowling and the production of cherry-picking the lines that fit their narrative.\nAs for the cast of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, they all had good things to say about working with Johnny Depp when the controversy was going on. One cast member said that he was only \"sweet and professional,\" while another member was blown away by his ability to adlib and add personal touches to the character on the fly. J.K. Rowling also stands by her original stance and is very happy with what Depp has contributed to the sequel.\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is set to hit theaters next month, and many are wondering how it will do at the box office, mainly for keeping Johnny Depp on board. That remains to be seen, but Depp lives in a world of his own, as evidenced by a recent interview where he talked about wanting to make a Titanic remake in his bathtub with a straight face. Whatever the case may be, he's already signed on for Fantastic Beasts 3. You can read the entire interview with Johnny Depp over at Entertainment Weekly."}

The contestant was reportedly airlifted to a hospital but he suffered a series of cardiac arrests and died. That in itself is a tragic story, and a startling one when we consider his age. Now THR is reporting that Thierry Costa, the staff doctor of Koh-Lanta has committed suicide, and it sounds like his choice to end his life was directly related to the incident with the show.\n\"Unjust accusations and assumptions have been made against me,\" Costa said in his suicide note, going on to say, \"I am sure I treated Gerald with respect as a patient and not as a contestant.\"\nThis news comes after an anonymous source reportedly claimed that producers declined to give Babin immediate medical attention for up to nine minutes \"so as not to interrupt shooting,\" and that he was transported by boat - rather than helicopter - to a local infirmary because the cost of a helicopter was too expensive. The source says Babin wasn't transferred to a hospital until nearly two hours after his initial collapse.\nIt's hard to pass any judgment on the claims that have been made without knowing all of the details. If Babin was only complaining of arm cramps, which might not be particularly alarming after a tough swim and a game of tug-of-war, it's not entirely surprising that they might not want to stop filming and rush him to a hospital. But there's likely more to this story. Babin's family is seeking damages on the basis of \"illegal conditions and breaches of health and safety,\" and French authorities have begun investigating the matter, including the circumstances surrounding Babin's treatment, which may lead to manslaughter charges. If that's the case, this may be just the beginning, especially if people involved in the production of the show are brought up on charges., and who knows how that might affect the production of other reality shows.\nIt kind of reminds me of the nurse who took her own life after that Australian radio show duo played a prank on the U.K. hospital where Dutchess Kate was staying. Except in this case, it's tragedy on top of tragedy, and it doesn't sound like it's anywhere near being resolved. In the meantime, it's sad news to hear of Costa's passing, and our thoughts go out to his family and those affected by his loss."}

This year marks the last of the series of this monitoring process with a closing report tracking 15 years of the global partnership for development. As has been reported throughout the monitoring process, there have been significant positive developments pointing to an effective international partnership in the five domains, but several deficits in development cooperation have continuously highlighted the need for a rejuvenation of the global partnership for development.\nThe report finds that ODA increased substantially over the MDG period, although ODA to LDCs has declined in recent years. Additionally, global trade of goods and services expanded significantly over the last fifteen years to more than USD20 trillion, with improved levels of participation by developing countries. However, a key challenge of MDG 8 has been the failure of the international community to conclude the Doha Development Round after 13 years of negotiation. This failure has had ramifications for the potential of trade as an enabler of economic growth and development. Debt relief initiatives have alleviated debt burdens of many developing countries, but the need for enhanced policies towards debt crisis prevention and resolution remains to address the concerns of other vulnerable countries whose debt problems remain unresolved. Monitoring studies on access to affordable essential medicines have repeatedly shown that, in general, access remains insufficient and, in particular, that generic medicines are significantly less available in public health facilities than in private health facilities. Finally, the report notes that access to new technologies, in particular information and communication technologies has grown tremendously since 2000 but these impressive gains observed during the MDG era continue to be marred by a digital divide between developed and developing countries."}

This is good advice, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nYou may love something on a bare wall in a well-lighted shop or a gallery, or even online, but how can you be sure you\u2019ll love it as much once you get it home?

A single large piece\u2014say, four by five feet\u2014is more dramatic than several smaller ones. \u201cA lot of people are afraid of where they\u2019re going to put a big piece again if they move,\u201d says Michael LaConte, owner of Homey (3656 N. Lincoln Ave., 773-248-0050), a North Center gallery that specializes in af-fordable art. But he thinks the virtues of size outweigh hypothetical problems down the road. \u201cHave a great piece so that as you walk into the room, it sets the tone,\u201d he advises. A big gicl\u00e9e print, which uses a digital process to re-create a painting or photograph with paint pigment rather than ink, is a way to do this without going into debt. Gicl\u00e9es generally go for a small fraction of the cost of the original and are available from many emerging artists. And unlike a poster, a gicl\u00e9e print on canvas or ragstock looks almost like the real thing."}

The fortunes of Haidilao founders are among one of the world's fastest-growing.\nCHINA'S insatiable demand for spicy hotpot is placing the founders of a restaurant chain atop one of the world's fastest-growing fortunes, allowing them to outpace many of the wealthiest families globally.\nAs of Monday, Zhang Yong, chairman of Haidilao International Holding Ltd, and his wife Shu Ping, had grown US$6 billion richer in 2019, a 79 per cent jump in just over three months.\nThat pace is the fastest in Asia and globally only topped by Australian mining baron Andrew Forrest, who has doubled his fortune this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, a ranking of the world's 500 richest people.\nHaidilao went public in September, and it's been a lucrative time for China's largest hotpot chain, popular for the spicy broths in which diners cook their meats and vegetables. The company is pushing to make its restaurants more efficient by creating automated kitchens. Perks like the free manicures it offers waiting customers have kept families coming in. And the brand is expanding overseas with new locations planned in New York and London.\nLast year, revenue surged 60 per cent to 17 billion yuan (S$3.43 billion), and that's helping to push the stock up more than 75 per cent this year. At about US$21 billion, the company's market value is now higher than Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.\n\"A good set of results has resulted in the stock rallying to new highs,\" said Tristan D'Aboville, an analyst at William O'Neil & Co, pointing to increases in sales growth and new restaurants added in the second half of last year.\nAnother power couple behind Haidilao, co-founder and executive director Shi Yonghong and his wife Li Haiyan, have also grown 79 per cent wealthier this year, based on Monday's data. Their fortune is now worth US$6.4 billion.\nStill, the enthusiasm for Haidilao's stock has made it increasingly expensive. Recently valued at about 47 times projected earnings for the next 12 months, it's around four times more expensive than Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nChina's increasingly competitive hotpot market is projected to grow at a compounded annual rate of more than 10 per cent, with revenue topping 700 billion yuan by 2022, according to consultancy Frost & Sullivan.\nBesides small, privately owned restaurants, there are other competing brands like the publicly listed Xiabuxiabu Catering Management China Holdings. Haidilao has a less than 3 per cent share of the Chinese hotpot market, according to its September prospectus.\nIn an October interview, Haidilao's chief strategy officer, Zhou Zhaocheng, said the company sees room to grow by offering customers diverse choices, better service and by creating new experiences for them.\nSo far it has kept Chinese consumers loyal by making their visits more fun.

That's the day I plan to join hundreds of others at Seattle's Town Hall to talk about how we can change Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer, and change America for the better.\nWal-Mart has become a symbol of the wrong direction in our economy -- big, profitable employers paying low wages, shifting employee health care costs to taxpayers, harming small businesses and communities.\nMy husband and I own a small business. We knew of Wal-Mart but we learned much more after the company proposed a store near our home in Mill Creek. Mill Creek has grown fast in recent years, which has caused traffic congestion and other problems.\nI learned that the company's proposed store would cause not just negative environmental impacts from traffic and storm water runoff but also a number of negative social impacts: crime, unfair labor practices, a pattern of gender discrimination and harm to nearby small businesses that are undercut by the company's ultra-low prices. Many of my neighbors in Mill Creek came to the same conclusion. I decided to get involved and ask the tough questions in determining whether Wal-Mart was right for our community.\nWhile the average shopper at Wal-Mart can expect to save $500 per year, those savings are illusionary because of the way Wal-Mart shifts costs to taxpayers.\nLee Scott, Wal-Mart's president, detailed the company's exploitive practices when he revealed the strategy of clustering stores to drive out competition, then to systematically thin out their stores. There are currently more than 400 empty stores across this country. As Wal-Mart moves into a new city, it looks for tax abatements and perks from that city's council. Back-room favors, relaxed environmental regulations and tax cuts are not offered to any other company in exchange for promises of jobs. If a city doesn't want to play ball, the store simply builds just outside the city limits.\nThe average Wal-Mart employee makes $2,000 below the national poverty level. Each Wal-Mart store on average costs the community up to $420,000 per year. Those costs come from many public assistance programs such as $108,000 per year for children's health care costs and $42,000 per year for low-income housing assistance, per store. Currently, Wal-Mart's unaffordable health care leaves more than half its employees without company heath care at a $1.39 billion yearly cost to taxpayers. These jobs also come at the expense of competing stores, with better pay and benefits, which eventually are forced out of business as they cannot compete with the taxpayer-subsidized Wal-Mart.\nThat has dramatically pulled the rug out from under middle-class America. If workers make less, their discretionary spending is drastically reduced. Businesses providing goods and services cannot survive without a healthy and prosperous middle class.\nI believe in capitalism and the unique opportunity we have in this country to take the risk of starting a new venture. I also believe that we as consumers and citizens must demand that powerful businesses play fair.\nA Change Wal-Mart America bus tour, which has crossed the country to educate citizens of the company's unfair labor practices and true costs to our communities, arrives in Seattle for a Labor Day Rally, featuring Sen. Patty Murray, at 6 p.m. Monday at Town Hall."}
